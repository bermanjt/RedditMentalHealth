0,"To make a long story short I had a bad drug experience where I thought I lost everyone in my life and that they were all dead. This was roughly two months ago. This seemed to have a terrible effect on my brain and me the following day and I can‚Äôt describe the feelings I had. I felt so anxious and depressed and nothing felt real. It was like my brain was still telling me that the people in my life are still gone but logically I knew they weren‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt emotionally  feel anything. I started therapy a month ago and in my last session (3rd EMDR session) I talked about what happened that night. I told myself everyone was still there and I‚Äôm not alone anymore and I cried with sadness and happiness throughout. This might sound stupid or crazy but I could literally feel something moving in my brain for a day. It was like there was a knot in my head and untied a bit. As if there was a release of some pressure. It was so weird and powerful but yet so amazing as I can literally feel me becoming ME again if that makes sense. The next few days I have started to feel way better and can see massive improvements already. I can connect a small bit back to people again. 

The last two months have been hell like dealing with this (I can say so much more about how it felt  but I won‚Äôt haha). Just wanted to share and for ye to let me know what ye think :) ",05Apr2019,1

2,"I'm in a pretty bad situation. 
I'm in love with my best friend (she knows it), but she is not with me. Ok fine.
In the past 6 month she did almost everything possible to make me feel calm for everything about her 'cause she knows I have very rough panic attacks for everything. But now, I just want for her to be free from my anxiety. She is not living her life, just for me.
So yesterday we discussed and I said that from now on she'll never see my saddness or fear. I'll keep everything to me, just to let her live.
And so she did. As of now she is with one of our friends...and he...he has been (last year) the main reason of my mental problems.
So now I'm...I don't know. It's hard. I'mnot in a good place in my head. And keeping everything to myself is maybe too hard. I'm on the verge of a panic attack again. But I don't want her to know this.
...so I decided to come here. I just wanted to tell my story. I just want to talk. I just want to be free.
Thank you",05Apr2019,1
3,"Im just here to vent i guess. I recently quit my full time job, because at $7.58 an hour i was making to much to get state healthcare, so i got a part time job at 25 hours a week for $9.00 an hour so i could get state insurance and find some help. Im 24 and still live with my parents and want desperately to move out, but in being able to afford to do so i would lose my insurance and probably wouldnt make enough to afford insurance. It seems like my options are between intentional self sabotage to get the help i need or intentional self sabotage to get the money to move forward in life. Theres no way i could find a job that pays well enough to afford insurance or offers benefits in the state of mind i find myself in (i went on a rant at my last job about how there is no future and were all fucked, and was throwing things and swearing a lot, luckily i was surrounded by loving people who also have mental health disorders and understood what i was going through) and ill never afford to live independently while maintaining state insurance. I feel like there are no options for me. Im in between a rock and a hard place with no way out. Im stuck... I can either get treatment (see doctors and get the meds i need) or i can have a well paying job and inevitably and perpetually suffer the consequences of mental illness. ",05Apr2019,3
4,"My husband has been on Zoloft for nearly four months, after his anxiety and on-and-off depression came to a head. He is up to 125mg a day, and I don't see it making a difference. He still gets overwhelmed very easily, and has had a few panic attacks in the past month. As far as I know, he had had one panic attack before starting medication.

&amp;#x200B;

We're at the point where I cannot say anything remotely triggering, which is most things. He has asked me to refrain from any sort of conflict, and in his delicate state, that is very challenging, since his definition of conflict is quite broad.

&amp;#x200B;

He is working weekly with a psychiatrist, whose opinion I'm not sure I entirely trust. This doctor told my husband that he suspects that I myself am dealing with depression, and that I should get a psychiatric evaluation. Being pre-diagnosed from second-hand stories, from someone I've never met, doesn't give me great confidence in this man.

7,"Hey guys I'm a 20 year old guy with a pretty good life. I live with my loving supportive family, I have a good job and i have a few very good friends but I feel so alone and empty. Some days i have trouble getting myself to just wake up and go to work because i dont see any point. My life seems pointless. It sounds cliche but I feel like if I died tomorrow no one would really miss me, sure my friends and family would be sad but in a year or so they would move on and in the end the world would carry on just fine without me. Nothing really interest me any more and if something does it seems too difficult to do/achieve so I just forget about it and move on. I dont try to meet new people any more because just about every deep emotional connection I have had in the past ends in pain. So I wake up, go to work, come home and do it all over again. I guess I just feel like I'm stuck and I cant muster up the drive to try and fix anything in my life for fear of failure. I just dont know what to do any more.

basically all my memories feel distant. i can remember, say, the random thing my mum told me as a kid to make me not do something, but that first paragraph i typed feels so distant like i did it long ago. my head feels foggy, almost as if im kinda on another planet and i have to shake it to get back to earth and remind myself im still on the ground. my hands are very strange looking. like, i know theyre there but i dont know how theyre there or how theyre moving the way i want them to, it just doesnt make sense and i dont believe it in a way. everything feels out of place in a ""how the hell am i here"" way and i sometimes lose track of what im saying mid sentence and start babbling random crud. i zone out to stare at walls and just think and lately have stopped showing people how i feel and instead i purposefully change my expression to make myself feel ""numb"" so i don't get upset and kinda get away from my feelings until im alone i guess. i just constantly feel stunned and spaced out if that makes sense.

Without getting too into her past experiences, she was emotionally abused and made to do sexual favors, and then stalked by the human garbage. This happened about 4-5 years ago and she sill has trust issues and emotional issues because of it. I am new to relationships, I've only had one long term relationship before this for two years and it ended abruptly and suddenly. Because of that I also am insecure with relationships and I was not sure if she actually liked me for a while. She does but she has a hard time showing it, and I've accepted that because I really like her. She has a hard time expressing herself to me which is fine but a little frustrating because I don't have much of a filter and I say what I feel to her.

She refuses to get help. She won't see a therapist and she won't take medication because she doesn't want to depend on it her whole life. She saw a therapist initially but it made the anxiety and depression worse leading to a suicide attempt, so she won't try again. I keep telling her she needs to talk to someone if not me, or try meds but she won't budge. 

Also, occasionally she will get very defensive with me about seemingly very random things, which does tend to lead to fights because it makes me upset and then she gets upset because of that. What should I do when this happens? She also never apologizes for doing it, which is also a little frustrating because it makes me feel bad, like I did something to upset her(enter, insecurity). 

 All of this being said, I have a few questions.

How do I help her get help? What can I do?

Will she ever open up to me? I see glimpses of her true self every now and then but I want to know everything about her, and it's frustrating that I can't.

If anyone would like to share experiences of dating someone with ptsd I'd love to hear them. Or if you suffer from ptsd I'd love to hear firsthand about these questions or the troubles we are having.

26,"I'm writing this for my girlfriend, just as a heads up, as she doesn't really use Reddit. Also not entirely sure this is the right subreddit, so please let me know if there is somewhere more appropriate to post!

Recently, my girlfriend's friend from high school passed away (We are currently seniors in college, if that's important), and its ignited her fear of death. This was a fear born when she was sixteen and witnessed the funeral of her aunt through a video call. 

I can tell how deeply this fear has affected her. When she was sixteen, she said it made her contemplate suicide. She told me that not only did she cry often, its also the reason why she wears socks at night, because she saw how blue her aunt's feet were, and this terrified her. According to her, she couldnt sleep alone, and it was hard to go through the day. It also drove her to seek comfort in religion, because it gave her hope that there was life after death, that there's a meaning to all her suffering.

This fear resurfaced again these past couple weeks. Every night, she struggles to keep herself from crying. She often confides in me to say that sometimes its hard for her to understand what the point of life is, understand why she should bother continuing to live and struggle if she's just going to die. She says she doesn't understand how when you die everything in your body just stops working. She wants to know that  souls exist, that there is an afterlife of some kind. It's an existential nightmare for her, and I really don't know how to help, especially since I personally cannot stand religion. 

Of course, I told her to seek therapy, but it isnt an option for her. Being that we are Indian, our parents unfortunately dont take mental health very seriously, and tell her to just suck it up and stop crying. She can't pay for therapy on her own, since she doesn't have the money.

27,"Call it your Achilles Heel, a struggle, tough times, etc‚Ä¶ Some people have a few ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs‚Äù and some have many. Some can manage them easier than others. As my therapist continues to tell me, there isn‚Äôt one person on this planet that somehow has everything put together; despite what pop culture and social media like to portray and perpetuate.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are both recovering alcoholics/addicts. I was fortunate enough to not be bitten by that gene/Achilles heel. My Achilles heel and struggle has always been, and will continue to be, food. Over eating. Compulsive eating. Binge eating. Was 295lbs when I was in college, lost 150lbs over 2 years and now have been a little more all over the place with my weight (hovering around 215lbs). It‚Äôs my individual journey and process; we all have our own way to manage and cope with stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm writing this post to maybe break that virtual 4th wall and have an open convo about our struggles. Even if we are ashamed, embarrassed, too proud, etc‚Ä¶ being able to talk about it and recognize it is the start of change. Change takes time. It‚Äôs a process. Starts with pre-contemplation then contemplation, action, maintenance and finally, relapse (as much as we don‚Äôt want that part of change).

&amp;#x200B;

Gaining some weight back is not a failure at all, but instead is a learning tool for me to learn new ways to manage how not to serve myself twice at dinner. How to find smarter ways to order out and not eat everything on my plate at a restaurant. How to distract myself at parties when there is a seemingly endless array of foods and I just feel this impulse to eat more than my body asks for. I‚Äôve tried everything from counting how many times I chew. Using small plates and utensils. Ordering off of the kids menu or appetizers only. Sometimes these tools don‚Äôt work and sometimes it helps. It is a DAILY task to pay attention and monitor myself. I like making food at home because I am in control of my plate. I only put what I need in front of me because I will most likely eat the entire thing. I have to loosely plan what I‚Äôm going to eat throughout the day otherwise I will find myself foraging and mindlessly eating anything I can get my hands on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some days I have to remind myself that butter has the same emotion value as an apple. Pizza and salad share the same emotional value. Nutritionally is another story, however, neither is ‚Äúgood‚Äù nor ‚Äúbad‚Äù‚Ä¶ it just food. That takes work and repetition. I use to fear going to parties and outings because I felt I couldn‚Äôt control myself. One cookie was good. Then 2 was fun. 3 was a mental game‚Ä¶ then I forgot how many I ate and my stomach now hurts. This is what I deal with.

29,"For the past 4 months, I've been having attacks of rapid heart rate, usually not accompanied by chest pain or anything else.   They tend to happen while driving or riding in a car, 80% or more of the time.  (and, no, I do not have any anxiety or fear about riding in a car)  A few days after the rapid HR incidents started,  I also started having occasional pain in back below right shoulder blade and yellow stool.  they don't usually happen at the exact same time, but sometimes they do, and sometimes having a bowel movement provides relief,including from a rapid heart rate incident.  But only sometimes, vast majority of the time they are not concurrent. A few other things, but nothing consistent.  Keep in mind it's just pale/yellowish, it is not diarrhea any more often than I've ever had diarrhea normally.

First thing done was a chest CT scan, and it found nothing but a few granulomas.   Then a few days later an ultrasound found a gallstone, but, to skip ahead a bit, another US was done 2 months later showing no damage or even change from it, and a HIDA scan showed normal function.   So the gallstone did seem like the culprit due to the pale stool but after further testing, seems asymptomatic and not related.

Back after the first US though, I then had a hyperthyroid reaction to the iodine from the CT scan, and I spent 3-4 weeks recovering from that (this is confirmed by a normal iodine uptake scan and the fact that thyroid levels came back down while off thyroid medication).   

I've also had treadmill stress EKG which found nothing. Over 4 months I've probably been to the ER like 10 times (and that means I've likely toughed it out 30-40 times), but of course, they only check to make sure I'm not having a heart attack, and they also do CMP to check liver.  Nothing else, so no matter how many times I go, they may hurt my wallet but they do nothing to broaden the range of tests that have been done.  I always explain everything, including the back pain and yellow stools.   Either way,  it's almost certainly not cardiac unless it's something that wouldn't show in 10 EKGs over a 4 month period plus a stress test.  

During those 3 weeks of high thyroid, my heart rate was elevated a bit all day, but I didn't have any specific HR attacks, which I find intersting.  However, a couple of weeks after I got better from that, i.e. late Jan/early Feb, the high HR attacks came back as well as the back pain and yellow stool.   And obviously I started vigorously following up with the doctor about it, and he wanted me to try buspar, an anxiety medication....so I did, which made it 3 times worse (went from 4-5 times/week to 2-3 times/day).   On the day he said to try the buspar, I didn't push back, I knew he was about to blame anxiety but I figured I had the time to try the buspar and let it fail, but it got worse (which I later realized was ***due*** to the buspar), so I went to a behavioral health clinic who agreed that I probably don't have general anxiety disorder or panic disorder, and armed with that, I go back to the doctor, and he basically says he doesn't care what they said, if I don't have GAD or Panic disorder then I've got illness anxiety disorder.  

&amp;#x200B;

Which makes no sense to me....think back to when this started, I didn't have any thoughts or considerations about my health then, at all (and no problems at work, home, etc either, just to cover all the bases) and this all started out of nowhere.   Do I have anxiety about it NOW?  Yea, probably, but I don't see how that matters, I did NOT when this all started.  So speaking of the original onset of this, how could  I just suddenly start having health anxiety for no reason? 

It just doesn't fit.  I mean, yes, the frustration of these continued attacks has made me start getting upset when they happen, but who wouldn't after it happening for 4 months with no answers?    I don't have any other indications of anxiety: I sleep well at night, I function at work, etc, and when these attacks occur, they are not accompanied by any of the other anxiety/panic attack symptoms like sweating, etc. I know that EKGs/bloodwork/Chest Ct and abdominal US looks at a lot, but it doesn't look at everything, and it seems just a little premature to label me a hypochondriac at this point.    And, remember back to the hyperthyroid incident, I spent a few days dealing with anxiety accusations then too, but finally a walk in clinic that was open during the holidays was smart enough to run T4 instead of relying on just TSH.  After that, there's no way I'm going to lightly accept blame on anxiety...

Anyway, so I went to another doctor for a second opinion on this, and she said no I don't ""have anxiety"", but that ""this is likely due to some serotonin brain chemical imbalance"".   I realize that the true causes of psychiatric illnesses are still poorly understood, but isn't brain chemical imbalances one of the likely causes of many psychiatric illnesses?  And if so, isn't telling me I have a brain chemical imbalance, just a nicer way of blaming it on anxiety or other psychosomatic disorders?  It just seems like a nicer way of saying that same thing as the other doctor except avoiding calling it hypochondria/illness anxiety disorder.   Plus, her recommendation was Prozac, which seems to be aimed squarely at anxiety/depression, I don't see any descriptions of its uses/treated conditions that match the way she explained it.  

I am trying it, and for 2 days I thought it was helping but on day 3 I've had 3 attacks again, which had not happened since I stopped the buspar.

So first, can serotonin imbalances really cause physical symptoms like this, in the absence of any ""real"" disease?  And if they can, how can these imbalances just start happening for no reason?  the ony medical reason I can rfind for serotonin problems is carcinoid syndrome/carcinoid tumors, but, I mean, the only symptom I have from the list of carcinoid syndrome symptoms is rapid heart rate, so I don't think it's that.  

Could aspartame have any involvement with this?  ",05Apr2019,1

I want to share something that has been happening as of late. May i provide a little backstory? I was the very fat kid that got bullied terribly for being, ""acting gay and fat"". So much so that i tired to kill myself in middle school. To this day I still have bouts of fear and depression about my body being viewed as, ""disgusting"", ""a waste of space"", etc.. It doesn't happen a lot much around my age now (23), but it still gets me very depressed.

In high school before I went to college, i told my self that I needed to fix my self before others would change how the speak to me and how they view me. I started exercising like crazy. I starved myself and the wight started to drop. I was like 240 lbs at my heaviest (2011) then went do to 190 (2013. Freshmen year of college. I don't remember when i started to get to this weight).

I had seen my friends go out to parties. I would tag along, but it just didn't feel right talking to girls, romantically. I knew i only wanted dick but it didn't click until I got help. The campus offered counselling. One day the switch flipped and I told myself that I needed to get help for many reasons.

Through months of much needed therapy (counselling), I was comfortable coming out as gay, and stop pretending to be someone who I am not. I started talking to guys and I was in love how I could talked to some people that got me. While I somewhat regret who I lost my virginity to, I more so regret how it happened, how I didn't find someone who wanted me for me.

I was still depressed over many things. I brought myself into a very vicious cycle of having someone who I want to be with, then getting wayyyyy to attached to him, while he only wants to fuck. I get my young ignorant heart broken time and time again. For most of the time when I was I having sex, I had this messed up idea that I just had to please the other guy. Sex almost never felt good; I was a bottom if you can't tell by now. When the guy would get bored, he would leave and I go into bouts of depression witch did nothing good for my school grades.

TO sum up my psych experience, I went to a psychiatrist and when I told her what was happening, she incorrectly diagnosed me with schizophrenia. Over the course of like 2 ish years, I was on one psych med to another, not really helping me; Doing nothing but giving my terrible side effects. I was so tired that I was sleeping in most of my classes, while being so mad at myself that I couldn't sleep during the night. My white blood cell count cell was so low that if I caught an infection, I could have died. The icing on the cake was that me just being black just made [matters worse.](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)61568-1/pdf) To sum up, African americans who take anti-psychotics have an increased change of bad side effects, such as having lower levels of WBC's, Neutrophils, and platelets than white individuals. (My psych NP said it was called the African American Disadvantage- just a great thing to have. /s)

My NP wouldn't listen to me for months when I told her that the meds weren't doing me any good, and I wanted adderall. I have an overactive imagination and think of too many things at once, including having conversations with people who aren't there. These people are people I know exist. The ""voices"" my NP calls them never told me to hurt myself or others. I never thought songs were written just for me. I don't think people are out to get me. They were never voices, They were people. I hope you can tell the difference in what I'm saying. What was really good was that my blood levels were so low, even after changing anti-psychotic meds that my NP told me to stop taking them. I had seen my primary care physician (PNP), and I told him I wanted adderall and he agreed. Once I told y NP that my PCP wanted me on adderall, She finally gave me a script. BOOM.

I feel so much better than I ever did on those anti-psychotic meds. I was actually starting to feel ""normal"". I was dealing with depression, anxiety, and love issues too, and during this time, I was only seeing a psych NP for meds, no counseling. After a few months, I was still depressed as thought I needed counseling.

It was a low point in my life at this point. I spent like 4 years in college, only to realize I didn't even want to finish it; I stopped caring an it showed on my grades. I always had major issues with my family. My dad was never really ""close with me"". I know he cares for me. HE gives me money and is there when I need him but he never really showed love to me. I remember a few years before this point, I was in the airport about to board. This other dad and son hugged and the dad told his don, "" I love you son, be safe"". The son said, ""I love you too dad"".

I told my dad, ""alright, see you later"". My dad said, ""alright"".

There aren't enough words to describe my mother and her side of my family. As a whole, they all are emotionally and physically abusive to each other, including to me when I was a child. This type of environment led me to have terrible social anxiety, not knowing how to express my feelings to and for other people. Also, because of this environment, I didn't really know how a healthy relationship, in any respect, should be. This was the main cause of my anxiety, depression, etc... since, the start of my existence. It's like I want to make friends, I had thoughts like, ""the guy/ gay is so cool! I really want to get to know them and be friends!"". Outwardly, i would appear to seem cold, and unfriendly. I was so mad at myself. I would see opportunity after opportunity just pass by and I hated how I didn't have the strength to overcome my fear of anxiety, and being viewed as not wanted to do what I wanted to do. I was trapped in my house and I didn't feel comfortable telling what very little friends I had at the time, or my family. My family is the typical black family that when topics of mental health, my issues, how I didn't like how my mom's part of the family treated each other, people outside of the family, and me, I would get shot down and made to feel like absolute shit. Imagine years of this nonsense and dependent of these people.

When I was fully out to them, they were already aware but during the initial time of me being vocal about being only homosexual, they didn't want to discuss it much. I grew to hate them all at this point. I had such a hatred for these people that I literally had **countless** thoughts of physically hurting these people if they ever put their hands on me again. I never acted on these actions. I knew better. I felt and feel as though if I ever did something with murderous, malicious intent, I would be just like them. Since reaching adolescence, I started to drift away from the family for obvious reasons. I utterly hated to be around them. When I was (and still to this day am) around them, I just started acting like them. I always try, to this date view all of the shit I went through when I was younger was a learning experience. How to speak to people with respect, listen to what they have to say, and respond in a manner where you can disagree on the topic and have life go on. How love should actually being given and shown. Just how to be an all around nice, respectful adult.

I took a break off of school to figure out what I wanted to do. (My parents divorced when I was 1 y.o..).

I was living with my mom and I started going crazy. I hated the environment I was in. I knew I wanted to go back to school for nursing, but wanted to go back when I was in a good place. I am the type of person that I CAN'T STAND WHEN people tell me what to do, say, act, and think. It is the WORST thing someone can do to me.

1. Here are some highlights of my wonderful mother. She ""forgets"" certain things. I know she goes through my mail. I remember I came home one day and a letter that was a check, or looked like a check from the outside (I can't remember) was opened. I asked why was my letter open. She said, ""Oh I was going through the mail so quick I thought it was mine and opened it by accident"". U t t e r B u l l s h i t. When she said that, I put together a few things: My name and hers are different (obviously). Why was none of her mail opened? The only opened piece of mail was mine. I brought the interaction up later with her to see what she would say, and she claimed full ignorance. O K. The same thing happened to my sister who moved in a few months after this incident. Played out the exact same way. She is a manipulative, controlling person. She always wants to have her hand in other people's pockets. She is a faithful christian, according to her. ~~Yep~~.

My grandmother told me that when her then newest future ex-husband found work, she was furious that he didn't immediately give her money when he got paid. She went along with him to estimates (he is a carpenter/handyman) just to see how much he would be making. Controlling, huh? I didn't really like him or dislike him, but I didn't like how she was treating him.

2. She keeps bringing up school. I keep on telling her I was going back when I was ready. I can't stand repeating myself. The conversation would happen ad infinitum.

* me: ""I'm going back when I'm ready""
* her: ""You need to hurry up and finsh school already""
* me: ""you know with the expensive lifestyle I want to have, I want a degree right? You already know I will go back and finish. You know I don't like living here. Why are we still having the same conversation again and again and again??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"" (getting to be angry at this point)
* her: ""don't be disrespectful to me! Who do you think your'e talking to ?! (Her catch phrase that was beat to death by my 10th b day I swear.)
* me: You know I don'y like repating myself. why do you keep doing this, knwoing it'll get me angry?
* her: It's because I am your mother! (Her other fave catch phrase I loath to hear. She only uses this when she knows she is wrong but won't own up to it)
* internal thought: (what the F U C K does that have to do with how people should be treated? Just because someone birthed you into the world, they can degrade you, speak to you like shit,and you just accept it as your fate?)
* *argue back and forth for who knows how long*
* her: ***Well do you just want me to stop asking you? (Remember her saying this)***
* me: YESS!!
* her: okay, fine

Some time passes and here we go again. We have a few more arguments when I finally bring up the conversation above.

* me: Don't you remember the time when you said we weren't going to discuss this anymore?
* her: Yes, but I don't care, I am your mother
* me: .....
* me:.....
* me: So you lied to my face? just to shut me up
* her: to sum she says, ""yes, because I'm your mother, blah, blah, say as i do and do as I say""

I just walk away.

now I'm not just some degenerate. I always had a drive for science and healthcare. My grandma was a GNA. My fav cousin and aunt are both nurses. I loved watching the medical shows. When I first starting working at an assited living home, it was tough work, but I grew to love it. I could just see it in their eyes that they truly loved me and cared for me. They would light up when I am in eyesight. Not many can understand what it feels like to see a person who can't speak clearly, nor express their actions concisely, do so non verbally. I just love it. I made sure that they were always loved, clean, and taken care of, till the last day on earth. I remember when my favorite patient was about to expire and I walked in her room. She was surrounded by family, whom she didn't know (dementia &amp; they didn't come enough for their adult faces to stick). She looked dead. Had that 1000 yeard stare and was just laying in bed. When I walked into her eye sight, her eyes moved and they lit up. She reached for my hand and I reached for hers. I could see that she was with it, knew who I was and why I came when I came. I can't explain in words what I'm trying to say.

in only a few years of being in nursing/healthcare field giving care and being a medication tech, I was promoted to be a supervisor of a 100 (something) bed assisted living home, at the age of 21. At night, I was the supervisor, the head in the building. I would respond to emergencies ( fall, death, change in metal status, etc..), in addition to give medication to the entire facility, and care (when asked). I thrived. I loved the pressure, the craziness of it all. I loved being pulled into many directions, lives depending on me, and I have to figure out what to do so that everyone is safe. Of course I have to send word to my boss if I truly needed them, but they had full faith in my judgement. Perfect reviews all around. Bought a new car with only my name on it. I knew i had a drive for health care, and making money. I knew I needed to increase my education so accomplish my goals.

My mom, and my my aunt kept on asking me when am I going to back to school. We all agree that I have the drive to go go to school, and will finish. The thing is, they want me to do what they want. They want me to go back to school at this point. I could have, but I would have to scrape cash together. I knew that if I was forced to go to school again, without me having the same thought, it would be a waste of my money, body, and sanity; If that makes sense. I was working night shift at this point. I loved working nights, once I became used to it, but hated coming home. My mom wouldn't respect me at all. I asked again and again for her to not talk so loud (scream) to people on the phone. There is a tv in the living room, and in her bedroom. She would have both on, and it seem like on max volume. Nobody can sleep like that. That isn't healthy.

My mom would just brush me off. I feel like I never got more than 3-4 ish hours of sleep. most of the time less than that. It started affecting my body and mind. My friends and coworrkers started to tell me that I wasn't acting normal. I was starting to forget things, I couldn't solve issues as fast as I used to, my intake in food dropped and I started to loose weight in an unhealthy manner.

1. I couldn't keep living like this. My body and soul was being crushed in all aspects of my life and I didn't know what to do. Work was stressful; I was giving my all while my co workers were not and it was frustrating catching, and fixing their mistakes. I would not just see a (*hypothetical)* problem, like medication not matching to their chart or some bruise not documented, and just walk away. I just can't.
2. My romantic life was anything but. I was in a much better place than where I was a few years ago but I was still settling for men who would take advantage of me in different ways or just not give me what i was yearning for (read: love).
3. My crazy, god awful, dysfunctional family.

I knew I needed help. I wanted to try counselling again. When I was finished seeing my NP for refill on my meds, I asked if they also have counselling services. They did and I eventually got set up with a wonderful woman who I will be forever grateful for. Without her being the catalyst to making me fully realize who I am and what I could do, I'd still be in the terrible situation. I should get her a card. I can't begin to express how thankful I was to me this woman who I will call, ""SK"".

If you can't tell, I am very wary of people get to know me, like really know me. I don't like letting my guard down in fear of getting hurt, and like to keep things away. I can remember our first meeting and I was very skittish. I din;t know who on earth this woman was or what she was about. So many things were floating in my head while I was feeling her out (like how she works and how I would react to her) in the first few sessions

* Who is she really?
* What is she about?
* Why was I assigned to her?
* What will she be thinking of me when I speak?
* How will she react when I say certain things? What will her nonverbal cues tell me about her?
* How defensive should I be at first?
* Should I just say what and how I fell or do i have to dress it up in a certain way?
* What do I speak about first?
* I see she doesn't write down notes during session (she says she types after the session is over. What will she type?
* To what extent would she write about me?
* How good is her memory?
* How old is she?
* IS she too young to help me?
* Should I have gotten older, more experienced counselor?
* Is the room going to be cold?
* Should I have requested a male?
* Would I connect more with a male or female?
* What car does she drive?
* Is she married?
* Why/ how is she so confident in her memory? She must see numerous patients.
* How secure is are my files and info?
* Will she talk to my psych NP without me knowing? ((like talking about work at the water cooler. Know what I mean?))
* What if others hear my info?
* What education does she have?
* Why is she in this field?
* With me sharing so much, is she going to tell me things about her?
* what is her life like?
* How long are her sessions?
* Will she remember what I say?
* Will be be lying or sincere in what she says?
* What kind of person will she turn out to be?
* Would she be willing to help me?
* Will she like me?
* Why is she willing to help me? (yes, I was thinking of this, I know)
* Would I be able to tell if she is lying?
* Even if she wanted to help, could she?
* What is her personality like?
* Will I like her personality?
* Will I see results, or will this be a waste of my time and another example of me trying to fix my life, and failing miserably?
* Can I trust her?
* What if she decides to stop seeing me? What would I do then?
* What if she takes my trust and breaks it?
* Should I have never came in the first place?
* Should i never come back?

Just writing all of that was exhausting. Reading all of that over just goes to show how messed up in the head I was. No one can like/ love a person like that. I knew I needed to fix myself first.

It was kind of slow at first (see questions above), but eventually I felt very comfortable going to my visits. I enjoyed the thoughts of going to them, in hindsight.

SK really helped me. She made me realize how messed up my life was. She agreed with me and I liked how she talked. Like I didn't feel like a medical office type counselor(doctor) /patient kind interaction of thing going on. SK helped me realize many things. I was a model patient, with the occasional mess up.

What she asked me to do, like change little things at a time, really added up. I started seeing her around july 2018.

She had me do things like make lists. I don't think I told her I love doing lists but it helped. Like making lists of what I can and can't control. Another list of what To do now, later, eventually. Stress and anxiety coping mechanism too.

I took her advice and knew I was the only person who change my actions for the better, and I went to work. I came to realize many of things:

* I tend to stick to emotionally controlling people who don't return the love/ energy I give them
* I knowingly stick around with these people even though I know I'm hurting
* My life is messed up
* I have accomplished a lot of things for a person of my age
* How I was negatively feeling about my my body and what I was seeing in the mirror.
* My family is fucked to hell
* I can be loved
* Someone is out there (still somewhat skeptical on this. cautiously optimistic) for me that will love me for me

I thought myself hopelessly trapped with no way out. Here is where i am at now:

* Changed jobs! Work at prestigious, world known hospital that I was trying to get into since 2015 ! ( a little stressed because I took a pay cut and they started me much further then I 1st though i was going to work. I need to use some Hollywood accounting until the money comes up again).  

   * It's a total 180 from last job and I like the change so far. Much less stress on my mind and body.

Another reason I got this job was because they have great placement in school and job security

* I realized I had real fucked up past few years. I took a vacation by myself to California for about a week, by myself. I live on the north east. I have never been to Cali and I wanted to experience something far far away. It was amazing
* I moved out of my mom's place into an apt with room mates (I wish I would have put more thought into where I who I was going to live with. They are not as clean as me..)
* I feel amazing about myself. I still have my days where I'm anxious that everyone is looking at me and thinking I look terrible. I never felt as attractive as i do now in my entire life.
* I changed my personality to be more outgoing (in relation to my past self). I'm more friendly and it shows. I'm still kinda shy about meeting new people. The new job I am at has everyone so nice and caring. They ask me all these questions and are so interested in me, like the real ME and what I do with my life. I make good conversation and am friendly but I'm used to childish shit at my last job. It'll get some time before I'm comfortable in my new environment.
* When I realized my mom was the key is my whole mess of a life, it's like everything fell into place and I could see without clouded vision. I moved out and I feel so much better physically and emotionally.
* My headspace is in a great place.
* My love life is getting better. When I changed how I thought about myself to a person who know's their worth, I Just feel more confident and it shows. I'm having tons of men messaging me. Still single. Hope to change soon

An experience occurred which spawned all of this. A big reason for all of this change is because I want a relationship and needed to fix my self. I started to feel more confident in how I take pics of myself. I guess it shows because when I made a new account, It was like over 70 people messaging me wanting to talk and fuck. The old me would have just probably picked he first shitty one and go back into that trap. I have standards now! weird to say (type).

This one guy wasn't the most attractive guy I would have been with by a long shot but something was just different. He was so sweet in the first few messages and we talk for a bit. He has a steady job, looking for a ltr, has the kinda normal/chubby/average guy look that I love, talks to me with respect, and is a big spoon.

The issue came up when i messaged him after a few days of no contact. He work 12 hr shifts, and with my work schedule (wake up at 6a, go to sleep a little after midnight), I don;t have much time to message, and I forgot about him. I cleared some messages and found out thread.

I immediately hit him up and he was in a mood because I didn't message him sooner. I ask why he didn't just message me when he first thought of me. He says he didn't want to message me too much to seem needy.

Uhhh, were both adults. I don't do that, oh I messaged him and I'll wait 3 days until I respond.

**Then he goes on to say that he wanted to put a ring on my finger (first line of my profile I say I'm looking for someone to give me a ring). Right after that, he says, ""Forget (it). I'm a fat ugly white guy. my bad. ""crying face emoji"".**

WTF is going on here?? I say there is no need for self deprecation. Think of yourself better than that. this is not cute!

Immediately in the first few messages, he asked for my number. I said we can just chat on grindr and see what happens. The reason why I messaged him when I was clearing out the other stuff is because I thought he was really cute and wanted to chat and make a date or something. (read: I like the guy)

He goes on to say that I must have tons of dudes messaging me, which is true. I asked him what does that have to do with him? I really don't understand what's wrong here. He gets hurt and I say that it shouldn't matter who or how many men are messaging me, since I was messaging him. (makes sense right? I think he's cute and I want to get to know him, so I message him)

**He says he's going to leave me alone since I'm not his thing.**

**WTF?????**

**Makes no sense to me at all.**

Before therapy, I would be hung up on a guy like him and chase him into the negaverse for his noticing of me. The last message I sent summed up was like, ""In the future don't put off putting things like what you wrote earlier. It's not cute and unattractive. You seemed like ***thee*** type of guy who I'm into""

Makes no sense for your first message to be so nice then get hung up on that an attractive guy is choosing you.

I sent the message, deleted the thread, felt good about myself, put him in the past and went shopping for clothes for my new job!

Therapy does wonders :) Did anyone read all of this? More so for me. I just wanted to write on this experience but i just started writing and feel so much better about many things that have been on my mind as of late.

**TL/DR: Therapy does wonders :) Please seek help. You can't begin to dream of how your life will change after getting professional help. Also maybe make an appt with a provider that prescribes meds; Therapy and meds works very well together.**",05Apr2019,2

As soon as I saw the figure I pulled the blankets over my head and just screamed for my parents who both came in thinking something was seriously wrong. I told them there was a man in my room and they told me it was just a dream but it really didn't feel like it.

Something similar happened a few years after that I was probably 8 or so. I had a nightmare and went to sleep in my parents bed and after they had fallen back asleep and I was dosing off I saw a shadow that kinda looked like a cross between the devil and Apu from Samurai Jack standing in my parents doorway and it walked closer to me and then I pulled the blankets over my head.

I am now 18 and a freshman in college (its second semester) last semester I was asleep and was woken up at 3 am because my roommate was snoring (I'm a very light sleeper) and I look over at her side of the room and see a shadow of a man standing about a foot in front of her closet.

37,"This is a little long please bear with me, I need to get it out. 

I‚Äôve been having a really difficult time. 
Last year I started losing weight. I dropped 20 pounds pretty quickly. I didn‚Äôt do anything differently.. I was just depressed. I‚Äôm always depressed so the weight loss was new for me. I hit some weird emotional spiral, where at first I was motivated to keep losing weight. My motivation was short lived and I went straight to suicidal ideation, every single day. I was irritable and I hated everything. I was falling behind on things I needed to do. I was yelling at everyone. Eventually I would have a drink or two just to fall asleep. I went deeper and deeper into this pit (or so I thought) I was self sabotaging and trying to make people hate me so that if I killed my self, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. I was doing everyone a favor. 

I finally decided to get help. I put myself in a program and was put into group therapy and I started medication. By the time I started noticing a difference with myself (albeit a small one) I had dropped 50lbs total. I had more motivation and I didn‚Äôt want to kill myself and I planned to reach my goal weight of 125lbs (healthy weight for my size) by my birthday. 

After 5 months in the program they decided to ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù me and the lady in charge of me set me up with a therapist. I had to find a new doctor to prescribe my medication. My insurance is SHIT, and I started to give up. I ran out of my medication, went into withdrawal, and now I‚Äôm in the worst mental spiral of my life. 

I don‚Äôt sleep until I‚Äôm convinced ill fall asleep fast with no time to think negative thoughts. I have to be up early in the AM so I average about 2-3 hours asleep each night. I do the very bare minimum to get through the day. I‚Äôm not taking care of myself. I don‚Äôt want to. I sabotaged my online presence in a chat I‚Äôve been a part of for years. I‚Äôve stopped talking to people I considered friends. I‚Äôve gained all the weight back and I eat just to eat and it disgusts me. I feel so fat and disgusting and worthless.

I‚Äôm very meh about my life now and I don‚Äôt want it. Despite this I never gave up trying to find a new doctor. I found one! I go tomorrow. Honestly though.. I don‚Äôt want to go back on them. I‚Äôm scared to and I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm terrified of the medical expenses for sure but it‚Äôs more than that. I feel like I imagined them helping me. What if I can‚Äôt afford it, or lose my insurance. I don‚Äôt want to go through withdrawal again and I don‚Äôt want to live like this. Hell, I‚Äôm not living. 

I just wanted to get this out of me because I‚Äôm so so lonely and I‚Äôm so unhappy and I just.. I‚Äôm scared and I can‚Äôt figure out why. ",05Apr2019,5

i tried to kill myself last week, it didn‚Äôt work at all. and i haven‚Äôt really thought about it since that day. it‚Äôs happened before. the thing is there really isn‚Äôt a LOT wrong with my life and i live a pretty relatively good life. i get good-ish grades in a great canadian university. i have friends and i work part time. i just feel like something is so wrong. i don‚Äôt feel real like at any second i might lose all of myself and whatever is driving me to maintain all these parts of life (social life, work/school) might just take over and i will simply be like a robot for lack of better words.. i‚Äôm so lost i don‚Äôt know what this is ",05Apr2019,1

42," Once when I was around 16 I was watching the pastor‚Äôs kid and we found an electric fence and somehow I convinced him to see if it was on. I lifted him up but his mom caught us right before he could touch it, and she freaked out, asking me why I thought it was okay and what I was thinking. I didn‚Äôt really have an answer for her because the truth was I was just curious as to if the power was on, didn‚Äôt even think about what would have happened if he had been hurt, nor did I really care. I would have just been worried that I‚Äôd get in trouble for the act, not actually caring about the act itself.

43,"I'm always trying so, so hard to cheer others up, to be positive, to not burden others. But I'm just so on edge. My fianc√© is very interested in a friend of him, a girl who is going to his university classes and it hurts so bad, especially since I was making a big effort to better our relationship.

I've done that, but I had the gut feeling that there was something going on and she was the only person I was jealous over for some reason. Now I know why.. Nothing ever happened between them, she doesn't even know it. She is in a relationship as well. I took his confession very well, basically said that he is not to blame for his feelings and that I am glad he finally said it.

There was a similar situation and since then we worked on our relationship. I left for the weekend to go to my dad's, so we both could figure out what we want and feel. Thank God I have friends who are there for me.

I think he's running from his problems with all of this and he's searching for new stimuli to repress bad things in his life and his past. He has to start taking care of himself and of our relationship. Although he is there for me, but I feel like he doesn't invest as much as I do. I feel so ungrateful for saying that and a voice in my head keeps telling me I'm just never enough and nobody's ever gonna love or care about me.

I feel so bad for him because he is so alone at home. I am afraid he sees how much better he is doing without. I am afraid of being alone, but I also really love and care about him. I am dependent, if I'm being honest, and that scares me as well. 

I just want him to hold me, to love me and to say that everything is going to be okay. I want to hug him. It's all a mess and I feel like I'm literally dying inside.",05Apr2019,3

45,"I'm not really sure how to articulate this so bear with me. I recently had to come back to my country of origin (I've lived somewhere else for the past 2+ years) due to needing to be here for a sick family member. I struggled a lot with anxiety and depression in the past when I lived here, but these problems largely resolved themselves after I left and found a lifestyle outside of my home country that seemed to evaporate those problems. After only a few months of leaving I found that I no longer needed medication, and for the first time in my adult life I was happy and comfortable with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday, having been back in my home country for about a week, the intense feeling of anxiety is starting to creep back into my life, except now it's even more intense than it ever was. Two days in a row now I've been experiencing intense panic attacks and episodes of dissociation. I'll be sitting around doing normal stuff when suddenly I get this feeling of unease mixed with... I don't know.. something. This feeling \*almost\* feels good, but not really, I can't really explain it. Then after a few minutes the dissociation starts and I feel like I'm not real, like nothing around me is real, and reality itself is fluid and arbitrary. This lasts for maybe an hour, during which I can't do much other than lie paralyzed in my bed, trying to control my breathing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I'm expecting from posting here, other than perhaps getting an outlet and writing my feelings down. The only solution I can come up with is to tough it out until I can leave this place again, as I'm fairly sure it's being here that's triggering these episodes.

46,"For context, I (20F)  am moving from the city where I was going to college back home after I was hospitalized. Today was the day my ndad and I went back there to get all of my furniture and my ex boyfriend, whom I still love and care about deeply, came to help. Here‚Äôs what happened next:

I had a mental breakdown bc it was just A Lot‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and my dad almost made me cry today bc he used his stern voice which is just a step down from his yelling voice so I basically reverted back to childhood. Then when O and I were gonna be ~promiscuous~ together after dinner, I had a panic attack, started crying and hyperventilating, and basically relived being assaulted for three hours. Like I wouldn‚Äôt let him touch me except to like hold my waist, touch my face, give me kisses, and play with my hair. I told him about being assaulted, I told him I wanted to die, I told him how much it hurts all the time, I told him how they took a piece of me. I told him it was my fault and explained why it was my fault. I asked him why he didn‚Äôt hate me after all the things I‚Äôd done. I told him I was a bad person. I couldn‚Äôt stop apologizing. There are too many things to apologize for. Once I calmed down he left to go to his apartment, I left to drive home to my city, we said goodbye and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is the last time we‚Äôll see each other‚Äù. Then on the drive back, I almost ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere so I pulled off to an exit to pump gas AND THE PUMPS WERE OFF. So I had to drive about 20 miles, slow as hell to save gas, with my tank nearly empty. Panic attack, hyperventilating, and crying ensued. Like wailing crying. I was so scared. I ended up being okay and getting gas but also cigarettes because honestly I was so shaken that I needed it to calm down. So that‚Äôs like 2.5 weeks wasted but that‚Äôs okay, I made that choice, and now I‚Äôm moving on. And then I get to like within 15 miles of my exit and I start to think about what O said, ‚Äúthis won‚Äôt be the last time we see each other.‚Äù And my brain went, ‚Äúwhat if it is?‚Äù What if I never see him again? What if I never hold him again? The world won‚Äôt end but I‚Äôll be crushed more than the dinosaurs were. So I again started crying. And then I was thinking wow, I feel so bad that O fell in love with someone so emotionally damaged. Let‚Äôs tell him. So I did, I snap chatted it to him, he‚Äôll see it tomorrow. I am a wreck. I didn‚Äôt realize how fucked up I am until I wouldn‚Äôt let the man I love so fucking much touch me. 

But overall, I was able to feel my feelings and come down without medicine. I would‚Äôve taken it if I had it. O wanted to smoke but I was just crying and shaking so he held me, but I definitely would‚Äôve smoked if he had rolled a joint. I am proud of myself for not only opening up, but also setting boundaries when I needed to. ",05Apr2019,2
47,"So I'll preface this with, I am genuinely depressed, but as time has gone on it has gotten more difficult to discern, what is lack of interest, and what is being quashed by a depressive episode.

Right now I'm at a games convention and sharing a room with a good friend who is a games developer herself and very passionate. I'm a games artist and should be really enthralled by a lot of what I am seeing but I'm just not.

I don't know if I am depressed, out of my depth, and it's not even that I feel like I could learn a lot, but that I just shouldn't be there. This is a horrible thing to feel because the industry is very social, and yet my brain goes offline in those spaces.

I need to pick this apart, because right now I don't know if I should be shifting my career plans to something else owing to a lack of interest or motivation to overcome the barriers of this industry, or if I should just ride it out. Those options are preferable to secret option X.

49,"I‚Äôve noticed that when discussing physical health problems, most people are aware that a physical health problem ranges from the common cold through to terminal illness and everything in between.
However, when discussing mental health problems there appears to be an assumption of serious mental illness which automatically calls into question someone‚Äôs risk to others and their capacity to take care of themselves and make decisions. Mental health problems, like physical health problems, has a range from feeling a little flat for a few days to serious mental illness (potentially also terminal). This fuels the stigma and misunderstanding of mental health issues.

Equally, if someone talks of taking care of their physical health by eating well, exercising regularly etc. It seems that it is understood to be a sensible strategy to maintain or improve their health as a preventative measure. But, when talking of taking care of their mental health, it is assumed by some that there is a pre existing mental health condition.
There have been times when someone has said they need to take care of their mental health and the response is ‚Äúoh! I didn‚Äôt know you had a mental health problem‚Äù.

Another terminology issue is the short-hand many people use. When someone says mental health, many people understand that to mean mental health problem. It doesn‚Äôt appear to happen with the same frequency when talking about physical health.

50,"For the past few months, almost every dream I've had has been a nightmare. Nightmares about witnessing suicides first hand and becoming traumatized from it.

Of losing my hair, my teeth, etc.

I don't understand why these nightmares are so persistent and so frequent. I know I am an insecure person, but I didn't think I was so insecure that it would lead to this. I do have depression, and have been taking Prozac for over a month. Maybe this is a side effect? I don't know.

I just don't know what to make of all of this. All I know for certain is that it is distressing me, and I want it to stop. Any input would be great.

51,"I know it usually starts with the assumption that when you seek therapy you actually want to get better, but that doesn't have to be true. I only worry about the consequences for my loved ones if I die. I'm not just depressed, but I don't to live, like, persistently and consistently, but that doesn't seem to be something that people understand. They often think it's an acute crisis thing. I'm not suicidal, because that sounds like fighting urges or fluctuating between feeling. I'm not doing that and I never had intrusive thoughts about it. Honestly, I hate the drama around suicide and I wish it was possible to talk about it in a more relaxed way, even when you're young, pretty, smart, successful, or physically healthy. Humans aren't a piece of meat in a super market shelf where you can say ""oh, it would be a shame to let that go to waste"", we're autonomous individuals and we shouldn't suffer through life for someone's personal pleasure.

I feel like I've done enough. I just want to lean back and let the world go its path without me. If someone ask me if there's a part of me that wants to live, I would say: given the unchangeable circumstances, no. I had a psychologist tell me that I'm abusing myself and that I will kill myself because of it, but I disagree. Being a member of a community requires to make sacrifices regarding your own interests. And sometimes those sacrifices happen to be very painful. I was just born unsuitable for this life. During therapy I figured out that if I had the opposite sex I'd think differently about myself and everything, but that information is completely useless as I can't change the facts of reality (and please I don't want to hear anything else, it's delusional, I'm done with this topic for good, fuck everyone who tries to convince me otherwise and spread false hope, just fuck you).

When people say ""get professional help"" I have no idea what they expect, but from my experience, it's pathetic. I'm not from the US, but the mental hospitals I've seen here are overcrowded, underfunded, dirty, and I have a hard time imagining how they'd help someone, regardless of the illness. The psychiatrists don't give a damn. It seems like they just know some medications only by the brand names, with an outdated understanding of the action mechanisms, and just try it out on patients. Psychologists on the other hand were surprisingly good at analyzing things and telling me what I already knew. Therapist appointments were awkward. They tried to find something positive that they could work with, but when they failed they didn't seem to know what to say anymore. It hurts to know that there's no place where you can go anymore.

At least I know my antidepressants are working because I can pull myself together to get shit done and cope with the pain easier. I'm still going to see my psychiatrist and ask for an increase in medication and try for ECT again. I've been in and out of therapy many times in hope that it would change anything, but it feels like there's no point.",05Apr2019,1

58,"I've been in a Partial Hospitalization Program for my mental health for 2 weeks now (today is the last day of the PHP, I'll be dropping down to IOP next week). My therapist recommended it as she thought the structure would be better suited given my state.

I won't lie, it has been extremely tough. A lot of the groups are regarding things I already know (but haven't been able to incorporate in my life). I found one-on-one therapy once a week to be draining, so having 5 days a week from 9 AM to 3 PM filled with therapy (especially in a group format) has been VERY draining.

Most days I stumble out of there in an absolute emotional/mental daze and only manage to drag myself home with enough energy to try to eat and go to bed immediately. I was getting frustrated as hell, felt like it was all material I knew and that I wasn't really gaining anything from it all (despite trying, I really have been trying).

Apparently though, I have been gaining things - it's just been very small progress and not very apparent to me whatsoever. However last evening I noticed it fully and it smacked me in the face, I was able to have a difficult conversation that old me would likely NEVER do. Not only did I have the conversation, I prepared for it and reached out to initiate the talk. The call came probably 45 mins or so after and I was almost back in my terrified ""I'm going to just avoid it"" state, but I went through it anyway - I used my preparation. I probably could have done a much better job, but fuck that shit - I did it and I am fucking proud of myself for once.

Now that I've had the night to mull it all over, I admit there's a lot of the worry and anxiety that has popped back up. I am trying to quiet those, I did what I could in the moment and I'm totally a newbie at this. I won't learn unless I do, and the truth is regardless of how badly I think it went or if I think I didn't explain something properly - I did it and feel relieved.

The reason I mentioned in the title that it's scary as hell though is  now I've taken these steps, I have to continue this progress. I can't slack off or let the doubt creep back in and take hold. Now that I see a light, some hope I have to fucking pursue that shit with all my being. Which means there will be many more very uncomfortable times and conversations like the one I had to have last evening, and that's kinda scary.

Sorry for the length of this but I needed to share. In the past I've generally always been negative with myself on things. I wanted to take this opportunity to write now as I see some positives. I'm tired of being the beaten down, depressed, negative pessimistic soulless person I have been for many years.

I will be starting a new medication today. I'm a bit scared as most all past experiences didn't go so well. It's the generic for Pristiq. I actually have taken Pristiq before and it helped quite a lot but that was several years ago before there was a generic. I'm worried it won't work or have issues. I worry too much, lol.

**TL;DR** I've been in Partial Hospitalization Program (group therapy, etc.) for going on 10 days now. Felt it was a waste of time/money/energy, but applied myself anyway to being engaged. Made progress despite feeling those things by having a difficult conversation I would have never had as the ""old me"".",05Apr2019,1

60,"*Hello! My name is Sofiya and that‚Äôs my essay on a very controversial topic we really need to talk about. I‚Äôm sorry this post is so long! But I would really appreciate it if you‚Äôll read and spread it, please!* 

**Mental health** is a controversial subject commonly disregarded due to lack of reputable information, yet remains a silent killer of no discrimination to consider. Many believe that mental health is equally as important as physical health, while others claim that its importance is overrated; however, research concludes that the health and well-being of our minds is a serious concern that is taken too lightly. According to the World Health Organization, **1 in 4 people suffer from a psychiatric illness or disorder**. Mental illness can affect one‚Äôs productivity, motivation, and perception, altering their behavior through unpredictable mood swings, indifference, apathy, self-inflicting harm, and also harm inflicted upon others. According to statistics taken from the National Institutes of Health, ***‚Äúevery year over 800,000 people die by suicide and 90% of them have a diagnosable and treatable psychiatric disorder at the time of their death‚Äù***. In my opinion, this is a tragically clear indicator that we don‚Äôt take mental health seriously enough.   
Symptoms of mental disorders are easier to mask than most common illnesses, and are often associated with the social stigma as a danger in society. Ironically, it is suggested that society is more truthfully the danger to those suffering from mental illness. An article published from Christian Mental Health Services states that **‚Äú*****each year, approximately 44 million American adults will experience a serious mental health condition and less than half will seek treatment due to stigma and discrimination*****‚Äù**. Unfortunately, statistics such as this point to the leading cause of a growth in the suicide rate.   
According to research, **suicide is the 10th leading cause of death** in the United States. It is estimated that a staggering **‚Äú44,193 people commit suicide‚Äù, yearly**, with the United States of America taking the **34th** position in the World Health Organization, the world suicide rate for both sexes and all ages (by 2016). My home country of Kazakhstan holds the rank of **7th**, and leads with **the highest number of recorded world suicides among girls, ages 15 to 19**. Words cannot express how deeply this breaks my heart, leaving me to feel helpless to help those in need.   
Society convinces us that it is not necessary for people to talk about their feelings and mental state, especially in foreign countries such as the Asian and Russian cultures. Typically, school bullying and poor family values tend to evade its responsibility, but the true concern is the lack of understanding and empathy. It remains detrimental to the human race to continue neglecting our mental well-being, while stigmatizing psychiatric disorders in fear and shame. **Psychology should be taken very seriously**, especially in concern for those who suffer emotionally.   
I feel that a world-wide enlightenment of such concern can awaken the change that we need to help end so much unnecessary suffering through mental illness. As a future psychology major, I am highly concerned about educating others on the importance of our overall mental well-being. My ultimate goal is to spread mental awareness in my country, lead a campaign against social stigmas and discrimination, open several mental health rehabilitation facilities, and establish recovery homes for teenagers and adults. I want to be that change and provide the availability for others to reach out for help. I want to help make the world a more beautiful place for us all. In a quote taken from American actor, Jeff Bridges, I was reminded that big dreams begin with small ideas: *‚ÄúThe way to change the world is through individual responsibility and taking local action in your own community.‚Äù*  I couldn‚Äôt agree more.

72,"I've had two bad days in the past 2 weeks, yet those bad days didn't turn into multiple bad days in a row. Both were sad reactions to constructive criticism I received from my manager along with a notice of progressive disciplinary action, which they said would give me room to grow. I still felt nervous and queasy about it, but I handled it better than last year, where I was struggling in my job, and took their constructive criticism like a sledgehammer to the gut. This only motivated me to push myself to get good at what I do. It seems all so hard and it mentally hurts to push myself to get good, but I am so determined to do it because I want to fulfill the American dream (a house or apartment, a car, a job, accomplishing amazing tasks). Despite the mental pain, I appear right now to be succeeding at implementing changes.

&amp;#x200B;

I also notice strangely enough as I succeed at nearly everything I push myself to get good at in life, the Internet has places that consistently scream how the world is such a terrible place with flawed economic systems and corrupt people who they consistently claim put their lives over the lives of others. Here's a very popular example. On November 9, 2016, the very day Trump got elected president and the Internet was screaming bloody murder over how bad this was, I get a message from The Home Depot inviting me to Interview Day. I attended the interview, and that same evening, ended up getting a job as Software Engineer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another example of me succeeding, the Internet complaining, is when I received several merit badges at work for going above and beyond the call of duty and a bonus while the Internet was freaking out over a wildfire in California, or whatever tweeting that our President does. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, there is recovering from bad days and learning to stay calm on my end, adapting well to new changes at work (a new office), while some politicians in Washington who get a bunch of press complain about how they believe that capitalism is such a terrible system. It's their belief, and I'll let them speak. As an American, I stand for all free speech.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe a very good reason for some of my mental setbacks that could be contributing to behavior that is not calm or serene is because I let the news media get to me too often. They screamed about how the drought in California was never-ending. It just ended. They scream sometimes how they think all white people are bad. I look at myself, I'm white, but I often push myself have the content of my character to be the best it can me. Finally, in the film business, they scream about how Fox is dead under Disney. They lied. Because unlike Blockbuster, which actually did die, Fox now exists as a successful subsidiary to the Walt Disney Studios. Upcoming films include the Fear Street trilogy and a remake of West Side Story. Disney was afraid of Netflix. Netflix is cranking out so much stuff. Other companies are making streaming services. Some people are even crowdfunding streaming services. There exists white label solutions for streaming services. I would love to make my own streaming service, too. As Mom tells me, a lot of these statements is a bunch of hot air that is not determined unless it really happens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to let the press get to me anymore. That's why I want to push myself to get good while I ignore all the junky stuff around me. There's no reason for me to worry about all this outside stuff if my life is going good right now and I'm succeeding under stress to become slowly but surely the software engineer that these people want me to be.",05Apr2019,1

For the context: I  had a surgery recently and can‚Äôt move very freely. 


So this happened just few minutes ago in a public bus. I was sitting by my own when a middle aged woman came. There was a seat next to me, so I suggested she take it and continued listening to music.  Next another woman next to me hit me and said I should move on so that the woman can sit. I did that through a lot of pain, and said that I couldn‚Äôt do it because of my situation. Next the middle aged(35 max I guess, no disabilities) starts yelling and cursing me for not giving the spit earlier. She starts: how should‚Äôve I moved there, you‚Äôre just fat so you should‚Äôve moved earlier. I said it was not for her to decide and she started cursing my parents and my family for raising me like this. Then she hit me. Everyone in the bus was agreeing with her and how younger generation has no respect and boundaries. Then she blamed me for hitting her with my bag and said just leave. And other passengers just cursed me, so I ran away almost crying. 

I would like to say that people say that I am the nicest person and always rely on me both in my workplace and school. I have depression but nobody else knows about it so I can not talk to anyone about this. I have a wonderful family but. I hate the country I live in,  and I hate the society for shit like this.

Genuine question because in the past few years, something has happened that made me realize that I actually might be a sociopath. I‚Äôm going to try my best to keep this short since I‚Äôm not very articulate. When I was a child (around kindergarten to the end of middle school) I used to start a lot of fights.  I don't anymore because I've gotten better at putting on this mask I seem to have in front of people.  It would be the smallest things that ticked me off like one time this girl accidentally threw a paper airplane at my desk in class and for some reason, I got so angry that afterward, I was hitting her by the lockers, this was during middle school. Someone else was trying to stop me but for some reason, I couldn‚Äôt. I got in trouble for it and I remember having to act like I was sorry and pretend to regret it even though I felt 0 remorse. 

When someone close got sick or passed away I could never figure out why it didn‚Äôt bother me. Anyways that was the kind of stuff that would happen quite a lot growing up. But what really got me worried was the fact that when my father died a few years ago and my mother told me the news. I was surprised but didn‚Äôt actually feel heartbroken about it at all. When I was at his funeral, everyone was upset and especially my mum so I figured I had to act like I was as well because then it would‚Äôve looked bad if I wasn‚Äôt. That was when I walked over to her and cried in her arms. When people ask me how I was doing after his death, I always had to lie and go on about how I can‚Äôt seem to move on and how much I missed him. Even though I know that we're all better off without him. 

Thing is, he was my father and although he wasn‚Äôt a great person, I keep thinking that I should be more upset about what happened. So I wonder if maybe I‚Äôm a sociopath? Or whether it‚Äôs possible that it could be a spectrum? ",05Apr2019,2

80,"It started when I was about 9. I could‚Äôve been a year older or younger but it is all a blur. 

I came into the kitchen to my mum in tears. She didn‚Äôt want to tell me what had happened but after my spiel about being old enough to know she finally told me. My cousin had killed herself. Jumped off a 9 story car park. I think it was right then that my bubble burst. 
You could argue that my mum should‚Äôve know better but everybody makes mistakes. Who can honestly say they know how their child is going to take some information like that. I asked her to tell me and she did. That‚Äôs it. 
The thought of someone so close doing something like that was too much to comprehend for my young mind. My innocence was gone. I‚Äôm not sure if I ever even met her but the memory is carved into my mind forever. Hearing of suicide makes me so upset now that I usually bury it. I hate talking about it. It has affected many of the decisions I‚Äôve made over the years, mostly in regards to drugs but also with how I deal with people who take them. I have cut and run from friends several times to save myself from watching someone else do the same thing to themselves. They needed me. I just wasn‚Äôt strong enough. 

Everything is easier with hindsight.

Then came secondary school. I was timid and introverted. Smart enough to get through it but not so much that I actually tried to achieve anything with it. Being told I was special fed my ego to a point that it controlled me. I thought I was smarter than everyone. The teachers. My parents. My friends. My enemies. The frustration with people drove me insane, I felt like everyone was asleep and needed someone like me to shake them awake again. I felt like I didn‚Äôt need to try, like something was owed to me. 
Eventually I began to hate myself for the thoughts I was having, consumed by anger and sadness. I want to be a good person but there is an ugly, bitter side to me that is anything but. The ego that told me I‚Äôm better than people was actually achieving the opposite, forming grudges and hatred for things I didn‚Äôt understand. 

I think about going back and telling my younger self to cut the bullshit. Buck your ideas up. When adults told me I‚Äôd regret it later I just assumed they made mistakes that I wouldn‚Äôt. I was better than them after all. Whatever life threw at me I could handle it. It almost makes me laugh when I think about how wrong I was, but it also hurts. A lot. Sometimes I feel like I was lied to but when my rational side kicks in I know that it was nobody‚Äôs fault but my own. My reaction was the problem, not the situation. I guess I just had to learn the hard way like most people do.

We‚Äôre all in the same boat.

I was bullied, another memory I tend to bury. My ego prefers the narrative of a mouthy, rebellious kid who wouldn‚Äôt take shit from anyone. In reality I was very different. I was quiet and scared, even with all my friends around me I still felt alone. That feeling in the pit of your stomach that something isn‚Äôt right. I get that constantly. There are so many reasons to be sad or happy within an arms reach, but happiness felt like it was an ocean away. Honestly it still does sometimes. 

I was 21 when the headaches started. I know that for sure because I was in so much pain I literally thought I was going to die. I made a decision then that if I was going to, I‚Äôd rather be at home than in a hospital bed. That was the first time I ever considered ending it. 
Doctors weren‚Äôt helpful, telling me I just needed to get on with it and get back to work. Nobody seemed to take me seriously. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone does now to be honest. 
I am in pain all day, every day. I don‚Äôt get a break, my headaches don‚Äôt take days off. Which means I don‚Äôt either. It‚Äôs not just my head but my body as well, everything hurts. Physically and mentally I have been broken down over the last 8 years, and nobody seems to understand. I have no diagnosis and no treatment besides weed and alcohol, substances that I have grown to hate over the years and yet still, every evening, I light a spliff and drink my beer. It makes me feel weak but I have nothing else, they are the only painkillers I have.

I battle with my mind and body every day. Many days I win, many days I don‚Äôt. Whenever a new situation happens, there is a scramble on both sides to fight over who takes control. The optimistic side to me that knows it will turn out ok in the end. The side that rationalises things and puts it into the perspective my friends and family try to make me see. Then there is the side that has had enough. The side that is sick to death of feeling pain and suffering and feels like there will never be an end to it. The side that doesn‚Äôt think about a solution, just an escape route. 
Do I let that side win? Yes, that‚Äôs a way to put it I suppose. Maybe I don‚Äôt have as much control as I think. Maybe I do and I don‚Äôt put up enough fight. Either way I am exhausted. I‚Äôve felt so emotional for so long that whatever I do, it hurts. 

I often wonder about life lessons and when we learn them. A lot of times it feels too late but then I remind myself that we all have to go through the same things. People telling you something is never the same as experiencing it. The key thing I try to remember is that it makes me stronger, but a lot of the time I don‚Äôt feel strong at all. I‚Äôve proven to myself that I am and I still don‚Äôt believe it. 

This is what I am going through right now, my girlfriend of 9 months has just broken up with me. I thought I was in a happy relationship and for the first time ever, I felt content. We argued occasionally but never anything serious. I came to find out that she wasn‚Äôt as mature as I thought, burying a lot of conversations that would have saved the relationship had she actually communicated her problems to me. At least one side of me thinks that, the other side knows that she doesn‚Äôt love me any more and if she did she would be fighting for it. That‚Äôs my idea of love anyway, something you‚Äôre prepared to fight for over anything else. I think I have only felt it twice in my entire life and they were several years apart. So I am constantly wondering if I will ever find it again. It seems so illusive, something that ‚Äònormal‚Äô people can have quite easily but for someone like me, it feels like I‚Äôm looking for a needle in a haystack that I can‚Äôt even see. 

So she moved her stuff out and I am alone. Again. And you know what I realised for the umpteenth time? I need people. I need somebody to speak to, to vent. To tell me that I‚Äôm going to be ok. Without them I‚Äôd be in the darkest hole I‚Äôve ever been in, the last positive bits of my mind left to rot.

My friends and my family are the reason I‚Äôm still breathing and I fucking love you lot. Thank you.

A year ago I saw a counselor and talked through job stress, general family life, and faith issues. I also took anti-depressants for a few months. Overall, things looked up and I went off the meds. With some clearer hindsight now, I can track a clear relationship between suicidal ideation and sexual frustration. If we haven't had sex in a few weeks I start to feel worthless and somehow as a coping mechanism my mind will start thinking of ways I could end everything. I can trace these thought patterns back to being a teenager with guilt and feelings of worthlessness because of masturbation and what my religion taught.

Today I got funding again! Today was also the first time I ever burst Into tears of happiness, I never knew how that felt. As soon as I found out, I cant explain it well, but it was like a weight lifted from me, a weight I didn't know was there. Like I suddenly felt something other than numbness.

I really just wanted to tell somebody. I still have a long way to go, but it feels like I can get there now.

107,"Or at least, whatever amount of social anxiety I still have, Reddit boosts it. I get a lot of great or helpful comments when I ask a question or say something, and a lot of people are great. But it seems like sometimes no matter what I say or intend, I get downvotes or rude, snarky, unhelpful comments. 

This brings back unpleasant memories of times when my social anxiety was at its peak, my sense of self practically didn't exist because everything I said or did was made fun or ignored. The peak of this was during a time in grade/middle school, and when I was 18/19. Regarding the latter, I had practically no friends at college, people treated me like a joke, I felt so much pressure to ""present well"" (hair, clothes, makeup) to ""make up"" for being such a terrible person. 

Anyway, when this happens on Reddit it brings up these unpleasant memories. I guess this is just a rant of sorts. I'd love to hear if others have had self-esteem or anxiety issues due to Reddit. Just another reason I feel better mentally when I'm not on social media.",05Apr2019,5

120,"Hi everyone,

So my 2019 has been shit. I was coming off one of the best years of my life, I had a job, I had started my masters, I was competing with one of my university sports teams and I was with my girlfriend who I had been with for two and a half years. Each day I was becoming more and more confident in myself following seven years of bullying at secondary school and I was starting to become myself again. All of this came crashing down within one week. First, it was my masters, the grades I received were considerably lower than expected and barely a pass. Then it was my job, I was told that they weren't able to keep me on anymore. After that, my team told me that we weren't competing this year and so I was effectively training for nothing. Finally, my girlfriend, who knew all of this, broke up with me. The worst part is that being a British student, I have signed a tenancy agreement with her that binds us to a shared flat until August. 

She wasn't kind when she broke up with me, she did it via e-mail despite her insisting that it was a letter delivered via e-mail (She sent a document as an attachment). I replied with my feelings against the break-up and she sent a reply. Both of these e-mails listed my flaws as both a person and a boyfriend; talks of emotional abuse and emotionally cheating on her. I was so devastated that I left university for two and a half weeks to try and get over her. In that time she told me that she never wants to see me again and that I was a leech on her emotions. The worst thing she told me was ""I deserve so much better than you"".

Despite how long we were together, it didn't take me too long to find someone else. I reconnected with a lost love and we began dating and have now formed a relationship together and it's going great. We have a lot in common and she seems to enjoy the parts of me that my ex disliked. I have learned from the mistakes of my past relationship. However, there are a few things that make me feel uncertain about it. The first one is that sometimes she seems disconnected or uninterested in me or what I am saying and I worry that I bore her. I have been told by people in the past that I talk far too much or people have given me the impression that I am a generally uninteresting and unfunny person.

The second is the words that my ex told me. ""I deserve so much better than you"". If someone that has the nerve to tell someone that believes they do and will tell them that when they are in such a vulnerable space then surely there must be some truth to it. My current girlfriend means so much to me but this has made me feel like I am not good enough for her and I worry that she will realise it. 

Besides this, I have since found a job that I enjoy, I've started to get back into training despite it often being a struggle to get out of bed or even into the shower. The only missing piece is my motivation, I find it hard to motivate myself to do anything anymore and it. Some days I struggle to get out of bed for hours and when I find the motivation to get out of bed I normally sit on the bathroom floor with the shower running for about an hour. It feels like a physical chore to be happy and smile. 

Even today my ex came into the lounge where I had my music on (Music is one of the only things that helps me currently) and told me to ""turn it down to a respectable volume"". I turned it off immediately and apologised and then she turned it around on me and told me that I was the one having a go at her. I'm honestly just sick and tired of constantly being told what is best for me or that I am not good enough. I feel worthless, I feel walked over constantly even though I try and stand up for myself. I have a strong desire to change the world no matter how little it is, so long as I make an aspect of it better for others and it constantly feels like the world is telling me that it doesn't want my input. I feel like if I was to die tomorrow, sure people would mourn, but it wouldn't affect the world one way or the other. Sometimes I just want to get in my car and drive as far away as I can and even then it's not far enough. I'm just finding it hard to be happy and harder yet to find fulfilment in life.

130,"I'm currently 15 female, turning 16 on April 8.

Before I get into this, I'd struggled with suicidal thoughts, self harm, attempts of suicide, and prolonged sadness and gloominess for around 8 years before this situation. It had dialed down for a year or so before this as well. ""ended"" at the start of 2017 (January).

Sorry this is long. 

Last year from mid May to late July/Early August I was extremely extroverted and energized. I was frequently inspired, taking initiative, didn't need more than 2 hours of sleep a night to still be energized, felt like I was on top of the world all the time, honestly.. I felt like the world was amazing and beautiful and I simply was just incredibly happy. 

There were rare random weeks during these euphoric months that I felt utterly empty and constantly sad though, but then it'd be away and I'd be back to feeling like I was high, almost, and I'd be really hyper, etc. I liked who I was back then, nonetheless. I loved socializing and I would drop everything I was doing to run upstairs and call my friend(s), etc. It was amazing to say the least (excluding my down weeks but the up weeks made up for it and overall I felt super happy). 

Before April, I had been overcoming a wave of despair. It started in mid-to-late November of 2017 and I was constantly tired, sleeping 10-12 hours over the weekend, but during the weekdays I usually could not get more than 2 hours of sleep a night as I'd wake up in increments of 10-30 minutes after falling asleep and take a while to fall asleep (only to wake up soon after as I described). I wore the same clothes to school everyday and spent most of my day pulling my hair out, which, along with my face and the rest of my body, was very much greasy and my hair releasing a musty smell, even I could tell, but my peers often pointed it out. I didn't have enough energy to really do anything. I probably didn't shower for a few months, or several weeks. I didn't try in school so my grades were not up to their potential (had all A's and one B though). I cried nearly every night and would rest my head on my desk or close my eyes on the bus rides to and from school.

Once May of 2018 came around, I began to experience that energized happiness I previously described. In August of 2018, it went away and it only worsened as each day went by. in As of February, I'd become more introverted and prefer to finish a YouTube video over talking to a friend immediately. I feel as though I've lost myself and who I was. I feel tired most of the time and have been doing horribly in school, bouncing between Cs and Bs in a couple of classes as I cannot get myself to do any work, or I will procrastinate and lead to myself receiving an hour or so of sleep from working on an assignment too late. I used to start projects the second I got home.. I've also been experiencing what I believe to be anxiety but I'm not entirely sure because I've never endured such things before and I'm not trying to self-diagnose anything but I panic often. This happened today, too, simply because I am supposed to engage in a group call tomorrow morning (which was my idea, so it's stupid of me to be panicking) but anyway, when I start to panic (some worse than others, my first panic being in October) I cannot breathe/struggle to breathe, my chest pounds quickly and feels as though it is being clenched, I start sweating, my head pounds, I feel dizzy, may struggle to walk, and my face gets really hot, etc. I think about suicide most days, every day, rather, but this certainly wasn't as bad as those years prior to 2016. 

This feeling low has heavily affected me in all areas of my life and I spoke to my school counselor (the first time I've sought help from a counselor or anything) a few weeks ago to which she got my into a support group on campus, so I should hopefully be getting better, but it just seems that I cannot escape this cycle of feeling terrible for several months and then happy for another few months and down again. Occasionally in the middle of these few months there will be a week or 2 of feeling down again it feeling good again. It's weird because it had been pretty much constant sadness for the majority of my life and then it randomly began to alter. 

I asked my friends what they thought (4 of which have all been diagnosed with clinical depression themselves) and they all believe I match bipolar disorder. I looked up the symptoms and I match all of them except like usage of drugs or drinking of course, but I have had times where my up weeks or months got me in trouble. 

They recommended I take online quizzes just to get a general idea of what I MIGHT have (not use as a diagnosis) and I scored most likely bipolar disorder each time. I took around 20 different tests several times throughout the past 2 months

I am incapable of receiving a diagnosis or treatment because my parents are 100% completely against the idea and refuse to allow me to seek any mental help.

So now I am not allowed to go to group anymore at all and have limited ways of reaching out for help now.

131,"I'm currently 15 female, turning 16 on April 8.

Before I get into this, I'd struggled with suicidal thoughts, self harm, attempts of suicide, and prolonged sadness and gloominess for around 8 years before this situation. It had dialed down for a year or so before this as well. ""ended"" at the start of 2017 (January).

Sorry this is long. 

Last year from mid May to late July/Early August I was extremely extroverted and energized. I was frequently inspired, taking initiative, didn't need more than 2 hours of sleep a night to still be energized, felt like I was on top of the world all the time, honestly.. I felt like the world was amazing and beautiful and I simply was just incredibly happy. 

There were rare random weeks during these euphoric months that I felt utterly empty and constantly sad though, but then it'd be away and I'd be back to feeling like I was high, almost, and I'd be really hyper, etc. I liked who I was back then, nonetheless. I loved socializing and I would drop everything I was doing to run upstairs and call my friend(s), etc. It was amazing to say the least (excluding my down weeks but the up weeks made up for it and overall I felt super happy). 

Before April, I had been overcoming a wave of despair. It started in mid-to-late November of 2017 and I was constantly tired, sleeping 10-12 hours over the weekend, but during the weekdays I usually could not get more than 2 hours of sleep a night as I'd wake up in increments of 10-30 minutes after falling asleep and take a while to fall asleep (only to wake up soon after as I described). I wore the same clothes to school everyday and spent most of my day pulling my hair out, which, along with my face and the rest of my body, was very much greasy and my hair releasing a musty smell, even I could tell, but my peers often pointed it out. I didn't have enough energy to really do anything. I probably didn't shower for a few months, or several weeks. I didn't try in school so my grades were not up to their potential (had all A's and one B though). I cried nearly every night and would rest my head on my desk or close my eyes on the bus rides to and from school.

Once May of 2018 came around, I began to experience that energized happiness I previously described. In August of 2018, it went away and it only worsened as each day went by. in As of February, I'd become more introverted and prefer to finish a YouTube video over talking to a friend immediately. I feel as though I've lost myself and who I was. I feel tired most of the time and have been doing horribly in school, bouncing between Cs and Bs in a couple of classes as I cannot get myself to do any work, or I will procrastinate and lead to myself receiving an hour or so of sleep from working on an assignment too late. I used to start projects the second I got home.. I've also been experiencing what I believe to be anxiety but I'm not entirely sure because I've never endured such things before and I'm not trying to self-diagnose anything but I panic often. This happened today, too, simply because I am supposed to engage in a group call tomorrow morning (which was my idea, so it's stupid of me to be panicking) but anyway, when I start to panic (some worse than others, my first panic being in October) I cannot breathe/struggle to breathe, my chest pounds quickly and feels as though it is being clenched, I start sweating, my head pounds, I feel dizzy, may struggle to walk, and my face gets really hot, etc. I think about suicide most days, every day, rather, but this certainly wasn't as bad as those years prior to 2016. 

This feeling low has heavily affected me in all areas of my life and I spoke to my school counselor (the first time I've sought help from a counselor or anything) a few weeks ago to which she got my into a support group on campus, so I should hopefully be getting better, but it just seems that I cannot escape this cycle of feeling terrible for several months and then happy for another few months and down again. Occasionally in the middle of these few months there will be a week or 2 of feeling down again it feeling good again. It's weird because it had been pretty much constant sadness for the majority of my life and then it randomly began to alter. 

I asked my friends what they thought (4 of which have all been diagnosed with clinical depression themselves) and they all believe I match bipolar disorder. I looked up the symptoms and I match all of them except like usage of drugs or drinking of course, but I have had times where my up weeks or months got me in trouble. 

They recommended I take online quizzes just to get a general idea of what I MIGHT have (not use as a diagnosis) and I scored most likely bipolar disorder each time. I took around 20 different tests several times throughout the past 2 months

I am incapable of receiving a diagnosis or treatment because my parents are 100% completely against the idea and refuse to allow me to seek any mental help.

 I'd started going to a support group at my school to which my parents found out (because the school marked my absent for classes that group took place during and calls home were made) and I finally decided to pull myself together and confess what had been going on to my mother but she only got angry and started yelling at me and accusing me of talking trash about the family to the group (basically saying im skipping class to go to group for the sole purpose of gossiping about my own family) and calling me out for how supposedly ungrateful I am for all the stuff they buy me and for feeding me and giving me a house to live in.

132,"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to gain anything out of writing on here, but I just need to get some things off my chest.
I was diagnosed with PTSD 12 years ago and Depression and Anxiety, 2 years ago. I‚Äôm a second year nursing student. 
For the past couple of weeks I‚Äôve been feeling down and not wanting to socialise with anybody and keeping my distance from people.
Basically, I‚Äôm also an ex-smoker (quit just over a month ago), but I vape. I was in lecture and we were going on a break. 3 of my friends ran off to go outside and smoke and 2 of them were lagging behind. One of the girl‚Äôs turns to the other and says are you coming *Angela and completely left me out. 
Since then I‚Äôve been distancing myself from them because I just feel I‚Äôm not wanted.
I also work in the local ED and have been speaking to one of my colleagues there. There was a social event tonight and he kept telling me he wasn‚Äôt going. I wasn‚Äôt going anyway because I have no money and my anxiety at the moment is stopping me from going out and socialising. Turns out he did go as he posted a video on social media. I‚Äôm not mad that he went,  I‚Äôm just angry that he lied to me and said he was going away on holiday. Did he lie to me because he thought I wouldn‚Äôt go because he wasn‚Äôt and he was trying to stop me from going?
I know I sound so paranoid. But I just feel like a lot of people are out to get me and hurt my feelings. I don‚Äôt know, just needed to get it off my chest and see if anyone else has experienced this..

I am having a hard time getting through days lately some days I am so happy and a go getter lots of confidence then all of a sudden depression or anger or anxiety will hit me like a ton of bricks and all I want to do is go home and then that will continue for idk how long until I wake up happy again. 

It‚Äôs really hard to find balance in life I know I have depression and anxiety but I am afraid to tell my psychiatrist about my mood swings bc I‚Äôm afraid of what she might say or if she will switch my medicine. I hate switching medicine. I guess my question is has anyone found any copping mechanism to help balance you out ? I can‚Äôt stand it it‚Äôs always up or down. Never stable ",05Apr2019,4
134,"Hi there.
Hopefully this is the right place to post. Huuuuuge TW  for the following post.

I‚Äôve been dealing with severe depression for 3 years, and anxiety and ptsd for about 10 years (since I was 5 ish). I used to self harm in my first year of depression, but my parents found out and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it again because the look on their face was devastating. Now I just shovel food in my face, lock myself away from everyone, skip class and stay awake all night.

I know I‚Äôm on the verge from relapsing. I just want to end it all. I won‚Äôt go into the details but I really, really, really want to commit suicide. However, I can‚Äôt afford to leave my school for a mental health stay in a hospital. I‚Äôm already so behind on my work due to my skipping related to anxiety and everything. I want to be a psychologist or a lawyer when I‚Äôm older. I have the grades for them. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to keep up with them due to my leave. I have a friend that went too. She‚Äôs retaking the whole year because she missed too much. I can‚Äôt afford to do that. We have 2 months left. I don‚Äôt know if I can survive them. 

I‚Äôm really torn on what I should do. Any advice or outside opinion would be so so appreciated. Sorry if this is a jumbled mess. I‚Äôm pretty tired.",05Apr2019,1

137,"Today is one of the saddest days of my life and I decided to come here to share my experience because writing really helps me a lot dealing with my problems but I have no one to read it and I know people here care about mental health problems.
I have anxiety &amp; depression since I was 15. I started taking pills that started on some anxiolytics to antidepressants. I‚Äôm 27 now and I still take those pills every single day, twice a day...
September last year I had a really bad bike accident that resulted in a broken knee. I had 3 surgeries and 3 months in the hospital just recovering from the surgeries and doing some rehab. That accident changed my life forever because I won‚Äôt be able to work on something that demands some strength to do like warehouses and that was my main jobs. I also will never recover 100% from it. It‚Äôs March and I can‚Äôt even walk alone without any help or stand up more than 10min because it hurts so much...

But this is really hard because I got a new girlfriend and I see her work so hard to pay the bills and I fell really useless because I don‚Äôt earn any money and it‚Äôs really hard to find a job that I can do like something online or a place where I can be sit. I fell like she deserves so much more than me because she is very ambitious and wants to travel a lot and do things. I can‚Äôt even get on a plane because of my panic attacks...

138,"Journaling has done so much for me, here are just a few reasons why it's the best. (I hope you can tell I put a lot of work into this so I really appreciate you reading! &lt;3 )

* **To Remember.** I tend to forget a lot and it worsens my anxiety. It really bothers me when I can't remember a particular day that something happened, etc. It immediately resolves the issue when I can look back through my journal and see what I ate, how I was feeling, and what I was doing on a particular day (sometimes I don't do it everyday but I try to summarize whatever I can the next time I do it. 
* **To Make the Most of Therapy.** Particularly if you use a rating system or color-coding system for moods, and mark important thoughts you'd like to address later. Idk about you, but I usually feel happy when I go to therapy, and totally blank out on the dark and depressing thoughts that led to suicidal ideation (which are the things I should really be airing out in therapy). It also gives you an opportunity to see if there are patterns in your changes of mood, and monitor the effects of medication.
* **To Reframe the Day.** Sometimes I get to the end of the day and I feel like sh\*t. Like I wasted the day and life is terrible and I don't even want to wake up ever again. Amazingly, I can usually manage to turn this around at least a little bit by journaling. I start by airing out my grievances, then listing anything I did that day even if it's as small as bathing or talking to someone. I can't tell you how many times I've written ""I guess I did more than I thought"". Then I try to be grateful for at least 2 things about the day, and by that point I have significantly calmed down enough to sleep.
* **As a Reference for Job Applications (and the like):** This is actually what pushed me to make this post. I started journaling in 2017. I have done it at least every few days since then and my god am I grateful for that while I sit here applying for jobs. I didn't do a great job documenting my start and end dates for school and various jobs I've worked at. I had an approximate date but a few of those were actually off by an entire month, and looking back through I was able to get exact dates it was such a relief. I panicked when I saw the application required an actual day instead of just month/year and I'm applying for serious gigs here so I really wanted to be accurate. 
* **As a Creative Outlet:** Journaling doesn't have to just be about writing what happened that day. You can write down ideas; creative ideas, ideas for your future. You can even draw! You can write snippets of stories or document nice quotes you found. It's nice to have all of that in one place.

While you can totally do this on your devices (especially if it really has to be kept locked away) I recommend writing by hand if you can. It's a pretty good stress relief and I find it's a good way to keep up my actual physical writing ability since getting out of school. 

If you find it overwhelming, just do what works for you. Take a piece of grid paper and color-code 1 square for 1 day and then you have a nice colorful page of all of your moods over the month/year/whatever. Or keep a goal of just writing 1 sentence. This will often turn into more, but just set out to write 1 so you don't overwhelm yourself, this isn't meant to be something to stress about. 

I hope I have convinced you to do it, it's really so good for you. Let me know if you have any questions about my experience or if this has inspired you to start journaling (or journaling again), I would love to hear it. Stay strong friends you got this! xoxo",05Apr2019,18
139,"Hello all,

Not sure this belongs here. Self diagnosed with OCD/DPDR and anxiety.

I'm having a hard time figuring out if I have any sociopathic tendencies.

I look at my past alot. And wonder why the Fuck i did certain things especially as a kid.

Examples:

I believe I was sexually molested at a young age. But cant remember much.

I coerced a friend to give me a BJ at age 8.

I threw my cat in the air once, and I think I liked it around age 8.

I had a gambling problem for about 3 yrs.

I was paranoid before with my ex wife cause I thought she was cheating on me.

I have a hard time with relationships. I always feel out of place or I'm wearing a mask or something.

These are just some examples. But all of these examples I feel massive amounts of fear, shame and regret about.

At this stage in my life I obsess on weather I have sociopathy or not. And ita relentless. I just get this dark feeling once in awhile with intrusive thoughts. And my mind spirals out of control. I'm just terrified I might not have OCD but instead have something else like sociopathy......No Offense.
