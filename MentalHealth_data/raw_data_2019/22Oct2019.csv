1,"Since leaving school my social life and mental health has gone down hill at a scary rate. I constantly feel really down and sad about how my life is going , I feel like I'm turning out worse then I should have.
At my worst I feel like there's virtually nothing that makes me happy anymore. 

I've picked up new passions and done alot of reading about how to improve mental health , but at the end of the day I'm always lying in bed until the morning thinking about how bad my life has become in the last couple if months. I just can't get rid of this  constant feeling of how I'm a lesser version of myself and that I have fucked my young adult years. I talk to friends regularly about my problems , but I now begin to feel even worse because I'm now  'that guy' who is constantly depressed. 

Working out is the only thing temporary makes me forget about how I feel , but afterwards when I'm alone I just feel pure shit.

Can anyone relate?",22Oct2019,6
2,"On friday I went to the doctors with my mum (where she got her perscription and) I saw  the doctor about how I feel. I explained everything, about how Id been feeling suicidal, lonely, depressed, that I feel the need to cut almost every night. The appointment felt really awkward and Im still to tell my boyfriend that I got told I need medication for whatever it is I may have. I refused the offer as at the time I didnt know I could take medication. 

I stole some of my mums antidepressant on saturday night not having any idea what they were for until tonight (monday) I took about 5 within an hour, and as the night went on I didnt feel tired like it said I most likely would as a side effect. Since saturday night Ive been extremely tired with small minor headaches every now and then. It hasnt helped with how I feel, infact I feel worse than I did, but that may be because I havent given them a chance, or because Ive mixed them with alcohol. 

I stole a couple more last night, again not feeling anything but sadness, infact my mood had dropped alot more and I hoped I wouldnt wakeup this morning. I stole about 9 more antidepressants tonight, and some other type of pill which I have no idea what it is. 
I feel the need to keep taking these pills, even if it doesnt help my mood, Im hoping if I keep takkng them, one day Ill take enough to not wakeup the next day.",22Oct2019,7
3,"Using a throwaway for this, not even sure if this is the right subreddit but I honestly couldn't find anywhere else to go.  (If this is the wrong place please direct me to the correct location and I can remove this post :-))  
Kinda sad that I've resorted to reddit, I have a few good friends who I know support me and know about this but they have enough going on and I'd rather not burden them

Anyway here goes

Basically I was sexually harassed at work by two male coworkers back in August and it's continued to take a toll on me now.  It's started to affect my mental health and I'm worried if I get too caught up my school work will start to suffer as well (I'm a freshman in college.)  
I'm wary about the school's resources but am continuing to look into them.  My main concern is my family being notified.  I feel shame when I think about what happened to me and I don't want my family learning about this and feeling even more shameful.  I know what happened to me wasn't, couldn't have been, my fault, but it's still gross and wrong and I feel sick.

Today a classmate sat down next to me with a monster energy drink.  One of my harassers always drank monster and the smell of it made me dizzy.

That's basically it.  I'm trying to keep a level head but it's started to really bother me more than it did in August.  If people want more details I'm willing to share some stuff.  I guess all I'm looking for is some guidance on how to cope with this until I can manage to find a resource that's hopefully not too expensive.",22Oct2019,4
4,"About 2-4 times a week I get these episodes of strange mental activity. The only way I can describe these periods is as if it is like my mind is under extreme tension, it feels like I am about to snap.

The periods last about an hour and it feels like this is when all the emotions that I repress usually try to come up, sometimes I feel viscerally angry or sad but it is completely contained within my head. Even if I try I cannot release these feelings, so it feels as if my head is just under so much pressure.

The rest of the time my mind seems to function fine, the only problem that I have usually is that I often feel very guilty or anxious or like I should feel bad about myself, even if I can find no justification behind these thoughts.

I'm not really sure what the purpose of this post is, I think I feel that if I just tell people my problems that will help, or maybe I'm looking for help from the kind people of the internet. I don't know really but I just thought that I should make this post, this is my first time coming out about the inner workings of my mind to anyone so I don't really know how to go about it.",22Oct2019,4
5," The truth is that I don’t remember when I first felt this unnaturally natural feeling, but I remember the police vehicle cutting in front of me as I headed home one late Saturday night after a party years ago. I remember the gun in my 25-year-old face in that leafy Toronto neighbourhood. And I remember the officer feeling for my wallet as I stood somewhere between pissing myself and wanting to disappear. It took him five minutes to tell me I fit the description of a robber in the area, and a little less time to apologize. But I’ve been reliving that day and questioning my safety around white people ever since.

I’ve tried pretending this event was just an unfortunate, one-time circumstance. But over the past few months, I’ve felt more angry, thinking of the friend who called me an N-word when I was 11 years old, and the excuse he gave the following day: “It’s what my dad calls you.” Or the woman from three years ago who tossed me her keys in front of an upscale restaurant thinking I was an attendant. I started to list off other white people in my life—including people I’ve had relationships with—and realized that I quietly distrusted them all.

Across from me in a reclined seat, my Black therapist nodded as it all came back to me in a 30-minute rant. She knew that even after several years, there was a reason why I still remembered the cop and all the other ugly moments that led me to the following conclusion:

“I don’t trust white people.”

I nod back to her, because we both know that this distrust was inherited and may never completely go away.

She fucking ruined me completely, used to be a happy guy. Then she happened.

I can't remember the last time I smiled, felt an emotion other than sadness and anger.

The past year has lead up to this, I don't feel any emotion other than... well nothing.

I constantly worry and think about the end, why try and pursue traditional happiness if someone or something will destroy it. 

Why try and love again when it reality it's all a lie.

16,"Hi. So my name is Seth, and this is me venting on how much I hate how negative Iv been on myself. Note before going any further, this will have a Trigger warning. 

So Iv had issues like this before but I never actually talked about this in such a public matter, and later down you will understand why. Before I got better I went almost 5ish years before getting better, which was thanks to finding very good friends that I adore very well, they helped me gain confidence within myself and made me happy, and helped me with my anxiety and my self loathing issue. They are so supportive and they were the first people I officially told that I had such issues. 

Prior to finding them, I absolutely hated myself. I used to self harm (and eventually had thoughts of suicide) as an escape from thinking so negative to focus on something else, I had anxiety attacks daily and I kept it to myself, cause if I even thought about reaching out I would call myself pathetic and worthless, that I don’t deserve any help, and that I would just annoy them if I reached out. I kept sabotaging myself to feel worse and worse, but it’s how I just felt dealing with it at first. But it started getting better when I got this one job that I genuinely enjoyed, but it was a seasonal job. So after the season ended I just sat at home feeling worse and worse but I had these people that I could talk to on Twitch/Discord. So I started gaining confidence there and encountered said people that are now my greatest friends. But it also introduced another seed of self hatred which was assisted with my anxiety. 

I was scared of three things. A- I was worried I would just annoy them plus with me not knowing how it feels to have a genuine friend, but they kept reassuring me that I am not annoying them, I am okay that I really am their friend.  B- I was worried that they secretly hate me or I am their “Charity Case” and they only keep me around out of pity. And then C- Due to my middle brother planting these thoughts, that I was over stepping my stay, that this friendship will end being there so often (Which he is a deep rooted issue of all my mental health). But the one I call my best friend told me to not worry about what he says, that I will never overstep my stay. That him (my brother) even saying such a thing actually angers him (my friend). 

Fast forward to 2019. At the start of the year, we obtained a very stress enduring letter exclaiming that we need to pay the rest of the mortgage (the father passed away and the daughter took over) by the end of March. We had a good relationship with the original person, and it’s gotten us really scared cause we couldn’t afford the rest of the mortgage due to it being 5 digit figure. But it causes me to become extremely stressed. Then I got work at a different place this year, so the summer was enjoyable at the least, until near the end of the season when I almost quit due to the GM just making me feel worthless, but from what I was told, she’s been doing this all season. But that feeling has not gone away even after a couple months, and now that the seasons ending and I’m just home all the time, and it’s just adding up, and I feel like I just have to let all this out. I couldn’t let it just build up again. I don’t want to just fall into a spiral again. 

Thanks to who ever actually read this. Hope you have a good day.

TL;DR - My mind sabotages itself to make me feel worse, I got better, but this year has taken its toll and I felt like I had to vent on how much I dislike myself because of the stress, anxiety and Self Loathing",22Oct2019,3

18,"Long story short- i switched from Paxil (on for five years) to duloxitine in August then switched doctors who put me on fluoxetine 5 weeks ago. Since switching five weeks ago i’ve Had the worst anxiety of my life- debilitating a few days. Have been in fight or flight constantly. When running my whole body is tight/aches, have chills during the day and generally can’t stop worrying regardless of CBT exercising.

I have been talking now with a medicine management doctor who wants me to continue to ride the fluoxetine out. Has anyone else been on a new medication after a switch for longer than a month with no results and yielded positive benefits in the long run? 

A big part of me is just wishing to go back to the Paxil (I felt generally no highs or lows lately on this which is why I asked to switch, but had no anxiety on this or the duloxitine).",22Oct2019,1
19,"Recently, I've been feeling completely different. I used to be a fairly emotionless person - insults didn't affect me, I was fine being alone, and i didn't care that I barely had any friends. But,a few months ago, I changed, just before I entered Uni. And now, I'm the complete opposite. Because of this I feel lonely practically all of the time. I have one friend, and he lives thousands of miles away, so we can't interact in the way normal friends would. Now however, I feel lonely very often, and it feels physically painful, like a sickness in my heart, and it's likely amplified by how new it is for me.

Because of this, since about a month ago, I now feel suicidal, but it's not how most people seem to think of it.  I don't think of myself as worthless or that no one loves me, more that I can't face feeling so lonely anymore. It used to be only occasionally, but it's gotten more common, and now suicidal fantasies invade my thoughts almost constantly, sometimes making it hard to focus on things like lectures or studying. I find it difficult to keep them at bay, especially at night when I'm not thinking about anything else, and sometimes I'm unable to not think of extremely detailed situations of suicide. For most of the time, I don't think about it a serious answer, but I feel like it's been getting closer to feeling like a true option.

I know this is gonna sound like I'm being really self-pitying and attention-seeking, but I promise that I'm just unsure about it, and need to know if this is normal. I know that most people go through mental changes when they grow up, and when they start living alone.  I've been thinking of telling my parents (who I don't live with anymore), or going to university counselling, but I don't want to start going on a big campaign for something that isn't even a problem.

21,"Hi all,

Anxiety &amp; depression has been a big struggle for me ever since I can remember. I want so desperately to control these parts of myself &amp; learn to live a more outgoing &amp; fulfilling life. I’ve been trying to dig deep recently on why I struggle so much with these obstacles and I’m curious if the household I grew up in was the cause. My brother(18 months my elder) has Asperger’s syndrome, although because it is mild and he’s very functional he wasn’t diagnosed until his early teenage years.. He was a very chaotic child growing up, and would have meltdowns somewhat frequently. I remember my parents having a very difficult time with raising my brother and attending to his needs, and because of their lack of understanding of his disorder there were plenty of loud arguments. Coupled with that, my dad was a business owner &amp; the bread winner, although he made just barely enough to keep a roof over our head and 3 meals a day(very grateful and blessed for that). Him &amp; my mom would often get into fights about finances and wanting him to quit the business to get a better paying job, and all of this just added more fuel to the fire when dealing with my brother due to heightened tension all the time, not to mention they weren’t happy with each other by the time I turned 6 and just decided to stick it out until all kids were out of the house until getting a divorce. My parents really relied on me to have myself put together, and would often praise me for being such an easy child to raise since their hands were always full, and have told me numerous times that life just seems “so easy” for me and I was blessed with the positive traits of both my parents and minimal negative aspects. I can’t even recall having any intimate conversations with them about my own struggles to this day, although they often come to me with their struggles, more frequently now than before. I recently confided in my mother when we were sharing a bottle of wine, and she was completely shocked to hear I struggle with anxiety &amp; depression, although I spared her of the severity of it and downplayed it, and we haven’t revisited the topic since then(she’s going through a midlife crisis right now and in an unhealthy relationship, 90% of our convos are about her state of wellbeing). 

I really think that my parents expectations of me &amp; being labeled as the level headed, reliable &amp; well-off child of the family caused me to develop an extremely withdrawn personality. I would really like to know if there are any others here that grew up in similar households, were your results the same or how did they differ, and how were you able to overcome the setbacks? 

Also just a quick note, my parents were very loving and I know I’m blessed to have a family like the one I just described, there are others that have gone through way worse than I have and have been able to survive &amp; thrive. I guess I’m just looking to find people I can relate with and possibly validate my theories. 

If you made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any &amp; all responses! 🙂",22Oct2019,3
22,"I'm seemingly healthy and normal. Ain't that a bitch? Because here I am, my fiance away for a conference, an hour away from people who might care, by myself in my living room crying, because I feel totally alone. Anytime I'm forced to be by myself in our apartment I end up challenging the silence with pathetic sobs. At this point I've told a few people that I'd be free, because he is away and I'd love to have them over just to hang out and talk. The way that I imagine most women do with girlfriends, but I don't know if I really have those. I throw this pity party every time I'm alone, because I can't handle being alone and I don't know why or what's wrong with me. Those people usually reply with, ""Aw, let me see what I'm doing!"" or ""I'm super busy, but I'll let you know!"" 

So, here we are night one and I've been home alone. I'm a nursing student so I studied a little bit. Then, I realized I didn't know what else to do with myself. I wonder if the people I texted even considered hanging out or if they just reply and move on? I love everyone so deeply in my life and I would do anything to make others happy and so sometimes it just feels like shit to need people and never have anyone there. But as I type this I'm like self-loathing, because I have more good days than bad, days and time where people are there figuratively so even if they can't be physically then what gives me the right to feel this way?? I mean, the only person that I could think of right now that would understand is my freaking manager - and so I texted her! Because truthfully, she's the only one that I think really knows me right now. I don't have outlets, or vices, or hobbies. I used to write and draw and sing and now I just go to bed when I'm alone, because I can't find it in myself to do any of those things. Full disclosure, I used to be on medication for GAD and I stopped in June, by choice and with physician approval and instruction. I have a very complicated and trying relationship with my beautiful mother who is states away and struggling herself and I wish I could just go talk to her right now. These last few months have just been too much for me internally, mentally, I can't process any of my feelings right and the worst part is I know how to, logically, but I just can't do any of it.

26,"For background, I’ve experienced major depression since I was a kid and serious anxiety for the last decade or so, as well as self harm for the last 15 years or so. 

Recently I’ve been struggling really badly with my mental health. At first I thought I could attribute it to a recent breakup and the moving out process, but that’s been completely done for a bit and my brain just can’t. Get. Out of it. 

Historically August through October has been tough on me (the anniversary effect is real, y’all) but recently I feel like things have been so much worse than they have been and I can’t shake it. 

I am a photographer in my free time and to occasionally make a little money and my desire, drive, and passion is nearly gone. Entirely.  And it’s bleeding over into everything else. My desire to even sit down and commit to watching a light and easy show for even 30 minutes is hard, like even my attention span and focus is fucked. My passion for other things is nearly gone. It’s disheartening to say the slightest. 

What’s scary isn’t necessarily these feelings, they’re not foreign to me at all, but the thing that scares me is that this all just feels like the beginning, like before too long it’s going to be worse than I’ve experienced for a long while. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want it to get worse, but I can’t find it within myself to find what I can do to make it keep from getting worse. And all that I can do now is to drink liquor and plug in my headphones and try to drown out these intrusive and harmful thoughts. I know it’s not a healthy or good coping mechanism, but it’s what I’ve got for now. 

I need help, or at least a little support. I don’t want to load my family or friends down with this weight, they’d try to help but only make me feel worse inadvertently, so I’m turning to one of my other communities. Here.

Hey, I don’t know if anyone will read this and I don’t know why it matters. I feel like I need advice but at the same time it seems pointless. I’ve been on a kind of self-improvement / self-love mission in which I’ve recognized that there’s no point in hating myself, but I feel like I’m failing. I’m trying to be a better, nicer person who makes responsible decisions and treats people with respect, but I feel like no matter what I do I’m always letting people down, hurting people, and being a useless member of society. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, and I don’t know how to fix it. Every day I feel like I’m digging myself deeper into increasingly depressing hole and I don’t know how to stop. How do I make myself a better person and stop feeling like this?

I don’t know if context helps, but I’m 22F and yes I am seeing a therapist. I dropped out of school because I failed out of my program and I’m planning on going back next year, I’m just working and saving up. I hate my job, I feel like I’m the laughing stock of my work and I’ve even fucked things up with people who are nice to me. I barely have any friends, but I have a really awesome and supportive girlfriend and I’m so in love with her. I’ve never been in love before. I was in a relationship with a man in my late teens and we lived together for two years but it never felt like this. He was my best friend and my biggest supporter but at the same time I hated him and I was so angry. I was a terrible person in my teens, I couldn’t cope with my family circumstances and took my pain out on myself, him, and a few other people. I self harmed, had violent sex, had sex with married men, and I felt so fucking empty. Nothing was good enough and I hated myself and everyone else. My partner was my best friend but I never loved him, I just couldn’t bear being alone. I tried breaking up with him a few times because I was so frustrated but we never left each other and I don’t know why, but it clearly wasn’t working. I’ve always felt so sexually dysfunctional and like the only way I could feel anything was if it was reckless and painful. I’m sorry, this is a mess.

I did realize how fucked up my relationship was and I did manage to end it. I felt and feel awful for how I behaved, but I continued to act out in the ways I listed above and that’s what led to me dropping out of school. I was and I’ve been trying to change but I was still so fucking lost.

Then I met my girlfriend. She’s perfect and I feel like I don’t deserve her. I can’t even describe in words how wonderful she is, the world is a cruel place to make someone so beautiful amongst all the ugly, hateful people. I’m fucking crying writing this like a stupid baby, I don’t know how someone so lovely is in my life and I’m so grateful but I still feel so hopeless and horrible. I don’t want to hurt her or anyone else but I feel like I’m a waste of space. I thought I knew what it felt like to be in love and like I was wrong or my ex partner was gay or I don’t know what I thought. I’m experiencing sex that isn’t frustrating (/totally infuriating/painful) and intimacy that feels deep and real and I want to marry her. I didn’t even think monogamy was possible. I thought everyone saw women the way I did but I never thought a woman could see me that way. I tried so hard to be desirable to men but then I never wanted the attention and that’s so fucked up. I was having sex with someone and they said “one day you’re going to find a man who will love you and own you and use you” and all I did was cry and say that it would be a woman and I have no idea why I said that or why I ever put myself in that situation. What’s wrong with me? Why did I have sex with horrible people? I had sex with really nice men but it was so boring. I had sex with really horrible men and it was so traumatic. I’m so grateful to be where I am now and I’m so glad that part of my life is over but I feel like my past is too much of a burden. My therapist says I need to let it go and forgive myself and I’m trying but sometimes I feel like I haven’t changed. Like I’m still a hateful, horrible, stupid, embarrassing person that makes terrible, destructive decisions.


Like if I know I’m selfish and an idiot and that it’s in my power to change that, why haven’t I been successful? Please help me. I’m so embarrassed by how self pitying and angsty this sounds, but I really don’t know what to do. I can barely afford therapy and I know I’ve made progress but I still feel like I should just die or something. Like my life is over and I’m never going to amount to anything. I can’t deal with my sexuality and I keep trying to act like it isn’t an issue but I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me. I keep crying during and / or after sex because I’m in disbelief of how good this is. Like I don’t deserve it and I can’t be gay because that’s disrespectful to gay people. I’m at work and I just want to quit. I want to go back to school but I need to work for at least a few more months. Why am I such a mess? I feel like I need a friend but I don’t want to be a burden, I can’t talk about this to anyone in my life because I don’t want to make them feel bad. Please help me, what do I do?",22Oct2019,3
30,"I recently went back too school after a break to a new class. I don't talk a lot so you can guess how many friends I have. There is this d-bag dude in class who is not disciplined, unconscientious and swears a lot. Yesterday, he asked for my answers which I worked really hard on and I refused. He started saying he would spit on my mom and the only thought in my head is how I could literally kill him with my bare hands at that time. 

I'm 18, and I had a long history of being violent and controlling myself I'm afraid I might do something I will regret I don't want to spend my life in jail. Any advice",22Oct2019,1
31,Okay I please need your help or I’ll literally die crying everyday. I have this feeling EVERY DAY now I just don’t feel like I exist.

32,"Earlier today I actually was able to make myself to talk about things and it was really nice to finally talk about things and I being able to talk about all the shitty things I did in my past without being judged really made me feel better, the only thing I didn't like was that once it was over I got really exhausted and fell asleep as soon as I got home. I don't have much to say but I'm just really happy that I might be able to get away from all of my issues and get on with life, also this is kinda unrelated but I also was just having a really good day today because the guy I like asked me to be his boyfriend and we talked about a lot of fun, also today was so great I actually got stuff done instead of just sitting around doing nothing.

I just really had a good day and wanted to talk post about it so sorry that I don't have much to write about.",22Oct2019,1
33,"Hello! I've noticed a problematic pattern of thoughts in myself throughout college (I'm a male and I'm 22) and I'm not sure what exactly it is or how to address it but was wondering if someone on here might have any input on it. 

I've noticed that in situations that require me to express any kind of individuality to other people, I get really stressed and avoid it if I can. A great example: this weekend, I'm throwing a halloween party. Almost half the people I invited asked if they could wear their costumes and I said of course and so now I'm telling people that costumes are optional. My friends are encouraging me to wear a costume too and this is where the problem comes in. One of my friends has sent me a few pictures of costumes and other costume ideas and I can't help but get a sunken feeling in my stomach when I think about wearing any costume, or worse - not wearing a costume, around everyone else. It's like I already know my costume (or lack of a costume) won't be as good as everyone else's. And I know that's irrational but the bigger issue is that none of these costumes really feel like me. When I try to think about what ""my type of costume"" would look like, I can't envision anything. I don't have a draw towards any movie or TV characters and it just feels like maybe I'm a boring person and that's why I don't have costume ideas. I'm not stressed to throw the party or be around unfamiliar and familiar faces, yet when it comes to putting together a costume, I'm suddenly stressed and it doesn't make much sense to me.

I do this exact same process when picking out clothes. I'm almost afraid to buy new stuff because I don't know if what I'm trying on fits my ""image"" or if other people will think the new clothes are weird. And then I spend a bunch of time trying to figure out what ""my style"" is and I come up blank so I just stick to the exact same types of outfits I always wear and end up dissatisfied with it.

This same thought process inhibits me in other areas of my life too and I'm really not sure what to call it or how to address it. It seems like some kind of confidence thing that I should've resolved in like junior high but I'm not sure if it's a bigger issue. I just want to have a good halloween costume to get hammered in with my friends! 

Thanks in advance for anyone who has any input for me and hopefully this isn't a dumb post.",22Oct2019,1
34,"Not a native English speaker currently in the US. 

I've been in a mental health downward spiral for more than 2 years now, starting with severe depression and developing panic attacks and major anxiety in the last year. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist and I'm on 100 mg of Zoloft. 

I'm attending  a pretty prestigious school that helps students a lot with mental health issues since stress is a major problem here. However, I feel that because of this reason all the counselors and mental health professionals I talk to believe my problem is stress or not being able to keep up with the material and that is making it really difficult for my issues to be taken seriously. I strongly believe there's something else that is wrong with me. I have my hypothesis, the most prevalent one is that I have ADD and that it got mixed with some pretty emotionally stressful changes in my life and it has become a deathly feedback loop but I don't wanna go off that tangent right now.

The thing is that I feel like every person I talk to doesn't tell me anything new and the pills can only do so much to numb the pain and I really feel like I'm stuck in a very very deep hole right now. I leave bed at 5pm every day, I leave my room once a week at most, I barely eat, I rarely shower and I haven't done school work since the beginning of the year and in the last week I've been getting really intense suicidal thoughts. I've had them before, I've wanted to stop existing plenty of times but this time they are way stronger and way more frequent. 

I seriously feel like I need help and I've looked for it in all the places I know already and I don't know what to do anymore. I have even considered telling my psychiatrist that I'm suicidal *(which would be a little exaggerated since I don't have a plan yet)* so I would be interned on a hospital and at least make sure I eat, shower, take my medication and receive therapy frequently, but that is a a last option and even tho I have really good insurance with my university I highly  doubt they would cover it and me and my family are broke right now. Do any of you know what other options I have or what should I do next? If you have been in a similar situation, what worked for you?",22Oct2019,3
35,"Phobias can be absolutely terrible things. They can take over and rule your life, overriding logic and all else. I know this for a fact because I suffer from extreme emetophobia. It makes my anxiety go into super high gear if I think about vomiting myself or other people vomiting. Yes I know it usually goes away on its own. Yes I know I'm not going to die from it. But that doesn't stop the irrational fear from consuming my thoughts. What if my boyfriend comes home sick? What if I get sick? What if I suddenly develop morning sickness this late in pregnancy? What if I throw up during delivery? What if my child throws up? I have all these thoughts and I absolutely hate myself for it. Why cant I just be normal?",22Oct2019,1
36,"A little over a week ago, my parents decided to bring home this adorable little 8 week old shepherd and spaniel puppy. At first, she seemed like she would be a pretty calm puppy and I was pretty excited. But as she started to grow comfortable with us and started doing the typical puppy things such as chewing on things and going to the bathroom everywhere, it began to go downhill.

We had established a while back when we fostered a 1 year old puppy for 2 days that my mental health could not handle having a puppy. She was very energetic and wasn’t House right and it caused me to start having severe panic attacks and I declined very quickly. 

Now, not only did they decide for everyone that we were getting another dog, but since I am home all the time, I have found myself in the position of taking care of her more than the rest of my family, and I didn’t even want her. My depression has gotten worse, I’m having more panic attacks and am constantly on the verge of tears. And my family doesn’t seem to care unless I snap and start screaming at them, then I am in the wrong and they just yell at me and call me disrespectful. They don’t even acknowledge that it’s my anxiety. Anytime I try to tell them about it, they either brush it off or somehow seem to twist it and make it to where I am in the wrong.

The worst part about this is since I graduated a few months ago, just moved, don’t have friends and my family just doesn’t care anymore, I am left without a support system and therefore, nobody to talk to about this.",22Oct2019,3

Even though the big business of college has fucked me over for the past five years (regardless of my debt and never upcoming graduation), I see that people in this thread deal with so much more adversity than me and I have only the utmost respect for you all.

39,"38yo male here. Last week, I was having some minor chest pain. After a couple days, I went downstairs and got light-headed and felt like I was having a hard time breathing. For context, I vape nicotine as a replacement for cigarettes, which I quit about a year ago. I started to freak out, and ended up working myself into what I think was a full blown panic attack. Body went numb, I wanted to crawl out of my skin, heart was pounding. 

Wife took me to the ER. Physically everything was fine, though my ekg was a bit off. They kept me overnight to do a stress test in the morning. Stress test checked out. I had another panic attack at night. I felt it coming on, then when a nurse came to draw blood, I freaked out. 

I've been under some stress. Just moved across the state, paid a bunch of money, moved to a higher COL area, my current job is struggling and I'm afraid we may go under (and its my job to bring in $$ but I'm not good at it). I've been picking up side work, not sleeping well. 

Fast forward a week and I've felt better. I traveled for work. I was on the subway to go get some dinner tonight, and the panic attack just hit me out of nowhere again. I was able to control it this time through focused breathing, but it is terrifying, and I don't know why it is happening (other than stress). 

After the ER, I went to see a PCP who recommended Wellbutrin. I tried WB about eight years ago and didn't like how it made me feel (depressed) so we skipped for now. I also have a bipolar mother. 

For those who get panic attacks, how do you identify the triggers, and how do you manage the condition? It is all very new to me, and I feel like I'm losing control of my body.

43,"Last night my(M23) friend(F22) came over to my house. She just came from a party. She was tipsy.

I thought we were having a great time. (We've been hooking up for 8 months now)

Eventually I needed to use the restroom. When i came back to my room she was laying down, eyes closed. I approached and there was a pocket knife in her hand and fresh cuts on her arm.

I took the knife from her hand as she laid there presumably pretending to be asleep. I took Kleenex and cleaned the blood running down her arm.

No words were spoken.

About a minute later she ""woke up"". She apologized and said that she had to do it. I was still processing and had shutdown. I couldn't really bring myself to talk.

She went to use the restroom and when she returned she was all fun-mode again. I wasn't. She said that she wanted to just forget it happened. I told her this was the one time I couldn't just overlook what had just happened. She said that I knew she's done it before so it isn't that big of a deal. I told her that I didn't think she was really asleep and that it felt like she had intentionally posed herself to be found that way. She swore that she really was asleep and that she didn't mean to be found that way. She continued to apologise profusely and told me that it would never happen again.

We went to bed soon after.

The next day she sent me a text:

""Im really really really sorry...i promise i wont do it ever again. Please dont think i did it for attention, pity, or emotional manipulation. Please forgive me. I was just trying to dull my emotional pain with physical pain. Theres multiple other reasons why we do it. I love you and dont mean to hurt you. Please forget about it.""

She knows that I'm not mad at her and that I care about her. But I want her to get professional help. She needs it.

Is there a better way that I could have reacted to this? And would it be wrong for me to tell her that I won't be her friend unless she seeks help? What can I do to help her?",22Oct2019,4
44,"This weekend just gone I spent a night with a man I had been speaking to again after a few years. I had no intentions of wanting anything more than just a friendly sexual experience and even now I want a friend out of him. Anyways, as hes walking me back to the train station another man walks by, to which he points out he had previously slept with him, but not only that but that it was a threesome with his best friend aswell. 
I didn't take this too well and whilst sat on the train alone once again my mind was running wild, this feeling of being used and pure jealousy resurfaced, something that had caused me my biggest breakdown about 4 years ago when I found out another guy I was seeing slept with someone else in the time he was talking to me. I once again started messaging him and told him how I was upset and how I wish he hadn't said that, only I wanted to hurt him and make him feel guilty for how I've pretty much made myself feel. 
A few days have passed and we have spoke over text after I apologised and explained why I felt how I did, I no longer got those goodnight texts or didn't get a good morning text like I had before the night we spent together.
I've been breaking down all day, suicidal thoughts that I thought I had conquered revisited me for the first time in years. Why do I feel the need to constantly want to be the best someone has expierienced and unrealistically want to be the only expierience in my mind? I still just want him to be a friend but feel I have ruined that chance now with this hatred I have created within me, he even told me the guys name when he pointed him out and in my downtime at work tonight I searched his following on instagram and found the guy and compared myself to him, thinking to myself how psychotic and just how much hatred do I have for myself to be putting myself through this trauma yet again with someone.

Basically, I'm attractive, I'm cool, I'm all that and I have exactly one person I can call my true friend and its my ex (not the most recent one, the one before that). Its kind of unfair to call him just an ex since we've been hooking up all summer, but thats irrelevant to my point. 

I have high functioning depression. 2 weeks ago, I finally broke down... in front of my boss. He was very understanding while I pulled it together and filed for a weeks vacation. I got back last friday, then called my job and told them I was quitting.

I am going to start therapy and finally start dealing with my mess head on, but what that really means is I have to start telling people I pushed away about my depression. They're good people - people who WANT TO BE CLOSE TO ME, but because of my irrational fear and shame, I never trust them all the way and so our bonds remain totally stunted.

I believe my anxiety and depression stem from many, many, things in my childhood that have never been addressed or resolved in my 22 years of being alive. After getting a divorce my mom began to take her anger out on me verbally and “spankings” were thrown out left and right. I remember the times where I would wake up or come home from school praying that I would have some peace, but whether she was talking about me of my father it was always loud, harsh, negative words almost every single day of my life until graduating community college. I do have an adopted sister who is 4mo younger than me which means my mom did not treat her the same nor do the things she did to me because she didn’t want her to feel like she didn’t belong (she has admitted this to me). This mentality of hers not only fucked up how I interact, trust, and perceive others, but I feel like my body is shutting down because of how little I’m eating every day now that I am alone in college. In high school my mom would rarely make dinner for me and my sister due to her working and paying bills which I recognize and appreciate). This would mean I would only eat one meal a day (school lunch) and maybe one more if I wanted to cook for myself or found something in the fridge. This started the habit of not eating 3 meals a day. After graduating high school I went to community college for 4 years while living with her and my dad on and off (she pretty much made me stay since we have a community college less than 10 min away). This same cycle of one meal a day continued as I was on a tennis team and would only eat dinner since I had classes during the day and tennis in the afternoon. I also developed an aversion to breakfast foods because the only time I would get breakfast would be when I was at my dads house, and he always made sure to give us at least breakfast and dinner. My dad was my #1 in the world. Even though I would only get to see him on the weekends until I got my drivers license (my mom would make a big deal about me driving up to see him when I wanted to and would create storm after storm so I went up less frequently. My dad understood since he was married to her), he would empathize and console me when I would complain about my mom, he never got mad at me, he always made me smile whenever I saw him, he laughed at my jokes, he made me know what actually loving a parent means, and he was a part of me. After his death at the young age of 60 last year I didn’t really feel the effects of grief as intense then as I do now; away from my family, friends, and boyfriend. I cry way more than I have in my entire life and I have absolutely no appetite unless I smoke weed. I have developed physical symptoms from my anxiety like IBS-D, GERD, and severe weight loss (I dropped 40 lbs in 2-3 months and have probably lost more, but I did have infected wisdom tooth which may have contributed as well). I guess my reasoning for my anxiety would be the fear of never finding anyone like my dad who cared for me and actually knew who I was, along with the fact I have made zero friends since I have moved. My boyfriend does come visit but I have never gotten that feeling of him really KNOWING who I am. After 2 years of us dating 2 years he never said he loved me or even liked me (he asked me out over Snapchat), complimented me beyond “cute” and “you look good”, or really knew how to deal with my emotions during times where I would become vulnerable. I felt and sometimes still feel like I’m the man in the relationship because I would make all the plans even for anniversaries, I would get gifts I knew he would like but mine always felt off and rushed with stuff I didn’t really associate with, I’m taller than him (which was not a problem at all until I started to feel like a man), never got any femenine compliments besides the ones about my “assets” and sex life, and people would tell me that certain things he does is weird like him sitting on my lap. I tried to break if off with him a few months ago but he swore that he loved me and that he would change. I’m afraid I may have made a mistake in taking him back since I constantly think about I was the one that had to say something in order for him to even tell me he loved me let alone get a basic compliment. When I see him he is sweet and caring but we never do deep conversations in order to REALLY know each other... I would open up about what I like and don’t like, but would later realize that he either forgot I said it or wasn’t listening. This makes me think I may have wasted time in finding someone else who can treat me how I want, but I am also afraid of making the wrong decision and breaking up with him just because I am depressed/anxious. All of these events have some how led to me barely eating anything everyday and never leaving my apartment. I joined an ultimate frisbee club as a rookie to help me get out an exercise and meet people but my anxiety of holding everyone back at practice and the symptoms I get after the workouts have stopped me from going to two practices , and then I reflect on that it makes me just want to quit and let them be better off without me. I have gotten to the point where if I didn’t have my baby Jackson (he is a cat), I would have gotten more serious about suicide but he is my only bright light that always brings me comfort. I know it may be weird to have a cat be there main thing keeping you alive but having always been a huge cat lover I could never. Now all I do is sit in my couch or lay in my bed until I have school, praying one day I  wake up without anxiety and that the good times I know are coming, will be here. But here we are. 

This is clearly not everything that is going on but the main things that pop into my head atm. I have been planning on seeing a counselor at my school and will try my best tomorrow to call and make an appointment along with stopping by the health center for a checkup and to address my non-eating problem

**TL;DR:** my anxiety and depression are causing me to not have an appetite and thus I rarely cook or eat possibly due to my dads death and personal relationships. I feel “off” everyday, rarely leave my apartment, and am having conflict in regards to those relationships which feeds the problem. I am going to try to use the counseling center and health center to approach both ailments as a starting point.",22Oct2019,1
62,"I was getting ready to take a shower and I was looking at myself naked in the mirror. I usually see myself naked maybe once a day but it’s usually no longer than a quick glance.

63,"I'll attempt to keeps things as succinct as possible, but it's a lot to swallow. Within the last 20 months, my 29F cousin has undergone a fairly substantial change in her personality, in her behaviors with the family/friends/relationship, and how she copes with stress. She began exhibiting these behaviors in early 2018 and it's only gotten worse. The family has tried to sit down with her to discuss these changes, but she's avoided the discussion, going so far as to not contact us for long periods of time. Getting her a professional evaluation seems impossible at the moment. Her and I grew up together and were like brother and sister until early last year - this too has changed. Really trying to figure out what's happened to her and the best path forward. We love her and just want her to be back to her normal self.

1. Most recently, she left her boyfriend of two years after living together with him for only two weeks. He and I speak regularly and he's at a loss for what happened; when they moved in together (in a different city), he says she was constantly depressed, had no appetite, and their normal levels of affection dropped to zero. She would cry herself to sleep each night and not want to leave the home. I was able to speak to her before she packed up and left their home and she said he was nothing but great to her, but that she was homesick, confused, and stressed. Since she's arrived back to our city, she's avoided contact with nearly everyone in our family, excluding her sister (who reached out to her multiple times before finally speaking with her - once). She has seemingly blocked my texts and calls. Where she's living is a mystery.
2. In the last 18-24 months, she has gone from being very family oriented to very distant with all of us. Regular visits, phone calls, and texts became rare before she moved. She became agitated and confrontational with both her mother and my mother the last time we were all together, for no good reason. Most of her long-term friendships have deteriorated (by her own admission). Her relationship with her youngest sister went from a tight bond to non-existent. She attempted to take an electronic device that didn't belong to her from her ex-BF.
3. Her personality has gone from bubbly and sweet to easily agitated and cold in the span of this time. This is the family consensus - and confirmed by the ex-bf. She became easily agitated with her niece and nephew, when otherwise she used to be so patient with them. 
4. Stress. So much stress for her - everything causes her large amounts of stress, so it seems. She misplaced her passport a few months ago - and found it the same day - but was stressed about it for two days afterwards. She had copious amounts of stress when making simple travel arraignments. She was stressed about having to take an uber to meet at the restaurant for our grandmother's b-day. She stressed herself to tears when cracked her phone screen. She was always so good at coping with stress, even teaching a class about stress management at her job. This is so unlike her.

64,"Not sure how to describe it, but I have a weird feeling as if my body slowly stops working. And I don’t feel like doing anything about it. 
I’ve been depressed for the last 6 years and three years ago was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and social anxiety. Meds and therapy didn’t work, but I somehow felt better and went to the university abroad. It’s my second year now and I completely isolated myself from everyone from back home and didn’t find any friends at university. Literally don’t talk to anyone now, I tried to get to know people during the first year, but it seems like my awkwardness just made them dislike me immediately. As well as no one ever tried to talk to me.
For the last few days I had weird feelings. It’s hard to focus my eyes on anything, I feel dizziness and keep bumping into everything on my way, my hands are barely listening to me. It feels like my body is no longer under my control. It’s not anxiety, but I don’t know what it is. And no idea what to do.

66,"I know what depression is, I've dealt with it for a long time. I've also dealt with suicidal thoughts for a long time and having them with the absence of depression. My brain will go blank but I'll still be thinking, just without emotion. And I'll only have semi-control over my body. Like my body is in auto-pilot. Then I'll have thoughts of how to kill myself, pool pain-killers in my hand, research easy ways to off myself, lean over the edge of a railing. But it wont be for any reason in particular, so it's odd to me.   
I have panic attacks where I'll want to kill myself to end anxiety. I'll have depressive episodes where I'm so sad I feel better off without anything. I'm in pretty much constant chronic pain, so logically it makes sense to stop it. But sometimes there is no cause of the suicidal thoughts, I'll just be blank with that motive sitting in the white noise.",22Oct2019,2

68,"I was accepted into the Peace Corps in June and received a mental health non-clearance in August. The basis for this decision is described in the appeal letter posted below. The appeal was rejected and I will not be eligible until I have officially gone a year without attending any counseling sessions. The decision made me lose a lot of respect for the Peace Corp organization and its policies. The idea that something as harmless as trying to be proactive about my mental health and attending therapy once or twice a month can be used as grounds for rejection is pretty shocking and discriminatory. My counselor also wrote a letter in support of my appeal indicating that I was fully capable of managing my deployment without mental health support, as the nature of my attendance was not indicative of the presence of any issues or concerns. I guess the Peace Corps has a zero tolerance policy for proactive health and wellness behaviors. Anyway, just thought I'd share...

Also, I removed a few names and locations that were in the original letter.


To Whom It May Concern,

This letter is in regards to the Peace Corps Office of Medical Services’ decision to reject my previously accepted application into the Peace Corps. The basis for this decision was described as, “The reasons for non-clearance concern your active symptoms and current engagement in therapy.” These implications are unwarranted as they falsely indicate a degree of concern which is in no way representative of the reality of the situation. Furthermore, such a false categorization of mental health issues stigmatizes the pursuit of psychological fulfillment as an inevitable indication of mental instability.

As I described in my initial personal statement regarding my mental health, the basis for my pursuit of therapy was due to having felt unhappy following the ending of a long term relationship. In fact, the main impetus was simply having recently been made aware of a veteran benefit regarding veteran counseling opportunities. This benefit allotted a certain number of counseling sessions to service members. I consulted a local VA doctor who suggested that I attend a few free sessions. I quickly developed a positive relationship with my counselor and chose to continue attending sessions on a semi-monthly basis as a means of being proactive in how I manage my personal goals and interests. This was not a tool for coping with or overcoming any significant psychological issues. This was a means for self-analysis and the pursuit of a more fulfilling life direction.  Ironically, these sessions proved to be the catalyst which motivated me to apply to the Peace Corp, a personal goal which I had been considering for my entire adult life.

I am certainly aware of the importance of verifying the mental stability of candidates prior to their participation in the Peace Corps volunteer program. This endeavor involves a significant investment of time and resources, therefore, there is an understandable need to ensure that candidates are fully capable of managing the mental and psychological challenges they are likely to face. It is distressing, however, to discover that these procedures are rigid in a way that does not seem to account for the varied reasons a person may choose to be proactive regarding mental health. By stating that I may be unfit for service based on the fact that I chose to utilize a benefit offered to me and seek counseling over a relatively minor life event, there is an implication that the pursuit of counseling or therapy is inherently indicative of an overarching mental health concern. This kind of perception is both archaic and serves to perpetuate extremely negative stereotypes regarding the pursuit of mental health. Feeling occasionally depressed or anxious following the ending of a long term relationship is not indicative of a potentially serious mental health issue. These are obviously common reactions to a common life event. 

The implication that I must complete one year without attending therapy to verify that I have effectively “recovered” is perhaps the most problematic implication in my denial letter. This indicates a perception of the pursuit of therapy as being necessarily rooted in a psychological disorder rather than simply an activity a person can pursue in order to proactively seek a superior mental state. By this logic, a couple participating in therapy as a means of improving their relationship does not seem suited for Peace Corps service. Participation in counseling sessions twice of month is clearly not indicative of an urgent mental health crisis. If it were, it seems likely those sessions would be much more frequent and that the use of prescription medications would be utilized as a coping tool.

When my counselor completed my mental health information packet she specifically stated that she felt I was fully capable of coping with challenges that Peace Corps volunteers are often expected to face. Her comment indicated that she believes I would be an ideal candidate for the Peace Corps as I have consistently expressed a desire to pursue something more fulfilling and seek to find a career better suited for my skillset and experience. If the professional opinion of an experienced mental healthcare specialist does not satisfy the concerns of those reviewing my case, it seems that an interview with a Peace Corps medical representative would be an effective opportunity for me to discuss my history and enable a more accurate evaluation of my status. 

It is disappointing that I am forced to disclose so much information that I would typically regard as private in order to defend my right and ability to successfully perform a task I am fully capable of achieving. This fact was originally confirmed by the Peace Corps’ initial acceptance of my application into the organization. This was also demonstrated through my completion of military service in the United States Coast Guard. During my enlistment I was stationed at a small and isolated unit. The site was on a Native American. I spent three and half years serving in this region and during that time I advanced my position twice, completing my four year enlistment as a Second Class Petty Officer. In the period following my military service, I have completed both a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree program. These achievements clearly demonstrate my ability to cope in environments that are challenging, stressful, isolating, and require great personal commitment and dedication. 

The idea that this unexpected obstacle may result in a situation where I might never have the opportunity to serve in the Peace Corps is both disappointing as well as disconcerting. This organization is one that I have the utmost respect and admiration for, and to be potentially rejected on problematic and fallacious grounds is, frankly, quite troubling. I have encountered many people throughout my life who, despite personal need, have voiced an unwillingness to pursue any sort of counseling or assistance with their mental health. They feel that having any record of participation in counseling might negatively impact their potential career pursuits.  Their basis for concern is perfectly illustrated by the situation I’m presently facing. If people are penalized for being proactive about their mental health, regardless of the lack of any mental illness, it’s clear that many people who could benefit from assistance will be disinclined to seek it out. 

Policies which perpetuate these attitudes would seem to be counterintuitive to the social perception that pursuing improved mental health is a wise and reasonable endeavor. If people are disinclined to seek assistance as result of negative societal stereotypes and discriminatory policies, this would discourage individuals from pursuing counseling simply as a means of improving their lives and being proactive about their personal wellness and happiness. These practices can provide useful insights into coping with normal day to day issues with stress, which in turn can make an individual better equipped to address common challenges and concerns. 
The policies and attitudes being presented are harmful to individuals such as myself, who are not in need but acknowledge the benefits of counseling, as well as to those who have a genuine need based on psychological illness, but may fear seeking any kind of assistance due to the negative stigmatization associated with the pursuit of counseling. 

The decision to reject my application on the grounds of concerns over my mental health is unwarranted and should be reversed. These polices and perceptions regarding the pursuit of counseling are harmful, and do not demonstrate a reasonable basis for concern or rejection. The dismissal of previously accepted candidates due to false perceptions relating to mental health perpetuates negative attitudes which have a vast social impact. A failure to reasonably address this issue will serve to continue these trends of unreasonable attitudes, harming many individuals in the process. It is my hope that the Peace Corp Organization chooses to reverse this decision and again provide me with the opportunity to perform my two years of service.",22Oct2019,27
69,"Gonna keep this short and simple and I won't disclose much about my personal life. Was feeling anxious and angry and fearful as fuck after a big fight with my mother about something serious. Standard everyday stuff, my heart rate going up, random bursts of fear and sweat. Suddenly ly it disappeared. At first I thought my attack had passed and I'd feel better. Except it didn't. I wasn't scared at all. But simple things like stretching my back or hearing something that would make me laugh were replaced with nothing. I got kinda scared, until I realized this time I couldn't exactly feel my heart beat, nor did I feel anything physical at all. It's more like I was scared of the fact that I couldn't feel scared. I started thinking about my life and the fight I just had, simple things that would remind me about my impending future, but I tried to feel something, even forcing myself to feel angry or scared, but it's like my body couldn't. You know how when you crack you knuckles, jack off, yawn or stretch your back really well and you can sort of deep a positive feeling move throughout your body out of your will? It's not happening. At all. No good feelings or bad feelings, even if forced, and I'm started to get concerned because it's out of my power to feel like this and the most k feel is a burn in my heart. Any advice? I've tried my best to never self diagnose and I've always been very active in my family, school, and friend circle to make sure nobody misused the word depression and I'd always try and spread awareness. But this is something way out of my league that I'm experiencing, and if I could feel scared, I probably would be. I don't even feel like getting out of bed or talking to anyone, it's almost like I'm too tired to, somehow. Please help me.",22Oct2019,2

Is there a good way to kind of dissapear for a month to focus on getting mentally healthier without answering a barrage of questions about it? I already plan to shutdown social media and remove myself from any work group chats.

74,"Hi.

I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible as I don't want to take up too much of your time or give out too much personal information.

The past two-and-a-half to three months have been an emotional roller coaster for me. Long story short, I lost the career and the plan I had for the next six years of my life in a span of five weeks due to a severe flare-up of anxiety that I thought I had moved past. However, I was diagnosed with a full-blown anxiety disorder. Six weeks after that, I wound up back in my parent's house with no car and no job.  I'm basically stuck in here until I can get a car because of where I live.

Anyways, for the past week-and-a-half or so, I've constantly been having thoughts of hurting myself. I start thinking that I'm a burden and that everyone I care about is going to start hating me because I do stupid things when I get really anxious (example: I've been getting so worked up over texts from certain people for various reasons that I haven't responded to them. I hate myself for it). I don't know why. I don't want to do those things. I know that my people care and would voice any grievances with me. 

I also know that what happened isn't the end of everything. I know that I can recover from this and eventually get back on my feet. 

As for what I should do about it... I can't tell my parents. I can't do that to them and I know that they aren't going to know what to do either. And that's okay. I don't expect them to. I don't want to tell my friends because they have enough problems right now and I don't want to add to the stress that they're dealing with. It's also not bad enough for me to call a hotline. 

I won't have health insurance for another three months, so I can't really afford therapy right now. Also, I've been considering taking medication for my anxiety, but I can't go talk to a doctor about it while I'm living in my parent's house because they're against psychotropic medication.

I'm kind of at a loss right now. I'm scared it's just going to keep getting worse and I won't be able to pull myself out of it or something.

Thank you if you took the time to read all of this and/ or decide to respond. I really appreciate it as this was really hard for me to write.",22Oct2019,1

77,"(I'm sorry if this isn't the subreddit for it but I wasn't really sure where to go. Naturally, if this is the wrong place, I'll delete it and put it where it should be.)
This might sound dumb, and I'm sure that there are other factors that contributed to this, but this past Sunday (10/20/19)...I think I essentially had a mental breakdown or panic attack. It started with apathy and numbness to the point where interactions with others felt empty and faked (like I wasn't even really there) and concluded with shaking, rapid pacing, racing thoughts, mumbling to myself, excessive crying, and just having an overall feeling like I had lost all control of myself and this spiraled down into thoughts of self-doubt, self-hatred, and even minor suicidal ideation. All of this because I have been worried about the health of one of my houseplants. 

Background time: I have a pothos ivy (named Momo after my grandmother) with marble leaves that has managed to survive three generations of people (my grandmother, mother, and myself). My grandmother has long since passed away, unfortunately, and my parents sort of took over the plant until recently when I started trying my hand at gardening. Recently, I realized that the soil in her large pot has not dried out like it is supposed to and I started getting worried. 

Unfortunately, looking up plant information is like looking up medical symptoms: you always get the worst answer because that's what most people search for. I feared that she may be at risk for root rot (which could completely kill the whole plant) and took her to a gardening center 2-3 times only for them to tell me the same thing: it isn't root rot.

However, due to how important this plant is to me and my mother, I was hardcore convinced root rot was coming. And that this plant that matters so much to us, that managed to survive three generations of a family would die, because of me. I felt like I was a failure and would constantly refer to myself as such. I felt like a disappointment, a f**k-up, someone clearly not cut out to take care of plants, and it just downward spiraled into suicidal ideation and paranoia. I was going over this plant with a fine-toothed comb, researching and looking at pictures, trying to make absolutely sure that it was not root rot. This only served to the do opposite and everything I found either convinced me it was still root rot or it was some other problem that I still needed to take her to a plant experts to get help for. It also didn't help that I accidentally crushed a new leaf and killed it while trying to transport her, and felt like absolute sh*t because of it. I literally would verbally apologize to her multiple times, telling her how sorry I was and that I didn't mean to...like someone apologizing to their dog for stepping on their tail with heavy boots. 

I finally convinced myself to stop psyching myself out with websites and pictures and decided to just...lay down and take a nap. I was probably taking this so hard because of my poor sleeping habits (I have insomnia) and just blowing everything out of proportion. So, I told my mom about how crazy I felt like I was going (very vaguely with no details) and that I was gonna go lay down. That's when the racing thoughts, mumbling, and the like started. The crying didn't start until I had actually laid down. I tried not to, but kept failing. I just left like such sh*t. It got to the point where I went from finding comfort just asking someone else to take care of her for a bit to finding comfort in MYSELF dying (not the plants but the living human that was me) because then I wouldn't have to worry about them anymore. I knew that was dumb, but I literally couldn't stop thinking about how that was an acceptable and even welcomed alternative. I was terrified but felt like such a disappointment that I felt like that was what I deserved. I deserved to just die and have someone else take better care of them because clearly I suck and should have never attempted to try. 

After crying for about an hour or two I just..stopped. I wasn't calm, I didn't go to sleep or anything, I just...stopped and just laid there as the numbness came back. It was kind of scary how quickly I went silent and numb compared to how hysterical I was before. 

I will admit, I'm doing better today. I went to work, interacted with people and actually felt something; it was a much better day. I did start off feeling empty again and I did go to the garden center again with the plant today with my mo driving because she felt I was unfit to given my mental state, just to get some peace of mind (again, overwatering but no root rot) and they told me something else I could do outside of just letting her be outside so I'm trying that and hoping it works. 

I know how dumb this might sound compared to people dealing with actual problems in life but I...I just felt so crazy and out of control. There were times when I would just scream in my head because I just wanted everything to slow down or stop even though on the outside, nothing was happening. It was just a regular Sunday of watching American Football (I'm from the USA), resting and relaxing, and spending time getting ready for Monday. 

Anyway...thanks. Have a good night and a good day.

That lead to the scariest time of my life. 
There was not much thought put into it at all, but I decided that was it. 
I was so freaking happy! I was doing moderately well in life compared to where I am now. I'm not asking why, but WHY does or why can that happen. 
Why do some people feel like once they climb a mountain they don't have to come down.

82,"so i was talking to a guy the other night. a guy friend. he was saying that those that are ""true depressed"" are trying (means, getting up in the morning, finding ways to survive, whatever) and completely invalidates other forms of having this illness. 

told him he had no right to say such things. there are many ways on how people deal with depression (including what he was saying). BUT he kept insisting-- he said that the others who call themselves ""depressed"" are just maybe ""frustrated"". and that those who took their life just lost to their frustration but they are not really depressed.

little did he know that i am clinically diagnosed with depression. and i feel completely opposite to what he calls ""having true depression"". 

fuck. i don't even have any will to get up in the morning. to do chores. to go to class. i am just so tired of fucking living and trying.

89,"Hi all,
Dont know where else i can post this, looking for some advice. If this isn’t the right place that’s okay too.
I catch the train to uni (peak-hour times in the morning) and have never had an issue. The trips are quite long but it’s never bothered me before. Yesterday I caught the train as usual but mid-way through things started to go wrong. I started getting massive hot flushes and nausea (nothing crazy, thought it might be just feeling nervous about being late) but then it got really really intense. I couldn’t speak or breathe, was sweating so much and my heart was pumping so hard, my legs felt so weak and time slowed?? like i was a bit tipsy?? I thought i was having a heart attack and started freaking out thinking i was going to die on the train and they wouldn’t be able to help me because we were underground. As soon as the train pulled up at a station i stumbled onto the platform and tried to ask for help but i couldn’t speak after getting someone’s attention. About 30m of sitting on the platform trying to calm myself down because i could barely walk i was able to get to uni. I’ve heard the symptoms are similar to those of a panic attack and was wondering if i had one? what do i do now? will it happen again? do i need to see a doctor? thankyou in advance.",22Oct2019,1
90,Hi I was recently diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and the psychiatrist prescibed me with escitalopram. The doc explained to me theside effects of this med. Is there anything else that I should worry about?,22Oct2019,1
91,"Hello, firstly I want to apologise for how this is presented, writing isn’t my forte. Anyway, I moved out of my parents house with my brother in May of this year into a small bungalow. We both have girlfriends also live here, my girlfriend pays me a bit of rent to stay each month and helped pay for furniture/appliances... my brothers girlfriend has not paid for anything including all the furniture etc.

I would have no problem with this as she is a student and is working part time, so she hasn’t got a lot of money. 

The problem is the way she acts and treats me and my girlfriend, she acts as if this house is hers and we are guests, we have had mutual friends come and they have said it’s seems like me and my girlfriend are guests. She has dominated every decision when it comes decorating the place and constantly makes passive aggressive comments when someone try’s to have an say. I hate confrontation so I just let her get on with it. 

She never says hello, she looks at me and her like scum. When it’s just me and her in the house you could cut the tension with a knife, I’ve tried to make a conversation with her and she is extremely blunt/rude so I’ve just stop bothering. 

On top of this she, like my brother do things we aren’t comfortable with like using the toilet and shower  with door open, I see her naked all the time because of this and she literally shits with the door open it’s disgusting. just last week I went to go into the toilet and she was sat there and she quickly said “get the fuck out” like fuck this its driving me crazy. 

Her and my brother have sex very frequently, which I have no problem with but she is so obnoxiously loud... it sounds like they are a watching porn video on full volume. 

She also has ocd so she cleans the house for about 4 hours a day and goes crazy over nothing, like I went for a shower the other day within 2 mins I heard her go in there saying “ for fuck sake he fucking doesn’t clean fucking anything” I promise everyone reading this there was nothing there, i quizzed my brother at work (he works for the same company about this) about this the next day and he said there a bit of fluff on the shower floor from my socks I assume. My brother is also by far the messiest in the house. 

Oh yeah they have also started growing 3 cannabis plants in our attic, I’m from the UK so this illegal. This is a rented house and me and my girlfriend have expressed multiple times how uncomfortable this makes us. When I bring it up to my brother he says “you smoke weed, this will save us money” I say it’s retarded and if he gets caught I will get it will also be me getting in trouble, our electricity bill has quadrupled since they have started this. 

His girlfriend is horrible, she has the worse look on her face when my parents  show up unexpectedly even though they paid the deposit and they are the bill payers parents but she can invite her family down for a whole day without alerting me, it’s just ridiculous I don’t get how it doesn’t bother my brother.  

We have no say on anything, the only place we sit is the bedroom to which my brother comes in all the time for no reason, all I want is to be able to relax.

Our tenancy agreement is almost up and my girlfriend and I can know afford our own place and I’m gonna be telling my brother of our intentions, I said he can have this bungalow which I know he can’t afford because she is unwilling to pay for anything. 

I’ve suffered with depression/anxiety most of my life and this is close to the worse I’ve felt also I have an illness that causes acid reflux which affects my breathing/makes my chest tight and makes me go dizzy it is amplified by stress, so I haven’t been feeling well for the last few months. I can tolerate my brother regardless of being a bit of a prick because obviously it’s my brother. But his girlfriend I’d go as far to say I hate. I’m constantly negative and depressed because of her. 

This part is not relevant but their relationship is also a joke, she acts like they are living a romance film. he has slept with 4 other people that I know of while he has been with her (they have been dating 6/7years). I would feel bad if it was happening to someone else but with her I just couldn’t tell her to spite her. 

I don’t even know why I’m writing this and I know I sound moany and petty. I just want to let other people hear what me and my girlfriend are going through and what you your opinions on how I should tell my brother that I plan on moving out? Because him and his girlfriend won’t be expecting it and will not be happy.",22Oct2019,1
92,"As the title suggests, I have no clue. I'm hoping someone can help me out with this.

A summary: I stress out and self-blame when I make small mistakes, I feel lonely all the time even though I'm often talking with others, my chest hurts a lot (frequently and agonizingly), and eating food makes me feel sick like half the time. (Note that I've had a depressive/near suicidal period for a few months when I was 15/16, but that was years ago and feels very different to whatever's happening to me right now).


The other day, I made a minor violation to the dress code at work without realizing. My boss said ""it's okay this time, but just so you know, you can't wear that here,"" which is perfectly reasonable and polite, not to mention my outfit was 95% appropriate for work and the mistake would only be noticed by my coworkers--not the guests--if at all. However, I internally freaked out, taking several hours to de-stress after the fact.

I have quite a few friends and friendly associates, and a handful of very close friends. I feel like I'm complaining to my closer friends way too often; there's always something that they've done/said that hurts me, but I'm starting to think maybe I'm the problem. I've been a toxic/manipulative friend before, and I never want to treat anyone that way again. It's hard for me to decipher whether I'm being fair in how I treat others at times... I don't want to talk about everything I'm feeling with them for fear of guilting them into treating me differently or pitying me. I don't know who in my life to talk to about my issues at all (hence coming to reddit) (by the way, talking to family is out of the question; they mean well, but don't offer guidance in this field)

There are times where I feel like I'm suffocating, at least twice a day as of late. My chest hurts so fucking bad. Today it lasted nearly 4 hours straight, while I was at work. I make an effort to be friendly to everyone and smile when I interact with others; smiling sometimes improves my mood, and laughing really helps calm the pain. It's becoming less effective; I've started to cause physical pain to my chest/sternum, which is temporary but feels so, so much better. I try to just apply pressure, but sometimes I'll just claw at/cut the skin above my heart... I know it's a terrible thing to do, and maybe I'll leave scars, but the alternative is downright unbearable right now.

Food doesn't taste as good. I used to love it, but now it's just kind of whatever. I get sick when I eat a ""normal"" amount and often go without meals. The only time I'll eat a lot is when I binge on massive amounts of junk food like chips, cookies, bread, etc

Ever since I was little, it hurts to say ""I love you"". I don't know why, I get that physical pain in my chest whenever I say it. Both my parents raised me, and they always told me they love me. And now they have to force me to say it back when I don't want to, but I feel guilty if I don't.

Getting through an entire 24 hour day is a tedious process. I usually pass the time by gaming for hours on end, as it's the only thing that will fully distract me from my own thoughts. 

I don't have hobbies anymore. I used to do so much drawing, reading, playing instruments, writing stories, bike riding. I'm just bored of everything I used to love.

Spring/summer give me energy and optimism, but my mood and health always decline in the fall/winter. There's so much cold and darkness all around me all the time. It's too much.


I want to live. I don't care if I die, but no part of me actively wants to. Not sure why, but I guess that's a good thing.


When I did want to die, a long time ago, the only reason I didn't was because I didn't want to traumatize my family. At the time, I had no friends who cared about me; I'm endlessly grateful for the ones I have now.


I don't think I have clinical anxiety, as my attacks are pretty infrequent (though I have panicked a few times in the past couple years). I don't think I'm depressed either. That suicidal period I had a long time ago was absolute hell, and my current state of mind feels nowhere near as fucked up as it was then.

If anyone has any insight to what i may be going through, please share your thoughts. I just want to figure out what's happening to me so I know how to get better.

Thank you.",22Oct2019,2

Dear Sir/Madam:

We are a team of academic researchers interested in early detection of signs of depression. The main purpose of our project is to instigate the development of automatic methods that try to learn how to link word usage to psychological problems (e.g. depression, eating disorders, self harm, etc).

We really believe that this kind of ""text mining"" research might be valuable as a complement to more traditional screening strategies. As a matter of fact, there are multiple studies that show that depression is often undetected or detected at a late stage. We think that these low ratios of early detection could be improved. At least, we think it is worth to try.

To meet this aim, we need some data from individuals who were diagnosed with depression. If you were recently diagnosed with depression, we would greatly appreciate if you could fill the questionnaire attached. It is a standard inventory of questions related to depression and used by psychologists at the earliest stages of detection of symptoms of depression. Note that the questionnaire contains a field in which the respondent has to provide his/her Reddit username. This would help us to link word use (as extracted from your Reddit's public submissions) with the level of depression (as estimated from your answers to the questionnaire).

Of course, we will treat the information you provide with the utmost confidentiality and privacy. All information we will extract from Reddit will be anonymised and we will be the only one capable of connecting your username with your postings and your questionnaire. Such information will be kept in an encrypted file and will not be disclosed to anybody.

The information you will provide through the questionnaires will enable us to properly weight each and every symptoms to enable their best identification in what people writes.

We really thank you for your time and consideration, and we hope that our activities help to gain insights into the development of depression and how it affects those who suffer from it.

94,"I kind of posted this to the BP sub, but have a different question here  TW: suicide attempt of a friend, SH mentions, sexual ""assault"" (really, idk, consent boundaries cross).
Background: I'm freshly diagnosed bipolar I and moderate functional alcoholism, currently trying to deal with my own way way ups (don't want to use the word mania, doc did but that seems dramatic), just really trying, struggling w a SH relapse and I don't know, I'm trying. This will be long winded bc I don't wanna leave shit out that matters and also I can't sleep. 
 My friend right now doesn't have clear diagnosis, docs are guessing borderline or bipolar, but anyway they're my roommates exfiance of four years who got me really really drunk a few weeks ago, had sex with w me (I don't remember anything, I think I was beyond drunk though bc I was still drunk and fucked up emotionally the next day), and so I put some space. Since then they kept telling me I was the most important person to them, they're in love w me, all types of shit even though I've said so many times I don't want to date anyone. I told them I didn't like being that drunk and if it happens again to not touch me (they had some Malibu and I had a fifth and a half of vodka, I guess).  A week ago my roommate and I talked them down from a suicide attempt, and so they turned 21 this week. I was trying to be nice even though even seeing them made me feel ill bc they don't have any friends in their town, so I invited them to come down and grab some drinks at a poetry show near my house for their bday. Before they came I texted them that I didn't want to hook up, doc said my judgement was impaired and hypersexuality makes ppl do stupid stuff, so not to push it. Apparently they told my roommate they were going to anyway  They immediately found my exgf and convinced her (drunk, sigh) to convince me to have a threesome. I told them no a bunch, and I don't blame my exgf because she didn't know the shit w the other person, she thought it was banter, bought me a bunch of drinks. Long story short, I woke up wrapped in a blanket, not remembering much and feeling very used and shitty. I haven't cried in like 18 months, but I came close when I realized. Anyway, after talking w my roommate I decided to text this person and let them know I didn't like it, I wouldn't be drinking around them again. I would've just avoided the whole thing but they're on dating apps and I don't want anyone to feel the way I did. They said okay, told me they were drunk so it didnt count, and whatever. Then we get suicide notes from them, talk em down for a couple hours, and end up having to call the cops bc they took a whole bottle of Wellbutrin and a bunch of booze. They said it was my fault because I was incapable of being in love w them (I've never been in love w anyone, really). I hate calling the cops, I never do but we're so far away and the only person there who knows them wouldn't answer their phone (their mom) bc she works full time as a nurse. I made sure the cops knew they were sick, unarmed, but volitile and they told me theyd send a cop trained in mental health shit (I talked to him, he was really nice and in his own words, ""surprisingly fuckin liberal for a pig""). The last thing they texted me was fuck you. 
The whole point of this: I should feel like shit, I should be angry and sad and upset, I feel nothing. I haven't felt anything in three months. I'm losing my mind because I can't feel sad. Can anyone help me understand this? Also, how do I know when to call the cops on a suicidal friend? It can end so bad but I know if I hadn't they'd be dead, they kept saying it was their right and their body, but with the gap between the ill mind and reality, is it? Also, how do I sort out suicide threats with traction behind them from ones that don't? Should I? When I've been my worst, I never texted people because I knew they'd call for help, I just tried, I have a hard time figuring out when they do it to get us to text them back (which they admitted to) and genuinely trying to end their life.",22Oct2019,1
95,"""Episode"" 1: Currently we are studying abroad in college and we have been dating for 2 years. However, a week ago she told me some about some past events (including sexual abuse), how she gets no love from her parents, and how school has burned her out. She also told me that she thought about suicide at least 3 times a week in high school and thinks about it once in awhile while in college. And she told me that I am the only reason keeping her alive, she can't leave me.


""Episode"" 2: Yesterday she had a free day without classes. So she spent most of the day watching Netflix and was unmotivated to start her work till late at night. Which is normal for her, but now I think is a byproduct of depression (maybe?). But the main concerning event that happened was when we were trying to sleep. She started crying and said, ""I don't know if I'll ever be happy"". But then 10 minutes later we were chatting and having fun.  Which makes me worried about how good she is at masking her depression. And possibly the effects of seasonal depression on her.

Right now I don't know what to do. I want to get somebody to help, but I feel like it's going back on her trust in me. She takes awhile to open up, it took her two years to open up to me, to her boyfriend. And she did some free counseling at our home institution, but she said she couldn't open up to somebody she didn't know well. And currently we're in Ireland and our program offers 4 free mental health consultations with experts. However, I know she needs much more than 4. And I want to get her help in America, but she doesn't have a valid Visa for America currently, so we have to go back to Cambodia to get it. Which who knows what will happen if we do that with the idea of my mistrust in her mind.

But I think there are some good signs: she's planning for the future: looking for internships, thinking about classes, money; she still does her makeup and care about cleaningness and her outfit everyday; her brother is getting married in January and her other brother is having a son in January; and I am still with her.

Basically I am lost on how to help her and if I should wait for the spring to get better help under her Visa.
I appreciate any advice.",22Oct2019,1

102,"When I was 19 I thought my life was hard and thought it was the reason why my progress was alot slower than others in my age group. But at 19, majority ( If anyone) have not done anything big with their life. Why this matters is explained in the next paragraph.

At 27, I am incredibly frustrated now. My progress still feels slow. But at 27 I compared myself to my peers. And I hear it alot people saying to not compare lives because lives are different. Which is true. But Im comparing for perspective.... Why is it now almost 8 years later my peers have progressed so much more than I have? Do I just have bad luck and is the world against me

No. The problem is within me. I have decided to get perspectice from a psycbologist to get to the root of the problem. I am so frustrated with life. I have so many goals yet keep coming into roadblocks and getting knocked back. 

I finished university. And a grad cert. But barely.

I know there is something inside me. Something dug deep in my psyche which is blocking my success. But I cannot put my finger on it. 

Its like I am purposely going into roadblocks.
I am fucking over not being able to internalize my accompishments

I am over it. I am fucking over it. 
Growing up in school was tough. Really low self esteem and confidence. I ended up being depressed at 15. 
At 17 it manifested as anger and aggression and I was out of control.
At 19 I got dianogised with a skin disease. Whatever was left of my confidence went down. I sunk into the lowest fucking form of depression I felt like I had no identity and did not exist. I was highly anxious and paranoid. I had trouble talking to people.

My psychological problems started to subside around 21. I started stepping out my comfort zone abit. My confidence went up

I finished uni at 22 and my grad cert at 23. How I did this. I have no fucking idea but my mood had definitely improved.

Ever since university I just feel like I am fucking drifting in life. I have no fucking idea what to do. I keep saying I will go back to study but I have not yet. I am self sabotaging by procrastinating.

I go to the gym and I am an avid sports goer I train to compete. However, I fucking cannot do it. Its like a mental block is in place. My mind cannot look past it . My mind cannot look past me going back to uni now being more confident then I first went and most likely being successful.Its like there is a mental block in place that prevents me from putting my fucking self out there to compete.

 And I am just fucing procrastinating because I sub consciously may feel like I dont deserve it. I look at people and it looks to me like their accomplishments are effortless and mine just take too much effort. I know based on this the fucking issue is me.

The only ironic thing is my dating/sex life is good. I am good looking according to women. Tall. Athletic.

I am so fucking sick of it all. At 25, a massive fire lit up inside me . I became ambitious more than ever. It wad like my true side had finally a chance to show after most of the depression had cleared.

But my mind is resisting. I know If I got past this mental block then the world will be my fucking oyster. 

I am fucking sick of my achievements not coming to fruition and just self sabotaging  and Im going to fix it.

I am fucking over it. I am fucking over the frustration. I am fucking over not being able to internalise success. It has caused me so much fucking anger and frustration.",22Oct2019,15

I can't process my emotions or feel them like a normal person. When i feel anything i just feel it phisically. Every emotion feels like i'm going to puke and i can't figure out what i'm feeling. Sometimes the (whatever feeling thats really bad, stress i assume) Makes me SO phisically weak. I almost puked on my desk and on my way home i nearly passed out. My forhead was burning. I DID NOT want to get home like that so i slept on a bench in the park for some time and it just... went away.

It only happens on friday (i know why, but i don't really want to talk about it.)

The feeling passes and then I feel bad about even thinking these things.

I've recognized that I can't act on these feelings, or else I'll make things worse, and I won't.  There's also certain topics of conversation that make me feel this way, ""triggers"", if you will, and I've talked with the people about avoiding talking about these unless absolutely necessary.  

My question, is when I feel this way, should I actively fight it as I feel them coming on? Or should I ask for space, not talk to the person for a while, and just let the feelings run their course and imagine the shitty things I want to do in the moment but not do them?

I started having anxiety maybe 5 or 6 years ago. Started mild then escalated. Was on Lexapro for a while which helped, then came off it and did well for a while. About a year ago my mental health took a severe turn. Self medicating with alcohol, experienced depression for the first time, along with daily severe anxiety.

Began my current treatments in April. Have a counselor who I love. My first pdoc diagnosed me with BP and put me on a cocktail of meds. Started self harming after starting meds. Raised some concerns to my doctor but she didn’t really do anything about it. Stopped seeing that doc and came off meds. Counselor offered support through this. Did alright for a bit. Counselor helped learn techniques to help anxiety.

Things started getting worse again. Saw a new pdoc last week. No BP, just generalized anxiety and depression. Started an SSRI and a benzo.

I’m just feeling pretty depressed and like I’ll always feel this way. These new meds are making me feel off, though I haven’t been on them long. I feel like a failure that I couldn’t manage without meds. I feel like a burden to a boyfriend. It feels like what is the point in trying when I always feel bad anyway? It feels like I just want to disappear into the woods and live as a hermit. Or maybe get a brain transplant.

Mostly I guess I’m ranting. It’s hard when you feel like you are trying to do what you need to be healthy and you still feel awful. I want to call into work today but am unable. So here’s to day 2 of crying throughout the workday.

It will be now 3 years since his death (He had to move from his apartment back to our house, because he spent all his money from his extremely well paid job): I was at home with him, he went to sleep to his bedroom, meanwhile I was  in my bedroom doing something, then I hear my dog barking and scratching the door to his bedroom, I told him to stop and didnt bother to look inside. When my mother came back home, she went to check on him, she screamed, so I ran to check what was happening, my father was face planted on a pillow, so I helped my mother to rotate, his face was completely blue, so...ye, (also at his funerer, I wanted to cry but I didnt). Almost everday I think about that day. I am an introvert and probably asocial too. I dont like group chats or talking much, because I get anxious when I talk to someone and some other joins to the conversation. I feel like the only one I can trust is my dog. I dont trust the rest of my family. My mother is aggresive and arrogant, she always try to scream and blame others to feel better, like blaming the family dog for not wanting for a walk. You cant talk to her without her getting angry, because she doesnt like what you are saying, like my older brother. So they constantly argue and scream at each other (my brother has pills for depression, mother has probably something too), I have few audio logs of them arguing, family sometimes argue, but I dont think that their arguing is normal. The only one I like from my family is mom's grandparents, they are nice, also know about what is happening in our family, but they cant really help.

131,"Hi all,
I have been struggling with anxiety and depression like symptoms for years now. I go in and out of the doctors trying different drugs and therapies.
For starters I absolutely hate therapy, I tried group CBT and 1-1 sessions and they have always made me worse, I can't get on with my therapists, I always feel patronised and feel like I'm being treated like a kid which just leads me to hate the therapist. It just doesn't work for me
Secondly the only drugs I have tried are all depression medications, I have been on SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, these don't really help my mood just made me a werid neutral. The anexity is the biggest problem and the depression stems from that. 
The anxiety is so overwhelming, I can't study (I'm doing my masters) as I can't focus at all, my sleep is affected, having long nights of just obsessive overthinking. I can't work anymore as I keep getting panic attacks and any sort of soical situation sends me into a frenzy. I can't seem to shut my brain off, it's just constant overthinking and with the depression alot of it is very self deprecating, it's soul destoring and I'm reaching a breaking point. 
I really feel that if I got help for my anexity it would help with everything else, yet my doctors seem so reluctant to try me on any drugs, they just try a different antidepressant. 
It's been nearly a year now since I have been to see anyone, honestly I have been smoking weed to try and calm my head and it workes but I can't study or be productive on it. My masters is really starting to suffer.

Hello Everyone, I have been confused about my girlfriends behaviour. Can you all tell me if these are the signs of toxic relationships. I’ll put down couple of points: a) She wants me to stay connected 24/7. And if I delay in replying or calling back while I’m stuck at work she starts fighting. Initially I used to explain things to her but this behaviour never stopped. I started feeling fearful if get stuck and unable to reply that I’ll have to face the fight again. She use to say stuffs like If you don’t want to talk then tell me you don’t want to talk. For this reason I started telling her in advance that I’m gonna get stuck for a while. But this has started giving me anxiety. b) Once I was in my office party she started calling and saying I’ll hop into the cab and come there. Whom you are with? I was constantly texting her and telling her my whereabouts. I just went to dance with my colleagues for while and couldn’t text. I got so pissed off with this behaviour that I too shouted at her. I started feeling suffocated. She once said I lowered my standards by being with you. I got really hurt on this because I don’t expect to hear something like that from her. With all of this behaviour I too started fighting with her often. I started loosing affection for her. She used to say something or the other and then become fine after a while saying lovy dovy things and cuddling but these fights and used to affect me a lot. And I was unable to reciprocate in the way I used to before. I have become unsure about her now.

I identify as straight, act manly, and do normal guy things like work, snack, workout, smoke weed or drink beers with friends. But my own sexual interests are uncomfortable and mysterious to me.

This matter has complicated my life - for a period I’d even stopped all my forward momentum. Visiting escorts, watching porn, compulsively masturbating has given me much grief mostly from guilt. 

What I really want is real connection , a relationship that is willing and consensual. The reality that I’ve reduced my love life to computer pixels and hurried transactions in secret disappointments my better self. 

Am I bi, should I try to date trans. Do I need to come out or something. Or sober up, get off the porn, wash my face with cold water put my best clothes on and starts socializing? Thanks for your suggestions as to why I’m so uncertain about my sexuality and lack self esteem because of all of it.

151,"Strange is, that my body still reacts to emotions and shows them, but i can't feel them myself, as i seem to have build a wall around it to protect myself. But i feel now, that i dont need/want this wall anymore, so how can i feel emotions again?",22Oct2019,1
152,"I'm in hospital at the moment having treatment for cystic fibrosis. I'm also struggling mentally with so much stuff going on in my life. I have no idea what is causing my head to be this way, but let explain what is happening:

I feel like I've got two different sides to me mentally, one is more normal but a bit clumsy and makes rash decisions. I spend my money like it's nothing but still budget for rent/bills/important stuff first. I show a lot of empathy for others and will put other people before myself. I don't get involved with any drama and such to just keep a 'peaceful' life.

The other side is uncontrollable. Triggers such as real life issues (university, money, goals) can send me down this dark spiral of feeling like I have no real meaning to life. I get crazy thoughts going through my head in no order, just one thing to another. These can be dark, violent thoughts or just random uncontrollable scenarios. 

If I'm out in public by myself I'll be on high alert for danger CONSTANTLY. If there is a conflict happening in the street, I'll know exactly what is going on. I get visions and thoughts of people violently murdering me, these are vivid and I am just walking in autopilot mode with this going on in my head. I'll cross the road to avoid being near a stranger, and quiver when I walk past if I have to and I'm feeling that anxious.

During this side of me, my girlfriend of 3.5 years finds herself not knowing what's going on and I can't explain it to her. I end up saying stuff to her that I really don't mean during these episodes (mainly just that she shouldn't be with someone who is fucked like this). I will do anything for this girl when I'm not in an episode but I can't help but feel guilty and embarrassed after it. 

The past week has been rough. I've not been sleeping. I worry too much at night and if I do fall asleep, I'll wake up not long after. I woke up at 2.30am and had a panic attack last night and I've not felt normal all day. I try to fall asleep, close my eyes and immediately forget where I even am and fall into this scenario in my head that feels SO real. Something will happen such as hearing a knocking of my cubicle door and I'll spring up and be breathing heavily, only to find out nobody was knocking. I am in serious panic when this happens. After I've calmed from the panic, I've completely forgot what just happened. I've been restless, fidgeting uncontrollably, lying in bed for the past 16hours and have only now managed to rationalize my thoughts. This feeling of panic too feels like my chest has a massive weight on it.

Ive missed out so many details because my head is just scrambled and I can't even process a straight thought. At the moment, I'm missing university due to being in hospital and am falling behind on work. I can't even try to catch up because I can't focus when I try to do it. My mind again just goes off on these tangents that end up being dark and twisted. I'm a very routine-specific person and recently moved into a house with people that don't clean up after themselves. I came from living in my own studio to this. I don't even cook for myself anymore because the state of the kitchen just triggers me to an incredible degree. 


Sorry this is so long I just need to write it out to try and process some of it. Any replies are appreciated",22Oct2019,3
153,"I apologize. I don’t know how to explain this- I have moments where I will be filled with intense rage where I will just...seriously want to harm people. I know that most people wouldn’t get upset at these things but, let’s say if someone made a better point than I did I’ll feel both angry at them and angry at myself for not doing better. Of course, I’ve never harmed someone because of this nor do I intend to- but it is annoying. It gets me sidetracked from other things. I know this isn’t normal- because I haven’t had these issues in the past and I’d say started up 1 or 2 years ago. I don’t feel wrong for my feelings though. I know it isn’t normal but I just don’t feel wrong. However, they became more frequent or extreme recently, which is why I want to talk to my doctor. I’m not sure if this is linked but, other times I’ll have intrusive thoughts which are similar, just randomly, even when I’m not filled with rage. How would you explain this to a doctor? I can’t explain this to others around me, I doubt they would understand and would actually be repulsed by this. I just don’t know what to say or how to say it.",22Oct2019,1
154,"F 19 here. I’m having extreme dissociation today (idk if that’s what I’m supposed to call it??) I’ve NEVER experienced this in my life before, I’ve had moderate anxiety in high school but nothing severe to the point where it interfered with my life. For the past month, I’ve been noticing that at random times, all of a sudden feel SUPER alien in my body and my surroundings. It’s happened twice so far but rn its very extreme. It’s never been this bad ever. Like I can’t FEEL any physical sensations on my body or like my brain won’t register that there’s something touching me?? I don’t know how to explain it, I’ve tried googling it but I can’t find anything. Idk if it’s an anxiety/panic attack or if I’m dissociating or if it’s something else. I feel like I’m floating and feel very disconnected. If something rubs against me, it feels ALIEN. Like I know it’s touching me but I don’t feel it?? I feel like my mind has floated away and I need some weight to pull it down. If I apply great pressure to a part of my body, I feel sane and here in my environment. even as I’m typing this on my phone I don’t feel my fingers, they feel tingly and I feel like I’m floating away and it’s becoming increasingly hard to concentrate.

 If anyone can please help me identify what’s wrong or what might cause it or offer any insight into this at all, I’d be extremely thankful. I don’t know how to explain it and I feel like I’m not making sense and I’m scared. 

(Also, I don’t really know what dissociating means but when I looked it up, it was the only term that could best describe what I’m feeling. What happens if a person does dissociate? Is it always linked to multiple/split personality disorders or is it a sign of other mental illnesses as well? 

Sorry for all the questions, I just don’t know what to do and I can’t reach professional help or talk to my family &amp; friends and I’m very scared so ANY information at all would be sincerely appreciated)",22Oct2019,1
155,So basically whats happening is that my mom likes to relax with alcohol and i kinda dont like it cuz its a bad habit but she doesnt care she tells me that she is older and smarter and she is my mom but clearly drinking a bottle of alc doesnt help u relax and its like going since im 12 as far as i can remember and it was always a full botle like 1l or 0.75l of wine and my mom is not big i could clearly see that she was drunk and  she drank it alone and i always told her its ruining the family and its not good for you and we had always scandals etc. i was just speaking to her about that and she always starts to cry say that she raised a monster but only thing i do is say some facts and argue with her and she just totally burns out  and other things how also bad i am and that i made some bad decisions in the past because i was kinda getting physical problems and yeah the story is kinda it i cant have normal relationship with her but i want to i want her to stop doing it but she refuses because its her relaxing and  she does what she wants and like i suggested lets go to the family doctor or something like that just to speak about our problems but she told me yeah i dont need that you are the one that has problems u need it so i dont know i try atm all my best just to make her stop it but she crys every time blames me that  i have done something wrong but i asked her what can i do better and only answer that i get is nothing and i dont know what to  do this is the story and everytime i just speak facts like its bad it ruined our family and i could understand a glass or 2 but not the hole bottle and then lay drunk on the bed and and when i see my mom in such states it kills me it destroys my heart when i was younger she was more aggressive when she was drunk like hitting me on a cheeck or smth and a loud screaming till i cryed when i confronted her but now i think im kinda older and she doesnt do that but yeah i just say facts like its bad for you and its not just 1 bottle a month like 5-6 maybe even more or  so to say 1-2 bottles a week depends when she has free days off work and tell other facts that sometime maybe you are wrong but then she just starts to rage  and attack me and i dont do anything i just stay cuz i wont hit my mom nor any other person especially if its my mom or other family member so yeah and then it ends like this i just want some thoughts on this situation cuz i cant handle it anymore just wanted to say it so someone :(,22Oct2019,1

160,"So I've recently moved to a nearby city to start university. I went to therapy when I was 23 for a year because of a traumatic event that happened when I was younger, and after therapy I took control of my life and stopped stone walling the problem. These days, I am much better off - I love the subject that I'm studying and I see a future for myself.

Now that I have more control and understand who I am, I've started shaping my life into something that I like. I've stopped drinking and partying, I've cut down on the amount of friends I have (as in, friends I've made in uni), and I spend time doing things I enjoy and which are also productive.  Now here comes the 'But':

I'm lonely, and I have no experience in dating. My dilemma is, is that I am attractive (I know this sounds big headed but I have had to come to terms with it. It frustrates me.), and I feel like I give off this confident and experienced vibe that people perceive as me being confident in dating (or words to that effect). But it's the complete opposite. I am very inexperienced at talking to anyone that I find attractive, and I'm actually quite a boring person day to day (that's not to say I'm not fun to talk to, but more that my hobbies and habits are quite 'white bread').  

A typical situation I find myself in is attractive girls staring at me, and me not being comfortable in initiating conversation with them. I'm also in my first year in Uni, and a lot of 18/19 year olds are doing this but I don't feel right in trying to date someone so young, even though I am also inexperienced.

All I want is to find someone that I enjoy talking to and spending time with (and vice versa), who I am also attracted to, and that I can get to know and love.

Side note:

There's also this underlying feeling that I will end up in a codependent relationship - as in, finding someone who also has low self esteem. Also, finding a girl who is attracted to my non-personal attributes. I am actively avoiding these situations! I went out for dinner the other day (she spoke to me and we ended up spending the day with each other - long story short, I ended contact with her) with a girl and while speaking to her I brought up the fact that my sibling has a big house. I think this is my lack of self esteem and confidence in myself, and using other things to impress her. 

I'm also losing my hair (although slowly, thank god!).

Also please criticise if I am 'big headed' or whatever :)

Thanks for reading!

161,"I’ve been struggling with bipolar depression and sever anxiety for a very long time and about 6 months ago it started to affect my everyday life like going to work. One day I was so anxiety ridden that I couldn’t get out of my car to go into work and decided to check myself into the hospital. 

After I got out I decided it was better to lie to my bosses and tell them that I was hospitalized for a physical problem, not mental. Then as the days went on I still found it very hard to go to work with a smile on my face and I broke down to my boss and told her the truth about what I was going through. 

Boy was I wrong to lie in the first place. She was and is so supportive about my mental health. She set me up with intermittent leave for a year so I can take a break from work whenever I need to so I can work on myself without fear of losing my job. 

I am doing so much better since I came out and told the truth and actually talked about my mental health. The promos and advertisements aren’t lying when they say it’s okay to talk about mental health. The more you talk about it and face it head on the better it gets. I promise.",22Oct2019,11
162,"It started as mild depression and anxiety no more than any other person would feel. The occasional suicidal thoughts and mood swings as well. It got worse to the point I could no longer find the will to do anything. I began prozac but stopped because it wasn't really doing much and there wasn't much withdrawal. I now don't recognize my face in the mirror. I see a stranger looking back at me and it seemingly is changing every time I look in the mirror, even when it isn't. I have started to have a hard time focusing on anything to the point I forget where I was and when I snap out of it it is like I slam back to reality and feel confused for a few seconds as to what I was doing. It has made driving feel dangerous. The walls also have begun to breathe, which is strange. I am reluctant to see a shrink as I have attempted to a handful of times and was never taken very seriously at all. My physician was the one who prescribed the prozac.

164,"Hi everyone :) I just discovered this sub, and kind of want to share as well. 

I grew up putting in my all. Being innocent, hardworking, kind, passionate in my interests. I loved hanging out with friends. I loved video games. Then I got unwell due to stress after entrance exams and came out of hospital a few months later. Medicine stabilised me but now I feel a sense of emptiness and pointlessness. I'm also cynical and quite bitter these days. 

I find I am doing alot of things based on social constructs. Society says it is good to get an undergraduate degree, so I try and try to get that certificate. I always wish to impress my parents, so I put on a smile and do what they say (like helping out around the house, etc when honestly I can't be fucked). 

Then behind the scenes I numb myself with porn. There is probably alot of anger underneath the layers of medicine and pain. I also can't exercise for 2 months already due to back and ankle injuries, and playing basketball and gymming was really great for me. I loved it.

Then there was a period of time where I had four 2000 word essays due around the same time and I got into a car crash which stressed me the fuck out. 

But I digress. I lay awake at night, with my good grades, upper-middle class financial position, stack of games, trading cards, and books, kind friends and family. I even have a dream to be a successful author and arguably the academic talent to pursue this dream (my grades are fairly decent). So what is wrong? I don't really feel alive but I do get bursts of inspiration to read, write, watch anime, etc. I do have a sex drive. This indicates that I do still have some happy chemicals in me yet and am not depressed. But why?

- Maybe it's a lack of sleep. 
- Maybe deep down I want a girlfriend even though I personally feel it's okay to be single. (In that way I won't have to go through monogamy and the annoyance of dealing with interpersonal relationships. Awesome!...?)
- Maybe the prescriptions' side effects are messing with my brain.
- Maybe my parents have always handed me everything on a silver platter - always cooking for me, funding me, everything. ""Just study and do what you like"". They cook dinner for me every night and support me so much, and I am lucky to have them. But I feel that I haven't been taught independence and confidence. 
- Maybe the porn watching has numbed my brain. I've dug myself into a bit of a hole for this one. Likely a contributing factor.
- Maybe all of the above.

I often extrapolate into the future. 
- ""If I'm watching porn now without much contact with girls will I be some creepy old man in 10 years? I dont want to be like that. But I also don't want to be married for the sake of it.""
- ""If I'm this cynical now what about in ten years?""
- ""Why am I here? Is it all about minimum costs for maximum benefits and pleasure?""
- ""When do I bite the bullet and book a call girl? It sounds exciting, and I'm kind of bored and tired""
- ""Why don't I feel that spark of joy and excitement anymore? (When something new comes out, something good happens)""

I think these things alot and it just passes me by. I notice that I feel less like this if I have slept well as I try and get up at 9am each day. Yet alot of the times I ask - why the fuck should I get out of bed and try? My financial situation is secure. 

Sorry for the long rant.

165,"First let me start off by saying sorry for the click baity title. I really had no idea how to phrase this better. I've been a long-time lurker (on a different account, cause shitty email provider) but at this point i really need your guys' help.   


I've been struggling with a lot of mental issues ever since i've been maybe 10, when my mom died. My dad was abusive both mentally and physically, my mom's parents were mentally and emotionally abusive drunks and while my dad's mother is a kind hearted woman she really had no idea that such a thing as mental health even existed. Over the years i developed pretty severe anger issues and was diagnosed with depression about 4-5 years ago.  


Now, the anger was a pretty good motivator . . for most things. I still struggled (and still kinda do) with my personal development . . . ' cause what's the point. Now anger used to keep me afloat with a slight tinge of reckless abandon, but things started to shift lately. Ever since i met my wonderful fiancee i've started to shift. The want for self-destruction isn't this strong, and i find myself actually enjoying my life from time to time. But the problem is, old habits die hard it seems. The anger is still here, strong as ever (now note that i've never lashed out physically, and i never will I have enough nightmares of my mom's bloodied face as a result of my dad's fits of rage to ever inflict that on someone i love) and the anxiety and paranoia which came from the constant alienation over the years. At this point it's starting to affect my health. I've had heart rate of 220 induced by panic attacks , sleepless nights, high blood sugar and high BP which all seem to go down when i get sedated.   


So here's my question for you wonderful people: How do you guys manage ? How do you control the anger, how do you push onward and better yourself? How do you get yourself to go home at night and not look around your shoulder every 5 steps? I need to do something, before my damaged mind ruins not only mine, but the lives of the person i really love.

167,"I know that what is best is to talk to someone who is an expert and I have taken my 1st step towards that, I went to the consulting center of my uni today and they said they'll email me to schedule an appointment. However, once I left I honestly felt that ... I shouldn't have gone (?) That in reality I am just overeacting and overthinking about things and behaviors that are otherwise normal. As if I'm gonna go there and the counselor will be like ""why tf is she here, she got nothing to worry about"". But then again, the fact that I am thinking it way too much feels like a problem itself. 

I don't even know what I should say or how. Basically, I can't relax. Even if I feel the slightest bit relaxed/calm it feels weird and I start thinking about it again. And I constantly think about the things I do and I'm judgemental of myself but then I say that it's just normal and it's dumb that I think so much. Even with the people around me, I feel that if I don't do certain things I am instantly a bad friend where I know deep down that that is not the case but my system can't register that. Or when I talk to others I really often get the feeling that they really don't care about what I am talking about, although again, I deep down know that that is not the case, but I can't stop feeling that way.

I constantly put myself at a bunch of things at a time, studying parallel in 2 uni's, getting staight A's, volunteering and I'm somehow not bad with people when I actually talk to them, but the idea of approaching them stresses me out a lot. Around me there are a bunch of people that care about me, but it feels that I cannot reach out to them, I don't feel that connected to them, I don't have fun when I am around them. 

People that know me say I'm too hard on myself and that I should slow down, but I can't. Cause slowing down would just make me feel worse. I know I am the one putting myself in this cycle, but now that I am into it I just can't stop, cause these 2 mins of happiness I feel when my work pays off is pretty much the only moments of positive emotion that actually reaches me. 

idk I have literally achieved every goal I've set so far and everything is perfect but nothing feels perfect. these 3 years now that I think about it must have been the worse. And it feels really arrogant saying that. 

I've seen the term ""high functioning anxiety"" around the internet and I found a lot of things about it relatable, but of course I can't be the one to judge.

[what I look like now](https://imgur.com/a/HVq7TFG)


When I was 16, I had this older guy take advantage of me at a party with his friends. They were both 18. Afterward, they ignored me and bragged to their friends, calling me gross. His younger brother was in my grade, and his friends bullied me too before that happened. I had no social media, and they would make posts about how I looked old and that I'm a fat slut.




They would pick apart my features every day. My lips are too thin, eyes too close together, man jaw, prominent chin, and that I was the ugliest girl in school. I moved away at 18 to a new state; it's been four years since all this happened. The guys in my grade would ask me for sex but tell me not to tell anyone because I was so ugly.



They would say no man will ever want me. They said I'm attractive enough to sleep with but not to be seen with me. . They would say I'm the grossest girl in school, and any guy who sleeps with me is desperate. They would greet me by telling me I have wrinkles all over my face that I had peeling skin. I was so disgusting I burned and deleted all the photos from school.

173,"My flatmate is very nice person but I find them extremely frustrating. This person LOVES to talk non-stop while I'm more introverted.  We're at uni, and I have a lot of work to do as does this person. However, in all honesty, they're absolutely not serious about their education or career whereas I'm very seriously preparing for grad school right now. That's fine, personal choice. But this person is extremely clingy and has no sense of space whatsoever. First off, they are constantly and loudly complaining about how much work they have but they never actually get around to doing it. Then this person randomly comes into my side of the room to talk about their personal life (which is all the time) when I really don't have the time to listen to them. We sometimes split the cooking and I finish off my part quickly and without any help; when this person is doing their share, they ask me to do little things - fill the pot with water, clean something that's spilled etc. We sleep in different rooms (fortunately) but every morning when this person wakes they play music on their phone without using headphones. Once this person woke me up at 6 am when I intended to sleep longer because they can't handle feeling lonely. They tell me to wipe the water off the sink using a washcloth but when I tell them that their dirty dishes have been lying around for 2+ days, this person bursts into tears and goes on about how difficult their life is. According to them, I'm a ""close friend"" but I really don't think the same. The few times I share something, they don't actually remember it and they're very quick to change the conversation to something about them.

So here's the most frustrating aspect of this ""relationship."" I know this person is going through something  and I've told them countless times that they should seek mental health support or counseling. I go through this myself, can completely empathize with them, and have even offered to accompany them for their appointments. I feel terrible saying this but this person has little resilience or focus and every time they experience a stressful phase, you have no choice but to counsel them. I, personally, tend to deal with my issues in isolation but I also understand that not everyone is the same. However, this isn't 30 minute thing. I feel terrible even saying this but it takes me some 30 mins to calm them down and another two hours to make them feel better about themselves. Each time, this person resolves to be more responsible and not let uni stress overwhelm them; every time, this person promises to seek professional help. However, when I get back to them about it, they respond with ""Oh, I'm feeling much better actually haha!"" I completely understand it's not easy to seek mental health support; I've done it but I also know that my family was supportive about it. Fortunately, the uni offers a wealth of resources for this purpose and they are free in the sense that these services are covered by a school-offered insurance. I'm getting annoyed because their reluctance doesn't really solve anything. To me, this translates to a lack of initiative, responsibility, and the sense that ""if anything happens my flatmates will handle it."" I honestly feel like I'm living with a ticking time-bomb and it has exacerbated my own mental health issues a hundred-fold. Even when I find them getting a tiny bit stressed or emotional, I panic and take over the chores because I can't deal with anything more drastic! What if this happens during my exams? or worse, the finals? I've overcome many challenges to be here and I have certain objectives that I really want to achieve!  I have compromised my sleep and my work and my parents are putting in 50k a year for this! 

Again this is genuinely person and everyone around me thinks so as well but even their voice has started to on my nerves these days because my only experience of them is me filling the pot with water because they want to make this ""amazing"" gnocchi or pushing aside my work because they need to feel better about themselves. If I tell them something, I'm afraid they'll spiral out again (as they did when I told them the dishes), so I choose to suffer silently.  What I don't understand is that no one else looks concerned or even mildly irritated about this (including the people who room with them) and that makes me feel like I'm the only heartless person for thinking of them this way!",22Oct2019,1
174,"I am 18 year old trans guy living in Lithuania- extremly homophobic and transphobic country, and the country highest rates of suicides in the Europe. Coming out is not an option, people will eat me alive, however, I do my best to look like a guy anyways. This, here, apparently is.not accepted. 
I have a friend who is also a trans guy, it is a miracle that I met this person, we became best friends, close like brothers. I will call him William.
Let me describe my daily life and encounters with people. I live in a grey, dark building like most of the buildings in lithuania. I will show you how it looks like, taken from Google. https://ibb.co/1QWsHjc
My mother and father are both alchoholics, I haven't seen them sober in a long while. While I feel bad for my mother sometimes, I hate it when she drinks. I could never make a piece with people who drink alchohol, I swore on my life to never drink a sip of that stuff just based on the fact that I grew up surounded by drunk people. I can't trust them. Drunk person is a different human being. I remember in my childhood memories I would always ask my drunk mother obvious questions like 'what's your name' or 'how old are you' just to make sure she is the same woman. 
My father doesn't care about us (me, my sister and my young brother). Maybe he does care about his youngest son, but barely. All his does is drink and watch Tv, all day long, All night long. He also works, I give him that, he supports the family by buying us food, paying the taxes and sometimes giving us 5€ for our personal use. He also is in deep deep debts, owning a bank quite a lot of money. But he never cares about how we are doing. I was never close to my father, quite the opposite, we argue a lot. 
I used to go to therapist for anxiety and Paranoia. I stopped going because I was soo anxious to go. I also have depression. Its scary to think where it can lead me Suicide is not the worst thing even, I am just scared of missing the opportinities and living here for ever, regreting everything. There are some better days, but I am are not happy or even close. It just feels a bit more managable, like you can wake up instead of doing nothing. Its not even lazyness. Its nothing like lazyness. You want to do it, and you are not even against it, you just physicly or mentally think you can not handle it at the moment, like if you go, you don't care if you just lay in the middle of the school, crouch the legs and sleep just to be away. And it used to be different. My anxiety would take over and i would need to do it, but now i feel like I can be axious all i want, I just can not do it. I want to read a books or watch a movie, but what is the point, I can not do it.
Today my neighbour stopped me when I went to the shop (I do not know any of my neighbours, not the names or faces, I have never spoken with them) and told me that people in the neighbourhood think that I am a lesbian. It hit me hard. People now are looking at us, me And William, listen to our conversations (We speak in english and hope to move out one day, but we have 0 money and work as an artists). They judge us. I do not know what to do. The neighbour woman was speaking right intk my face, her drunken breath was making me sick, she wouldn't let me go home, holding me by the arm. I had to mental strenght to say anything to her and she barely stood on her two legs of how drunk she was.
My parents do not think  that depression is a thing. They think I do it to bring attentiom to myself, and that is the last thing i want to do. It is getting worse each day. I can not manage my feelings on my own, I am too scared. Suicide seems like a prettiest way out.",22Oct2019,1
175,"I've only seen 3 or 4 people mentioning that they experience this. I've seen a few on reddit and another on a mental health forum. No one is able to give a clear answer other than possible PTSD from sexual abuse.

It started when I was younger, I think a little before puberty. I would feel this random wave of pure disgust or ""ickiness"". It would be towards myself, other people around me, everything. It would fade in about a minute, but it would leave me unsettled for a few hours.

It feels like a type of sexual shame but I wasn't sexually abused when I first began having this feeling. It also feels very disconnected, like an unconscious switch goes off. If I recall correctly, touching or accidentally brushing my nipple would sometimes trigger this feeling. 

It's been many years since I had experienced this but today, working at my computer, I suddenly had that wave of shame/disgust but there was no trigger for it. I'm on epilepsy and depression medications and have been for several years. 

Does anyone else experience this or have any explanation?",22Oct2019,1
176,"The past week or 2, I've been having trouble thinking/analyzing situations. I've been very angry/depressed, so maybe that has been a problem. I've also been off my SSRIs for a week. Maybe also food &amp; water? I haven't been feeling great today so that might be part of it. It's so hard to maintain a train of thought, analyze issues, analyze complex interpersonal drama and diplomatically navigate issues, etc.",22Oct2019,1
177,Sitting in my psychiatrist's office an hour and a half after a major anxiety attack. He plays classical music instead of a white noise machine. The song playing as I came in was a cover of 'We Will Rock You'. It's oddly empowering for someone who's shaking like a leaf from stress.,22Oct2019,3
178,"I think sometimes I feel really bad, mainly because of some time things I consider problems in my life. Problem is I have tried to talk to my parents but I have no idea how to explain my problems and just break down. I don't know what the best thing to do is.",22Oct2019,1
179,"I honestly have no idea how to explain it properly. Usually I'm fully aware everyone around me is real. Just a couple of minutes ago, I was looking something up on Google when I suddenly had a warm fuzzy feeling in my head before the thought ""everybody around me is as real and complex as I am"". I'm usually aware of this and wouldn't normally think too much about a realisation like this but for some reason I just can't stop thinking about it and I just feel the need to tell somebody. I have been having poor sleep lately. I have insomnia and its been significantly worse recently, causing me to not feel tired until about 4am. Maybe poor sleep has something to do with it?",22Oct2019,13
180,"My father died 2 years ago, I was 13 at that time. I remember the night it happened vividly, especially when they've brought his body downstairs (he died in his bed, out of the blue, probably a stroke, paramedics couldn't save him). I've fallen to my knees and the pain I felt was out of this world. I don't think that anything could compare to that. The feeling was absolutely overwhelming, all of my emotions got out this moment, right there. I tried to scream, couldn't really make any loud noise, but the effort was excruciating. The thing is that I don't really remember grieving after that. I cried at the funereal, but other than that I can't think of anything else. I don't even remember being sad. I don't really remember much at all, only the song that I listened to when we drove to his hometown (for the funeral) and back. (It was ,Delilah' by Florence, the words ,cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine, but maybe not tonight' stuck with me to this day).

 I also remember focusing on the things I hated about him. I hated that he was was a drunk. I remember when I was 11 or 12 and we were on holiday. He got drunk everyday, also when we were on holidays and he should've looked after me more. One time I had to basically drag him from a restaurant to our room through the whole resort, at night. I remember being terrified when I tried to take his camera, because he fell and it was expensive and I remember being afraid that it would brake, but he yelled at me when I tried to do that. I also remember him being heavy and it was hard for me to keep him up. He apologised the next day and said that it would never happen again, but he said that before. I know that addiction is not a choice, but for god's sake he had a son to take care of, he could've at least tried.

He wanted to be a good father. He thought that money and expensive holidays were the way to go, but I didn't care. His money doesn't matter anyway right now, as my mom is struggling to provide for me after his death.

Anyway, I guess that I've tried to focus on the negatives to make his death easier for me. Probably  not healthy, but worked well I guess.

To the point : I don't think I've cried about anything since the funeral. I long for that pain that I felt the night of his death. I want to feel it coming out of me and trying to scream but not being able to. I dream about having an amazing relationship only for a guy to hurt me and make me miserable. This is really messed up but I can't help it. Right now it's not causing me any problems, but I'm afraid about subconsciously sabotaging my future relationships so I could feel that pain. 

I'm desperate for a boyfriend who I could fall asleep in his arms because I would feel safe, which would be an extremely huge deal for me. I have a very strong sense of personal space, both physical and mental. I'm never vulnerable with anyone and I long for that person who I could be with. Sure, I'm just 15 and I roll my eyes (not openly of course, I'm not a horrible friend) when my friends tell me about their ,relationships' and I know that nothing serious could happen at my age, but sometimes I just lie on my bed and feel empty and cold inside because I just really want for a guy to hold me in his arms so I would feel that everything would be alright. I guess that I'm also afraid that I won't be able to really, fully open up to someone. I hide things like this from my closest of friends, so will I ever be able to meet a person who I could be absolutely vulnerable with? (I'm a gay male btw). 

Could the not being - able - to - open up thing be coming from me shutting my emotions out to heal myself after my father dying? 
How to I stop longing for that horrifying pain? Does the need for this pain come from closing myself up and not really grieving? How do I satisfy my need for safety and being open with someone at an age (15) of not being able to actually meet someone I could form a serious relationship with? 

Sorry that it all came out so chaotic, but as I was writing this I realised that I'm more broken than I thought, so that's always fun. Thanks to anybody who stayed till the end and I would really appreciate any advice on what should I do.",22Oct2019,1
181,"so, last year in school I made massive steps forward with my depression and anxiety, my OCD, ADHD, and dysgraphia were still troublesome but had limited effects on my social life (which was the most stable and healthy it had ever been) and my unweighted GPA ended up being 3.9, so it can't have hurt my school life that much. fast forward to September and half my friends graduated, my sensory processing disorder is making more trouble for my life than it has since elementary school, my ADHD and OCD are getting worse after years of therapy and my depression and anxiety are now on par with the previous lowest time. a few good things happen, I got into a civics course I wanted, I got a boyfriend (who has been helping me through this year), and I got back onto a regular weekly therapy schedule. but the worst of it started. now, usually I burn out in spring, and while I'm never fully recovered by the end of summer, im usually able to do about as well as I did in late winter the previous year. this year I burned out in late September. my current GPA is 2.6, below the national average, and I relapsed with my trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling). my mother has blamed my laziness and lack of focus for my slipping grades. i am always tired, my ability to function in classes is disappearing in front of my eyes, I can barely get myself out of the bed in the morning, and I just don't know how to move forward.   


sorry, I just needed to rant to someone, a faceless mass of internet strangers is as good as someone in person. I just need to get my thoughts out, not suffer in complete silence.

182,"hi  I don't know if this is the right sub for this but i'm looking for help with how best to support my friend with her mental health problems,

She's pretty open about issue's with anxiety and fears of being abandoned by freinds (partially caused by issues with previous freind groups) but has reccently told me about issue's she's facing/ has faced with self-harm,  starving herself, feeling worthless and like she doesn't deserve to be  where she is (middle class whilst the majority of her friendship group  is working class, by the sounds of it, since we go to different schools  and i haven't had much of a chance to meet her freinds within her school  as i go to the school next door and can't talk during school time to  them), she belives some of these issues might be due to BPD but hasn't  got diagonsed with it yet due to therapy wait lists being long, as well  as not being on the best terms with her mum about discissing her issues,  she hasn't told familly anything except that she struggles with anxeity  due to her mum not beliving her at all, her mum has only just allowed  her to get therapy due to starting to be physically sick .

I  personally have some issues with anxiety and being able to communicate  how i feel to others although she's probably the person i feel most  comfortable with in this regard, but i really want to help the best way i  can, but all i feel i can do is tell her it's okay that she feels that  way and that I'm always here for her to listen or help, as well as tell  her it's okay if she can't go cold turkey with cutting herself straight  away and that she shouldn't beat herself up as she'll only feel worse,  and ask her in the future to either message me or someone else when she feels like doing it or just needs to get something off of her chest, to  try to make her feel better and to try some of the alternatives suggested (like ice, elastic bands or making it a challenge to hold off  as long as possible untill hopefully the urge passes), I've also let her know that when her and another friend stay round (who she's comfortable with knowing just hasn't told yet) on thursday she can can wear a short sleeve t-shirt and no-one will say anything and have obviously had a conversation with my dad about it (just base level, no details) who's in the house so he's not surprised and doesn't make a comment, so to get to the point, how best can i support her?

sorry for the wall of unorganised text, tbh i just want to get this out there and i can't organise this well right now

184,"I recently went through a traumatic time and ended up in the psych ward (this is work stress + bad meds mix induced but I also have PTSD from events in childhood and my fathers suicide 3 years ago).

I was discharged relatively quickly but then put into an outpatient program, which I love and want to complete. 

I am using my companies leave policy to my advantage but soon will only be eligible for 1/2

So, I have turned to GoFundMe to ask friends and family to help out... but it’s stalled and the response has been mixed. I would much rather sell my ceramics and other projects on Etsy to make up the funds but the insurance company was very clear that any additional income puts my current benefits at risk.

I feel incredibly insecure and I hate myself, I can’t think of a single positive thing about myself anymore, I can’t be proud of anything I’ve done, I don’t even know what I like, if you asked me that I wouldn’t know how to answer. I feel incredibly uncertain about my future and it gives me anxiety. I’m constantly in anguish because of my uncertainty about my sexuality, and why I can’t be attracted or interested in anybody, or why I don’t want a girlfriend but want a boyfriend yet simultaneously can’t find any guys interesting (look at my post history for more information). I desire being in love again so much yet I can’t find it. My old friends from home who I play with on Xbox are sometimes assholes. My parents are sometimes assholes, despite always being loving and supportive of me. Worst of all I lack any motivation to do anything. It takes hours to complete the simplest task. I move lethargically and find it difficult to concentrate, and although many have suggested ways to make myself feel better I never follow through.

Well she went to my school and my parents were notified.

Don’t know what else will change.  I also have to see a psychiatrist tomorrow and get cleared to go back to school.

Digestion basically stopped working, random infections all over my body, chronic migraines and insomnia. I cut out gluten, but continued treating leaky gut syndrome for many years - which I'm not convinced was entirely from gluten recovery. Doctors never helped and I recovered on my own, slowly.

196,"I have commented about this on different posts here and there, but I really wanted to make its own post. I am a freshman in college right now, and throughout all of high school, up until now, I have had depression to some extent that has gone up and down over the years. I had a girlfriend through most of high school, we loved each other, we were really close, we were planning on getting married, and she was really honed in on helping me, and making sure we were both happy, and that going into college I would see a therapist to get help, (which I currently am). I was incredibly anxious going into college, thinking that she would break up with me. One day, she asks me to have an open relationship, because she was feeling super afraid of commitment because I was her only boyfriend through all of high school and she wanted to experience dating life. I wasn't really ok with it, and my first mistake was just saying yes because it was better than breaking up, which honestly, it was. But this break, had no limits, no boundaries, just whatever she wanted to do, because I was not really up to do anything with the open relationship. I find out a week later, after no communication, which was also a bad thing to have, that she had sex with another guy almost immediately after we started the open relationship. I know I shouldn't have been hurt because I agreed to it. But I was, and I knew I had to tell her. So we talked, and eventually it led to us breaking up. I feel like everything I had been told over the years, that had slowly led to me getting over parts of my depression were crushed, it's been almost 2 months, and I still feel the same as when we first broke up. I still go every single day feeling hopeless, crying almost every night and I feel like I have nobody right now to tell me things are going to be ok. The therapy I've been in, hasn't been helping too much, but I know it will at some point. I just really don't know what to do anymore, I'm feeling really hopeless about life and I feel like I have no more motivation to keep fighting my depression and to just let it take over me. This is also a lot because I know that part of the reason we broke up was because of my depression, and that she just couldn't really take it anymore. Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated.

198,"So ever since last year in 8th grade I started to become really self conscious and my self esteem started to drop and it was my first time i ever felt depressed at all really. That was about a year ago and throughout that school year I would just have like depressive episodes that gradually got worse but at first they were only a few days out of the week. I was never suicidal, I’m still not, but I just felt really down and like I would never be good enough. When I was with friends I was distracted from it but when I was alone and left with my thoughts it got really bad.  It’s hard to explain how I feel/felt and it sucks because when I’m around people I like, like my close friends and family, I’m happy and energetic and I’m always joking, but when I have these episodes it’s just the exact opposite and I have no energy and just feel down. It’s usually triggered by small things like looking in the mirror too long and paying attention to the things I don’t like. It just jump starts everything. It’s also triggered by school or when I’m stressed or have anxiety. So then summer came around and I guess I had less episodes. But I was with friends a lot and I slept till 4 every day so there wasn’t really time to feel bad. That’s when my insomnia started to get bad tho. I gradually stayed up later and later. Normally 2 or 3am is normal for kids to go to sleep during the summer, and for me too, but it got to the point where I was going to sleep at 7am every morning and sleeping all day long. But there were definitely a handful of times I had episodes. So this school year rolls around and it gets worse again, except it’s gotten more persistent and I have an episode at some point during the day at least 5/7 days I would say, sometimes less. I’ve always thought of depression as being suicidal and really really sad constantly and since suicidal thoughts and self harm have never been an issue of mine I always thought “oh well it’s not bad enough to be depression” I was never educated on mental illnesses but over the past few weeks I’ve been looking up stuff and I noticed a lot of my symptoms line up with persistent depressive disorder, 1. I have lost interest in my hobbies, I used to dance for years and I loved it, but last year when I started to get these symptoms dance was what triggered it most, i felt like I was Bad at it and wasn’t improving, I hated going and being there, there were time where I would cry about it and take naps and sleep in so I could miss it on purpose. This was still when I could never fall asleep during the day. I slept all night I could just never take naps. 2.I have terrible insomnia. I have basically done a full 180 from my past habits, i never sleep right. I wake up throughout the night and can never get tired until like 1am and I have to be up at 6am. So then I’m tired all day, yet I have no problems taking naps during the day for hours. 3. multiple depressive episodes a week, basically what I’ve explained so far. 3. weird appetite, it’s not my biggest symptom but i either go for hours without eating or am constantly snacking. But weight gain or loss isn’t a symptom. 4.low self esteem, by far the biggest issue. I hate myself and feel like Theres just nothing worth while about me. 5. fatigue, I assume from the lack of sleep. Btw when I say “episodes” I mean like just feeling down and bad about my self for a good portion of the day. And I haven’t had a break from feeling that way for more than 2 months in between, a week or two at most during the summer but during the school year it’s at least multiple times a week, Anyway it doesn’t really have an a effect on my school work but it had an effect on things that need to be done at home, because I have no motivation, things like cleaning and stuff that just doesn’t require that much effort, and it’s also had an affect on my social life. Most of my social situations are at school and I’ve always had social anxiety and school triggers my symptoms so it makes it difficult. It’s pretty much normal to me now and while I type this I think back to the times where I’m happy and I just feel like I want to feel like that all the time, you know. I’ve always just assumed it’s normal for everyone else and I just have to deal with it. Or that if I were to bring attention to it, it would just be viewed as me being over dramatic because I dont like school or doing chores, which I don’t like but it’s just different when you feel like that. I would just like to know from some people who experience stuff like this what your take on it?, is it normal, is it nothing, is it something I should have checked out. Or am I just going through a phase that all teen go through. I’m 14 btw. I would really like to know because it seems to kinda be getting worse as time goes on and my anxiety is kinda getting worse as well, and at the moment it’s manageable, but I would like for it to stay that way and not get out of hand. I would also just like to be happy more and be able to enjoy life more. Sorry it’s so long I just feel like I need to get everything out there.

200,"When I (and most people) think of PTSD, I think of army vets who have seen terrible things, or people who were abused as children, bad bad stuff like that. I have an event in my past that wasn't nearly on those levels, or even close, but I still think about it almost every day, mostly at night when I'm trying to sleep, and I have nightmares about it. Again, this is something most people would consider trivial (I won't go into specifics), but It caused me a lot of anxiety and distress at the time, and still does, 5+ years later. I hesitate to call it PTSD, and I wouldn't do so out loud, as it would be embarrassing to me and disrespectful to those who have been through ""real"" trauma, but I don't know how else to classify it. There's gotta be a better classification for what I am experiencing. I don't know how to get over it, I can't seem to do it (any advice? Talk therapy is a good start). Obviously in my mind it wasn't a small or unimportant event, but if I told someone about it, they would likely say ""so? what's the big deal?'

201,"I was hoping to get some opinions here. My boyfriend is 25 (we’re the same age) and there are some behaviors I’ve noticed that have me kinda concerned about his mental well-being. I’ll cut to it, some of the things I’ve noticed:

-he has really noticeable mood swings. Sometimes he’s really jovial, outgoing, a real life of the party type. But later that same day he will just be completely down in the dumps. Literally just be sitting in one spot, not speaking, not really listening. Just...switched off, almost. If I try talking to him about anything during these times, I’ll get the most bleak answers you could imagine.

-he seems to “zone out” all the time. Even when we’re surrounded by people who are talking, he will often just end up staring into space, completely detached from everyone around him. He’ll only realize it when someone repeatedly nudges him or loudly says his name a few times.

-he gets really startled when someone unexpectedly calls him or touches him. If we’re in public and someone calls his name, he practically jumps out of his skin.

-he gets nightmares, all the time. The kind where he sits bolt upright in bed in a cold sweat. When I ask, he says he doesn’t remember what the nightmare was about.

-sometimes, most often when we’re around others people, he seems to be on edge. Like he’s anxious about something, maybe even angry. I’ve seen veins sticking out on his face and sometimes seen that he has his fists clenched.

-on a few occasions, I’ve noticed injuries on his hands which I strongly suspect came from hitting stuff. When I ask, he says he dropped something, bumped into something etc. He’s never shown a shred of violence in front of me though.

-he dives into really random hobbies, often spending a fair bit of money and doing a frankly bizarre amount of research on these hobbies. He’ll drop it after a few weeks or so and move on to something else, but will eventually circle back. Then rinse and repeat. It’s not like any of his friends are participating in these things with him...it’s just him by himself.

-he has never outright said that he wants to commit suicide. But he has said many things which strongly imply that he thinks life isn’t worth living. He usually says these things very quietly and flatly, almost like he’s saying it for his own benefit rather than to someone else.

As far as I know, he’s had a fairly normal upbringing. He is an engineer and has a good job. I don’t know of any major traumas he’s experienced. I’d like to talk to him about this, but I really don’t know if I’m just overreacting here. Should I be concerned or is what I’m describing more less normal?",22Oct2019,1
202,"I want to take 2 months and go to a mental health inpatient program to get my mind right.  Currently take Effexor daily (75) but my anxiety is crippling.

Please just help me.",22Oct2019,1
203,"I feel unable go to sleep at this moment, although it’s already 4 hours past what's normal bed time for me. My head is spinning, yet hurting me with thoughts. I have a gut wrenching feeling and I don't know if sleeping at this condition would be of any help or even be possible. 

I have to take what's probably one of the biggest decisions of my 22 years of life. I don't want to get into the details regarding what specifically the decision is about. I'll rather vent in terms of the feelings it bounds me with.  

Maybe decision is the wrong word. I have lost control over this situation. I will have to, or be forced to, let go of something I hold dear. When I let go of it, I'll lose my identity. I'll not be the same person anymore. 

Usually I have the mindset that, when a door closes, another door opens. This time, I have already passed through so many doors, ending up in such a peculiar opening where closing this door would be equivalent to killing the current me, the me I struggled so hard to find - the me I had made peace with, the version I would love to be. 

Emotionally, financially, in terms of making dreams come true, or in any other way, this letting go is going to cost a lot. 

I have my back against the wall. I am being kicked out for something that's not my fault, and nobody can do anything to help. 

I had struggled with so many things in past, yet nothing seems strong enough compared to this moment. I had to deal with seasonal affective disorder, mild depression, sudden traumatic events, etc., but now I am at a point where the life of the identity of the current me is dangling in front of sure death. 

This would mean that I would never become the complete me, going through the paths with all the hardships and privileges there were. Others, disbanded, would keep going on, with me as the casualty. 

They say life never goes as planned, but that's a phrase I already have seen too many proofs of. None of them costed so drastically, forcing me to let something so great go, completely destroying me and my identity. 

It feels as if, despite so many potentials at hand, someone is forcing me to become the worst possible couch potato version of me, whereas the best possible door was just open in front of my face. 

Such drastic shift at such crucial cornerstone of my journey can make me fall from a hard-gained height to a deep abyss. The sea of happiness would alter into the sea of darkness. The hero would choose and become a scum. 

When this door closes, the door that would open would be the door to utter uselessness in terms of how the current me would have been useful in the field chosen after so hard a search from inside and outside. 

At least it won't be the current me anymore who goes through that door. 

I had switched paths so many times, finally believing that I've settled. One last blow was all that was left. Minus me, it will still happen, to others - the others the current me could walk together with in the future, both near and far. 

Too cruel this world has been for many people. I wish this world apologised someday. 

The world would keep spinning no matter how many people dies. 

It doesn’t care about who lives, or who lives as who. 

Or what a person gives or receives. 

It doesn’t matter to the earth. 

It matters to the people involved - the people who cannot be avenged or reclaimed from this unapologetic earth - the people who cannot get what they pay for, or get to exist as what they could live to be.",22Oct2019,2

205,"Now I know most of the time you end friendships if someones view is really different from yours, but in my case I live with my friend. 

Usually we get along until certain topics come in and our views are just not on the same level. When it comes to my career, I don't like when people say they have doubts or that if it doesn't work out (didn't even start my new job yet, even) have this fall back plan that has nothing to do with the job. I'm pretty sure my friend is pessimistic while I'm more tenacious. 

I noticed for some time (which I had hoped it wouldn't progress, but I need to find a way to deal with this person before I move out and see where to go next) that my friend just does not say positive things when it comes to views on people in relationships, careers, learning new things. When I show pictures of me meeting new friends, my friend doesn't look at it as if I had fun at the event, it's more about attacking how someone looks in the photos. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it's about relationships, it's ""oh I doubt I'll get a girlfriend, because none of these dates want me after 1-2 dates"". ""If the date stops messaging me, well screw her, made me waste my time""... I try to mention to date other people and not stay so focused on one person that isn't even exclusive yet, and while my friend might not agree with me I left it alone after a while. But the way he talks about my career is just like I want him to shut up, and not give me his point of view which I mentioned about two times to not share that with me. He kind of disregarded it, and now that pisses me off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying my best to think of possible ways to not be as available as a roommate, and to not share certain topics (which seems like it might be a bit difficult because my friend seems to talk badly about everything). For example, if I ask how their day was, the response is usually either ""not so great"" most of the time, it's very rare to hear that it was a good day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do besides distance myself from my roommate (I have to wait a while to move out, that's another option and a whole different topic too)? I'm looking for ways on how to not have this become my distraction in my current life, I've been through enough crap as is before. My goal this year is to protect my mental health for sure.",22Oct2019,1
206,"Kinda a rant and kinda want someone to tell me that it’s okay to off myself.  Yes I posted this in another subreddit, but idk, maybe getting a reply will help me feel better? Idk.

Obligatory trigger warning I guess: When I was 19 I tried committing suicide at my university library study room. Someone should have told me that overdosing wasn’t as easy as it sounded because someone found me and called 911. Sorry to that person, probably would have been quite the scene.

Anyways, I’m five years older. Experienced a lot more of the world, traveled, graduated, had some relationships, currently talking with someone (but I’m sure they’ll stop once they realize I can’t land a decent job) and for the most part, everyone thinks I’m fine. Tried going to therapy, but it wasn’t for me. Same with antidepressants. Thankfully, my watcher (I think that’s what they’re called?) from the time I was in the hospital told me if I wanted to get out of being sent to a mental institution was to say I was just stressed out and that I accidentally took one too many caffeine pills. So I did and the attempt wasn’t put on my permanent record. Had to regain my parents trust. But the ‘friends’ I had at the time didn’t really care what happened. Woohoo. Started community college near home, got a 4.0 that semester, moved to a different city, transferred to a ‘better’ uni, put myself out there more, kicked the antidepressant addiction, joined a fraternity, made a solid group of friends, gained a dependence to weed and alcohol, worked in multiple labs during the summer, and when I graduated, I traveled to the country I wanted to see the most and kicked the weed and alcohol dependence. Got a job after working as a cashier at a Walgreens, then got a tech position at my old uni that I transferred out of, quit that, signed up to teach abroad, left after a day due to a mental breakdown and now here I am. Great right? Yea, I did what everyone said and now I’m in the same position. Exercising and being active? I lost 20 lbs in the last three months and still don’t feel better about myself. Just texted the ex I broke up with a few weeks before going abroad to teach. No reply, not that she’s entitled to reply. Just told her that I’m back and that she was right, I felt alone and wasn’t able to stand being in that situation. Friends still think I’m in another country because I can’t work up the nerve to tell them that I’m a coward. Going to tell them that I came back soon because of issues with the school. 

But anyways, currently, I’m a 24 yo, staying at home, applying to jobs in my field with no real hope of getting a good job. Parents are probably looking at me as a disappointment. Talking with someone who’s not going to be interested after they realize I’m a dumbass. Gave it five years and feel even worse than before. Thoughts are creeping in slowly again.

I was in a mentally abusive relationship 10 years ago. The condom broke when we were having sex and he didn't tell me. I ended up pregnant at 16 and he didn't want to support me. He stole from me and was on drugs. So I decided to have a termination. I didn't take the decision lightly, but felt that it was the best decision at the time. 

I'm now in this monthly cyclical habit of beating myself up. Could it be anything to do with the termination? Is it the fact I'm slightly overweight?

212,"Honestly I don’t remember much of my life before her. I grew up with her. From when I was 8 years old to 21 she’s been in my life. She’s been with me through everything. I’ve battled depression, anxiety, and OCD for a long time. She’s the only one who’s been there for me through it all.

I go to school 12 hours away from home. The past few years i’ve only been able to see her on college breaks and over the summer. Every time I’d say goodbye to her, I feared it would be the last time. I knew it was going to happen someday, but I really feared not being able to say goodbye in her last moments.

I saw my dog less than a week ago over fall break. I told her I would see her so soon, that we would only be apart 6 weeks and then I’ll be home again. I told her I promised I’d see her then. She slept in my bedroom every night while I’ve been away at school, waiting for me to come home.

She was almost 13. I don’t know the whole story about what happened but my parents had to take her to the vet yesterday because she couldn’t walk. They put her down. They didn’t even tell me until after. Didn’t think to call me and let me say goodbye so she could hear my voice again.

I had been studying for a huge exam for 2 weeks. The exam was today, I missed it. My professor is letting me make it up tomorrow, but there’s no point in even trying. I’ve tried studying twice today. I can’t do anything but stare into space. I give up. I feel like I should give up everything.

I’m so angry. I have no one to talk to. I refuse to talk to my roommates, because last week they made a joke that she was “still alive but barely breathing”... which I did not think was funny. I refuse to talk to my parents, because they put her down without telling me until after. They never let me call her to just say goodbye or have the chance to fly home. I refuse to come home for thanksgiving because I cannot look them in the eyes. I can’t talk to my sister because she just doesn’t have the same emotions as me. She wasn’t as close to my dog, so she just keeps telling me to not think about it.

I knew this would happened someday and all I wanted was the chance to say goodbye to my best friend. I’m just alone and miserable. I can’t hold myself together, and I have no one to talk to. I just feel helpless and betrayed.",22Oct2019,12
213,"tl;dr can't make it more than 2-3 months at a time in therapy, though the only therapist I've ever seen has been wonderful. Feels phony to entrust another human in giving me the tools to sort out my own life, almost like I'm supposed to believe they've got some ethereal insight that nobody else has (except some sort of higher being). Cheapens the idea of therapy to a smoke-and-mirrors show for me; wondering how to get past this mentality.

I would say that this ""season"" of my life can be categorized as very unstable. The last two years, I've gone through several experiences that I know was a direct result of my failing mental health and have taken some measures to help me help myself, those measures including seeing doctors, psychiatrists, going back on medication, scheduling appointments with psychologists and lastly, reuniting myself with my old therapist. 

When it comes to things like therapy or medication, I have these bouts where I will hardcore believe in the power of change that they can bring to my life but that all comes crumbling at about the 2-3 month period in which I'll pretty much sever all intentions to continue these things. It happens all the time with medication, I'll never miss a beat, take it at the same time everyday but one day comes and I decide that I never again want to swallow an SSRI. Therapy on the other hand, is also something that I've experienced in small batches and while I love the idea of therapy and more importantly, feel that I mesh well with my therapist (zero complaints on her, she's amazing)...I always find myself low-key distrustful of therapists in general, which makes it really hard to want to seek help from them.

In my mind, therapists are humans too and it feels weird to me that I (and other people) put so much faith in these select few people to help sort everyone else's shit out. As humans, they surely deal with all of the emotions that others go through, and somehow it feels disingenuous to come to a person and remove the fact that they are just as vulnerable to the same shit that I'm going through as I am, yet trust them to give me the tools to fix my life. It feels phony and it makes me not want to believe in therapy at all, simply for the fact that the method in which I'd receive therapy is something that I inherently don't \[want to\] trust. 

Like I said before, the therapist that I \*had\* (it's been months since I've scheduled an appointment and I have no intention on scheduling anytime soon) was great. The first time I met her, which was 4 years ago, I remember thinking to myself ""wow, that wasn't so bad"" and of course when you go to therapy the first time, it can be challenging to open yourself up to someone you don't know but I never felt weird going in the moment. But eventually, I had the idea that the role this woman played professionally (modern hero for the mentally disturbed) was bogus and that she had no better insight into how to fix a human brain than I did, even if she spent x years studying whatever. I know there's due to be some fallacy in that notion however, it's still enough for me to feel very wary of trusting someone with my life the way people always suggest you do with therapists. 

Does anyone else feel this same sentiment? If you have or do, what are some ways to get over this? I feel like I've hit a point where my life feels so fucking grey and though I have a support system in some ways (great friends who I can talk to about this, a family who I don't want to talk to about this), I feel so bored of it all. I'm on a tightrope constantly, wondering if I'll ever make it to the end or plunge to my very bitter death. I don't want to kill myself but I'm starting to rationalize the process of it because I'm that bored and maybe therapy will allow me to rationalize some reason to not do that, though I'm so indifferent to it all.",22Oct2019,1

I have a lack of empathy unless Its for personal gain, or I know you too well. I have horrible relationships with people, or it seems that way with me.

221,"So earlier this year my mom died. It’s been really hard, as I am an only child and she was a single mom. I started therapy about 3 months after she died, and at first it was really helpful. I began DBT to help with my reactive behaviors I was starting to experience due to not being able to handle everything. I finished the book and am still actively using the workshops in it, but over the last two months or so I have started to find it increasingly difficult to control my emotions - not my behaviors. Since I began therapy, I broke up with my boyfriend, have had an outing with a person I consider a best friend, and have been having a lot of difficulty at work. My grandparents are both getting much older and so are my dogs, which has increased my anxiety and depression ten fold. I am increasingly anxious about what others think about me, if I’m attractive, if I’m doing enough, if I am smart enough, etc. My anxiety has become almost debilitating, to the point in the last few days I couldn’t leave my room, and today I had to leave work early after I sat in my car for an hour and just drove around aimlessly. I am feeling so lost. 

I am not looking for an armchair diagnosis or anything, but I do feel like I need some direction in my therapy. I want to recommend something to her for her to help me.

They’re not scary images, but for some reason I feel cared of them cause they’re making me feel a certain way. Really anxious and sad and depressed and hopeless at the same time.",22Oct2019,1
226,"I know it sounds dumb, but I feel like I'm not suicidal enough to be taken seriously. I've felt suicidal for a few months now, I've tried to reach out for help, but no one's really been taking me seriously. I've point blank told people that I feel this way, I've just been told to get some help and then I'm almost ignored. It's hard to get help whenever you try and reach out the help tells you to get help. (I cannot seek professional help on my own, sadly). I feel like I'll never actually do it, but these feelings are overwhelming and intrusive. I just hope it gets better, and I hope that I don't make my friends uncomfortable.",22Oct2019,1

228,"Hello I am a senior at visible music college in Memphis TN Ive been going for a while and i noticed that the school has changed so much to the point that it isn't the school i imagined it would be. It is a christian school so since it is that way I'm taking more biblical classes then music classes. I am a type of person who is really nice and cares for others. With that being said we had a preacher say how all buddhist are going to hell, so I stood up for them and said that ""We don't like it when people point fingers at us and say Jesus never existed, so if we do that to other religions then we are no different. We should accept other peoples beliefs and infact we could learn alot from them and become better christians..""  Another time a woman was leading worship and she said ""If you have a mental illness or suffer from depression then you don't have a relationship with Jesus."" Ever since i stood up for the buddhist the students point fingers and say I'm going to hell. I hate it hear its really pushing me towards the edge and its getting to the point when i hear voices telling me to kill myself and I'm really scared that one day i will go through with it. I suffer from bipolar and Ive talked to a few reliable people about my mental health and their always too busy to talk it makes me feel abandoned... I would really like to talk to a pastor of any religion, because ever since I went to visible school i don't know what to believe anymore..Please help me!!",22Oct2019,2
229,"So I just joined this sub and I don't really know what to say.. I guess pretty much all I have to say is I'm not sure if I'm ok or not. To give a bit of context I'm a 14 year old girl so I suppose a lot of things could just be hormones but idk. I'm not really sure whats going on really. I've always had issues like crying constantly and being just very sad in general. And I've had phases off and on where I considered suicide but I'm not really sure if thats normal or not either. If I'm being honest, I'm just kind of lost. I know I'm young but no one really talks to me, especially about things like this so I dont even know what's normal and what isnt. I was never really too worried about it until recently. A few months ago I started having major mood swings (which can also be linked to hormones) and I was just really angry. And within the past few weeks it kinda changed again and now I get suddenly nauseous and anxious. I've gotten into the habit of only eating a meal a day at the most and I overall just feel nothing. Like nothing really makes me happy anymore and I don't enjoy doing anything. Not only that but I can't cry anymore even if I try to so I can at least feel something yknow. There's a lot going on with school atm plus I dont know the next time Im going to see my mom so it could just be from stress but idk, Ive never felt like this before. I've taken a lot of those quizzes or whatever online which I know are far from reliable but I have yet to take one that has said I don't have either depression or anxiety. I hate to self diagnose myself because one of my biggest pet peeves is people who say they are depressed for attention but I am at least curious if I have something of the sort. I honestly wouldn't even consider it but my stepmom and friends have said multiple times they think something is going on, plus depression is very very common in my family. Ive talked to my stepmom about seeing someone but since my brother is having issues with his anger Im not really the main focus I suppose. I completely understand that he needs help and honestly he deserves it more than I do, I just have gotten to the point to where I feel miserable all the time and it hurts yknow. Anyways, if anyone has any advice Id love to hear it and thanks for reading :)",22Oct2019,1
230,"The last 3-4years have been really up and down for me, I really fell in love for the first time and crawled out of the wall I had build up during elementary school. I was bullied and became scared of showing weakness or seeming vulnerable. After that a couple of years passed and I had my first real crush.
I stepped out of my comfort zone and really opened up to someone, I poured my heart out, at some point we got together.
I felt happy and accepted just being me, I felt loved.
But just a couple of days before she would have come back from camp everything blows over it turns out she was saying we were together to please me and get away from me, she ignored me and all my following conversations with her only came handed over to me via her best friend.
So I crawled back into my hole, scared of attaching to anyone because nobody actually liked me, in my head everybody just was annoyed me.
Fast forward I'm 1½years in a relationship that is exhausting me and by the end of it I'm skipping school for 2-3months just to get away from my gf.

I finally broke up. 

I started attaching my self to slightest sign of compassion towards me.
I had a real fuck boy phase, but only because in the end was the scared trust anyone enough to be in a relationship.
About a year later high school in germany starts, I'm 17 at this point.
In drama class, one of the few places in really felt comfortable I met a new girl, she just stayed in New Zealand for a year. She was blonde, smaller than me and had the greatest simile on the planet and she like me too.
We fell in love quickly but for the first time in a very long time,

it felt right.

I was in love or at least I told my self that, even though I wasn't completely sure in the beginning. I certainly was when our first anniversary rolled around. But then her mental health started to deteriorate, she became suicidal and I was overwhelmed, I was scared of losing her but also felt exhausted, more and more often, I started skipping school again. We started to fight more often and I got worse and worse. We didn't see eachother the days. Then weeks. Eventually we broke up, for a month and a half we were apart. Some days during that time I felt liberated other times I couldn't sleep, because I was too worried about her. During that time she started therapy.
Eventually we got talking again and fell in love again. She felt better, I felt better.
But I stayed bumpy and everything now in then we would see each other for a couple of days. This is the point in time were I first had suicidal thoughts slowly creeping around in my head. She suggested starting therapy... I shrugged it of.
During the summer I was on vacation with her and her family, and that completely drained me. She left the following week for Iceland I just wanted to collect my self, so we didn't really text for a few days. She took this a sign of breaking, and dated a different guy 2 times right after she came back from Iceland, never physical she says, but most certainly emotionally.
Meanwhile I was on a trip with my parents. And asked her to join. She did, I instantly felt like something was of, she keept denying everything until in explicitly asked her whether she cheated or not. She admitted in but never apologized.
I fucking gave her second chance and for two months everything went back to normal. The last 3 weeks I was in Cuba and due to the shitty internet there the had barley and contact, but in the back of my had this suspension arose.
I was scared. When I came back everything was different she didn't want to believe me when I said that therapy is helping me and that I'm fixing my issues, for the last week everything has been on ice. 
All my hopes crushed, she said she wants to try different things, she made a tinder profile. 
I'm trying to win her back but once again I feel betrayed and used and lied to. I stayed with her through her roughest times and as soon as I'm in a bad spot she cuts me lose.

Nobody wants me I just want peace.",22Oct2019,2
231,How do I get out of this stupid funk? I feel like my mind is talking to itself too much lately and I’m consistently thinking gruesome things like wanting to stab a knife into my stomach and pull my intestines out just for the fun.,22Oct2019,1
