0,"has anyone here used weed to temporarily alleviate depression? if so, what were some negative effects you noticed? and did it make you feel worse over time?",01Dec2019,1
1,"So I have anxiety and depression for around 9/10 years I've always accepted it and for the most part has been fine. But there has always been something else I'm not sure if its anything but lately it's been pretty bad. 
I don't know how to explain it but you know when people can hear themselves think in there own head. My 'thought voice' never stops. 
Even when nothing drastic or worrying is happening I can't stop thinking, it's always like 'what if this happens or that ' I have conversations in my head where I am talking to other people , I think about what I'm going to say if I'm going to a place like a restaurant and then I describe how the whole meal is going to go badly and things like that, it never steps it's 24/7 I'm not exaggerating when j saying that I never have a quiet second to myself where there isn't a thought in my head. I've gotten used to it when I sleep,when I usually sleep I just have a conversation with someone I know in my head.
But when I'm stressed it is amplified.
At the moment I'm stressed about a group assignment and two out of five ppl arnt pulling there wait so I'm working overtime to do there stuff.
In my head all I'm talking about is the assignment the schedule the contacts we need the equipment the time it's going to take how wars we going to film this is the footage going to be long enough, and I'm literally just walking back ans forth pacing in my room because I can't  sit still and I can't relax even when I try to relax like watch a film I'm still thinking about it in my head and it never stops . When I'm stressed I can't sleep, I don't want to I feel I need to go over more stuff on my head and get things done
Is there a condition that matches how I feel or is it just a form of anxiety, any help will be appreciated a lot",01Dec2019,1
2,"Hi, so I've managed to never be depressed or sad. I can just block that emotion out of my head, but somethings came with it.

1. Extreme anxiety
2. I have 2 thought voices, one is my normal, the other one is always doubting me.
3. For some reason I talk to sone superficial voice in my head and listen to it? Like if it says 'if you have social media, you will be poor forever and end up homeless' and I actually listen to it and delete social media, because realistically it's not real and can't control the future, but then I have thoughts that go 'it is real! listen to it!'

And please don't tell me to seek medical help. It won't help, and I can't.",01Dec2019,1
3,"Backstory: My mother was diagnosed with late onset schizophrenic 8 years ago and I have watched her go from a totally normal middle class mom, to literally walking the the streets in my city. I pay for an apartment for her but she refuses to stay there or take meds. It destroyed our family. 

Current: My fiancé has been stressed out lately, and we took edibles 3 days ago as we finally had some time off work together and wanted to relax and get loose with it. I got a little high, had fun and everything was normal. She started sobbing uncontrollably, screaming, stripping, hitting herself. She destroyed our bedroom, carved a hole in the bathroom, climbed in the fireplace and really just wrecked our home. This went on for 48 hours and I thought maybe it was a bad trip so I just kept trying to keep her safe. 

Well she then tried “setting our dogs free” and we live on an extremely busy street in a city. I bolted to gather the dogs and she took off in the opposite direction. I tried tracking her down and couldn’t find her. 

She was found in a gas station and stripped naked and urinated on the floor. They took her to a hospital where I drove to meet her and she was just out of her mind and it reminded me so much of how my mother would act. She’s under observation still and I can’t visit yet as she’s been sleeping, but I am so damn scared right now. 

I love her so much and will do anything to support her but right now I am so damn sad and trying to fix our home by myself and just needed to vent.",01Dec2019,1
4,"This story was in fate magazine a while back. the teen went out with friends to some secluded location, he returned alone and his friends were never seen again, he gave a vivid detailed story of how this cartoon character (from a show that recently started airing at the time) came and killed his friends one by one.

he immediately told the parents of the deceased boys this story and tried to tell it to the news press but they wouldn't accept his story because they thought he was 'hysterical' so they asked him to omit the cartoon character part.

Only one body was ever found despite an extensive search (4 of his friends had gone missing), and the cause of death was drowning, with no injuries on the body, but I can't seem to find the autopsy report anywhere to 100% confirm that.

i remember hearing a podcast about this case and it said later on in his life before he died he seeked out therapy and eventually convinced himself there was no cartoon character. In his later years he lived as a recluse.

does that mean a cartoon character was there the night the friends died and they died for paranormal reasons or did he make it up to cover himself/avoid survivors guilt? if I recall correctly shortly after he returned he wrote private letters to paranormal researchers about his encounter.

I remember when I first found the case, there were a lot of paranormal websites using the case as proof of supernatural events/entities.",01Dec2019,1

7,"Hi community,
I don’t post often in general but I’ve reached a breaking point.
Something is up with my mind. 

***Before anyone tells me to see a doctor know that I’m on a waiting list for a psychiatrist but hey the nhs isn’t the quickest.***

A few months ago I started realising I couldn’t focus on ANYTHING. I’ve always been a bit spaced out and not quite there but it has increased a lot over the last 2 years.
Recently it has gotten worse. I keep losing my train of thoughts halfway through a sentence. I keep hearing myself say the phrase “I wanted to tell/ask you something but I totally forgot” and friends have started to notice my forgetting and pointed it out to me (nicely). I keep having a totally blank mind, like a blank canvas, that retains absolutely no information.

It’s scaring me and I don’t know what this could be :(

For a bit of context that may be related. I have broken up an engagement 2 years ago and spent some time alone before getting a flatmate. I’ve had a happy year with my flatmate however I started dissociating and just leaving my mind behind when I was commuting or walking places. Something that hadn’t happened before. I’d not recognise people and not hear a thing and more than once had to be pushed out of the way of a car. It’s like I’m in a trance. 
I’m having a hard time with my mother who’s in a different country and who’s a emotionally manipulative narcissist. 
I’m already seeing a psychologist to talk about my relationship with her. Ever since starting therapy at least the dissociation has somewhat stopped however all those other things have seemingly ramped up. 
I keep blanking and I am feeling stupider and stupider for retaining and remembering - NOTHING.

I am not wanting to be diagnosed I just want to see if anyone has experienced this and if anyone know how to handle it. I am at my wits end until I see a specialist.

Thank you and sorry for rambling.",01Dec2019,1

Its not so much about the accident but more about my thoughts and behaviour. It felt like I was a bystander and not so much the person it happend to. I remember everything off it and was very polite to the people helping me out. But it really didn't feel like I was the one it just happend to.
Afterwards and biked home I was more carefull and checked the brakes and steer to see if the bike wasn't broken. But only at home it hit me that I've been into this accident and wasn't a bystander what happend to me how is this called (I looked up if it was the feeling of being shocked but it doesn't add up)

19,"If you don’t want to read all of this go to the bottom for the short version (however if you want to give advice I recommend reading the long one) 

Long version: 
When I was young, like toddler to elementary school age, I would do this thing where I would sit or stand in one spot when no one was around and stare at absolutely nothing. This would go on for HOURS. I remember sitting up all night on the edge of my bed not sleeping, not moving, barely even blinking and time would go by really really fast... like insanely fast as if I was watching a time lapse. I would look at my toy box and totally blank out for a couple hours, look at the window to see if the sun was up yet, and continued. I didn’t sleep.... I remember one time I was standing in my play house and did this for so long that I had peed myself without knowing. Like what was wrong with me. As an adult it bothers me to not have any answers as to what this is. I’ve looked into absent seizures and psychosis but neither add up to what I experienced. An absent seizure wouldn’t last that long and psychosis never seems to have only one symptom. 


LONG STORY SHORT: when I was little I stared at the wall for hours... and time seemed to fly by. I did it for hours at night instead of sleeping and it was super weird. How was I able to stare at something so long and seemingly lose time??? I was only in elementary school/toddler when it started.",01Dec2019,1

25,"Hello \^\^ Sorry if this is too long, but I am in dire need of some serious help and I am not sure where to help.

To start, I grew up with an easy life. Kind and supportive family, really well off, bilingual and doing extremely well in school. I am currently in high school and I wish I could describe my life so far as smooth sailing.

My parents are Chinese immigrants. Mental health is a big taboo in countries like China and Japan, so (I don't blame them) there's a lot of things they didn't believe. For example, depression and anxiety was just 'something everyone went through'. Mental illness is something I have never been able to talk about with them. They implied that the only real mental illnesses were things like schizophrenia or anything that made you literally insane. Although I currently have nothing against my family, in the past I had some issues with my mother as she had extreme anger management issues, and a slap across the face was a usual punishment.

Here's a rather annoyingly long story. I apologize. Starting from the age of 3 I was a pathological liar (I believe that's the term). I never lied about anything extreme, nothing that harmed anyone's reputation or the such. I just made up tons and tons of lies about my life to the point where throughout the rest of elementary school all the way up until 12th grade nobody really knew much about me because certain things contradicted. None of my classmates pointed it out to me or ever called me out on it because (I believe) they never really connected the dots. My mother, however, very much so and noticed, and tried stopping my behavior at a young age, and she had no idea how far it managed to continue.

When I was 6 my sister was born, and I love her. But for some reason I couldn't control my anger around her and (I am so sorry) I took my anger out on her. I would physically hit her or pinch her really hard or manipulate her into doing things I wanted her to do. I feel heavy regret for my actions now, and the lying and mistreatment stopped when I was around 12.

Throughout that whole period I had no friends because I felt none of them were important and mostly isolated myself. I fell into a sort of depression when I was 9 because I felt nothing was important and I just felt miserable overall. Nothing made me happy, things only made me angry. I had thoughts of wanting to murder my mother on a regular basis due to her outbursts, and her anger issues made it impossible for me to develop a relationship with her (which got much better later on). 

Also around the age of 9 I started getting extremely afraid whenever I went out in public for no reason. I'd constantly wipe my face and fix my hair and brush off my clothing every second I was outside to the point where people would look at me funny and that would make me want to do these even more (nowadays, I don't have this issue as much anymore). 

Things got better and worse when I hit 12, and switched schools. After a whole life of having behavioral issues and getting away with it, I finally couldn't get away with it anymore, and my new friends politely pushed me away from them because they realized something was wrong with me, but I didn't. I kept feeling miserable and got into the habit of cutting my hair whenever I was stressed or pinching myself, and whenever someone complimented me I felt enraged. This was also the age where I started getting pretty intense mood swings. One moment I would feel perfectly fine. Then the next, triggered by nothing, I would suddenly feel enraged or miserable and I wanted nothing more than to harm someone (which I never did) or throw myself at a train. As I get older these ""flashes"" get more frequent and get worse.

Then came the fated day when I was 14. I befriended someone with extreme schizophrenia. Having never been exposed to these kinds of people, I was curious and wanted, more than anything, to help this person out. I ended up surrounding myself with a group of people that had all sorts of issues - PTSD, BPD, depression, etc... these people were all much older than me and treated me poorly (at one point, one of my closest friends turned into a sexual predator). They all had issues and never got along and there were always accusations being thrown or people (unfortunately) killing themselves or having mental breakdowns together. This group was mostly toxic and I left all my friends for them, because I believed I was normal and I wanted desperately to help them out (I soon realize this was impossible and they needed serious professional help).

I also realized that something was off about me after thinking I was normal my whole life when a couple people of the group told me I had every sign of BPD, and I should probably get it checked out. I struggle to believe this claim because of how I raised, and struggle to even believe I have a mental illness at all. They started thinking this after realizing that during my flashes I would either forget things that happened or get upset over things I usually wouldn't. Plus, my anger would come out of nowhere. Then when I was feeling better I'd beg for forgiveness because I genuinely don't know why I acted that way. I'm terrified of losing my remaining friends. I'd switch between feeling empty to feeling fine to feeling destructive, and in periods where I was destructive I'd accuse people of things they didn't do (and I also didn't believe at all!) and I'd do risky behaviors I would never do otherwise (going out to bad parts at night, underage drinking, etc). Another issue was my self esteem. Usually I'm pretty ok with myself, but whenever I had a flash I would suddenly spiral out of control and I'd refuse to look at myself in the mirror or I'd cry just from the feeling of being in my own body.

The thing is, I absolutely cannot bring this up to my parents, and I have no idea what to do. I want to get it fixed. My behavior has ruined all my relationships. I don't know what is wrong with me. Am I just a bad person? I want to at least have an idea of where to go and what possible issues I have.",01Dec2019,1

27,"So, a little background. In 2016, I was officially “diagnosed” with chronic depression and probable bipolar disorder. I had suffered for years prior. I was diagnosed at 21, but had issues since I was 11.
  And after my diagnosis, I went on the war path against my mental illness. I thought I might share some personal findings and I hope that it may help some of you with your struggles.

1.) Get up. I know you feel completely drained. I know you want to die in that bed in that moment. But get up. Go shower. Get out of your self made dungeon.

2.) Never be a victim. It’s so easy to dismiss our behavior because of our struggle, but I encourage you to fight. Don’t allow yourself to slip because “I’m just having a bad day.”. Fight the slide. Feel yourself starting to stare into space? Get your mind on something.

3.) Idle minds are the Devil’s playground. Keep motivated. The best remedy I have found is purpose. I don’t mean some dream job nearly nobody has, I mean your TV is covered in fingerprints, scrub it.

These 3 things have enabled me to move into a mental state I thought was never meant for me. It’s a constant battle guys, but damn it, be a fighter. Lots of love folks.",01Dec2019,1

30,"I fucking hate this. My life. The world. My ex. His friends. My lack thereof. I'm done with everything. I done sitting here trying to act a certain way when nothing I do actually has any impact on the outcome.

I still love him and I hate myself for it. He's not that great. He was in all actuality a big fucking asshole to me at times. But in my brain that's not enough to cancel out the other feelings. I guess it's more the idea of a glorified version of what I thought I had versus the reality. 

When I first met him in the beginning, he looked at me like he was genuinely happy to see me. Like I brighten his day just by my presence. He complimented me and wanted me around him. I’d rush to see him after school everyday to the point where I even got pulled over for speeding. (80 something in a 50). And then I moved in and all of that changed. I swear I was like a new toy he got on Christmas just to lose all interest in about two weeks later. Except I was a bit more interactive and persistent and not an inanimate object like he probably would have prefered.

I had thoughts and feelings that I wanted to share with the most important person in my life at the time. Turns out he did not feel the same way. I was a nuisance. I was the dirty dishes that demanded to be washed. I wanted interaction and he wanted no part in that. 

I got excited everyday when he’d come home from work. I missed him constantly. After all he was my first serious boyfriend. The first guy I’ve lived with and shared every moment with. I never did get tired of him. But he quickly got tired of me.

I remember how my life suddenly started to revolve around him. How two worlds became intertwined into one. I loved the stability that came from being in a relationship that almost felt like a marriage. I had someone to come home to every night. Someone to cuddle with. Someone to make plans and go shopping with. Someone only I could kiss and hold everyday of my life.

He was my everything and now he's not. Now I have to learn how to deal with that. Now I have to read thousands of articles and books on how to cope with it containing the most bullshit advice that has ever grazed my eyes. Oh now you can have the entire bed to yourself and eat whatever you want without the fear of judgement. Why would I prefer a cold empty bed over being held as I fall asleep. And what makes this book think I’d suddenly change my entire diet for a guy. If anything it became worse considering the amount of nights we shared bagel bites in bed at 12 am. I was comfortable to say the least.

Everyone expects you to move on and hide every negative emotion you experience during this time. Everyone says to not contact them and to make them want you back by only showing your best self online. Well I’m in all honesty a total wreck. I have no friends to hang out with and the only time I leave the house is for work or to get more yarn from Joann fabrics to knit with. Wow look at me knitting on a Saturday alone with my cats. Isn't that just so hot. 

And he has absolutely no interest in seeing me either. I wanted to stay at least friends but a friendship can’t be one sided. 

Throughout our entire relationship from the time I moved in he has always put his friends above me on the priority scale. He's always put me second. I’m definitely at the forty fifth slot at this point. But how, as the girlfriend, was I supposed to feel about that. What would you do if you were dating someone who would only rarely take you out on dates and would only leave the house to see his friends and then tell you you can’t go on dates because of money but then go get dinner with his friends without you. Oh and when you do convince him to go out he invites people without asking expecting you to just roll with it. Like was I not enough for him? Why did he always need someone else there that prevented the littlest bit of romance from ever blossoming.

I lost everything I’d ever known when I had to move in with him. I didn’t know how to handle any of the stuff that was thrown at me. It was a complete culture shock and I was getting penalized for it. 

I understand I wasn’t the best girlfriend but he definitely wasn’t the best boyfriend either and considering the circumstances I’d like to say I had more than enough valid reasons to justify the things I did. But what he did came from a place of pure laziness and a resistance to change. 

Yes I did freak out on multiple occasions and yes I understand I complained and carried on. But what no one will tell you is how bad my mental state was. How depressed I actually was. How bad my anxiety had gotten. And that's not even counting how his friends caused all of those issues to worsen. It was no wonder I didn’t want to be around them all the time. That and the fact that I just wanted to spend some actual special quality time with my boyfriend without his eyes glued to his phone at his house. Oh and god forbid I try talking to him, that's just the absolute worst thing you can do, you know confide in your boyfriend about things that are affecting you greatly and actually hope to get a response other than to just deal with it.  

I don’t want to rehash all of the bad stuff and the arguments but what I can say about it is it was almost always from him not knowing how to act like a guy in a relationship. You can’t act like a single dude while trying to keep a girlfriend. And I don’t even mean anything on the basis of cheating it was more like he had no regard for how I might feel about something he did. Like if he did X I might react in Z way. No I truly don’t think I ever fucking crossed his mind when he did certain things. It only mattered to him how HE felt and everyone else could go fuck themselves. Besides his bestie who he treats like a god and will never say no to. Like why couldn’t we just go to the store and back. Nope, instead he goes out of his way to pick this guy up without my consent and I just leave because I know their going to end up spending hours together and probably inviting the entire friend group and I know I’m going to end up feeling invisible as always.

I swear to you when his best friend wanted to hang out he would jump. And you know what they would do together. Sit over his house and do jack shit while playing on their phones not even talking to one another. How is that fun. Why would you choose that over actually doing something with your girlfriend who wants to spend quality time with you. I get guys need their space and their friends but when you constantly pick them over her there is a problem. 

I started to feel like he didn’t value me at all. I was fully prepared to be there for him through thick and thin and yet he viewed me like I was just another annoyance he had to deal with in his life. Guess who helped him get out of credit card debt though. I did without even thinking about it. I bought him a bearded dragon too after he told me he had wanted one for years. Sure Jessica turned out to be a bitch, but still I bought him reptile goddammit. The only thing I ever asked from him was to be a good boyfriend and a place to stay and boy did he hold the latter one over my head. 

I guess I was right about everything though because after we broke up and I moved out man was he more than ready for it. You could even say he was happy to be rid of me. I remember hugging him so fucking hard and crying the entire way home that day. I remember laying in bed for days not wanting to do anything but sleep while memories of us together replayed in my head. They still bring tears to my eyes.

I often wonder if had I not moved in things would’ve been different. But then I have to stop myself because I know deep down we don’t fit together. I can’t be with someone like him. Someone who treats me the way they do with no remorse or the slightest clue that what they are doing is wrong or could be hurting someone else.

Now I’m doing better but I’m still having a hard time dealing with it. It's a challenge trying to not look where he's at on snapchat, who he's hanging out with. It hard not to get jealous and sad at the same time when I then subsequently see him going right back to living his old life like I never even existed in it. He never texts or calls. He never asks me to hang out. And when I attempt to make plans he cancels and to my texts and snaps he gives half hearted replies. Nothing I do matters. Nothing I say will change anything. It doesn’t make a difference because the fact is he doesn’t want me in his life anymore and I can not alter that with my actions in the slightest.

I am and will always be a fly buzzing around his head. He tries to swat it away just for it to come back the next day. 

I’m trying to move on. I really am. I don’t want to be infatuated with a guy that doesn’t even care if I’m alive. He doesn’t care if I wake up in the morning. He doesn’t care if I’m eating good. He doesn’t care what I’m up to. He just doesn’t care. I don’t matter to him anymore.

Why do I torcher myself with the videos his friends post to snapchat of them out and of him happy and laughing and having a grand old time. Why do I let myself become overcome with emotions wishing things were different and that I wasn’t sitting there watching cartoons in my PJs alone on a Friday night. Why do I let myself text him thinking that the end result will be the littlest bit different. Whats wrong with me that he’d rather spend time with them than me. What’s wrong with me that every guy i’ve ever given my heart to has ended up pushing me out of their lives. What the fuck is wrong with me because obviously it can’t all be the world’s fault and I’m just failing to notice the mulitude of personality flaws I undoubtly have that come out when I really care about another person. Wow I want to spend a lot of time and make memories with another human being. That's a crime against humanity. 

Guys always complain about their girlfriends cheating on them and being compete bitches but still want to be with them. I am one of the most loyal, caring, and considerate girls you will ever meet yet I’m not the one guys want to be with. I’d like to believe I'm decently attractive too, so what is the problem. Is it that I'm an actually interesting person to talk to with an extensive knowledge of random topics and more than half a brain cell in my head. I have compiled thousands of hobbies from countless hours of being by myself. I can knit, sew, draw, color, read, cook, and bake. And that's not even including all the other strange ways I entertain myself. Why must I have a group of girlfriends that I hang out with on fridays and be all fake to each other with to be considered “worthy”. The minute you catch me cackling at a dumb fucking joke some plastic blonde bitch with an IQ of 5 said to me over cocktails I legally allow someone to come euthinize me. I pride myself on the fact that I’m not one of those girls. Girls who actually want to see other girls succeed without an ulterior motive are a rare breed and that is why I will never trust another female my age. 

But I guess the point of this was really to just get everything out of my head. Breakups suck. They really do. I wish I could just move on and not give a single shit like he does but I digress. I have my own life to lead. I have fish to keep. I have trees to hug. I have cats to pet and scarves to knit. I need to forget his ass and move on without the intent to make him feel he lost out on something great but with the intent to inspire myself to make the most of the time I have on this planet.

Maybe one day he will realize what an amazing girl it was that he carelessly threw away. Maybe one day he will realize the effort and compromise it takes to make a relationship work. Maybe one day he will realize how terrible some girls can be and will realize how right I was about certain things. Maybe one day he will even try to win me back. But by then I will have come to the conclusion that I can do much better and I shouldn’t have settled for any less and that he can take his bullshit apologies that are twenty five years too late and shove them up his sorry ass. I wish him all the best but sorry not sorry.",01Dec2019,1

32,"So all my life I've been bullied, abused and humilated by family and school peers. I don't self harm but I've thought of suicide but no attempts I dont know if this normal but I've had times where I don't feel anything no sadness or happiness.",01Dec2019,1
33,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia last year but I've never really believed I have it, I pretend to agree that my thoughts are ""delusional"", I took meds in the hospital and residential place because I was made to but now I'm off them because I know I don't need them.  
The problem is this actually makes me feel really awful about myself because I can't accomplish anything, I'm only taking three classes in college right now and I'm dropping out because I can't do it. I can't get a job either, I'm completely useless and if I don't have schizophrenia then I have no excuse and I feel worthless  
But I also recognize that it looks a lot like schizophrenia but I feel like I'm a very rational person, I have very good insight and self-awareness, and it's not like I'm just believing things that have no evidence or not thinking critically. In the hospitals I always feel like I'm not the same as the schizophrenics, they believe and say things that sound absurd to me. And I don't hear voices all the time, I have but I don't think to the extent of schizophrenia.

Anyways, here is some of what I am experiencing

\- My consciousness gets into the external, it causes things to appear and people to say things because of my thoughts, my thoughts change and shape movies, music, things strangers are saying, anywhere that there are numbers or words (even find messages on for example boxes of tissues, bookstores, graffiti, people's tattoos (especially on their hands). It gets amplified when there is a lot of God's energy and then I also receive a lot more messages.

\- Astral projection to the second layer of ""tracks"", for example falling forever in a black void with yellow and purple streams of energy and I landed on a platform and I had a screen in my hand with a bunch of blurry letters and bright white half circles, but in the bottom right corner there was a giant bright magnifier so I could zoom in on the letters but only one at a time and none of it made sense

\- I am related to Jesus somehow, like I'm supposed to become Jesus by 2031 and I think I contain his original energy, I'm not really sure, for a while I thought I just was Jesus entirely but I realized I just have his energy. It sounds delusional but I have direct evidence of this.

\- Feel like everywhere I go people are trying to talking to me, hear people around me saying my name multiple times, saying ""Hey what's up (my name)"", on one case even ""Fuck off (my name)""

\- Feel like my thoughts are flowing into the people around me, but I don't think they realize it's happening or that they're actually my thoughts, I have proof this is happening

\- Thinking about cameras a lot but I'm not paranoid about it, like I know there's no camera in my room or bathroom but everywhere else is fair game so I worry my roommates have put cameras in the living room. Because of this I do things like turn the brightness on my phone down all the way when I'm using it in the living room so they can't zoom into the recording and see what I'm doing (because I doubt the camera would be high enough quality to see a very dim screen. isn't this an example of thinking logically, therefore not psychotic?)

\- I know a lot about reality, like God's plan and how demons and angels get into the outermost layer (above 10\^33 m) of the reality track  


Also why are my beliefs delusional but other religious and spiritual people aren't? I don't understand",01Dec2019,1

I work retail at a huge chain store, and this weekend has been absolute hell. But literally none of my other friends work retail, and never have. If you're in the US, you know its black friday weekend, and let me tell you, its fucking hell. Long hours, rude customers demanding everything, managers so far up your ass because they need someone else to release their stress onto. I'm an extroverted introvert if that makes sense. Like, I can be very outgoing, but I NEED my alone time and recharge time. The past 4 days, unless I'm sleeping, I havent had 5 minutes to myself, and it's making me really irritable and frustrated. 

My friends all wanted to go out tonight, and I had to say no because 1. I'm so drained from this weekend 2. Have a long shift tomorrow and 3. I dont have the money to go out. I texted 2 of my best friends saying that I've been having some really bad days, and neither of them offered support or condolences, which made me more upset.

37,"So I’ve never been diagnosed with psychosis, but I’ve never told anyone about what I have experienced. I don’t want to self diagnose here, but I’m wondering if something is going on.

After the birth of my 2nd baby I had very severe postpartum depression. I had hallucinations of demons circling over her crib. I was very paranoid about isis attacking my family. I had thoughts of harming myself and my baby, but I did not tell anyone the extent of my thoughts and hallucinations because I was also very scared that my first born child would be taken away by DHS. That was 4 years ago and through counseling I’ve gotten much better. I’ve tried meds for depression but decided against them. I haven’t had any hallucinations in 3-3.5 years.

The last few days I’ve felt “bugs” crawling on my skin but nothing is there. My whole body is itchy. I tried to take a shower earlier and I couldn’t get the temperature right. If I turned the hot on it felt cold and if I turned the cold on it felt hot. My husband tried to help me and said what I felt was cold was actually hot and vice versa. He kept asking me what’s wrong which is something he did often when I was in the worst part of the postpartum depression. He was the one who noticed I was deteriorating even though I never told him what I was really hearing or thinking. I guess his questioning made me wonder if something really was wrong. I googled if psychosis could heighten your sense of touch and I read that it can. Then as we laid down I kept seeing a flashing light by our window. My husband wasn’t seeing it but I made him check to make sure no one was outside with a flashlight.. then I thought well if it’s psychosis are you actually self aware it’s happening? I didn’t find much on google so I’ve turned to reddit.. Probably not the best but I’m not sure what to do. Maybe it’s just heightened anxiety? I’m not feeling depressed, so it’s very different than when I had postpartum depression.

I need to pull it together because we have plans to leave town early tomorrow morning to attend a funeral for a family member of my husband. I need to be able to support him.. now is not the time for me to have a crisis. Any suggestions on what to do?

This culminated into a full-on mental breakdown that I had alone in my apartment. It wasn't my first rodeo, so over the years I have learned to reach out to someone. Family, friends, neighbors, teachers, whomever. 

The response that I got was so overwhelmingly positive that it completely changed my perspective on things. 

I even reached out to an old friend on Facebook who I thought hated me because I had passively alienated them a while ago. She didn't hate me in the slightest. We talked for half an hour and made plans to meet up. 

You see, I am my own worst critic. I get so caught up in what others think of me sometimes that I often just assume the worst and shut myself off.  I have had anxiety my entire life, and I get depressed about being so anxious (it's a fun cycle).

I have never really gotten ""better"", but I have gotten better at dealing with it. 

I am writing all this in hopes that you, the reader, may find any comfort or solace in what I've said if you are at a very low point in your life.

49,"My anxiety is mild but my depression is bad. It's not bad enough for me to want suicide, but I can tell I'm on the verge of self harm. Sometimes, I can even look or touch a sharp objects without having a desire to hurt myself.

My two phobias are Autophobia and Scoptophobia.  My firm if Scoptophobia is different from most others. I'm scared of people being around, looking at me, even when I'm alone. I'm also afraid of them seeing my private thought because of what they'll think of me.

My second phobia is so much worse. Autophobia is the fear of your friends leaving you. I'm afraid that my friends will see me as egotistical and mean, and they'll decide that they don't want me around anymore. That definitely fuels my depression. I only have two friends that this doesn't apply to.

I tell one of those friends almost everything about myself. The only things I haven't told him are my thoughts of self harm and the crappy way another ""friend"" treats me. He's my best friend, and I want to tell him everything, but talking to him isn't always an option. When my depression or Autophobia is really causing me pain, my first thought to stop the bad thoughts and crying is to talk to him.

The bad part is that I can't always talk to him. On holidays, birthdays, and weekends, I don't want to ruin his fun day with my dad crap. It hurts like hell that talking to him isn't always an option, but I want him to feel better then I do.

When I can't talk to him, I keep my mind off bad thoughts by writing. I fricking love writing with all my heart, but telling the pages of my notebook how I'm feeling doesn't always work. Sometimes it straight up backfires. And sometimes, I don't have the energy to write.

Me and my ex-husband had a relationship that was destined to fail from the beginning - I was only 17 (I'm 24 now), baby leading to shotgun wedding - and I have accepted my role in it's failure. During out marriage, he would do things such as pretend nothing was wrong until it he was at the point of resenting me and saying things that he wouldn't think was a big deal, but are still affecting my self confidence and conscience. The things he said were along the lines of he never loved me while married to me, never could take me seriously/only saw me as a 17yo the whole time. It got to the point where I would get anxious if I disagreed with him, so I did everything in my power to do what he wanted, so hopefully we stay together and ""happy"". I would get depressed knowing he was doing things outside our marriage that I didn't want him to and was left alone with our kids, then anxious every time he was around because I was afraid he would be unhappy about everything I did and said. Fast forward to now, we're divorced, I have the kids at home with me and my family across the country and I'm slowly getting my own life and confidence together. But every time I have to talk with him about our kids, I get anxious. I turn back into my old self where he is able to walk all over me and I feel powerless in the conversation.

And severe loneliness, for the longest time my therapist who said he couldnt diagnose hypothesized that I was bipolar and I cant help but agree with the amount of switches from confident to anxious and shy to depressed and lonely and just the normal mood swings is surreal, I go through a lot of depressive and manic episodes as well. I've attempted suicide once and hate that I'm thinking about it again. But at the same time I just feel like it's right. I've dealt with a lot more, girl claiming a false rape allegation so I've never had any chance at a relationship let alone me being shy, my sister being a coke machine in the streets at 16 and people in my life passing away. It's just too much.

But I also want help, if there is a clear sky at the end of this storm I want it, I'm way too anxious to pick up a phone and utter that I need an appointment with a doctor and my mom just tells me I'm an adult and need to do it. Shes right but fuck I shake and feel like I'm gonna puke it's really bad. If theres any help I can get to find the cherry blossom in the woods of dead leaves please help me.

64,"I remember entering a psych ward and being put on medications that eventually helped. They made me feel more depressed than I ever had before then and that's saying something. After a while, they calmed my mania and soothed the depression a little. When I felt strong enough, I went off them because of the side effects.

Now, about 11 months on, I feel the depression and loneliness come back in spades. It feels exactly like the feeling of getting used to the medication. Only this time, I can leave bed for work or leave bed period. Whenever I'm not with people or in public, I feel the worst feeling of loneliness. I spent an entire hour crying after meeting two friends in one day and having an actually good time. As soon as I don't have a form of contact, as soon as I'm not being touched or held by someone, I turn into a pathetic and emotional mess. 

And this what one of the main occurences when taking the medication were, I would constantly be in bed crying and curled up in a ball when I wasn't inadvertently depressing everyone around me.

I don't know if I'd call that an obsession, because it's not so often that she comes back to my mind. But I'd still prefer if i could stop thinking about it at all.

I also had a crush on a girl on high school, which started because a friend told me she had a crush on me, which could have been a joke I couldn't differentiate. The point is that I was obsessed with her from like 9th grade until recently, 3 years after finishing high school and even having moved to different countries. I didn't try to do anything with her, and if she got in a relationship I would just ""wait"" instead of trying to get someone myself and getting over her.

69,"Hey y’all. I’m currently going through a really really rough time right now. I have a neglectful and awful mother who has had lasting impacts on my mental health and well-being. I keep overthinking every little thing that comes into my head, like I’m somehow faking my emotions to myself for attention. 

One of my younger brothers has been suspended for a whole term, another one of my younger brothers is starting to follow in his foot steps and my mum is acting so strange. As well as this, the only person I trust in my house, my dad, has been yelling at me and antagonising me constantly for seemingly no reason. My home life has been pretty rough, especially when I’m expected to do all the house work, write my delinquent brothers assignments and be the verbal punching bag for my family, whilst constantly being afraid to even live in my house. 

I’m currently seeing a school counsellor and try to work through a lot of obsessive and compulsive behaviours including tics, intrusive thoughts and a bunch of other behaviours. It’s so hard to function at the moment and I keep nearly self harming. It’s so hard to not self harm, I can’t see my counsellor because I’m on holidays and I’m stuck in a house where everyone is constantly on edge and it feels like a ticking time bomb. I’ve been trying not to self harm for the sole reason that I don’t want to have to tell my partner I did it, I have a very guilty conscience and would never want to keep things from them. 

I’m just really struggling at the moment. Both of my parents cut out their extended families when they got together; it makes a lot of sense in my mums case because she genuinely doesn’t have friends and has a very mean and patronising personality, so I can’t help but think that a lot of the reason contact was cut was because of something she did. Since I don’t have any extended family, I have nowhere to go. I am not allowed to leave the house on most occasions, there is no bus stop in our suburb and I would just get punished if I tried. 

I really just need some help right now. It’s been not so great.",01Dec2019,1
70,"TL;DR at bottom.

So I’m transgender MtF and I’m attracted to the thought of being used for sex or having sex as a woman, but I’m not sure if this is abnormal for someone that happens to be trans, or abnormal for a cis woman.

I don’t know if I just like the idea of being a woman and it’s just a fetish that’s taken over my life like some people close to me suggest, which I personally don’t think, or if I’m actually a woman. I have only taken hormones so far but I want bottom surgery, I love to do my nails and currently have them long because I do them constantly and it’s therapeutic and I love the compliments and everything and I can’t do that as a guy (without being ostracized). I’m out everywhere and am living as a woman and my mental health is better for it.

During sex I prefer to be referred to as a woman and I prefer to have my chest played with, I plan to get bottom surgery but I find anything with my bottom especially PIV to be triggering, I usually masturbate by either not thinking of anything or playing with my chest, don’t know if it’s normally supposed to feel good but it does, sometimes I put my fingers under my parts and push up and the pressure makes me feel good mentally. :/ 

I want to buy a Motorcycle so that I can ride around with a friend, but I also feel like it will help me be sexy and attract guys or girls that might be attracted to a girl on a bike, because honestly I need all the help I can get. 

Do people do things like this to be attractive? Could I just be doing this because I’m attracted to the idea of myself as a female being more attractive? Is that wrong? Does that make me a horrible person?

I want to start a life married as a woman and I think all the time about the fucked up gender situation I am in and it gives me a lot of anxiety and depression.

I don’t know if I’m transgender or a really fucked up guy. I can’t tell anyone about this.

I have always been VERY depressed and suicidal, I have been in a mental hospital several times before and after I have transitioned, I just recently got really into making an exit bag but I’m having trouble buying gas. A lot of my life is consumed with suicidal thoughts and plotting with action only about 4 times a year.

I worry that I will never be happy and this has made me happier but I worry in the future if I can’t pass it will push me to the edge and I will kill myself.

I have a lot of issues including anxiety, depression, and self doubt which could be contributing, not to mention that I don’t understand how having a firm identity is supposed to feel.

I want to be normal but I’m afraid that I’m as far from normal as you could get. i dont think about this very much and just try to be happy but things remind me sometimes and i start to spiral.

I just want someone to tell me I’m not a freak, that’s all.

I could say more but I’ll just leave a TL;DR

TL;DR: I can’t figure out if I’m just a normal woman that is stuck being a man, or if I’m some kind of crazy pervert freak and I just don’t want to believe it. I think about suicide a lot.

If anyone has made it this far thanks, I really appreciate it.

71,"I’m confused. 
(I have ocd and have been on meds for over a month. )

Recently I have been dealing with some minor weird health issues, but I’m confused as to if they are actually minor. 

Ex: reacurring headaches (I never get them usually) fatigue, random sleepiness, muscle weakness, coughing, shortness of breath, upset stomach, random intense pain in my body. Also, I’ve noticed a lump in my mouth that has been there for a while but won’t go away.

Naturally, I wanted to go to the doctor because those aren’t normal. Then I started thinking that it may be a sign of something serious. But it didn’t scare me. Idk why I caught myself wishing to have some serious issue, idk why (attention, escaping my problems,...?) and the thought of eventual death doesn’t scare me at all.  And then I thought that maybe all my concerns are absolutely in legitimate and that it’s all in my head and/or due to my meds. 

Idk what to do. One part of me want to go to the doctor to get checked and the other one just want to ignore it cause I may be faking it.",01Dec2019,1
72,"It seems like there is so much more awareness about mental health now but resources are still so hard to find. Don't get me wrong there are so many different resources for so many different conditions but no one seems to know about them. For example, when I was first reaching out of help I was only told about one organisation, and when they failed me dramatically I didn't know what to do because I thought that was my only option.  


So my proposal is a website that lets you sort by country, age range, and the condition/problem you are dealing with. It could have hotlines for different countries. Different organisations that offer therapy, and places to get specialized therapy. You could find organisations the offer support for youth or adults. And it could also have articles on tips with dealing with depression, anxiety, flashbacks etc.  


This seems like such a helpful thing to have, to make it easy to learn about what resources are out there and gain access to them. I just don't understand why this doesn't exist (as far as I know) when it has the potential to save so many peoples lives.",01Dec2019,1

Super bright, so it's okay, but I have a huge mirror in it, and I had to check if there was something in it, and then I couldn't look at it afterwards. I was almost panicking.

77,"Hello,  


For context: I've been depressed in the past, but I'd say I'm over that. I've been diagnosed with generalised anxiety by three different doctors, but I think most of my symptoms are manageable, so I don't take any medication at all. I'm a masters student in pure mathematics, and I'm doing well in my courses and research, and I get along with all the colleagues that I interact with. I have a few hobbies, and I enjoy them all - so one could say I am in a fairly decent position in life, and I can't see any reason why I should feel unhappy. However, I've recently been feeling more and more generally empty. By this I mean that I can't bring myself to have strong feelings/beliefs about anything. Some example observations about myself (as of recent):  


1. I don't know how to define a friend anymore. I hang out with people outside of the academic setting, and it's enjoyable, and I find them very pleasant, and go out of my way to hang out with them, but somehow I feel like they don't matter at all.
2. People disagree/debate topics, and I can see where each of them are coming from. I can argue for either side, but I somehow don't really care about either perspective (on any topic that's come up as of recent).
3. I've always been agnostic, and played around with spiritual ideas for fun. Thinking about what form a god or gods would take - whether they can act on the universe in a way that is literally non-physical, or if the very notion of them acting on the universe makes them, by definition, physical. That sort of thing, but recently I can't see how to care about any of this at all.
4. I've had a few good relationships in the past (and still get along well with previous girlfriends that I keep in contact with), and I think I could probably get myself into another relationship without too much issue. But for some reason I have no motivation to do so. I don't see the point in trying to find a wife, or have children, or buy a house, etc. It's not that I feel negatively about any of these things, it's just that I have no desire at all. I actually really like children, and the times I've cared for nieces/nephews have been quite enjoyable.

The only thing that seems inherently interesting right now is pure mathematics, or chemistry, or physics, everything else seems completely meaningless to me. For the record, I've always been very good with people, and most people wouldn't know I feel this way at all, so I find it highly unlikely that I am on the spectrum, which this post might otherwise suggest.  


Is this a normal thing that people go through? Does it pass by itself? Should I be concerned? Is there anything I can do to fix this?",01Dec2019,1

80,"This is my first post so, hello, and thanks for reading/listening. I kind of want to give a little background on myself. I am 32, single, male, and working at a grocery store on 3rd shift. I first got hit with depression/anxiety/mood swings and social anxiety when I was about 18 but didn't really get it bad until around 20. Around 23 the woman I was seeing at the time and planning to marry dumped me and I dropped out of college. This put me on a long road of drugs/alcohol and general self hate and destruction. Around 28  I tried moving out of the state with some friends to start a new life, but unfortunately the job I had waiting for me ended up screwing me over and I started racking up debt fast. If it wasn't for my parents helping me out I would have been homeless and states away, without a doctor or medication. Well that kind of goes to what's going on today. I was able to get back home and start paying off debt, but then my car died and I ended up having to get a new vehicle, well as I said I work at a grocery store so that means I'm not getting the big bucks, so I'm making just enough to buy my own food, make car/insurance payments, pay for my phone, and other necessities but don't have enough to afford even a cheap apartment where I live unless it means I try to live with former friends who I did drugs with, which is not an option.Thankfully, again, my parents let me crash at their place, but obviously at my age this is not a confidence booster whatsoever. I'm just in  a tough place at the moment because I can't really start a relationship because pretty much any woman I talk to will immediately stop after I tell her I live at my parents house, I barely have enough energy to go to work as it is, let alone get a second job like I really want to, and I don't really have anyone to talk to anymore. I have a lot of anger and embarrassment with myself which doesn't help my self esteem and while I want to be social my mental health stuff always seems to stop me one way or another. I've tried multiple spiritual practices and regardless of what God I prayed to or new people I tried to meet I always felt judged or looked at like a loser.  I just feel like I had this moment in my life in my high school/college years where life was so set up to be great and then it all crumbled and Ive been constantly trying to climb out of a deep hole ever since just to fall back down again. I know people don't want to hear others complain about their lives and someone else out there always has it worse, but I'm just so stuck right now and I don't know what to do.

I grew up with many voices.

many of these voices that i would consider to be DEMONS.

i thank by all reasoning and respect for MY god, that i am where i am today because i had a strong mental capacity to study my own thought processes and evaluate my progress in life to be a good noble human being exercising proper judgement.

Every possible crime you could think of would linger in my mind and taunt me to be like them with their reasonings and perceptions on what is right for me.

i always held my ground and fought back these voices.

i would always in the furthest darkest reaches in my mind envision ways i would defeat this demon peacefully and mutually to an agreement where it would leave me alone.

i would always go out into the real world and try to prove to these demons that i am not this type of character that it is trying to mold me into.

eventually these demons and evil desires deminished and i became a human with a great desire to destroy these kinds of forces.

soon the demonic voices were replaced with very complimenting pleasant toned voices that i would like to call angels.

they would always come in and support me when i felt low.

all i have now

is a devil.

a devil that tries to be my friend.

when infact i know its intentions is to betray me as soon as i trust it.

Like today at work it was unusually quite and we had a lot of free time,  I was kinda just doing a bunch of weird sounds then started getting in a discussion with my colleague and she stuttered on a word and I just couldn't control imitating the stuttering it's so embarassing. Like if I went to hold back stuttering id feel it in my throat again and then it would just come out.  

If I have my boss there and I feel forced to hold it in, I tend to manage but have to take a few bathroom breaks which looks quite suspicious just so I can let it out and keep what little sanity I still have",01Dec2019,1
95,"So I’m 15 and I’m a dude. I recently bought myself a butterfly knife and sent a picture of it to a friend of mine since he wanted to know what it looked like. My dad (who is very controlling and let’s me have now privacy whatsoever) looked through my messages and saw the picture I sent. He then came into my room in the middle of the fucking night to confront me about it. I woke up but I’m very groggy and tired at this point. He starts making accusations and saying I’m going to murder him in his sleep. My step-mother comes in ( same as dad. My parents are divorced) and she says she no longer feels safe living in the same house as me blah blah blah. She then sends the picture of the knife to the freaking POLICE. Her reasoning was “Just in case something happens to me, your father or your half-brother, you’re the one they’re coming after.” I’m taken back from this. I’ve never hurt anybody, I just got the knife since I was supposed to go hunting with some friends soon and had no intention of using it until I had to skin something. But since my dads a dumbass he thinks I’m planning to kill my whole family. He literally just left my room the day after he came into my room and accuses me of being a psychopath. And since I’m very self conscious and emotionally sensitive, I broke down as soon as he left my room and I’m very scared of myself currently. I’m contemplating suicide right now and I need to know what to do. I trust this subreddit so much that I’m leaving my decision up to you. Please help!!",01Dec2019,1

98,"If you’re reading this, I’ve done something wrong then or you’re just snooping around in my phone. If that’s the case then the things you’ll read are not meant for children. If you are a child then get a parent around. Lol

Day 1
The thoughts I have are starting to get to me. I just wanna break down and crawl into a ball and cry. I showed my emotions a few times and became vulnerable. I’m starting to get sad all the time from these thoughts. I don’t know what to do. I hope writing this down helps but I don’t think it will. It just keeps building up. I’m going to snap at some point and do something I’ll regret. I have to hold back my anger so I don’t lose it and hurt people I care the most. But it sucks when those same people that you care about make you feel this way. It’s not entirely they’re fault though. I keep getting reminded of what my loved ones have done in the past. I don’t know if I should feel this way over things I have no control over. I feel hopeless. Like I can’t achieve anything. Yet at the time I’m at my happiest I’ve ever been. I start the day off being happy then I slowly descend into a void of nothingness and begin to feel like I can’t do anything right. Am I at fault for what is happening around me? Do I deserve all of this? Maybe I do. Maybe it’s just karma for something I HAVE done. These are the thoughts I have every single day. I tear myself down. I feel like I’m not good for anyone. Yet people still “love” me. Maybe it’s just a facade if that’s even the right word. Maybe it’s just an act. I’m not sure. I’ve felt that way about everything for my whole life. I NEED HELP. I know where to get it yet I don’t. I need to ask but I can’t talk. I feel like everyone is against me. Plotting on me. Spreading RUMOURS. This is my headspace. Maybe other people feel the same way about themselves. I try to help other people but I can’t even help myself. I just want to go. Get away. Die. Then be reincarnated as the perfect human. A good looking person with friends that care. Wealthy. Smart. Funny. Handsome. Reading back of what I wrote really tells me that there is something wrong with me. I need help. ASAP. I’m not worth a cent. Not even a thought . So much emotional stress. I can let it all go but I can’t . I’ve got something I haven’t had in a long time and I don’t want to let go. But if I do all my problems with fade away. I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’m better off dead. I’m not worth it. Voices are telling me to do it. To off myself. It’s horrible. Suicide. I don’t want to but I’m might have to. No one will be reading this unless if I do it. My thoughts. Wrote down. Just for me to see. But why write them down when they are in my HEAD 24/7. I feel loved yet hated. So many thoughts. Why? I’m sick. The pain will go soon. I have to stay strong for now. For people. People that “care” about me. I don’t know. Everyday I put on a mask and feel all nice and dandy. Why did it take this long for mental health to be addressed and acted on? Does no one really care for the future? I feel wanted yet rejected. The sad thing is JOKER really spoke to me. Brilliant movie. Just the RAWness from it. The story of metal health and how THOUGHTS break someone down and turn them into a monster. Is that happening to me? I don’t want to be a monster. Should I stop myself now? Should I continue to live and watch myself slowly descend into a darkness I can never go back from? Maybe I’m already there. I just don’t know it yet. When would I be able to know? Maybe when it’s too late. Maybe just before I take my last breath. Then BANG. Darkness. Nothing. Yet everything. Life. Death. Am I here for a purpose? I’m so frustrated. I’m happy yet sad. I don’t wanna use the word “DEPRESSED”. There is a stigma around it. I TRY to make everyone else happy and laugh so I don’t let them sink into the void. Urge. Do it they say. NOW. Loud. Scary.  

Day 2
Can I force myself to think differently? My life is hanging on by a thread. GET THE SCISSORS they say. Cut. Feel happy. Feel loved. Feel pain. Can’t believe I wrote so much depressing stuff. Is this like a diary? Much prefer to call it a journal. Will I ever share this? Maybe if I become famous for something then maybe I will and let everyone tune into my ILL MIND. I know I’m gonna have a good day. But after it all I wonder if I could of done it better. 

Day 5 (I think)
Ouch, that hurt a lot. Sorry I’m not good enough. Sorry I’m not experienced. Sorry I’m not up to your standards. Why even bother with me then. If you’re just gonna play around with me, just finish it. Stop wasting both of our time. You say you’re sorry but I think differently. Maybe someone is in between us. I don’t want to believe that but I’m starting too. If that happens that i don’t know what I’ll do. I won’t harm you in any way. It’s my fault anyway. I’m not wanted. Throw me out. Fucking kill me. Please. Make it quick. KILL ME. Please. Too much pain. I’m numb. Hang me. Or should I do it and not bother you. I was worried sick. If yous did anything over there. I’m done. That’s when I’ll go. For good. I’ll run. Or not. Maybe I’ll just disappear. I’m not joking either. I’m being full serious right now. I can’t deal with this shit. Too much suffering. Why can’t you teach me to love? I’m might do it. I just need a plan. So no one finds me. I’ll be out of everyone’s lives. So much emotional strain. I can’t deal with it anymore. Fuck. I’m going to do it. I can’t live anymore. I feel sick. I want to die. I hate this place and these feelings. 

Day 7
I now have hope again

Day 14 
Sike, hope is gone again. 

Day ?
We’re done. She ended it

Day ?
From the end of September to the 1st of December has been one hell of a roller coaster. Practically 3 months of Ups and Downs. From losing friends to gaining new ones. It’s was one amazing journey. I feel like I’ve changed into a complete different person, for good and bad reasons. From having a heartthrob then having a heartbreak. Sometimes you just need to look at the much bigger and grander overall picture. I’m faced with one big choice. To follow my heart or my gut. To follow myself or others. It’s really hard. I don’t know what I’ll choose. It’s like life or death. Maybe not really but you know what I mean. I hope I choose the better choice that makes me happier in the long run. It’s still hurts. Just think happy thoughts. Have you had any negative thoughts? All I have are negative thoughts.",01Dec2019,1
99,"Over the last 2y I've struggled a lot with depression and anxiety. It peaked after regularly working 80h weeks and never investing in my mental health or social relations. I feel like I've learned a lot through different schools of therapy, spiritualities, current research, and even shamanism. But also I'm just really fucking afraid of losing touch with the insights that once felt meaningful.

Through all this journey, I've come more and more to realize, that I might want to make mental health a priority not just for my personal well-being, but also with regards to helping others. Once you realize how a big part of (our Western) society is truly struggling, maybe not even conscious of it, and a lot of mechanisms in our economy/society actually fueling this, it really makes me want to support to relieve this suffering.

For the above reasons, and because it helps me process things myself, I want to take a first step in the direction and start writing a bit about things I think about or that have helped me. Not sure where the journey will go, but (also on a mission of overthinking less) it feels good to do this right now.

Here are two texts I've written so far.

* [Emergency tactics for taking back control in the moment](https://medium.com/@danvalenzuela/tools-for-taking-back-control-in-the-moment-6173d38dc47b)
* [A powerful technique for caring less about what other people think and for deepening friendships](https://medium.com/@danvalenzuela/a-powerful-technique-for-caring-less-about-what-other-people-think-and-for-deepening-friendships-7a5d7c38f8e1)

I'd really love to discuss the ideas here or privately, in case you want to talk. Feedback to everything always appreciated.

Big hug &amp; best of luck to everyone on their journey!",01Dec2019,1

But yeah, something I've noticed my boyfriend do during sex is blame me? Like, we're in the middle of doing it and he'd say something like it's my fault he's so worked up. It makes me feel weird, definetly not good. I think it's some form of dirty talk but honestly I don't know. I think I'm overthinking it. 

But outside the bedroom he's pretty okay, hes never abusive so that's good for me, lol. I dunno if it'll help but I have an extensive history of abuse and everything.",01Dec2019,1

I want to help but honestly right now i’m not in a place to be able to help and even if I do I dont think I have the capacity. I’m really concerned since he is very suicidal. I have recommended him getting professional help but he is scared because of his preference about girls. His mental health rn is really about loneliness and because he cant seem to find someone which fits his criteria to like or like him back (i’m pretty sure its more complicated than that but thats what i understand for now). 

His type of girls are skinny small cute girls which for you folks who like japanese stuff refer to lolis. He is not interested to actual children, he just like that specific body type. He’s very scared that when he refers to a professional he will end up being listed in the pedo list or end up in jail. Which I cant comprehend because he havent done anything wrong, then why would he be treated so badly.

I’m not sure what to do because the cycle goes on and i really think he needs help. Is it actually possible to be in the government’s watch just by seeking professional help?",01Dec2019,1

105,"  First day on this sub as I usually come to Reddit to decompress from life. A tiny back story for my question. At age 4 my son was diagnosed with  oppositional defiant disorder and started therapy around 7. He has rage issues. In second grade he was delusional in thinking if he killed us he could go into foster care and get all the consoles and games around. Defiance and difficulty for a few years before he became violent in 6th grade. Hit an adult family member in anger. Started meds and extra therapy. 7th grade ok,lots of suspensions. 8th grade pretty terrible and by the end he'd been in the psychiatric hospital 2 times for rage fighting(hitting his dad and I) and suicidal/homicidal thoughts. In the last month of school he was expelled for the rest of the year and next.

 This year of homeschooling has not gone well. He will not do the work and for the last week or so does not want to take meds. When we go to his doctors tomorrow (we see both his psychiatrist and psychologist) I am pretty sure they will recommend residential treatment.  I am nervous about it and wondered if anyone had any experience good or bad ?   A tiny tidbit about my son,he is smart,funny and caring. He feels really bad about his rage when its over,for hurting us and the consequences of his actions. He is not a sociopaths or a psychopath because he has empathy for strangers and  people he cares for,although there are not many. He has not been abused in anyway and is in a loving home. His current diagnoses are conduct disorder with low pro-social emotions and severe depressive disorder. Any advice would be appreciated. 
TL/DR: Son may be put into residential treatment,any advice? Pro or cons ?",01Dec2019,1

Head  over and be a part of the journey towards the restoration of physical,  mental, emotional and spiritual health. You'll especially find our  TED-styled talk quite engaging, and interesting.

107,"Hey all, I am a CS student and I've been following mental health-related subs for a while now. I am thinking about making an app which caters to people who actually have bad mental health but keep on putting a facade. People generally are apprehensive about talking about what they are actually going through or sometimes simply can't express themselves. I'm actually out of ideas for the app, some of the ideas that I'd written on paper but ended up throwing 'em in the bin are:

* Making an AI-based chatbot which people can chat with while being completely anonymous.
* Making a Global message space where people can post about themselves, what they are going through and all completely anonymously. On the backend, we will have real psychologists who would be pick up a post, read it and then will talk to the person who posted it over DM.
* Making a first check app which will ascertain if people really have mental health problems or if it's just because of temporary anxiety or fear. The structure of this app will be based on a decision graph which will have many pathways to reach a few defined outcomes (again this will be AI-based having feedback loops to train the AI). 

The thing I want to address the most is to make the people express themselves in ways they have never thought of before and taking out their underlying fears and problems. But as I've already told, I am out of ideas. 

Any help or Idea in this regard will be highly appreciated.",01Dec2019,1
108,"My therapist told me last session that it’s easy to be mad but it takes strength to be sad. And right now I’m just really sad. 

One of my friends flakes all the time. And I understand why she does it. Like I really do. She gets sick easy and she’s depressed like the rest of us and I get it. Sometimes u just can’t go out. But like sometimes I need to go out with my friends. And my friends mean a lot to me.

Today we were supposed to drive my sister back up to college. It’s a 5 hour drive up and 5 1/2 back. And I didn’t want to do it by myself. So she offered. But I get a text an hour before we’re supposed to leave saying that she’s sick and can’t go. And for some reason this just hit me. My mom ended up driving my sister and I ended up crying in my car getting coffee.

I don’t know why this hit me so hard. But I was looking forward to it and then. Now I’m sitting here with the family dog just sad with nothing to do. I haven’t texted her back cause I don’t know what to say that won’t come off mean. Cause I don’t want her to feel bad but at the same time I wish she understood that it hits me whenever she does this. And I know that I need to talk to her about this but I can’t do it now cause she won’t be able to go out to talk but ugh. 

I just needed to get this out even tho she knows what my reddit account is. So she can probably read this and that’s the last thing I need but. I don’t know. I hate this. I haven’t seen my therapist in 2 weeks and it’s showing. Ugh

She tells me I have to get out of the house, I agree and make plans and then when the time comes for me to get out of the house she suddenly has plans for us to go to Costco or something she wants to do. She rolls her eyes when I cry about how lonely I am. She tells me that I need to do something about my depression and then makes me fight trying to find time within her schedule just to do these things. She is the complete opposite of support. I want to kill myself more when she is around me just because of her utter lack of consideration and empathy. I took this relationship too far. In the beginning I had to fight for my own autonomy with her. I couldn't so much as read a book while she watched a movie. I spent 6 years of my life thinking that if we learn to communicate better things will be alright. But thats not an option with her, that is apparent. I've been through so much shit, supporting her through so much fucked up shit from her family. But my feelings don't matter because she doesn't agree with them and I blow them out of proportion, I guess. Now I am trapped with someone who could care less about how she makes me feel.

i meet almost every symptom and have been for the last two years- they were just much quieter before but now theyre controlling my life.
everything i do i overthink and translate into me being a bad person and not deserving anything and never finding love or friendship. (and i think posting this is awful cause indont deserved isndekdnde ehfbdiuvk [ok fuck i stg that wasnt intentional i just got gritty at myself thinking it was selfish to think anybody would pity me, i swear this isnt for attention i iust want somebody to know) i sometimes even want an ed so that someone will care for me or give me attention. 
iv never been able to out my mind into words, but recently iv been trying to. its kind of an obsession- i dont know who i am so im constantly saying to myself that whatever im doing makes me an *insert type of person here*.  but everything i do is selfish, rude, apethetic, mean, etc. 
like everything i do think or say about people i believe is attention seeking and faked, but then i think saying that its attentionseeking/faked is also attention seeking etc, and that im really not a nice person so i shouldnt be treated as such (that thought fired up when i gave a seat to my cousin cause she wanted to sit there.)

im on new antidepressants started taking CBD and trying very hard to have a new outlook on life, trying very hard to be positive and ... it's knda working?

now unfortunately, things with my girlfriend bring me down a lot.

as i said we are long distance, she asked me to come see her, she needed me she wasn't good at all.

i just spent the week with her. we barely talked. we would just watch series/movies together and during the day she had to go to school. sex was pretty bad. on the last day she started to ignore me, i joined her in bed and she didnt want me there, then i said i was going out since she didnt want to and i spent money to come here i wasnt gonna spend my week doing nothing. she started crying, i told her to talk to me and she said she didnt want me here. so i packed my bags, was terrified but ready to leave, because i thought that was what she wanted. then i sat on her bed and told her ""if i leave like that that's probably the last time we'll see each other"" she cried, asked her again to talk to me. she just pointed at me to join her in bed. so like obviously i cried too, i was confused but relieved. 

she says i deserve better, she doesn't love me properly, she's too mean to me. and honestly i couldnt contradict her, thats true, except the part on deserving i dont think anyone deserves anything. but she said she needs me, she loves me and i feel the same way. i told her to please stop being so hard on me and on her, being tolerant of others and of herself. she is just so harsh on herself and everyone else. she is also so secretive, she just pushes people away all the time and doesnt want to show vulnerabilty. she told me thats what happened with her exes and she is doing it again with me and she doesn't think she can change. then we cried like two hours lol and said  we can go out, we went on a walk, went to a market and drank wine that was nice, she even held my hand (rare for lesbians cause it's dangerous).

then i left on the evening told her i love you she said it back.

but now, less than 24hours later she started acting badly again, we were playing video games with her friends and i simply corrected her on the time and she messaged me ""stop contradicting me in front of my friends or i will break up no problem"" 

and now here i am, dont know how to act or feel anymore i am so confused

He had been staying in Motels, but recently told me that his medical leave pay is running out and that he was kicked out of the motel. For a bit of background, he was hospitalized in the summer for a terrible infection in his arm. He told me many stories about how it happened, and after much badgering finally admitted that it was from IV drug use. He has been an addict (alcohol, rx pain killers, marijuana, cocaine etc, etc) for his entire adult life. My mother left him because of it, he spent their entire life savings on oxycontin. My sister has disowned him and moved to another city. He has burned every single bridge he's ever had. His siblings want nothing to do with him as he is incredibly difficult and abusive. Some background on me: single mother to 2 young boys, left an abusive relationship with their father 3 years ago and have struggled with anxiety since my teens. I have finally gotten to a point where my life is less stressful and my anxiety has lessened to the point where I don't need medication. Just eating well, sleeping well and exercising. Now that this situation with my father has arisen, my stress levels have skyrocketed, I'm not sleeping and I feel myself slipping back into severe anxiety.

I wouldn't be able to go outside, I wasn't allowed to see anyone, I was barely allowed to speak to anyone other than the other patients and nurses. I was eating hospital food, which obviously was disgusting. They were medicating me, which I was adamantly against. I had never been on medication before that point. 

I was completely alone. Or so I thought. 

Little did I know, I would meet some of the most incredible people during my stay. One of them just so happens to be my closest friend now. 

I'm currently still in outpatient treatment. And I've learned a lot, but I've also lost a lot since then. 

I'm single for the first time since I was 16 years old, and I live alone now. I've never lived alone. It's just me and my three cats. 

It gets really lonely sometimes. But I know this is for the best, and I know that I need to do this because if I don't, I'll never heal.

I'm 52 days sober. Completely sober. Sober, single, medicated and living alone.  All things I never thought I would do.",01Dec2019,1
122,"First time poster. 27 years of age. I am and have been suffering with chronic physical pain, alongside OCD. I suspect fibromyalgia with EDS. The pain has and is making my life intolerable. I'm losing the ability to do things I used to, and my days are becoming far more restrictive. The thought of living like this for the rest of my life terrifies me and panics me. 

I want to be better, but the doctors cant seem to help. Everything so far has yielded nothing. My health has been deteriorating for the past 8 months and I'm fed up and I feel it will never get better. I cant live like this knowing I'm young and it will only get worse as I get old. At the same time, I want to live, love my partner and be the happy me again that I used to be.

123,"Hi, Im very new to this subreddit, and Im very bad at writing/expressing my thoughts, so my apologies if this makes no sense.

Im an art student and for the last two years(one year barely going, the last year i took time off) Ive been going through a major depression. Ive had depression and anxiety for most of my life, but these past 2 years took a big HIT for me. I took a very light job at a nearby cafe, working 1 day a week or so, and mostly spent time trying to    idk be happy? i guess?

I feel like art is my only passion, but i feel so untalented especially compared to the kids around me. I considered suicide a few times because i felt like there was nothing for me to look forward to with my untalented ass(and also i felt left behind from my friends who were getting jobs.) but I was too scared to ever go through with it.

This year my mental state got better, and i went back to school. First semester was fine, it was rough but i still had fun. But since October those feelings are coming back again, and I havent been able to go to school.

Im sorry for my long rambling, but what i wanted to ask was if there are cycles to depression like this, and if there are any advices you can give me. Or maybe anyone whos going through something similar. Thanks a lot.",01Dec2019,1
124,"I (F20) understand if the title makes no sense, but let me explain. I've been in a long distance relationship with a girl (F23) for about a year now. I've been in love before, but never like this. With her I've experienced a connection I've never felt with anyone else, I just love her so so much. It's more than just ""being in love"", I feel like I've found my soulmate. I don't plan on leaving her and I can't even stand the thought of doing so. 

Now to my concerns. My girlfriend has been dealing with some things in her life. She was (often brutally) bullied frequently from the age of 6-20. Her parents, that she still lives with ( average age of moving out in her country is about 29 years, she's not able to move out yet), are kinda emotionally abusive and really controlling. My girlfriend has been dealing with depression and an eating disorder for many years, and sadly she had attempted suicide with different intensities more several times. The last time was this year actually. She goes to therapy and tells me that she's scared of her ED, says things like ""I don't want to die"" etc. So it's not like she's 100% suicidal all the time. She also claims that she has been much worse and that last year was even worse than this. 

When things are great, things are great. She's awesome and when I'm with her I feel like...everything's just fantastic. But the problem is that I sometimes struggle and feel very anxious about the whole suicide thing. I've been feeling calmer for a few weeks now (probably because it seems like she's doing pretty great), but sometimes I feel so scared and anxious that she'll attempt suicide again (and maybe even succeed). She says that she can't promise me 100% that she'll never attempt again, but that she'll do her best.

So the problem is that I'm so scared of losing her sometimes. When I imagine how I would feel if anything happened I just... I would be crushed and destroyed on the inside. I can't stand the thought of losing her. But I absolutely don't want to break up with her, because I love her so much and I feel like she's my perfect match. Is it a ""bad thing"" to be together with someone who can't promise me 100% to never attempt suicide again?",01Dec2019,1

136,"I had an adverse reaction to prescription medication and wound up being held involuntary, I had a choice to go voluntary but I didn’t know the difference. It’s been years later, I feel fine, and this was a one-time episode. 

From my research, an involuntary stay completely fucks you up in terms of future jobs. I wanted to be a doctor, that’s next to impossible as you have to disclose your mental honesty history. The boards can deny you accreditation based on mental health history, and if you lie they can take away your license if found out. 

This is the same with being a Lawyer, applying for security background checks, and many other professions that have a licensing board. Even being a truck driver, you will be automatically denied if you want your hazmat cert. Military will deny you as well. 

I guess this is just a pointless rant from an Ivy League student who feels everything they wanted in life has been ripped away due to a one-time involuntary stay.

137,"Hi, I'm 18 and female, I haven't seen anyone but my family doctor who is convinced I'm schizophrenic. I, too, have thought this for about a year, but my boyfriend (more important than my narcissistic mom) doesn't think I am. He sways towards likely being some sort of bipolar (his mom is, sister has ADHD, he has a more mild ADHD). I'm not asking to be diagnosed, but I just wanted to vent a little about how hard it is to not know what is wrong with you. 

My boyfriend \[18\] doesn't try to diagnose me at all, but whenever it somewhat comes up in conversation, he leaves me confused with what really is wrong with me. To him, I have sociopathic traits and just don't seem all that schizophrenic. I do take Quetiapine, Venlafaxine, and ""the pill"". I also tend to not be able to sleep at night due to severe insomnia that wakes me up about every 30 minutes no matter what I try. So a little introduction there, I also experience visual hallucinations, sometimes auditory, along with paranoia, lack of emotion, etc.

This is why I thought I was schizo, but naturally, I can't diagnose myself.

138,"Hi

I never had friends in school. My parents had a terrible marriage and i became really closed in school. Also rude and sarcastic. 

Therefore, I have no childhood friends. Literally no one I went to school for 16 years wants to hang out with me. 

I accepted that. I mean partly my fault based on the behaviour I exhibited. And I can’t change the past. 

I moved to another city when I got my first job and made a few friends. I have one friend who I speak to once or twice a year from there. The rest are forgotten, have their own lives. 

I moved back to my home city and spent 3-4 years dating a girl. She became my best friend. We broke up a year ago. Never spoke again. 

Since the break up I tried everyday to make new friends. I’ve networked, made lots of acquaintances etc. but no real friends. 

When I’m feeling depressed or insecure about something the only thing I can do is manage it by myself. I can’t reach out to these people. 

Lately if I don’t get called for plans I’m afraid I’ll lose whatever connection I have with them. 

Also I made a few friends with some girls and we hooked up, and then I wanted to just be friends so they don’t treat me the same anymore. Basically I was treated amazingly well when I was open to sleeping with them but when I don’t want to sleep with them suddenly they don’t want to hang out as much. 

The girls I’m interested aren’t interested in me. The friends I sort of have I’m afraid of losing.

142,"Hi.  F19 here. 

I have been struggling so much mentally.  I don’t know what to do so I’m going to try my best to explain everything.  

First off, I am a nervous wreck.  I worry about anything and everything, and I wish that I didn’t.  It affects my life so much..makes it very difficult to live in the moment because all I do is worry about the future.  The solution is simple right? “Just don’t worry so much”, “Live in the present, stop worrying about the future”.  It’s easier said than done.  I constantly have these thoughts swirling around my head and I can’t seem to make them go away.  I also feel like everything is my fault and one of the things I hate the most is causing people grief.  I don’t want to be disliked.  As much as I wish I didn’t care, I do.  Not about strangers, but about those who I care about.  I disappoint my family a lot and that KILLS me.  I also disappoint my boyfriend.  I have a constant fear that they will begin to dislike me.  I hate being the stereotypical “crazy girlfriend”, but I constantly worry about my boyfriend losing feelings for me, and I always bring things up to him and annoy him about it.  I know that he hates it but I want to be reassured sometimes.  It’s hard.  Especially right now because we’re in an awkward spot.  I know that in the long run it doesn’t matter...Things might turn out okay and breaking up or losing a friend would be hard but it wouldn’t be the end of the world!  The problem is that I can’t seem to convince myself of that.  My worries get the better of me and all I feel is impending doom.  It makes it so I can’t concentrate on anything other than that problem.  I feel like the world is caving in on me and it’s all my fault.  I am tired of disappointing others and disappointing myself.  I don’t always make decisions that are the best for me because my judgement is clouded and I want to do what makes my parents or my boyfriend happy.  I rarely do what makes me happy and as selfish as this is to say, I get pissed off that it always goes unnoticed and these people don’t realize what I do for them and that it may not seem like a big deal to them but it feels like a huge sacrifice for me.  But I still can’t make everyone happy.  Especially not myself.  I have never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and I am very reluctant to consult my doctor about it.  I have been extremely suicidal in the past, especially over last summer, and some days I want nothing more than to be dead.  I don’t expect anyone to know what to say or how to help me, but I still wanted to put this out there.

144,"Sorry for the book I'm about to write. If you want to skip right to the question, go to the last paragraph.

Let me preface this by saying that I was fully aware of BetterHelp's rocky reputation when I went into it. One day I found myself at the end of my rope and was desperate enough to try anything. I cant afford therapy and even if I could, I most likely wouldn't go anyway due to not wanting my loved ones to know I'm struggling. I also know that the first advice anyone offers is to tell your loved ones. The simple fact is that I only trust two people. My best friend and my father. My friend has been suicidal for years, and for the first time in the 15 or so years that ive known him, he's happy. I will not be the one to drag him back into the hell he's escaped from. My Father was heavily effected by the loss of my brother, and again, I refuse to be the one to make him think his remaining son is in danger. I just cant bring myself to involve either of them in this. 

Given this, I decided to seek a way to try and get therapy without having to let them know and in a way that I wouldn't be ruined financially. That lead me to BetterHelp. Now again I know that it doesn't have the best reputation, but I was desperate and for the first month is was just cheap enough where I wouldn't be in trouble if I tried it for a month.

In the end I came to the conclusion that it just wasn't helping and did not have much faith it was going to. For me, it wasn't worth giving it more time and money. The first Counselor I spoke to gave me a feeling that I wasn't a priority for her, her responses seemed half-hearted and rehearsed. I decided to swap counselor's and try again. The second one felt like she was more interested in helping, but in the end it felt like it was just affirmations of my thoughts and feelings instead of offering suggestions on how to improve. I spoke to her for over a month and what I got out of it was a realization that my mental instability and hardships are my own fault. Which I would honestly say that realizing this is a good thing, since I now know what I should focus on, but I have no idea how to address it other than lying to myself.

Anyway. The other take away I got from this is that real, in person therapy is the only way I can hope to get some assistance. Given my earlier explanation as to why, I dont think that I will ever find the courage to go. But it did raise a question. I have been having suicidal thoughts for years. I have never felt they are something I would ever act on, as I couldn't do that to my loved ones. But that doesn't stop me from thinking it every second of the day. One second I'll be driving in the next ill be fantasizing about plowing my car into a tree and letting all my troubles go, I almost feels at ease when I have these fantasies. It's like an infection. This is something I never brought up in my brief time with online counseling. They make you enter your full name and home address when signing up, explicitly for the reason of sending the authorities if they think you intend to harm yourself. 

My question is, in therapy, what happens if you divulge suicidal thoughts to your therapist? Even if you don't have a plan? It's something I would have, or would like to talk about, but I'm afraid that if I did, it would have caused a disruption in my life. Like having the cops sent, or having them contact my loved ones and outed me. What happens in that situation?",01Dec2019,1
145,"A few days ago I went on a trip with one side of my Grandparents to a NFL football game out of state, but during the trip they act very strange. They forgot things that they should have easily known as this trip was planned for months. An example was my Grandma asked if we were rooting for the Bears, a team not even close to who was playing. Also they would repeatedly ask the same question several times even though I had just answered them. They would also say random things out of the blue that they normally wouldn't say, and their mannerisms were quite different. It felt super uncanny to me as they did do a few things normally, but things like that just didn't feel right. This was the first time I wanted to go home.

146,"I’ve (26f) been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while now. I think it started at 16 from the earliest I can remember. I was in an abusive relationship where he had all the control. I feel like that manifests as extreme control issues now. If I ever feel like I don’t have control in a situation (needing to be the driver, needing to have absolute knowledge of the plans for the night, needing the house to be in perfect order at all times, etc etc) I get really set off and I notice myself lashing out at whoever I perceive as trying to take the power from me. I know this is not effective or sustainable but I also can’t see a world where I would be okay letting others make decisions for me. 

When I was about 22, I hit peak anxiety after being drugged and sexually assaulted a year before and wouldn’t leave my room because I was convinced that any action I made would snowball into someone dying at my hands or me dying from something out of my control. I didn’t go to work, I didn’t talk to family, any friends I talked to I was a total bitch towards so they would leave me alone and I wouldn’t inadvertently hurt them. 

From there, I realized that life wasn’t sustainable so I went to therapy and got prescribed Lexapro. I saw a little improvement with that. I would describe it as wearing training wheels, I wouldn’t be winning any tournaments but I was able to get from point A to point B which is what I needed. 

I don’t think I was really receptive to therapy because I didn’t know the therapist and I didn’t want to open up to her from some fear in the back of my mind. I feel like she always just agreed with me which isn’t helpful but it was my first time in therapy so I thought that’s just how it was. 

All this to say, I don’t think I’ve ever gotten mental health help that actually helped me to get to where I was before any of this happened. I used to be so passionate about everything. I loved writing and playing music and connecting with friends and family and all of that is gone and I don’t know how to get it back.

I’ve slowly becoming less and less active in university, I’m 3 assignments behind and a lot more coming up, and the stress is unbelievable. I want to drop out and chase what I really want to do but my parents arnt too happy with me dropping out, I’ve had a conversation with them in the past about it.


I’ve also been having relationship problems with my girlfriend of nearly 4 years. We’ve recently entered an open relationship which is pulling us further apart but it’s necessary that we do this. 

I’ve only ever had 2 anxiety attacks that I can remember. However, I’ve had anxiety everyday for a about a month or so, and it feels like it’s getting worse.

Within the next few months time I can only see this getting worse. 

I’ve stopped going to the gym a lot and started eating junk food more, I know that’s not doing me any favours.

Depression is a disease. It’s an illness. It’s a parasite. It always has a grip on you matter how hard you try, sometimes it loosens its grip, but it’s still there regardless. It influences every decision, every action, every aspect of life, from the smallest of things like not having the motivation to brush your teeth to not showing up to class for an entire semester. It can affect your memory, attention, and intelligence. It can reduce the happiest, most optimistic person into an emotionless shell of their former selves. It can completely transform you in the worst way possible. It can ruin your life. It can end your life. It can ruin every relationship you have. It can ruin your appetite. It can ruin your sleep. It can ruin all your dreams and aspirations. It can ruin everything. It has ruined everything.",01Dec2019,1

158,"I am seriously considering suicide and self harm. This has never gone so far and I'm at a loss.

I've been feeling like this for years but I've always been able to hold it together and enjoy life. I can't anymore. I told my boyfriend how I felt hoping it would make it better, he is very supportive and we love each other alot but it got worse. For the last weeks I've had more panic attacks than during my whole life. I've been crying nonstop and today has been the lowest, I finally realized there is no way out for me, I am so scared.

My bf is in the army and I see him twice or thrice a month, I have no one else to talk to. I'm not close with my family, they know nothing about me and I've pushed away all my friends and tbh I don't care. I haven't cared for that in a long time, I get bored after a few texts and just want to ignore people. I have never felt like friends or family help me. I'm also currently living by myself in a big apartment, alone with my thoughts all day. I don't go out or to uni because showing up isn't mandatory and I also don't study at home, so basically I'm gonna drop out soon.

Before you say go to therapy, I already have a doctor's appointment and he can transfer me but it will be at least March until my first session. I know I'm not going to last that long. I am just so broken right now, I wish so bad that my relationship would give me a will to live, but it hasn't and I hate it. I want to continue life and feel and give love but I just can't, I just can't and I feel like nothing helps anymore, I've pushed it too far. It hurts so bad because I see how bad my boyfriend takes this.

I'm going to self harm, that's the only thing that stops me from hours of crying and hyperventilating, it's not going to help for long and I am scared to think how this is going to end. I don't know what to do and I'm so sorry",01Dec2019,1

(omitting personal details)  
Someone I don’t really know very well made an instagram post on a private spam account account (~150 followers) detailing their struggles with coming out as LGBT and their issues with suicide relating to that. They said that they weren’t very suicidal anymore but still have lasting mental health issues and are sometimes suicidal. My question is how would I respond, if at all? The person and I have been friendly to each other in the past and have spoken several times but I really don’t know them. I’ve been debating about sending them a message but I’m really not sure if it would even be in my place to do so. I would just hate for them to post something needing support and then feeling as if no one cares, but I do care (they disabled comments on the post so I wouldn’t know if anyone else has said anything to them).

161,"Some Background. I work at restaurant in the Midwest. Decently low staff only about 20-25 people, everyone there is pretty close knit. About 4 months ago, we hired a new girl, let's call her Val. So Val works a full time job at a hospital close by and is only schedule to come in on weekends. So i only see her about once maybe twice a week. In the past couple weeks Val and I have been getting to know each other better; talking for hours, getting high and driving around, stuff like that. Nothing too out of the ordinary, I thought she was just getting interested in me at first. But after talking around at work with some guys I've known for years and hang out with on a regular basis I've learned that she's been doing this with a lot of others that work with us. All guys. I'm not one to get out the house much so even if she wasn't interested it was nice to have a good friend around. But this weekend something seemed really off, she always seemed like one of the happiest person I've ever met. Yesterday she was not talking to anyone, insanely tired the one day she was there this weekend and even blew me off last night when she really wanted to hang out a few hours before. We do a secret Santa every year and i was trying to trade with someone to get Val, after talking about with a good friend at work he said that she's got some serious shit going on right now. No details anyone knows of. Talked to another guy that's been hanging out with Val about an hour or so later. He was talking about some texts Val sent him this morning about she just wants to drive to another city 2 hours away get a motel and have a breakdown. She didn't show up to work today. She was schedule to come in and 4 pm and i left at 4 pm with her cover walking in the door.

I just wanted to ask if any of you here suffers from bulimia like me? I’ve been extremely stressed with work the past few weeks and my bulimia has gotten worse. Really bad. I vomit 5-7 times a day out of stress eating. And now, my stomach is weird, I’m sick - I have runny nose and really bad sore throat. I think I’ll have a flu if this keeps up. I also barely had sleep due to work - like it’s 6:10am in Singapore and I haven’t slept yet. Worked all night and now preparing to go to work. I just don’t know how to deal with both bulimia and stress at the same time. My physical health is going downhill. I know I should stop vomiting but I can’t stop myself. I just felt bad for stress eating. I don’t know what to do. My psychiatrist and psychologist weren’t able to help me on bulimia but they were successful in helping me over depression.

 My Dad is completely against any type of psychiatric medication. He thinks people use it as a crutch or that they take medication instead of dealing with the problem/responsibility causing them to feel that way. How can I make a good argument to be allowed to take antidepressants? I am 16 so I have to have a parent consent. He basically responds to the idea of psychiatric medicine in the way that most people would to illicit drugs. What can I say to make him understand?

168,"Hey there.

My psych testing to cover possible schizophrenia is coming up (two days), and I'm starting to get nervous (more nervous than I already was, at least).  So, I figured I'd ask something, even if it's just to vent a bit.

I believe I've been in a constant state of mild dissociation for the past three years, after it came out of nowhere.  I had OCD prior to that, but it's definitely flared up (either focused on my health, since I hadn't gotten any answers, or on schizophrenia, since my therapist blindsided me with mentioning it).  I've also dealt with more of a ""normal"" anxiety (again, focused on health), as well as depression (dissociation sucks ass).

Once the OCD, anxiety and depression settled in, they've been pretty constant since everything started, and I've had no hallucinations (so far been able to identify anything that may seem like one) and no delusions (I asked my wife!).  All that being said, could it be that I'm in the prodromal phase?

Note: I've gotten pretty comfortable with my minor bit of schiz-OCD, and I'm not asking because of it.  If anything, I'm just getting freaked out over the possibilities, given my testing is about to start.",01Dec2019,1
169,"I got a nasty text from my mom on thanksgiving. We have always had a bad relationship. I have a few mental health issues. She has control and manipulation issues. She knew I was sitting down to dinner with my boyfriend’s family when I got that text so I was pissed. I didn’t respond to add fuel to the fire.
I showed up at her house the next day after she told me not to and took my sisters out shopping. We had a blast. My mom gave me an extremely pissed off look when I got there and didn’t really say anything to me the ten minutes I was at the house.
I never told my boyfriend anything, specifically the text. That would send him over the edge. He knows we don’t get along very well and she’s said negative stuff about him so he’s never been a fan. I wasn’t going to say anything and make him mad on Thanksgiving when we were with his family who I dearly love. she’s done the ignoring thing fairly frequently so I wasn’t very mad about that. 
So here’s where I messed up. My boyfriend just came over to drop off and pick something up quickly. He knew I was upset and I didn’t tell him why. i couldn’t get the words out. I don’t know why. I think it’s because I didn’t want to start crying. I didn’t want to appear weak. Also I want to just forget it and move on. But I can’t because I’m so upset. i should have told him. I don’t like sharing this kind of stuff because he doesn’t have family or mental health issues and so I have the hardest time opening up about it.
So now here I am. In a dark room. All by myself. About to cry. I messed up. I should have told him and gotten it off my chest. I messed up and now I won’t be able to sleep.",01Dec2019,1

171,"From the moment I was born until I chose to set myself free of the abuse and control I did not even have the slightest clue all the trauma my brain was trying to process and organize, I now realize I have had thoughts of suicide since I was a child to this day. I was so overwhelmed and full of denile beause of the stigma about mental illness is still so relevant in todays society, I was so afraid to admit it to myself, reach out for help, poor self awareness, the term is called smiling depression according to wikipedia. I am diagnosed with Complex-PTSD, ADHD, GAD, Major Depressive Disorder and Treatment resistant Depression.

Repetitive nightmares, freezing up when trying to talk to someone I even know, self medicating, feeling like I was in a thick fog with a blanket tightly wrapped around my brain, unable to conentrate, poor cognitive function, bad attendance at school, constantly being tired, hypervigilance, constant panic attacks I didn't even know where panic attacks, you name it I got it.
I have had multiple suicide attempts but one really gets to me and still effects me to this day psychologically. March of this year 2019 is when my pain and suffering turned into pure impulse. I swallowed 3 months worth of buspirone, wellbutrin xl, fluvoxamine and zopiclone, enough to kill 4 people at once. I remember being in my moms car and blanking out, 5 days later I wake up from a medical induced coma in ICU from being medivacted from my home town to a hospital with equipment much far advanced than my home towns hospitals equipment in an attempt to save my life. I was hooked up to so many machines I was more machine than man. All ICU doctors and emergency doctors said to my mom either ""people who take this much to attempt suicide do not live"" or ""they simply do not know how I was still alive"". I am very lucky and grateful to be given a second chance and all the support from my community at home, It is a medical phenomenon and I wanted answers I could not get.

After waking up I did not know where I was, I thought I was in a old secret catholic hospital being saved by the power of god in full delirium from seratonin syndrom and a high fever. Having a hallucination of red walls melting upwards and catholic nurses puting limbs into the wall melting down in the corners and that liquid would heal you, leading to me thinking my mom cut her leg off for me and trying to make me drink the ""poison"" which was simply just water. After a couple of days I came to reality and a few weeks of multiple testing I somehow came out uncsaved, they thought I was going to have brain damage if I lived. I know it may seem like it in the moment but ending your life is not a good alternative but I understand when your in so much pain metaphorically it seems like its the only option, TRUST ME it is not the only option! Be patient and if your in a crisis call a crisis line or 911 or text your friend(s) if you have any which I thought I didn't or family.

All of the trauma was so normal to me I thought thats what life was until I freed myself from the parasite, my father. Even if you don't think you have any struggles go see a counselor anyways and talk to them about everything and don't hide anything, it will get you nowhere, I know this from personal experience. Every individual is different and we all cope with our struggles differently so take my advice or recommendations with a grain of salt as I have no extensive education, training or licences to practice of any kind regarding this topic, find the thing that sets off that spark in you and don't give up. Keep on pushing but not to where you burn out, it is true that suicide is a permanent solution to end your pain and suffering but even though it seems like its the only option in the moment it is not, people care about you even if you aren't able to see it. ""I want to end the pain but I dont want to die"", ""I want to kill myself but I am afraid of what could be on the other side"", ""I am so tired"", there is a reason the majority of people say these things, from my perspective there is a small part of you that wants to live deep inside your unconscious.

I am now getting genetic testing to try find answers about my suicide attempt and how enough medication to kill 4 people didn't kill me, if any of you have similar experiences it would be greatly appreciated if you could share them with me or maybe throw some speculative answers at me. When you go to your GP or psychiatrist do not expect immediate response to your medication, it takes time and try not to focus solely on it, the brain is a very complex organ that humans know almost nothing about, we think we do but we do not. Medication is only part of your treatment too there are lots of things that help or do not help including therapy from a registered psychologist, counseling, practicing CBT, DBT or either or, find the best therapy and treatments for YOU. I personally found taking a break from my phone helped a lot including getting rid of all social media and don't be afraid to ask about the short term medication to get you over that hump.

Don't be ashamed if you need short term medication to get you up that rocky cliff f**k all those people who say its not a good temporary or long term solution It takes years of treatment to be able to cope again, its not as simple as a lot of people think including medical professionals. Find the simple things that put a grin on your face, it can be as simple as sitting in bed and watching your favourite show(s), cuddling with your animal(s) or pets in general, listening or reading intresting articles about the brain and the subconsciouses correlation to the conscious part of the brain on your phone or a book even about anything and simply just watching YouTube. Try to stay away from anything negative so I recommend comedy including shows like the Late Late Show ect. Find something that gives you a sense of purpose. Each doctor is different in how they treat people and be open with them and if that isn't helping find a different one that is compatible with you. If you have any questions about any more information I am more than willing and happy to answer.",01Dec2019,1

176,"I (34m) have been trying to get past a breakup for close to two years. It was by far the best relationship with anyone I have ever had. I was absolutely certain we were going to get married, which was beforehand something that was never a goal of mine. The breakup has destroyed me in almost every aspect of my life.

I used to be a very outgoing and passionate person. I would make friends everywhere I went. I loved meeting new people. I had a small circle of very close friends that I spent most of my free time with. 

When she left I didn't have a vehicle. (One of the main problems we had) Mine had been broke down and I had spent a lot of money trying to fix it (unsuccessfully). I knew it was a problem and I thought fixing my car was the least expensive and most practical solution. By the time I gave up on that and started saving to buy another vehicle it was getting close to the lease being up on our apartment and we were supposed to have been moving but saving for a car meant i couldn't afford to move. She decided to tell me she was leaving the week of my birthday and two months before the lease was up. She left a couple weeks later right around valentine's day. 

I now had to take the money I was saving for a car and use it to move to a place I could afford and that was close to work because I didn't have a car and a single income was going to make it really hard to save for one. 

Now for the breakdown. 

I had no money and no vehicle. I lost touch with my friends because I could no longer afford to go do anything. I couldn't justify spending $60 in ubering to go hang out on their couch. I felt heartbroken but also desperate to get out of the situation so I tried way too hard to pressure her into mending our relationship. I truly loved and missed her though. I still miss her. I became extremely isolated and lonely and she was living rent free, which I don't blame her I would certainly make that move if I could. She started hanging out with my friends and I felt like I was being pushed out of my life. I felt hurt and ended up cutting ties with my best friends because of it.

I felt like I had no one to turn to because my friends were hanging out with her more than me. I felt isolated. I was heartbroken, without a vehicle, struggling financially. I was depressed and tried to hang myself a few times.  Now it is two years later and the only thing that seems to have changed is I have a vehicle. 

I still miss her. I miss that relationship.  At the same time in the emotional tornado of everything. I had become (to her) to be abusive. I'm not going to say I wasn't. I tried to reach out to her constantly. Sometimes I would lash out about how she stole my friends and pushed me out of my life and how my life no longer felt worth living. I handled a lot of things badly. Not as intentional abuse. But it scared her and there was no communication between us on a mutual level so we were both just trying to infer the others intentions in our own heads. So we both created our own responses that were vastly different from the same events. Both are valid but also only half reality.  

I realize when I do toxic things like that but between the isolation and being depressed and not really having any kind of distraction it is like my brain is battling with itself and while logic wins 99% of the time, 1% percent of the time it doesn't and that's when it is visible.  

I feel stuck financially. I feel like I don't trust friends. More than not trusting relationships, I just feel disconnected from everyone. I want to make friends but being around anyone gives me a lot of anxiety now. I am afraid of inviting people to hangout because if they can't I feel even lower than I do just being alone already. I can't get her off of my mind. I dream about her and wake up having panic attacks. I miss work because I am afraid I will break down and cry somedays. I am jealous that people have other people to help them. She got to live rent free at her sister's house for two years building her credit and saving money and taking trips all over. I have plunged into being one small emergency from being homeless most of the time. I feel like there is no way for me to move forward in life without some sort of codependency situation. I can't do it on my own but I feel like the closest people in my life all turned their backs to me and I  don't feel comfortable giving any of my security to someone else. I also feel like my life has no value because without someone else it is a disaster.",01Dec2019,1
