0,My entire life I have not been able to make rational decisions. I keep doing things which feel right and the only option at the time but then have really bad consequances.  Ive wasted my entire life and other than my parents I feel like most people are going to abandon me. Ive had no family issues or any childhood trama so shoudnt be feeling this way but I am. ,05Jan2019,1

3,"I do this a lot, especially annoyed at myself for not doing things a certain way long ago.

4,"Hello,

I have been diagnosed with depression and I have been on the anti depressant sertraline for about 2 months. However, i am pretty sure i have more than depression, but i havent shared this with my doctor. 

I struggle to feel empathy or understand situations unless i am deeply emotionally involved. For example, my friend was explaining his childhood problem, and my other friend upon hearing this felt so bad and emotionally involved, whereas i didnt even blink an eye. However i knew exactly what words to use to make him feel like I had empathy and to make him feel like I understood. It sometimes feels like i can manipulate social emotions as if they are my own. I am not a sociopath- if i see someone hurt directly in front of me, or if i am properly made to understand the emotional extent of a situation then i can sympathise- other than that, absolutely nothing. 

Furthermore, I struggle to believe life is real. It’s as if i am convinced everything is a simulation or that I’m imagining what is going on, like my friends and family around my are just figments of my imagination. This affects my life negatively and it makes me struggle to take things seriously. 

I am also extremely suicidal- even tho I am on anti depressants, i dont even feel sad anymore, i just feel suicidal. I constantly think about dying, every hour of the day, i plan suicide constantly but im too LAZY to do it. And the fact that i know i most likely will pussy out in the last second due to natural human survival instincts. 

Does anyone know how i can just feel normal? Even typing all of this feels stupid because a big part of me is telling myself im wasting my time as ‘nothing is real anyway’. My ex researched into my disconnection with reality and it sounds like i have depersonalisation disorder (“Depersonalization disorder is marked by periods of feeling disconnected or detached from one's body and thoughts (depersonalization). The disorder is sometimes described as feeling like you are observing yourself from outside your body or like being in a dream.”) which makes complete sense, but i hate it so much and want to get rid of it. Anyone know how to? Or anyone have any input on if they think i might be suffering from anything else? Thanks alot",05Jan2019,1
5,"I recently started my first therapy and I’ve already grown attached to my therapist. Unfortunately, this means that I’m worried she might get bored or annoyed – which is why I have the urge to provide moments of success for her and make her feel good… I even have several ideas how that might be achieved.

Obviously, “performing” in this way is not a good idea and precisely the reason I’m in therapy. It would probably be best if I articulated those feelings to my therapist, but I’m not there yet. Whenever there is a chance of disappointing or angering her, I tread with caution. (It should be mentioned that my she is amazing and has never given me a reason to fear this reaction). 

What are your experiences with “performing” in sessions? How honest are you about your progress? How much do you hold back?",05Jan2019,1
6,"I don't ask for pity, I just need help or advice. To give you backstory, I'm a high schooler, and over the summer, I moved 1,500 miles away from my friends. I knew it would be hard, but now I feel cornered. I'm an awkward kid, so conversations with people are incredibly challenging, so in the time I've been here, I've made no new friends, and lack the mental strength to bring myself to try. This move took so much out of me, that I can't seem to do anything anymore. I've lost interest in everything I once loved, including Art which according to family I have high potential. I've lost interest in soccer and cross country, everything I once loved is fading away. I used to use art and drawing as a creative outlet to get everything in my head out, but now, I can't seem to bring myself to draw. Everytime I pick up the pencil, it hurts. Everytime I try to do anything I once loved, I feel an unbearable amount of mental pain. My parents lack the understanding and even if they didn't, I can't seem to talk to them. I feel cornered because if I try to express my feelings through drawing, I begin to hurt inside, and if I don't, it sits with me and lingers around everywhere I go. Again, I don't ask for pity, I just need help because I feel trapped in my own head and I feel like one by one, I'm loosing all attachments. I've never in my life hurt so bad. I just need advice.",05Jan2019,1
7,"Im a 17yr old male living in UK. Not entirely sure if this is the right sub. Recently been seriously considering going to the doctors about my mental health and got some questions.

The reason I haven’t already gone to doctors is because im a heavy cannabis user for my age and im worried about confidentiality due to not being 18. Been smoking alot for the last 6 months and think ive become quite reliant on the drug. Can honestly say ive been alot happier since ive started smoking regularly but recently ive been becoming more paranoid and smoking more and more. In the back of my mind i feel this cant go on forever. Feeling like im delaying the inevitable and i desperately keep pushing this thought back. Kinda thinking about stopping or at least cutting down as im becoming more concerned about my future mental health and money. I dont trust information about how bad weed is for kids mental health as its usually biased in some way.

If i was to go to the doctors what are the rules about confidentiality? Id really prefer my parents didn’t know i even went to the doctors. I know this is really not the right way to go about it bottling it up and being secretive but ive spoken to them before and its never helped and they think its there fault im not happy which makes me worse. If i were prescribed antidepressants would i need my parents permission or something? Help and advice appreciated.

9,"So I went through some kinda tuff stuff in my life and as a result it has affected me in various ways. Im constantly between feeling sad or mad and I hate that feeling and want to get better mentally. The only issue is I don't know where to start, I don't know if I'm too young to go to therapy, I'm 15 but I feel I should get these problems resolved before they haunt me in the future. Another issue I have is that I don't know if I will have the time to go to therapy. School is really hard for me and I will be dping homework from the second I get home until around 2 am. Unfortunately there are even more issues, these being that my mom doesn't take me seriously when I talk to her about how I feel and shrugs it of as teenage hormones and it leaves me feeling like theres no one I can talk to. This also results in her not really wanting me to go to therapy because she doesn't see that there's much of an issue. Lastly is a money problem. I dont have much money and I've heard that therapy is really expensive and from what I've seen it's way too much and I can't afford it. At the moment I dont know if my school offers any form of therapy or if they can refer me to a therapist that won't charge as much as others and still get a good therapist.

Thank you so much for any help and information you can give

Ps I don't know what's the difference between a therapist and a psychologist which would you say is better for someone who is in my situation?

11,"My mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia before I was born and growing up, I've learned to recognize when she'll start ""acting up"". Her latest episode was around November of 2017. Her doctor had decided to lower her medication dose, and, within a month, had divorced from my father, got him kicked out the house, and had gotten herself into financial trouble (I attended a residential school at the time, so I learned of this when I came home for Thanksgiving break). She didn't take care of herself, clean in anyway, had huge mood swings, and became very aggressive whenever I asked her if something was wrong. She often spoke to herself, laughed for no apparent reason, then cried minutes later. Luckily, her dose was returned to the original amount and she stabilized. 
Now, almost exactly a year later, she's showing some signs of another episode. She seemed completely fine, then my sister slept her for a few nights, and she became aggressive toward my father and I, laughing out of no where, then crying minutes later. 
Her symptoms alone are not problematic, but she is very important to us, financially and because she's family, so this is of great concern. We asked if she was taking her meds, she says she is, but this seems to trigger her aggressiveness. 
Any advice is appreciated.",05Jan2019,1
12,"i spent a large amount of money in one shopping trip at the mall and when i got home i had a panic attack. I’ve been trying to save my money to buy drugs. Initially I wanted to get rid of the money before I could buy more drugs, because i’m trying really hard to quit everything, but I immediately regretted it when i got home. I know i have other things to pay for but a huge bulk of my income goes to substances. i smoke, insufflate and do all sorts of things that aren’t good for me. But a part of me doesn’t want to stop. i keep jumping in between trying to quit, then failing and continuing . every time i spend money i go into this cycle of “great now i can’t get [insert drug]” and it makes me into a nervous wreck.

I’ve tripped myself downstairs, purposely slid down on my knees down a large asphalt hill, I remember being in class in 6th grade &amp; trying to cut myself with a compass protractor. I’ve attempted to give myself a black eye or fat lip as well. I even used to get excited about being hurt if it was unintentional. I was excited to be consoled.

15,"I’ve been seeing my therapist for about 3 months now and to be honest, I really have no idea if he’s a good therapist or not or if he is going to be able to help me. I’ve talked about my therapist on Reddit and also with people I know in real life and the general consensus seems to be that he’s a bad therapist. One of the biggest problems I have is that he seems to want to blame everything that happens to me on my delusional thinking. For example, I work in a very toxic work environment. On several occasions employees have quit in the middle of their shift. To me this seems like proof that it’s not just my depression making me hate my job. But my therapist won’t even listen to me when I say these things. I feel like I’m being ignored. 

I guess at this point I’m just afraid of throwing away all the progress we’ve made and of having to start over with someone new. But what do you think? When is it best to move on to a different therapist? ",05Jan2019,1
16," Iv smoked weed since I was about 13 so just over 10 years pretty much daily since day one and I know I hadn’t had a day without it in about 4 a few months ago and started drinking about the same time but only socially. Since I started working full time in my 20s and especially in the last 2 years Iv ended up drinking every night just because of the stress of work and it seemed to cut down my need for weed, my go to release. I ended up drinking 8 cans and buying 3.5g everyday I was even smoking before work. Iv always got depressed and got overly anxious about even insignificant thing, mostly work and getting in trouble drunk or making a fool of myself then worrying about whatever Iv done, what people think, what I can’t remember and ultimately why do I do this time and time again. Then this year things just seemed to blow up, I’d had a good paying job for about 4 years, a girlfriend I loved and was pretty happy with life despite my issues. Then in March my gf left me, this made me get worse but I really started questioning if I was happy with life and just developing more of a destructive mindset. This is when i started to drink more gradually from 2/3 cans to eventually 8 every week night and on the weekends a lot more but it took a few months. In this time I was living with my mum and my stepdad and sister. Then in April my parents split up, I used to call him dad. I’m going to save detail about this but in the end after he moved out and going through loads of old papers we found 2 remortgage documents, what should have been a bought house had over 80k debt on it. This just made me start to loose trust in everyone, I literally don’t trust anybody. I had a mental breakdown and ended up out of work for 6 weeks and that was one of the lowest points of my life. But somehow i managed to get back into work, I actually got a better job. I don’t know where I’d be if I didn’t. But doing that meant I had to lend 2k to get a car as I used a company car at my last job. For a while I tried my absolute best I cut back drinking a bit, tried to cut back weed but it didn’t work. I paid back the 2k. Then I just slipped back into it within a month I was back drinking and smoking loads, I started to really worry if I was good enough at my job, will I ever meet anyone, do the people I work with hate me.i can’t drink more than 2/3 without wanting more then backing out and just waking up and the stuff I was doing was getting worse. Now, December I crashed my car totalled it and the insurance wouldn’t pay out because I abandoned the car so that was recovered and I lost it. I blacked out on the works do, New Year’s Eve and most nights over Christmas. The stress has got so much worse all I do is worry, I’m dreading going back to work. I don’t even know how I’m going to get there, what If I did something stupid on the works do. Im at the point I’m lay in bed and my minds racing thinking of all eventualities, my heart speeds up and I even get the shakes sometimes. I worry about this house aswell and feel like it’s on me now I’m the only high earner, even though it could still be sold through divorce. It’s still my family’s home. But then I think Iv handled it well and get times when I think it’s all going to go to plan, like really happy but that never lasts longer than I’d say even 2 hours. So 2 nights ago Iv attempted to cold turkey weed and beer, it’s been the worst nights ever Iv not slept at all I’m wandering about then just lying down panicking with worry nearly so today I just did it. Iv got an appointment to see a doctor tomorrow at 12pm

19,"Hi everyone. Please don’t judge me, I’m here for advice.

Growing up I was the older sibling of a severely disabled brother. There is one year between us.
Throughout my childhood I 100% lived in his shadow. My family adored him whereas I was a scapegoat. Looking back, it was a very very sad childhood for me. My parents would throw birthday parties for me most birthdays but nobody ever arrived to see me, it was always for my brother. 

Even now I’m 25, my parents deny that I lived in his shadow. They totally and utterly gaslight me and my feelings and claim they loved us and treated us both the same. This is a lie. Growing up, I hated my brother with a passion because he would purposely pull stunts such as claiming I had punched him when I hadn’t, and in return my dad would beat the shit out of me without having any evidence that I had ever actually hit the disabled brother. 

Now I’m a grow woman, I’m married with a child. I began to notice at about 16, when I got my first boyfriend that I totally demanded his attention 24/7. I’ve always been insightful about my own problems and it was something I red flagged about myself. I would get angry if he went out with friends, and I’d feel really insecure/left out if he ever did something that didn’t include me. We stayed together until I was 20. As you can imagine, the break up was horribly toxic due to my controlling behaviour throughout our relationship. I struggled like crazy after he left and tried to commit suicide numerous times as I felt I had nobody. 
I hope to this day that he has found happiness.

I’ve now been in therapy for 3 years and there are minor improvements in my behaviour. I met my husband 4 years ago and we have a 1 year old now. I do not control him at all, he goes out with friends and does his own thing and I never complain, however the ugly controlling part in my brain does feel lowkey mad when he’s going out without me. I can’t tell anyone why. I’m in tears even typing this because please believe me, I am a good person. I love my husband and my child, I’m a good wife.

When my husband and I first fell in love, he was very close to his family and this made me feel as though I wasn’t good enough for him. Looking back, it was ridiculous but clearly a part of my own mental illness shining through. This is around the time I got therapy and went on medication. I still feel slightly jealous that he has such a good relationship with his siblings and parents, but my jealousy does not extend to our daughter at all. I’ve never felt any jealousy over my husbands love for her, if anything I HOPE he loves her more than he loves me.

Could these issues be related to my childhood as I received such a lack of attention? 

Thank you for any answers in advance. ",05Jan2019,1

21,"Maybe it's just human nature, but deep down I believe I am evil. I've tried to deny it but my entire life I've never felt remorse or sorry for someone else's suffering - except once. When drama occurs or  I get into an argument with someone and get them fired up I get an adrenaline rush, it makes me happy. When people are dealing with terrible things I get enjoyment out of acting like I have no empathy for them, I enjoy how they see me as the better person because I don't get all emotional and they try to be like me. I've been called heartless before, and I think it's true. I do occasionally have very intense emotional outbursts, I cry and have suicidal thoughts, but those subside quickly. I am also easily influenced but I wouldn't say any more than someone my age (I'm 16 and male). I do understand that my thoughts are bad, I understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong, but deep down I don't care. Even when I make mistakes I admit to them, and I understand in my head it was my fault and I'm willing to work to fix my mistakes. I don't have morals, I don't care when people die or suffer, however, with that being said I do feel bad for people who are trapped in bad situations because of human nature. For example, my cousin is extremely obese and suffers from a ton of health problems, he's completely reliant on his mom - my aunt. I feel bad for both of them because of their weak-mindedness my cousin can't get over his problems and my aunt can't put her foot down and refuse his requests, even to her own detriment. To be honest I do wish I felt normal emotions, and maybe I do but I'm just unhappy and I suppress them. I believe maybe I'm jealous of the happiness other people feel and I'm just bitter. I hide how I feel and I suppress it, I fake cry around people so they think I feel emotions, but I don't. I do try my best to understand and take into account other people's emotions but sometimes I just can't get the whole picture. I believe that my problems could also be a defense mechanism - I've been diagnosed with selective mutism, anxiety, and depression. I have a lot of self-image problems (no one even knows what genre of music I listen to). Do you think I've suppressed my emotions to the point of not caring about them, could I learn to feel emotions through counseling? I never get attached to people or pets now but I know in the past when one of my cats died  I cried for days (according to my mom, I don't remember it). But now my grandpa (who was nothing but great to me, he was close to me, i liked him and we did stuff together a lot, but i wouldn't consider myself ""close"" to him)is in the hospital and my cat died recently and I pretend to care for the sake of my family but I really don't.

I was dating someone at the time when this happened. her and I had a good relationship it had nothing to do with her but because of other factors in my life I felt I had no other option but to end it all..
I was sent to hospital and from hospital I was sent to a psych ward where I spent the next month and a half doped on a ton of different meds which made me feel so numb and groggy. 
Just after the stay I broke things off with the her because I didn't want to be around anyone I didn't want to be here I didn't want to be responsible for anything. I just wanted to mess up my life and my health in any possible way I could.
From that one failed attempt my life took a massive turn, they didn't let me leave the hospital and they convinced me it would be a good idea to live in a mental health recovery home for youths. They were worried about me developing psychosis /schizophrenia because of the psychotic features I was showing. so I went with them...
I completly abandoned those that I knew and because of all the meds I actually some how forgot about everything..? I knew but I didn't at the same time.. I was still the same person as I was before all this, I had confidence and was a fun person to be around.. I was hospitalized a few time after the initial ones for small things but overall I was okay..

in mid 2016 a friend and I were kicked out of the res for  excessive drug use with multiple warnings (out of all places huh)  everything went to shit from here , i was homeless for awhile until a family let me stay with them. My mental health started to get really bad and memories flooded back in of that night.
i ended up having a psychotic break or as I'd prefer to call it a spiritual psychosis which lasted over 4 months. from then on I've turned into this timid and scared person. From that episode I'm polar opposite of who I used to be I've lost myself and haven't found him yet. Not like I want all of his attributes back but I want myself back at least. The hallucinating and evil spirits took something of me and the flashes of what happened that night really hurt me. I remember her crying on the phone yelling why did I do this. All I could say in a calm voice is I'm wanting to see my (dead) uncle that's all I was saying I don't think I understood what was really happening and then I realised that it was our anniversary together that night (I would have know then but I have no memory of that month leading up to the night) 
It made me feel so extremely guilty and I really started to hate myself alot... How could anyone do all of this and not care better yet how could I forget about something as big as this?
Shit after shit kept coming at me but I was determined to get better, and to help myself out of the rut. 

2018-2019 I've been doing positive things with my life. I don't do drugs, I am studying and I am part time working as well.. but because of my low self worth I feel I am unworthy of happiness and love. I'm scared I could do the same to the new girl I'm interested in. So I back off and it hurts me but I can't stop myself from doing it. This person is super caring and a very lovely person but I keep backing away. 
I've tried so many times to learn to love myself again, to stop self destructive habits to let go of the past. Slowly I've been stopping all the bad coping habits but I just can't let go of what I did. What I put people through. 
I feel like a horrible person. I feel like the life has been sucked out of me. I can barely let people in and I want to. I want to trust, I want to love myself but it's like life is stopping me from going any further.

I just want to know if anyone has been through something similar. Any advice or If anyone can help me out on letting go or tips on moving forward.

So, I'm afraid to say Jesus Christ or God Damn stuff like that out loud AND IN MY HEAD (I know that's weird but idk lol). 
  
But the thing is, I'm not even religious. I consider myself an atheist, which makes me super confused. I think it's because my mind is always like, ""Oh, what if?"" and ""How would you explain this?"" Honestly this just makes everything 10x worse because I think I'm crazy, and I can't tell if they are intrusive thoughts or not (which I do suffer from). So I'm always doubting my religious beliefs. 

But anyway, I just now said to myself these things out loud to try and get rid of these fears. I said (((btw sorry if u are religious, nothing against that this just helped me))) Jesus Christ out loud and stuff like that. I said some kind of cringy stuff that I won't type lmao, but anyways I'm not gonna lie I was scared that my whole family was gonna die right then, and that I was gonna die right there of a blood clot or something, idk I'm still kind of scared, but I think it kind of helped. 
  
On treating intrusive thoughts I've read to not ignore them or make them go away but to acknowledge them and then don't give them attention, which I'm not really doing so this might end up making it worse idk. 

anyways just wanted to vent because my mind is very annoying and I just want to be normal lol. Does this even sound like intrusive thoughts?? I've read about something like this and my googling can't find anything.  ",05Jan2019,1

29,"Yet again. A night without sleep. At work people said I looked gaunt, I realised that I’m wearing my belt a notch tighter, and my watch moves freely up my wrist now, haven’t had to adjust the thing for about a year, yet in the Space of  2 weeks I drop. I can’t drop off. Every time I try to I’m jolted awake by a childhood memory, an unpleasant image or just genuine anger. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I’d give anything for a nights sleep. I’ve tried meditation, hypnosis, drinking, relaxation, breathing exercises, I’ve even been researching the safest sleeping pills to buy online. I feel weak, I feel alone, I feel helpless.

30,"The post was by no means a cry for help. Basically it was a “life is good. I wish I could have told myself this 3 years ago because mental health struggles are real, important, etc”. My therapist suggested that I share my story because I’m always talking about how I want to help and want to help spread awareness. So, I did. I was really pleased with it and proud of myself. It was about 2 paragraphs long and very heart felt. I received an overwhelmingly positive response. 

My not so tech savvy aunt texted me “Are you okay?” with a screen shot from a family group text where a different aunt had taken a screenshot of my post and sent it to the family with a “OH MY HELL 🙄 Read this”. 

It hurt. It hurt a lot. Honestly, said aunts were major players in my digression. When I was spiraling, it was similar shit that aided me in reaching a point where I didn’t want to live anymore. 

I’m not quite sure what the eye roll is for. Does she want to read that I tried to take my own life a year ago? That I was hospitalized and that I’m still on so many meds that I struggle to cry, even when I want to, because I’m so numb? I’m just ranting, but really don’t know where to go from here.

So few weeks ago i had parents evening and i told to my tutor about the pressure i had from  my parentz to perform well the pressure to do good from teachers and all of that. So when i had the opportunity to take extra currical activities outside class  as poetry as it helps to put on paper my feelings i took it and i went for, u may wonder what this has to do with all of this i stufy maths further maths and
Physics poetry is the way i express myself i also took an Extended project Qualification about physics as I’m really interested in astrophyisc stars and stuff like that.
Long story story short i mentioned this two (poetry and epq) to say how my teachers whom which are meant to support me just spoke to the pdincipal to stop me from doing what i love outiside class it may seems no big of a deal but i come from a muslim strict background after years and years of mental,emotional and physical abuse those things were my gate a way from this hell i really felt my heart getting shattered but really broke me was how my maths teacher sayd in front of the whole class if i was doing an Extended project and he KNEW I WAS he then said as ypur grades are going down well you not doing it anymore and there’s no reason to cry about it i had to hold my tears in the mid of the lesson then my other maths teacher said you’ve should have choosen humanities if you wanted to do poetry (just to make it clear my hobbies are physics and poetry and when i found a possibility to make my hobbies into something real i took it and they took it away from me)  so they caused me sleepless night when i spoke to my tutor i told her the pressure from my parent to achieve perfect grades was causing me to do bad (want to aknowledge not to show off but when it comes to maths its never a big of a deal i love maths). Long story short i told my tutor i hated myself im lost and when she spoke to my sister in parents evening she said you should help him at home i told my sis that i might have anxiety and depression symptoms and she said get over it people got it worse than you i really don’t know where to go spoke to gp im on a waiting list for a counsellor had sessions with my school counsellor but i just believe id be better dead off last thing to mention i always felt bi in an muslim community so imagine creating a fake straight version of myself to make my muslim parents happy also of any of you got any suicide note tip i wouls be grateful if you could gave it to me :)",05Jan2019,1

34,"*May contain triggers*

Sorry, this is my first post.

I began noticing a shift in my mood nearing close to 3 years ago. I was in my Junior year of highschool, age 16. 

I had just came back from a summer study abroad scholarship in South America and became so determined to find another way abroad. I argued relentlessly with my father about applying to go to China on another scholarship. He was paranoid, didn't trust the U.S. government to implement these scholarships, and has a need to show who is in charge. I was always angry, at everyone. That year I applied to two programs and found out later I was selected to be a Youth Ambassador in Thailand. I showed my father the acceptance email, hand shaking, and he just laughed at me. Months went by with intense arguments over letting me spend a year in Thailand. This was the first time I had ever cursed at my father, I couldn't help it. I wasn't going, final answer. We both stopped talking to eachother. All I did was lay in bed and watch TV on my phone while at his house and I eventually moved in with my mother and grandparents. 

Times worsened that summer with my mom drinking heavily and my grandpa being diagnosed with cancer. Eventually my mom moved out after fights with my grandparents and I stayed with my grandparents. I didn't drive, but had a first job at the pet store my senior year. My grandfather's condition worsened and by January he had passed while on hospice. I often felt like a failure and even more of a burden. I didn't drive and I was already 17. My motivation was shrinking while my life seemed like it was falling apart. My brother lived with my dad. My mom moved out and couldn't drive. My grandpa had just died. I had little hope for the few colleges I applied to. I soon found that I was selected to spend a gap year in China on a similar scholarship. I felt numb. I wasn't happy. I couldn't wait to leave.

China was great, but my happiness was sometimes few and far between. I felt detached from events, people and life. I began dissociating from my surroundings and experiencing mood swings. I was irritable the day I visited the Great Wall of China. I was actually quite miserable and I still kick myself for being such an ass that day. When I was in China I convinced myself my hair was thinning and bought spirunila tablets to correct it. I also convinced myself I had diabetes because my limbs were tingly and I wanted to sleep after eating- especially foods high in sugars. I find that I was especially paranoid with my own health as well as how other people viewed me while in China and often worried my host family hated me despite all the nice things they bought for me and the places they took me. I felt like a burden - no different from most of my life. 

Now I just finished my first semester in college. I began to feel suicidal weeks after I began school. I wanted cars to hit me. I imagined hurting myself. I had nightmares about hurting myself. I felt empty. Numb. So numb. I could feel happiness when I was with people who had good humor, but as soon as they were gone the emptiness resumed. Oddly, I decided I would learn Romanian in secret so I could disappear after graduation and no one would have a clue where I would be. I later began to worry I had Autism. I began searches on the internet and found that visual thinking is a sign of Autism. My mom told me she thought I was Autistic when I was a kid. It didnt seem far fetched to me. I read books and watched Atypical. I began acting and speaking differently. I didn't know why. I later had a stutter, perhaps a stammer, in my speech for no reason. 

Amidst all this I was seeing a counselor at school and one week I had an especially terrible text-message conversation with my mom and I blocked her. I decided to take a walk to clear my mind. I almost jumped off a bridge that day. I got up to the side and peered over. I saw my self smacking the ground and head cracking. It felt good to imagine. I didnt jump, but when I told my counselor days later what had happened, I  was escorted by school police to a psychiatric hospital where I voluntarily signed myself in.  

A few weeks after being discharged from inpatient I convinced myself I was bipolar. I didn't sleep for two days. I got my first ear piercing and almost bought concert tickets to visit a friend across the country. I put myself into a manic episode. I am not bipolar. I had a smaller self induced manic episode more recently (think past 2 weeks). I am not sure how I did this. I have since self harmed only twice. One therapiat says anxiety and depression. Another seems to suspect a possibility of BPD. I am not sure what to think. Why do I mimic symptomology? Am I just a Hypochondriac? Does anyone else convince themselves there is something wrong with them, and then changes their behavior because of it?

35,"Recently I have hit a crossroads in my life. Recently graduated from college and struggling to even want to find a job.

If its my fault I will take the blame but I need help to get over this.  Something is just draining my soul. I have so many doubts. I am high right now and I've written so many things down for myself to read when I am sober but I never do.  If I post on Reddit I will have to look at it because I spend a great deal of time here. I cant answer hard questions and cant take hard truths. When I am sober though its like I have a mental block and this ability to ask for help isn't there.

37,"Back in high school I was struggling with anxiety. I couldn't be in class because of the fear of speaking or being looked at, so I would skip a few every day and hide in the bathroom (one day I skipped a whole day of classes). I couldn't focus if I was put in the front of the classroom. I'd be doing something else like fake writing on my paper and not listening. My anxiety started since freshman year and has gotten worse. So this led to depression and I barely had the motivation to do *anything*. Now I'm at a community college that I don't even want to be in.

But let me share one event that I still think about. 

One morning on a Friday my mom was yelling at me on the ride to school about how depression shouldn't keep you from doing your work and blah blah blah. I was so furious and angry at school that I started crying as soon as I entered class first period. I put my head down and blocked everyone out. So much that my dad had to come. He yelled my name and I still was there like a little child having a tantrum. He grabbed my arm and then i yelled GET OFF OF ME and I went to the floor crying like a baby. Then all of a sudden I ran out the room and left the school without my belongings. I just ran outside and stood behind a tree. Thinking about my life and what I just did. Then I decided to run away. I took the bus all the way to its last stop and walked afterwards. I was just thinking and thinking how it's so much peaceful just walking by myself no parents after me. Then I walked myself to the hospital hoping to just stay there for the rest of my life but I was 17 at the time so I had to return back to my parents.

And this was not the only time I ran away.

But for the life of me I still can’t understand what’s going on with my mind.

I just cannot think or concentrate clearly, I’m highly reactive to whatever environment, either too dull or too sharp...too high, too low..

my vision is even messed up like I have some visual processing issue.

I wake up either with my head on fire and like I haven’t slept, or I sleep a copious amount and feel heavy and tired.

I have brief moments of recovery or mental health and the rest is a landslide.

43,"Today I thought about killing myself. For the past few days, to be honest, I've thought about taking a razor and slitting my wrist or maybe walking to the bridge by my apartment and jumping off of it because it would be fast. I recently flunked out of my second degree and I'm ashamed of it. I had a lot of people in my life building me up to be successful and now I'm struggling with money, wanting to drink to numb my emotions, and hiding in my apartment because I'm too afraid that the people I love will get a hint of how far I've fallen off the horse. I have the means to commit suicide so that makes me high risk.

I'm not going to kill myself today.

Instead, I'm going to give you the reasons why I'm going to stay in this life.

Reason 1: 
I go to sleep next to a man who loves me every single night. He is my asshole boyfriend who doesn't do his dishes, pisses me off when he tells me my breath is bad, and he spends too much money on his car. We've been together for two years and every night he falls asleep holding me while I quietly wait for it to be safe to pull myself off of his sweaty body and roll over to my side of the bed. Our relationship is a beautiful mess. The first reason I am choosing to stay alive is that I am sleeping next to the man that I am going to marry. I think he knows it too. I am choosing to stay because I have the capacity to love when it isn't easy. I have the capacity to love myself today.

Reason 2:
One piece at a time, I can pick up the pieces of my life. I work a kitchen job on weekends. I get up, drive 20 minutes, chop some vegetables, wash some dishes, and go home with aching feet. But I also smile while I'm there. I don't feel like a cog in a machine. I feel like I'm part of a team. While I'm there, I'm doing things that make it possible for a group of people to do something that is greater than myself. I am capable of taking small steps forward because I know that small steps are part of a larger journey. The second reason I will live is because I have the capacity to build joy from small pieces of smiles.

Reason 3:
I have things to look forward to. I'm going to be a researcher and I'm going to be damn good at it. In my short time in this life so far, I have had the opportunity to experience the best feeling in the entire world: the feeling of discovery. After months of collecting data, reading papers, and running statistics, I have had lived the thrill of learning something that nobody else in the entire world knew. Of all the tears I have cried, nothing has ever been more powerful than those tears of happiness that seeped out of me in that moment. With a joy like that burning a fire in my heart, I have the capacity to change the world. The third reason I will stay in this life is that this world will be better because I did.",05Jan2019,1

46,"This is something I think I first noticed in elementary school maybe? But it became a lot worse when I got into high school. 


I can get obsessed with a man or a woman, even though I am not attracted to women. 


I can go months or longer without caring about dating or relationships. Being single doesn't bother me at all- until I get a crush on some guy. Then, for whatever reason, I become very obsessed with him. Stalk his social media accounts constantly, ""accidentally"" end up at places that he is going, think about him all day everyday. It consumes me and almost gives me a kind of high. I think I usually end up creeping the guy out, which just makes me more obsessed. And then I think ""I'm nothing without him, there is no point of living if I can't have him."" Even though, most of the time, we've never freaking dated, and it's just a random guy I started liking a few months prior. There were times I thought about suicide constantly because of some dude I barely even talked to. I'm not sure if the ""obsessed"" person  I act like is actually me though. It's just so weird how I can go from not wanting a relationship at all to straight up obsession. 


My obsession when it comes to girls is not romantic though. I just become extremely jealous of them. And I wish to be them or to be like them. I stalk their social media too and just think of how ""wonderful"" my life would be if I could just be her. Sometimes I have an urge to become their friend or best friend. I have imagined myself as someone else many times. I have created girls I was jealous of in the Sims and other games so I could ""be them.""


I don't know why I'm like this. I'm very ashamed of these behaviors and thoughts, but I can't stop doing those things. I am not sure if this is a mental health issue. Or if this is somewhat normal, but I highly doubt that it is. I have never told anyone that I do and think these things because I feel that it is very strange and embarrassing. ",05Jan2019,1

48,"     I’ve had horrible self confidence issues since a young age. My father was a alcoholic and a schizophrenic. My mother has issues herself, including not protecting me from abuse, engaging in enabling of my father and emotional incest. I hit the proverbial lottery, and didn’t acquire any mental illnesses, aside from very low self confidence. Low self confidence has always dominated my life. Never feeling good enough, always being scared of the future and feeling unloveable. I’ve passed up opportunities because of my anxiety and low self confidence. 
     Now it is causing a chasm between myself and my family(fiancé). A conversation occurred before work tonight where she asked me to help more with the costs of the wedding, it was a reasonable request. I had a reaction, because of my insecurity of her making more than me, and feeling emasculated. I said something to the effect of” I feel like I’m always being bossed around”. Feeling horrible, I apologized after, and she unleashed a triad. My fiancé has told me she is sick of my “pity parties”, “sob stories” and how they relate to my insecurities (looks, money, abilities,job..etc). However, she did express that she loves me and money doesn’t matter. I’m afraid I’m going to push her away and she will leave because of how I feel, even though she has said otherwise. Expressing how I feel has led to more ridicule, because she thinks I’m more than capable and successful. She also struggles with depression, but refuses to see a therapist for it.

50,"Ive read as much as I can on the disorder and I know it's not really a huge deal but I am bothered by this for a few reasons. First I'd like to say that I disagree with the diagnosis. I had a stillborn son, a close friend die, and my last living uncle passed away all on top of my boyfriend of 9 years dumping me over the phone and a relapse into alcoholism (3 months sober again now) over the summer. I had a really terrible string of events all at once and she diagnosed me with adjustment disorder in October, which was a month after the relationship ended and the last death occurred. I was pretty understandably worn out, depressed, and shell-shocked at that point. I wasnt even particularly emotional that day in her office so I'm clueless as to where she got the idea that I wasn't coping well enough.

I dont as much mind the diagnosis, despite the fact that I think it's incorrect, as the fact that she didn't take the time to explain it to me or even mention it  before adding it to my medical record. Admittedly, I don't like change much and can have anxiety surrounding newness, but when it comes to traumatic life events I think I bounce back as well as anyone else. Is it normal for a doc to do that? I've never had it happen before and it seems pretty unethical to formally diagnose someone with a disorder without their knowledge. Idk why that bugged me so much, as I know adjustment disorder is more of a situational diagnosis as opposed to a chronic one like bpd, but it does.",05Jan2019,1
51,"I don't get along with my family and they only talk to me when they want something. Other than that I am quite literally ignored and not afforded much common courtesy.

The only talk they want to speak with me is when they want me to drive them somewhere. 

My sister brings her boyfriend over nearly every night and my room is right next to hers. I work all night til 2 am and then I come home. After a shower, dinner and some tv I get to be about 4:30 or 5 am and then I like to sleep til 11:30 or 12. My sister and her boyfriend speak loudly and make noises when they get up and they wake me up all the time. I have spoken to my sister about this several times and she basically raises her voice and gets aggravated so that my parents intervene and tell me to shut up. I haven't been able to speak to her boyfriend lately because they have been away for a few days, but I had a huge argument with my mum a few days ago about it and when I said I only had two hours sleep, a he called me a weak person and told me to move out.

I don't bother anyone else, I go to gym and read books or play video games until I go to work. I buy food and pay all my own personal expenses and also pay for the internet connection.

I've tried to discuss this with them many times but after all the arguments and words said it just feels hopeless now.

I want to save up more lonely before I move out, but does anyone have any coping tips in the short term? I've tried getting to do things with My brother before but he won't even say hi to me. No how was work, no what are you up to, nothing. Only when he wants me to drive him to the night club, that's when he will speak to me. 

Any tips on coping and not giving in? My dad has a habit of ignoring me until my brother or sister want something, and they know I will say no, so he sweet talks me into doing it because I don't like saying no to my parents. Then he goes back to ignoring me like a nobody again.

Any advice please guys? Sorry to go on about it. Just want to get it out to someone, been feeling like crap lately. I told my mom I am just asking for you to speak to your daughter and you care more about her and her boyfriend than your own son. And she said ""tough, move out"". They never say that to the other two, only me.",05Jan2019,1

Hey guys,neuro surgeon has diagonesd me for somatic disorder. It all started when I took benzos for 15 days and after a while I took Gabapentin 300 mg for 3 days. 
I am 100% sure that these medicines caused me many side effects. 
Like fatigueness, tremors, Twitching,head pressure , tinnitus , anxiety and many other . 

But doctor think that it is impossible for me to have side effects in such short duration . Doctor has again prescribed me some ssri which I refuse to take. No one believe me right now. Day by day I am getting more depressed. I have no history or panic disorder in the past. My mind cannot function as it use to do. I can see my career slipping away in front of my eyes while my friends are getting established.
Does anyone else have somatic disorder and feels that they are misdiagnosis??

53,"Over the years I've read countless articles, books and threads about depression and mental illness, trying to understand it, and I accepted that what I feel is just depression, and I wanted to believe what others tell me, but I can't really take over someone else's subjective experience of life. I'm not living their life and they're not living mine.

When I talk to a therapist, or someone else, of course I feel pressured to force myself to feel like I ought to want to live. They think that how I really feel is not rational, and I don't like to push my opinions down someone's throat or make them keep uncomfortable, so I just go quiet and play along. I can't flip a switch and feel different.

I'm just trying to play along so others aren't uncomfortable. But I wish I wouldn't have to. I wonder if I am stupid for disregarding my own feelings and experiences in favour of people who say that suicide is dumb or that it gets better. Saying something, doing something, even thinking something, it's all so much easier than changing how you truly feel. All that I truly feel is that I don't want this life. No matter how many therapy sessions, if someone doesn't like the color blue, you can't make that person like the color blue. You can only make them tolerate it, or pretend to like it. It doesn't matter what they really feel. I'm taking medication and I think I handle life pretty well, but I can't brainwash myself into wanting to live. I just don't.

I will not be mixing anything unless my doctor prescribes me, but would like to give him a suggestion, I can ask him but could be waiting months for a decision if he decides to contact mental health professionals, and I'd like to be able to give suggestions rather than shrugging my shoulders when he asks me what we should do.

I desperately wanted her to tell me i was depressed, because i wanted to have a word and a solution for what was wrong with me. I always felt unstable. My psychologist told me i was going through a normal phase in puberty since everything was changing around me. At that time i also told my mom i thought i had bpd because ive been researching it a lot, but she didnt believe me. Since then i havent told anyone about this.
I'm 16 now and i'm so fed up with my constant mood swings and instability that i finally went to get help. I made an appointment with a psychologist and psychiatrist but thats in 3 months. Again, im desperate for a medical professional to tell me that somethings wrong with me and how i think and that we're finally going to work on how to fix me. I dont want to feel like this anymore. How i feel has never influenced my life as much as now. Im closed down, irritable, unhappy, anxious. Some parts of the day i can be happy and have hope, but i never know when that will come crashing down. I started cutting again and have suicidal thoughts.

58,"This may be a long post so bare with me.

I'm a 27-year-old male who hasn't had a steady job for my entire life. I've had some pretty bad Anxiety/Depression since Highschool which led me to drop out in grade 10. I don't think I'm stupid, but dropping out was a dumb thing to do. I just couldn't handle the day to day of school. As I got older I've tried to go to Adult Ed &amp; to work countless jobs with no avail. I think the longest I've kept a job has been 3 months.

I finally decided 2 years ago that I would try to get my life back on track and try and fight this, I was on a waitlist for a Psychiatrist for over a year who was not helpful at all. He did see that I had really bad Anxiety and I thought he wanted to help, but he cancelled a bunch of appointments on me then just never rescheduled. He also forgot most things I told him from week to week which really sucked.

About 6 months ago I finally started trying to get out and find work again. I got a job I have been trying to get for a while which is Reffing for a ball hockey league. I figured it would be perfect for me cause I know the place well &amp; I can make pick my own days, but it has been really tough to even keep something I wanted to do for so long and it's very discouraging. Around this time I've also been seeing my doctor who has prescribed me some different meds ranging from Anxiety,Deperssion, Sleep &amp; ADHD pills with none of them helping in the slightest.

I know I have to be patient when it comes to pills and nothings gonna change overnight, but if I can't even hold a job that is only a couple of hours a month that I wanted to do, how am I suppose to live? No money, living in my dad's apartment, it pisses me off that I need to rely on him and that bothers me the most.

In closing, I don't want to live like this anymore, but I feel trapped with no way out.

60,"Rewind 5 years, the education system worked perfectly for me. I was a successful student that had just finished high school with some awesome results. 

At age 21 (now) I’ve recently been diagnosed with Cyclothymia, alongside existing anxiety &amp; depression. The combination of these new symptoms over the last 5 years has meant I’ve enrolled into numerous courses and been unable to complete them. I’ve had tonnes of somewhat helpful (but exhausting and vague/short) therapy and tried 10 different types of medication (complete with all sorts of dreadful side effects). Plus experienced numerous abysmal and traumatic events, which I think I’m doing bloody well at dealing with. 

After seeing a psychiatrist for the first time, I’m being offered more therapy suited to dealing with my existing issues, and I’m finally making the decision to put my career/education on hold. Although scary, I think this has been a long time coming. As mentioned, there’s stuff happening in my life alongside this that are draining and I don’t think I’ve given myself healing time. 

Most of me knows this is the right thing to do, but part of me feels like I’ve wasted my hard work on the current course I’m doing.  I have gained lots of practical knowledge, made some awesome friends and gained two years work experience in my field, just means I won’t have the bit of paper in 6 months time saying I finished the course.

62,"Hi everyone.

I just want to hear your opinion on something I've been dealing with for a long time now. Many years, actually.

When I was in high school (around 6 years ago) I started dealing with random anxiety attacks in that I would fixate on a stressing thought for days to the point where I'd even experience a panic attack. That led me to visit a therapist during the last year of high school.

The therapist confirmed that I had some form of anxiety, probably an anxiety disorder, but he was never very clear about it. I went a few times and then stopped because I found him mediocre.

For these past 3 years or so, I don't deal with panic attacks but I have a different form of the issue I described. I basically overanalyse things, almost all day. In most cases, they are things that I might feel uncomfortable about thinking. Not necessarily taboo or offensive. Just a tad bit inappropriate. And the thing is that If I avoid the overanalysation I start feeling stressed. As if I haven't completed something important. As if I have to do it, otherwise my day won't be right. It certainly isn't tremendous stress but it is annoying.

Do you have any idea what could be causing this? Is there a name for it? Is it something specific? I can't afford to go to a therapist in the meantime so I guess just having a possibly clearer picture of what I might be having would make feel a bit better.

Thanks in advance.",05Jan2019,1

66,"For the last few weeks I've been thinking about something I noticed a couple of years ago when I traveled the world.

In  this trip, it surprised me that a lot of people were traveling  alone.  But also, my psychology training told me that the ones who used social  media all the time showed symptoms of depression. But it turned out that  it wasn't just about people who were traveling alone, but also  people  on groups.

I know, there are several  studies that link depression with the use  of social media, but I knew  there was something bigger than that.

I believe social media platforms are tweaking our perception of reality and shaping our identities without we even notice it.

68,"A few minutes ago, I felt like I was losing my mind. I laid in my bed, watching YouTube, falling asleep to a woman explain what's wrong with the movie adaptation of The Hobbit. For some reason I woke up at about 4 in the morning. The first thing that hits me is ""oh fuck somethings here, ITs here or an extension of IT."" I didn't move, I don't even think I opened my eyes, but I see it. The ""creature"" looking me in the face laughing. My stomach twisted up and my heart fell. I thought that if I just stayed still, pretend not to see it and went to asleep, it wouldn't bother me. As I tried to fall asleep, I felt something wrap around me. It's not gentle at all, it hurts. When I try to move my arms it's like a thick rope from neck to my thighs is constricting me. I could still move my hands and my legs, but my arms were tied to my chest. I've experienced sleep paralysis before, but then I couldn't move at all. I decided to open my eyes thinking that if I saw it and recognized it wasn't real it would go away. I looked at it still laughing in my face, I can't even describe how I felt. I could hear my heat beating in my ears. It went faster and faster to the point that I knew it wasn't my heat, but some loud noise I didn't recognize. I was so frightened. Out of all the things I sometimes ""see"" this was the first time it felt like I couldn't logic my way out or ignore it. It felt too real. I went for my phone (hoping that maybe I could call my mother who was on the couch sleeping). Then like a switch the noise was gone. I could still feel the thing there in the room with me, but my arms were free.
I'm fully aware that what happened isnt normal. There was a time, deep in my depression, that I thought that I needed to commit suicide in order to get to my ""special"" heaven. My special heaven was just a place I dreamed of often. The entrance is through the forest in my backyard. I spent a better part of a year coming up with reasons to off myself. ""You only have so much time"", ""the world you think is reality is dying"", ""if you wait too long IT will get you"", or ""your dog is a demon and your father is a mind reader!"" Dumb shit I can look back on now and realize,with a sound mind, is crazy. Lately things like that don't seem so far fetched. I'm getting more paranoid. I don't think my father can read my mind (most of the time), but I'll get a  random voice in my head ""watch out your mother poisoned the food"", and ""if you don't do blank then ITs going kill you."" I fall back on old conspiracies. I don't think this way or expirence this stuff all the time. The last time I ever got this paranoid was in the 8th grade. It's the main reason I decide to ignore the things I ""see"" or the random paranoid thoughts. I feel assured that I'm not like that anymore and can quickly shoot down that stuff. You know logic it out. ""Your dad can't read your mind. If he could he would react to it or make decisions based off your knowledge unless he happens to be a good actor, which he is not. You're fine."" ""No. Your mom is not trying to poison the family. She's tasting the soup right in front of you."" ""Stop looking at the shadow thing or the other thing out the window. That isn't real, IT isn't real, and you need to calm down before you scare yourself.""
My only mental health problem for the last three years has been my depression. It's already been discussed with my family and I'm meds for it. Even now I know that what happened was just my paranoia running a muck. I see that, I accept it, but I'm still upset about it. I want to assume I'm just exaggerating and just ignore it.

When I was depressed I'd spend all of the time after work pretty much doing nothing. Just refreshing reddit/youtube, locked to the screen all day, slouching, tired, declining every opportunity to go out and meet people. I also binge eat like crazy when I'm in that 'zone'. Anything sweet in my house is gone in one evening.

I went home for holidays and my schedule was packed. Meeting friends/family every day, from morning till night, always hanging out with someone and I felt fantastic. Good eating habits, I was happy and sociable. I'm usually pretty introverted and have low social skills but I was on top of my game and confidence.

The first day I came back from home I smoked some weed and went straight back to that 'zone'. Every time I smoke by myself I get there. I start thinking about things, getting paranoid, thinking noone takes me seriously, etc.

75,"Hello, this is my first visit here. I feel a bit selfish and uncomfortable dropping this wall of text with my issues just like that and expecting support but anyway, I'd sincerely greatly appreciate if someone tried to understand me.

I'm in my mid 20s. I believe I had a decent childhood, I was pretty sensitive but I could live with it, in some ways it was an advantage and I was doing great. Since my teen years, I've been becoming increasingly more avoidant, emotionally numb, anxious and depressed. I couldn't be myself around people, I'd pretty much instantly freeze up and no one could ever reach me, I grew very distant and lonely though I never admitted it to myself and anyone, I pretended that it was my choice and there wasn't much wrong with it. Even though I still had some sense of direction in life left, I feel that I would often act against my own will and make odd decisions that I couldn't explain. I would avoid most things, I couldn't commit to doing anything, it's as if at some point I would start sabotaging myself, quit everything and turn to escapism even further. Every activity felt forced, my whole life has become a tiresome habit, I lost most of my awareness, my goals and dreams disappeared, I constantly needed distractions. It all became a blur, I lost track of my thoughts and emotions, it was a state of extreme confusion and frustration. I somewhat saw myself from the outside, I knew I became the opposite of myself yet in some ways I still denied it all. Tackling every issue one by one, like addiction or inability to connect with people wouldn't work at all as I couldn't get to the root cause, I wouldn't open up even to myself. I couldn't feel much anymore, even the negative feelings went somewhere deep so I became completely lifeless and apathetic, there wasn't even enough pain that would push me to change.

After a decade or so, I finally got to the answer why most of this is happening. It was the psychological abuse I experienced at the age of around 11. I haven't entirely suppressed these memories, I just pretended it was all insignificant. Admitting that the abuse affected me would have made me feel weak so I never did, even to myself. It wasn't particularly extreme in most people's eyes, most less sensitive people would've likely mostly shrugged it off (or rather didn't let it happen in the first place) so I convinced myself it couldn't have been a big deal, even though somewhere deep down I always knew it. I felt what's done is done, there was no point in going back anyway. 

I would get shamed and attacked for my emotions, self expression and achievements. I couldn't get away from it, so I had to adapt and change myself. I completely detached from myself and became someone different and buried my old self somewhere deep inside. I have a very strong aversion to showing any emotions. Something like laughing or seeming happy makes me feel very ashamed and uncomfortable and I just  can't do it, a part of me is resisting, yet I also feel awful that I can't do it. My life is almost completely controlled by subconscious fears. As I look into myself deeper I find that I am very constrained in every way, unconsciously, every little body movement or a word said or a look has to be done in a certain way, there is a complete lack of freedom. I'm just not here, I'm like a spectator looking through someone's eyes, most of actions are barely conscious. I recently dug back up some of my goals and dreams but there are so many invisible mental barriers I still don't understand and they keep me from doing anything at all and moving forward in life, I'm completely frozen. I recently had this very brief, unexpected experience in my mind where I strongly felt completely free, like my true self and I can now understand the immense contrast, it also gave me hope that I can actually someday attain this state of mind.

I signed up for professional help and so far the first therapist seemed somewhat understanding and helpful, but they don't seem competent enough to deal with my situation despite having some credentials and I don't have much options, though I'll try to do everything I can to seek someone who could help. I have to work on it a lot myself too. I'm somewhat familiar with some trauma healing techniques but I'm so emotionally withdrawn that I can't really get into it, accessing memories also seem almost impossible. 

Even though I am more aware of my situation than ever, strongly want to heal, and get occasional bursts of inspiring emotions, I'm still facing a lot of internal resistance. I still spend most of my time distracting myself. It's as if I occasionally slip out of this coma but then I shut myself down again. Like I've been typing all this the whole day on and off, I was really into it for some time, I got emotional a couple of times and now as I'm wrapping this up, I feel very drained and tired and needing to get away, distract myself and just waste time. Forcing something uncomfortable so you no longer fear it or building habits doesn't seem to work in my current state. I'm starting to understand the importance of emotions so I feel this is what I should focus on but I don't see how. These little exercises for example like noting throughout the day how you feel seem really tiresome and annoying no matter what, it feels like I don't really recognise the emotions and I end up making things up.

Not that I don\`t find enjoyment in them at all, just that I don\`t get maximum enjoyment out of them. There\`s this YouTube channel I watch and it\`s basically my happy place but now when I watch it I laugh now and then, but mostly I\`m feeling nothing. This is pretty much the same with everything I enjoy doing. For some reason I used to start having thoughts about depression or suicide usually late in the day then the next day I\`d feel better, but now I just feel like this pretty much all the fucking time. I told my mother to try and help me but it was no point because my parents are a bunch of fucking useless cunts that don\`t have any fucking good advice. I told my mother that I want to see a counsellor and she got angry with me and told me that a counsellors advice is gonna be the same as hers. After that I feel like I can\`t trust my family, or anyone for that matter. I even considering just deciding to accept living like this. I just want these fucking feelings to go away right now. Right fucking now. ",05Jan2019,1
80,"In my early teens and a little depressed but not here to talk about that. Don't know when this started, but essentially a person or an animal can get me pissed off really easily and (not entirely sure what triggers me) I yell, curse, and always threaten the person wether it's with a first in their face, or verbally. when it's an animal I go really hands on and man handle it. I don't know why I do this, and that pisses me off even more because I generally love animals and love to talk to people. And I get depressed when I later calm down because I scream at myself that I'm mentally fucked or something. Anyways an example of me getting angry was when I was at school with a group of  friends. We were playing tag or something (because high school can be elementary School if we want it to be) and I got real pissed of at my friend for saying something I don't remember and I arm bared him to the ground and pulled his arm to drag him. uuugh it makes me shiver to think how fucked up that was because when he came up to me and asked why I did that, my response was to say I don't know, and run away to almost cry in the hallway. When playing with my dog he'll get riled up and play this run in circles and nip game and it pisses me off that I have to use actual effort to catch him cause he's very fast and agile. When I have him I don't hurt him, would never think about doing that. I just trip him to the ground softly, he's so excited he doesn't care, and he'll keep nipping. So I put my hand on his face to keep his mouth away while my other hand is on his body holding him on the ground. I just wonder if I'm not abusive by doing this? I feel I am and it makes me feel like a bag of shit. Tons of other example of this even with family members (whom I'm a little more violent with) I could go on and on about but I'm not going to. Just wondering if this is serious (because I know it's freaky and weird) and something I should get help with.",05Jan2019,1
81,"So, quite a few years back, when I moved to Canada, I stopped speaking my mother tongue and switched completely to English hoping that this will help me with my mental well being and it’s been working out great. I have painful memories associated with my native tongue, I have been groped by people who speak it and almost raped, also, I never felt like I belong in my country of birth because people there made me feel different on the basis of my skin colour (I’m white). I’m a much happier person right now than I was when I spoke my native lang. please don’t tell me your native language is part of you and your heritage, because that’s not enough of a reason to retain it in such a situation and my ancestors didn’t speak my native language, they came from somewhere else with a different culture and different everything.",05Jan2019,1

I am generally locked into my bedroom lying in bed 3 or 4 times a week. I dont go outside for days on end. I never ""feel"" like hanging out with my friends-it just seems like so much work. I dont eat enough and I'm lucky If i drink half a glass of water in a day. I have no hobbies because I feel no enjoyment when I do them. Actually I dont really feel ""enjoyment"" in general, unless it something extreme. I cant get sexually aroused by others. I cant really connect with others. Sometimes I just feel like crying for no reason (and there are my mornings and night lately where I just sob). My parent get angry at me for being locked in my room all the time, but their presence, alone, irrtates me. Hearing them speak irritates me half the time. I get snappy around them.

I'm a student. I still manage to motivate myself to do well in classes, but I starve myself studying for exams, 6 hours straight. I get so focused that I can't take care of myself. In class, I can't pay attention. Everything goes in one ear and out the other. I cant see before exams, and in general, I'm lucky If I only wake up twice or three times in a night.

85,"I'm kind of new to reddit. So I'm not sure is this is the right place or not. But I'm just so startled and I dont know what to do.

So heres a little background. My family has currently moved quite aways to a new home with new possibilities. (New year, new home.) But like I said it's quite far from our old home so we have to go on weekends to our old home to finish bringing the rest of things over to our new home. The older and stronger ones go with my parents while the younger ones stay. Now I'm one of the older siblings so theres no doubt I'm expected to go along with my parents to help move. But last time I went, we stayed at the old house for 3 days moving everything. And I had the worst mental and physical experience ever. On the drive there I have no idea what happened. But pretty much, I forgot my own identity. My mind was in a fog so bad and my head was aching. I only had 4 hrs of sleep. Memories were dashing back and forth. My body was screaming and my head felt like it was on fire. When I finally got back, it took me the entire week to finally feel ""normal"" again. 

So here I am again. My parents are going back down and they expect me to come with them. But I became so afraid. I didnt want to repeat the same events as last time. And I felt that going back would trigger me to remember some pretty heavy memories. I was afraid of what would happen to my mental health again. 
But it didnt matter. My dad didnt care and he wanted me to come. So at the last moment I pushed everything onto my sister and convinced my parents to bring her and not me. And for some reason they agreed. My sister began yelling and complaining about how she didnt want to go. But my dad didnt care. Everyone was yelling and screaming and my sister was so mad at me. She was yelling at me and she didnt even want to look at me. What I did was so unlike me! Normally I'd apologize and go with my parents. But I froze and all I could do was curl up into a ball and hide. I couldnt even look at her. I didnt even say a word to her. I hid in the corner of the room as everyone left and I didnt even say goodbye. I was afraid of everyone. I feel so guilty. She's my best friend and I threw her under the bus. I'm so disappointed in myself. I think the guilt is going to kill me before the fear does. ",05Jan2019,1
86,"I feel like I'm drowning on the inside, with goods days and bad days. My doctor just puts me on anti-anxiety pills because I also stress over everything (I'm a uni freshman and very Type-A over grades). The pills aren't working

Beyond anxiety, I feel like I'm borderline crazy- for lack of a better word. I'm a burden on everyone and sometimes I wish I didn't exist. I used to joke and say that I self-sabotage everything good in my life but now I feel like it's true.

Some days I feel like my 'usual' self- bubbly, outgoing, jokey, etc. and then other days it feels like a switch has went off in my head and I feel emotionally numb and cold. I lash out at people who love me and i say very hurtful things and honestly, I don't feel bad when I say them even though I'm aware that I SHOULD feel bad.

For eg, occasionally me and my boyfriend fight and I say terrible things. Afterwards he asks me to put myself in his shoes to understand how it feels, but I can't. I KNOW what I say is hurtful but I just don't care. I hate how I don't care. I dont want to hurt the people I love but I do it over and over again, like I can't stop myself. My past two boyfriends have also been subject to my lashing out episodes and I have no idea why they stayed with me as long as they did. Maybe it's because when I'm normal, I'm very loving and warm. But then some days I basically 180 personality-wise and become the bitch from hell.

In addition to this, I feel like my close friends don't know who I really am. Everyone I interact with, I put on a fake personality and alter it depending on what they're like. I find I have trouble making friendships (that progress beyond being acquaintances) because I can't be myself around anyone. I'm always trying to be a crowd pleaser. Sometimes I wonder if I even know who I am.

I really want to see a psychiatrist because I don't think the way I act is normal, but maybe I actually am normal and just a cold person. I don't know.",05Jan2019,1

90,"I’ve been taking Wellbutrin HCL for a few months now. I’m prescribed 150 mg two times a day. Recently my boyfriend alluded to the fact that I’ve been much angrier lately and blames me being on medication, so I have been considering getting off of it altogether. It sucks because Wellbutrin is the ONLY thing that has ever worked for my severe depression, but I feel that it’s important for me to stop because I can’t stand the idea of me being an angry person.

I’ve been very sick the past few days and have only been able to take my morning dose. I have yet to feel any side effects from cutting my dose in half, but is this a safe thing to do? I’ve heard mixed reviews on cutting your dose, and it sounds like it all depends on the type of Wellbutrin you take. I’m just not sure if I’m going about this the right way or not? I’m seeing my doctor in a couple of weeks, but me getting off meds can’t wait any longer if it’s going to make me easily agitated and hard to deal with.

Anyway, I got a smartwatch for christmas. And said smartwatch apparently can track my sleep and tell me how much time I spend in the different phases (REM, deep sleep, etc.). It's been recording my sleep for almost 2 weeks now and when I went to check the stats (just because I was curious), it said I spend almost 0 minutes in deep sleep. Maximum I got was 20 minutes during a 10 hour sleep. How accurate are these things? And is it normal if I actually rarely spend time in the deep sleep phase?

94,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this but I have no idea how to google my problem and do not want to bother a psychiatrist over something like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

In general, I would not really say I am depressed, but I do have brief episodes where it gets pretty bad. What I described in the title is something I have noticed happening more and more over the past few years. It always goes as follows. I will be in some situation, normally with other people, and I will build in happiness and feeling content. I love being around people in general, and I would usually characterize myself as being very lonely: perhaps I like being in company to avoid this. However I keep suddenly having these moments where I become extremely self-aware. It's almost as if I step outside of the situation and am looking at myself having a good time and feeling content. Suddenly I will remind myself that this moment is fleeting and no matter how good I feel now, this moment will pass and I will be back to feeling sad and lonely. This realization obviously triggers these feelings, and people have said they occasionally notice me suddenly slink away in a conversation and become withdrawn.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to stop these realizations from happening? 

&amp;#x200B;

It makes me less able to have fun and feel excited about things as I know I will inevitably come to one of these realizations, pre-emptively ruining any chance of feeling content or happy. ",05Jan2019,1
95,"I feel that my medicine isn't working as well as it used to. My husband and I live paycheck to paycheck and I do not have insurance. I use Dr. On Demand monthly to take care of my medicine.

Neither of us have family to help (came from terrible homes), he works 60-70 hours a week, I take care of my 5 year old and 6 year old. The oldest goes to Kindergarten, so I'm here with my youngest and take care of the family and household.

I feel like I need help. I haven't felt this awful since I first went to seek help. My anxiety has been higher than normal this week and my chest hurts. I felt like I'm in constant fight or flight. I'm usually in tears on on the verge. It's becoming harder to get daily stuff done. 

I finally lost it this afternoon and punched the dryer and kicked over the laundry. Immediately I sent my kids to the room and my husband help me come to. I was still frantic, but it soon turned to tears. I've been in tears for the past few hours. I can't bring myself together still. 

I've been in mental hospitals and done CBT, so I know how to cope, but lately it feels like no matter what I do, I'm drowning in depression and anxiety. 

What do I do? I'm sick to my stomach and I can't keep going like this. It isn't healthy for my girls.

98,"Hi All. My father died in November from lung cancer. It's been pretty difficult for my mother, my brother and me but my brother seems to be struggling the most. 
He's pushing everyone away and gets angry whenever anyone tries to suggest that he see a doctor or a therapist. 

His work is suffering (he runs a small business), his relationship with his partner (they have a son together who is two)  is suffering and neither me nor my mother know how we can help him. 

He is pretty reliant on cannabis unfortunately and I'm sure that's not helping but he seems to be blaming a lot of this on his partner saying that she's doesn't care about how he feels about our father and that she wasn't ever there for him. He says that she always questioned what was wrong when he started crying about it and I've tried to explain that when people are dying/ pass away, people don't know how to react. I'm pretty sure it's a perfectly normal reaction but it doesn't mean that she doesn't care at all.
