0,"Lately I've noticed that my paranoia was gotten worse overtime, years back it was in full-force but it seemed to disappear and become less of a problem.

But as if two days ago I've noticed it started to come back way worse than it has been in years. I heard a tapping sound and immediately almost had a panic attack before realizing it was my family in the other room. 

Went to my kitchen on the same night at around 1 am to get myself a snack, my heart starting racing cause I heard a few sounds and feared someone was in my backyard (even though there clearly wasn't) and i raced back into my room, I didn't come out again.

This morning i got up to go get the mail as I always do, I got to my door and started picking up the letters and magazines abd i started to hear people talking (people were crossing the street) and I dropped everything and ran back to my room. My heart again was racing and I couldn't breathe. I had to give myself the courage and strength to go back and pick everything up.

When I walked back to the door (I have windows next to my door) and felt like people were watching me through the curtains, (no one was even there) or people were waiting for me outside the door. I ran and just threw the mail on my table and secluded myself in my room.

What do I do?? I don't know if this is a bigger problem or if it's just my anxiety or what. I need as much help as i can get. Thank you",18Sep2019,2
1,"Before I begin F= Friend with poor mental health.

So I have a 15 yr old friend(F) who seems to be in a very poor mental state and I have been trying to support and listen to F for around a year now. I believed everything they said because I saw some evidence. F has anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and is possibly suicidal as I have seen scars but they have refused they are. F also mentioned how their parents don't believe them when it comes to their mental health issues.

Recently our friend group had a falling out with F and has told me how they think F has been lying about mostly everything, because of things like ""F doesn't act in the same way as most people do with depression"" and other things like that. At first, I was dismissive however I came to realise that I never stood back and evaluated the situation, which I normally do, and now I'm beginning to question what F said and I feel really bad for it.

I want to talk to F alone and ask if what they said was true and see if I can convince F that therapy and going to see a doctor isn't that bad. I don't know if this is a good idea or if I should not as it might affect them negatively. Also is there a way for teenagers in Scotland to seek help without parents consent.",18Sep2019,1

Use #Lavender #EssentialOil [etsy.me/2kHLBwJ](https://etsy.me/2kHLBwJ) aromatically to feel more focused and grounded; it can help improve concentration and mental clarity!

Add 2 - 3 drops of lavender essential oil to an air purifier, cool-air diffuser, or oil burner. You can also add a few drops of the oil with a carrier oil and inhale whenever you need something uplifting.

Sometimes my coworkers will be like ""Are you ok?"" and I don't know if they mean like jokingly, or like, seriously, and ah. But like when my anxiety comes I don't really even notice it, I guess because it's that bad. Like I panic over things like: Did I get there order right? Or I feel immediately bad if I rang up an order incorrectly or something, and I don't react that well towards criticism, and it kind of just overwhelms me and makes things harder for me at work. And like three coworkers have already used the ""Are you ok?"" on me, and it's not a bad thing necessarily. It's just like, I guess my anxiety must be that bad, that it's noticeable.

7,"Hi. So my (24f) boyfriend/exboyfriend/future husband (24m) was just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. 
His symptoms included depression, general anxiety about life, extreme changes in thoughts on life and himself, unable to keep social relationships, and often times self destructive behaviors. After doing some research on this disorder, I have to say that I can not argue his diagnosis. 
The problem is, we currently aren‚Äôt together. We want to be, but he hasn‚Äôt been able to be a part of this relationship in a healthy way. He‚Äôs been engaging in relationship destructive behaviors. 
I‚Äôve been trying to give him his space and allow him to get the help he needs without constantly pestering him or getting in the way of his healing, but I don‚Äôt know how any of this works. 
Is he going to be able to have a healthy relationship with me? Or is this not something he‚Äôll ever be able to heal from? Will he always have these behaviors? How can I forgive him for what he‚Äôs done? I don‚Äôt want to allow myself to be treated poorly just because he has this diagnosis, but it makes sense to me. I understand why these things have happened, but will they keep happening? Do I need to leave and stop waiting for something that will never get better?

8,"  These past couple of days, it's become very clear how much unresolved trauma I have. So many things that i thought didn't bother me or weren't that big of a deal have really influenced my personality, negative traits, and even negative traits more than I thought. 

  Sometimes it's too much to hold in, but I don't want someone close to me to judge me. I don't want to speak certain words out loud to a therapist who kinda knows me but doesn't at all. I don't want people in my personal life to know EVERYTHING about me. 

  I think it'd be a lot easier for some people like me-with unresolved issues they want to change, but have a hard time admitting-to talk with a stranger. Resolving problems starts by admitting you have them, but sometimes in order to heal, you have to realize where they stem from.

  So, I suggest a Life Story Swap. An exchange where we talk about our life, our traumas, our hardships. Our beginnings, and our roots. How often do we get to just lay it all out? 

  Comment if you'd like someone to message you to swap, or just even vent in the comments if that's what you need. You just have to get some things off your chest.",18Sep2019,2

18,"Ok so I, a 28 year old man am having one hell of a time mental health wise. For starters my (step)father died in May and everyone has said that I've changed. I still to this day cannot look at a picture of my father, I know that isn't normal but I just can't. I could always go to him to talk without any judgement. I also feel like I didn't do enough to show him how grateful I was for taking me as his own at 8 years old. I would take him out to eat every so often with the family and he would always apologize for being extremely rough on me as a child, and no matter how many times I told him it was fine, you did what you thought was best and was just trying to keep me out of trouble (didn't work). I feel as though he died lonely and didn't feel like anybody cared. I've become more quick tempered and I freak out over everything it seems like, which I know is wrong but I'm having trouble controlling my feelings. 
Secondly since March I've lost my house, my vehicle is completely done for, and my girlfriend and I are having serious issues. I've always took pride in being able to provide for my family, many times I will go without just to ensure everyone else is happy. I'm stuck living at my mom's again and billing for rides, and it makes me feel like I failed as a father and man. I'm trying to save money but I've got to get a house, a car, buy Christmas for my kids, and my youngest son's birthday is in November. I feel like I'll never get ahead and my kids will see me as a failure. 
Last but not least, my oldest two children and I have a terrible relationship. Their mom and I split when my son was 8 months and my daughter was a surprise. Their mom has always played the power position, I've got to do everything she says, when she says it or im not allowed to see my kids, or at least that's how it used to be. They are now 12 and 13 and because I've always been the bad guy at their moms they think they can order me around too. They don't like my girlfriend (who I have my youngest son with) and my son pretty much told me either I leave my girlfriend or he doesn't wanna he around. I'm tired of jumping through hoops to he involved so I told him that I'm not listening to a 13 year old give me an ultimatum. I don't feel like I should destroy a 2 parent household just to please my kids, it shouldn't be like that. I've tried to find some middle ground but literally nothing is good enough. 
In general I just feel like a terrible person who's negativity is effecting everyone around me. I do my best to make sure everybody is happy and taken care of while I'm barely hanging on. I'm under so much stress I feel like I'm gonna snap eventually.

21,"Throw away account for various reasons. 

In July my brother witnessed and was the first responder to a terrible trauma. The victim was his friend. This trauma wasn't his first. In the last five years he was also first on the scene to a motorcycle accident; the motorcyclist's brains leaked out onto my brother's hands as he held the man while he died. My brother was first on the scene to a terrible arial sport accident. He watched as his friend was airlifted to a nearby hospital with massive internal injuries and a broken pelvis. His friend died. He watched a man have his hands cut off as retribution for stealing food to feed his family. I know there were other awful things, but I don't know the particulars. 

My brother is a little different. He's kind of abrasive, and lacking in some of the niceties and social graces. He's opinionated, smart, well traveled, adventurous, and passionate. He's a closet misogynist, an intense loner with a huge heart and a need to give back. He's incredibly capable, but has always carried entitlement like a nasty chip on his shoulder. He wants to change the world. For the better. 

After this latest travesty, one that required him to manage the situation, the people around him, and the emergency services needed, my brother cracked. He dived into psychosis, losing touch with reality. We now suspect that he's probably been bipolar for a long time. There's a definite possibility of narcissistic personality disorder. He's experiencing PTSD related paranoid delusions. And those delusions; fuck, they're all encompassing, huge, endlessly detailed and convoluted. He's created a perfect mental box for himself. The box has no way out. The nature of his delusions won't allow him to seek or receive help for his PTSD. At times, he's certain there's nothing wrong with him. Why would someone who is experiencing delusions as absolute reality, someone who has nothing wrong with them, take meds or see a counselor? Answer: they wouldn't. 

And that's the crux of my problem. 

Several family members suffer from depression. I'm one of them. Depression is an old friend, though old enemy is a more accurate way to put it. But none of us have experience with this type of extreme mental illness. We don't know what to do. We don't know how to deal with him. We don't have any tools to help my brother in this situation. Unfortunately, the nature of HIPAA creates a horrible merry go round of legal obstacles that preclude us from getting help, acquiring tools, knowing what my brother's treatment plan is, when/whether he has a counseling appt, if he's taking meds. We're being stymied at every turn. 

My brother has been talking about suicide off and on, to multiple people, over the last two months. He has a timeline, a method, and his delusions give him a reason. He's also talked about how killing my parents might be more humane than allowing them to live. (This is the delusion talking. ""They"" are going to kidnap his family, hold them hostage, and probably torture them. I don't believe my brother is a danger to anyone other than himself, but you can't deny the twisted logic that it might be better to kill someone you love humanely than to let them be tortured and held hostage long term.)

My Mom's coping mechanism of choice has always been to stick her head in the sand, wear her happy smile, pray to the good Lord, and hope for the best. She's cockblocked the mobile crisis unit twice when they wanted to come get my brother and put him on an involuntary hold. Since my brother is at her house, and mobile crisis needs the homeowner's permission to come on site, my Mom's ""I think he's getting better"" shtick has been very effective. 

I can go around my parents. I know what the white sheet process is, and I've filled out the paperwork. It'll take one to three days for the paperwork to process and get signed by a judge, and then the cops go out - homeowner be damned - and pick up my brother and take him to a hospital.

If you've been in this situation, you know - or can probably imagine - all of the emotional gymnastics that my siblings and I are performing, and the possible family rifts I'm worried about causing. Will I permanently damage my relationship with my Mom if I go around her? Will my brother ever forgive me for having him involuntarily committed, when the thing he fears most in the world is to be locked in a hospital? Will my Dad be secretly pleased that I've taken this step, because someone is bucking my Mom, but it isn't his neck and marriage on the line? Will my other brother - the one who thinks I shouldn't have my ill brother committed - ridicule me, and make me feel guilty over taking this step for the rest of my life? Will putting my ill brother in the hospital, the place he fears, make his condition worse? Are the mental health professionals capable enough to help someone like this? Will the pros be taken in by my brother's ""All good here, I'm fit as a fiddle, just need some sleep"" routine? (He's been put on two involuntary short term holds and managed to snow the staff well enough to get out in short order both times.) 

And the scariest question of all: if I do nothing, will my brother end up dead? 

Because honestly, that's the only direction I can see this situation going. If left to his own devices, my brother will disappear, telling no one, and we'll never hear from him again. He'll probably die alone, in fear and pain, in the middle of the desert, after running out of gas and water. (There was a situation similar to this the first time we put him on an involuntary hold, so I'm not projecting much when I bring up this possibility.) Right now, my brother is too anxious and paranoid to leave the house. So the more likely scenario is that someone will find him dead after he's gobbled all of the antipsychotics he's been prescribed. (He stated that this was his plan just a few days ago.)

But here's the thing. Up until yesterday, I was certain that my brother wouldn't do the things he needs to do to get better. I know he's not taking his meds, but he totally surprised me by going to his psychiatrist appt yesterday. My brother cut the session short, saying he ""wasn't in the right head space"", made a follow up appt, and left. I don't know whether he actually talked to the psychologist about anything true. I don't know that he actually made a follow up appt. He won't tell anyone when the appt is. And because his delusions involve ""them"" monitoring him at all times, and ""they"" don't want him to talk about anything true, and because if he does talk truth ""they"" will kill/torture/blow up/maim/kidnap our family members, I HIGHLY doubt that my brother will ever get to the point that behavioral or talk therapy will work unless he's on meds to reduce his anxiety and dull the psychosis. 

So what the fuck to I do? My brother DID go to the appt yesterday. My brother also threatened suicide with a very specific doable plan last Friday. Do I wait and hope my brother does what he needs to? Or do I take my 99% certainty, based on the 42 years I've spend being my brother's sibling, and file the paperwork for involuntary commitment? 

It's a stupid question, right? If his life is in danger, I file the fucking paperwork. But based on the research I've done, one of the biggest precursors to curing paranoid delusions is the patient's willingness to be treated, and their ability to feel control in their own lives. Will saving his life by having him involuntarily committed erode what little control he feels he has to the point that his mental illness can't be cured or managed? 

I am heartbroken and riddled by doubts. If you've experienced this situation - either from the family/friend or the patient's POV - could you chime in? Let me know your thoughts, opinions; what worked for you, what definitely didn't?

26,"Hey family,

Recently I‚Äôve been in a serious depression and with severe anxiety flare ups. My situation is complex but I‚Äôll give it in as few words as possible. I‚Äôm 23, about to graduate college within the next year, living at home (toxic), in a relationship of 3 years (very up and down), and have real no social life (no friends/lack of human interaction). I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, Major depression and generalized anxiety, i display symptoms of manic behavior so my doctor thinks I‚Äôm probably a little bipolar but he didn‚Äôt make that a formal diagnoses. 

Up until a month ago I had been off any medication for probably 18 months. Everything seemed great for a while until my dog of 15 years died back in April and I became depressed. Fell back into some old habits and ended up having a seizure which brought me back to reality. Kicked that shit but still never got back to 100%. 

I stay active, workout 5-6x a week, stay busy. I think a lot of my problems stem from what I mentioned in the first paragraph. My dr put me back on my old medicine regiment (viibryd, klonopin) with an addition of lamictal. 

I‚Äôm really just looking for some support. The last couple months have just been a string of one bad day after another. I see a therapist but I can only afford an hour a week and it‚Äôs easier to express myself to a screen then it is a person sometimes. Thank you all for all the compassion you share with each other.",18Sep2019,2
27,"My mother is a woman who likes to think too much and diagnoses herself with things constantly. She diagnosed herself with Hashimoto's Disease many years ago and was actually correct, but she did not want medication or her thyroid removed. So, inevitably, she discovered the phenomenon of ""clean eating."" No GMOs, no gluten, grass-fed, organic, etc. Deodorant causes breast cancer, food can cure cancer, etc. Have to use organic lube. Can't use tampons.

She has tried to sneak things in mine and my father's foods. She cooked our foods with coconut oil, tried sneaking vegetables in our food without our consent. This isn't major in itself, but the fact she was forcing us to abide by her lifestyle whilst also constantly accusing us of being ""sick"" and listening to ""fake science"" (modern medicine) is. 

I had an acute inner and outer ear infection a few years ago. It was so painful I cried for 4 straight hours, and she refused to take me to the hospital because they'd prescribe me antibiotics and ""ruin my gut."" My father ended up getting in an argument with her and took me anyway. It was gone in a week, and my pain was instantly ended when I got an ear wick.

She constantly makes aggressive comments toward us and puts us on the defense, and whenever we don't agree with what she's saying, she shuts down and yells.

There has been two divorce threats over the past 5 years, the second being recent. She went out and got drunk a few weeks later, and the night that she did, I witnessed my father sobbing for the first time in my life. He couldn't speak, it was all incoherent cry-talk. She confronted us, was throwing things around, she even stood in front of my bedroom door staring at me for at least 10 minutes without saying anything (very creepy) before leaving. I didn't talk because if I did, she'd start yelling again in her drunken state.

Just an hour or two ago, my mother and father got into another argument. My mother slammed the door repeatedly so hard that the trims came off, and she screamed at the top of her lungs multiple times.

The entire family says she needs treatment, two saying she needs to be institutionalized. At our previous attempt at counseling, the psychologist said he suspects she has Borderline Personality Disorder and more. Our family thinks she is orthorexic as well.

Specifically, my father and sister seem perturbed by my unmasked self. I love them but I can't mask anymore. I began to forget who I was and I don't want to forget again.

29,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So lately, I had a few spells of nostalgia hit me whenever I hear older songs. I want to go back to earlier times, even though its impossible. Hell I'm nostalgic for the 80s and 90s, and I wasn't even born yet (2001). It always makes me sad and I cry because of it. Anyone know how to cope with this? 

Thanks alot",18Sep2019,1
30,"There are so many of us on here, and so few of us find the answers we need. I think even fewer of us have someone in our lives that actually understands the mindset of depression. 

There are a ton of people who tell us they understand what we are going through, but we know they don't. They are trying to help and we can at least appreciate the attempt. 

I've been down low. Dipped my toes into the void, and now find myself in a pretty good place mentally. I have a simple, no-bullshit, no-religion view of the world and accepting it has somehow made me feel better.

I am a man in the DFW area and if anyone is needing someone to talk to and you are stable and need a pick me up, there are several places around the area that have great food. I think we could all benefit from having more friends who really, actually understand us.

32,"I‚Äôll probably wind up deleting this, but I just wanted to rant about my paranoia. It doesn‚Äôt completely stop me from going through life, but it IS a huge impediment. I sometimes get paranoid that someone is watching me, or that I‚Äôm being followed, or that I‚Äôm being hacked, or that someone innocent has sinister intentions...I usually don‚Äôt like being out of the house alone as a result (and unfortunately, I don‚Äôt really have many friends so I‚Äôm basically home all the time). I‚Äôve had a couple incidents where my paranoia reared its ugly head in front of acquaintances, who I‚Äôm sure secretly think I‚Äôm crazy. I really fucking hate the paranoia sometimes, even as it‚Äôs cooled down over the years.

33,"Ive been struggling with my mental health for about 8 years now since I was about 16. I had a failed suicide attempt around that point in my life and began getting therapy and seeing a psychiatrist regularly and was diagnosed with Borderline Personality. After awhile I eventually quit seeing both due to financial issues. Around the age of 20 I began abusing alcohol, however when i was 22 I sobered up completely hoping it would change something.

Over the last couple years ive steadily felt less and less emotion I guess is the only way to put it. I havent cried in about 6 years and any time I feel like I should cry the closest I can get is feeling like I might cry but not ever actually being able to cry. I feel suicidal every single day but then I feel like why should I even bother and never go through with it. I havent felt happy in years and dont even really feel depressed anymore. I just dont feel anything. At most I may feel minor annoyances at work or by being around people I dont really care for. 

I have been avoiding people almost completely outside of work because I feel like no one would want to be around me because I usually just stay quiet and keep to myself and never really show any emotion, and every day the argument in my head to kill myself becomes more logical but I really just dont want my family to have to deal with it. Im just kind of at a loss for what I should do at this point. I cant afford to go back to therapy as I am barely making it paycheck to paycheck now. Any advice would be thankful. I am from the USA",18Sep2019,1

36,"I‚Äôve struggled with severe anxiety for most of my adolescence and occasional bouts of depressive tendencies (never been officially diagnosed with depression but really never saw someone who could give a diagnosis) Anyways, I‚Äôve swung really low for the past few weeks and its been debilitating at times. To the point where multiple people tell me I‚Äôm acting weird. I know I should see a counselor (im in college so its readily available to me) but I‚Äôve always had issues about communicating my feelings in a counseling setting. 

I feel like I can never get my point across. Also, talking about my problems seems to deepen the pain that I already feel and my initial instinct is obviously to avoid pain. So the thought of doing so heightens my anxiety. 

I also hold the irrational fear that they will tell me that my problems really aren‚Äôt that bad and I‚Äôm overreacting. Even though I know its dumb it still terrifies me that my pain could be invalidated. 

If you have any advice for how to approach counseling  with a different mindset (or just reassurance at this point) it would be much appreciated.",18Sep2019,3
37,"I feel like this irrational fear is gonna ruin my life. It rules my life. I already don't have friends because two were toxic and my ex boyfriend drove me away from everyone else I was friends with, you know he was a real clinically defined psychopath. And now I have a fear of people fucking with my head and laughing at me because that's all that happened literally all through middle school and high school. Everyone gets close to you, takes from you, laughs at you, and leaves. That's what my brain convinces me and I have suicidal thoughts because I can't just be normal like everyone else. I can't just trust people. I can't just live a normal life where people don't gaslight me left and right and left and right. I feel like a walking target for: murderers, rapists, kidnappers, sex traffickers, users, abusers, emotional abusers, gaslighters, people who befriend you and scam you, bullies, and more. Because I am. I'm not smart - the eBay buyer that bought my baby snails told me she has a zoo and her kids called it the snail kingdom and up until yesterday in the shower I'd thought I sent it to an actual zoo. I told my coworkers about it and wondered why they looked at each other as if something I said was funny. How stupid can someone be? I have no common sense. I can memorize facts but I have no common sense. I feel like a stupid bafoon and natural selection can and will take me out via whatever alley I venture as a walking fucking target. 

Now that I've used dramatic words like venture and bafoon, I am still feeling like shit, bit slightly less drab shit. I visualize what it would be like if I just killed myself and my mom would be very sad. I feel bad that she would be sad but what is she missing? A warm body that sits in the house, gives her hugs now and then, and doesn't treat her as nice as it should. Would my dad miss me? He'd probably be relieved that I'm not eating all the food, opening my window to gasp at smoke free air and causing the electric bill to go up, that there's no car to pull down to make room for his, that I'm not interrupting his TV show, that I'm not badgering him with stories about the only hobby I pursue, being a fucking snail mother. Me and my snails. I'm just a lonely, fully physically capable person wasting their life on a psychology degree, trying to escape worst case scenarios, and dropping pieces of zucchini into a box of water to oogle at invertebrates feeding. Today I made a timelapse of my snails crawling around the fish tank. 

You know what another 19 year old girl did today? Dressed up in a cute outfit, accentuated her natural beauty with makeup, did her hair, went on a date with her long time boyfriend who understands her and is reasonable with her, who lives her, and got engaged. She told her 2 best friends and parents about it, hugging her mom and dad and returning to their apartment where they have safety locks, a dog, and movie nights and cuddling and texting their friends and parties and trust. She posted a picture on Instagram and got all her friends commenting ""you look beautiful!"" And ""you are perfect for each other!"" 

While I play back a six second video that took 16 minutes to make of 12 snails crawling in all directions and try to pet my dog who's had enough of my obsessive snuggling so far today, that girl is wiping down her counter after dinner and listening to music that she likes and that nobody else told her to like and exchanging a smile with her new fiance in the next room and her phone just went off because her supportive best friend told her she always knew they were gonna get married. I had a boyfriend, I had a best friend, I had dreams, I had parents, I had a life and they weren't real. I said once when I was twelve, my whole life feels like ""almost but not really."" Almost got it, but I was let down. Almost went there, but something happens. Almost didn't happen again, but mom's back on drugs. Almost not again, but mom's drunk. Almost didn't get my feelings hurt again but he told me he only dated me because he pitied me. And I feel like this is my personal hell where i get to see everyone else doing things I could never do. Don't even get me started on being ugly. I know. I've been in this body for long enough to figure it out. I deserve love, I deserve compassion, I deserve happiness. It's clear to me that those things don't just happen to you because you chase after them or because you ""deserve"" them. They come to you because you are lucky and beautiful. They happen because you had the right resources to invite those things into your life AND those things were in the right place at the right time. I don't have that. I don't have good luck. I don't have those resources. I don't have social skills, I don't pick up on things because I don't have common sense, I'm not good at flirting, I'm not beautiful, and more importantly, a lot of men fucking suck the life out of you because to them you are three holes and a rubix cube. 

I am stuck I am alone and I am, as far as my potential, a sad story. If my life is a movie, at best it's the homeless man who overdosed in a lifetime movie. Such a small, sad, insignificant fart in the wind. Its like I can't save myself. And nobody can save me because that's not their fucking job. I don't have a place here on earth, there is nothing here for me. I sit and watch snails for fucks sake. I buy laundry detergent with coupons from the dollar store for fun while old men make comments about how it's my fault there's a big line. I buy scent beads and fabric softener because maybe I'll smell less like cigarettes and laundry is fun because I smell the clothes before I put them in the dryer and imagine that I'm someone who doesn't live in a smokers home, I imagine that I'm doing laundry for my husband and I imagine that he's gonna walk into our laundry room and smile at me as he passes by because we love each other. When I put on lotion after a shower to mask the smell of cigarettes, I imagine that I do it because it makes me feel pretty. When I put my sunglasses on I tell myself it's because I'm beautiful and that it makes me look hot, but it's really because I feel more confident when my small eyes and uneven eyebrows are hidden. I feel beyond ""fixing"" like I'm broken or something, I feel helpless and hopeless and I feel like the last fart that homeless man let out as he overdosed in his homeless man house under a bridge",18Sep2019,2
38,"So I don‚Äôt know if I was actually diagnosed as mentally ill, but I got sent to a hospital for two weeks so I think I was. Anyways basically I had a breakout because of my dad saying something bad about me, can‚Äôt remember what but it was just like something random. So he said that and I started to fight him and I got the cops called on me that‚Äôs all I can remember. Anyways they sent me to a mental hospital apperantly cause I‚Äôm mental???? I honestly think it‚Äôs my fuckin dads fault completely. I remember my sister telling me stories about him hitting her with her toys. And I also remember all the times he would whip me with a belt weather or not I did something wrong as a kid like yell at him. Not only that but I remember the voice recordings of him screaming at me and I don‚Äôt know if this happened before the incident but he hit my grown sister when she was trying to defend me. And then I guess I developed the strong hate against him that I acted aggressively towards him. I don‚Äôt know if I remembered all these events when I did it but I sure know he‚Äôs to blame for my decisions there. Anyways yeah they sent me to a mental hospital with a typical we just want to help you type shit. After surviving that hospital with absolutely nothing learned that was ever useful to me at all, I stayed another two weeks but just partially a day. I don‚Äôt know why I took me so long to remember all the things he has done to me and why I didn‚Äôt say them at the hospitals. However I think it‚Äôs because nobody would really trust me anyways because of the obvious stereotype and I just forgot. After that I started seeing this shitty ass guy that tried guess what I had ‚Äúwrong with me‚Äù (forgot what it was called) and he said he believed I had a brain tumor that‚Äôs causing me to think aggressively. I was pretty young at that time I think I was around 10. Now I‚Äôm older and I can say that I think it‚Äôs my parents fault. They influenced me on so many levels weather it be the physical hitting as playing or the whipping in general or whatever. I think that because I was younger than I am now I was growing out of the habit as getting treated as a fuckin dog and started rebelling against him more often. Because there had been some stuff leading up to that as well. Anyways now I‚Äôm being seen as a mentally ill person I guess I could go on so if you want to see part two reply to me.

40,"I haven't done any of the things I said I'd do. We always come up with cool things to document or work on and I never do them. Literally it all depends on me to do the work and improve my life and I just can't bring myself to focus on stuff like that. I can't even remember or focus enough to bring in a folder of previous work I have completed. I'm struggle to keep up with classes, caring for my pet, cleaning up the apartment, keeping up with finances.... I'm always doing the bare minimum last minute. For years and the entirety of my adult life, I have struggled with disorganization and a lack of genuine effort. I know the key is self discipline but I just can't.

I have anxiety, which is whatever, but it impacts my social experiences and I stress out over stupid stuff. I don't have friends here and I'm stuck alone at college for a year in an attempt to finish. So far I've half tried getting closer to acquaintances but I don't have the guts to actually put myself out there. I've applied for like 8 jobs and have heard nothing back. Part of me questions if I could even handle it.

Part of me feels that therapy isn't going in the direction that I need. I started with CBT, and it worked for a minute, but nothing long term. After years of struggle, I have tried DBT for schemas. My therapist assured me I don't have BPD but she hasn't given my any diagnosis. I'm currently doing schema therapy and I can just feel myself succumbing to my schemas. I think schema therapy ignores what I believe are traumas... my therapist has never uttered the word even though I've told her everything that I find traumatic and that has affected me and weights on my mind daily. It appeared she understood at least somewhat when she had me do this weird exercise where I closed my eyes ,imagined a safe space, and confront my abusive father. I cried and that was it. I don't really get it. Also, my brother molested my sister for years and I had no idea until my sister casually told me. Nothing can describe the pain. (I told the police and convinced my sister to go to the police, it affected my family and it disturbs me deeply, but overall nothing happened). In therapy, I was able to speak about every step initially as it happened, but that was it. After so long, I broke down, expressing that it feels like these issues don't matter in therapy, and she apologized and said we could focus on finding ways to help the situation. Overall, I had goals to help my sister, which was great. But I still feel affected. She didn't care about my nightmares of my brother. I just feel so dismissed. Yes, a lot of this stuff is quite in the past, yes it's bad to ruminate, but I see my sister struggle with alcoholism. I don't get to have normal relationships with certain family members and it kills me. I don't expect anything special or magic to happen in therapy but I just didn't expect to feel so dismissed?

I have plenty of reasons to be stressed. My pet has a minor health issue, my boyfriend almost broke up with me, I have a lot of coursework, my sister is an alcoholic and I worry, my mom is on pills, my grandpa has a tooth infection and he's in pain, and I just can't stop thinking about the past. I'm just trying to distract myself from my stress as much as possible, I'm just trying to forget everything and focus on things I want to do. My memory is shit and it's scaring me. Whenever I make myself tend to responsibilities I need to recover by wasting the night on my laptop, for example. I'm just an absolute mess. I don't have a mom or dad to help me. I'm just this dumb blob. Overall I'm just too fucked up to focus on self improvement. Now I have to go to therapy and just be a huge failure. I have to go because I already skipped the last session.

I've brought up the fact that I'm struggling again with major stressors, yet my mom just dismisses me and says that she ""cant just shut everyone up"" and I understand that. I don't want her to be a dictator and control others lives; I just wish she'd understand mine more. 

I make sure not to bother her during days where she's standoffish. I do the work she asks of me, and extra to keep her happy.

And then you check again? Imagine doing that continuously for 5 minutes. Now imagine that with the fridge. Or anything similar. Now granted these issues are brought upon by likely genetics as my mother has the same problem. When they first showed up they were pretty bad. Like really bad. You ever had a random voice in your head that was just you trying to confirm your own negative anxieties. Fortunately through about a year or two I curbed these problems and they are not nearly as bad. Now they appear to manifest as a different problem, lack of self worth. I don‚Äôt want to be arrogant. Not In the eyes of anyone else but more-so myself. Voices of me move through my head telling me things like I‚Äôm not unique, or that I don‚Äôt deserve any recognition. As taking any amount of credit or calling my self superior in any fashion would be me being an arrogant prick. To be clear these are not the kind of schizophrenic voices often described but more my own impulsive mind trying to reconcile theses thoughts.

I have many mental  health issues that have been diagnosed. My partner  has none but agreed to go get a check up do to recent events.

We were going to talk to the doctor  about bipolar, and have scheduled to see one. I'm so confused cus as of rn they just left the house flipping me off in of of rage. They took their car keys with them. And I'm worried where they will go or what they will do. I know they have some suicidal thoughts sometimes when depression gets bad. 
First off they have a major issue with education  system currently in place (north America) and sees them as not worth time or money. They were not going to go to school at first but then a year after grad decided to go to college with me for a few reasons and one being their parents  pressure. But they let that anger of the system get to them too much so then when deadlines arise it's a major issue, stress is high, Freaking out is common, and bursts of anger. Most of the time I can sit with them and minimalize it. This time I was doing so but they looked at everyone else's submission and said theirs was garbage and not on topic. (Online course) I felt as if they were doing it properly and on subject, and they let others work paranoid them. 
Which then all lead to a bad freak out of ripping paper, throwing, locking in a room and more.

I‚Äôve been taking them all for about a year, and haven‚Äôt had any of them for about 10 days now. Two years ago I got really sick, almost died, lost all my hair, and have been severely depressed ever since, to the point where functioning on a daily basis is like climbing Mt. Everest

It took a while for me to finally find a combination of meds that works. Even so I always wondered if they really did work since they didn‚Äôt really make me feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù, they just helped me feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Now that I‚Äôve been off of them I realize they really do work, because I‚Äôve been feeling incredibly far from normal. I work 40hrs a week, was trying to go back to college, feeling fine but things have just been getting progressively worse

I‚Äôm barely getting out of bed, barely making it through work, my whole personality has changed and everyone can see it. All I gotta do to get back to school is go to the library and print and submit a dumb piece of paper but that simple task just seems monstrous. I literally just wanna eat and sleep and that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm irritable as heck. But my Vyvanse alone is like $380 a month!

67,"Background: I‚Äôm a woman in my mid-20s with PTSD from sexual assault. I‚Äôd been seeing this male psychiatrist for a couple of years. 

Earlier this year, I had some experiences in therapy with him which were just inappropriate imo, like him complimenting my appearance, him referring to himself as ‚Äúuncle‚Äù instead of my doctor etc. and sometimes he would look at me in ways that made me feel really creeped out. But I kept dismissing these things because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a psychiatrist, he wouldn‚Äôt be inappropriate, this is my past making me sensitive‚Äù. 

The second last time I saw him was bad. It was normal in that there were some little odd things and I felt uncomfortable, but it was the first time he touched me. It was NOT sexual but it was totally unnecessary and deeply uncomfortable and just felt very wrong. The vibe was very creepy and my instinct was to run but I was frozen. After this appointment I started reflecting on the things he‚Äôd been doing and saying, and questioning if he was grooming me in a way to become okay with increasingly unprofessional behaviour ‚Äî but then I told myself that was ridiculous.

The last time I saw him was when things were really wrong. The things he said... I can honestly just describe it as dirty talk. And he was clearly aroused by this. It was disgusting. I couldn‚Äôt speak or move, I was in total shock by what was happening. He started to ask me a very private question and I looked at the door because I wanted to leave (but couldn‚Äôt move) so he stopped talking and paused for the longest and most awkward silence ever. Then eventually he changed the topic like nothing had happened. 

I left after the appointment and decided to never go back. It‚Äôs been months and this won‚Äôt leave me. I feel disgusting just for experiencing what happened. I feel disgusting for knowing how he looked at me, what he was thinking about me, what he said to me. It won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm scared people will think I‚Äôm overreacting. This has affected me so much. I‚Äôve told a couple of people some of what happened but not all of it and it‚Äôs out of shame. I don‚Äôt know what to do to move past how this is affecting me. Nothing that bad even happened, it was mostly the shock and betrayal, but I feel so disgusting.

69,"I have ADHD and suicidal tendencies.

Ever since I was little, I would have impulses that were different than other impulses. They were different because usually, an impulse for me was me doing something without thinking. These special impulses are these thoughts that press into me increasingly until I can't think about anything else.  It's like a crazy painful, all-consuming itch. I either fulfill this ""itch"" or I distract myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

 These impulses were harmless at first. Like, slamming a door, kicking a ball in a certain way, doing my homework with another hand. However, they have become darker and more violent as of late. But not violent towards others; violent to myself. These thoughts press into me, and eventually consume me unless I can distract myself.

I had (still have) anxiety from having anxiety and fear of panic attack that will cause panic attack. Now tho I realised that the only trigger, the only thing thats causing it is the fear itself. The fear of having anxiety, the fear of having panic attack and the fear that when Im distracted and feeling well, it will return. Also the fear of just thinking of it and worrying about it when distracted will bring those feelings back. Its THE FEAR!

My partner experiences hypomanic phases of about one to two weeks followed by depressive phases for about two to three weeks, continuing back and forth. 

She's been diagnosed for years, but only recently her depressive symptoms have been notably worse. 

She's:

- Lost interest in her lifetime career goal 

- Cut off remaining friendships 

- Isolating herself from everyone (myself included) during her depressive phase

- Much more emotional. Crying, upset, sad, etc.

- Confused why all of this is happening

81,"I (21F) don't have an eating disorder (nor am I in any way underweight - if anything I have a very 'healthy'-looking, athletic/muscular physique), but ever since I experienced a traumatic event a couple years ago, I have problems maintaining/establishing a 'normal' relationship with food. I can't remember the last time I ate a normal, regular sit-down meal, or had a meal without feeling a bit guilty.

A lot of the times when I feel very anxious/nervous/overwhelmed, I'll have a binging &amp; purging episode. However, because I'm not experiencing stressful situations \*all\* the time, the frequency at which these occur is quite irregular. End of August/beginning of September is usually a difficult time for me, especially having to be at home with my parents, so I'll b/p maybe 1-2x a day, up to 5-6 days a week. But during the summertime or spring, for example, I go months without having a single episode.  I also \*hate\* feeling full, and it has come to the point where food will just come up on its own (using my stomach muscles?? sorry for TMI). I feel as though because of how irregular it is, I don't have an actual 'problem'. If anything, I feel as though binging &amp; purging serve as a sort of beneficial self-regulatory behaviour, and it feels \*incredibly\* cathartic. Like I'm ridding myself of negative emotions in a tangible way. 

I'm beginning to get a better sense of emotional 'triggers' (god, I hate this word) which are more likely to set off an episode. Some of the main ones include BOYS, academic stress, family stress, and an overall sense of feeling emotionally overwhelmed. The reason why I say I'm getting a 'better sense' of recognising these is because I've noticed a pattern where I'll start feeling weirdly anxious/muddy inside, and the feeling will just grow and grow until I binge &amp; purge, which then brings about a feeling of absolute calmness. 

It has never been out of control to the point where I require external help, and it helps me feel very much in control of myself. Of course, I \*could\* find another activity/behaviour to cope with these feelings, but I don't feel as though this is THAT wrong. I don't see this as something I need 'help' for, and if anything I feel as though it is helpful in a f\*cked up way. Is this okay? Am I normalising this too much? Is this normal?",18Sep2019,1
82,"As a little background, I (23f) have been struggling with anxiety for about 6 years. When I was in high school, I ended up passing out in class after someone tripped and cut their head open. I got overwhelmed by the sight of the blood. The next thing I remembered was being under a desk surrounded by a mix of staff and friends. I ended up having a moderate concussion. After this incident, I really struggled in the classroom. I started having several panic attacks a day. I began associating the classroom setting with the panic attacks. However, they eventually spread to other settings like when I was driving or at work. I refused to take medication because I was worried about the side effects. I also had a hard time finding a therapist, so I gave up the search for one. 

I went to a university after I graduated high school ( I somehow managed to maintain good grades and graduate in the top 15% of my class). I continued to struggle mentally/emotionally throughout the 4 years, but over time felt like I was improving as I developed coping strategies. The amount of panic attacks I was having reduced over time, and I got to the point where they were sporadic and only when I was in class. 

I'm currently working towards my master's in social work. In the beginning, I thought I could never get through a program where most assignments were presentation based (mostly role plays so I can't really prepare a script).

 I talked with my doctor, and I decided that even though I'm in a much better place, medication could be beneficial for me. I'm taking 20mg of fluoxetine. It's been a little more than a month, and honestly I'm feeling the way I did before the panic attacks started. I haven't needed my prn xanax once. 

Just this past week, I've been a completely different person. I've been confident at my field placement and seeing just how good of a social worker I can be. I talked in class (which pretty much never happens). I didn't panic during a presentation. I've  been more social. I even took point on contacting someone about an issue on behalf of a group I'm in. It's absolutely incredible.

85,"To start, my sister is the most loving, sweet, kind, beautiful person I have ever known.  She recently moved back home after FINALLY escaping a toxic and extremely unhealthy relationship with the father of her two kids.

To put it simply, it has been soo difficult.  I barely recognize her, my heart is literally in pieces, and I‚Äôm constantly trying to come up with ways to comfort and support her, and I feel it‚Äôs not making any difference. 

I just wanted to ask if you guys think some things she said is strange or not, for example she said earlier today that she believes we are all under a ‚Äúmicroscope‚Äù and being researched? By aliens or some other form of life.  The other day she said that the lizards are all looking at her...we live in Hawaii, and they are literally everywhere so welp...

She also just gave birth to her second son a little over a month ago. I know how hard this is for her but I literally keep encouraging her with positivity and love, although she‚Äôll make remarks at me when I try to help with anything at all.  Just earlier tonight, I corrected my nephew just by simply telling him to throw his rubbish away, and she snapped at me, I‚Äôve noticed he doesn‚Äôt listen to her, and will wreck the whole house, she just lets him do whatever he wants mostly, and will lash out on him as well, apathetically.  I‚Äôm afraid for her, but mostly for the kids.  She has a history of anger problems as well, and has even tried to kill me before when we were children.  I never understood it as we have lived a pretty happy comfortable life.  

She has been in the mental ward two times already, and last time was diagnosed with schizophrenia but we all felt it was misdiagnosed.  Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt be there to witness, as she moved off island with the boyfriend.  I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe it is true, and I‚Äôm completely lost at what to do.

Whenever she is trying to have a conversation as well she will do alot of mumbling, and confusion, indecisive thoughts run havoc in her mind.  She doesn‚Äôt wanna accept any help from me, it can be as simple as washing the dishes, or picking up toys, or even how we are going to leave the house.  Everything needs to be planned and ends up being very complicated, and it‚Äôs so overwhelming to even spend 5 minutes with her because of the indecisiveness and negativity.  She‚Äôs constantly explaining herself and her actions, and when she feels misunderstood she tends to act very passive aggressively.

I‚Äôm also 6 months happily pregnant, and am afraid that she is going to hurt me, as she has attacked me before as an adult.  It‚Äôs the way she looks at me when she gets in these moods, it‚Äôs a very evil, emptiness inside her glare.  It‚Äôs pretty frightening to live with her as I‚Äôm constantly watching everything I say and do, but she tends to find something always wrong...it‚Äôs very difficult as well because now we are sharing a kitchen, and I haven‚Äôt been able to eat regularly since.  

I know it sounds like I‚Äôm just pointing the finger, but I literally have always been there for her, and am honestly never mean or cruel to her.  I‚Äôm constantly trying to help and uplift, and she will always find a way to find a fault in anything I‚Äôm doing.  It usually happens at night time as well, idk if that makes a difference.

86,"I'm honestly not sure what's wrong with me, but I'm beginning to think it's something severe. 

I've shown so many signs since I was little. When I was very little I used to have to have people say things in a certain tone or else I thought they were saying it ""wrong"", I used to have to repeat something someone told me to say word for word  or else I got nervous and began to cry, and I had to touch everything I walked by in the grocery store a certain amount of times. 

I grew out of that, but started showing other signs. I first noticed my anxiety in first grade when I got a B- and my teacher had to point out to me that I was shaking. I then proceeded to throw up in the middle of class. For years after that I would get so, so nervous for tests. I would cry in the middle of class almost every day because I was so nervous, but no one ever put pressure on me to be like that. 

Eventually I grew out of that and my insecurities took over. In high school I became obsessed with losing weight and developed an eating disorder. I felt beautiful only when I was hungry. It started out with me wanted to lose 5 pounds, but I became obsessed. 

I grew out of that, and am now 20 but honestly I feel like I'm at my worst in terms of mental health. My anxiety is so bad that if I think someone is mad at me I can not talk to them. I throw up if I do. My insecurities are so bad that I don't believe anyone in the world finds me pretty even though I get lots of Male attention and make money literally off of my looks at the moment. 

I have an amazing fiance, but I know I make him miserable. I'm constantly asking if he thinks I'm pretty and I'm always taking small things he does out of context and thinking it means he doesn't care. And if I get something in my brain I have to keep asking him about it over and over and over until my brain will let me stop thinking about it. If not I start shaking and throw up.

At first my psychiatrist tried to switch my ADHD medication since he thought it was a side effect (as it sometime is). After going  back and forth with a number of different medications and no changes to my mental health, my psychiatrist asked me and my parents to fill out depression questionnaires.

Fathers gone and mother has no idea about my problems and im also not close to her in that way. My siblings are all on their own and dont live with me anymore. i also dont have a SO and iv never been in a relationship before. Basically i feel alone and i dont know who to talk to or how to talk to them. It would be so out of the blue for anyone im close to. So i need advice. How should i approach this problem?,18Sep2019,1

93,"Depression for me is always a sign that I need to spend some time with myself, figuring out the cause, and what needs to change in order to implement a solution. I think a lot of people try to avoid the feeling of dread, hopelessness, anxiety and depression, but that just leads to a build up of tension and problems that people haven't taken the time to solve. Without solving, or at least paying attention to what's on your mind, it will never truly leave. It will always come back, especially after you've distracted yourself with something that's ineffective for the actual relief or solution of your problems. 

Welcome the intrusive thoughts, and let them be discussed within yourself or with another, work through it, go deep, and then when you're ready, say goodbye and move on. Let the feelings pass through your body. In, and out. This way, they leave, they don't get bottled up and stored for another day.",18Sep2019,1

You were all super kind, helpful and insightful. I did speak to my mum again and she reluctantly agreed that maybe I did need to talk to someone, but that it would take a long time on the NHS and that she did not want me to be put in medication. She also tried to diagnose me herself with ‚Äúdepression caused by over exercising‚Äù (in fairness I do exercise a hell of a lot, but it‚Äôs one of the only things I enjoy). Bless her, obviously she has my best interests at heart but she is from a generation that never had therapy and never discussed mental health.

Luckily, this is when my friends decided to spring into action. My two best friends in the world, who don‚Äôt understand how much I appreciate them. And while I am not a best friend to either of them, I am still a friend to them. They went and told someone at my school that they were worried about me and now I have a meeting tomorrow with someone to arrange getting mental health support.

It was the one thing I considered myself to have a a strength in. Diagnoses: Major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder(re-advised to General Anxiety disorder later, since at first I was mostly concerned over social things but a psychiatrist eventually figured out I'm also anxious over just about anything), and dissociative disorder (not specified)  


Now, as I watch myself to have either a mental/cognitive decline, it just feeds itself into more and more worry, anxiety, self-loathing, hate... etc it seems like it is now self-fulfilling. But there definitely was an issue at first because it started at one point... I don't feel like I can make anyone take it seriously enough, since it seems like people haven't been. Idk what to do.

99,"Hi. New here. 

I just got prescribed prozac after years and years of trying to white knuckle my way through anxiety and depression. 

It was really hard for me to ask for help. In my family we don't talk about this kind of stuff. Growing up if you were feeling depressed or just in a pissed off mood you got told to ""change the attitude"" or ""you want sympathy? Go find it in the dictionary."" So reaching out and asking for help was really really tough for me.

But I put on my big boy pants and went to my doctor for my yearly physical. After the usual stuff he asked if there was anything I wanted to talk about. I told him about my anxiety. About how little things would piss me off and have me stewing in anger for hours. He was very understanding. He prescribed prozac. I took my first pill last night. 

I've lurked on this sub for a while. The comments of support showed that I wasn't alone. It made me want to post here at the start of my journey to get right.",18Sep2019,1

I was diagnosed with ADD in the 9th grade, I could never focus on anything that didn‚Äôt require fast action(video games, sports, etc). Things like school, conversation, &amp; simple tasks were always and continue to be a struggle, well not school anymore because I graduated college somehow but now I have a full time job which is similar to school in terms of focus for me(yes this is a run on sentence, sue me). What I‚Äôm getting to is I never know what the fuck I‚Äôm doing, what I want in life, who I am, anything. I have a good friend group and family I like to think. My temper and social issues have deferred me from being close with anyone other than my ex girlfriend who accepted me for myself. I was in a relationship for almost 5 years which ended in February right before Valentine‚Äôs Day due to loss of connection, no hard feelings or anything. I drank almost every night I could, self harmed multiple times, gained a lot of weight, stopped going to the gym, the whole works. Thought about suicide but that was all it ever was, a thought. I‚Äôm in a better place from then but not a great place. Stopped drinking to numb pain and only drink for recreation on the weekends, haven‚Äôt self harmed in months, go to the gym 5 days a week now, diet has been better. Physically I feel a lot better, mentally varies from day to day. I have days where I get home from work and cry in my room until I fall asleep, I have days where I get home feeling on top of the world. I was recently called out on my temper(which I think stems from having ADD) by my friends but now they‚Äôre using it to justify anything. They say I‚Äôm passive aggressive via text on certain topics when they say similar things and no one else will call them out. It feels unfair to me. I‚Äôm never confident in if I‚Äôm right or wrong and have a tough time making confident decisions unless there is pressure. I have a really bad working memory, I can‚Äôt remember names, I forget tasks that are given to me when I don‚Äôt write them down, my social anxiety gets in the way of a lot of things which makes it hard to be who I think I‚Äôm supposed to be. I hope this all makes sense and yes I know it‚Äôs scattered, I don‚Äôt know how to structurally write. What I‚Äôm getting at is that I‚Äôm lost in life.

101,"I have been struggling to get through different university courses for about 6 years. I've taken time off at times and I finally thought I found a career and course that I was happy with. However, I decided to take on some hobbies to find new passions and meet new people. I got into theatre, and got cast in a theatre production, the first one that I auditioned for. I was only doing it as a hobby, but I loved every minute of it. The rehearsals and the time I had to put in. Once it came time for the production to open, we peformed over 2 weeks. This was 2 of the best weeks of my life. I had such good feedback and everyone said I was a natural. 

Also, there was another guy that was in the cast with that wants to do acting and screenwriting as a career. He plans to write a TV show and wanted me to help him write it. And finally, for years now I've been wanting to try stand-up comedy. I've been writing joke ideas in my phone for about 2 years now, and this creative bug that I've caught has a lit a fire under me and made me want to start writing stand-up sets and perform.

Now, I know all of this can be done as a hobby as there is no way to make money from it right now, I understand that. But because of this, I have lost all passion or motivation to do any uni work. I have sat down and stared at my computer for hours on end with no result. I have already missed one assignment due date last week, and now I have another assignment that was due 3 days ago that I still have not completed.

Yesterday was extremely stressful day for me and my pack of friends. When I was at work my friend called me and asked if I knew where friend X (suicidal one, 21M) works and if I have contact with him. 
Unfortunately I only knew the field in which he worked since it was his new job. 

Apparently he sent his girlfriend an email, basically a suicide letter with his photo and a goodbye. He said that he is going to kill himself and he's sending it to her since   she was the only one keeping him from doing so and that he wishes he could believe there was another way but he doesn't. He said that he thinks he owes her this message and a photo although wishes she won't see it. He then states that he'll block her everywhere so she doesn't stop him. 

Long story short, his parents managed to contact him and met him in some hotel near the airport (no idea why he was there) and picked him up. Weird thing is that he acts on our group chats like nothing happened. Sharing memes, collecting money for a present for one our firends all that stuff. 

We have absolutely no idea what to do. He seems to be unaware that his girlfriend obviously moved heaven and earth to find him (which obviously means contacting his closest friends, us) so we know most of the story. 
How do we proceed, what do we do to help him? 
We don't want to scare him off so right now we pretend like we don't know anything.

Am I the only one who's felt this way after taking meds?

I have a theory: Bipolar disorder and some schizoaffective disorder stuff develops in late teens or early twenties, right? So now that I'm on Latuda, it makes sense that I would feel more like I did in my twenties when the symptoms weren't so bad.

I have anxiety and depression and he has an anti social personality disorder. 

The past few days I've had a lot of appointments and I've been feeling overwhelmed and I went over and he said a girls coming up for sex. I said that's fine, when will I get you next? He said tomorrow. I was like yeah okay cool. But I felt quite low and wanted to chill. 

I don't have romantic feelings for him. I'm not his girlfriend nor do I want to be. Sleeping with other people is fine. 

Later that night he texts asking for a threesome, I say not now I'm having a mentally bad time. He persists asking, saying this girls up for it. 

I eventually turn round and say to him, I don't think she's attractive, she's 10 years older than me (only 5 older than him) and I'm not game. Keeps persisting. I say no. 

Anyway today I'm looking forward to chilling without people and seeing him. 
He say that she's up and that I can come but she's still about. After the situation last night being in that environment would make me feel pressured into maybe doing it? I say that I'm upset about it and I was looking for to it.

146,"Okay get in for a ride because this is the first time im telling my  story. First off sorry for any grammar/language mistakes since English isn't my first language.


It all started about 3 years ago, out of the blue I became depressed, anxious and paranoid and I couldn't find a connection to why that was happening. Everything was going well for me, I was an (almost) straight A student, had a beautiful gf who I still think about from time to time. One day (idk why) I just broke up with her and told her i didn't like her anymore, which was total bs. From there on it all spiraled out of control, I started smoking (cigarettes ), drinking alone whenever i had the chance and once got alcohol poisoning and almost died, taking every pill i could find and not caring would it mix well with other pills I took with it. My grades went from A's to F's, I was getting in tons of trouble in school and out of school. I think for a almost a year straight I hoped every night that I wouldn't wake up tummorow, spent many sleepless nights cutting and crying. One day I'd had enough and decided to end it, before this I was severely suicidal but too much of a pussy to go through with it, anyway I took about 20 zolofts and some xanaxes (prescribed by my therapist who really didn't help and told me I was just over-exaggerating ) and went to sleep. Woke up about 3/4 hours later with the most intense pain in my stomach I've ever felt and the urge to shit and vomit. When I somehow managed to get to the toilet (everything was spinning and distorted ) I shat some blood and vomited then my parents found me.


It had started to get better, I was kinda happier and the episodes were much less frequent. Let's say I did okay in school since I managed to pass with decent grades and had an amazing summer. I cut down on cigarettes and completely on alcohol and haven't touched a pill since my attempt. I started smoking weed and it made me feel so much better, I was laughing, joking, just generally being happy (not only when I was high, I maybe smoked a few times each week and it helped tremendously ). I thought it was all over and that I could start paving a good path in life, but oh surprise suprise of course it fucking wasnt.


I was still ""stable"" until recently, I started getting random outbursts of extreme anger caused by nothing most of the time but the littlest things would make me go berserk, existential crisis, doubting my self worth, I failed a grade and I'm repeating it atm which is putting immense pressure on me because if I fail it again I lose the right to public schooling, started smoking way more than before (both weed and cigarettes ), lost about 20kg, Im constantly worrying about something or being angry for no reason (when i started typing this I was kinda calm but now for whatever reason I'm fuming and on the verge of tears), have homicidal and suicidal thoughts but thank god I'd never go through with them but I'm scared that if I snap that I'll do something irreparable, at the same time I love and hate my friends and I don't know why because they've been so nice to me, I've become desensitized to almost everything. I could go on and on with this list but it's just too overwhelming, im sorry. 


I don't show my emotions anymore to anyone, I'm just cruising trough life and bottling up my feelings, everyone around me thinks im this happy, chill jokester. This is the first time i told anyone about whats been happening recently (thanks reddit, it actually helped). 


This is getting too long and I could go on for much more, but I'm gonna end it here, thanks for the read and if you have any advice that would be helpful. ‚úåÔ∏è",18Sep2019,1

That my carefree attitude was because I didn't care about what people thought about me and that I'm outspoken because I feel like my opinion matters. But I've come to the realization that I do this all to shape my public image. I'm carefree because I'm pretending not to give a fuck when my last nightmare was about people in my class (A-level class) telling me to shut up because they didn't want to hear whatever I was saying. I'm outspoken because I feel like I constantly have to let people how I know about something so that they know what I stand for and if I'm with or against them. It's not because I think I'm important, it's because I hope other people think I'm intelligent and a bad ass or something.

I've spent so hard pretending to be someone who doesn't give a shit but I get so distressed in my mind every time I can't guess what someone is thinking about me.

I don't know what to do and I feel like I've cheated myself. I pretend I'm confident in myself but I'm not. I'm just good at manipulating my own image...so much that I had fooled myself into a false sense of confidence.

150,"I have been diagnosed with a plethora of mental health conditions over the last 30 years.

After trying most therapies, medicine and CAM treatments (all CAM treatments were useless in my case), an excellent doctor found the root cause of my problems and I am feeling better than I have in many years. The recovery will be long and I have permanent nerve damage at this stage.

This medical course linked below details physical conditions that cause mental health symptoms. I found it very useful.
Please check all possible physical causes before resorting to other treatments.

My particular situation was a combination of 4 autoimmune diseases.

 Celiac Disease (properly diagnosed, I don't just think I have a gluten intolerance)

 Adrenal disorder (causing thyroid fluctuations that couldn't be properly treated as I wasn't absorbing the medicine)
I was in Mydexia Crisis or coma. 

Also pernicious anemia an autoimmune disease that is caused by a missing enzyme that is necessary for  your body to absorb B's 
And Lupus

I had/have severe symptoms including hallucinations. I was aware that they were not real but still saw them. Severe depression, anxiety, bi-polar symptoms and diagnosis.. I could continue.
 Due to lack of proper treatment, I will never be who I could have been since my brain and body are damaged from so many years of improper diagnosis and treatment.

Here is the course (all the information is there no need to pay for the course)

And then she starts talking about how she thinks it‚Äôs a worm inside her stomach (I thought she was joking) and she said she could feel it move. And then she said she distanced herself because she‚Äôs afraid that if I found out about it they are gonna come after me. 
Who is they ? I don‚Äôt know either.

She‚Äôs been having a lot of anxiety and has been crying without reason. She keeps telling me to stay safe and watch my food and what things change around me. 
She‚Äôs always talking about how afraid she is that they‚Äôre gonna come after me. She feels like she‚Äôs being watched all the time, and that the virus is inside her hiding.

I experienced 2 mental breakdowns in my early 20s as mentioned in the title...this happened during a summer before 2nd year of college, I was going through anxiety all my life...Didnt even know what anxiety was until I experienced the 1st mental breakdown. Before I had my 1st mental breakdown I began smoking weed on a regular basis...and that had increased in frequency as time progressed, I found it helped but in turn I can admit that it caused the 1st mental breakdown.

After being hospitalized, I came back to normal luckily after 2 weeks..... unfortunately I went straight back to weed, I was completely indenial at the time that it was cause of it...so I continued smoking weed, didnt bother with the medication, and took a year off college....then bang it happened again a year later, I really learned the hard way, I experienced another mental breakdown and it took 8 weeks to recover in the hospital this time.

So once I had luckily returned to somewhat normal state, I then returned to college a year later and earned first class honours in physics.

Returning to college was the best thing I ever did...I made alot of friends, loved the subjects I was studying,i felt in control of my life again

I stayed off all kinds of drugs, kept smoking cigarettes like a chimney but once step at a time right?

I started taking my medication after my mental breakdown, abilify maintena injection and serquel to help me sleep at night.

I started working a year ago with an engineering company at 29 years of age...met a beautiful girlfriend and with her since then and its been going Amazing

The only problem im experiencing is the working part of my life....I constantly feel not good enough for the job, imposter syndrome, social anxiety around work mates...cant just be myself in work, always double checking everything I do...just constantly experiencing anxiety....its affecting my concentration at work...

For example today I had to walk into a different building and speaking to different people about a certain work related thing.....I began SWEATING from my forehead.... people were trying to talk to me but I just wanted escape back to my desk


Basically Im feeling incredible anxiety when at work.....I feel like I cant enjoy anything in the evening....I can however meet up with friends and girlfriend and I tend to forget about work, so thats a positive.

Surely though? Is work supposed to feel like this? Can I make money and be somewhat happy? Ive spoken to doctors and they make me feel like its normal?

Maybe college was this fantasy land of happiness and work is reality


But then again..why is it everyone at the lunch table can laugh and smile....while im sitting at the corner of the table waiting for lunch break to end

Maybe this is all Making no sense....never was a good writer.

I just feel trapped....my job is at a stressful point....I like the money but its Killing me. I need the job for my car...my home and my relationships with friends and girlfriend)

159,"This is long so bare with me. So a few months ago I was in a shooting. I was in a grocery store with my family and friend when gunshots went off about 15ft away, just around the corner. The first one, I thought was a balloon but then I thought,‚Äù Hey they don‚Äôt have balloons here.‚Äù I realized by the 2nd shot it was a gun. There were more and people started screaming. My mom grabbed me, my sibling and friend and told us to get down. People started running towards the emergency exit so i got up and ran too. The door was locked and wouldn‚Äôt open and that‚Äôs when i felt like we were going to die. My mom grabbed us and pulled us way from the mass target of people at the door that I was running towards and had us climb between  huge crates and a wall, out of sight. I was panicking and cussing, truly believing we were gonna get shot.  Finally the emergency door was busted open and we got up and ran out. When we were out my mom told us to stay hidden, stay together and keep running. We ran until we got down here safe and stayed behind cars until we knew where the threat was. At this point cops were coming, there was a helicopter on its way and I was hyperventilating and crying. Anyways, when we got home my friend said she heard me talking in my sleep begging the shooter not to shoot me. Weird. It turned out there was a domestic dispute and an off duty cop had the dumbass idea to pull a gun on the guy he was arguing with and and shot and killed him. Then he shot and injured the guys parents. When i found this out, I relaxed. It wasn‚Äôt a mass shooting. I was never going to die. I was ok. My friend was sent to therapy by her parents and still insist I have PTSD. Sometimes i panic and freeze up, like when a car backfires or fireworks suddenly go off. Sometimes when I realize i‚Äôm ok, I have to go somewhere and just breathe and one time I even cried because I thought it was a shooter. But i think this is normal and i‚Äôll get over it. People with PTSD have it wayyy worse. I feel like most people on are on edge of a shooting these days anyways. It‚Äôs terrible that a man was killed and the fact that he was killed while i was right there is haunting. But it wasn‚Äôt a mass shooter so i really think i‚Äôm fine.

161,"Really fuckin long rant:

There was this like I read in a book. 
Lucky in cards or Lucky in life. RNG weeks excellently for me in games, but life feels like a Trainwreck.

It feels like every person I get attached to is like, open up, be vulnerable. Be yourself. But when I do, they get clear of me like I'm trash.

So, the first girl I loved, I was stupid and crazy. So I was too clingy, and it didn't work out. So, I'm like, okay, I'll be better. It took me 5 years to get over all the hurt, but I did.

The second girl I loved, I was guarded. I was hesitant to open up. As much as she tried, and as much as she actually cared, I was too scared. Now the first girl had left me with the parting gift of ""You are not worth being loved"", and I carry it around everyday, all the time. And those words are powerful enough that I didn't believe when I was told that I was loved. She left, and feel in love with someone better. And she was kind to me, and somehow, it hurt me even more.

So, I decided I needed to be casual dating. I couldn't bear to be in love again. So, I get in touch with this girl, she seems funny, we seem to be able to talk, and it's good. And after a very long time, I'm happy. So, just as I'm about to ask her out, I learn that she has a boyfriend. At this point, it's so common for people I like to already be in a relationship that I didn't even curse my luck. I just said to myself... At what point will I finally be able to make peace with being alone.

But, I'm a person of ethos. So, I say, hey, I can still be friends with this girl. And, so I try my best to be a normal friend. But I lied to get about not being interested in her at all. So I just write her a long text telling her that I liked her, and when I learners she was committed, I backed off and that caused weirdness. Well, soon after she tells me she broke up with her boyfriend. I'm too jaded to take even any evil happiness in this. So I try and sympathise. But, in any case, I've been burned way too many times. So whenever I ask her for something, I leave an out for her, so that she doesn't have to do anything. She takes that as a bit of a slight. But later she clarifies there can never be in a relationship with me. That hits hard, but ok.

Then she asks me why I talk to her. Or why I like talking to her. I don't really have an answer to that question, And then she just says we should stop. Stop talking. So I ask her why. And she says she doesn't want to talk to me. And she's just done.

I'm sick of being that person who can be thrown away without much thought. I'm sick of being the person who somehow still finds it hard to do that. And most of all, I'm sick of making the same mistake over and over and over again. 

I don't know if there's any advice to be given here. But I just want to not care about being alone. The internet send filled with these people who say they enjoy being alone completely, all the time, and I want to be them. I want to not care.

165,"**Introduction**

Do you often feel anxious, or do you know someone else who is? Read on to find about more about what it is it, and learn a number strategies to help prevent it, or reduce the severity of the symptoms if you have it.

Anxiety is a common mental health problem, which is prevalent throughout the world and can be really serious in some cases. Studies show that more than 1 in 10 people will develop a disabling anxiety disorder at some stage in their life.

Anxiety is usually assessed on a degree of severity, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe.

There are a number of different anxiety disorders, which include:¬†generalized anxiety disorder,¬†phobias,¬†social anxiety disorder,¬†separation anxiety disorder,¬†agoraphobia,¬†panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and¬†selective mutism.

&amp;#x200B;

**Symptoms**

The symptoms associated with anxiety are quite varied, and can range from quite mild or to quite severe.

**1)** **Behavioural** \- social withdrawal, sleeping problems, loss of appetite, increased motor tension.

**2)** **Emotional** \- feelings of dread, trouble concentrating, feeling tense or jumpy, anticipating the worst, irritability, restlessness, blank mind, nightmares, obsessions about sensations, sense of 'deja vu', feeling trapped in your mind.

**3) Cognitive** \- thoughts about suspected dangers, such as fear of dying, believing that chest pains are heart attack, believing shooting pains in your head are a tumor or aneurysm, feeling an intense fear when you think of dying, or you may think of it more often than normal, or can't get it out of your mind.

**4) Physiological** \- headaches, vertigo, digestive problems, nausea, shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cause**

The risk factors associated with anxiety include:

**1) Neuroanatomical** \- Neural circuitry involving the amygdala (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the HPA Axis and sympathetic nervous system) and hippocampus (which is implicated in emotional memory along with the amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala.

**2)** **Genetics** \- Genetics and family history may put an individual at increased risk of an anxiety disorder, but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation.

**3) Medical** **conditions** \- Many medical conditions can cause anxiety. This includes conditions that affect the ability to breathe, like COPD and asthma, and the difficulty in breathing that often occurs near death. Conditions that cause abdominal pain or chest pain can cause anxiety and may in some cases be a somatization of anxiety.

**4) Substance-induced** \- Several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, withdrawal or from chronic use. These include¬†alcohol,¬†tobacco,¬†cannabis,¬†sedatives¬†(including prescription¬†benzodiazepines),¬†opioids¬†(including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin),¬†stimulants¬†(such as¬†caffeine,¬†cocaine¬†and amphetamines),¬†hallucinogens, and¬†inhalants.

**5) Psychological** \- Poor¬†coping skills¬†(e.g., rigidity/inflexible problem solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme self-expectation, negative thoughts, affective instability, and inability to focus on problems) are associated with anxiety. Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person's own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity.¬†Temperament (e.g.,¬†neuroticism)¬†and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) have been found to be risk factors for anxiety.

**6) Social** \- Social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma (e.g., physical, sexual or emotional abuse or assault), early life experiences and parenting factors (e.g., rejection, lack of warmth, high hostility, harsh discipline, high parental¬†negative affect, anxious childrearing, modelling of dysfunctional and drug-abusing behaviour, discouragement of emotions, poor socialization, poor attachment, and child abuse and neglect), cultural factors (e.g., stoic families/cultures, persecuted minorities including the disabled), and socioeconomics (e.g., uneducated, unemployed, impoverished although developed countries have higher rates of anxiety disorders than developing countries).

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 1: Mindfulness**

Mindfulness is a psychological process, which involves bringing one‚Äôs attention to what you are experiencing in the present moment, which can be developed through the practice of meditation.

To perform mindfulness you must adopt a particular orientation toward one‚Äôs experiences in the present moment, which is characterised by a mixture of acceptance, curiosity, and openness.

Mindfulness practice has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, stress, anxiety, and can is also used to treat drug addiction.

**1) Awareness** \- Notice the thoughts which arise in your mind, and the sensations that feel in your body. Do they feel hot or cold? Notice your heart beat. Be aware of your breathing. Allow yourself to feel these sensations without resistance

**2) Acceptance -** Rather than accept or reject your thoughts, try to just observe them without judgement and allow them to flow in and out of your mind.

**3) Present Moment** \- We often worry about the future or dwell on the past, but you should learn to focus on the present moment, and bring your attention back to what is happening in the now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 2: Breathing**

Square breathing is a simple technique which involves taking slow, deep breaths. It is good for stress reduction, and can increase performance and concentration.

To start, visualise a square, then follow the instructions going clockwise:

**1)** Breathe in for 4 seconds picturing one side of the square.

**2)** Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the second side of the square.

**3)** Breathe out over 4 seconds visualising the third side of the square.

**4)** Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the fourth side of the square.

This exercise should be completed as many times as required for the breathing to become calm and regular.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 3: Other Ideas**

**1)** **Keep** **a** **journal** \- Write down your current thoughts, and brainstorm possible solutions to your problems.

**2) Reading** \- Read one of your favourite books, or shop around for a new self-help book.

**3)** **Write a poem** \- Turn your current worries and problems into a poem to give meaning to them.

**4) Colouring** \- Get some coloured pencils, or crayons, and draw whatever comes to mind. Try some random patterns, or if you are feeling more adventurous create a stunning piece of art.

**5)** **Music** \- Listen to your favourite band, or play your instrument if you have one.

**6)** **Dance** \- Move your body to your favourite song, to help keep fit and distract yourself at the same time.

**7)** **Walk** \- Take a walk outside and, and pay attention to your surroundings. Count houses, cars or trees as you pass them.

**8) Relaxation** \- Take a warm, relaxing bubble bath or a warm shower, which ever you prefer.

**9)** **List** \- Write a list of positive things in your life, such as good memories and your best attributes, and read them whenever you feel bad.

**10)** **Triggers** \- Make a list of your triggers, and give it to your therapist if you have one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quotes**

To end this post, here‚Äôs a few of my favourite quotes related to anxiety:

&gt;‚ÄúThe root of all suffering is attachment.‚Äù \~ Buddha  
‚ÄúFear is excitement without the breath.‚Äù \~ Fritz Perls  
‚ÄúYou can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.‚Äù \~ Jon Kabat-Zinn  
‚ÄúLife isn't about waiting for the storm to pass; it's about learning to dance in the rain.‚Äù \~ Vivian Greene  
‚ÄúAccept - then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it.‚Äù \~ Eckhart Tolle",18Sep2019,1

In every video or post about reddit i've seen, people were pretty kind and helpful to each other so im giving it a try.

i am new here and I registered for this post only! Let me introduce myself a little:

* i am between 18-21 so im pretty young
* i was lightly (not much but enough to leave a mark on me) bullied in school
* i dont really like people
* i dont really like myself
* never went to a doctor/psychologist but i think i might have a few screws loose
* i am from somewhere in europe
* i'm an introvert
* i'm antisocial
* i see a big chance that i might be a sociopath (a few sociopath tendencies at least)

i got into this giant loop when i was about 13-15 and im still in it and cant escape in a nutshell; i was already heavily introvert and got my first like real big crush on a girl, yeah that was also my first rejection and i actually took it better than expected but it actually released almost a decade of rage and sadness in me and it fucked me up pretty badly afterwards.

i was somewhat normal. My parents loved me when i got good grades and meant 0 problem for them. My dad was never really the tipical dad. He was always working and even if he was home he didnt really show any emotions and stuff like that (boo hoo the spoiled failure crying about his dad at least he had one(i got that too many times so if u feel like it just copy paste it to the comments)) and my mom was umm... a little bit ""short-tempered"" (i can basically ninja walk everywhere so i dont wake her up or annoy her) like she could throw a full blown shit show for me spilling a cup of milk after school at the age of 6. (boo FUCKING hoo again the parenst) so yeah.

my parents are pretty wealthy (at least where we live) and given that everybody always thought that everything is perfect and im a spoiled dickhead if i had any bad things in my life (thats part is to avoid the  ""WhY dIdNt U tAlK tO sOmEoNe?!"" comments) either that or they just hated me for this (mostly teachers and a few kids)

this is the last and almost the worst story from the past and then i will ask my question (sorry again that i write so much shit i just wanted to get it out of me) okay so long story short my parents were invited to a party (xmas or new years or some other shit i dont really know it was more than 8 years) and i got mad because they just dropped me off at my granny's house and wanted to leave for the night. i was just a fucking kid who wanted some time with his parenst during the holidays and i got stubborn saying that i want them to stay etc. -&gt; i made a shitshow -&gt; we went home -&gt;mom showed us what a real shit show is. Mom was in her early 30's so she just wanted some last parties ( thinking back I was pretty stupid and should have let them go) and she said some very harsh stuff to me and went to their room -&gt; i started crying and thought that they hate me -&gt; dad got protective and bitchslapped my mom so bad it left a mark on the wall.

OKAY skip forward 2 weeks they are not talking like wtf 

SKIP another month dad is taking me to places to be like father and son YAY yeah well no he is talking about what a divorce is

AFTER MORE THAN HALF A YEAR of everyday fights and shouting and sending my brother to my room to ""play"" (so he dont have to hear the shitshow) they start talking again. i was like 9 at the time. In the next 7.5 years every single fight or  just a little voice lift or just a bad word between them caused me a massive panic attack (breathink problems, crying hysterically etc.) because i thought that this fight is because of me AGAIN. then i got old enough for the truth; drumroll please! dad fucked some bitch and mom found it out a few days after the party fight.

I am seriously thinking about fucking off and just vanishing. They are now a bit more helpful and since im a big boi and got pretty strong there is no more abusive shit (it was my mom most of the time or my dad manipulated by my mom) i basically told them that if anyone hits me again im sending them to the hospital and idc about FaMiLy and shit. I am starting to learn a new career (IT and coding was made for me if i have the brain for it) but i dont know i kinda like them and my little sis is the only person i care about. Seriously i dont really care about others i have a few friends if i can even call them friends. Never really had any ""best friends"" everytime i had one they always left me in shit so yeah there is nothing in this place for me except for my lil dickhead in the next room. 

**I am in need of some sort of help. I dont know what questions to ask so the only one that i can think about is WHAT SHOULD I DO?**

I did not write an essay to pity or to make anyone think that ""poor baby how sad"" or some shit. I'm actually glad that things went like this. I don't have a lot feelings anymore. They made me tough and i am fine. My only problem is my sis she is 13 i cant just leave her but if i stay i might do some ""messed up stuff"" out of boredom. So yeah what would you do in my situation? (No, suicide is not available i went trough it years ago)

Yeah ik i dont know how to finish these things up, i just wanted to say: Thank you for reading and if you answer you might save my ass right now so thank you again.

TL;DR: Richboi with ""perfect on the inside unprepared for a kid on the inside"" family got messed up in the head and now cant decide to leave the only person he loves (little sister so not romantical shit \[insert alabama meme please\]) behind and start over or what to do",18Sep2019,1
167,"I‚Äôve started to notice when it comes to my opinion it‚Äôs always influenced by other people, like If I think something‚Äôs wrong but I see people commenting it‚Äôs right, I then think oh yeah that‚Äôs right. I‚Äôve noticed it a lot recently. I used to like different music but I met my boyfriend and now I listen to his type of music and many more things.

168,"I guess the title says it all but I can still go on and elaborate.
Recently I have often been super off (as in genuinely dissociating) and have been showing depressive symptoms (though it is more of an episode). I keep bouncing between the two extremes of being 1. driveless and far from feeling real and 2. violent and strong autoagressive urges (though I don‚Äôt act on them, I have years of experience with coping with these). I have been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety and depression, though my therapist recently agreed this is not prevalent right now.
I have been considering building up to something that might end bad for me but stems from a good deed for way more people than just ridiculous little me and if I get arrested kill myself. I would at least change something.
It‚Äôs completely absurd how much we as humans depend on something like a purpose.. Yet it‚Äôs the only thing that makes sense right now.
I‚Äôve been working a lot. Right now I‚Äôm on holidays (still at home but not working) and it sort of makes me feel aimless. All semester I‚Äôve been super busy (developing a video game and filming a short film and taking several difficult and work-intense classes, having a job on the side and doing an internship). It was at the point where I got from 1-3 hours od sleep a night every night until the day I physically broke down shaking and twitching. I was working day and night and it was incredibly exhausting, but I have to admit it did keep my bad thoughts from me as all I had to do was to function.
I don‚Äôt know what to do

TLDR: if it really was too long for you then maybe just focus on something that‚Äôs more important to you and forget about this post",18Sep2019,1

I'm bitter that almost half of the money that I should have inherited will go to the government's pocket. I'm bitter 


I'm bitter that people can afford to eat well enough to become fat - meanwhile, I can't even put a pound of weight on.


I'm bitter that my social anxiety stops me from telling people how I really feel about them.


I'm bitter that I have had no control over any of the shit that's been thrown at me. I don't deserve this shit.

177,"Hi all,
New to reddit. A friend recommended it for some advice as it seemed to help them a little reaching out to like-minded individuals. 

I‚Äôm not sure how to really start this. I guess I‚Äôll just sort of ramble. I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist since I was about 13. My parents had a pretty gnarly divorce and the time and I lost both of my grandparents to cancer in the middle of the divorce. It‚Äôs sad that I think of myself as my mother‚Äôs own mother and that I never really had a mother figure of my own. I think as someone who was adopted and doesn‚Äôt know their biological parents, losing another parent figuratively was pretty intense on me as a kid. 

Anyways, I‚Äôve been seeing psychiatrists over the years as well and I always have this feeling of being ‚Äústuck‚Äù as I call it because I can‚Äôt describe it any better than that. I have a hard time connecting with people and I don‚Äôt understand how to fix it. I have terrible social anxiety from what I went thru in elementary but I‚Äôm pretty good in public now, a lot of decent friends but - I don‚Äôt hang out with people most days. I‚Äôm usually more comfortable at home and will come up with an excuse as to why I can‚Äôt hang out with a friend that day. My relationships have really suffered too. I was dating someone back in December for about half a year and they ended up breaking things off because I could barely even touch him half the time. And he was an incredible man! So sweet, kind and understanding. 

I did end up trying to take my life a year ago today but I‚Äôve grown quite a lot since then with my mental health.

I guess I‚Äôm just curious is anyone like this? Maybe I need to still heal from something? I don‚Äôt want to be stuck forever - anything helps.",18Sep2019,1
