0,"I don't really know if this is the right place to post or ask for advice. 

Consistent weight loss isn't something I've ever had to deal with so it's really hard for me to understand what's actually going on with her. She's a pretty small girl as it is but I've known her since high school and she's never been this small. Her mental health is a bit all over the place this past few weeks due to a crazy work schedule and she's always been a stress head with bad anxiety and physical health issues although her weight has been fluctuating between healthy and underweight for the past ~2 years. I do my best in terms of giving her space to breathe and enjoy her downtime when she's not working but I feel like that's as far as I'm capable of going with helping her get through her issues. 

Has anyone had any experiences with something of this sort? I'm getting more worried about her everyday and its painful to watch someone struggle with this.",21Aug2019,1
1,"After not going to session due to insurance I finally went back to my psychiatrist. We were talking I told her that I get the impulse to cut my self with out a trigger.  The look on her face when I told her I knew something was wrong. She asked me if anyone was bipolar in my family, and said that this could be a sign of it. So I need to have my family watch my emotions. 

Enough of that so my question. So me and my husbands relationships went really quick. I was so into him, saw him everyday it was perfect. Well he was quick on his feet and proposed after a month. I was a great idea I loved him so much so of course I said yes. Then things kinda dropped off I was depressed, got on lexapro first 10mg then 20mg had to stop because it made me want to kill myself. Fighting with my SO Then when it came to plan the wedding i had up and downs from being happy and fighting with my SO.",21Aug2019,1
2,"Last night he was in a bad state. He lives far away so I can’t visit. I managed to get him to call a local suicide support line and he felt ok after. Still depressed but not wanting to kill himself.          

He said he would call me late in the night if he is close to doing it.        

My question is, at what point do I call the police? My fear is, if I call them, I break the trust and he won’t talk to me when he is feeling bad.         

I don’t really know what else I want To ask but I feel like there is a question I should be asking for help on with him but don’t know what it is. Guess I’m hoping someone knows what question I should be asking and give me an answer on.",21Aug2019,1
3,"Five days ago I started taking Prozac, prescribed by my doctor to treat my severe anxiety. So far in the initial period of taking it, as I’ve experienced with every new meds I’ve tried, it’s made the things it’s meant to treat worse. My levels of anxiety and depression (I don’t suffer from depression normally, but since Prozac is used to treat depression I guess it makes sense that I’m feeling this way) have definitely increased. 

So I’m wondering, based on other people’s experiences, how long it takes for things to stop getting worse and start getting better on Prozac?",21Aug2019,1

I know they are made up and just a myth but it starts to freak me out, I’m not very old and I do have anxiety but not very serious, I worry about things I say or do that might be rude and stuff like that, I really need help, so if you have any ideas please say?",21Aug2019,1
5,"lately i've been feeling increasingly lost mentally, both literally and metaphorically. i don't know whats causing it really and i don't know what to do about it as i've never spoken to any kind of doctor about it. especially in the morning as soon as i wake up i am extremely confused, disorientated, this can last severely for 5-10 mins (of what i can consciously identify as being awake) and the mental foggyness often lasts through the day. sometimes when i wake up i start talking out to 'people' which i see in my room who aren't actually there. thankfully they're mostly people i know but i still talk out loud and have interactions with therm as if they're there sitting on the ground. when i realise what's happening i get frustrated and the confusion spirals to the point at which i break down, leading to cutting as it has so far been my only working method of trying to get somewhat control over this rush of i don't know how to describe it. its like as soon as you wake up a million things hit you at once and they're all upsetting or frustrating to you. i should also note 2 things. when trying to get to sleep i often wake myself up from what others have described as twitching even when i am not in a dream, leading me to wake up, sometimes panicked as i don't know whats going on. also that almost every night i'll have dreams, balanced between good ish to nightmares/distorting/ones that make no sense (although which dreams ever do!) sometimes ill wake up in the middle of the night sweating and heavily breathing and immediately cry and curl up into a ball. i feel i have nobody to talk to about this and the one person i have told didn't seem much to be interested or understand, leading me to be afraid to tell others. i've tried doing some research and have been provided with a multitude of different conclusions but i still fear that i'm too deep into my own head and its all in my imagination. its starting to now get to the point where i am afraid to sleep because i know that waking up will create so much mental turmoil which has been happening every day for the last month or so and was happening a few times a week for the around 6 months before that. only having experienced these kind of things a new times further back into my history. though as a child i did have lots of nightmares which would wake me and send me into this sort of state, but they wouldn't trigger quite such a strong and mentally frustrating response, leading me to feel increasingly lonely and like i'm trapped in my head, leading me to be more panicked, developing an ever growing mass of self hatred and wanting to kill myself as a way to escape

just anyone who can share advice/experiences would be nice, just so i don't feel as alone in this",21Aug2019,1
6,"First of all, I am not writing this to get people to feel sorry for me, I am making this post because I want some new solutions on how to deal with this. So I moved to Florida in late 2009 when I was 15, it was a great opportunity to live near the beach and have a fresh start for my family and a good place for me to start high school. I started at a high school that only had about 500 people in it so everyone knew each other and had connections. I tried my hardest to be social and make friends but I was pretty shy. I have red hair and pale skin and kids can be cruel so I became a target. It started when someone made up a rumor about me about a month into my freshman year of high school and it spread like wildfire in this small school. Almost half of the school made fun of me, called me names, socially rejected me, threatened to physically harm me, laughed at me when I got upset and different people found different reasons to make fun of me and it was happening on a daily basis. I went to the principal to try and discuss what was happening but they could not do much about the half the school not liking me. My parents did not believe that I was being bullied and targeted even though I would come home and cry and would be extremely depressed. I did not know what it was like to have friends or to be treated like a normal human being by my peers. I thought I was destined to live like this for the rest of my life. When I would see people outside of school, I would be petrified and I would try my very hardest to avoid them, despite all of this, they would drive by and make fun of me outside of school if I was on a walk or use a truck microphone to call me names from their car while I was with my mom. They would also cyberbully me on facebook or create fake accounts with my picture on it. After freshman year, it died down a bit but then ramped back up and I again begged my mom to let me transfer schools and halfway through sophomore year, my mom took me out of the school and I transferred to a much bigger high school that was an hour away from me. I did not have these issues at my new high school and actually started making friends and dated a few girls while I was there and I ended up graduating high school without incident. However, the damage was already done. I developed severe anxiety and had my first serious panic attack when I was 17 and I started being afraid of my surroundings. I would always be vigilant to see if the people who bullied me and threatened me were in public places such as restaurants, stores, and the mall. I would be hesitant to try and make friends because I was socially rejected by my peers and I thought everyone would treat me like that. About 3 years ago, I was home from college and working and one night, as I was leaving, one of the people who bullied me initially seemed friendly but mentioned the rumor that people made up about me and laughed at me and drove off. Now im graduated from college and working on getting a job but I still have severe anxiety that has taken over almost every aspect of my life. I will say that I have had a few of the people who bullied me apologize for the way they treated me but some have just not let it go, which is surprising. I was on facebook and commented on a post and one of the people who bullied me also commented and tagged someone else who also bullied me. My heart sunk when I saw this and I immediately blocked both of them, this brought back alot of old trauma and I was petrified. I am not sure if I should move away in order to avoid them for good or if I should stay here and not let them get to me. I know now that this is not high school, we are adults and if they start harassing me, I can let the police know since harassment is a crime. I wish I knew a better way to deal with all of this because when I think about it, I feel so low as a person and it feels like others hate me. I freeze up and I cant stop thinking about when I was being threatened, laughed at and harassed on a daily basis.",21Aug2019,1
7,"Picked up some of that cannabis oil you drink online, I've done a lot of edibles but never tried this drinkable stuff.  I had a therapy session at 4:15 and figured if I took some around 12:30 I'd be sober around 2:30-3:00 and good to go.  I didn't even feel the effects for a solid hour and a half later and my high lasted wayyyy longer than I thought, I felt like I was sobering up near the end of the session which was like 5hrs after I'd taken it.   This stuff really doesn't make my eyes red at all so I figured fuck it I'll go anyways.

It was honestly great.  I went in really anxious but after we got to talking I was able to chill out and was so much more releaxed than normal.  Im a grown ass man and I cried multiple times and afterwards I felt so much better and like a weird sense of relief.  I got some stuff on my mind thats been bothering me for a while and I never had the courage to bring up.  I was actually able to answer most of her questions and followup questions when usually I don't have an answer to anything or I'm too afraid to say it.  

I really wanted to mention I was high and that it was helpful but she specifically said when we first started that she had nothing against cannabis use but didn't want me doing it if it interfered with sessions or I started showing up high (I mentioned I was going to work and school high a lot when my panic attacks and anxiety were bad).  I don't think I'll say anything but it really was a great experience",21Aug2019,2
8,"This has been my way to escape from the world. To be myself, and express my feelings. I’ve been going through a lot mentally this year. (But have suffered my whole life). Well today while talking to my brother he told me he stalked me on here. But that was after me getting it out of him, he had said he was told by someone I posted something on insta or FB about my mom, and about him. And I’ve never once complained on those social media platforms about anyone. I thought on here I was “invisible”. I didn’t know he even had an account. But I’m no longer feeling safe to be myself. 

Plus after the talk with him I just wanna slit my wrists. (But don’t worry y’all, I won’t, I’m with my partner so I’m in a safe place). But I have no family anymore. No parents. No siblings (I’m the youngest of 7) so it’s a pretty big. They think everything I’ve told them is a lie.  But that’s because non of them have mental health issues, so they don’t know how to deal with someone who does. 

The worst part, is I don’t know what my brothers account would be on here so I could block him.",21Aug2019,0
9,"Hey guys!

This is my very first reddit post, as I'm seeking to find someone else with the some issues I have going on and see what they were able to find for help.

I have a history of:
Mental illness; Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, OCD
Not making myself a priority (or even knowing what self-care to try)
Being sick (a lot of it due to not taking care of myself, I don't get enough sleep, I don't listen when my body tells me it needs a break, etc.)
And even having strange psycho-somatic illnesses.

I am fairly certain what is currently going on with me is also psycho-somatic.
I was being harrassed by someone I work with and it triggered my PTSD and Anxiety. The anxiety got worse and worse over this incident because it wasn't being dealt with appropriatly in an appropriate time frame. Then I started having 3 weeks of vomitting and diarhea, followed by 4 weeks (so far) of weakness, nausea, confusion, disorientation, forgetfulness, slowed reactions, etc. 

I was fighting so hard to just make it through the lastest disaster that I never listened to my body or mind telling me it needed a break.
What felt like all of a sudden (but was really slow coming as I ignored the signs), I was out of work (I work in retail and can't stand on my feet for more than about 30 minutes, let alone 8 hours. I'm disoriented and have to vomit and take a nap after a phone call or a doctors appointment, I can't make myself be the leader of the business for all things for 40 hours a week), can't drive (it feels like I would be doing the equivalent of a DUI), and terrified because I have no idea where to start!

I have also been diagnosed, in May, with a teeny tiny Micro- Pitutary Adenoma, a 2 mm tumour that sits on my pituitary gland, causing an issue with my hormones.

So I went to urgent care, they told me they couldn't do anything for me and to go to the ER
I went to the ER and they told me 1) I wasn't pregnant 2)I didnt have anything that would ""kill you before you can make it to a doctor on Monday"" and 3) checked for blockages, tears, etc in my stomach/ digestive track. 
Then I followed up with my PCP who ruled out Lyme, Mono, anything to do with my blood cell counts, any infections at all, ""anything we could treat"", everything else would have to go to a specialist. They recommended my Psychiatrist and the OBGYN I see who found the teeny tumour. 
The OBGYN laughed at me when I suggested coming in and told me that I would need to follow up with a Neurologist and an Endocronologist and not her.
The Psychiatrist was so awful (not relevant right now, but I won't be seeing her again) and told me that she couldnt do anything for me and sent me back to my PCP to get my disability paperwork taken care of, she told me I should never have been sent to her in the first place.  However, I wasn't asking for her to filll out disability paperwork (yes, I did need it, but I told her I was more concerned with finding out what was wrong with me than the disabilty paperwork).
Then when I went bacck tothe PCP, they told me to go bacck to a new PCP and also see a Neurologist and a GI Speclalist.

Now, I feel like it feels obvious at this point; given my mental health diagnoses, the trigger at work, the increase stress, the history of psycho-somatic illness, and the ruling out of anything else I can think of; that I am having a psycho-somatic illness. The digestive tract issues have almost entirely resolved since I've been out of work, only resurfacing again in the hours or day following a particularly stressful episode for me. 

I'm looking for help. Has anyone dealt with psycho-somatic illnesses? What were some things you did in your day to day life to get better? What types of things were helpful to you in work-related concerns? Disability paperwork? Therapists and psychiatrists? Anything at all would be great to help me know where to look next!

Thanks!",21Aug2019,1
10,"My problem isn't very dramatic, but it's been weighing down on me recently. My life is pretty good rn, in fact.

I find myself worrying a lot about things that are happening thousands of miles away. Right now, it hasn't really affected my day to day life, but it's caused me to feel quite down sometimes.

13,"So today I found out that one of my best friends had been sleeping with a girl that I had been seeing for some time. She has no idea that I know, and I couldn’t even tell her today that I knew because I just wanted to enjoy the brief time we had left. 


As a synopsis, my was friend lied to me on three occasions about what was going on and wouldn’t even come clean about it until after I cornered him about it and offered no alternative but to come clean. It wasn’t until then that he came forth and admitted to it all. It was then that he started the ole I feel bad shite to try and salvage our relationship because my connections get him a lot of additional access at work that he otherwise wouldn’t get. I’m not upset with her because I didn’t make my intentions know to her, but he specifically asked me about how I felt about her twice before pushing on.


I don’t really know what to do now. I feel so lost.",21Aug2019,1
14,"All my life I’ve felt different from other people. When I was younger I was quiet. I thought I was just a shy person person and I would grow out of it some day, but I never did. To this day I’d rather wander around a store trying to find what I need rather than ask someone for help. It doesn’t bother me... I just don’t want to interact with anybody. 

Making and keeping friends has always been really difficult for me. There were times when I thought I’d made a new friend only for them to never reach out to me ever again. I never understood what I’d done to make people dislike me so much. Relationships go much the same way. If I really like the guy it’ll be fine for a few weeks but then eventually I get tired of them. I just get tired having to be “on” all the time. It feels like I’m performing 24/7 and I feel like I lose all my freedom. I’m not that particularly in having sex with others... actually thought I was asexual for awhile, but now I don’t think so. I would even bother with relationships, but I do recognize that relationships (of all kinds) give you support and I feel like I really need it. I’ve never had much support. 

Working is hard. I feel like I never know what I’m doing, even if the task is simple. I had to leave a simple cashier job (at a college bookstore) because all the codes and processes I had to learn and memorize overwhelmed me. I also didn’t like having to deal with customers. Sometimes their questions confused me or even when there were no customers, I didn’t know what I was expected to be doing. All my coworkers just seemed to instinctively know. I didn’t get it. 

Speaking of which, that’s a big thing with me... I feel like everyone just knows things. Growing up my parents weren’t normal... they didn’t raise me the right way. I’m thankful I grew up with the internet (I’m 29) so I could google what I needed to know and ask questions because my parents never taught me anything. They never taught me basic life skills and because of that I feel like I’m way behind in everything... relationships, work, etc. I’d always see other families and get envious because mine was so different. I always felt alone and isolated. 

So in conclusion, I’m just wondering what all of this means or what it at least sounds like. I’m always anxious... have had panic attacks in the past, pretty sure I have an anxiety disorder. I know I’m depressed. I may have PTSD as well. I feel like there may be some kind of personality disorder in there as well though. Or maybe I’m on the spectrum... I just don’t know. I feel like my parents should’ve noticed something was wrong with me when I was much younger but like I said before, they just didn’t know what they were doing and I don’t think they cared. Not really hoping for much here... I don’t really expect much from people anymore :/",21Aug2019,2

17,"Some background before I get into what this post is about. Back in 2014 my papa died and I just completely lost it. I became so depressed and I started self-harming. I was committed several times for cutting and a couple times for suicide attempts. But this past year I was able to wean off of all my medications (anti-depressant, anxiety meds, and sleep meds). I am currently a year and a half clean from cutting. 

But here’s why I write. I have slowly felt myself become more and more depressed over time. Starting back in May. I was fixing to graduate and was being forced to move out so that was pretty depressing. Then about two and a half weeks ago my Grandma passed away. That has been the tip of the iceberg. I have delved very deep back into the dark abyss of depression. I don’t sleep, I cry all the time, I can’t seem to leave my bed and when I do it’s to lay on the couch. I am having strong urges to cut myself and have thought about it. 
I don’t know if any of y’all feel this way but I really want to die but I’m not going to kill myself. It’s just I’ve noticed I’m not being careful anymore. I don’t look when I cross the street, I don’t check the labels to see how much medicine I need to take... ETC.

My family is amazing and incredibly supportive, and I feel like an absolute leech. But it's not that I'm unmotivated or don't work hard: I study in a good university, and I'm really passionate about what I study (ironically, my studies revolve around the brain and cognition). Last year, I spent 14+ hours at school each day, studying, working in labs etc., and actually enjoyed it. I've experienced some traumatic events in the past (some were out of my control, some were caused by my own doing) that nearly jeopardized my education, and I have this crippling fear that I have or will do something wrong to ruin it all. At this point, I feel completely incapable of doing things that most people my age do seamlessly. I experience panic attacks and emotional breakdowns, I weep and wail when no one's around, and I just feel overcome with this stomach-churning dread.

When my journey with it first started, I tried various medications (Lexapro, an anxiety med I can’t remember the name of, and some others) and ended up using Celexa. I have been on Celexa for around 3.5 years and it has changed my life completely for the better. My anxiety is under control and my depression is basically nonexistent, with the occasional rainy day. Over the past year or so, however, I have noticed a complete lack of motivation in myself. I never want to do anything around the house like laundry or cooking. I have a job and I get my work done, but sometimes I put things off until the last minute. I am wanting to lose weight but I don’t want to go to the gym or eat healthy.

22,"here are two quotes from 2 different articles;

one is about a school shooter and the other about a suicide victim.

1. 'We had no clue. \[he\] was a happy kid. Yes, he was a moody teenager like most teenage boys are, but he didn't have any different symptoms or show any outward signs of depression and anxiety.'

2. ""'He was quiet, I would say 'hi how are you?' He would say 'fine'. He was a normal teenager, quiet, kept to himself.'""

Hard to tell which one is which? not good

is this how parents and adults view their kids? a normal boy is 'quiet' and 'moody'? Nope. 'normal' people are not like this all the time. the accepted response of a child saying 'fine' to everything question you ask him should not be ""oh thats how normal teenagers are hehe!"" Both of these children in the articles were impacted by their mental state to extreme levels at opposite ends of the spectrum. one's coping mechanism was hurting others, the other, himself, however both of these boy's state of mind was completely ignored by those around them, their slow deterioration being described as 'normal'. 

how in any world is this normal?

our perspective on what mental health in and how to approach the issues and legitimately heal the mind i believe are highly delusional.

you can't see a mental issue, you can't guess signs, its not as easy to approach as a physical wound and i think the perception of mental health problems is too shallow to truly appreciate that. one's mind is such a delicate and powerful mechanism and its immoral and wrong to disregard someone's mental struggles as normal or just 'being a teenager'. ik ive just mentioned teens as an example but this applies as well for adults with mental health issues. a large problem ive seen on the perspective of adult mental health seems to be the dismissal of the issue by the thinking that an adult should have everything figured out and those problems should be able to be 'solved' on their own.

anyway the broad concept i want to get across is that an injury of the mind is a deeply personal, internal process of the mind that cannot be stitched back together like a cut and the perception of what a 'mentally healthy' person cannot be a generalized.

a surgeon can do the same surgery 20 times the exact same way and have high percentage results. 

if a therapist treated each of their 20 patients the same i cant say i believe that would have a good impact.

these are just my thoughts that came up after seeing these 2 quotes and connecting them somehow, sorry if the writing is scattered but i hope i got all my ideas down. please feel free to share your opinions or let me know if im wrong.

25,"I'll start by saying, I know I need to go back to therapy, and today is a bad day. For anyone who cares to read about my mental health journey and offer advice on improvement, I'd love to hear your thoughts. (Burner account)

My childhood was up and down to say the least. I grew up with an alcoholic father who I trusted immensely and adored. He started drinking again when I was 10 after being sober throughout my early years. His drinking scarred me - verbal abuse and overall psychological abuse were extremely common, and 99% of the time we were 1-1 together because my parents split at 1. He was the most charming and charismatic person I had ever met (and still have ever met). He promised me many times that it was the last time he'd ever drink. I trusted that, and I think that was the last time I'd ever truly trusted anyone. A constant fear loomed over me wondering if he'd be drunk and abusive every time I spent time with him, which I couldn't evangelize to him or anyone else. At 13, I found him dead on the couch as a result of drinking himself to death. Was this the hardest day of my life, or was this the biggest relief of my life? I don't know how I was feeling and still don't. 

At the same time, I experienced frequent sexual abuse in my early childhood. I developed a sexual nature early on - I was curious, and my cousin used to take advantage of me, he is three years older than me. I hated admitting that I liked it which caused me to gravitate towards other older teenagers who would do the same thing until I was old enough to drive. Is this my fault for liking it? Or was I being taken advantage of? I can't even remember how it all started or why it started, but I don't think I initiated it. I also remember *something* happening as a child where I was sexually abused, but I can't pinpoint what it is or where it took place. Luckily I had a mom and step-dad who loved me. They had their own issues (mostly financially) but they supported me, listened, and cared. Without them I have no idea where I would be today.

Fast forward - I'm 26 years old now, and I've found a passion in my career, I'm lucky enough to have great friends and am following my dreams. But I met this girl recently who I care about more than anything for all the right reasons and it's freaking me out. At this age, I still can't trust anyone. I still can't be fully honest with anyone about myself, so I revert to my disguise, which is lying and exaggerating. The past few months I've truly enjoyed this relationship, and here I am again, doubting everything, feeling anxious, fighting off the urges to be controlling, and feeling unsatisfied. I have no idea what I really want because, like everything else, I've avoided thinking about it. I know this will end in flames as a result of my inability to have faith in steady long-term relationships and be monogamous. I work to please others and take on their burdens far more than I take on my own which makes me resent them in time. I lie about stupid things to look cool and I'm certain she'll find out in time, unless I give up on things before she has the chance to do so. 

All the signs point to me having PTSD, OCD, Anxiety, Attachment issues, or Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm ultimately searching for someone to tell me what I am so I can learn to fix it. Today is a bad day, but I'm taking it day by day and working to improve on all of my issues gracefully. Can anyone relate?",21Aug2019,1
26,"I read alot about people finally  speaking to a therapist.

And it makes me wonder how bad my mental health really is.

And why it's something I continue to do nothing about.

I've been dealing with issues up and down for years now . But being male have kept it to myself.

When I think back to the time I walked out to a forest in the middle of the night . I put myself in that situation not to do anything but to feel what that situation would be like as if it was a an eventual probability.

This was ages ago and I just kept on. Still for months to the past few years , get suicidal thoughts and have planned the whole thing more than once. I never act on it , and it's been a few years with this . But have still never spoke to a therapist.

The same things occurs with a keyboard and mouse, other then the base of my wrists and fingertips if the rest of my inner palm is touching the keyboard it feels uncomfortable and makes me feel stressed and I don't understand why or how.

31,"I recently witnessed something horrific. By witness I mean I did not actually see the event that happened but I did see a mother’s raw reaction as a police officer told her that her 18 year old son had died of a drug overdose. 

This all happened directly outside of my living room window.  I did not personally know the son but I did see him around on a daily basis so I knew of him. I had never seen his family. 

Out of pure coincidence, a Facebook friend of mine posted about this person’s death hours after it had happened.  Had he not posted this I never would have known his name or his age or anything about him really. I just would have known that he was a guy who was around a lot who happened to die. 

My issue is that I cannot stop thinking about it.  I can’t stop looking at his friends social media posts. I can’t stop looking at his girlfriend’s  posts (she was there when he died). 

The only time that I’m not thinking about it is when I’m at work and my mind is busy. 

I’ve had trouble sleeping since it happened because all I can picture is his family and friends grieving outside as they waited for the coroner. 

I feel weird about it. Everything feels eerie and I no longer like being home alone at night. I feel haunted in a way. I feel like I have no right to feel any way about this because I didn’t know him and I didn’t lose someone. But I can’t help it.    
 
The closest thing I can relate this to is an EMT or a police officer delivering news of a child’s tragic death to their parents.

34,"i come from a family that is familiar with mental illness. my father has depression + social anxiety, and my uncle is a schizophrenic. it's manageable, sort of.

whether that skews my perspective on mental health, i'm not sure. 

anyways. 

yesterday, i visited the mall. back to school shopping.

i was nervous, because the crowds were of a considerable size, but overall? pretty good.

my mother ushered me into the dressing room to try on two sweaters + a pair of shoes. an employee rushed over and quickly informed us that, no, we weren't supposed to do that. 

“you have to let an employee know *before* you enter the dressing room, and the bench for trying on shoes is over there.”

my mother commented that she wasn't aware of their policies. i could feel my face getting hot, and as soon as i closed the dressing room door, my eyes were stinging. i'm not sure why. i know that i couldn't have been that much of an inconvenience— but in that moment, i was shaken up. i quickly composed myself.

(that sounds like a wattpad excerpt i'm so sorry but i'm not sure how else to write it!!)

after trying on the sweaters, i quietly asked my mom if we could go to another store. (although, i really did want to go home.) 

she eventually agreed, but she was angry at me, because she assumed that i was embarrassed of her. (english is my mother's second language.) i assured her that was not the case! it wasn't. my mom asked, “then why did we leave the store?” and i didn't really have a proper answer. 

there was another mishap in the coffee shop, and i felt overwhelmed the entire time. in another store, i had to register for something on my phone in order to recieve a 10% discount. my mother insisted that it was a good deal, and i didn't disagree. i felt like i was holding up the line, everyone was looking at me, and i started whispering instead of talking. 

it really sucks, because i'd like to be able to shop without having to be wary of everything! i love picking out clothes! 

this isn't the first time i've exhausted myself simply by being around other people. i worry for the years ahead. i mean, i can't even approach the checkout without getting antsy. 

at school, i can't even ask to go to the washroom. i always wait for someone else to sharpen their pencil before me. i don't ask questions, even if i have them. i don't even know why, it just makes me nervous and suddenly i'm on edge. 

what if the teacher laughs at my question? what if i word it incorrectly? it's worth mentioning, maybe, that i've never been great around people. either i'll start talking too much, or too little. i think that's just because i was a pretty closed off kid. 

this is a recent thing. i think it started a year ago. i'm really not sure why. maybe this is normal, and i'm getting worked up over nothing.

I guess, at the start of this year, I realized I don’t have any real friends that I hang out with anymore. There’s the people who I frequently talk to on social media and stuff, and people who I talk to at school sometimes, but everyday I come home and our interactions end there. I wasn’t really having that many issues with it before, I understood, we’re all pretty busy, and a lot of my friends live kind of far. One of the only people I’m closed to, who I’ve also been obsessed with since the first time I saw her (2 years ago) walked into my class today while the teacher was making a seating chart, and said she really wanted to sit alone. I understood, this class is during last period and everyone is kind of tired. But When the teacher asked her why she wanted to sit alone, she said “I don’t really have any friends in this class”. I can’t even begin to describe how much it hurt me, someone who I love and thought I was close to, sees me as no more than an acquaintance.. I thought maybe she didn’t notice me, but there’s only about 15 people in the class (small school). I’m at home and I can’t get over those 9 little words, I’m so caught up in what she said.

46,"I know this isn't a subreddit for venting (or maybe it is, I'm brand new here), so I'm going to keep it as concise and as professional as possible.

Recently, I feel like I've been sort of spiraling into a dangerous thought cycle. I won't go into details on what about, but I was convinced it was caused by PMDD (not diagnosed, but I feel like being suicidal on and around my period isn't normal. Trans guy btw, not sure if thats relevant or not). The feeling has lingered, though, for about a week or two after it started, which I don't think happens with PMDD. This all doesn't really matter that much, but I feel like the background might be helpful.

Here's some more background: I use the crisis textline semi-frequently on really bad nights, but I have realized that I might be in need of continuous care that, obviously, a textline cannot provide. Of course, there are quite a few options for me, such as getting back into therapy, or talking to my doctor about a change in medication. However, an issue with this is talking to my parents, whom I love very much, about the fact that I still have these mental health issues even after the years and years of care they've given me for it (been medicated and in and out of therapy since I was 10 years old, so about 7-8 years). I have a huge issue with confronting my parents about anything involving emotions or mental health (always have, never really figured out why), as well as some shame around the fact that this keeps having to happen. All the more reason to get a therapist, but you know how it is, with vicious cycles and all.

So here I get to my point. I've been thinking about going inpatient in some local psychiatric hospital to get the care I need and maybe just get a hard reset on life, since I've let these problems go for so, so long. I'm not sure how I'd go about this, or where I'd even go. How do I approach this topic with someone (be it my parents or my doctor) without making it horribly uncomfortable for everyone? What should I expect in a psychiatric hospital? And are there any alright ones in and around Springfield, MO? I've read reviews, as well as talked to friends who had gone there, and they all say that the hospital closest to me is an absolute nightmare. I'm just not sure what steps to take from here.",21Aug2019,1

57,"Finally. After 20 years I’ve finally gone to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life.
I went twice after a major life event in my childhood that involved CPS but I don’t even remember what was asked of me or what I said.

I was scared. I could feel the familiar discomfort behind my eyes and I couldn’t help but start crying hard within the first five minutes of my session. My psychiatrist nodded her head in agreement that something was wrong. She is a sweet lady and comforted me that it was a safe space to cry.

But this isn’t a story about my first time there. In fact, it’s about the opposite of a safe space. I think I have a hunch of what’s wrong with me aside and I’m too scared to tell anyone, eventually I’ll tell my psychiatrist my hunch. There’s the whole stigma and assumptions when someone goes to therapy/any mental health help. I really wanted to tell the world I was going to a psychiatrist but I was scared to because of the criticism or rejection. So instead I made a vague story-pic on my social media of the waiting room with a brain emoji. I don’t know.. I just wanted someone who’d have a clue to notice it without me really admitting online what I was doing. And something felt awfully good about seeing one of my friends see the 24hr thing because then I had hope this person, who sometimes triggers me, would understand that I need this.

But then, I am faced with sudden regret as this friend asks how my counseling went. I tell her I don’t know my evaluation yet. She doesn’t understand. I admit more that I didn’t see a counselor, I saw a psychiatrist, and I’m waiting on a diagnosis. She says that’s great, don’t be scared, blah blah everyone puts a label on things due to stigmas. BUT THATS JUST IT. I’m swallowing hard and feeling numb, wishing I didn’t post that story-line. I deleted it instantly even if some people already saw it. This girl, who is a graduated behavioral cognitive counselor, who I’m scared of.. because I’ve heard the way she talks about people diagnosed with what I believe I may have, It’s not a safe place to discuss with her. I don’t want it held against me. So I’m leaving it at that.

P.s. My psychiatrist asked me to recall my earliest memory of trauma. I could not recall. I blanked. And then I went on a  schhpeal about as much as I’ve tried reading about trauma, I don’t understand it, and how could my trauma even be at any level of demise when there are people out there that have suffered from worser things. How could have I experienced trauma? Is trauma possible even if not involved sexually, destruction, death of someone, etc?

Feeling lost, lonely and in constant pain, I tried to end my life, but as I held the knife to my heart ready to push it in, I tried to think of reasons not to do it, of people to call for help - people who made me swear to call them if I ever needed them. Sadly I couldn't get anyone to answer my call, so I tried to think my way out of it - while the knife point already penetrated my skin...It was when I remembered a friend's words telling me of what he thought of me and how much faith he had in me, I managed to make myself let go of the knife, then cried for hours huddled on the floor and begging myself to get up and take a shower.
That was almost 3 weeks ago.

Everything I mention that can be slightly interpreted as negative is seen as an attack and makes him feel bad about himself.

Since he went to uni he stopped getting the exercise he used to have and has put on a lot of weight. While he doesn't eat super healthy I doubt he has been eating badly enough to explain all the weight he has gained over those years.
His self esteem is non existent and the weight gain has not helped him with that of course.

I feel like the stress and low self esteem have just been spiralling into more stress, weight gain and thus even lower self esteem and with every year I see him pulled deeper into this downwards spiral.

I really want him to feel happy again and to at least get some of his self esteem back.
How do I tell him that it might be a good idea to go to a psychiatrist to have a talk?
He is so sensitive that everything I say is taken as an insult or as blame on him so I really need to find the correct way to suggest this to him.",21Aug2019,4
62,"I'm aware everyone moves at their own pace and that there's healthy and unhealthy forms of mourning. I've struggled with an anxiety disorder all my life, but went through a traumatic event recently (it occured over the course of ~6 months). I got diagnosed with PTSD quite recently, but that's something I already figured I had - because of the situation I was in.

My approach to managing my mental health has always been very logistics based. I could solve how to make myself feel the best, even if I felt as though I was in the worst situation ever. I struggled immensely, but I always felt like I could engineer a solution. When I was a lot younger (19 now), I wasn't like this. I spent most of my time in bed, sleeping all day, the ""basics.""  

However, since the trauma occured, I feel mindless. The logistics part of my brain is continously telling me how I need to go about healing from this, but I feel like I need time to sulk in bed. I haven't ""mourned"" since the incident, I've yet to just sleep all day, stay in my house, one of those days - ya know? I feel like I'm trying to articulate myself in a manner where I'm neglecting my feelings of pain and just trying to find answers in how to end it. I hope that makes sense sorry. I'm worried I won't progress if I allow myself to revert to that, but I also feel like I may need that? 

Should I spend time mourning in that manner or am I suppose to jump right into recovering? Is there a specific time frame I should have in mind, when it comes to the mourning period? 

Thank you x",21Aug2019,1
63,"Alright. For context, I'm a 19-year-old from Turkey. I think all of this started maybe around when I was 9. Because when I was 9 I decided to learn English because in a game I was playing everybody was communicating and although I didn't understand their language I could tell that they were having fun and laughing their asses off. So I alt tabbed to translate every single word I saw on the chat bar and tried to come up with a response to literally everything. It kept on going like this for a while. Eventually I ended up speaking English on the same level as my mother language which is Turkish. Any how. Since before high school I was always into having friends. By the end of middle school I was a very popular kid in school and in my area but still I was extremely shy in person because of the way I was raised by my family. At the start of high school I have lost all of my friends except one and got into intense depression which I am still dealing with to this day. Different people have diagnosed me with bipolar or multiple personality disorder. I had to drop out of high school even though I had amazing grades. I was a really successful student. I have always been idealist my whole life so it was expected of me. But like I said I had to let it go. Because even though I was good at my classes, I was not good at keeping friendships healthy. Lately I figured this is because in the recent years social media has become such a big deal in everyone's lives that they started not to value actual love relationships of real life and became all about the likes and sharing everything they do on the internet. And as you might agree when you can share every single moment of your life with thousands of people, its not really that big of a deal anymore to have ""someone"" with you at any specific ""moment"" of your life. Because its more intriguing to share every moment with many people than to share some special moments with your actual loved ones. Anyways. I have the feeling that at least among the people that I know I am the only one who thinks this way. Or who thinks this way and actually lives according to the knowledge of it. Who does something about preventing the overtake of social media and losing the love relationships that ""used to"" exist. Lately with every single new person I met I have gone through the same stuff. I give them all the time I can. But they can't give 5 minutes of their days. Even weeks. It's like a day for me is 24 hours and a day for them is somewhere around 6 hours. I've observed that I care so much more than any of my friends have ever cared about me. I've tried to overcome this. Yes. Although it sounds totally nuts I have tried to care less. I literally tried to love less to be loved more. It is unbelievable. Still didn't quite work. I just can't. I am a person of love. I love people. Even writing this I feel like crying. Because if a random person underneath this post said something nice I would love them and care about them, too. That is just who I am. And it hurts more than anything that love is the reason I am hurt so much. Anyways. If you came this far I really am so grateful. I wanted to let go of these feelings for a long time and didn't know how or to whom to tell them. Feels really good to get it off my chest.

\*edit: sorry I've been all over the place with my story. It is truly difficult to keep up with the thoughts in my head when I've never actually talked about these things before.",21Aug2019,2

Im not honest with anybody. I’ve convinced myself that my lies are real. Theres nothing even wrong with me in the first place, I’ve just convinced myself there is.

65,"Ok so first a bit of an idea how I think. There are times where I am passive for some time maybe days. Other times I kind of get into the mind of like some all seeing person and I compare the world's past to it's current state, like how people act, what crime is like, the ignorance of others, or politics and I start to imagine things through the eyes and lives of others and try to come to a conclusion that can result in a better future for humanity; however sometimes during this I get a bit aggressive like thinking like a tyrant or some dictator or a crazed evolutionary seeking justice through some old world methods (ex. Guillotine, torture, things like that). Some other times I've felt quite antisocial or afraid of others especially attractive females (this usually makes me sexual frustrated). Other times I feel like looking down on everyone for their actions and how they live. Lastly there are times where my mind goes blank. I've tried many times talking to psychiatrist and mental health doctors but for some reason I'm quite passive around them but I still describe what's going on. One person managed to diagnose me with social anxiety disorder because well it's been something that is prominent with me no matter what state of mind I'm in. I thought it was DID but that's doesn't seem to be the case at this point I'm confused on what's going on.

Female to Male Transgender.

On Testosterone since April 26, 2018.

Diagnosed: Bipolar Type 1, PTSD, Compulsive Behavior Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Body Dysphoria.

Things that are going on with me today:

Severe social isolation.

Not out of the bedroom much. Stays in room no matter how hot it may be. Quit job prematurely literally to avoid people. Stuck on technology. Very little human interaction.

Hormones?

Lactation and possible 'nesting'. Thoughts of future family and life. 

RELAPSE.

Went back to meth after 38 days clean. Has not told a soul. Will be coming clean as soon as she lets me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot on my plate right now.

My Girl and I broke up, and now we're both moving out of our house.

I'm moving to West Virginia with my Aunt. I plan to attend Job Corps soon, and start building my own future. 

She's moving in the the guy she slept with while I was in the mental hospital, just a few days after we broke up.

 

This breakup is very significant to me in many ways.

I came into her life playing as her savior when her fiance, whom she had been with for over 6 years, shot and killed himself. 

He was on meth, and had untreated mental health issues.

He told me he was going to do it about a week prior.

It happened in they house they used to share, but I moved in shortly after. Neither of us were mentally stable in the relationship. 

I attempted suicide due to a depressive swing.

i went from playing savior, to being her abuser.

I was sinking like a ball and chain locked around her ankle.

I began using meth on January 31, one year after he shot himself. My Girls brother was the one that used with her fiance, and introduced it to me.

I was out of control.

One day it was  very bad. I was packing. Brittany was broken. July 4,2019. I told her how I was on meth, and how during that time period I had cheated on her with multiple men. That day I ended up in a mental hospital. She slept with him. I felt relapsed and hypocritical. 

She stays over at his house almost every night. I was clean for 38 days after July 5th. Now, I am sitting here high as a kite. I haven't ate in two days, nor have I slept the past two nights. Then there's the fact that I'm moving hours away from her. I really thought we could have had a future.

I have a message typed out for her, coming clean and being honest with her. She has always been my Rock. Unfortunately, I am her Jackhammer. I'm moving on August 24, writing this just 3 days prior. We don't talk anymore. We don't spend time together. It was all just all of a sudden.

Friday night, our last night we'll share a home, I want us to have a good one.

But what would a good one be? What should I want for myself? For her? How can I make sure our last night is a healthy one? What things should be avoided or talked about? What would a healthy emotional response be? What could we even do? What factors could be causing the isolation?",21Aug2019,1
67,"I don't want to sound insane (lol), just want to see if other people feel the same way. I am starting to believe I'm a fallen angel sent to feel the full effects of human suffering! God only knows what sins I had committed in my past life. I dont use angel in a way to imply any sort of superiority though. I look in myself and see chains and agony. An angel from a planet specifically, won't name which one. The idea of a fallen angel is appealing, because they are like an outcast as I am.

I think my soul was implanted in an evil woman and formed by the seed of an evil man just so I can feel a thousand years of pain and abuse.

I cant identify with either a man or woman because when I took the form of a woman, I was shunned. I take the form of a man, I am shunned harder. So I just don't know what I am anymore.

68,"My mom has always been controlling and my son (3 yrs) is showing troubling signs of attachment issues after having seen her more during this summer.

Would you suggest taking him to therapy or asking her to go or us (his parents in order to better handle the whole situation)? Or something else?

More info:
My mom is generally an authoritarian, overbearing and controlling teacher but with young children she can be really great because she’ll get creative and make things with them etc. She’s still controlling but little guys are more easily controlled than angsty teens, I suppose. Oh, also she’s single and has been as long as I can remember. And I’m an only child so she got to control me as much as she wanted growing up.

My son (let’s call him 3) has had issues with closely interacting with his dad since he was born and it flares more when 3 spends more time with my mom. 3 wont listen to us as closely or will push our boundaries more often after seeing her. 3 will act out and hit after as well. 3 will only snuggle with me and dad is only for climbing and rough housing. He will turn down all others to have his bedtime routine with me and unfortunately that’s just become somewhat normal for us. More recently this summer as we’ve spent more time with her, 3’s started telling dad (when going to rough house or read before bed on a night that’s dad’s turn to put him to sleep) “don’t touch me” and demand I come put him to bed.
My mom was gone for a month at the start of this summer and by the end of it, he was okay with bedtime with dad and he’d even snuggle with dad. 

My mom revels in the fact that 3 will freak out and excitedly call out to her when she arrives places and (obviously) thinks that she’s the most important in this entire scenario.

Again, we’ve tried to watch and make unbiased theories about his actions since he was born but with the repeat of his refusing close interaction with dad after seeing my mom becoming more apparent, I’m wondering where I should go from here.

Please help!",21Aug2019,2
69,"Lack of commitment

When you’re young, in love, and in a relationship, you find new ways every now and then to make your partner feel special. You never miss a chance to tell your other half how much they mean to you. You feel grateful to have them in your life and you’d do anything to keep them with you.

On the other hand, when you’re married, you start taking your partner for granted. You don’t appreciate them as much as you used to before and slowly, you start bridging a gap between the 2 of you.

You were overly affectionate in the beginning.

According to a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, couples who are overly affectionate during the beginning of their relationships are more likely to get divorced after getting married. When you display constant affection toward your spouse all the time, to the point that your “surprises” don’t even surprise them anymore, things start to get a little boring after marriage.

This not only makes your partner feel that there’s nothing exciting left to do in your relationship, but it also puts you under immense pressure. In fact, you start feeling that your efforts are going unnoticed and not being received properly. You then start to feel less desirable.

It wasn’t really “love”.

The worst mistake we all make is confusing love with infatuation. People in long-term relationships confuse being in love with being comfortable around a person and that’s where they go wrong. It’s usually after they get married that they realize they weren’t really in love.

Being in love with somebody and being fond of them are 2 entirely different things! But by the time couples realize this, it’s often too late.

Your needs have changed.

People change with time and so do their needs! Recently, celebrity power-couple Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, who have been dating for years, got divorced only a few months after getting married. Wondering why this happened? It’s because their priorities changed. In a public statement, the couple’s rep revealed that the 2 have agreed to separate as they wish to grow, and want to focus on themselves and their careers.

Change is inevitable and it comes with time. You can either grow and move forward with your partner or you can simply focus on yourself and your goals first. Marriage is beautiful but it also requires a high level of commitment, patience, and love which is the reason why after getting married, people start to feel burdened by the responsibility and prefer to be on their own to focus on their individual goals.

You just wanted to get settled.

Getting married for any reason other than love is just not going to work out. Marrying a person who you’ve dated for a long time simply because you don’t wish to go out there and do it all over again should never be a reason to get married. By doing this, you will simply waste your time and your partners. The marriage will soon fall apart due to a lack of love in the relationship.

Everybody wishes to settle down one day but you shouldn’t let peer pressure or any kind of societal expectations get the best of you. Marriage is like a bicycle that needs 2 equally dedicated tires to climb up the journey called life. If you or your longtime partner feel that you are not ready to take the next step, listen to your gut!

You discovered a new side of your partner.

Being in a long-term relationship doesn’t mean you know everything about your partner. When you get married and start to live together, juggling through life every day, you’ll discover new things about your lover — some interesting and some “bad”.

Disloyalty, dishonesty, money issues, insecurities, and over-possessiveness are some of the major red flags people discover in their relationships after getting married which often leads to their separation.

You didn’t “click” like you thought you would.

Most of us have unrealistic expectations when it comes to relationships and marriage. The image of the ’perfect happy life’ pops up in our heads thanks to having been brainwashed by movies and it’s not even close to reality. Your partner is not going to complete your sentences or memorize everything you like. Not every day is going to be full of sunshine. There will be times where your partner feels a little off and days when you need your space. Marriages work on mutual understanding.

Couples who rush into getting married without giving it deep thought, thinking that everything will work out because they have known each other for so long, end up divorcing each other after only a few months because they’re likely not mentally ready for the responsibilities that come with the entire package. They feel disappointed when reality hits them and overwhelmed by the commitment marriage requires to function correctly.

72,"I haven't really struggled with insomnia this terrible since this summer. I have been shooting a web series and it got extremely stressful and taxing to my mental health- but I'm pushing on.

Shoots began around 9am, my friends and I would film until we ran out of daylight, and I'd be absolutely drained by around 8pm. But no matter how physically exhausted I was, my anxiety and racing thoughts keep my up. The later it got, the harder it was to sleep, and I found I would finally pass out between 5:30-6am. I would still have to get my ass out of bed by 9am.

This continued for ~3 weeks, and shoots are over now, but I'm still completely unable to fall asleep. Now I can't fall asleep until my body is literally at 0% around 7-9am. It's ridiculous.

My appetite is suffering and I'm losing a lot of weight, the first few weeks this was happening I was waking up sick and throwing up in the mornings.  Weed is usually my medicine when my anxiety keeps me up, but for the summer I'm staying in a state where it's illegal so I haven't been buying bud and carts are expensive here.

73,"First of all if reading about sexual abuse is an issue for you understand this is the forewarning.

So, awhile back I was in the U.S. Navy and everything was great, I was in peak health, my head was in a good place, I had a fantastic work ethic, practically shittin rainbows.

Than I got hurt, long story short I ended up with nerve and muscle damage to my right arm. It was pretty bad, I couldn't even tie my boots or stretch a blousing strap (little hooked elastic guy used to tuck pant legs). I remember one day I had a semi-public freakout at a bowling alley on base because I couldn't even pull my wallet outta my pocket. Not to mention the constant pain. I didn't think it could get any worse. I have since decided that anyone who even thinks this is just a glutton for punishment, of course it could get worse and it did.

Sorry quick life backstory. To save on a too long story, I had a shitty childhood (who didn't?) my father was a very busy man running his own buisness and he wasn't home a lot, my mother was a drug addict, and that was her best trait. If I had pick her worst trait it was probably all those times over the years she'd bring men over and whore me out to them. Either that or it was the time when my dad finally found out some of what was going on and tried to put a stop to it so she told the police he was the one abusing me so the officer showed up and arrested him and the officer told me ""don't worry son, you'll be safe now"" as he took away the one person in this world trying to keep me safe and left me alone with her. It took awhile but eventually my Dad got me out of there.

Anyway, after I got hurt I started having nightmares, where I was being attacked but no matter who or what it was, no matter what they wanted, no matter how much I'd fight I'd always be to weak. Than I started to have some pretty serious anxiety and depression issues, I started having panic attacks, than I started having nightmares while I was awake, sometimes I'd just be back there again for like an instant, sometimes I'd just get reminded, often the memories are so warped and scrambled by my own fear and almost 2 decades that I've got to question if it was even real or if I've just gone bat shit crazy and haven't realized yet. Sometimes I really question that part.

I don't talk about this very often, but I actually kinda blame myself, which I know is completely and utterly stupid. I was 7, maybe 8 when my dad got me out of there, I wouldn't expect an 8 year old to even understand that kind of situation much less do something about it, but still, I just hate myself for being so weak. I think getting hurt stirred up a lot of these feelings, namely my fear of weakness.

I am female but I don’t really “feel” female or male. I have both stereotypical masculine and feminine traits. It has only been since I’ve come off hormonal contraception that I feel more “female” because I have instinctual desires now, but not having these never made me feel male.

I don’t understand the desire to change ones body to appear as the opposite sex. 
Is this bred from societal pressures that make you feel like you don’t belong in a given gender group because you don’t have the stereotypical traits?
I feel like kids are quickly labelled feminine or masculine when they are young, because of what they like to do or wear; of course that doesn’t mean they are trans or will grow up to be trans - but do labels like this make one feel they do not belong to their biological sex?

Or is it something deep inside you?

For example, last night my wife and I were watching a random drama on TV and the husband died. The rest of the night I -worried- about dying and my wife and kids being alone and how fucked up that’ll make my kids. At one point I let out a big audible exhale and my wife asked what was wrong. I just said “I don’t know.” Because I don’t know. When do I “call it” and start meds? How long do people need meds? I am scared of what meds will do to me too. Any insight is appreciated.

89,"Heya. I'm turning 18 in a few months here. In the last year or so, I've lost myself. I've lost the cheerful, energized, ambitious side of me that I had around my freshman year of high school. I've become boring. 

My overprotective parents have had me stay inside for all of my life. The few close friends that I've been able to see, I see infrequently. When I get out often, I'm given weird commentary on how I'm not spending enough time with my family. We don't need to go over details here. Overall, I'm not able to do anything for myself. If I do, I'm called selfish. I'm being ""a stereotype"" in wanting to be independent with things. I'm studk in my house, where I'm not allowed to be me. At this point, I'm entering adulthood where I don't have any idea of who I am. I understand the whole ""you're young! You don't have to know who you are!"" it's not that sort of thing. I'm not confused, I'm empty. 

I'm struggling right now with the fact that I've missed out on all of the pleasures of being a 15/16/17 year old guy that can get out and find who he is. I have pretty bad social anxiety with people that I haven't known since I didn't care about my living situation. Before I wanted to be myself/independent, I didn't have to put up with the constant struggle of getting these things. 

You know, part of me wishes that I COULD be this said ""stereotypical teenager"". If that means getting out, fucking up, learning by doing, I'm all for it. At this point, I don't know where to go with myself.

I haven't made new friends, haven't branched out, which has developed into social anxiety that makes that much harder. 

I haven't had the opportunity to date, which has caused social anxiety that makes it difficult.

My mood is unstable, on a mood stabilizer-ish medication that I haven't had much luck with.

This might be a bit out of place, but if anyone's heard the song ""streetlights"" by Kanye West, it sums up a lot of how I feel now.

All of the opportunities/streetlights that have come my way have left just as quickly.

I haven't been allowed to be a child. I haven't been allowed to be an adult. I'm completely lost. 


I don't know if I could come up with a solid question for you all here. I just need a little bit of support. How do I live? I haven't had the opportunity to. I've been in places where I was on the edge of making that fact permanent.

What do I do with myself? How do I build the motivation to do anything?

Thanks for reading.",21Aug2019,9

I guess the nearly constant palpitations and muscle pain weren’t any indication. I’m so thankful that I did realize it and now have a much better support system than I did as a child.

Was feeling super depressed since around January/December and just feel like even though it took me eight months to get here, at least I’m aware of what is happening in my body. 

I stopped going ACA (Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families) when I started Dialectical Behavior Therapy because it was too overwhelming to do therapy, DBT, and ACA. However, in two weeks back at ACA I realized all the issues I’ve been having are related to my insecurities and triggers from childhood. 

Thankfully, I’m not in the same position I was as a kid. I’m no longer helpless. I have a job and can provide for myself. 

I’m getting back to things that help my mental health- exercise, healthy eating, meditation, yoga, community, friends.

I had to leave work early yesterday because I could not calm myself down. I was dissociating and could not process any information other than the fact I knew I had to get out of there. I took time to cry and freak out once I got home, but my immediate reaction was to quit and never go back. That’s how awful I felt- I was worried that if I go back I would have a full psychotic break because I felt so out of control. I have a history of depression and severe anxiety. I’ve had situations similar to this in the past where my fight or flight mode kicked in, but I’ve never had it happen so acutely or impact my cognition as much as this has. I am extremely shaken. 

After calming down, I decided my best course of action was to call into work today and call my manager to have a frank discussion wherein I will tell him that I am experiencing unexpected mental health concerns that are currently making it impossible for me to function at work. I am going to request a few days away from the office before I make a decision as to how I wish to proceed. I do not see myself staying, but I also do not want to regret anything because I made a decision while panicking.

My 27th birthday is in a little over a month, which I think is contributing to this.

As the title says. I think this is not normal

For example, I have a dayoff today. This morning I was productive for updating my website, but from the afternoon to the night I did nothing other than eating sleeping resting and watching movies with my wife and now I am ready to sleep but with guilty feeling for doing nothing productive.

I was trained this way by my parents since my childhood. Even when I was sick, if I was *just* laying in bed they would yell at me for doing nothing, even though they clearly knew I was sick.

Now I am an adult and this has been bugging me. This makes me unable to enjoy leisure time such as dayoff or vacation.

Is this normal?

If not, how can I cure myself from this?

Please advise

106,"I'm a fairly recent graduate of high school (sixth form) and for a long time I've been completely disregarded in almost every aspect. I've suffered with severe test anxiety (along with other mental health issues) for upwards of 5 years now, and despite all my attempts to communicate it to people, even those with positions of power (therapists/GP/school teachers etc), I'm endlessly shot down. I'm not sure where this anxiety stemmed from: whether it's school trauma or pressure/stress from a young age, I just don't know. It's debilitating. I was/am a prospective student with a high ability in all my subjects, but when it came to exams, I found myself immobilised. I felt paralysed, not from fear, but from a blank mind. I wasn't able to move my arm to write, unable to think at all, even with tonnes of prep. Every time I try to tell someone about this, they don't believe it's an actual thing, they just get frustrated and angry at me, insisting I mustn't have put in any work or effort. 

It got to a point where I had revised and knew my stuff, but couldn't bring myself to work anymore. I'd do work from time-to-time, and could recite things well as they were part of my muscle memory at that point, but I'd lost the ability to work properly and intensively; that naturally coupled with a mental health deterioration. I'd get shouted at and frowned upon for it. Most of the people who'd berate me about not doing work would insist that I'm deliberately ""choosing"" not to do work, when in fact it was/is the opposite. I desperately want to do the work that's set me, but I cannot compel myself to do it; my body doesn't want to get up and do the task. The way I suffer with depression and anxiety is already difficult to communicate - I've been told that I'm a liar, a procrastinator, that I just ""need to do it, get it done and not to think about it"". I'm sure we all know it isn't that simple. 

How do I even begin to communicate this to people and get them to understand? I'm so lost and I'm in desperate need of help.

119,"Loss and grief, two things that we all experience, yet two things people can’t seem to understand. Loss can refer to many things. You can lose people in your life, whether by death or just parting ways. You can lose jobs, financial situations, friends, property/possessions, hell you can even lose your sanity. I think another big loss that people often discount is when things don’t go the way you expected. Some say this isn’t a loss because it never happened, but you can grieve something you wanted to happen when it doesn’t, that’s still a loss!

Grief is how we process these losses, and damn it’s hard. It will be different for everyone, but we all essentially go through the same phases: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The problem is, people often expect others to go through each phase the same way they did and at the same pace. For the love, we can’t seem to just let people grieve! 

So often people throw cliche phrases at people who are grieving, as if that will help them through the process. 
“They’re in a better place”
“It wasn’t the right time”
“It will happen when it’s supposed to”
“Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened”
And so on...

How about instead of trying to force people through the process of grief we just let them grieve?! How about we let them know we are there for them through the process and that it’s ok for them to feel exactly what they are feeling at that moment. How about we shut our big fat mouths and open our ears and hearts!

123,"Hey all!  


First of all, thanks for reading my post. Now, let's get into this.  


Being young, you always find yourself fighting your parents, in real time or in your head. The problem is, my parents are so god damn clueless about some things that it drives me nuts, and I can't stop fighting with them in my head. It's also worth mentioning that I'm the youngest of the family and my older brother and sister supported their standpoints just to keep the peace in the house (and also obviously because they can't be arsed to fight with them for the 1000th time). I always feel stressed out because my voice isn't either heard, acknowledged or appreciated at all, and I always am trying to prove it- but 99% of the ""proving"" is happening inside my head.

124,"I am a 26 year old male. On the surface I am doing well in life, a good paying job, a fiancé that loves me deeply, a nice rental house that’s well decorated.

Inside I am a wreck and it’s taken me this long to figure it out. I have skeletons that someone who grew up middle class and privileged like me shouldn’t. 

Just recently I was on my bachelor party trip, I don’t drink often (i smoke pot about 3x a week) but I got fucked up (and drugged) and I touched someone inappropriately. I felt such remorse I told my fiancé immediately. This has happened before where I gave a girl a back rub and stopped before it went further. 

I guess that stuff is relevant looking back. I have ADHD and severe anxiety.  I sometimes worry there is more. I don’t think I’m a sociopath or anything because I feel really deeply for others, but somethings off. My brain has been in a fog for months now and my head always feels like a rubber band about to snap. 

I worry what that snap will bring. See both times I screwed up with other women I felt like it wasn’t me doing it, it felt like another person that’s dormant inside me that took over once I was really fucked up. I hate that person. He’s not me, I’m sensitive and wouldn’t hurt anyone like that. 

Also it seems like it comes out randomly when I’m not intoxicated. I have sex-somnia where in my sleep I will touch and try to sleep with my fiancé. I also have this weird drive towards other women sometimes where I get really sexually attracted to them for periods of time and I look them up online and sometimes think of them when touching myself. This all sounds so creepy coming out but it just scares me, I guess I’m sort of coming back to reality and realizing that part of me is a twisted sexual person. I like sex but it isn’t all that matters to me, I just want to feel normal like everyone else seems to be. 

I feel like I’m misunderstood, I feel like I’m sick, and I feel like I hate myself sometimes. I’m also incredibly hard on myself and it’s almost sad.

I feel completely crazy and scared of my own mind, I need help.",21Aug2019,1

126,"i am a late diagnosed autistic and have had OCD/GAD/SAD/temporarily BDD ever since i can remember. i started self harming when i was a toddler by jumping off furniture to throw myself on the ground, i had verbally aggressive tantrums and severe separation anxiety. my parents are emotionally neglectful so none of this was seen as a problem, they just pretended not to see it. i was only diagnosed at 22 when i started seeing a therapist on my own. i was severely emotionally parentified and lived through trauma so i learned how to mask every single problem incredibly well, forcing myself to ignore all my pain and go on. it's like i lived my entire life with a broken limb without ever saying anything about it because i never had any other choice - expressing pain wasn't an option. i've had really bad meltdowns all my life, though only at home, social problems and avoidance of lots of every day activities but everyone just ignored it because they thought i was normal.

in my family, it's not normal to go to the doctor when you need help. you just shut up and go on like nothing is happening, even for physical problems. when i had panic attacks and couldn't breathe for several days, and genuinely thought i was going to die, my parents told me that it wasn't worth going to the hospital so i didn't. medication was never an option for me - they refused to get me even sleep aids because in my country you need a prescription by a psychiatrist for that, and they believe it's ""exaggerated"" to get it especially from a psych because it's not that serious.

i was told multiple times by my psych that she has no idea how i managed to live with my frequency of intrusive thoughts for 20 years and not have psychosis. that my suffering has taken so many forms that it's hard to diagnose because its so deeply radicated. and yet, i feel like i dont have it bad enough. i feel like if i had been suffering for real, they would have had no choice but get me hospitalized or medicated, and yet even my therapist believes i don't need medication and that it's good that i never took it. i would have dropped out of school instead of painfully crawling through it all until the end. i would have isolated more and lost my only friend, but instead i only isolate for a week at most. i would harm myself more seriously, instead i just pathetically hit myself and don't truly injure myself and that's not serious enough. i would have never been able to pass for normal if it was serious enough.

i try to justify my resilience by reminding myself that i lived in extreme survival mode all my life and never had any chance to make the choice to drop out or ask for help or express my pain - it never existed. but it still feels like i have only mild suffering and that none of my pain is serious enough. i am tired of being told that ""all pain is real pain"" when objectively there's much more severe pain and mild pain. every time i hear this it makes me want to self harm so bad, i've been clean for a month now but the urge is incredibly strong and i dont even want to bother resisting it if it's not even a serious way to injure myself, it's not even worth being stopped because it doesn't injure me enough to be considered serious.

i don't know what to do. i am envious of people who were recognized as suffering, because it means their pain was so severe and real that it left everyone else no choice. mine isn't because i haven't had it bad enough to leave everyone else no choice but to recognize it. i want to do so much worse to myself but i fail i dont know how to cope with any of this.

my resilience disgusts me and i hate it more than anything else. i just want to break down and let myself go. i dont want to resist anymore and yet it feels like no matter what i do, my body and brain keep resisting no matter what. it feels like i could fast and not sleep for a week and still would be able to go on like not much is happening. i hate my resilience and i dont want it anymore.",21Aug2019,1

128,"I'm currently in therapy for my depression and anxiety. I recently had some losses in my life that seem to be bring old wounds to the surface. I'm currently trying to work through with the help of my therapist and my husband. 

The session that I had yesterday brought up a lot of stuff. I have some forgotten grief along with some compound grief that I never dealt with properly. I have a tendency to push things back and repress my emotions until they no longer bother me. On the outside I seem fine, but on the inside I have a lot weighting me down. 

The homework I was giving by my therapist was to stop pushing things back. I need to open up to my husband more and allow myself to feel my emotions. My husband is currently away on work, so he's not here to help me through this right now. He's trying, but it's hard when he's not here. 

I feel like I can't stop crying. I have all of these emotions that are currently boiling over. I just keep on crying. It will slow down for a bit and then I start thinking about one thing or another and it just starts back up.

131,"I think this is my first actual post on Reddit. So hi everyone. 

I’ve been really struggling with something for the past week and a half. I love self-sufficiency-ish, homesteading-ish type stuff - growing my own food, making things from scratch... all that jazz. So, a couple of years ago I bought a pair of dairy goats. And about a week and a half ago, I sold a baby goat (a necessary part of using goats for milk, unless you’re going to cook the ones you don’t want for milking, or unless you have an awful lot of land and you can just keep them all). 

I love animals, and I really, really tried to find the little guy a great home where he could have a nice life as a pet or a companion to other dairy goats - I don’t have a problem with people eating meat, but I don’t want my own little goats turned into cabritos. I care about them too much. 

I did a little photo shoot and made a really lovely Craigslist post for him, emphasizing in the post that I would only sell him to someone who could convince me they would take great care of him, because his well-being is important to me.

I felt good about the efforts I was making for my little goat. I feel down a lot and have trouble keeping motivated sometimes (I won’t call it depression as I haven’t been diagnosed, but...). Sometimes being down makes me kind of lazy, and I don’t do things as well as I wish I would, and then I have regrets later. But this time I did good. I honestly believe I did everything I could think of to give this goat a good life. 

After a few frustrating “what’s the least you’ll take for the goat?” e-mails, I thought I found someone ideal to take him. She wanted to surprise her mother with some pet goats because her mom loves goats. She assured me her large yard was well fenced and that Kai (the goat) would love it. She was picking up a few other young goats the same weekend she hoped to pick up mine, and he would have friends (very important for goats). She had kept goats before and was experienced with them, plus she lived close to a vet.

It seemed great. 

The day came for her to pick him up and I was emotional. I didn’t want to cry in front of this stranger I barely knew, but I was giving her an animal I cared about and I would miss him because he was a very sweet little guy. So yeah, I cried. I was embarrassed and ashamed about it, but I couldn’t help it. 

She was nice and asked me if I would be okay, and I told her I would and thanked her and she took him away, promising to send pictures.

I sent her a quick text after I’d calmed down a bit, saying I was sorry for getting all emotional and thanking her for giving Kai a good home. I was worried she would think I was a big pansy and be disgusted with me for crying, and not want to message me anymore, because hey, I don’t really know what kind of person this girl is, and some people are pretty uncaring when it comes to stuff like that, and of course I wanted to know if he made it to her place okay and if he adjusted well and all that. So I didn’t want her thinking badly of me and not wanting to communicate with me anymore. 

Anyway, I worried and felt ashamed all day until that evening when she finally messaged me back, only to say that Kai got to her place fine but jumped the fence and joined a neighbor’s large goat herd. I sent a nice message back, not wanting to assume this was her fault or that she wasn’t going to take good care of him. After all, I was probably being irrational worrying about how I’d cried in front of her, and goats can escape some of the best-fenced yards (I’ve had one escape my own pasture multiple times). So I just sent a friendly message back about how one of my goats had jumped a six-foot fence once or twice, and “Hopefully when you pick up the other goats he’ll stay put” and such things. 

And then I never got another reply. I sent another text and I think two e-mails (not on the same day), all brief and friendly, not wanting to assume anything. Just checking in, did you manage to get Kai back in your yard okay? Nothing. Not a word. 

Kai was wearing a collar when she took him - he will eventually outgrow it. Also he was banded (for wethering) and could develop an open wound when his, uh... well, when his nuts drop off. And as far as I know, he’s just out in some field and nobody’s checking on him or anything. 

I’m very worried. I tried so hard to make sure he would have a good person to take care of him, and despite my efforts it looks like I’ve given this baby to someone who actually doesn’t care at all. I don’t know what to do. What if she just leaves him running with this large herd of goats and he outgrows his collar and it chokes him? What if he gets an infection and nobody notices and he just suffers out there? The only thing I can think of to do is just hope I’m somehow misunderstanding, and that this girl is taking good care of him and just not communicating with me for some reason. I feel so helpless - all I can do is trust this stranger even though I honestly feel like she’s completely betrayed me. 

I hate it. Why do people suck so much? How can I ever sell another goat after this? I mean, I knew there were a lot of shitty people out there, but I thought I was reasonably good at detecting them. Now I have no faith in my abilities to judge people whatsoever. I really need to sell my buck, as we are keeping two of his daughters and we obviously don’t want them breeding... how the heck am I going to handle that?

Also, how could this girl leave me hanging like this? How could she care so little as to just tell me he got out and then never respond to me again? How do you find the nice people that don’t do shit like that? Stuff like this makes me want to become a hermit. 

I was seriously down for several days after this. I could barely function. I spent all my free time either worrying and crying or watching funny things on YouTube and just trying not to think about it. I quit journaling. I’m still staying up late and not sleeping well almost two weeks later - I don’t want to lie in bed and just have to think about this, I guess, so I find interesting stuff to read or watch and I just stay awake until I’m too exhausted and I pass out. 

I’m a wife and a mom and I have other animals to take care of, and I have a job, and I’ve just been doing the minimum mostly and... I’m just not doing well. I know there’s nothing I can do for that little goat now, and it kills me when I think about it. I was responsible for his life and I failed him. My best efforts weren’t good enough. This is just a very hard thing to accept. 

I guess I’m looking for advice, because I don’t know how to get from here to a place that isn’t extremely painful. What the hell do you do in a situation like this?

I've gotten better at interacting with other people. I struggle a lot in groups, I haven't been able to get through that barrier yet. Which has made it hard for me to work since I was only able to bond with the coworkers I was alone with, the others disliked me.

I eat Vyvanse to treat my adhd. It helps me a ton when I feel good about life.

When I feel down it doesn't do much. I'm more focused, but the will to get things done isn't there. I use all that focus on the internet. All day on the computer.  I know It's a problem but I can't find the motiviation to do better things.

I think It's the depression. Vyvanse doesn't help me with that.

I've noticed that I always have a few weeks where I feel fantastic. I'll start working out regurarly, take walks, socialize. Then my mood It switches out of nowhere and I feel depressed. Sometimes the lows are mind and I'm able to push through it, other times It's extreme and I end up losing all my progress.

Backstory: I have always been told that I was sensitive since young. I saw it as a weakness and tried to hide that side of me. My friends see me as a 'cheerful' 'happy go lucky' kind of person, I rarely tell someone when I'm upset not because I don't trust them but because I'm afraid they'll only like me when I'm in my best mood. I'll end up isolating myself from everyone until I'm the 'best' version of myself. 

Fast forward: This year has been tough for me, I thought I could handle it on my own but lately I've been spiralling - it's like I'm digging my own hole and I don't know how to get out of it. I tried distracting myself with reading, painting but it feels forced, not like how I used to enjoy them. Even doing a small thing like getting up to shower seems to require so much energy. I thought of sharing what I'm going through to someone but I feel like no one really cares about me. Most of my friends are overseas and they've got their own stuff going on. I talk on the phone once every 2-3 weeks, other than that I'm on my own. I really do want to reach out but the last time I did, i got responded with 'I feel like you do this to yourself' and 'stop being so sensitive'. I felt hurt that someone close would say that, then I reminded myself to 'not be so sensitive' because look where that got me...I'm stuck in a loop. I wish I knew how to turn my mind off.

I am terrified of new experiences, or change. Being thrown into social gatherings terrifies me. Interacting with strangers makes me freeze.

Anyways... Due to my past I went from being what I would consider healthy, confident with high self esteem to unhealthy and very low self esteem. I am scared of everything and I worry about everything (for example: getting together with friends, crossing the road, going to the grocery store, taking my dog for a walk, etc) I find myself analyzing every single thing that happens throughout my day. I am constantly asking myself why did this happen, what could have happened instead, how does this make me feel, etc. My brain never shuts off. I excessively clean my genitals, excessively wipe and check my underwear (I HATE if there is any sort of wetness), I immediately have to clean after sex, I can't stand getting any sexual discharge on my bed, and I relentlessly pick my ""chicken skin"" on my arms and blackheads/pimples on my face. I constantly ask my boyfriend if he is mad at me if he seems off and he usually ends up getting upset because I ask him too often. I know I do, but sometimes I seriously cant help it. I also research everything online, probably to a unhealthy degree. I also always feel inferior. I know deep down that I am beautiful and smart but I never feel beautiful. My hair NEVER feels nice, my skin is discoloured and I always have pimples, I'm not fit enough, etc. I get nervous talking to people I know but not very well. I also dont like when people look at me in public. I wonder what they are thinking. I never used to be this way. 

I do not have any compulsions that I can think of that are what you would consider classic OCD. But I have recently learned that it is possible to only have mental compulsions. 

Does this sound like it could be OCD as well? Or do you think my diagnosis is correct? Is this worth going through the hassle of trying to be re-evaluated?

Thanks in advance!!!",21Aug2019,1

151,"Before I start this I just want to say I feel fine, but I'm drifting from conversation. I feel like I have an identity disorder; I'm disassociative from my emotions, I usually don't open up to people and I keep everything to myself. As the days go by I'm becoming invisible, I don't talk to anyone daily and conversations are usually 2 responses. I feel I am mentally stable for the most part but I'm not socialising properly. I find a lot of my interactions with friends boring, I feel I'm not where I want to be and I can't talk to people about my ambitions. I go days without speaking to people, I even feel that my language has deteriorated by lack of usage. I'm attracted to very few people and I find I'm satisfied by a cerberal sexual fantasy rather than the person. I've taken a multi-dimensional approach to depression so I don't think it's solely that.   


I don't want sympathy or anything, but if people can guide me to a text I can read, a psychological condition or relate to me in a way that's less alienating that would be nice. Hey, maybe I'm just experiencing loneliness.",21Aug2019,1
152,"I have had a rough childhood up as I grew knowing that I was unworthy and ugly. The only compliment that I remember ever getting was that I was skinny. Somewhere along the way I lost myself completely. I was influenced by impossible beauty standards on the internet, my toxic friends and my unsupportive family. I was abused both physically and mentally, but I thought it was all normal, I didn’t know any better. I hit rock bottom in the summer of 2018 when I realized that I was unloved by everyone I knew, even me (especially me). 

It’s strange. I feel so angry, sad, confused, frustrated to the point where all these emotions make me numb. It happens in stages too. First I’d get extremely angry over myself for whatever reason eg. my appearance or my capabilities. After beating myself up for it I’d get extremely sad and wonder why I can’t be anyone else. I’d start crying silently, in hopes that no one can hear nor see me. The crying is always so uncontrollable. It would all suddenly stop and I’d feel numb. I would feel lighter, like a hole going through my heart as if something had disappeared. I’d go to bed just so the day could be over. For the next couple of days I’d feel absolutely nothing. I didn’t feel angry or sad or happy. I just felt empty

I often wonder if anyone can truly love and love me not out of pity.",21Aug2019,1

154,"I’ve been so busy fighting my trauma that I go through, that I feel like I’ll never move forward. I’m in the same position as I was after I got out of high school only now I’m 20 instead of 18. Everyone around me is disappointed that I haven’t lived up to their standards and that weighs on me every day. I’m just going to amount to nothing, right? That’s what it seems like.",21Aug2019,1
155,"I am 23, male, I have felt like complete shit for the past 6 years, and I don't know why. Like complete profane trash. I'm not even religious and I feel blasphemous, like my very existence goes against everything sacred. This feeling, it's profound. I wouldn't call it just depression. It's depression, anxiety, fear, hopelessness, sadness, despair, anger, hate, dread, misery, DISAPPOINTMENT all in one packet, a tragic feeling of irreparable catastrophe. Doom is another word I would use. I feel doomed, I feel we all are doomed. But I also feel evil, like it's somehow all my fault.

I feel there is something nefarious about this life. Like there is some sort of malicious intent to this reality, to being a human in this world. I'm sorry for saying these words. I hate my self for saying these words, because there is so much about this life that I love and want to protect, such as my family and nature. I find them beautiful and sacred so I don't understand why I have to feel like this.

I've become really good at masking this disease. The only one who knows is my mother. Most of the time I don't know where I gather the will to leave the house. But I don't want to disappoint my family, or society, so I go to college and I work a job. I also try to exercise at least 4 times a week, but I do that for me. As a matter of fact if I don't work out I feel much worse, borderline suicidal. 

I think I had a normal childhood and I am not aware of having some trauma. As far as I ca remember I was a normal and content person up until I turned 17, more or less. My mother and I have had this talk, we both agree that I used to be normal up until adulthood. I've been to a couple specialists whom I spilled my guts to. Nothing they could say was of much value, they don't know the reason I feel this way. I got a zoloft prescription and I took it for two months, mentally I wasn't much different and honestly the drowsiness was not worth it, on top of that I was having trouble performing in bed. So I stopped taking it. I am not convinced that I should solve this problem through drugs.

The world is going to end in 5 minutes. We are doomed. I don't know how else to describe it.

I am desperate, and mainly looking to see if anyone else has felt this way before, or if they feel this now.",21Aug2019,1
157,Best case scenario happened. I didnt have to go through an abortion because my body naturally miscarried. My relationship with my boyfriend ended through this and now I'm finally getting over the relationship itself and I am actually feeling okay about the breakup now.

158,"I'm not suicidal, but I have suicidal thoughts almost daily... normally as I'm waking up.  I have thoughts about walking out into my front yard and blowing my head off.  I have no plans or intent to do so.  These are intrusive thoughts that I manage day to day.  I know they are not healthy.  They are disturbing thoughts.  I have no intent to act on them, but it's always an option.  I don't like that option.

I have an aversion to traditional mental health treatment (i.e. I don't want to get hooked on a circular of psychologist/MD/drug therapy.  I've tried several 12 step and Buddhist-type programs.  They help, but they aren't the answer.

159,"This might sound weird and I am kinda embrassed but I think I have a mental issue, I am not sure..? I have sudden urge to chew on stuff late at night. I guess it calms me down somehow? 

This behavior contributed to my weight gain, I am not hungry I simply want something to chew on. I had a habit as a child to chew on my shirt &amp; straws. Then I replaced that hobby by chewing on actual food and that lead to my weight gain.

I tried chewing gum instead but it didn't work, it hurts my jaw after time and stresses me out for some reason..

So, is there something I can chew on without gaining any weight that won't affect my teeth? Or a way to relieve my stress and stop myself from eating/chewing on stuff at night..?",21Aug2019,2
160,"I’m not sure if it is.

I mean on the side of the therapist. I know like that they want to care and help of course. But it’s like, treating another human being as a service. Particularly for something so difficult. I’m not sure it seems right to me. People should help each other because they care about that person as an individual not because they’re obligated to care about everyone who gets assigned to them.",21Aug2019,0

Whenever I try to think of solutions or what to do with my life, something in my brain just forces my thoughts in certain directions.

Antidepressants absolutely terrify me, idk why. I'm trying so hard to convince myself that everything is okay and that she will be fine but every time I think about it I get so unbelievably anxious.

Idk if I don't like the idea of her being dependent on medication or what it is. I'm scared this feeling won't pass. I understand that she needs this, that it'll make her feel better but I'm just so fucking scared idk what to do about it.",21Aug2019,1

168,"There’s not really any well-constructed way I can put this, but I have to get it off my chest because it’s eating away at me and I can’t find anything else online about it. 

Basically, one of the hardest things for me to do is brush my teeth. Every time I see a toothbrush or toothpaste I literally avoid looking the best I can. I can’t watch videos with retainers because of how horribly they freak me out. I’ve talked to my therapist about it and she told my dad that I’ve really only brushed my teeth about 3~ times in the past month, and he was upset and disappointed about it.

Being told it’s “disgusting” and “gross” honestly doesn’t help me. Watching me do it, maybe that does help, but not much more. I don’t know what it is, but when I even pick up a toothbrush I veer on the edge of a panic attack. Putting it in my mouth is even worse. I can’t breathe after. I’ve spent the last thirty minutes crying because I’m so fucking pathetic I can’t even brush my teeth. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel horrible and disgusting and all of these things, and yet I still can’t do it. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest, maybe be given some advice or literally anything. Thanks.",21Aug2019,42

I’ve had an issue since the age of 12 where I talk not to myself, but to other non-existent people that I feel are watching me... I’m trying to get over this but I always end up reflecting my life and expressing my thoughts to these invisible people. 

These people are never the same, they always seem to have a different personality. Sometimes the same one will stay for weeks.

I know this is a strange fragment from my imagination because the only place where I don’t feel watched is my bathroom. And I can automatically block the feeling when I’m in embarrassing situations.

I have a theory that this habit was born because of an intense teenage-depression I was going through back when I was 12-13. In these times I felt incredibly lonely and I can only assume that talking to these non-existent was a way to satisfy the need of someone to talk to. 

Please help me figure out if I’m the only one with this habit.

175,"I had just gotten back into town so when I checked my calendar it was on a different time zone (and I forgot iphone switches appts to suit time zone).   I came for my appointment time (what I thought it was) and was an hour off just missed it.  I understand it is on me to make sure I get there at the correct time, but just was thrown off and had attended a funeral and whatever I was scatterbrained I supposed to forgot my phone does that.  I saw her for a moment before she saw her next client at the time I though (originally) was mine and she said ""I waited the whole hour for you to show up and you no showed, so I went ahead and charged you the full fee.  If you're mad about it and don't want to reschedule with me, just tell me because I have a long waitlist of clients who want to see me and I'm seeing 40 clients already. I don't my waste time with clients who don't bother to show up."" 

I get it, I accpet she had to charge, the fee charge, but it bothered me how fast she was to charge and not to call first as a courtesy.  And as a therapist myself, I always have been courteous and called/left VM if no pick up to let a client know we had a session, use empathy in my tone and comments, and kindly explain that I have to charge for the missed session per our contract (I give new clients one free miss though, which this psychologist does not which is personal style, so that is what it is).  I checked my bank account and see she charged me 15 minutes before my session was even 'over' that she sat waiting for, and am totally bothered she had an hour paid by the client but couldnt bother to call and touch base.   Am I overreacting by her lack of empathy and professional etiquette?  Perhaps I'm being too harsh based on how I choose to work with  clients. It totally ruined any rapport with her, and she's the only therapist who takes my insurance in a 10 mile radius so it totally bums me out.  Constructive feedback, alt perspectives, etc. totally welcome.   I just needed to vent ha.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr my therapist charged me full fee when I mixed up session time by an hour, told me she had a waitlist if I was mad and didn't want to reschedule that I was replaceable, and with no call first charged me 15 min before my 'scheduled' session was over, while acting as if my time mixup from traveling to a funeral in a different time zone and not realizing the phone adapted the times was a legit 'I don't care' no show.
