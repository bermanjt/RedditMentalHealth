I literally just try to keep busy, I'm driving Uber while looking for a job with no luck. It's been going on for about 3 months I'll get these feelings, and then I'll cry and just tell myself it'll be ok. But lately it's getting harder to do so. I have no insurance and can't see a therapist and I just feel like I'm alone with no one to talk to. I just feel overwhelmed and I want to just crawl in a ball and just go away. I just don't want to be here anymore. These feelings are becoming more frequent añd harder to shake please help thanks in advance.",29Dec2019,2
1,"Sometimes at random moments I will feel like I’m trying to recall a memory and then it will rush into my mind super intensely and it will feel like my entire world changed. It’s like I am in a dream and a bunch of things about the dream are rushing into my head super fast. This causes me to have a slight stomach ache and afterwards I get a slight headache. I can kinda realize none of it is real, especially after it happens but the troubling part is that afterwards my memory feels completely wrecked. I can’t remember very well what I was thinking about before and it feels like I just forget a lot of things. It’s like my brain is re-wired. Sometimes it shifts my mood as well. Sometimes afterwards I’m filled with lots of motivation and I don’t feel as sluggish. Sometimes I just feel kinda crappy. If I play along and try remembering everything about my fake dream situation, it gets more intense and my stomach and headache and memory loss feel worse afterwards. If I repeat in my head that it’s not real and try and bring myself back into real life it seems like it goes away sooner. That’s kinda hard to do though since in the moment I really want to remember everything about this fake reality.
I’m not sure what triggers it but usually it starts when I’m in a situation related to what the fake dream is. It feels like it’s always random. Sometimes I’ll go months without my brain glitching out, as I’ve come to think of it. But sometimes it’s a few times a week or even a few times a day. It’s kinda hard to remember how long this is going on since I usually forget about it until it happens again and I can usually only remember the last time or two it happened but I’d say this has been going on for about 5 years maybe. I think I remember telling someone about it 4 years ago but I couldn’t really explain what was happening and they just brushed it off like I was crazy or something. Any thoughts about what’s happening?",29Dec2019,2

3,"My aunt is prone to sudden outbursts of angry sounding yelling. To ask her a simple question usually prompts her to scream back some sort of  aggressive answer, acting defensive or as if she's personally offended by the question being asked and feels the need to snap back at you practically on the verge of yelling.

Example -   
Question: Hey, do you know if there's any good vets around here?  
Response: NO AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GO TO NO VET RIGHT NOW!!!!!  


All the while she gives you a death glare that looks like she's ready to fight you.  Here's the even more troubling part though.. She doesn't  seem to think or even understand that she is doing so. to tell her she doesn't need to yell will have her scream back ""I'M NOT YELLING!!!!"" 

Is it possible she has some kind of disorder where in her mind, she truly doesn't think she is being so snappy or have such a harsh tone with people? She is in her 50's and it seems like all my life, people have seemed to comment about her attitude and always being seemingly P/O'ed  about just about everything due to the way she responds to people. And of course she's in the mindset of herself always being the one in the right, with the rest of the world being the problem.

Back in the 90's she did reluctantly see a therapist (not about this issue) and was told she has a lot of pent up anger in her but she would just scoff at that.

Does this sound like a symptom that someone you may know has? Is there a name for it, for someone being of the belief that they truly don't sound as harshly toned as they do to you, to themselves?",29Dec2019,1

11,"On mobile, apologies in advance for the formatting. Female, 20 years old, have struggled with a number of symptoms my entire life. They all affect and sometimes restrict certain activities in my daily life. I’ve seen multiple therapists and doctors but have never gotten a clear diagnosis. Numerous google searches just give me broad, somewhat likely disorders and it seems like I have only one or two symptoms of most of them (OCD, autism, schizophrenia, etc). Here is a list of what I HAVE been professionally diagnosed with: general anxiety/depression, ADHD. Here is a list of what my mystery “symptoms” are: 1. I am incapable of completing a task/goal without an extremely detailed, EXACT step-by-step walkthrough of how to accomplish said task/goal. This prohibits me from completing a lot of work related tasks, as well as personal goals. 2. I can’t drive. I know it seems silly to list this as a symptom, but it’s like my body goes into anxiety overdrive and I physically cannot operate. I’m so high strung that I can’t focus on road signs, lights, other cars, etc. and when I realize this, my anxiety gets infinitely worse and I have to pull over immediately at the first chance. The problem is, most anti-anxiety meds limit or altogether diminish your capability to use machinery/drive. Is it really just severe anxiety, ADHD related, or something else? 3. I have fairly frequent paranoid delusions, such as being afraid of people watching me through windows, recording me without my knowledge, monitoring my conversations or phone activity, etc. They never go too far, and only really affect me when I’m alone, but they’re still frightening and cloud my thoughts making it hard to think about anything else. It could however stem from things I found out about during childhood- my father was caught stalking my mom at one point while they were married, and my older half-sister found a key tracer on her computer when she was a kid that only could’ve been installed by him (my dad is a mega techie, my mom is very tech challenged). If he took that measure to monitor his stepdaughter’s activity, what measures would he take to monitor his own daughter’s activity? I still live at home too, by the way, which probably heightens this specific paranoia. 4. This one isn’t as prominent or as severe in terms of complicating my daily life but might be important to the whole picture, but I’m very noise/touch sensitive. You know that feeling you get when someone leans in for a whisper, but you can tell they’re about to yell or scream just to mess with you? I have that sort of wincing feeling all of the time, and loud noises send me into a panic. Car horns, fireworks, guns, etc. I’m also very bothered by shirt tags and “pokey things” in my clothing/shoes. Please, if anyone has any idea of how I can manage and treat these symptoms, anything at all helps. I don’t need a diagnosis, but if someone or someone you know has experienced similar things and knows what can help I’d appreciate anything. My relationship is being badly affected by a lot of it, the driving part most of all, and I just feel extremely stuck in my life because I can’t get past these things and accomplish what I want to accomplish. Also please let me know of any more subs I should post this in that might be able to help too.",29Dec2019,1
12,"So the first semester of college is finished and i realised how much spare time I'm gonna have (besides studying for upcoming exams) and i dont know how am i gonna survive it.
Although I can say i have some friends, both from college and high school, i dont feel refreshed or better after hanging out. I just feel lonely and i literally count the hours from class to class so i can see people again. I feel like all my purpose is lost whenever I'm alone and it scares me.
I feel that if I'm not going to classes, or just going somewhere with some intended purpose, i feel completely lost and seriously alone, depressed and lonely.

Im already seeing a therapist but somehow we didn't really tackle this issue much, mostly because i always dissmiss it whenever im having a session.",29Dec2019,1
13,"For months I've felt worthless and hopeless about everything. I constantly look back on the past and keep wishing I could relive it, even for a moment, whether it was good or not. I'm overly attached to little moments and memories from as far as almost 2 years ago now, and due to this I haven't changed as a person. While all of my friends and people I know have moved on and enjoyed their lives I've been stuck reminiscing on the past and the things I've done.  

Around 9 months ago I tried to become closer with a guy I knew (second time trying, by the way, all my fault) and managed to screw that up again. I was too awkward and shy to actually engage in conversation with him and for the past several months the consequences have come back to bite me. Every day I've cried and have been feeling bad about it, feeling like I'm not good enough and like I'll never be as good as the people he's friends with now. What makes it worse is the fact that he was so accepting of me and that he wanted to be better friends too. It's all I think about, and I'm starting to believe I have some form of platonic limerence. I used to think that caring so much wouldn't affect me and that I'd somehow manage to get away with feel like crap all the time, but oh how I was wrong. That one issue has caused others for me, too. I think about all the other things I've done wrong and how many other people I could get to know if I wasn't so stupid and awkward. It's come to the point where I physically run from these things, and I get an extreme feeling of dread whenever I have to sit around him and other people. 

My best friend (who I'm starting to think doesn't want to even be around me anymore) is really close with him. Whenever me and her are talking and she sees him she runs over like she's just seen an angel. She forgets I'm even there. When I talk to her or text her, her replies are short and uninterested. All she can say is 'yes' to any joke I text her to try and make her laugh. I think it's because I'm always sad around her and other people. Because I'm quiet she always steals my jokes and doesn't let me say much for myself. 

The one friend who tries her best to help me shouldn't be. I tell her she shouldn't waste her time but she keeps refusing to stop trying to help me, and I guess I'm really grateful for that considering I can't tell anyone else I know about this, but I don't understand how she isn't getting tired of me like other people are. I don't want to go to school anymore and everything is starting to physically affect me. When I skip days off school I don't feel bad because I know I don't make a difference to more than 1 person. If I died I think only 5 people would actually care. I don't want to jump to conclusions and say it's depression because I do have moments where I'm happy, even if it's not for long. I can't be that bad yet.

I was quickly put on anti depressants, first one didn't work, the second one just took all my feelings away and left me empty so after a year on them I took myself off them.


In 2018 I came out as transgender mtf,


I don't know really, I just feel stuck, even though coming out was a relief within itself, some part of me thought it would solve all my problems. And it didn't. In a way it made me feel worse.


So I'm in this hole almost of disliking my body and dealing with my head, I can't seem to be happy for more than a few minutes, I'll distract myself all day to get through it, put on a brave face, but when I've watched every video and TV show or played my game, I'm left with who I really am and how I really feel.

I don't want to hurt myself, I haven't self harmed in 2 years.

But i don't exactly want to be here anymore, I can't find a job, I'm an embarrassment to my family, Christmas made that even more clear, I feel guilty for not having a job and being transgender and not being as stable as everyone else is. 

And honestly I'm fucking lonely, I want someone to hug every day but I simply can't let myself date when I'm like this.


Mum wants me back on medication, she thinks it'll help me get a job and ""start living"" but the thought of being numb is even worse than being depressed.

It feels like my brain cells die with every passing month. 

For some background info:
1) I’m not on any medication 
2) I’m not living with any pre-existing medical or mental condition
3) I’m not on the autism spectrum
4) I have never struggled with language, grammar or writing. 

This is all recent, and I’ve never experienced something like this before. I’ve always been exceedingly articulate but I feel like my brain is slowly eroding away and That it’s getting progressively worse. 

Can anyone here give any explanation to why this is happening to me? Or inform me about a test I could take to see if there is an actual problem? Or what kind of medical professional I should consult about this issue? Even telling me some advice as simple as just to read more often to or how to change my sleep schedule and why would be much appreciated.",29Dec2019,1

I have people I love who love me too and I could never put them through that. I’ve attempted several times before and I know the emotional toll it takes on people it’s not fair to transfer my pain onto others so selfishly. Yet I can’t shake this feeling that I don’t deserve to live. I hate that when I get angry and I realize I’m wrong and I just keep going because I can’t calm down. I hate that I misdirect my anger. I keep acting irrationally because of these heightened emotions. I feel like everyone else has a much better hold on their emotions than I do. If I even begin to cry it can last hours sometimes because I can’t calm myself. Everyone keeps telling me this is normal girl stuff but I don’t feel normal...I don’t feel like everyone else is experiencing this. Maybe thats because I’m selfish and I’m not realizing it’s normal.,29Dec2019,1

I completely stopped when I was around 5 and started realising what is meat and what is not. I am 23 years old now and I have no idea how meat tastes like. I've been struggling with paleness, tiredness and fatigue for ages now. I really want to start eating meat and fish, but it really doesn't look appealing, even thinking of putting it in my mouth makes me want to skream. The worse reason is that I just don't know why. Sometimes it smells good but not good enough for me to taste it, I don't mind eating stuff that was cooked with meat, as long as I can remove the pieces.

 I am struggling with having balanced vegetarian diet, although I rarely eat fast food, eat a lot of green veggies, soy, legumes etc. I rarely eat bread and pasta as weel. But I like my chocolate, a lot. I want to start eating meat, at least breast and plain ones without skin, bones, veins etc because of my health, my body is telling me something is off. I tried many things in my diet and never saw changes even after months. I don't think I'll ever be able to eat fish, can't stand the smell. 

How can I make myself to even taste it? I want to see if that is what is missing. It doesn't even make me gag because deep inside I know it won't end up in my mouth for sure so I don't mind looking at it, preparing it and touching it.

Worst thing is jokes on being vegetarian, and explaining why I don't eat meat and that I am vegetarian my whole life that I am aware of..

My friend has been struggling with mental problems for a while. He’s now on medication that’s supposed to help, and according to him it has. But today we talked and he said that he doesn’t feel right. That he feels good but also not at the same time. He doesn’t understand why, and allegedly won’t get an opportunity to tell a doctor until late February. The other concern is that, if he does ask about this issue, he’ll be sent to a hospital where he is treated well, but feels like he’s in a prison. This also puts a fairly big strain on his family apparently. The latest problem is something g he refers to as a “split” where he seems to start saying/typing things he thinks of, only barely able to stop himself when typing. During a “split” that occurred today, he sent a message I didn’t understand since it seemed to be referencing something I didn’t know. He had typed:

“Hah, that reminds me of the time I snapped, back when lunarc wasn’t in the meadow and gained Cozos wish, taking full control, even if it was only for a few minutes”

I wasn’t sure if this was a reference I just didn’t understand or a warning sign of something.

My questions are now:
Can I help in any way?
If I can help, what should I do or say?
What should my friend do?
Is the quote something I should be worried about?

50,"Today I started cleaning each room of my apartment, and I find that rotating rooms helps me maintain momentum between each room (instead of working on one room consistently). I tidied my kitchen and I started the dishes. I purchased a book that I've always wanted to read but have never completed (The Book of Five Rings for those who are curious). I cleaned myself up as well taking extra time to take better care of my appearance and health. I re-heated dinner and ate it in silence to just appreciate the moment instead of distracting myself with something else. I sat down and budgeted my finances so that for the coming couple of weeks I'll be able to spend appropriately without stressing about making it to my next paycheck. I wore a necklace I haven't looked at in ages and I bought myself an early birthday present without feeling guilty over it. I defended myself in a personal dispute between me and someone else which can be difficult for me.

While these all seem like basic things that shouldn't be celebrated; I got through it all without resentment or grief. I feel really good today and I haven't felt this good for quite some time.

58,"My best friend has been telling me he is going to kill himself soon and he doesn't know how much longer he has left. I need advice about what I should do to help him, I'll leave detailed information about the situation.

He has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD. His OCD is really bad and that is the main thing driving him towards this decision. In his mind he always has to do everything right and if he wasn't able to succeed in it at first, he goes back and redoes it until he succeeds in whatever he is trying to accomplish. We graduated high school in May and he had two dreams for high school: make it the best he possibly could and to have a girlfriend throughout it (he has never had a girlfriend before). He started a business in high school and started focusing on that, which took away time from him accomplishing his dreams. We ended up graduating and he was not able to accomplish these dreams and now he is obsessing over them, not being able to fix them. There was a time where a girl that he had liked also liked him and tried pursuing him, but he was obsessing over his business at the time and he didn't focus on her and now she is with someone else. He really likes this girl now and has for a very long time now and now when he sees her with her boyfriend, he wants to throw up and cry (her and the boyfriend have been together for over a year or so and have no signs of breaking up, at least any time soon). He has all of this regret on top of him and he feels since he can not fix these mistakes, there is only one thing he can do to make this pain go away, which is suicide. He is currently taking medicine for his depression, anxiety and OCD, and it works and he gets random spurts of happiness, but he still always feels the depression. He also thinks death isn't bad and has come to terms with dying, he thinks it's okay for him to go anytime now. He claims he doesn't know how much longer he has left and if he isn't able to get with this girl anytime soon, he will probably end his life.

I've tried getting him with other girls but he does not care for anyone else, he only wants this one girl. Also, he is already seeing a therapist but it is not helping him. Please private message me if you have any advice or any questions. I really don't know what to do and I don't want to lose my best friend. Thank you.",29Dec2019,1
59,"To keep things extremely short, I am having some relationship issues right now. It involves my SO, and his racist, emotionally abusive father. He dropped the N-word on Christmas (I am a black woman, and my SO and his family are white) and this was very difficult for me to deal with. It caused me to have to ask some difficult questions about my relationship, and how to handle this, as I've never had to deal with someone calling me this in-person, let alone dealing with the aftermath of this as far as how it affects my relationship. I asked for advice in a sub that I frequent, and some posters were very helpful -- they helped me realize that my SO needs to make a decision about whether or not he wants to stand by his abusive, narcissistic, racist father and still be around him while allowing him to not only slowly become abusive towards me, but his mother as well, or seek a therapist and start setting some bounardies and say ""no more"" to the behavior.

Originally, I was somewhat defensive -- as anyone that's been or know's someone who's been in an abusive relationship knows, this is pretty common. I've had to be on the giving end of this advice multiple times, and I know that you have to know when to be gentle and when to push. But after seeing tons of comments say the same thing, my opinion did a 180 -- I realized that I had to confront my boyfriend about his behavior, even if it means ending my relationship. This is extremely difficult for me, as I am NC with my abusive mother, which, my entire family sided with her after I did this, so I have pretty much no family, and I don't even live in the same state as any of them. Every Christmas, I also mourn the loss of my father, who died when I was 14 -- half of this stuff wouldn't even be happening if he were here. NOT TO MENTION the fact that my SO's father just really put an awful end to Christmas day a few days ago, and I'm still recovering from the shock that someone could be that mean and hateful. But I came to that conclusion and have a plan of action to move forward with, starting tomorrow.

But that wasn't enough. So many of the people responding in that thread treated me like I was a dumbass for staying around. ""You must not have a lot of self respect smh"", ""How could you stay with someone like that?"" Because of me continuing to get these comments, I actually put an edit at the top of the page letting everyone know that I've come to a conclusion that many of them were advising me on, and thanking them for their time. Still, more people came who didn't actually read that edit, who were basically berating me for not instantly knowing what to do in this situation. I finally told one commented ""Listen, all of the things you're addressing, I've already addressed in my edit. I am feeling really attacked right now and am feeling annoyed that I've already come to a conclusion that a majority of you guys are telling me to come to, and I'm still getting insulted. It makes me not want to ask for help at all."" Their response? ""Your boyfriend's dad calls you a n\*\*\*\*\* and THIS is where you draw the line?""

Even though I agreed with everyone. Even though I found a solution. Even though I got help. I'm still getting victim-blamed. Many of them were hitting me with Reddit's very typical, ""You should just break up with him"", and any attempts I made suggesting a course of action that led up to a breakup rather than me tapping my sleeping boyfriend on the shoulder and telling him to GTFO of our house and move out, I was getting insulted for. One commentor, because I didn't just agree to break up with him right now, today, started even going to other comments and telling people that I was a lost cause because I didn't want to do things her way.

It fucking hurts. That if you don't want to accept help the way people want you to, you're useless and not worth the time. I understand if someone keeps willingly throwing themselves into an abusive situation. I understand if someone comes to a subreddit just to ask for help, and rejects literally all of it. But I was telling someone that my view is already different than it was 2 hours before when I first posted it. Isn't that enough? ONE post isn't going to ""cure"" someone's problems. Not everything is, emotionally at least, so black and white that that person isn't going to have trepidation and need time to reflect before they come to an answer. Whenever a friend asks me for advice, I tell them what I think, and I give them a few days; I understand that they need to get advice from multiple sources, think things out, and sometimes they come back totally in my favor, and sometimes they come back 80% convinced, and have a solution that takes SOME of what I said. Sometimes, they're only 20% more out of the fog than they were before, but at least they're making progress. People were acting like I DESERVED what happened to me because I didn't get the ""obvious"" answer to the situation. 

This has been one of the most hurtful few days I've had in a long time, and one of the worst Christmases I've EVER had. I am in pain. But people are too busy telling me how stupid I am. I'm ideating, and while I'm absolutely not acting on it, this is the first time I've done that in months. All from asking a question. It makes me not feel like I can go anywhere to do that.",29Dec2019,1

They watched him, they fed on humans, they made him terrified.

His family didn’t know what to do. And one night he called the police and was so scared he had a heart attack. He was only 30. 

I feel sad because he was a great guy, we grw up together. His brother and I were close. I live my life based on the idea that every experience is meant to teach us a lesson or at least life can make sense for that reason.

I have anxiety, but I have been able to deal with it, grow with it, and never let myself be crippled by it for long.

It hit me hard is what I’m saying. It’s just fucking ridiculous. No one could help him. He was successful and had so many of the things most people could ever want. He didn’t die of cancer. He didn’t die of someone else’s hand. An idea killed him.

Anyway, once (possible trigger warning, bullying) I was doing the usual, getting changed after the lesson, and a group of girls start knocking on the stall door and asking “who’s in there?” I don’t respond cause I knew those girls weren’t particularly nice to me, so they keep knocking, and saying “HEY!! Who. Is. In. There?” I still don’t respond. 

Somebody says “I bet it’s ((my name” which starts everyone giggling and agreeing. 

They start kicking and bashing the door, and I stop what I’m doing (I think I was just getting my shoes on at this point) and lean on the door to make the bashing quieter (I don’t really like loud sounds) and they stop. 

About a minute later of incoherent whispering, I’m still leaning on the door and thinking “ugh, what do they want?”. I’m looking at the door, and I look away, then up and see someone peeking over the stall wall, presumably stood on the toilet. 

I don’t say anything, but I’m weirdly good at maintaining awkward eye contact, so I just kinda death stare at her for a second and she yells “IT *IS* ((my name!!” And everyone starts laughing and saying “we need to go” 

I yell “Nice violation of privacy there, ((peeker’s name!” 

I stay in the stall for a bit, knowing I need to go to my next lesson but still not going because I’m breaking down crying and overthinking, stuff like “what if she looked over five minutes before and saw you?” 

And this is kinda late in the post but I’m non binary (born female) and am very dysphoric, so I don’t like even the thought of someone seeing me. I go to medical, because my shoes that I were trying to get on were rubbing really badly and I had blisters (they’re doc martens that were generally new, so ouch) and needed plasters to help. 

I limp to medical with a tear stained face, and stay in there for a while, still crying. The lady asks “is there anything else bothering you?”

I shake my head, not wanting to talk about it.

I get sent to basically the school’s therapy kind of room, with mentors and etc. I write down what happened to the mentor I usually go to (I went to her last year for other issues) 

I still get changed in the bathrooms for PE, but I always feel like I’m being looked at and start panicking, looking up at the top of the stalls, but there’s nobody there. Even sometimes when I’m getting changed at home, into pyjamas etc I feel like the same girl’s staring at me.

67,"So I’m 14 (M) and I got some things I want to know about. Could you maybe help me identify what these things could be?

1. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts like how I could do it and all the different ways I could go about it. But I don’t think I would do it.  Also I don’t care if I die like I wouldn’t let it happen but I wouldn’t care if it happened
     2. My worst fear is losing some of my friends or family. Like this one friend I have we stopped talking for a bit awhile ago. We got back talking (Also we’ve been friends since kindergarten) but after we got talking again I didn’t want to lose her and I don’t  want to go a long time without being without her. But this feeling is like a lot of my friends and or family.
     3. Lately I’ve been I guess emotional idk if its just puberty or something else but I’ve mainly been getting angry. It can happen and I just lose my shit. But sometimes with my friend on PlayStation I don’t say anything I just feel it in my breathing and just as a whole. But with my family I just yell sometimes I say things I don’t mean but in the moment I mean them down to my heart. And sometimes this feeling of anger can last for awhile especially when its with my family.
    4. Sometimes I get really paranoid. At school when people are laughing or looking my way I think they are talking about me or making fun of me. I try to ignore it but it gets in my head. Or if I’m in public I think somebody is following me. 
     5.   Sometimes I can feel empty and like nothing is worth it. I just don’t feel like there is a reason to live (but i think that way all the time that there is no reason to live and everything ends the same way) 
    6. Its hard for me to tell people things. Im too paranoid that they will make fun of me for thinking these ways. I go through conversations in my head and see how it would go. I want to tell my mom about these things I’m saying in the post but like I’m said I’m to worried about what she would say like I’m crazy.

Now, I've never had a hard life. My parents were never abusive, I always had food and clothes. I had a pretty good life, but for some reason I've never been happy. The time is currently 2:16 am. I've heard stories of people waking up one morning and just realizing, they want to live, naturally I never believed it. But I'm laying in bed and I realized, I'm important. I'm worth it and I don't want to die. I have a reason, and whether or not there's a heaven or hell or a higher power. It doesn't matter. Because I'm here right now, I'm here for a reason. I'm loved by someone, I've helped someone. I've made a difference. And I hope by making this post I can help someone get a little closer to realizing the same thing.

71,"Hi! I am new here and I was wondering if anyone could help me with this. My younger sister is 18 and is currently struggling with **severe** PTSD and depression, all of which stem from major childhood emotional abuse and neglect. I am 7 years older than her and am the parentified child in our family. 

One of the most challenging issues that I keep coming back to is how she will say incredibly cruel things to me sometimes and will get angry with me over almost anything. Common topics from just today include criticism about me being single, my cooking, my thought processes, the way I tell a story to her etc. In certain obvious situations, I will jokingly make light of her criticism, showing how it is uncalled for or hypocritical, which she agrees with and laughs about too. That said, I don't think it's me projecting when I say that I think she seeks out opportunities to ridicule me. 

In more recent months it has gotten harder. Her remarks have become harsher and  nonstop. At this point I almost always expect a negative remark. It is hard to leave to do things together around family/friends or in public because she will do this in front of others and it makes people around us uncomfortable.

I am trying to be really supportive and, importantly, compassionate. I also think I am mindful of giving her space. We do not live together but text and call regularly. When we do plan things together, this is usually when this issue comes up. It's hard for me to understand because she will be excited about seeing me but then will act this way once the day comes around. I'm just feeling really drained from the pain of deflecting a lot of criticism. I have told her how I feel and asked her about why she is saying these things, which she has ignored or commented that I wasn't making sense.  

How can I be supportive to her and address this issue? Is there a general method for thinking about why she is doing this to me? I'd love to understand this more so that I can hopefully learn to become less hurt by it.

73,"I searched the forum and I couldn't find any cases similar to mine. This may not even be sex addiction but maybe someone can name what this mental illness is. 

I am a 20 YR old M who has been on tinder for about 3-4 years and have had about 6-7 flings from it.  I have had numerous matches but most of them I do not like except the very few. I have decided to get a ripped body so I started working out 3 months ago and I have been getting solid progress, and i'm guestimating about 3-4 months I'll be in great shape. 

However the problem is I think of sex constantly and it makes me sad that I'm not getting more flings or ""hot girls"" girls that are just fitter and have alright faces.  And when I mean sad I mean depressed. I know girls that are fit tend to go with guys that are fit for flings so this is why I'm trying to get a inshape body.

I jerk off around 2 times a day and look at porno twice a day or nudes.  But the main problem I have is I get pretty depressed oftenly that I'm not getting hotter girls or fitter girls constantly on tinder because to do that I know you need to be pretty fit for flings at least.  ( I have tested models and fit guys as cat fish so I know being fit/having a six pack greatly enhances your chances for getting sex"").

But yea my problem I believe is I get depressed when I cannot get girls I find hot which is basically ""nice body &amp; alright face"" of any race except white girls. (I'm white myself) 

Anyone know what I may have and what may help to not be so focused getting a better body and hotter girls? (I'm not looking for relationships just flings, so personality doesn't help me so much). I'm only willing to meet girls from tinder.",29Dec2019,1

-my emotions, although completely there on the inside, can't be brought to the surface as easily(except smiling, it seems to be my default and I do it regardless of whether the situation is horrible, not a situation that involves me therefore I shouldn't be reacting to it at all, or just nothing funny happened), I generally feel like I have a resting sad face (constantly have to force my face muscles to relax into a more neutral expression)

-I'm often zoned out while being sure that I'm paying attention (don't realize how long I've been staring at someone/something, suddenly realizing that everyone is staring at me waiting for me to get everything off my desk for a test I hadn't realized we were taking)

77,"I don't even know how to talk about it. Umm. Not sure why I'm writing here. My therapist and also doctor wants me to get a mental health assessment. I also just recently lost my job because fuck. I didn't communicate to my boss about trading days with a coworker and everything got fucked up. I have chronic mild pancreatitis and I had a stomach episode so I asked if I could come in late. Then, I assumed everything was okay and spaced out on even telling my boss about the day trading because she said as long as I worked it out with my co worker it was fine. Then we traded days and I didn't tell my boss. The next week my partner and I had a horrific fight. He was throwing my shit down the stairs.. I was crying bawling like a baby. I even have the fight recorded it was so bad. Anyways. Then I didn't sleep. I slept. 2 Hours. Woke up and couodnt move my neck. So I told my coworker I wasn't able to move my neck and that I was going to need some time before I got to work to be ok. Then she messaged me back and said she wouldn't mind working to make up for the missed hours. I was so exhausted and she seemed ok and then I literally passed out all day. Didn't tell my boss. Woke up to a text from my boss asking if I was working the next day. I said yes as soon as I saw the message but I was out of it still. Then I didn't communicate with her. Also the coworker I have had problems with since she started and somehow it all got turned on me. I have tried to be amicable and I apologized alot for anything wrong I did. I wanted to be friends. She is a therapist actually and maybe I just acted like an idiot because of that idk. Anyways before I got fired, I had began to question reality again and really fucking freak out. because I don't know why. I read this weird book and it flipped me out. This has happened before. I went off my medication a few months ago and have been having a hard time. My partner is also an alcoholic so just bad combination of everything. Umm so then I guess it matters I had childhood epilepsy which I've talked about before. And my birth mom has schizophrenia.  And I'm seeing a neurologist soon and also my primary doctor. It has been hard to get to the doctor because for car issues.  I think I have just been having some mental episodes for a while and now I've lost my job and it's not anyone else's fault I cried hard when she fired me and felt like a total asshole. I didn't mean to disrespect anyone and I understand it doesn't matter what I was going through I could have messaged my boss. She doesn't care about my life story or what I was dealing with she need a reliable person and I've missed alot of work due to my stomach and other issues. My therapist said I need a evaluation to be diagnosed but I haven't been ready for it I am pretty freaked out about it. It is one thing to have a therapist helping you. It's another to sit there and have someone judge what is wrong with you. I don't like feeling like something is wrong. I feel normal most of the time and sometimes have a hard time. Isn't that everyone? I guess everyone doesn't start to not understand reality and that is where the difference is. I have had to really work on knowing what is reality. For example the ground is real. Not every song has some meaning that is weird or like whatever. It's embarrassing to even write about it.

78,"(forgive me if I've made any mistakes with this post, or if I'm posting in the wrong subreddit. I've never used Reddit before until now)

For some background information on my mental health: When I was in Kindergarten I was diagnosed with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder), and when I was around 10-11 I was diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).


My parents never really believed in my Autism diagnosis and simply told me that, ""the doctor was crazy, and didnt know what he was talking about"". Therefore they just dismissed it and moved on, I tried to as well but I never could as it explained a lot of my behavior. Therefore why I'm posting here instead of asking an actual medical professional, due to my parents most likely not taking my worries seriously.

Recently I've told a friend (who's actually a certified professional in treating children with Autism) about my worries, which are that I'm unable to feel certain emotions such as empathy. I've never been able to truly feel empathy, not for others and not even for my own family members. I've never felt loss at funerals, and I've never been able to sympathize with my closest friend. I know how others should react to it, so for the sake of not being seen as insensitive all I can do is fake it. The best thing I can describe to what I feel when it comes to emotional situations is just emptiness, I just cant feel anything.

I'm also mostly unable to feel love, I have an amazing family who love, care, and have always supported me. But it's very difficult for me to love them or to show love towards them, It makes me very uncomfortable to show physical/verbal forms of affection towards them. 

The fact that I'm emotionally distant has caused me to become closed off with my family members to a certain point, and has made it difficult for me to form new relationships. I can feel other emotions such as frustration, happiness, and certain degrees of sadness. But I cant seem to feel empathy nor affection towards others.

My parents tend to blame my lack of empathy towards the fact that I'm an only child and am 'spoiled'. I don't think I am, but maybe that could be it?

I told my friend about this and she asked if I was diagnosed with Alexithymia, I said that I wasn't. But that response made me think about it, which brings me here.


So do I have Alexithymia? Is all of this just a symptom of having ASD? Or am I just a spoiled person who will (hopefully) eventually grow to cultivate these emotions?",29Dec2019,1

One day we will run into eachother and I'm going to be great. And hopefully by that point (whenever that may be) I won't care how he is. It won't bother me that he is with someone else, or that he treats her better than he treated me.

87,"Hello Reddit community! I'm an 18 year old female who has quite a question on my mind.
My whole life, I've been obsessed with certain fictional characters/cartoons. Usually, that fixation fades away as a child grows older, but it never did with me. I've never thought anything of it until now, with this specific character.
2 years ago, I got obsessed with a character named Gerald Broflovski from the adult cartoon South Park. I don't even know how it happened.. But I just started drawing him and my love for him has developed into a lot. I'm legitimately /obsessed/ with him. I made an Alternate Universe where he is severely mentally ill, which is something I did with a lot of characters for some reason. I draw him all the time, in fact he's really all I draw. I write about him, i roleplay as him and absolutely love to talk about him with other people.

Now y'all may not think that's weird because a lot of people do that, but here's where it gets weird. I've had actual fantasies about him, and feel severely attracted to him (sexually, too.) I daydream about him in class, I create stories with him as I try to fall asleep. He makes me happy and excited. I've never drawn nsfw with him, but I've roleplayed it and imagined it. 
Another weird thing is that while I love him, i would rather /be/ him than be in a relationship with him (though if I could only do the latter I would gladly accept.) I don't even want to be in a relationship with a real person because my attachment to him is so strong. Sometimes when I'm in a situation that makes me anxious or something, I pretend to be him. I don't act like him while in public or anything, I just act like myself but pretend people see me as him.

My mom is worried about me because she doesn't think this is normal at all, especially the fact I want to be/date him/am attracted to him.

I know its such an odd character to develop a fixation for, haha! 

Some additional information I'd like to add that might help with answers is that I have been diagnosed with ADD(now just ADHD, but I'm not so hyperactive), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and OCD. 
Currently, we are thinking I may have High-functioning Autism (aka Asperger's) that went unnoticed throughout my childhood. I share many symptoms with Autism, and I think this might be a 'special interest', but I'm not sure if this would qualify.

I’m the youngest of my brothers and for most of my life have been the subject of verbal abuse from him as I couldn’t help myself from getting involved when he would drunkenly argue and shout at my mother. My brothers always stayed away from it by locking themselves in their rooms and putting headphones on. This said my sober dad is one of the best people in the world which is how after all this time we are still a family living together after all the pain he has caused us all... but now all this drinking has caught up to him and I can’t handle seeing it. I find myself avoiding him completely even though I know he’s weak lonely and vulnerable. He has cuts all over his face and his body, he can’t walk, isn’t passing urine and can’t poo. I’m writing this as I’m waiting for the ambulance to come. I’ve never had anyone close to me die and I feel like I’m watching my dad slowly dying in pain and he’s suffering so much it’s so hard to look at him. My mother has been a nurse her whole life she comes home from long shifts and has to clean up after him and nurse him. I can see her genuinely losing sanity and feel I can’t do anything about it. He refuses to go to hospital (I believe because he is scared of the reality of his situation). Once the ambulance arrives and takes him this will be his first time speaking to specialists. Don’t really know what I’m expecting from writing this I’m literally clutching at straws for anything to keep me going. Feel so detached from life so emotionless while everything around me is burning. I’ve turned to drugs in some times over this period,  I smoke now (around 2 packs a week). Feel like everything is going to absolute shit. I used to believe in my younger teens that mental health was a myth and that people are attention seekers I can’t believe how wrong I was. This is crazy. I haven’t read this over I’m feeling some type of crazy way rn so sorry if I’ve repeated myself or spelt things wrong! I know if I read over it I’ll feel stupid and not post it.",29Dec2019,1
94,If I look at certain floor/carpet textiles it looks like to me that they are moving or dancing if I look at them for even one second. It makes me feel dizzy and i feel like I'm drunk. The same thing happens to the walls. This doesn't happen if the walls or the floor are a plain solid color with no designs or textiles . And at other times it feels like the walls are closing in on me and I freak out. Other people mentioned that this could be alice in wonderland syndrome but I highly doubt that since it's a rare condition. I currently live with my parents (I'm 18) so I can't see a specialist without them finding out somehow. Plus I don't want people to know I might me crazy.,29Dec2019,1
95,"The majority of people crank the handle all the way up in order to feel the warm water all over their body. But did you know that it's the last thing you want for a morning bath?! That's because morning hot showers can make you more sleepy  by relaxing your muscles.
So what you actually need is a cold shower. The ones you dread to take when you’re the last person to get up in the morning. 
What’s so great about cold showers?

Increased circulation is one of the top reasons why experts recommend cold showers. As cold water hits your body and external limbs, it causes your blood to circulate at faster rates to maintain ideal body temperature.

But what if you are already feeling sick?

105,"For when I was five until I was eleven this bitch molested me on about a monthly basis. My parents didn’t find out until I was thirteen because she used scare tactics to keep me quiet. 

I suppressed everything so hard that I couldn’t remember anything past my fifth birthday and the only reason I remember that is because is was the first time my dad kicked me. I will still have flashbacks of things I don’t remember until after the flashback, then everything about it will seem so hauntingly clear. 

This woman caused so much grief for me. When I was twelve I fantasize my own death, at one point considering killing myself. I remember feeling broken and dirty all the time and not remembering why. My first attempt was two years ago, on my 14th birthday. She sent a card, the first time she had contacted me in three years. I don’t know why it hurt so much to see her name on a piece of paper but it did, it hurt so much I tried to kill myself. I didn’t take enough to OD so when I woke up the next morning I had to pick up the pieces myself. 

This entire time my parents were getting worse. I wasn’t their perfect little Christian girl anymore. I was tainted. They found excuses to beat me, being so stupid as a call from the school asking if I was good or a B on a test. The summer between 8th and 9th grade is when I decided that god didn’t want me or didn’t exist. I was dealing with literal voices that no one heard. I was Seeing things no one else did. I thought it was demons because I didn’t know what schizophrenia was. 

When I tried again in January of this year I almost did it. I drank some peppermint tea, I’m deadly allergic to mint and its relatives. What I didn’t count on was my parents being able to find my brother’s epipens (bees). When I woke up they acted so concerned in front of the doctors. When the hospital recommended admitting me to a mental hospital and putting me on medication my parents refused. When I got home they were so mad. From that point on I never heard them say “I love you” again. 

Today brook, my abuser, showed up at the house. My parents let her in and treated her like nothing ever happened. When I saw her I snapped. 

I demanded to know why she was there and why the hell they were being civil. Turned out that my parents decided it was time to move past it. I yelled at them to remember what she did. They told me that god wanted me to forget and forgive her for it. 

The want me to forgive her for 6 fucking years of molestation, scare tactics, and mind games. 

They want me to forget why I want to die. 

They want me to forget the hell that bitch put me through every month. 

Just being around her makes me feel so gross and broken again. I can’t deal with this. It seems like the only way to get away from her is death. I’ve tried ant failed 4 times so far in life, maybe 5 is my lucky number.",29Dec2019,1
106,"Hello, I'm an 18 year old male and know i have an issue but don't know what or what to do. I'm never really happy, and am always disappointed/never satisfied with anything (social interactions, parties, holidays, Christmas, films, tv, games etc). I'm at a point where nothing brings me joy, even things that i once loved like skiing and gaming disappoint me and leave me empty. 

Even at times when i should feel happy, i don't; for instance i did well on my GCSEs and A levels and should have been happy but it didn't, maybe because i felt like i didn't deserve it as i barely studied for it (find it very difficult to concentrate) and saw people who i knew studied hard and tried but didn't do as well. Even when I'm being complemented it makes me depressed. I distinctly remember people saying i was really funny and one guy said i was one of the funniest people they've ever met, i reckon to most people that would put them on a high but that comment really messed with my head. Made me think of that sad clown paradox thing, me knowing that i can make others laugh and bring joy to them but can't find joy myself.

I just did my first term of university and was miserable and bored for all of it, finding it difficult to get out of bed, do the simplest tasks, and would find myself crying basically every day for no apparent reason. I really dislike it, and don't want to stay another 2 years as it will kill me inside, but i have nothing else to do, no direction in life, no aspirations, job ideas or anything. I feel like i don't exist, and don't feel alive.

To cope with it i delved into excessive drinking (resulting in a few hospital visits and casts), and am self destructive and start harming myself (like burning myself) so that i can feel something and feel alive for a moment. However the alcohol only gives me a brief moment of inner peace, before it gets me severely depressed and worse than before. I want to stop, have been told to stop by family and 'friends', but don't know how i'll cope without it. 

I don't really have any real friends, i never have. Im very cold and distant and don't get close to anyone, never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl despite having opportunities and offers. No one or thing intrigues me or engages me. I find myself constantly zoning out, wishing to be with anyone else, anywhere else all the time. People have started to notice how increasingly distant and disconnected i've been and starting to get concerned, but i always say I'm fine or just tired.

Parents, 'friends' and teachers have said my entire life (even more as of recent) that i may have ADD/ADHD, but i never got it tested as i didn't want that label, so i just ignored it. I've never talked about my feelings or mental health before my entire life but now I've reached a point where i feel like if i don't let it out, it will lead me to a dark place. I have no apparent reason to feel this way, I've arguably had a simple easy life facing no hardships or losses, i'm healthy enough, never been abused or bullied etc, yet i still feel empty and i don't know why.

I'm seriously considering dropping out of uni, packing my bags and getting the next flight anywhere with the little money i have, i need to find what makes me happy and i don't think i'll find it where i am right now. Sorry for the long winded vent, don't even know what the purpose of this post was tbh, just wanted to get it off my chest.",29Dec2019,1
107,"I get new year blues every year. Just before New Year, or at least on January 1st, I am reminded how little I have achieved, and how much pain and suffering I've been through, and how hopeless the next year is.

I've spent 5 years training for and working in a career that nobody respects. Six weeks before Christmas, my colleagues and I were given a 10% pay cut. I've gone from being barely comfortable to borderline poverty. The drop in my pay equates to a £20k drop in the amount of mortgage I can apply for - which in my city means that owning property has gone from something I was working towards in November, to something that could be a lost dream.

I'm stuck in a horrible flat - I don't have the money to pay a deposit down on a new rental now that my pay has been docked so severely. My flatmates allow the house to stink of dog piss, never do the dishes so I am left with nothing to eat off or cook, and I have given up trying to clean up after them. These people used to be my friends but The guy I was seeing ghosted me a week before Christmas and has just flounced back to give me a non-apology in time for new years so I might go and see him.

My mother let her husband terrorise and abuse me when I was growing up, and I've never been able to forgive her fully for it. My dad started a new family and he doesn't speak to me any more, despite multiple desperate attempts to get him to please send me an email first and check in with me. 

I was diagnosed with BPD and/or CPTSD a few years ago. I hoped the diagnosis would help - but in reality it slowed my path to help massively. I waited for treatment for almost 2 years before I finally got a therapist, who I see once every 2 weeks. I only have three more sessions left before I go back on a waiting list to wait for more treatment.

Everything feels so hopeless. I look back at my life and I've felt this way for a decade or more. I've had highs, but far more lows. I'm 26 and it feels like my life is just spiralling further and further downwards, and every day I stay alive is just one more day of pain and suffering with no end.

I'm alone, I'm lost, and I don't know what to do. God help me, I just want to feel like everything is going to be okay. I've told myself every year, this will be it - this will be my year. This is the year that things finally start going well for me. I'll find someone who loves me. I'll find purpose in my work, I'll finally make that breakthrough and be good enough at it that the people around me might respect me for the stuff I do.

114,"Since birth I have always been praised for being an obedient and well behaved child. Unlike most of my classmates, I was barely ever disrupted lessons or made noise during class. I just sat in my seat quietly, following the teacher's instructions. During family gatherings, I would be afraid of interacting with unfamiliar relatives and always hid in my bedroom, only coming out if it was really necessary.

My parents always remarked that I was just ""shy"" and said that I would eventually grow out of it. However, I never quite did. I still experience heart palpitations, sweating and panic attacks whenever I have to interact in social situations. I didn't dare to look my teachers in the eye when I talked to them, which made them think I was autistic. It has come to the point that even as a teenager, I am unable to even go out and buy something from a store. I have major difficulties in dealing with necessities like getting my hair cut, because I am constantly afraid of how to face my hairdressers, and whether they will be judging me negatively. Most times I literally just sit on the chair and wait for them to cut my hair, as they already knew what to do since I have already been with them for so long.

Even now I am having second thoughts writing this post, being extremely worried that readers will just think of how much of a disappointment I am for my age and laugh it off before downvoting it to oblivion. You are probably thinking, ""This person has a very low self esteem"". Well I was never formally diagnosed as having ""a low self esteem"", I guess it is not an invalid conclusion to make.

I have always felt a need to seek emotional validation from others. I constantly seek to be better than everyone else at everything, and become extremely dejected when I am unable to to the point where I completely lose interest in that field. I treat every single one of my classmates as a competitor that I need to beat, and I don't exactly know why. I find that I just have a subconcious distrust towards everyone and feel that everyone hates me or something. It's unhealthy and I know it but I can't seem to stop it no matter how I try.

Most people would be thrilled at the idea that someone else is sharing a common interest with them. I don't. I always feel a need to be special, and it's as if my personal identity is tied to my interests.

115,"Barely two days ago, returning from choir practice, I pulled into my yard. Within seconds of me turning the car off and opening the door, the first guy showed up with a gun. By the time he had snatched my phone out of my hand, the second guy appeared with his face covered, also holding a gun. They didn't threaten to shoot me verbally. I guess they felt showing me the guns was enough. I didn't have time to take my key fob out when this happened, so it was still in my car, along with my bag. I ran out and tried to get into my house as quickly as possible. I was still fumbling with the house key when I heard the car turn back on. They slammed on the gas to back out of the yard. That's when I heard what sounded like a gunshot. I panicked more, but got the door open and quickly slammed it in an attempt to keep them outside. I didn't realize no one was behind me. I screamed out for my parents who came right away.

Everything else for the next few minutes was a blur. I'm sure I had a full-blown panic attack (something I am used to, but not to this intensity). I just clung to my mother while my dad checked to see who was outside. I heard later that my mom yelled at him for going outside without knowing if the thieves were still there. They were long gone though. What was left was the wreck of a car they tried to take. You see, they didn't realize that the driveway and the entrance to the house are misaligned and promptly slammed into the wall surrounding our house. That was the gunshot I heard. They fled afterward with the car key and my phone.

The police came to the scene and took my statement. The family was immediately called and came over. My boyfriend was called as well, but he's studying in another country so he just stayed on call the entire time. Even my cats tried to stay around me. I guess they could sense something was wrong.  I am grateful to everyone who came to comfort and support me. Still...I can barely sleep. When I did sleep last night, it was because I barely slept the night before.

I have these flashbacks of being touched. Then I grew up and my mother was never around she always left me with family members and I experienced my first blackout. I just remember being in my grandmothers house and then suddenly I was outside with her. I remember the second black out more because I ended up in a different location.

For example: Smashing into a car in the other lane headfirst; someone breaking in and cutting my dog's throats; the feeling that I'm always being watched and that little lights I see are the lights of someone with a gun waiting to shoot me or tranquilize me.

I didn't want to go to a therapist because I feel crazy and I don't like to rethink these thoughts when trying to explain them.

The only people I think *might* be affected are my immediate family but my relationship is complicated with them. I've caused them more harm than trouble. I've already essentially sent my friends (who have already somewhat forgotten me and we'd already started to drift apart) some type of goodbye message saying I'm going off the grid without overtly telling them my intentions so as to not worry them. My only worry is that I'm being a burden to my family, but I'm more of a burden if I'm alive to be honest. There's no purpose for me on earth other than being a complete waste of time and resources.

134,"First, some context: I'm currently in a sticky legal situation which is preventing me from getting any work, and no relatives/friends that are capable and willing to house me until my ordeal is over.     
     
But to the meat of it: I've tried giving him a lot of chances. I understand he's been through a lot; losing his wife, losing his kids, life basically plummeting from okay to shit, but I've really just had enough. He's hurt me. A *lot.* Not physically, but emotionally. I'd argue that's worse, honestly. Even if it's the memories of an alter, the way he used to fight with his wife constantly still stick as memories that I subconsciously react to. That is, I can't function when anyone is being aggressive, and completely shut down in response to yelling. I can't help it, it's just an automatic response. Just a small part, though.     
     
I have a bit of a colorful mental health history. DID, Gender Dysphoria, Manic Depression (don't remember the clinical term for that), some form of amnesia, Asperger's, and PTSD which comes both from his mistakes and a slew of horrific experiences that have littered our life from early childhood to the current day. Frankly, my life has been hell.     
     
This all doesn't seem to matter, though, because I never got comprehensive therapy until maybe a year ago. Why? Because they didn't believe it. Previous host wanted to keep at least two of those problems a secret, but the rest was clearly on display. Especially the Asperger's. In fact, we were given a clear diagnosis of it very early on, but those two fools decided to completely ignore it. Now, unsurprisingly, my father completely and utterly refuses to do even the most basic, cursory research into any of my problems. He's the very religious sort and tries to act like an open-minded person, but fails miserably at it. It's progressively becoming worse as well, with him outright telling me that he's never going to call me by my actual name or consider me the woman that I am. He outs me in public at every opportunity, insists on speaking for me, and lashes out in anger if I correct him. If he tries to act like an actual dad for once and talk to me like a normal person, all of my points counter to his are denied. Something he's just factually wrong about? Not even a peer-reviewed study will convince him. Difference in opinion? Whoever shouts the loudest is obviously correct. I could go into more detail, but this is going to be long enough already.      
     
He doesn't seem to understand the DID, either. I've tried on multiple occasions to explain it, but he always misunderstands...well, all of it. Thinks by multiplicity, I mean change over time (""I'm not that person."" is taken to mean ""I have changed."" when in reality, the meaning is completely literal --- he doesn't comprehend that). When I try to explain the whole dissociation thing, he just acts like I spoke gibberish. Maybe I did, I don't know, I'm constantly having an out of body experience because I can't even stand to talk to him for more than a minute at a time. And the memory problems? He compares them to his going senile and claims to be the bigger victim, as if it's the Oppression Olympics or some shit. Does that with everything, really. No matter what hardship I face, he always claims that his is worse and that somehow invalidates mine? It makes no goddamn sense.     
     
Oh, and I won't forget how he literally called me a sociopath with no empathy right in front of me, to one of his friends. I'm almost certain it's due to the stereotype that autistic people lack empathy, which is completely false. But he won't listen to any of the dozens and dozens of articles and studies refuting that point because learning is apparently for sheeple.     
     
Oh, and the lack of personal accountability! Every goddamn time I try to clean his stupid, decaying mess of a house, he always manages to fuck it right back up in a couple of days. The kitchen is the worst part: Says he'll clean up after himself, then proceeds to hoard dishes with food, trash, and cigarette buds in them until mold starts growing. Every time he attempts to cook, he inevitably fucks it up and makes a mess in the process; I have to waste half a roll of toilet paper just wiping down and polishing the stovetop because he can't stop spilling fucking grease and sugar onto it. That thing is so filthy that I'm afraid to lay utensils on top of it. And when I tell him to clean up after himself because I can barely even take care of myself? ""Like I haven't cleaned up messes."" is his response, in the most passive-aggressive tone imaginable. Yeah, you have, but you also cause the majority of them. And no, taking care of someone because they're incapable of doing so themselves does not entitle you to making them your servant.     
     
Trust me, if I could do it with any degree of success, I would go out and start stockpiling money right now so I can leave --- but I can't. And besides, even if I were, I know he still wouldn't do it. I mean fuck, I'm depressed too; both of our lives are shit, but the difference is that he's just lazy as hell. And besides that, he doesn't have to tackle with the prospect of having his entire life ruined to the point that suicide would be a mercy. I DO. I mean fuck, he doesn't even work, he just either lies in bed all day and demands things or goes out to do whatever probably illegal hustling he must to at least keep the lights on. That's another thing he'd have to do even if I weren't here. Situation for him wouldn't change much. There'd be very slightly more food in the refrigerator, would live completely alone, and maybe have enough for a little more drugs. I really can't imagine that's worth losing your only remaining child over. Especially given the fact that he's alienated himself and me by proxy from the entire rest of the family already. You'd think the rest of his kids betraying and abandoning him would be a wake-up call, but I guess not. Newsflash, fucker: Those who burn bridges will go nowhere in life.     
     
So that's all the bullshit he does. Well, most of it. Most recently, I've just about had it. He's gotten far more passive-aggressive. Well, at this point it's aggressive-aggressive. Woke up this morning and immediately started yelling at me, then stepped on the cat and yelled at it. The other day, he forced me to actively manipulate somebody into giving us money or be kicked out. I can't even focus on my personal work anymore because every time he speaks, I start having an anxiety attack. I sleep all day and am only up at night not just because I prefer that type of schedule, but because I can't stand to be awake at the same time as him. I'm constantly afraid that he's going to get and just come in and start screaming and bitching at me. It would be bad under normal circumstances, but the fact that it triggers the PTSD is what kills me most. I can't even remember how many times he's lashed out and then apologized for it later; and I fell for it each damn time. The fact that he knows the problem and won't change hurts more than every break-up I've ever had combined, worse than my own siblings throwing me to the dogs for personal gain like they did, and almost as badly as whatever the hell caused the DID in the first place. I can't even rightly remember that event, and I still think it would be less painful than this.     
     
Fuck. I don't know if I can take this any longer. I know I'm going to off myself in the next year depending on how bad things get, but this makes me think it might be better to just do it early. I know that's fucked up, but what choices do I have? Suffer or die? It's not even myself that I'm worried about, it's all the other people who care about me far more than this asshole ever has. I know they would be devastated, but I don't think it would be worth it for me to endure this potentially long-running shit anyways. Because even if I do, there are still at least three other major hurdles I have to get over. I don't want to hurt them, but I also can't endure this and come out sane on the other end.     
     
This situation is beyond fucked up, and I really don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm just venting or asking for advice. Maybe both. The latter would be appreciated.",29Dec2019,1

138,"Hi,

So for background I'm a 25 y/o male from England who is diagnosed with chronic depression and borderline personality disorder and an indication of Ptsd which I am awaiting diagnosis for. 

For a few years now with increasing occurance I have at times become very confused about my surroundings in terms of what other people have said, when they said it and what tone/emotion they were saying it to me with which I have then often abnormally reacted to with defensiveness and not uncommonly aggressive/petty behaviour. For example I have perceived a family member saying to me that i am "" horrible, shit and in need of therapy"" which I have then reacted to with "" How could you say that, you are the one in need of counselling"". They have then told me that it was me who said the original comment.

The situation that has led me to make this post is similar but more destressing in how it unfolded. Me and my partner were being intimate where when I started to slow down, I heard my partner say (in the most spiteful/ cruel way I could perceive it) ""Tired?"" with a smug face to boot like as if I was disappointing her. I then felt very hurt and immediately stopped saying ""nevermind then"" and shutting down, getting dressed and going downstairs to make us both a brew and cigarette whilst she pleaded with me to tell her what was wrong. I thought she was realising what she had done and panicked. Upon returning to her side I  curled up and did not move or say a word for two hours which to me was maybe 10-20 minutes at best.

After a while we talked about what happened and she told me that that was not the series of events as it happened. I had out of the blue during sex said ""nevermind then"" and preceded to do the above/storm off which hurt her greatly and left her very distressed and upset especially with me coming back and saying nothing for the two hours. 

I was adament that my version of events was the correct one until I thought it through and remembered that this wasn't the first time I've been similarly confused and reacted very abnormally.

I trust my partner 100% (when I'm thinking with clarity) so I believe her now when she says that is what happened.

I am still so very confused at how this could of happened. How could I have reacted like that before she had even said the thing that I perceived as being so hurtful and thus justifying my reaction? 

I'm sorry if this is more belonging in r/relationship advise but with the level of mental health issues that I have I didn't feel it would be appropriate there.",29Dec2019,1

I want to start off with one of the closet people in my life, who convinced me to go seek help and to get started on my road to recovery. It has been hard and things a lot of the time seemed gray and even hopeless, but that same person was always there for me. Even on days that I became too much to handle, they were there. I will keep their name quiet because I don't have permission to post their name on here but, I wanted to still at least give them the recognition they truly deserve. I've had so many people in my life that have turned away when I confronted them that I was struggling and that I needed help, and to my surprise, this person didn't.

She’s just waiting for the rope to arrive. She literally never listens to me or the other mod no matter how much I try to beg and comfort and rationalise and get her to reconsider.

155,"I’ve posted here a while ago about finally going to a psychiatrist. I’ve been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I’ve been using prozac for a month now, i was feeling fine for a while. It did fix the issues i had with over reacting to things, however the problem now is i just don’t feel anything at all? Like im completely numb. I still think about suicide every single day, and now compared to before i don’t feel scared of doing it. I can %100 say that im only here because of my mother, to not make her sadder than she already is. However i just don’t see the point of life anymore, like generally. Its such a weird thing, at this point im nothing more than a robot. Today for example, i was thinking about these things and i just started crying but i swear on my life i didn’t even feel sad? Its killing all the hope i had for things to get better, i legit did not accomplish ANYTHING and everything is still the same. What more can i do? Im already exhausted every single day and trying to get better makes me even more tired that i sleep +10 everyday.  Also like im just 44 kg now and im 165. Everything is going downhill.

156,"I let it go, let it go, let it go. So sometimes a shadow moves when it shouldnt. Sometimes I'd hear a few soft indistinct voices, nothing troubling I'd say. 
It got worse and worse. Then the self isolation hit. I'd hide away from my family in my bedroom or bathroom. Soon it was whole days sitting alone while my family went out and lived. Then I got angry at them, at me...
Then I got mad that my wife of 20 years sent shadows to harm me. (I realise how that sounds now) So I obviously demand a divorce, pack my things and leave.

I'm in the hospital now and getting help. Thankfully she said she'll wait for me.

159,"Hi guys - I wonder if anyone else has experienced this. My mood tends to be relatively good; I have ADHD so any period of anxiety tends to correspond with a loss in focus or just planning ability.  


Every single time after I eat (doesn't matter time of day, amount of sleep, carbs/no-carbs) where its over 500 calories (or such) within 15 minutes I feel sleepy, incapable of focus, and just feeling negative about things. If I'm working on a project for work and the feeling before hand is ""wow this is really exciting, I'm getting this done"" immediately after, without any other impetus those feelings shift too ""I am unable to get this done. I can't read. This is going to suck"".

160," After  graduating from high school I got suddenly a sleeping problem (i  am too  sensitive for smells) and because of this i sleep bad. Because  of this I  am socially too exhausted to do shit and thus I sheltered  myself from  other people, without any social friends to hang out with.  Other than  that, I am a good looking guy, had several jobs and am on  the edge of  finishing law school. I've met people, but never been to  dating. I've  just turned 25, and until that point I thought that as  soon as I fix my  ""problem"", I'd start living an actual life. Now  though, I feel like this  may not happen and my life is slipping away  from me. 

i have no idea how to live with this. i'm totally dependant on other people washing my bed sheets to have a comfortable sleep, and i can never enjoy a good sleep. i'm 25 and it's like i have wasted the last 8 years to panicking and feeling shit over my problem and how it affects my sleep and therefore life quality.",29Dec2019,1

My parents hate me because I had schizophrenia a few years ago. I have all the negative symptoms like anhedonia and flat affect, and nobody wants to be my friend. Going out is pointless. I work as a slave at a gas station for money that does nothing but perpetuate my useless life.

I haven't had hallucinations since I was hospitalized at age 17, but I get delusions that I was aborted as a fetus and I'm actually living as a spirit in some layer of hell. I recognize it's a delusion, but I still have a strong emotional reaction to the idea like I know in the back of my head it's actually true despite logic telling me it is not. It's like how some self-hating gay people can be the biggest homophobes you'll ever meet. They're telling themselves lies to cover up how they really feel.

I don't know if I should just kill myself. I sob for several hours a night thinking about it. There is no future for me. I couldn't get back in college even if I some clear goal that required it, which I don't.

163,"I don't even know why. I've been digging stuff up trying to get to the root of my problems for the past few months, and I've been super up and down lately. When I unravel some past trauma, it seems like a weight has been lifted off my chest and I have a really great few days. But then it's like I become aware of the void that's left by uncovering this stone and I feel way worse later in the week. 

Last week I finally had a breakthrough in confronting my parents about things I've been trying to get across for years, and it felt like the first real progress towards healing our relationship. 

But now I feel more depressed and anxious than ever before, it feels like by digging this stuff up...on one hand I got some much needed venting and closure, but it almost seems like my personality/stability has been unravelled? Like over years I built a stable sense of self on top of these buried issues, but now that they're uncovered I'm on a shaky foundation and I regret even touching it. 

I feel like I remember reading something along the lines of when past traumas are dealt with it leads to greater instability and depression in the short term but better well being in the long term. Am I making that up? If it's true, what's the best way to get through the short term negative effects? Leading up to this, I had been journaling, which led to the same cycle of feeling relief &gt; feeling worse &gt; feeling better, but in the moment I'm feeling too unmotivated to do anything. Literally feeling like there's no point to anything.

167,"Although I am constantly doing things, always busy, overworked and have more friends than I can count, I am often feeling like I'm not enough. 

This possibly stems from my naturally extroverted personality, as I've always just defaulted to wanting to be around people, wanting to talk, etc. Further, as a young child, I always had trouble making friends with other kids because I was such a strong personality but I had no issue being friends with adults. This left me feeling rejected for much of my life. Then, when I became a teenager, the whole dynamic shifted and I've been surrounded by deep, meaningful relationships ever since. 

All that said, I have always had such trouble coping with new environments and dealing with the inevitable unthreading of a friend group or friendship. I have very few friendships that have ended on bad terms, but many just come apart because circumstances change and life goes on. Currently, I have way more relationships than I can even keep up with, but I'm always looking for more. 

I also want to say, I am reasonably confident and content with who I am as a person. I have done a lot of work to come to appreciate my body and love myself, and I really do enjoy my presence and love who I am. I also am now able to have alone time, where that was a huge issue for me in high school and throughout college. 

I have two jobs, live in an apartment with my best friend, have another best friend I work with, have a great family and support system and I have goals I'm currently setting and working on for the future. (I am processing some grief with the end of a romantic relationship, but I think I'm doing rather well with that and I don't think it has to do with my feelings of inadequacy so much as it's a tough situation.) 

But it always feels like it's never enough. I live in a metropolitan area now and I think subconscious ""me"" is wondering why I don't know more people around, don't go out more, don't meet more new people. I always crave new people, which I think is a big reason I have so many close friends. 

I also have been staying away from social media a lot more since the fallout of that relationship I mentioned (I realized I was posting stories only because I hoped he saw, and how that wasn't healthy), so I wouldn't even say I am comparing my experience to others, either. 

TLDR:

The best way I can explain it is this: you know how, when you have constant notifications on your phone, you don't really notice or appreciate how much people are interacting with you, but when you have none, you feel empty, like no one wants to be around you? Well, similarly, if I'm doing something AWESOME -- traveling somewhere new, living abroad, having an adventurous night out, catching up with a great friend, I feel happy about that but the feelings of inadequacy are still humming under the surface, and then when I have nothing to do, I feel the inadequacy much stronger.

171,"I haven't been on reddit in over a year, so please excuse any bizarre reddiquette while I'm here.

Backstory: I've been taking 100mg Wellbutrin SR and 5mg of Lexapro together for 2 years. Before, I took Lexapro on and off for several years. The Lexapro never did much until my doctor paired it with the Wellbutrin. I have Persistent Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety focusing on Social Anxiety and Phobia. 

I love Wellbutrin, and have been on both for about three years now. Lexapro came into the mix to lessen some of the ""jitteriness"" of the Wellbutrin, otherwise I would just be taking the one for depression. The problems I've had since I started taking Lexapro is the same ol' story; **disheartening sexual side effects and weight gain**. I was always a solid 127-130lbs, perfect for my height and build, but now I'm teetering close to ""overweight"" on only 5mg. It seems that at 5mg I shouldn't be so dependent on this drug and should just be able to stop taking it? Tapering down to 5mg then quitting is generally the goal of most doctors starting to taper you off. However, I have tried to simply stop taking it, like everyone says I should be able to, but the anxiety, depression and rage come barreling back by day 7. I know these are withdrawal symptoms and not relapse, but I just can't get over the hump. This last week was the third time in 2019 I tried coming off Lexapro. I know, Christmas week was a terrible idea, but with my weight only spiraling more out of control, I was hoping to curb my appetite some before being around all the food. 

Today, after an argument caused by increased tension between my partner and I, I couldn't take it anymore and popped the pill. It's beyond frustrating. I'm on such a tiny dose that doesn't have an effect on most people, and every doctor says I should just be able to stop at this point, but I can't. 

What am I supposed to do? Should I try cutting the 5mg tablets into 2.5mg halves and take those for awhile? Several people on another forum mentioned taking a pill every other day, then every three, and so on until you're off it. This makes me nervous though, because with the half-life of Lexapro, it seems like making your intake inconsistent could do more harm than good. Should I reconsider the Wellbutrin as a cause of the anxiety and rage?

I call this the problems of the 1%. Growing up as a (moderately) rich, white male I very quickly realized that I had no ""real"" problems and that I wasn't allowed to complain about anything, because my problems were 1% of EVERYONE elses. 

I felt like I should have 0% to complain about. Instead, I actually had 1%.. Seems manageable though, alt least that's what everyone tells you.

After a while though, that 1% starts to look really big, but still nothing compared to the 100% that everyone else has.

I know you would ask me to visit a therapist but I cant at this time because waiting lists are very long.

1.Sensitive to criticism: I realized that I am very sensitive to criticism. Especially if its related to my job. One of the reasons is that I fear losing my job. When I graduated I had a lot of trouble finding a job. I used to be one of the toppers of the class and my peers always told me that I am not good enough. I was fired from one of my temp jobs as well.

2.Insecure/Paranoid: This is also related to my job. I am very insecure and often have paranoid thoughts about people talking about me behind my back. It brings me a lot of stress. I also get paranoid thoughts on my contract renewals. It got worse when they ended my contract at my last job after they had given me excellent feedback(So after their lie I feel like people lie to me at all companies)

3.Anger/Rage: I had this my entire life. I get really angry really quickly and sometimes get high blood pressure. I have trouble forgiving people. Probably because I had a crazy father who screamed at me and beat me every chance he got.

4.Social anxiety:I have social anxiety to the point where one bad social encounter ""ruins"" my weekend. Because I would keep thinking about it. I feel anger/frustration/shame. Thats why I avoid going out for shopping and get home delivered groceries. I wake up 6 in the morning to throw my trash so I dont get a bad comment about the smell of my trash.

5.Reputation: I am too much worried about the opinions of others. It will hurt my ""reputation"".If I get fired then what will people say?

My dad gets mad at me for the SLIGHTEST sign of me being down. I try my best to act happy around him I always compliment him, I fo everything he does, but it’s never enough. If he ever catches me off gaurd being down he’ll yell at me for being “depressed”

My dad does have of family having mental health issues though, he had diagnoses manic depression, and so does his mom and most of his extended family. His mom was depressed most of his childhood and even tried to commit suicide right in front of him, so I can sympathize with him.

Usually when I wake up in the morning he’ll be like “So you’re depressed again huh?” Which I’ll be putting on my happy face usually when he says this.

Also he gets mad at me for saying the medication is making me feel worse and making me have suicidal thoughts, he’ll tell me I’m “bullshitting”

Also I wanna point out that my dad is not really the BEST dad, he’s psysichally and mentally abused me most of my life. When I was 13 he threatened to disown me for losing a 20 dollar bill.

NOW I'M SCARED TO EVEN LEAVE  
I MEAN IF YOU TREAT ME THIS WAY HOW WOULD YOU TREAT PEACE?  
NO ONE ACCEPTS MY GIFT, RESPECT PEACE CALM, YA I WAS HOLDING A BONG, I JUST LIT UP IN THE PUBLIC POTTY TRYING TO GIVE A PIECE OF THE PIE TO ANYONE WHO CRIES. Y'ALL REALLY SHOULD TRY HANDING A LIT JOINT TO A CHILD THAT JUST FELL DOWN AND CRIES? THEIR EYES POP OUT OF THE SOCKETS AND KNOW DAMN WELL WHO I AM. I WILL STICK MY LIFE OUT ON THE LINE TO STOP A CHILD FROM CRYING. I WOULD HAVE SO LOVED TO HAND THE OTHER GIFTS THAT COME WITH PEACE OVER TO THE WORKING CLASS KIND, WE ALL WORK, MEANS EVERYONE GETS TO LEVITATE, I MEAN COMMON, WHY GIVE MORE TO THE RICH AND STUPID AND KEEP THE BEST TOY IN EXISTENCE AWAY FROM A 30-YEAR-OLD VETERAN TRYING TO FIND HIS CREW. WE UH HERE TO SOLVE THE CLUE. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HANG WITH ALL OF YOU BUT ANKLES ARE SHATTERED BRICKS I CAN BARELY WALK. DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME KIDS: JUMPED A 10 FOOT FENCE, NO SOLES ON MY SHOES TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE CHILDREN OF EXISTENCE I TRY TO BRING MY GIFT I FALL OFF-GRID. FOOD OF ANY KIND WILL SAVE YOUR LIVES TODAY AND YOUR SOULS COME WITH I.T.

HOW do CIVILIANS EXPECT MILITARY SUPPORT WHEN CIVILIANS ONLY RESPECT OUR JOB 1 DAY A YEAR. THAT GIVES CIVILIANS 364 DAYS TO STICK IT TOO US AND LAUGH ABOUT IT THE FOLLOWING DAY? PEACE IS SO FUCKING ADVANCED Y'ALL KEEP WALKING AWAY FROM ME. MOST HIT THE GAS AND BLOW BY ME. YA UM HOW IS GOOD EVIL DOWN HERE? I MISSED THE MEMO WHEN SOME IDIOT BLEW MY CROWN OFF. IR-REPAIRABLE DAMAGE DONE TO DELTA. THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT I DO, SAVES LIVES. THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU DO: STEAL ANYTHING AND NOT THANK THE RIGHT GUY FOR I.T.

Y'ALL THANK A WALL WHILE LOOKING AT SOMEONE NOT STANDING THERE. Y'ALL CALL HIM JESUS CAUSE HE'S EASIER TO MURDER

WHAT AM I WAKING UP TOO?

i have issues with guys sucking off other guys, thats where technology comes from and guys and drinkin it too? yuck what the fuck, do your guys dicks get stuck down there and make the sucker stay a play a while longer too. eeew  
I don't want you sucky sucky nom nom twits showing that to children don't want any bright ideas this is heaven again. that shit aint never the same fucking thing. in all honesty when we go to hell we just lay (lleh) there and nevaeh (never) worry about repeating this process. I woke up, didn't mean too, kinda missing a few notes hard to focus on the starving mind. the ability to trust anyone, nill. i do not do stupid. i am HIGHLY allergic to anything stupid. my mind is kinda in trouble with malnourishment. tend to say stupid things trying not to look stupid about it. don't whine to me if you can't read plain English or at least learn to decode simple",29Dec2019,1
192,"I  have a problem where I start overthinking i guess. Like say I get kinda sad when a person that talks to me a lot suddenly stops talking to me as much and starts talking to other people instead, in turn I get very sad and get anxiety about it. Any advice",29Dec2019,1
193,"I was often really tired as a kid too. Now it comes back again. Loosing my will to live. I don't want to live my life like this now, being tired all the time just struggling to find a reason to not kill myself. At least as a kid I didn't knew anything better. I feel so lonely and struggling to connect. 

Been bullied a lot so I don't trust local people here from my home town. The terrors are still tormenting me at night. I can't find no other people I can connect with anymore. I feel like such an unloved fuck up. 

My parents love me but I believe no one else truly does. My parents are the only reason I live, if I had it my own way I wouldn't go on anymore.
Sorry mom and dad :(",29Dec2019,1
194,"I think i am having anxiety attacks, ill suddenly begin to feel like i can't Breathe, i start crying and hyperventilating and it feels like i just fall into a black hole and can't get out. How do I avoid this happening? It happens at school a lot and Im scared people will notice, can i do anything to make it stop? (apart from therapy )",29Dec2019,1
195,"So I got divorced this summer after 7 years together and 4 years as married. The 2 past years have been hard. On top of that work has been stressful. The relationship was toxic and abusive but it took a long time for me to see it and accept that I needed to leave. 
Now Im struggling with anxiety, loss of appetite, struggle to fall asleep, regular stomach aches and occasional suicidal thoughts. I feel like Ive lost myself in the process of leaving. Im also constantly drained and dont have the energy to do things I enjoy. 
I talked to my doctor about it and that I fear Im burning out but they didn't take me seriously. Said that I was just struggling to deal with a crisis because of my young age (Im in my 20s). They gave me an appointment with a therapist to talk to but I feel like I'm not being taken seriously and getting the help I need. 
Im just so tired and just want to live without anxiety on a daily basis.",29Dec2019,1
196,It’s winter break and i’m out of school for a while. Whenever i’m in school i’m a sad excuse for a human and do literally nothing. Now that it’s about a week after break started I can just relax and chill and do nothing.But for some reason i just feel so guilty. Just so guilty for not doing work i don’t have. I have zero homework due in the first week when school starts again and have no chores to do around the house and yet i feel so bad just laying down and relaxing. It’s weird bc during school time that’s all i want to do and i only feel a little bit of guilt doing it. I feel so bad that i’m just always on the verge of tears and i’m getting mad so easily.,29Dec2019,1
197,"I’m writing this to see if I’m the only one feeling this way, it started around the same time (a little later) after I wanted to kill myself which I’m not sure if that matters or this is some form of disorder/illness. It didn’t have to be that challenging at all even things from washing the dishes and tidying up were annoying even things I used to enjoy like Christmas gifts for example, I hated having to look for them, I hated having to leave the house on Christmas. 

(Sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors I’m not the smartest)",29Dec2019,1
198,"I've been struggling with depression and a sheltered life for a while. The problem is I want to hangout with my friends, take arts &amp; crafts classes, ski, fish, hit the gym, etc. but I don't have the money nor transportation to do so. I can't drive yet because I still have to wait until my doctor signs the friggin' paper and since I'm still going to be taking the Septa to my school, it is cheaper than driving and maintaining a car. I'm unemployed, didn't get accepted to any new jobs yet, and my family is unwilling to pay for any of those. I don't really have much of a support system, especially since my limited access to therapy is like every other week. I'm not the most social person, as I am shy around people I don't know well and have Asperger's, which is why it's hard to make friends online. So far, the only people I talk to are either busy, too far, or toxic. My college friends or 2 high school friends I still talk to are too far and the people I met online are either that or toxic. Also, I'm single which is why these depressive thoughts aren't going away. I feel like shit most of the time and start to question the point of life.",29Dec2019,1
199,"I am seeing a therapist for half a year approx. and I actually feel worse, not because we are digging into my miserable past and that this would hard on me or whatever but because (at least that is what I feel like) we are going in circles.
I am telling him xyz about myself and he answers with ""Well in theory people need this and that and behave like this and that"" and he once said that I am ""a very interesting case, so interesting that you would be a great case for research"" which sounded like he thinks I am talking shit...  I think he wants to be transparent and wants to explain things and I told him that this makes me so damn angry but he still does that. 

Maybe someone was in a remotely similar situation and can give me some advice on the question above

(I am sorry if my english is not the greatest, I am german)",29Dec2019,1
200,"It doesn't bother me per say, but I wonder about this. I have a friend who will check or seek reassurance for things they don't need to. For example, I texted them today asking if they were busy and they responded that they ""Have family friends over they don't get to see often and want to spend time with them, is that okay?"" If I was in that situation I would simply say I had plans. 

Being over text, I asked if they were asking in an annoyed/sarcastic tone (we're close) because they definitely don't need my permission. They responded they weren't annoyed at all and had just wanted to check and be sure it was okay. Why do they feel the need to do this and how can I be supportive? Sometimes I second guess myself and wonder if I'm unintentionally controlling, but I've come to the conclusion that they do this because of something to do with them and not me. I reassured them that they don't need to ask my permission for anything unless it directly impacts me somehow.",29Dec2019,1
