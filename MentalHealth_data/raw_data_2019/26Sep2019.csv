1,"I went to the ER because I was hurting too bad to move, too bad to take care of my son properly. After multiple blood tests, a pee test, a CT scan, and three x-rays they diagnosed me with Gastritis. Stress-induced gastritis.
Gastritis is basically what happens when parts of your stomach and intestinal tract swell. The medicine I need to control the pain is so expensive. I can't afford to buy the medicine, out gas in my car, and but my son his essentials. The morphine is starting to wear off and I'm in so much pain and I don't know what to do.
The doctor told my to avoid stress, how the hell is a young mother, nightshift worker, college student supposed to avoid stress? I also have to take off work for a recovery period and financially I can't do that. But physically I can't work. I'm stressing ocee money, I'm stressing over how to care for my son, I'm stressed out over everything about this situation and I really don't know what to do, my anxiety is kicking in and I'm terrified about the next few weeks of my life.",26Sep2019,1

4,"Sucks. Consistantly feeling like I'm a failure. Consistantly feeling like I'm hurting the ones I love. Seeing you're at fault when it comes to them being sad. Already feeling like you're at fault with everything and fuck everything up and seeing first hand how much they despise you just makes it so much worse. You see what you put them through, you try to change it but your always sad and thinking the worst. And knowing how they see you and how they feel about you, makes the depression so much worse.",26Sep2019,1
5,"Hi. Let me preface by saying that I'm 15 and am limited to writing this post on my phone so I apologize for any grammatical errors and formatting issues.

Before we get into anything, I need to explain my background. I was born in the Philippines, lived there for roughly three years before my mom met her ex-husband while she was studying in Thailand and we moved to the United States. For eight years, we lived with her ex-husband in New England. For eight years, me and my mom endured cruel abuse from her ex-husband before we found the chance to flee.

I can't speak of what he did to my mom as she's never disclosed that information to me, but I got sexually and mentally abused by this man. My childhood was stolen from me. He breathed down my mom's and I necks and even stole money from her paychecks to add to his cigarette and alcohol fund. We lived like that for eight years. My mom worked the graveyard shift and whenever I got home from school, she would be passed out on the couch until she had to get ready for work. Her ex-husband would take advantage of her absence at night to abuse me, and on the nights that he didn't, I would lie awake in fear of what would happen if he came up into my room. My mom was oblivious to this, she couldn't have known and I was too scared as a child to say anything about it. Eventually, their marriage fell off and they fought constantly. I cried every night as I tried to ignore their screaming matches. My mom took up drinking as a coping mechanism and the life we lived then, paired with her difficult upbringing in the Philippines only intensified her depression.

Long story short, my mom started online dating, and met my my now step-dad who took us under his wing. Yes, this was while she was still married, but God knows that man had side chicks. I could not have asked for a better father figure in my life and my step-dad has done more for me and my mom in the past five years than her ex-husband did in the eight years we lived with him.

While we are in a much better environment, both me and my mom have struggled with our mental health. In the eight years we lived with my mom's ex, I developed crippling anxiety and depression at a very young age with no one to support me. My mom admitted to having suicidal thoughts daily after some point in living with her ex. We finally got the treatment we both desperately needed with the help of my step-dad, and for a while, everything was great. Then, it wasn't.

Now, I should say the event that I'm about to detail has sporadically happened multiple times over the course of five years. Maybe it is the fault of my step-dad and I for not doing enough when this happened before, but what's done is done. Whenever my mom truly gets angry or frustrated, she really became a different person, She wouldn't listen to any sort of reason and would be convinced she had control of her actions. Maybe she does, I wouldn't know. To me, however, she does not. Whenever she gets in that way, I can't describe the look in her eye as anything other than psychotic. It makes me sick in the gut and my anxiety goes through the roof whenever I see her like that. She gets into these episodes where she storms out of the house and down the road and my step-dad and I are forced to get in the car and coax her into coming back with us in fear of her getting hurt on the road while she's not in the right state of mind. There was an incident like this where instead of storming off, she grabbed a knife and threatened to take her own life in front of me and my dad. It was a hard day, and she spent a week in the psych ward at the hospital. That specific incident was about two years ago now and immediately following that event, things got a lot better.

Of course, in the past couple of months I've noticed outbursts of hers (ones where she just gets unnaturally angry, but doesn't storm off anywhere) becoming more frequent and it's been taking a toll on me and my dad. Today was one of those days where she fought with my step-dad over something miniscule and she stormed off again. I won't get into the nitty gritty of it, but after I talked to her this evening about how she can confide in me and my step-dad and how she needs to be talking to her therapist about any negative emotions she's having, I talked to my dad. I advised him to accompany her on her next visit to her therapist and let her therapist know what's going on so we can help her get what she needs to get better. (The major incident from before was the effect of her taking medications that weren't working for her.) My step-dad tells me that my mom had told him one day, with a smile on her face on a day where they weren't having any issues that she hates being alone as whenever she is, she thinks about killing herself. He didn't want to tell me this happened because he hoped things would get better, but here I am now: writing this post after hearing she said that.

This, as her daughter is deeply concerning, and I can only imagine what my step-dad is going through as his late wife took her life several years before he met my mom. I really don't know what to do. I'm scared to death about what my mom might be capable of. When she gets into one of those psychotic episodes, it's like her strength is multiplied. It took everything in me to keep her back from grabbing those knives from the major incident before. All reason flies above her head. She has the capacity to seriously hurt herself in that state and even hurt me and my step- dad if we tried to interfere. We've hidden all the knives somewhere in the house, (only my step-dad knows where they are) but there's plenty other of ways to hurt yourself and potentially hurt other people in the house. I really don't know what to do here, I'm almost reluctant to go to bed tonight.
 
I need advice, tips, maybe stories of what you guys did in situations similar as mine. I don't know what's going to happen if we don't do anything about this. I'm not very good at this whole Reddit thing, so I'll do my best to update this post if anything happens. I just really need some help here.",26Sep2019,12

10,"I don't know if this is even the right place to post this, but here it goes. 

Recently things haven't been all so well. I used to have mild personality changes when I was about 11 or 12, then a few years later it got progressively worse. New problems appeared, symptoms, if that's what you'd call them. I noticed it changed/worsened with every bad event that's happened (i.e grandma's death, finding out I have severe scoliosis, being kicked out of school).


Now I am the most paranoid I have ever been. I never feel alone even when there's nobody in the room with me. I always feel like I'm being watched and followed by an entity/entitys of some sort, and my vision always somehow distorts to make it seem like I see some being out the corner of my eye. 
I also hear stuff a lot, auditory hallucinations I guess. 
Also, i feel like there's somehow 2 souls stuck in my one body. Two incredibly distinct personalities, if you will. 

I cannot open up to my parents about this because they will say it's all in my head. 

I need some opinions on what I should do. Please.

15,"Holy fuck, where do I start. My wife is an amazingly patient person. She works with children that have mental health problems. She understands all that knows how to relate with them. Now as our relationship has continued Some glaring things are starting to come to her attention. 

When she first met me my friends had started a company and I had just joined on as VP of sales.  It wasn’t until I met her that the company started doing well. I was doing everything I ever wanted to do. (I’m not very educated but I have work ethic and I can talk to people) as that started going downhill (the company) she started to see more and more that I wasn’t in reality, she said I lived life with roses for glasses and that I wouldn’t see things for how they are. Now that frustrated me but nothing could really bring me down I was fucking happy as shit. No boss living it up. 

But as that continued it really fell apart to where I had no money for Christmas and shit. I started beating my self up. Now this is where shit kinda comes full circle for me. I got a job with my uncle selling food to restaurants. I hate it there, I can’t stand the way he talks to people. Now as she’s questioning me and saying my moods are all over the place I can’t focus when I become mad. I lose sight of what we are fighting about. Any time I had alcohol or other things I can not take it, like I just become a mood swinging emotional mess. She says when I get worked up it’s like we are speaking two languages because you can’t talk to me cause I don’t understand things and I always fight everything. 

A little past, I’ve been in sports my whole life but never a calm person, always class clown. Always lived hard, I don’t know how to say this but like never stopping. When it was anything work, drinks, sports. But from the ages of 20-23 I’ve been in some shitty relationships. I’ve been really on my own sense 18. I feel like I haven’t had the opportunity to learn how to regulate my emotions and being feared or being loved was the only way to go forward. Even know I’m a little fucked up writing this because I have a lot of embarrassment for the fact I can’t afford $289 a month for a theripst and I don’t really want my wife or anyone really knowing that I think I have a personality disorder. 

To sum it up when I’m angry I’m angry for hours days. When I’m sad I can’t snap out of it. I want to know if you think that’s what it is or am I just being a person who should control his emotions better and move on? I don’t know.",26Sep2019,1

18,"I am in love with a girl like a mad. For some reason she is going to move on in next 4-5 months. She loved me, at least she said so. I still can't stop meeting her knowing it really well that future hold nothing for me in this regard. The problem is when we are alone in some park or travelling late on Uber I loose all of my control and I touch her private parts. She does try to show some resistance at times but ultimately she allows me. Now I am feeling guilty, I know she is not going to be my wife. But I can't help other than being physical with her. We didn't have sex before either. Is it normal to be physical with her like this? Am I a pervert? I have no such issues with any other girl, it doesn't matter how beautiful or sexy they are. But I loose all my controls when this girl is around. 

Should I go to psychiatrist for help regarding this?",26Sep2019,1
19,"first things first, I am not going to report him. He is a good guy, just made a stupid decision. 

I really just want to get this off my chest. I’m freaking out. This is probably going to be very scattered but I hope will make some sense. It’s terribly long so I’m sure no one will read and that’s fine. I didn’t proofread so I apologize. 

I’ve (mid 20s F) been seeing a therapist (late 50s M) for the past 4 months. 1-2x a week. More recently 2x a week for minimum of 2 hrs each session. He purposely puts my appt last in the day (5pm) because we always go over the typical session length. 

I was going to him because I was being sexually harassed and he had helped me find the nerve to speak up and get HR involved. I had felt so defeated and ruined by the harassment I was ready to kill myself. I took that moment to reach out and get help. 

I have trouble trusting people due to past trauma in my childhood but I felt safe with him so I opened up rather quickly. I spilled my entire life story to him. Every little TMI detail about my current relationship as well, he had been pushing/suggesting that I break things off because my partner won’t commit. 

As of 6 weeks or so ago, he started to sit on the couch with me instead of across from me in his chair. Then it moved to him putting his arm around me and “cuddling.” It was never more than that and I wasn’t uncomfortable until last week. Our sessions went from being us working through my crises to just talking because there wasn’t much else going on. He blurted out that he loved me two weeks ago. I didn’t think anything of it, I just assumed it was a small comment but I brought it up last week and said it was the first time anyone has said they loved me in many many years and it made my day to hear that. He began to ask me how I felt about him and hugged me tighter. 

Yesterday. Yesterday, he professed his love to me. He told me the reason I’m pulling away from my partner is his fault. He’s been selfishly trying to get me to break things off because he loved me. He told me how he went from thinking about me occasionally, to thinking about me at all points of his day. “I wonder what you do on the weekends, what you do when we’re not together, I’m always thinking about you.” He told me he loved me more than anyone he has ever met and that we had such a strong connection. That he almost kissed me the week prior because I had brought up his love comment. That he’s a normal, healthy man who finds me attractive. He knows I share similar feelings towards him. 

I stared off to the wall the entire time. He just kept talking about how he loves me and doesn’t ever want to lose me. That he wishes I could spend time with him outside of that setting. When he’s wondering what I’m doing, he’s wishing I was with him. He had to cancel one of our sessions recently, he said he was going to call me and ask me out to dinner that night because he just missed me so much. He said he had such a horrible night the other day he almost called me after midnight because he just wanted someone to hold. 

He hugged me tighter. He pulled back and then he went in to kiss me. (I should mention right now I do not have any physical attraction to him.) I don’t know why but when he kissed me, I pecked him back—he went in for a deeper kiss but when I actually realized what was happening I pulled away and stayed silent. He said he had been wanting that and hoping he wasn’t making an ass out of himself. He begged me to tell him how I felt towards him. I stayed silent. I was staring at the clock waiting for it to be after 6 so he would have to let me leave because he had another appointment. They were late. He asked me if I was uncomfortable and I said yes. He asked me what made me uncomfortable and I couldn’t get the words out. I moved away and stood up. I said I needed to process what happened and we could discuss it next time. He said I’m holding you to that and I left. 


I drove away and my anxiety was through the roof. I was so distracted and upset and just all over the place I ran a few red lights unintentionally. I called my partner and went to his house. I told him what happened. I can’t tell anyone else. Everyone I know, knows or knows of my therapist. I don’t want to get him in trouble. I just want to get this off my mind. I can’t get the picture of him going in for the kiss out of my mind and I had nightmares of it all last night. 

He came up to me today (we work in the same office complex). He apologized profusely. He said that that should have never happened and he is an idiot and shouldn’t have said that or done that. He didn’t want me to tell him how I felt because he knew and he realized it after I left. He said he was sick over it. I told him I wasn’t going to be going back but he asked to speak to me next week just to apologize and let me talk if I need to. I will never go back to therapy. I could only afford to go because it was provided to me. I feel sick over it. 

After everything. I felt like he was a father figure to me. When he said he loved me a few weeks ago, I took it as that kind of love—not an I’m in love with you kind of love.. he helped me cut out my toxic family members, but now I have nobody. I feel sad, and alone. More than alone, a terrible sense of loneliness.",26Sep2019,3

22," I've realized a while ago that no one actually cares about how you feel and that you shouldn't even bother talking about your feelings because they will just look at you weird and then try avoiding you. 
My mother was dying and I was very upset. 

So I figured I could confide in a coworker. He asked how I was doing I didn't just randomly walk up to him and randomly tell him. He knew the situation. After that whenever the coworker saw me they walked in the opposite direction. And maybe I shouldn't have confided in them, but it was also the same with friends. Not that they walked in a different direction or anything but it did seem that I was being avoided.
I realized you are just supposed to put a big fake smile on your face and act like everything is okay. I don't know how much longer I can keep this fake smile and act like everything is fine when it isn't.
 Please don't suggest going to a professional. If the people closest to me don't care, I highly doubt a complete stranger will.",26Sep2019,1
23,"I have had a very rough year and just need to vent. I moved from my home town 1 year and 4 months ago. I had a supportive family, I had more friends than I could count on my hands and feet- close friends, I completed two degrees and I felt on top of the world. 

I moved 10 hours from home alone. I was optimistic about making friends and new relationships - and what I have discovered is I have led a sheltered life. 

I became extremely lonely and but then I met “T”. At first I was skeptical of him because I just didn’t understand some of the stuff he was saying. It didn’t add up. He was a young educated able bodied male- he told me he graduated with honors from a good college. 

I later found out he work as chili’s (he is 31) as a server and he was on probation at that job. He told me he was trying to start a business and I wanted to be supportive and not care. 

Well finally one day he opened up to me with tear filled eyes about his painful past and his childhood abuse followed by the fact he went to prison and used to be addicted to drugs (claiming his mom fed him opiates from the age of a young teen). I felt so conflicted- should I leave? I should of- but I was lonely and weak and I really enjoyed spending time on him. I figured he was trying so I would again look past it. 

Well fast forward he lied about all his charges, he had much more than he originally told me about. His drug addiction wasn’t in the past as he relapsed on meth and he smoked weed behind my back several times. He was on probation so I really wasn’t cool with him doing anything illegal. Eventually I became a shell. I was miserable but I had nobody but him- and his very kind family. He was the only person I had so every lie he told I pretended to believe. One day I had enough when he asked to look at my phone and I asked to look at his in return. He refused- a fight ensued, he left the room and came back telling me I could look- reallyy? 

He told me I must not love him if I would leave him over that. I felt panicked and stayed- the thought of being alone was so scary. 

A few months later he left me for a girl he was cheating on me with and took stuff from my home, nothing big- just bath towels and small stuff, I was so sad. I went to therapy but I still missed him. But I wanted to not be mad and be happy for him. After 3 months of not reaching out .....I reached out telling him I was happy he found someone good for him. He told me he missed me and thought he might of made a mistake, but I said to put everything into his new relationship and if it should end for other reasons and we still had feelings we could explore our options. He contacted me two weeks later saying he broke up with her. We hung out a few times he asked if he could stay with me because he was in a bad place and didn’t want to be alone and he missed me.

I missed him so I let him move back in. 3 weeks later he left his computer open, I looked at his messages- the girl dumped him. He had been begging for her back the entire month. He told me he quit his job- he relapsed, lost his job, and the girl he cheated with left him because of it. 

I was angry, asked him to gather his stuff and leave. A huge fight ensued. Really nasty things were said on both sides. That day he said he was taking my protein powder and I could try to stop him but he is like 8 inches taller than me and 60 pounds more and very muscular so I just took that L and let him have it. Well today I realized he took my AirPods. My $180 AirPods. WTH 

Being alone away from friends and family is hard, I’ve never felt so low. I know it’s partially my fault for going back and contacting him- I want my mental health to be good again so bad. And I want to be confident, and to trust people- but I just feel so low right now, sighhh",26Sep2019,1

25,"I was volunteering with a kid with autism like a month ago, and I might have given him a piggy bak ride or something. My hand came really close to his di\*\*. So immediately my mind was telling me that I was a bad person, I was a molester, etc, even though I knew deep down I didnt even do anything. From that point on I was really nervous volunteering with him, and maintained my distance from him. He always sits down in a corner and reads his book, and his mom always tells me just to read next to him, or play with a soccer ball or something when he reads it. I decided to test the thoughts in my mind, so I threw a ball on his lap like a dozen times, to test if he had any reaction when it his his crotch. Of course I never came into contact with his crotch. He had no reaction, and was very comforatble, so I felt relieved and verified that I never did anything wrong. Then a few weeks later he knocks the door for his mom to come(mom keeps door locked for whatever reason), because he needs to use the restroom. I also pound on the door, and she doesnt even answer. He then scratches his privates for whatever reason, and pees his pants. It didnt strike me at all then, and the session went on normally. A couple days later, it comes into my mind that what if I Was the one who put my hands in his pants, which would have been physically impossible. And the next week I tried to verify it again. He needed to use the bathroom again, and it takes a while for his mom to open the door. Lo and behold, he did the same thing again. He scratches his privates, but this time he didnt pee his pants because his mom came in time. The moment he did that, I verified it was not my hands, but his, as i literally saw him doing that. I even got my phone out and texted myself that it was HIM who did it and not me. That reduced my stress a lot, but I still have OCD and intrusive thoughts to this day about the thought that I could have touches his privates, and it seems so lucid and real(imagine myself grabbing a dick or some bullshit). I have no idea why, but I will say I had severe OCD in the past. Thanks for listening.",26Sep2019,1
26,"My husband was emotionally and a little physically abused as a child. She still also talks very negatively to her kids. Because of this, he was diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD.

When she says jump, he says how high, which unfortunately puts a strain on our relationship sometimes (but that's for another subreddit/time). Tonight we were talking with his sister who brought up some of the physical abuse (she got the worst of it) and when we left, he actually said something along the lines of ""she did the best she could, raising three kids on her own"".

28,"Hey reddit... I'm not sure how to do this but here we go.

I guess I should start by telling you a little about myself. I am a 22 year old female and I weigh 50kgs (if it's needed) and I am 5,5 in height.

I have been studying from home ever since I left college. I tried finding a job but it never worked out for me so I decided to complete my studies from home and continued looking for a job in between... I never got any of the jobs I applied for and it still upsets me cause I really do want a job. I was happy to stay home in my room for a long time and it was enough for me for a long time, but now, all I wanna do is feel normal. But this isn't all about the job, I just believe it's a part of it.
I was put on Ritalin at the age of 11 or 12 and was taking it for a few years, and because of this I had gotten into the habit of not Eating enough. (I have always been skinny and have a fast metabolism) I know that because I have a fast metabolism means I should eat more and healthy at that but I don't know why I just don't...
I tend to skip eating all together during the day and will just eat dinner... (I just don't feel hungry) but when I'm super depressed I over eat on junk food and I know I shouldn't but even though I'm not hungry... Food still seems to bring me joy...
Staying at home in my room has always been enough for me but lately I've been self reflecting and I can't even recognize myself anymore.... I'm a shell of who I used to be and have no idea how to go back to being ""normal"". I've been really depressed lately because I can't even get my first job and am scared ill be stuck 8n this room forever... I'm loosing hope fast and don't know where to go from here and I seem to only be getting worse... I've been staying home since I was 19 and I'm 22 now... How do I even change when the world won't even give me a chance... I've tried to get a job countless times and it's just never worked out... I'm so lost and don't even know if this post is understandable enough to how serious this really is... I'm getting to the point where if the world doesnt want me around... Then why am I here😔 guess this whole post had no meaning other than I'm a complete mess and loosing it fast...",26Sep2019,2
29,"I’ve (19 F) been struggling with mental illness since I was in middle school, however, I’ve been good at hiding it from others for so long. I’m currently a sophomore in college and ever since my freshmen year, I feel like acquaintances and friends have found out about it b/c I haven’t been able to mask my symptoms as I used to. Ever since I started college, mental breakdowns have been occurring regularly and even though I have friends who try to help, I feel bad b/c I feel like I’m dragging them with me. After each breakdown I feel guilty and feel like I should apologize to everyone because of my behavior. It seems like it’s affecting my relationship with my boyfriend and friends as well. How can I fix this?",26Sep2019,1
30,"I say I don't know where to begin because I really don't know when this all started for me. I have always been successful in everything that I do, I graduated college, I can learn and adapt quickly to a lot of different environments and jobs and can fix almost anything. But I also get bored easily, this has led me to have lots and lots of different jobs. I have worked in restaurants, been an explosives technician, an EMT, a field science intern for a climate research firm, a mechanic, a ski instructor, the list goes on and on. Most recently I have been a farmer, which has been fun and I would say that I am extremely grateful for what I have and for the people in my life but I have recently been feeling lost.

I am just going to set the scene for where I am at mentally, you can skip this if you want. Ten days ago I was in a pretty bad car accident. It was a Saturday, I had just finished cutting about 20, 100' trees up into logs to be chopped and stacked for the winter (I live in a little cabin out in the middle of the mountains), and since it was a Saturday I was going to go out and have some beers as I normally do. All of the time. I don't live that far from town so I go pretty frequently. I have been seeing this woman who has been a lot of fun but made it clear when we started seeing each other that we are just friends with benefits, I have a hard time with that but I enjoy her company so I have been putting aside my desire for something more and rolling with it. Anyway, I had a long day and she was being really kind of mean so I got to where I drink and started slamming beers. The good high ABV IPA, which I can normally knock a few down and be fine. But I was on a mission to feel better because you know alcohol solves all our problems... She joins me at some point in the evening and we end up going to another place to drink more, she is also on a mission to get hammered so there we are. The next thing I know, I wake up in the hospital. I wrecked my truck into a boulder field that is on the way to my house, my head went through the windshield and I broke a couple ribs. Mind you, the only thing I have on my record is a couple speeding tickets. Not to say that I don't make questionable choices, I just don't usually do something so stupid to get caught. So, here I am all injured ( I am actually really lucky I have as few injuries as I do, I have some kind of guardian) and reflecting on how I got to this point in my life. I write every day, about everything really but I try to focus on the possible reasons of how I got here.

Here is the point of this post. I have always drank on a daily basis but don't have an issue with stopping when I need to. Yes, it is hard for to stop drinking when I start for the night, but I know that. I have been trying to identify my trigger to Start drinking and I think I have identified it, or part of it at least. I hate being alone, physically but mostly emotionally. The only time that I have even thought about drinking is after someone has come to visit me to check on me and hang out for a little while. When they leave I get this really deep sinking feeling in my chest and almost what I can only describe as dread. Then my next thought as they walk out the door is, I want to go out. I want to see people, I want a beer, I want to make some connections with new people or hang out with friends. But it is really powerful. It seems so irrational to feel that way to me because I live out in the mountains, purposefully away from people. I like my alone time usually, but these past few months I have been on a path of drinking and socializing beyond a normal level for me. I just don't know what to think about it or where to even start to address this behavior. I usually have myself on lock, I am usually aware of who I am and every choice I make has a purpose. But I took a wrong turn somewhere and now I am lost. And it took an unfortunate accident for me to realize this. It has been a crazy year, to say the least.

I don't really know what I am looking for by posting this here, but if someone reads this and has the slightest bit of wisdom or something, I will be grateful.",26Sep2019,1
31,"My whole life I always thought depression was not a real thing it was just something we said when we felt sad or down or  just something temporary.  The story really starts with a girl named Karen she is my cousin's ex wife they married sometime around 2000 maybe 2001 or so, at the time I believe I was 14 years old had a huge crush on her very very pretty girl very very down to earth and friendly the most unique smile I ever saw in my life. I got immediately consumed by her kindness and how anybody can be this perfect, because of this I started visiting her on weekends by her husband who again was my cousin. She was always so happy and excited to see me when I came she treated me so nicely almost like her own son. First time in my life I had ever known such love and compassion as I grew up without parents as they were in the US during my childhood. 

After visiting her every single Saturday I noticed a change in her mood she wouldn't always be happy but whenever she saw me she was glad to see me and I would do whatever minor things I could to assist her with her new born baby, after a while her husband decided I was coming there too often so he told me to stop coming and insulted me. Karen told me quietly don't worry about him and to keep coming and because I was so attached to her I kept coming, one day she told me how her father in law would curse her and how her husband would curse her and abuse her how badly he treated her. He was a chronic gambler, drinker and abusive person, Karen luckily was educated and had a good job and her own car. This guy I speak about is a very evil person when we had little family gatherings you would see how he treated his wife and was just appalling you could see the arrogance in that sick fuck god alone knows what he did to her behind closed doors. 

I felt absolutely crushed by this because immediately I saw her father in law walking down the step and he overheard our conversation and to me it felt like she was living in hell I could just get the vibes immediately, living by her husband family in that same house was a very bad move because she was a lone wounded warrior against an army of evil people everybody treated her badly and one of the reasons they treated her badly was because Karen was a Christian and her husband despised her for her religion her sister in laws and everybody hated her because of this, she tried buying them gifts in the hope they would accept her but they would throw away the gifts she bought a pair of sneakers for her father in law as a gift and he threw it at her. These things scarred my mind because I have too much empathy in me and I was so attached to Karen I was practically in love with her. 

After things started going really badly Karen had enough so one day when the husband wasn't home she took all her stuff with the 2 kids and left his sorry ass for good she never looked back she divorced him. Her son which is a very smart person came by us recently with his grand father yes Karen's ex father in law and he was bragging about how great his grandson did because according to this guy it is all about ""Our Surname"" title is why he did so good. This immediately triggered my memory of Karen because I know how he is talking is he is trying to condition the boy to believe that his mother means nothing. An old wound opened up in my brain

I tried to get into contact with Karen with countless failed attempts until I gave up and realized it was impossible. Then one day I got a message on my phone the person said ""Hey I heard you wanted to speak to me?"" I said Karen? she replied yes. I called her immediately and explained that I wanted to find out how she was doing and that I heard how good her son did in exams she told me thanks but she really doesn't want to speak to me or anybody right now, after the first initial shock I understood being a grown man I couldn't take it to heart after what my family did to her. I told her no problem that is not a problem I understand she then thanked me for asking how she was doing and she said by the grace of god she is doing wonderful, but even then you could hear the sadness in her voice she can't hide it from me I am extremely emotionally connected to her even after 15 years of not talking to her she still completely consumes me and every part of her pain conducts through me like electricity through copper. Infact for 15 years everytime I would see a 2000 model Toyota Corolla I would remember her every single time because that is the car she drives. I will admit it I have always been completely in love with her. 

After that I messaged her on wats app and attempted to make contact again letting her know I disowned my family for what they did to her and I let them know how they ruined her life. 

This then triggered a serious case of depression in me it quickly and rapidly started tearing my mind apart I started getting an anxiety attack which is really bad for those who never experienced it, makes you think you are dying and your blood pressure skyrockets to dangerous levels.  

This added to my already depressed state of mind of not having accomplished anything meaningful at 33 years old and it ignited another guilt I tried to bury long ago when I could have used my high school education at 18 years old to join the police service or some service get a decent job then save Karen by marrying her that was my plan anyways no idea if she would have been interested in me but I wanted it so badly just to try. My failure to do this is the single deepest regret of my life that I have buried in my mind and suppressed it for over a decade. And now that she is 47 or 48 years old the regrets haunt me deeply as all this time could have potentially been spent with her during our younger years. I say potentially because I have no idea if life would have played out like this or if she would have ever been interested in me romantically. I was prepared to let her live how she wanted to party as much as she wanted anything that would make her happy. I was fit and I assume somewhat handsome I guess so the idea didn't seem like a pipe dream. 

Her wats app then went blank for a week then one day in work she contacted me and she ended up bringing up the past how her ex treated her, I realized how extremely hurt and broken she still is after so long, she let me know how lucky she was to have a friend like me, but I cannot and will not tell you what she told me after out of respect for her privacy even tho this is an anonymous post, I respect her too much to break a promise I kept which I said I would keep things between us. She said she wants to meet with me I said yes please let us meet then her wats app goes blank and I never heard a word from her again her phone is switched off and she probably won't ever contact me again and I must live with that. I tried to find out as much as I could from others found out she was even missing at one point and no one said anything except one sweet honest cousin of mine which I will get to later. I realized Karen was broken into a million pieces and as I tried to piece her life together it kept breaking me every single time. I have had girl friends leave me in the past and never ever have I experienced anything remotely close to this for someone I have not spoken to in 15 years

My depression just outright skyrocketed to the point where I started losing my memory temporarily, immediately realized that it is real and scary as fuck. To know what she is going through is extremely painful and just think this isn't even my life it is her life that is ruined so you could imagine how hard it has been on her after the sick bastard wrecked her life. The psychopath saw a pretty, good looking, humble and quiet girl with a soft and kind heart to advantage and that is what he did. Ripped her heart right out and tore it to pieces and it didn't phase him one bit he has and always will be an absolute monster. He was a control freak who would insult her even when she tried to watch a movie she liked but he wasn't interested in. 

After he made a post recently about Tropical Storm Karen but rather directed it towards his ex wife in a snark way I couldn't stand by having him rub salt in her wound I went to facebook and I dealt with him properly then I screen shot it and send it to everybody now everybody knows what he did to her and the true person he really is. He had his sister call me to threaten me to take down the post I refused and I blocked her let her know she and her nasty minded family fucked up Karen's life and there is no forgiveness for that. They then called my father, he attempted to curse me and threaten me and black mail me to take down the post and instead apologize to the ex wife abuser and if I didn't he would not be giving me money to pay out for my HVAC Technician course. 

I said good you and that money will remain right there I am done, I blocked him and my sister because I didn't want him using her phone to call me. and I never plan to ever unblock them, That is fine tho I can save up the money and finish my schooling cause I have a job as crappy as the job may be. Because to me it was a matter of principle and character for standing up for someone who absolutely deserves it, no amount of riches in this world can ever buy me

Depression got to near deadly levels but somehow I felt better at the same time for having done such a good deed. Then my amazing awesome cousin I don't want to say her name incase she ever reads this so I will just nick name her ""Bess Thing Cousin"" a name that my friend at work gave her cause he likes pretty girls. She always checks on me via wats app to see how I am doing she is an absolute angel just a pure heart of gold who always looks out for others she has a lot of empathy like I do she knows the entire story and is always there for me. 

Somehow and I cannot explain it but her kindness towards me, looking out for me and being an awesome support cousin and friend made me feel a billion times better. It instantly cut my depression in half which I am going to take gladly at this point. I am extremely lucky to have a cousin like her in my life because of how pure she is she isn't fake or pretending just a pure person and when you know this and you can talk to someone like this it makes the world of difference. And this is why I think that I can help alleviate Karen's depression also, I just got a whole lot stronger and braver thanks to this sweet dear cousin of mine. My depression is rapidly vanishing because of this girl. To know I have a cousin so awesome she and Karen are the best friends I ever had in my life.",26Sep2019,1
32,"I guess I need to put a trigger warning on this? I’m sorry, I’m typically a lurker and don’t ever post.

Not really sure why I’m posting this. I guess I just wanted to see what other’s thoughts were on a situation like this. And to vent about it. 

I asked a couple coworkers to help me practice interview questions for a position opening up in the company. I am almost hopeless in an interview so I need all the help I can get and my answers, even though I just mostly stalled and got embarrassed when trying to think of things on the spot, were all weak and rough around the edges. 

C (the one this is about) asks me “how do you deal with different personalities?” And I answer truthfully, somewhat along the lines of “I do what I can to mesh well with other people because I want them to like me and at the very least I want to be respected...” C looks over to my other coworker, makes a face and they start to laugh. I’m guessing because my answer sounds stupid or cheesy.

This is when she says “Hide the razor blades” and makes a wrist cutting motion. They both were laughing. 

I’m someone who hides my depression, I am pretty open about any worries or anxieties I have. C sees me as “sensitive” or whatever. So I ask “why are you doing that I’m not going to kill myself?” And then her tone switches and goes into what a good answer would be like for that question and maybe even says “I’m just kidding” before getting serious again. I can’t remember exactly what was said after that. 

My husband thinks I should report her to HR immediately. C is a very hateful person and I have witnessed her say some terrible things about other people in the company and then act friendly towards them. I can’t help but think about things she says behind my back. I’ve never given her a reason to treat me like this and this sort of thing really gets to me. 

She eventually went on to joke about how you just have to get along with the right people (meaning them) and C went as far as to say “you don’t want to be on my bad side.”

I’m not the type of person to confront people or try to get them fired. I honestly don’t understand why she said that in front of me. If it happens again I will definitely say something but C is right about not getting on her bad side because I’ve seen what she gets away with. 

I didn’t realize it until later on in the day but what she said coupled with the fact that when they went out to lunch they probably made fun of me, just fucking got to me and I cried at work and REALLY cried when I got home.

I know it’s stupid of me to think this way and I don’t actually want to die but I had thoughts of killing myself just to make her feel fucking horrible. I wouldn’t do it, I just want her to feel like shit.

It’s true I am depressed from time to time. I never thought any of that showed at work and I don’t self harm. So I’m wondering if this was just some dark humor coincidence or if she can see through me and tell that I really do get sad and is just that shitty of a person.

33,"So, for starters, I am homicidal. Beyond belief. Well over 50% danger, perhaps. 

Wanting to kill people is nothing knew. I've watched people get shot, stabbed, commit sucide, beheadings, severed body parts, the list goes on.

35,"I only went for a few months, so not very long. I would always just leave frustrated, which is interesting, because I would talk about my frustration the entire time. 

Everything he had to say, I already knew, already did, everything. There was no new perspective he could offer me. Everything he suggested, I was already doing. 

He kept rambling about things I already knew, because I did so much research on my own when I had no insurance. 

It was just outright unhelpful. Nothing changed. I don’t think it was any fault of his. I just dont think there’s any helping me anymore. I’ve come so far and accomplished so much, but it feels like this is as far as I can get. 

Which really sucks. Because everything still hurts. The only thing that can help me is changing my environment, which I literally am incapable of. 

I can’t choose my family. I can’t choose who loves me. I can’t choose to have a stable life when I’m dirt poor and have no way to change it any time soon.

36,"What mental health issue do I have?

I was thinking quiet borderline, without the clingyness of people.... I moreso avoid people - truly because I can't deal with the fake social norms of fitting in, or getting someone to like me. The smiling, it's socially exhausting. Though I feel so lonely. I feel like I'm socially on the outskirts. When someone emotionally hurts me (bossy, controlling, making me feel like I'm younger or don't know anything, those that throw friendship away) --- I cut them out and/or start hating them. I'm tired of being disrespected by people. Sometimes I literally feel like peter Parker - shy smiley, when I wave goodbye, I'm ignored by people. 
I feel so fake. I have a lot of internal shame, self hatred. I'm extremely critical of myself. I never really self harmed. Though I don't eat at times. I have mood swings that go from feeling meh, to suicidal. Or anger. With people... or with myself. I never really let people know what's going on. 
I could fucking throw things, break things, scream to express this anger. 
I haven't been to a councellor.
I have planned out my suicide, either by hanging, ordering the chemical compound that ""right to die"" uses...
I have been lonely nearly half my life. The last time I had a birthday party was when I was 11.
I never hang out with people. I feel so socially behind... I figure I'll never marry, have children.
The remainder of my youth was spent with men who honestly were not right for me... and now I feel all used up and old.


People view me as under confident, shy, sweet, polite reserved woman. If anyone were to know what goes on under the surface... I just hide what I think and feel. I know it's completely stupid. Maybe from years of thinking I was never good enough.

My family history as a lot of anxiety and depression. Two aunts had achozoaffective disorder. That's all I know.

Some days, I'm completely okay.... other days, I just don't want to face my life. I've had beginnings of these mood swings since early twenties. Struggled deeply with social anxiety in my teens... now these feelings have gotten worse. To the point where life feels unreal. I feel so alone.

37,"Hey all,

Sorry if this is kind of vague, but I've googled all over and can't seem to find anything relevant. Maybe I'm just wording it poorly.

As a child I used to occasionally get this sudden feeling that I was about to be hit in the head by a high-velocity object. Usually a stone, coin or other small hard object. It would be absolutely paralyzing to experience.

The only thing I can remotely compare the sensation to is having a fear of heights (which I also have). That sudden sinking, panicky, uncomfortable feeling that makes you scuttle back away from the high ledge you peeked over? Imagine this feeling, but it comes on SUDDENLY and also there's no ledge to back away from. You're just stuck feeling it. This sudden, insistent, jarring feeling that a fast-moving object is about to peg you in the head.

I used to try to describe the feeling to my parents, but I was quite young and they couldn't understand what I was trying to tell them. I just started calling it ""rock fear"". To be fair I was an annoyingly creative child always making up all manner of nonsense so I don't exactly blame them for being dismissive at the time.

The only specific triggers I can recall causing this sensation were simply thinking about tiny objects moving at high speeds. Sometimes I'd see a meteor falling or a bullet being fired in a TV show or cartoon and that could get me spiraling out of control thinking about it, causing the terrible sensation.

The only way I found to manage these attacks was to gently knock on my skull with my knuckles or similarly dense object repeatedly whenever it happened. I remember one time getting such an attack in a grocery store and using a canned good this way. I would not hurt myself doing this, it was just a very gentle tapping. A sort of way to simulate the feeling I was worried about which would end the crippling anticipation of it.

I experienced these attacks into my early teens and then at some point they just stopped happening and I kind of forgot about them - I'm well into my 30s now.

Has anyone else experienced this sort of sensation - or does anyone know what this could have possibly been?

Oh, and no, describing the feeling for you here did not make me start experiencing the attacks again (thank god).",26Sep2019,2

I don't even know why I am writing you all, I'm just at the edge of what's humanly possible to endure.

Let me tell you about myself. I am 27, college graduate, no job (was fired last Friday) all my job experience consists of 3 places all of them with an average of 7 months of employment so we can say no career either, I haven't cleaned the apartment I live in for over a year, I can't go back to my parents, no boyfriend, no friends, I have herpes.

I feel I've neglected my cat and ironically the only way my dad will take me again in his house is if I surrender my cat to a shelter, which is impossible, I would never leave her. She's the literal only being that has kept me alive.

40," 

For context Im a 22 year old trans girl, I returned to college this year after being so depressed/dysphoric last year that I dropped out and barely went out of my house, except for my therapy sessions and other important events. Since I returned to school this year and started transitioning my life has gotten so much better, I can actually focus on my studies too and my dysphoria has greatly decreased thanks to laser hair removal, coming out to everyone and being accepted and having an orchiectomy two months ago. I cant underestimate either the complete acceptance and embrace my mother has shown me and the positive effect it has had.

I havent started HRT (Estradiol) yet and I havent changed my legal name yet but all is going well and those two events have already been planned for the foreseeable future. I also still wear ""guy clothes"" but I dont see it as an important part of my transition and is the least of my concerns. I should also mention my therapist who has often been my rock in the hell that was last year, he helped me maintain hope and always showed deep empathy, Ive already been with him for 5 years and he told me he loved me last year (not romantically.) I love him too and the thng is that even though orchiectomy has obliterated my sex drive and I havent touched myself in over a month, I still go on Tinder just to get matches from random men. The thing is, even though I havent started HRT yet and am relatively early in my transition, I ""pass"" as a woman a lot of the time, probably more than 50% which is probably due to my very feminine voice, no muscle, beautiful hair, small hands and feet and light build.

This has also meant that I have become the target of male attention, whether it is men matching me on Tinder or creepy men catcalling me at night from a car when Im just wearing a sweatshirt. I had a weird platonic thing with a guy I met on Tinder but its over now and is really off topic, maybe Ill talk about it some other time. The thing is that lately ive been having sexual dreams and feelings about my therapist, which had subsided years ago but they were weaker too and now Im ruminating about whether he truly sees me as a woman or not. Apparently he does but it still crosses my mind. I also wonder if he would have sex with me if I wasnt his patient or if he would even date me.

I know that neither of those would happen now, its unethical and possibly illegal but I still wonder if he sees me as a woman in THAT WAY, or would in a hypothetical future, and if I would really want to know in case he didnt and I was as a result completely devastated. So I had two dreams about him lately, in one he ""confessed"" that he didnt really see me as a woman and I told him he was a liar and he had destroyed me by not letting me go before, in the other dream I was completely transitioned and he left his wife to be with me. I also stalked his wife and found some of their wedding pictures and that hurt me I dont know why, maybe a belief that I would never have stood a chance if I wasnt his patient or a fear that I will never find something similar, a theme we have talked about in previous sessions. It kind of feels like Im"" losing my mind"" right now, between stalking his wife and having these feelings I dont know what to do, for a moment I thought of quitting because I felt all this hurts me but I dont think I can walk away with all the progress we have done and can still achieve, right?

I’m feeling more and more numb as the days go on. But I’ve managed to hold on to a little bit of hope, despite all I’ve been going through. So I finally broke down and told a friend about it. It took a lot for me to do this, because I already feel like a burden to everyone and didn’t want to add to that. But I did it. And all they had to say was, “I’m sorry you feel that way.” After building up the courage to open up about my current mental state. After breaking down and sobbing and allowing myself to be vulnerable in hopes that I can find some relief. But I feel even more hopeless than I did before. I feel so stuck. I don’t know how to handle this. I’m sorry if this seems all over the place. I hope I’m making sense. I’m so out of it nothing even feels real anymore.",26Sep2019,1
42,"I am a bi polar mom of 3. I just recently (within 2 years) received my diagnosis, and subsequent meds, but this is not a surprise to me at all. 

I have struggled throughout my entire life with depression, mania, psychosis, suicidal thoughts. My first memory of my having suicidal thought was around the second grad, or age of 7. My family's history of mental illness was a well-kept secret, in that *no one* ever *dared* say anything about mental illness,  doctors or medications. Even regular primary care docs were verbally bashed and mistursted to the point I nearly died of infection, and my sister felt horrible for taking me to the emergency room because my mother would be *MAD AT HER* (Another story for another time) 

Anyhow, I grew up and made my own choices about my mental care and am now successfully receiving treatment for my diagnosis.  

I know the likelihood of one (or more) of my children having mental health issues/ illness and because I suffered for silence for so long, I feel like I owe it to myself and my kids to be proactive. 

I never, ever expected it to be my baby boy. My youngest son is nearing 4 and I can see his frustration with himself. He has misguided anger and a lack of confidence that is abnormal, I think, in a child so young. He constantly calls himself stupid if he is corrected by myself, dad or a sibling. We don't even use that word frequently. He gets upset about something and he tells up with anger. Not typical 4 year old anger, but I see the rage and screaming sadness, the same I sometimes *still* display, as my moods aren't quite stable yet (still adjusting meds). 

I know that I want to seek counseling for him, and myself probably. I guess *I* am just seeking reassurance that I'm not jumping the gun because my own mental health was so neglected by my own family.  I never want my children to feel hopeless.",26Sep2019,1
43,"So I’m currently outside my house typing this, unfortunately this has gone on for a while now a few years in fact, but to give some context....

Ever since 6th grade parents have always been on my tail about grades and I’ve never been good at school, but I know I have to potential to do well, the catch is.....I just don’t want to, so it just ends up in arguments every since time they check and whenever the first bad grade they see they just explode, it wasn’t until recently they’ve been more lenient, but the old ways are coming back again and I’m in my senior year of high school, just because I’m not doing well again

Also in middle school I had issues with mental health, to name a few anxiety, ADD, depression, suicidal thoughts, and my parents thought it was a load of bs unfortunately, so I basically fought through myself, with the side of a psychologist. Middle school grades were a disaster by the way, but made it through physically

So now I’m just here thinking, I want to leave and I don’t want anything to do with them anymore, but I’m going to college here, so chances are I’m probably going to stay at home and not have to pay for a dorm, so I’m probably stuck with them for another 4 years until I get my bachelors and a job

One final thing to add, I don’t want any support either, but I’m also having second thoughts of it, in the scenario I would need help, financially most likely, if I don’t want to ask my parents, who would I ask? So that’s just my internal conflict currently and it’s only the start of my senior year by the way......",26Sep2019,1

45,"I just graduated from a 3-month residential treatment program for CBT. If I sit around and think back long enough, some of the things I learned were marginally beneficial, but overall my situation remains mostly unchanged.
I have also been through psychotherapy, DBT, years of talk therapy, and a transitional living program for independence and accountability practice. Nothing seems to change or even slightly alleviate my terribly low self-esteem, anxiety, and low mood. I have a miserable case of imposter syndrome as well, which leads to me underrelating with my illness and feeds into the sense of hopelessness.
My official diagnosis is persistent depressive w/ major depressive episodes, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and dependent personality disorder. I'm really trying to hold on to the sliver of hope I have and not give up. If not for me, I'm at least trying to do this for the good of those who care about me. I just don't know what to even try or do at this point. Any suggestions on how to procceed would be greatly appreciated (I'm in the US if that matters).

46,"I’m feeling helpless because I live out of state and I can’t be physically around him and we’ve never had the relationship of talking about serious things. Everyday I stress about if he’s okay or not and it’s really taking a toll on me. 

He’s recently told our mom his life has been horrible for 7 years (he’s 21), says he’s not going to be around a long time, has panic attacks over nothing, and constantly makes excuses over not seeing a therapist. He was taking an anti depressant and is due to run out of anxiety medications.

Because he’s terrified of normal social interactions including ones with family, I don’t know how to approach this situation. I was thinking of writing a letter to him explaining he has to empower himself to get the help he needs while the people who care about him will be all the support he needs.It will be a good growing opportunity for me as well because I have trouble expressing emotions.",26Sep2019,1
47,"I listen to them for different things. To destress, gain more happiness and confidence and for motivation and creativity. Tonight I was listening to one that gets rid of fears and makes you believe you can and will succeed. It was almost 40 minutes long. I went so deep into hypnosis and lost all feeling in my physical body. When i came out of it i felt euphoric and energized. I usually feel really depressed, lazy and unmotivated. I do sometimes switch between highs and lows in my mood but I've never been diagnosed with anything. 

So anyway i came out if hypnosis in one of those high manic episodes. Or at least that's the closest thing i can compare it to. I was so happy leaping around my room twirling and getting work done that I've needed to do for my job. I felt and still feel really uplifted and like I'm seeing things differently with new positive emotions. I wonder if this will last. Either way hypnosis will continue to be a regular thing for me.

My boyfriend worries about me doing stuff like this because I'm not exactly mentally well. There are no warnings on these videos other than ""do not listen while driving or operating machinery."" I think that if anything i could benefit. I don't see it being a bad thing. I don't do drugs. My only addiction is caffeine.",26Sep2019,2

I am 27, the manager of Data Science for a fairly well known company in the defense industry. I enjoy my job, it’s what I wanted when I left for college at 18. However it is very boring and repetitive. I have a lot of interaction but it is the same conversations just different outputs. I spend about 50-60 hours a week in the office it’s pretty split 50/50 meetings and computer work. I love my job.
I make way more than I should  and I get along with everyone. 
I have never had one argument or awkward disagreement or situation with anyone in my 4 years there. 

I am very happy and love my life. I don’t remember the last time I was sad or upset about anything other than something like one of those sad abandoned puppy videos.

Anyway recently something has been happening that is freaking me out.

I can’t remember anything about work once I’m about halfway home. I can’t remember anyone’s faces or what my office looks like. When I think of my day it’s just like white I can’t explain it. Think like just a white computer screen.

 Once I get back in the office, look at my emails or check my work phone it all comes back to me.
For example right now I don’t remember what my building looks , what my office looks like or what I worked on today. I know the company I work for, I can picture the route there but once I get to where I turn for my building my mind goes blank. 
There are people I see everyday and I have worked with for  3+ years. I can’t remember anything about them, I can’t even think of names to give faces to, except for the ones I consider friends. The weird thing about that is when I think of my work friends the only memories I can remember are those of when we spend time outside of work.

I have tried to see if this happens with anything not associated with my current job and it does not. I have tried thinking of different memories at different times throughout the day and there is no issue recalling anything. I am a data scientist after all and I haves tried hard to reproduce this error in memory and I can’t.

I don’t understand why this is happening I can’t recall when it started exactly maybe a year or so ago. At first it was funny now it’s freaking me out, can someone please shed some light, 2 days of google yielded no results. Thank you.

TLDR: I can’t remember anything about what I did at work once I get home and it’s freaking me out.",26Sep2019,5

51,"I can’t figure out what is true anymore. I keep telling myself all of this shit and I’ve turned myself into an overthinking mess. Sometimes I’ll tell myself everyone hates me. Sometimes I’ll tell myself that people do love me, but I’ve been subconsciously been tricking them into thinking I’m a good person when I’m actually a fucking piece of shit. I’m convinced that I’m hurting my friends and family. I know I’m hurting my friends and family with my constant mental turmoil. I skipped school today for a mental health break. As soon as I got home, I slept and slept for what seemed like forever. I kept having realistic dreams. I kept thinking that my mom was calling me from down stairs, or that my stepdad came into my room and told me to do something, but I couldn’t remember what. Everything was spinning and I wasn’t sure what reality was. I wasn’t sure what actually occurred and what was just a dream. It’s like that now. I don’t know what is true. I want to kill myself so bad. I’m so confused right now, but I do know I’m hurting my friends and family. I deserve absolutely nothing. I must be so fucking hard to deal with. Today has been a fucking hell storm of confusion, and all I’ve gotten out of it is how much I’m hurting everyone around me. I know if I kill myself, they’ll be sad. But what they won’t know is how much I’m actually helping them. They haven’t realized it yet, but me being around is only hurting them. I keep sending weird long texts to them. I’ll say stuff about how much I hate myself. Of course they’ll always say “don’t say that! You’re not worthless!” But they’ll get tired of it. We all get tired of it. I’m driving them tired and they feel the need to make sure I feel like something with worth cause I’ve made them think I do. But I know the truth. I don’t. I’m worthless.

52,"I'm tired of trying anymore and have been mentally and physcially burnt out for many years now. I have a job where I am highly regarded that pays well, but I have no interest in it.  I have multiple serious health problems that continue to worsen. Each day is a physical and mental struggle.  My wife is a long-time problem drinker and I can't stand to be near her when she drinks; which is every day. It's not near the volume she use to drink, but it's enough. The smell of it turns my stomache and brings me back mentally to the times I'd come home from work in the middle of the day to find her drunk or passed out in the house with our child.  We haven't had a physical relationship in over 10 years. She stopped being interested in that (with me) a long time ago. I stopped trying to initiate sex with her and she never said a word about it. She never attemped to talk about it or make any kind of effort. I'm approacing 60 now and feel too old and broken to start over. I have been very depressed for so long now that I don't really know how to feel good. I fake just about everything in my life now, I don't want to get out of bed most days. My emotions can flip daily from almost manic excited to very depressed and I am really getting paranoid about everything. I have no control of how I feel and if I seek professional help I will lose my job and any financial arrangements I have set up for my family. This is getting exponentially worse every day and I need it all to stop without it being obvious and jeopardizing financial benefits for my family. I've been trying to figure how to do this for a while and finally came up with a very simple solution.  I'm on multiple meds so I just stopped taking the ones for my heart a couple of days ago. It will probably will take a few months to work. I can't leave a note because that would defeat the purpose of this and my family will heal easier thinking that this was just a heart attack. It won't be a surprise to anyone with all the heart procedures I've had.  So I'm not sure why, but I created a quick anonomous reddit account so I could post something just for me to read. I'm not sure if it makes any sense, but it helps me to keep it straight in my mind. I'm not trying to create any kind of discussion and will not respond to anyone even knowing that most would post with good intentions. This is not a ""cry for help"", it is really just for me.

53,"First time posting in this subreddit, I'm not even sure if this is the right one, so ill just copy paste this post wherever it seems to fit.

I'll just cut to the chase. I've had a really bad break up out of a toxic relationship 2 years ago. One that left quite some mental scars, i put up with it and dealt with the problem as far as i could. But this one thing hasn't stopped for 2 years now and it's driving me insane.

Every single month for the past two years I have the same dream (nightmare?) about her on every 25th (the day we got together). It's nothing too extraordinary but just us living the life we always pictured. Whenever i wake up, realization hits me and reminds me of what a horrible person she was and the things she did to me. 

I was diagnosed with manic depression disorder a few years ago and ever since the relationship happened it got a lot worse. Those dreams are responsible for about 80% of the mood switches(?) I have. 

At this point i dont really know who to talk with, which is why im posting here. I would appreciate it if someone could tell me about a similar experience?

54,"This might be a long one, so like most reddit posts, I'm warning you in advance. And yes, I made another account, because my other one is public, and I want anonymous advice and space to, at the very least, *vent.*

I'm currently 15, writing from a Mac that I bought myself to pursue my creative interests that is mostly being used to work, work, work. Now, I hear ""like is going to be work"" all too often, and I'm sick of it. Here's why.

My mom is a tad, well, crazy. I don't want to say it. She is. She cheated on my dad multiple times out of spite from years before in high school, she frequently screams at my toddler siblings as if they're 40 year old office workers, and has made my step father cry on numerous occasions. My last ""talk"" with her was her passively aggressively ranting about whatever new thing she has to. I'm not saying that's bad, we all have are issues, but she is a big stressor because she causes drama so often.

My stepfather (who I live with, with my mother and siblings) is a decent guy. Does his job, comes home, gets a shitstorm (oh, and I might casually swear, so sorry in advance?) throw at him when he gets home, etc etc. He's seeking therapy because he was diagnosed with PTSD and home life makes it no better, I tend not to bother him, let him better himself.

My father is pushing to have me move out with him. But mom can use my stepfathers and fathers money to pretty much bankrupt my father in court debt. He pays $200 for me alone, which I can't believe. I pay for my own things, I pull my own, I work on my own, and she's still getting half his paycheck. As much as I'd like to live with him, I refuse to put him through that and I need to watch over my siblings. They shouldn't have to deal with what I did, which leads me to my next point. 

My father disappeared one night about 7 or 8 years ago, and all I could hear was my mother screaming outside into a small, prepaid, Boost Mobile smartphone. I was scared, and I missed my father, and I was crying behind a small, child-size recliner in my bedroom. To which point she apparently got sick of it, ended the call, and hit me because I was crying too much and being a nuisance to her. Which, because she is back on a bipolar streak (and she refuses to get help, in anyway), I fear for my siblings, and nothing has occurred yet, and I'm not letting it. 

Due to his job, I'm not allowed to disclose more information, if a disturbance call is made to authorities, my step father is frozen out of his job for months at a time. Which is why, at the worst of it, no one can do anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I mentioned I bought a new computer. A used MacBook Pro for right around $300. I'm rather talented with mobile repairs and such, and make money off doing so. So I bought it, upgraded it, and was dabbling in Photoshop, Final Cut, GarageBand, and I always had a calling to video editing and film. I had all these ideas for projects and ideas, and put one or two in motion, until my latest stressor...

Summer ended. I had to go back to public school, where I am in AP classes from years prior, and have a schedule so jam-packed that I don't have a lunch. My French and Publishing teachers excuse me for lunch sometimes and since I bought the Mac, I can always catch up pretty quick and type up anything I miss. Nevertheless, I am still left with more work at the end of the day because sometimes, it just isn't enough time. 

Today, I had a stressful day, where I got really angry at middle schoolers for cluttering the hall playing on their phones and not paying attention, when I was told to take my SINGLE EARBUD out because I wasn't able to hear announcements or other people around me, and because administration had toyed with me the day before.

A ""buddy"" to say walked out of school because he was sick of it. That day, I was tardy because my mom got on my step-father ripe and early and offered me a ride to school, which of course led to me being half an hour late. Not the first time. I was supposed to get detention, but didn't because I din't know that they revamped nearly every rule in the handbook again. 

When my friend walked out, I could hear staff in the office talking about him. I was so stressed and tired I couldn't remember, but I, in poor judgement, said they were talking shit. So then everything from the last two weeks was blamed on me.

Letting someone do something nice nearly got me detention, and it was my fault for not getting up and riding the bus when I was promised and given a route to school, that irked me. And then administration pulling up my Snapchat screenshots from a post of Facebook publicizing some of the ridiculous rules this public high school has. It's easier to hit a vape in the hall or get high in class than it is to talk to people off-campus. And then, I was told that it was worrying that I had a friend two years older than me in senior class because of the ""age difference."" Nice. This altercation with the VP and Security Officer led to my 9th anxiety attack, or at least, what I believe was an anxiety attack, in my life. My heart was palpating, my eyes couldn't focus, a headache ensued, I was fidgeting, and it was getting harder to breathe and claustrophobic in the dreary, bland room. This happened in my dining room, twice during a family dispute, a few times between my mom and I alone, where I lost the will to fight, once going up against ""H"", who I'll explain later. He's not that big a part in this., just a little detail.

I walked out, on a short-stick. Sat back down in my class that I was now behind in, and put my head down. I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream. I couldn't do anything.

They didn't want to hear my side. They didn't want to listen. Instead, they pulled me out of class, and made me a whole another class behind, plus homework from that class stacked on 4 or 5 other subjects. 

Today, I came to school after waking up early with a weird *fire.* I felt opinionated, just, out of nowhere. I voiced why I was angry with administration. I voiced my issues at home openly. I voiced my anger with middle schoolers, and everything else, as much as I could.

I left school and din't tell anyone where I was going. I met ""Lu"" at ""Tr's"" house. We sat around. They let me vent. ""Tr"" isn't very fond of me, but was happy to have me then, and offered support if I needed to talk. That was a plus, and made me feel really nice. I didn't want to go home, so I followed ""Lu"" back to his house, and watched LinusTechTips videos along with some I had made in the past.

And then I biked home. ""Lu"" had my bike from the week prior and I rode home. I sat for less than an hour before diving into 4.5 hours of homework. 

12 hours straight to school. I had 2.5 hours to myself alone, just to try and ease off. I couldn't focus during my homework. I couldn't understand the basic formulas I had just learned. 

It just... *wasn't there*.

Last year, I battled depression and succumbed to gross practices like drinking mouthwash and cutting myself. No one ever noticed. Except for ""H"", a somewhat jock-ish type, with no real skill, just an inflated ego. He ended up being an abuser and we don't talk much or anything anymore. Every time he goes to pick a fight he knows I can get back to him.

And there's another thing. Petty anger. It's an extreme. It's one of the only motivators I have. The only *spark* I can find. Everything else is confusing, but taking down the wrong is all I can seem to do. 

In the end, I can't find anytime to be healthily selfish, and care about myself. I just *do.* I do whatever anyone expects of me. And I feel like if I could stick with it I'd be all set after high school and good. But I can't keep up with it.

&amp;#x200B;

So. What do I do. If this ends up gaining some sort of traction, I'd really love to just talk with people. I'll try to keep up if so, or even if it's just a few. I appreciate it nonetheless. Thank you.

It is 1:40 PM as I finish typing this long, long post. The current songs that have played include *Wonderful* by Everclear, *How to Save a Life* by The Fray, *High Time* by Michael Penn, *Little Lion Man* by Mumford and Sons, and *Friends and Family* by Trik Turner. Mostly Scrubs soundtrack, to be honest. 

TL;DR?

Family? Crazy. School? Almost every hour I'm awake. Hobbies? Losing faith and reach. Will to *be?* Deteriorating, fast. Music? Pretty O.K.",26Sep2019,1
55,"For a bit of context, I spent the last 6 months of my life building myself up. I was dressing myself with more care, eating more healthily, and I wouldn't have said I was happy, but I was definitely able to enjoy life. I wasn't doing things because I felt good about them or myself. I started to dress more nicely because I wanted to be able to respect myself. I never felt good about putting on clothes in the morning or eating well, I just felt kind of melancholy. I found a girl who seemed to be a perfect mirror of myself, I invested alot of time towards her, and for a while, I actually felt happy.  she ended up leaving me recently. Alot of everything I had been working with myself went away. I stopped dressing myself in the morning, just leaving the house with whatever clothes I was wearing the night before. I just began to eat fast food instead. I noticed I was sadder than I was before, and in a worse condition than I was before. I realized that  being happy wasnt what I wanted anymore. Because before I found something that made me happy, it just as easily could be taken away, and it was probably silly to chase it. Before I had met her, I was satisfied with life, it was full, but I wasn't happy, but I was never hurt. After I met her, I found it difficult to enjoy things, and I was hut and just felt empty. It's just elft me with the question, of what if i gave up on trying to seek happiness overall. What if instead I just looked to be fulfilled and make myself into something, rather than endure a cycle of, Happiness and hurt?",26Sep2019,2
56,"Stupid reoccurring suicidal thoughts (SRSTs is what I call them to soften it for myself)

I just don’t know what to do. I need advice.

I’ve been getting them since I was 7-8 years old. I’m 21 now. Most of the time I wait for them to pass, sometimes I call a hotline, only 5% of the time do I genuinely want to die. They all are absolute hell in the moment though. I sob, I genuinely feel like I want to rip my brain out and scream bloody murder, it takes all my energy to stay where I am (usually I force myself in bed) and not kill myself so I’m exhausted for at least a day or two after. I can be perfectly happy and content in all areas of my life, doesn’t matter. They happen regularly once or twice a month, I just until now haven’t recognized the ones I am able to shut down by distracting myself.

The rational side of me knows I would only cause pain to the people I love, the exhausted 5% of me wants to die and only sees myself as a disgusting parasite, that at the very least stopping the SRSTs by killing myself would be beneficial, that  I can’t have an adult life like this.

I do see a therapist around twice a month. I do well in school and have good career goals &amp; aspirations. I’ve been in love once so I know what it’s like. I want a simple life with someone, want to have kids someday nothing glamorous or fancy. I distract myself. I do what I’m supposed to and nothing stops it, it’s like when a sneeze happens- nothing can prevent them or minimize them. No matter what point in life I’m at this always makes me feel like I’m at rock-bottom. I just need advice please.

57,"This is my first reddit post and I dont really know what to say. 

When I was younger my mom had a close friend me (around 10 at the time) and her 2 daughters (14 and 16 respectively) were very close. I dont remember it that much but I do remember things getting weird, one night they were sleeping over and the older one invited me under her covers. That was the start she would feel me and I would feel her, things escalated and it evolved into more explicit sexual activity. She would ask me to eat her out and soon the younger girl would become apart of it aswell. I dont remember how long it lasted but eventually I moved away around the 2010 recession. I dont think it ever evolved into sex but the sexual activity I think lasted longer then a year. 

I blocked most of the memories out, I've never told anyone about this not even longer term partners. But I'm starting to think that it affected me pretty harshly. My mother has called me sexually greedy I'm bisexual and I've had/have a very active sex life. And after alot of self evaluation I've starting to realize I'm not right mentally. I have large mood swings I'll go a week in a demoralizing slump. I sleep 16 hours of the day and barely eat and then the next week I'll be up for 2-3 days straight and be in an amazing mood. I've been to therapy and after I moved again about a year ago I've stopped going. I dont know what's wrong with me but the week long swings have been getting longer and all these memories of stuff have been coming back up I really dont know what to do or who to talk to. And I felt like maybe telling people would help me clear my mind.

58,I was diagnosed with bipolar 2... and I found myself really looking at characteristics of the illness and forcing myself into the boxes I just didn’t quite fit into. I even got prescribed med that ended up making me feel horrible... I have always regrettable believed I have borderline personality disorder. When I see people with BPD describe their experiences and symptoms... nothing is off it is entirely on... while bipolar feels sometimes likes a stretch... idk I feel so hopeless. Is it okay for me to tell my psychiatrist that I genuinely believe it is borderline? I already lost my first doctor that diagnosed me as bipolar because he was an idiot with the computer and messed up my insurance and my billing... he definitely saw something wrong but I think it was a wrong diagnosis.. even when he asked me “is there anything you think it is?” I said no because I just wanted professional input... but the meds have ruined me and the diagnosis seems wrong.

I've been so stressed and busy this past week with more than just classes, been getting very little sleep to try and catch up, and it's crashing down on me the night before the exam.

It's 4:30 AM and the exam is at 9:30 AM so that's already not a good thing. When I say I'm ""so stressed"" I don't mean I'm wringing my hands nervously and snapping irritably at people. I mean I'm crying on-and-off in panic attack mode and irrationally considering dropping out of university and isolating myself from everyone forever. Sleep is not on the horizon. Finally admitting to myself that I do have the option to not write the exam tomorrow has been simultaneously dread-inducing and calming.

I really hate citing mental health issues — whether it's real or just perceived, I feel like people start tiptoeing around me once they know, and they don't see me as a ""real person,"" if that makes sense. Like I'm no longer someone they can be friends with, or someone a professor can hire, etc. 

My university technically has these Declaration of Absence forms we can fill out after missed assessments, and they excuse us a maximum of three times per semester, so I don't really have to give any explanation for why I'm missing the exam. But I feel like I should say something, especially because of how close I'm cutting it. I just want this all shitshow to go away ugh.

63,"I’ve been dating a girl for about two months and have learned that she suffers from depression. I myself have schizoaffective disorder so we have the whole taking meds thing in common though our situations are very different. I have nearly no symptoms anymore but even with her meds she goes through episodes of depression for 2-3 weeks at a time. She just came through one recently and I struggled to support her. So I want to ask what I can do to support her? I try to be understanding and helpful but when she’s like this I feel useless. She sends me messages about how she wants to die and she hates everything. What am I supposed to say to this? I try to help by being someone she can vent to but when I try to ask her what’s upsetting her or why she’s sad or what negative thoughts she’s thinking she says nothing she just wants to die; she’s not sad ABOUT anything, she’s just sad. I was with her in my car and another car tooted it’s horn at some lights and she started crying and saying how she hates people who toot their horn. When I ask why she just says because I hate them. It’s like a brick wall, she’s just sad and upset because she’s sad and upset. Since we can’t really talk about it because there’s nothing to talk about, I can’t help her. I mean it is selfish, I want to feel like I’m helping but it feels bad to feel like I’m useless and just have to wait it out - she said it only usually lasts 2-3 weeks.

66,"Hey, im not entirely sure where to start this off or where to even make this post but i need to know if this is normal or not, and yes, i will go into detail about it.
So to start off, i talk to myself like there’s multiple people that im talking to 24/7 nonstop, and because of that i now see the other “people” as separate people but still somehow connected back to me in some way. They have their own voices, i know how they look, i can visualize them perfectly in my head and i know everything about their personalities because some sort of way they’re all a part of my own personality. ((They take bits and pieces out of my own personality basically.))
I have gone as far as creating separate accounts on social media (mainly instagram) for my “friends” which are actually just the other “people”.
As an example one of the girls names are Blair- shes a 15-16 year old scene girl from like, myspace days. She often uses old forgotten and rather, cursed slang and likes bright, flashy, eyestrain stuff. 
They all type different, act different, everything. 
Because of this i no longer know which one is the real one in charge and i often switch between “people” without realizing until a few hours later. 
I also often vividly daydream about the “people” together as a group talking, although they all range from 10-23 age wise. 
Some of them are even different sex’s and languages, like, one is male and speaks German and is just getting out of Highschool, but im not sure of his exact age. He’s learning English and uses a translator to help him speak English properly- even though im English myself.
This has gone as far as me almost making a journal for all the different “people”, so i can write about them when im in that.. form?? Idk what word to use.

Ive googled this and all that came up was schizophrenia disorder and multiple personality disorder, but im not sure about either so i thought it’d be best to ask here.

67,"It's been a long slog trying to cure this social and general anxiety. I was diagnosed sometime during my undergraduate degree, I can't quite remember when. I've definitely been ""off"" much longer than that but that was when I first reached out. Since then I've been prescribed Setraline, Fluoxetine, Citalopram from the SSRIs and also recently Propanol. Also had two courses of therapy (9 weeks x 2). Right now I do breathing exercises, mindfulness and the doctor has referred me to therapy again.

Nothing has worked and unfortunately things have gotten much worse. I've missed about two weeks worth of work in five months. I tried to go in today but was weeping on the bus I find it so painful to be there.. will probably get fired soon who knows.

I saw the doctor yesterday, he has been really kind and sympathetic, but he said he is running out of options in terms of what he can suggest. He said all they can offer is therapy or SSRIs which hasn't worked. This has sent me into a panic. I cannot imagine living my entire life like this.",26Sep2019,2

Last friday I got my ADD diagnosis, together with some other disorders.
My psychiatrist described me 5mg of Ritalin 3 times a day, when this works off I get incredibly depressed, anxious en numb. My partner has always supported me with my mental health problems, but in my anxious and depressed state I can sometimes be quite rude to him, as I long for that happy and mellow version of myself. He accepts it and helps me along, but I cant help myself feeling guilty about it when I recover from that down state of mind.

When he was talking it was like he was completely reading my mind and saying exactly how I felt.

72,"I'm M 21. Been through a lot since childhood: bullied, harassed, verbally and physically abused by family, you name it, though I still managed to have a happy school life. Now I'm a recluse with no friends as I've gotten away from all of them. 

I've been facing some issues recently and all I got is invalidation from people I trusted the most. I'm old but I haven't even been to university as I struggled to get the marks I needed. I was an A student but as I'm getting older, I become lazier and dumber each day. I have been working part time but I have switched jobs every year because I'm too sensitive from all the bullying. 

This is probably not new to all of you but I feel like I'm raised to become a weak man, your typical weak GenZ kid. Everyone is moving on with their lives and yet, I find myself stuck in the same spot where I was 5 years ago. It doesn't help that I have a porn addiction. I've been trying to make a difference for myself, trying to be better through working out, keeping myself busy, but I always tend to fall back to where I started from.

This is really embarrassing but now I noticed that I talk to myself a lot in my mind,in my room. Sometimes I even act out those imaginary conversations with the people who bullied me; the same conversations I had with them years ago rolling repeatedly in my head as if I'm still talking to them.

73,"I've suffered depression and anxiety for quite a while. I'm mostly waiting until all of this is over. However, I function.

I have to fight my laziness and anxiety every day, but I usually manage. I have ""brain fog"" but my performance is still good. I change my shirt multiple times a day because of anxiety sweating, and I disinfect my mouth and nails when I bite too much. My pulse spikes every time I'm outside or using public transport, but I make it on time, usually far too early. Sometimes I feel like having a heart attack, but after it's over I don't care much about it. I know it's just anxiety, and even if it wasn't, I'd be fine.

I'm pretty sure I've always had ADHD. I can't manage time at all, or focus, or organize my thoughts. I'm doing pretty well on paper , so I have no reason to complain.

What I'm supposed to tell my psychiatrist? I'm sure he feels like I'm wasting his time. I'm uplifting, smiling and joking, so it probably sounds like I'm attention seeking when I mention depression or suicide. I don't have any other mode really.

Of course I could take psych meds again to feel better. But there is no rational reason, is there? I could as well drink alcohol or do drugs. I took ADs and anxiety meds in the past, but what's the point if I can do without? My family and most therapists I knew are against meds. There are good reasons and risks.

If I ask myself should I do it? No. I just don't know if I'm being wise and rational to avoid the dangers, or if I'm just looking to punish myself and *pretending* to be rational? As I said, I function sufficiently. But all of this may push me towards the edge. But then fixing it with drugs can't be solution. Then just... fall down the edge I guess? Face reality or die trying? I feel like I'm losing my mind. I would like a simple answer: Go drug yourself up, go work yourself to death, go die. Something like that.

Here is some background info: I'm a student from Singapore. And this isn't the first time I've looked at my body in disgust.

The oldest memory I could recall this feeling  would be when I was 13. My mom and aunts like to poke fun of me saying that I was a ""pig"" and had ""cow legs"". They have been doing it since I was 10. I was and still am of healthy weight, but I felt that my mom and aunts were right. I felt fat and disgusting. I ended up restricting my calorie intake and exercised a lot. I felt hungry all the time. I cried every night looking at the mirror.

My mom noticed and put a stop to it (she threatened to throw me into a mental institution if I didn't stop, and destroyed all my calorie logging books). Maybe she felt guilty or something I don't know. 

But now I'm starting to feel that my body is fat and disgusting. I don't want to go back to the time when I was 13. I've started to eat less and lesser, even though I don't want to, and I feel embarrassed when I'm eating in school, as I feel that people are laughing at me for eating. I can't help it.

I have voices that constantly conflict telling me to retaliate, to lose control, I end up harming myself so I don't project onto others, then I have louder voices diffusing me with derogatory statements and convictions, they are the ones that are the loudest, they impair me and back me into a corner.

I'm my brains gimp, an absolute bitch to this involuntary never-ending loathing. 

I look at myself at every reflective surface hoping for a miracle and wound up in despair, its obsessive. I have a constant knot in my throat, tension in my head, the constant fight between crying or spite. 

These days I'd rather looked pissed and unapproachable than unleash my sadness unto the world. I fear projecting my pitiful nature, exposing it has only had me abused and used.

81,"Yesterday my grandpa hung himself. 

I always thought it was getting better with him after my grandma died 2 years ago. Before this he lied all day on the sofa and did nothing but watching TV. After the death of my grandma he looked better, he made himself food, washed his own clothes (things I didn't do when I was depressive), do gardening work, did go shopping etc.

We found out, he was really desperate to get his old life back. He wanted another woman that did all for him. He did go to meetups for older singles, but the woman there want to go out and search a partner that want to go with them. So he didn't found one there. (The thing with the meetups was something we knew, but not how desperate he was and what kind of woman he searched)

Then he read an classified ad in the newspaper about a company that conveys you a new partner. This company (I really would like to write their name(s) here, but being the malicious guys they are, it's better not to) is pretty much a scam and my grandpa, which didn't use the internet once in his lifetime and being in such desperation fell for it. He contacted them and they drove to him (their hq, that might be a letterbox company, is 460 km away) and forced him to pay them 2000€ cash (they drove my grandpa to the next atm) for their ""services"". 

This was ok, my grandpa thought, he would get a woman for this money, that will satisfy his needs. But, when they sent him another bill of 2500€, he pretty much realised that he was scammed. And being a man that understands himself as some kind of streetsmart, thrifty and unscammable, this destroyed his self-view completely and brought himself from depressive to suicidal. And yesterday he did it.

We found the bill and after doing my research many of their contracts are not quite legal (in the meaning that if you sign them you don't have to stick to them) and they lost several cases about this. Also what they did (forcing one to pay money) might be illegal (in Germany it's called Nötigung and you can to jail for up to 3 years because of it)

My parents spoke with their lawyer and he will write a letter to the company, that states, that my grandpa killed himself because of this and their bill will not be paid. 

I do wish the very worst for them, even though I know, that depression is really strong in our family. My uncle is depressive and I was depressive, but recovered from it 90%. Sometimes I get flashbacks, so I don't really like to talk about it too much.) I feel so much hate for these people, because I roughly (ofc you can't compare your own exp to others) know how he felt and in which misery he was, and they thought, it would be a good idea to make some money.

It's a gift I gave myself having had been in disbelief that certain sufferings were a result of my illness as doctors tried to lead me to believe.  

So for the people who feel weighed down by the gravity of medication, avoid going into episodes by coming off meds despite doctors orders as I did.  

Do however fight without relent to get on something that doesn't make you feel too many side effects.  

Trust doctors will eventually find something appropriate.  

Never give up hopeful outlook towards your mental health.  

But most of all, you have one life, and living out 'the Night of the Living Dead' will never compare to feeling emotion!",26Sep2019,1

There's a LOT going on in my life right now (some of which I legit have no control over), I've had depression, anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD for decades now, and I'm clearly in complete burnout. The problem is, I know the solution is self-care and conserving my resources for myself. But I literally don't know how to do that. I don't WANT anything. I don't want to DO anything, GO anywhere, SEE anyone. Even 'bandaid' things, like retail therapy or even a drink, which I know is the worst idea ever. I don't even want to binge watch mindless TV. My favorite foods don't appeal so I can't really treat myself. How do you exercise self-care when you're so burned out you have no idea what self-care looks like for you?

102," I've just read some comments where people discussed how pets dealing with people depression.

I have bipolar disorder and anxiety. So, depressions for me, it was a common thing. But I always look for ways to handle it. It's not my life. I choose how to live and I want to be happy.

I found one research. This review suggests that pets provide benefits to those with mental health conditions. ([Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5800290/) to it). I always dreamed to adopt a dog. But I like traveling and my parents live in another state. So, I understood the disadvantage of adopting a pet. I can't take him with me.

However, a few months ago, I found a solution like an Emotional Support Animal. Unlike a service animal, an emotional support animal doesn’t need to be trained to perform specific tasks. So, I need to prove my depression by a doctor or a service. I've checked all info that I fit this program and able to travel with my dog across the US.

I adopted my Dexter next day. Everything was in my hands. Found [a service](https://www.takeyourpeteverywhere.com/) where I can take an ESA letter and visit a vet center with him and get approved him to be my Emotional support.

How do I feel now after adopting him?

I don't feel loneliness and anxiety has dropped down. I feel happy when I saw him and take care of him. It's like parenting.

Yes, you have to walk with him, to feed him but you have to break your negative thoughts and adopt a pet: cat, dog, bird, etc. You will feel happy.

103,"Thankyou everyone for your support with my post the other day. Unfortunately my anxiety is getting worse and my so called ""friends"" aren't helping. 
Over the last two days I've had 2 friends message me and I thought things where improving. I thought maybe these 2 friends actually cared. But no... Of course they just wanted something from me. That's apparently all I'm good for. 

One of them was a close friend, I mentioned her in the last post. She asked me for £70 while I was in hospital. Well she messaged me to apologize for asking. And then proceeded to tell me how much she needs it and how desperate she is. Usually I would lend her anything without question, but she hasn't been in touch the entire time I have been ill and when she messaged about money she still didn't ask how I was, even though she knew I'd been ill. 

The second friend is someone who I don't speak to much we kind of drift into each others lives which is fine. But at the moment my mental health is in the toilet and I told her as much, she seemed to care and we made plans, turns out she just messaged me because she wants me to make her some herbal cookies for pain relief. 
Why do all my friends just use me? It's not fair I am nothing but nice to all of them, if they're I'll I check in on them or visit them, and it's never reciprocal.

I have decided to start saving for a Good sunlight lamp for my seasonal affective disorder. I currently can’t find any around me and have turned to Amazon for help, but I am struggling to find one that I can inquire to someone’s personal experiences.. reviews are often mixed and I don’t want to blow cash on something not great.

If anyone is Australia based, do they know a good outlet for SAD lamps? Do they go by any other names?

Alternatively, are there any lesser known tips for combatting the mood drops?

The questionnaire had asked for the reason, so I put “mood/personality disorder evaluation and treatment” to convey that I was seeking a diagnosis and then treatment. They called this morning and the woman condescendingly asked “So personality disorder... have you been diagnosed?” and I said “No I just wanted an evaluation on mood and personality disorders to get treatment” and she replied, “So what made you come up with this diagnosis for yourself?” taken aback because I never claimed to have a specific disorder I said “Oh I am wanting a diagnosis, I haven’t self diagnosed anything. I want to speak with a psychologist to be evaluated for mood and personality disorders and then receive a diagnosis from them”. She continued to be condescending and made me feel like I had submit the wrong thing or like I was seeking something abnormal and finally gave me a reference to another office.

So I recently saw a new psych doctor (new insurance) and my mind has been reeling over the whole experience since then. Just curious for opinions on it, trying to see if it’s just me or not.      Small Backstory: From age 13-17 I was a troubled kid. Victim of sexual assault on more than 5 occasions, lots of drugs, homelessness, and I was frequently locked up in juvenile detention centers, rehabs, and mental hospitals.  Flash forward 10 years (I’m 27 now) and all things considered I’d say 10 decent years of life without any major issues, no major mood or relationship issues, one daughter, happily married, and a career in construction that I love. 
    So I walk into my appointment (unfortunately visibly anxious, as I’ve had some shitty experiences with any and all doctors over the past few months) and I sit down in a room with this male doctor, who was NOT who I’d made the appointment with (I very SPECIFICALLY said I wanted a female doctor). He was very quick to talk over me as I was speaking/answering his questions, talk AT me, and shove a fat stack of papers and testing at me. I told him that before I add any or adjust my current medications, that I’d like to see an endocrinologist first. He brushed me off saying that his “welll probably not, we’ll see, my tests will tell all” . Ok fine, the testing is fine, but don’t brush me off, you don’t have access to my medical files! Then he said, “ if I had to bet/guess, my initial clinical diagnosis would be Recurring Major Depressive Disorder, Borderline Personality disorder, Bipolar or Bipolar 2, PTSD, and ADHD.”  I just thought, wtf? This dude just read my chart from other doctors in my past and just thinks he’s being smart. Turns out, he used to work at College Hospital, one of the inpatient hospitals I was in as a child, and when I received all of those diagnoses. Problem is, College hospital never once did a drug screening on me. I was as high as damn kite back then! How can you properly diagnose someone when that someone is high on meth? I’m in no way saying that I don’t have issues, and I absolutely deal with recurring depression/anxiety, and I fit my PTSD diagnosis to an absolute T. I’m still undecided on the ADHD, as difficulty concentrating can be a symptom of nearly every mental health disorder.    Unfortunately I have to go back to see this asshat so I can finish filing for disability at the very least.      Anyway, just I’m just looking for opinions or personal experiences related to this, or shitty doctors that you’ve come across as well, I feel like I’m gaslighting myself over this, and it’s just making everything worse for me rn.

My parents convinced me I didn’t need it, I sort of coped with it and listened to their advice of not taking it. 

It’s is now 2019. My life has taken a dramatic shift and I can’t think straight. I’m at a pivotal time in my life, I’m in position I’ve never dreamt myself of being in.

My financial situation makes things worse. Currently I have just enough money to buy food. My job is an on campus one, and doesn't pay a whole lot. I wish I could see a good therapist but I can't afford it. I went to the free on campus therapists and they didn't really take me seriously. It made me feel worse in the end, so I quit going.

For fuck's sake, I'm in a mad house with doctors interogating me all the time, stressed out all over my head, terrified to death and regretting everything in my life, at least let me smoke in the yard and listen to shitty songs and tell jokes and stories with the other kids. She thinks that I'm treating everything as a joke, but god I wished so. I would love to not be able to understand the circumstances, but I do, even better than her. And now after we went to bed, after she made me feel like a bug and steal all my happiness from the rest of the day in just an hour she has the audacity to ask me why the fuck am I crying in the middle of the night. If you are going to stress me more than this fucking hospital and make me hate myself more than I fucking do already at least let me cry that out.",26Sep2019,16
135,"  

So it happened, I broke down. I knew this would happen some day but I always was afraid of this day.  During the day It looked like I was perfectly fine, but when I came home I nearly dropped down from crying…

I’m a 17 year old student at a high school. The past few years have been though, Nearly all my friends left me, I got beaten up a couple times and nobody helped me (even though my ‘friend’ was just watching, Got my first heartbreak - although that’s my own fault, And when I finally thought everything was getting better because I met someone who was a real friend, he had to leave for good reasons, and I was alone again.

Every day I could pretend and think I could become someone later, and there still are people who would miss me if I were gone, but I was wrong. Today became clear to me that nobody gives a sh\*t about me. I got sick for a few days, not even one of my ‘friends’ asked where I was or how I was doing. The only one who asked was my mother. When I came home, I just couldn’t handle it anymore all my feelings from the past years came up and I broke down. I feel as shit now.

The only thing I want in my life is someone who will bet here for me in though times, and for who I can do the same, someone who I can hang out with while trusting them. Someone who I can call a friend. But I’m starting to believe that I’m unable to reach this. I’ve tried multiple things to feel better: Going to the gym, eating more healthy, volunteering, work,… But nothing made me feel better, I just kept feeling like shit and unworthy to feel luck and almost everyday that feeling grows. And in all honesty I don’t know how long I can hold this. I know I need someone to share my feelings with, but I have nobody. The only ones who I could trust enough are my parents, but they are the ones I want to hide this from the most as they probably would look different to me and I don’t want to give them more problems to take care of. A psychologist is also not possible since everyone would ask why. That’s why I guess I wrote it here, just so I could share it somewhere. So here I am desperately in my room behind a PC typing this, crying alone.

Thank you for reading this and sorry for my bad English.",26Sep2019,2
136,I’m a pretty lonely junior in high school I know it’s sad but I have adhd which really fucks me up socially. I am really funny at least to the little people I talk to but whenever I come home I’m alone with pretty evil parents that are both on a constant comedown from meds. However when I do things like listen to music there’s this underlying feeling that many people are watching me jam out and it’s very comforting. Anyone ever heard of this before.,26Sep2019,1
137,"I never trusted therapists much to begin with, it just doesn't seem to me like someone who's paid for 'caring' will actually care much. 

Anyway, I've had my fair share of experiences with therapists, I've been to three for more than six months each, the other ones, another 5,  were in mental hospitals. Out of those one and a half were ones I liked. My first therapist hugged me 'because she felt so sorry for me', I stopped going after that. The second one was okay, but not very qualified and absolutely clueless when it came to assessing the severity of my condition. The third one was an arrogant know-it-all without any empathy, also not being able to make decisions when I was too ill to make them myself (regarding suicidality).

I'm leaning towards just writing all of them off and trying to deal with it by myself again (hasn't worked in the past, but going to therapy hasn't either so what's the difference). 

Anyone been in a similar situation/mindset; any advice?",26Sep2019,1
138,"Essentially anything he asks me to do I welcome doing it, but yet find away to either bitch about it or find some way to point out I did it wrong. And I'm getting close to loosing my cool but would rather not. It goes like this..

I blew up his car because of a shop error and felt the need to accept responsibility and replace it and do the labour for free with supplied parts. He set all these expectations such as, wanted to spend no more then 3 grand and I came in under 2 grand on the car certified. For the last five months I've heard nothing but him bitch and complain about this car like it never ends. The car I blew up I got 1200 back from the shop, the new car I got a grand off and landed it for 1800. So 1200 minus 1800 makes it 600 for the car. Parts were maybe 600 and I did 1500 in labour free of charge. But yet I just keep getting told its a piece of shit and he's incredibly ungrateful for what I did to ease the stress.

The next thing is, I'm on disability for my mental health, so I take it on myself to do most of the house work. If I miss something on a single dish, he complains to me, instead of being thankful about it. Then brings it up when a normal person who just put it in the sink and forget about it.

I've told him three times now don't use my towels on the bathroom floor as our toilet is beside the tub. He continues to do so, I do laundry once a month and like to leave them hung up in the bathroom not my bedroom on the floor.

I spend most of my time in my room, because anytime I watch tv or listen to music in the living room. He kicks me off his tv for the soul fact it's his and he wants it now. When I listen to music and he gets home, immediately I'm told to turn it off even if he's playing video games and it shouldn't matter. This also includes if I'm playing my switch in the living room he tells me to turn the volumes off, again if he's playing games as well.

He eats my food, and when I grab even a chip or maybe a can of pop it's a big fucking deal and I should ask, yet he doesn't at all when he eats my shit.

I was dating a girl who had a kid, and when she left after the second time her daughter was over. He said I don't want her kid here. Yet his friend has two boys and it's totally cool for them to come over anytime. 

He does drugs in my house I used to abuse and doesn't find an issue with that. 

He essentially only says anything to me when he needs something. Other day I came home and instead of saying hello, it was can you do that for me now. 

I picked a car part up he neededx and charged me gas.. Or I dd for him as I'm clean and also tried to say I should put gas in. 

Am I fucking crazy or is he just being an ungreatful douche? Like it's insane the amount shit he bitches about. Yet since I got clean I have like an incredible amount of patience and besides the towels never say shit. Don't say anything when his gf is over all week, don't say anything when ppl party at my house, like quite literally don't say shit about anything he does. I pay half the bills and this is how I'm treated on a ongoing basis and have been for almost 6 months now.",26Sep2019,1

140,"Well my boss is 69yo, has a family and a good amount of money. I've been working to his company for 5 years, he always complained from what he listens in the news. At the beginning i used to participate in the discussion because i though the purpose of a brainstorm then i realized he was just releasing a lot of toxicity. ""You see how this shitty country is?"" it all goes around the same, even if me or my co-workers present facts he either feels contradicted or goes around to a topic with a negative impact. What he wants to prove? I don't know but it's like he lives all the situations.

The business is related with paperwork but it's most likely in the small warehouse reserved to storage paper, you'll find tired, pieces of furniture, wood, motorcycles, tools, cables almost a junk yard. He gets very attached to it keeps the things years and after some time he releases space and the cycle returns of accumulating.

Recently i've notice, he stopped to read and refused to do the basic tasks he once did, always postpones or asks to third parties to do it, people that not even belong to the company, risking to lose a client. He counts how much toilet paper is spent by the employees, so people started to throw the paper by the sink, since he didn't see any used paper on the basket then he forbidden the throw of paper throw the toilet because it might get clogged, also counts how many towels are used per week to dry the hands (he pays the same if it's one or five). Some weeks ago he decided that every office cabinet must be always closed because it gets dust (we close it by the end of the workday obviously but he now wants everything closed even during work time), if it gets opened by a few minutes well he starts a huge discussion about it.

He is most of the time pissed with an angry face, unavailable to work (he is in charge of doing the outside work and it's crucial for us to receive of send documents), if we ask someone else to do the favour he gets mad.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody questions him not even the people who he keeps asking favours. It's like everyone don't care or are afraid of him. Among my peers i feel the tension and how they simply don't like him and talk badly on his back.

He also refuses to meet with people who will question him technical stuff about the work we do or that he knows they are not submissive.

It left a scar on how terrible some men are for me. This also doesn't help because I went into therapy because of my step dad who beat and abused me for being bisexual and trans.

142,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 6 years, living together for 1. Overall our relationship is okay, with fights and stuff of course, nothing’s ever perfect. We both graduated college around the same time but there’s a bit of an age gap between us. We also both started being working professionals last year. It’s a hard adjustment for both of us and I think we’re both still learning how to balance our work lives and our private lives. 

The problem is I think it’s causing him to feel depressed to be at a job he doesn’t like and living at home with his parents who he also doesn’t like (we both live with his parents). He also doesn’t really have any friends, but he hasn’t really for the whole time I’ve known him. Recently it’s harder to get him to eat enough and he doesn’t even do hobbies anymore. He just reads about work and thinks about work. Personal hygiene is also becoming non-existant for him and he’s gained weight for the first time in his adult life basically. He’s upset about the weight thing as well. 

I’ve tried to talk to him about getting professional help because while I’m happy to talk to him about things that are bothering him, I’m not in the best space mentally either and haven’t been for awhile but I try to keep it to myself as much as I can. Recently we talked about how it’s me that’s been a problem so he’s asked me to lose weight, dress better, clean up around our shared space more, exercise more, make more friends, do more hobbies, etc. I’m trying really hard to do all those things, but is that really going to help anything? I know it’s the job and the house that’s his main problem, so not sure why everything gets directed back to me...

I guess I want to know what I can do to help him without also sending myself over the edge...I have to get back to work so apologies if this post is kind of all over the place.",26Sep2019,1
143,"Hopefully this is the best place to put this. Sorry, I know it's long and rambly.  

This time last year, I left what was supposed to be ""the dream job"" in my career field because of a god awful work environment and burnout. It got to the point where all I did was work and then drink when I was off the clock. It was the sort of place that expected people to work overtime for free. I've only been at this job for six month, but it was killing my passion for photography/videography. A part of me wishes I kept a list of all the crap and to show people and other business on how NOT to do video in your newsroom. I didn't enjoy the city I was living in because of work and I didn't get out of the apartment except for work. 

I contemplated suicide and I just stopped caring. 

My boyfriend (now husband) saw the signs and told me to quit. I was scared at first. Everyone had been so proud of me when I told everyone I got this job. I kept thinking if I just toughened up that it would get better. I never stopped and thought about taking care of my mental health when I really should've. 

 I was a mess, honestly.  

It was honestly the most terrifying thing I've ever done. I've always done what the ""proper"" thing to do was and leaving a big, snazzy job was not the ""proper"" thing to do. But I did it. 

After I left, I got diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. Apparently the burnout and bad environment irritated some trauma I had from earlier in life and triggered it. That's the short version of what my therapist said when I got diagnosed.  

It's not been an easy year. Not drinking was weirdly hard for me and I still crave an drink after a long day. Figuring out how to take care of yourself mentally when you haven't ever done it, is hard. I came from a family that kind of ignores mental health so I was new (I have a little sister who is bipolar and she's been helping me too). I didn't know that I could switch to a different therapist if I wasn't comfortable with them until I got on this sub. I'm going to be starting on medications next month and I'm super nervous about that. 

But you know what? I've picked up the camera again. I'm slowly, but surely getting back into it. I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to a newsroom again. I'm weary with the idea of giving a bit corporate  organization my time and energy again, but I'm picking it up. 

The good days are starting to outnumber the bad. I'm becoming more confident with the idea of going freelance. I'm even slowly going back to working out. 

It takes time, but it gets better. There are days where I still want to just stay in bed and hide from the world. The days where I just cry and I hate myself so much. There are days when I still call my sister because I'm thinking of self harm (not to kill myself, but more like...replacing the mental pain with physical if that makes sense). It's a day to day bases, but I'm so grateful that I finally stopped and took care of myself. I didn't realize how much I was loved until I stopped to take care of myself. 

So I wanted to tell you, it gets better. You are loved and needed. I know how hard it is to fight that feeling of drowning, but keep going.",26Sep2019,5

But when my depression isn't really bad I seem to think it's not worth it as I wouldn't have a reason to be there but when it is it's hard enough trying to cope without adding the stress of going to some stranger for help.

147,"I'm a 19 year old girl. I've struggled with depression since I was 11 - 12 years old. My parents divorced when I was a toddler, I was exposed to many of their nasty fights, and I've since had a bad relationship with both of my parents.

I used to be anorexic from 2016 - 2018, and I suffered from severe anxiety that I took meds for. It's been almost a year since I've stopped my medication, and safe to say my anxiety - at least the physical symptoms - are a whole lot better.

Lately I've been feeling like something is really terribly wrong with me.

For starters, I cannot stand being alone. Most of my friends live abroad and I don't really have people to hang out with. My boyfriend (24M) meets me every day and we spend a good chunk of time together - anywhere from 4 to 12 hours, I sometimes stay at his place too. If we have a fight and he doesn't talk or want to see me, I literally go crazy. I cry, I scream, I storm around on the street, I go to places where he might be just so I might have a chance of seeing him, i feel so horrible and so miserable, it feels so unbearable. Why? Because the loneliness is too much for me. I cannot stand it. I am so attached to him. I often dream that he and I can just spend the whole day cuddling in bed because in my life that's really the one thing that makes me feel good. I know it's unrealistic but it's a thought that often comes to my head when I'm with him.

Secondly, I cannot seem to control my anger at all. If something makes me angry, it's really really impossible for me to calm down. When I'm angry, I do things that I would not normally, and it always ends in disaster. I drink recklessly, I do hard drugs (which I'm very much against actually, but my anger makes me forget that these are things I hold in disgust), I put myself in risky situations, I smash things, I throw things, I make scenes on the road, I get violent, I scream, I get in trouble with the cops. 

I also have a tendency to want to take revenge.

Last month my boyfriend did something that really pissed me off and hurt me. I wanted to make him feel as bad as I did. I went to have a drink with some people he doesn't like, cause I knew he'd be furious. I wanted to get even. I ended up drinking myself to oblivion, and got sexually assaulted. It was horrible. That was the first time I realized that i had a problem, that acting out of my anger leads to horrible consequences. Now when we fight, I think twice about taking revenge because of what happened. The thoughts still fill my head tho. To pop his tires, to trash his room - petty thoughts of revenge. 

Also, I cannot for the life of me hold a job. I've been employed in three companies this year - got fired from the first two, quit the last one out of my own accord. I don't understand what happens. When I first get the job, I'm happy as fuck and productive and hopeful. I'm punctual, put in lots of effort, do all the work really fucking well, stay extra hours. Fast forward about a month, and I start to taper off. 

Even if the pay is decent, even if my coworkers are fun, even if I like the work I do, even if I get great benefits - somehow or another, I get fucking bored. I lose interest and motivation. I get really sick of waking up at the same time, doing the same shit, every single day. I start coming in late, being half-assed with my work, skipping work to get drunk, showing up hungover, etc. 

This boredom is not exclusive to just my career. I constantly get terribly bored with my daily life. I'm mostly okay with it, but at some point, I just snap, and I get so sick of doing the same things all the time. I start desiring new, exciting, different things. I get so fed up, and the boredom is so overwhelming that I feel suicidal. I hate waking up, I hate going to sleep, it feels like there is nothing to look forward to. The things I usually love doing become tedious and a chore. I have strong tendencies to smoke weed those days, spend a lot  (which I can't do because I'm always broke), and to engage in sexual acts in public (which my boyfriend never agrees to) to get some excitement. It's a small ass boring town and there's nothing to do here. The funny thing about this boredom is it never lasts. I would feel like this and suddenly it just wears off.

I'm usually a very confident person most of the time. I'm confident in my appearance, put a lot of effort into looking nice, and I like my body. I'm no longer skinny like I was when I suffered from anorexia, I'm at a healthy weight and it's never felt so good. I love flaunting my body, I love buying new clothes and makeup to doll myself up, and I love the compliments and attention I get. And all this positive energy reflects onto others too - I love hyping my friends and other people up, complimenting them when they look nice or what I like about them, offering to do makeup, etc etc. This is how I am like, 80% of the time. 

And then, suddenly, one day I'll look into the mirror and out of nowhere, I hate what I see. I don't understand how it happens. Suddenly all I see are flaws. I feel disgusting and hideous. I become the polar opposite of my usual self. I start avoiding going out. If I have no choice, I'd wear clothes that disguise my body. I feel awful if anyone does as much as look in my direction. I hate everything about myself. I become bitter about others as well, all the positive energy drains away, I feel jealous and inadequate. I compare myself to others, weigh in their strengths with my weaknesses, make myself feel like absolute ugly shit. Every outfit I try is the wrong outfit. Every hairstyle is wrong. Every lipstick shade is wrong. I'm very insecure at times like this. 

But as suddenly as these feelings come, they just disappear. And leave me wondering why on earth I was feeling and behaving that way.

Can someone please help me understand what's going on with me? I feel horrible and I'm messing up my life. I'm so sick of these horrible thoughts and emotions.",26Sep2019,1
148," it's getting worse lately and doctors appointments take like a month to book, so i wanted to post here first.

Basically I constantly constantly (several times a day, every few minutes especially on my own) reconnect something to a bad memory. Not any bad memory in particular, mostly things I've forgotten about. It can be really minor things.

And every time it happens I shout out ""I hate you"" to myself. It's pathetic, I'm worried about people hearing me so I change you to unicorns. whatever.

It's not severe, it's not disabling, but it's so frequent all the fucking time. i was watching a cooking video earlier and the guy was cooking zucchini and i remembered i don't like zucchini and then thought about the one time I had it and it was when i was at an exes' house and they were having a barbecue like six years ago, and how her family didn't like me and yeah. simple stuff like that. it happens all the time. at home. while i'm outside walking. it happens a lot.

149,"Today I had an intake to see a couple's therapist with my partner.

The session went well and we agreed on getting to a point where he no longer uses screaming or name-calling as a goal, along with resolving conflicts through cooperation.

We scheduled the next appointments and left. A few hours later, I received a call from the therapist that because I have a history of trauma, I shouldn't be in counseling with my SO, and she said she would no longer see us.

I get super depressed and will curl up and cry. But then the next day I go and do the same thing or act like a dickhead. Why did I turn out and think it's ok to do these things? Is this something that is normal? Can someone offer an insight because I am losing my mind right now. Literally. I am on the verge of snapping.",26Sep2019,1
160,"I'm late 20s and in a good job. Have a great partner. 

The last few weeks has been the worst of what I've felt throughout 20s. For no particular reason I can pin, occasionally I feel a total lack of drive and shut myself off from the world. Eat terribly, don't exercise. And just feel a bit shit. Recently it got so bad I've not been going to work. Haven't been fired as remote working is kind of accepted. But don't really want to do anything.

My partner is frustrated as I end up being a sad sap. The advice mostly is to excercise and eat well...but I'm finding it hard to even do that. 

Am I indulging and wallowing in negative emotion? What can I do to break the pattern? 

I booked a therapist for this week, by people close to me surprisingly got a little frustrated I haven't taken the basic health and fitness steps first. For me it was the actionable step I could take",26Sep2019,1
161,"TW: Dieting

So my mom sets unreasonable standards for herself, in every aspect of her life, and is very much a perfectionist, so this stems from that. But she’s been dieting lately. She’s been restricting herself from certain foods and alcohol and “cheating” certain times and consuming them anyway. Recently she casually told me she’s meeting with a weight coach. I’m worried. She thinks she lacks in all aspects of her life (when working, she should do more household tasks, when off work, she should work more etc.) Her dieting and going to see a weight coach worries me, because I think it is only going to enforce her idea of being not good enough, but she is. And now she’s gonna have an external voice echoing her internal struggle, and it worries me! 
If you tell her she’s good enough/ deserves a break/ shouldn’t be so hard on herself, she just snaps at me that I don’t know what it’s like and have no idea of what a position she is in...  except I feel like I’ve struggled with the same things, I just have years of therapy now behind me.",26Sep2019,2
162,"I have a question. So my friend had been diagnosed several times bipolar I w/th psychotic features years ago and have had 8 hospitalizations as a result. They had their most recent manic episode right before their pregnancy. They had to go off their medication more recently due to pregnancy and extended breastfeeding. They have now been med free for three years. However, despite the statistics and all saying that bipolar 1 people relapse off meds, their symptoms have been very very mild.  Will the bipolar 1 come back? Why did their symptoms remit for such a long time?",26Sep2019,1
163,"mental health and productivity/fitness: a journey. 


i’m not sure if this post is allowed here, so if it isn’t please tell me where i can take it. 

without going into a lot of detail, i (like many others) have had a very short life that has been chock full of bad times. 

now, still at a young age, am on track to getting married, and moving states. i’m trying to get regular on medication and get fit and healthy. 

see, a year ago, i was doing well. my mental state was the best it’s ever been, i was eating well, i had a decent muscle/body fat ratio, i operated on a nice schedule, and had a relatively balanced life. it was all fucked up by some shitty guy that i trusted a little too much. after that, i slowly stopped going to the gym at all. got lazy. stopped cleaning. my hygiene suffered. i started eating fast food for every meal. never came home. essentially, my life fell apart. and now, a year later. i’m 30 pounds heavier, and i have no muscle at all. i’m tired of it. i’m tired of my house being a disaster. i’m tired of hating my reflection. i’m tired of feeding my body shit. i’m tired of letting my bills suffer due to spending on food when we have groceries. i want to look good again. i want to feel good again. and i’m going to. 

i want to document this journey. talk about the things that no one seems to. things like the anxiety that i feel looking for new foods in the grocery store, pacing through the aisles because i won’t ask for help, and leaving with the same unhealthy things i always get because of it. like the relationship with food deep depression has given me. 

i can’t afford a therapist, i can’t keep a journal to save my life. i need an outlet to put my emotions on a chalkboard. to talk about it all at a distance, as if i’m explaining to someone else why /they/ feel that way. 

so i came to the conclusion that i should start a blog, or a youtube channel, or maybe just post to reddit. i want to post my progression from unhealthy to healthy, from unhappy to happy. i want something that forces me to stay on track, and if i don’t, i have a way to explain why i did and how to avoid it. 

the issue is, i don’t think i can. or maybe i don’t think i should. what if nobody watches? do i even care? am i good enough at speaking? maybe i’m not comfortable with that. can i even motivate myself enough to stay consistent? i’m full of uncertainty. 

what i need is for someone to talk me up or talk me down. someone to tell me this is a good idea, or a stupid one. someone to help me understand what it means to do that. i just don’t know. i have a fiancé to support it. but what does any of it mean if nobody watches? if nobody cares? i just want the bullshit i went through to mean something.",26Sep2019,1
164,"If this isn't allowed please delete it.
As the title says I had a pretty bad experience with the mental health system where I live and I think it might've traumatised me in some way. Obviously if it did that makes it pretty damn hard to resolve my issues and I don't what to do because I don't trust any doctors or medical professionals and the like here. It just makes trying to work out what's going on in my head a lot more difficult because I don't think I'll actually be able to get a definitive answer which just kind of makes it worse and it's bad enough already. I don't know enough about mental to health to actually say whether actually was or not and I feel kind of like an ass posting this but I just don't know what to do.",26Sep2019,3
165,"I'm a married father of 3 kids in the military which doesn't help the situation at all. My wife has been suffering from deep depression going on 3 years now that I know of. Shes now  living with her mom to get help but is not receiving much at all. Her mom has a kids of her own with a diffrent man other than my wife's father and one of them is fairly young only a year older then our oldest. There also on a very strict diet for health reasons. I feel like she's dug in too deep to all there health and natural path ways. She has a vision but kids are kids and she thinks shes ruining them by yelling sometimes and having mental breakdowns which only makes it worse. She wants to homeschool but doesnt have the mental capacity too right now to deal with 3 young children, so that eats at her. I'm running out of ideas I've been there with her through all this. We've been together since 2009. She said she has always felt like this.  Idk where to go shes been and is currently in therapy. Doesnt want to take any medicine or live with any other family cause her and her mom agree on the diet thing. Doesnt wanna come back here cause the kids are in a more alternative schooling there which goes with her beliefs if there were to go to school. Sorry if this is written terrible I'm not much of a wordsmith just trying to get some help or answers from somebody who's been thru this looking in like or from the inside.",26Sep2019,2
166,"I've been living on no-sleep/really few hours of sleep/nightmares for over couple of months. I'm stressing because of schools big exams going on and I'm struggling to survive financially. My two bunnies are keeping me awake even more, because I'm so sensitive to any noise if I'm trying to sleep.

Because of my bad experiences with sleeping, I nowadays get anxiety attacks in the evenings and every time I go to bed. I've also developed a continuing itching on my other foot because of stress and there's no lotion I haven't tried to even numb it for minutes, it always comes back even worse. Thanks to that I've scratched it until theres blood.

I live on my own for the first time in my life and it really has shown me it's ups and downs. It's been really hard trying to manage everything on my own. Sometimes even days go by when I won't make a warm meal for myself, because I'm so tired. Going back to home isn't an option thought, because of my abusive mom. 

My history isn't sweet. I've had a pretty normal childhood, if one would think getting bullied in every school you've been is normal. I have had only few friends for my whole life, and many have stabbed my back eventually. While being bullied at school, I also got bullied and tossed to thrash at home, by my mom. If the bullies did not already fuck me over mentally, my mom made me absolutely miserable. Up until I met my boyfriend, I really never felt loved.

I've been seeing a therapist for over a year but it's effects have turned to almost non-existent. Every appointment is good and I get shit talked through, but my overall mental health doesn't recover at all. I've been on various set of pills too, and I've done many different treatments but nothing seems to help.

It's almost 3 AM of my local time right now and I'm lying on my bed again with one sleepless long ass night, and I would love to have company. Sorry for the jumpy and messy text.",26Sep2019,2
167,"A bit of myself, I have suffered mental illness for years. I have severe bipolar and see my psychiatrist once a month. I know the horror that goes on within someone’s head who is suffering. 
So to continue, my brother in law shows severe signs of bipolar with psychotic episodes. The episodes are so intense it almost seems as though he’s schizophrenic. My mother in law just came back from his house and he’s irritable, arguing with himself, hating his life, extremely depressed. She says that she “knows” he’s not suicidal. I on the other hand think very differently. I tried explaining to her that him speaking so badly about his life right now is a huge cry for help. He’s not going to just come right out and say he wants to end his life. I know this from experience with myself before I was diagnosed. I was absolutely suicidal, did I ever tell anyone?... no I never said those worlds. But I tried expressing to my loved ones how much I hated my life. I’m trying to help but my mother in law really isn’t letting me because she is his mother and believes she knows ultimately what’s best for him. 
She’s never gone through mental illness. I have. And I’m seriously concerned for him. Idk what to do. Advice ? :/",26Sep2019,1
168,"So all throughout high school I had friends but no real or like close friends. I didn't have a solid friend group that I hung out with, just a bunch of different people.

When I was planning for college I told myself I was going to start new. I was going to try and be more outgoing (I'm a big introvert so this was very hard, and I'll explain more later, and I have social anxiety). This was really hard for me to manage at the start, but I figured if it ends up with me having friends it will all be worth it in the end.

The first week or so was great, I hung out with my suit mates and lot and during orientation I met a few people, and we hung out. I felt really good for once in my life. Still no one I felt comfortable with enough to talk to them about my life, but I didn't expect that to happen within one month of school. Eventually those friendships fell through and I started exploring more.

I soon joined my schools news association, we have live shows that air to our town and surrounding ones Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. I started hanging out with the people in there while helping them and picking up stuff to do. Still felt really happy. I felt like I finally found my place. Still didn't have friends or anything like that. I was putting up a facade and tried to not show the real me in fear people wouldn't like me. 

The next week (I'd say this is a month into school now) on Sunday I felt really weird. I used to have frequent anxiety attacks, panic attacks, mental breakdowns, you name it I had it. And that first month of college it's like I was a new person. But this Sunday everything changed.

That feeling I felt all the sudden felt familiar. I didn't know where to go so I just started walking around for a place where I could be alone and could just deal with it myself. I found a place and I just completely broke down. Eventually I collected myself and just went back to the news room. When I got back  I felt mentally and physically different. I was back to my high school self and I didn't want to do anything all I wanted was to be left alone. Of course no one here knows what I was before so they all just assumed I was fine even though I wasn't.

I'm just so lost and confused about what to do now. I still hang out in the news room but it isn't like it was before. I don't want to take on projects even though I do...if that makes sense. I want to but it takes so much energy for me to do it and I feel like I won't do a good job and I don't want to mess up. What should I do?

I made an appointment with my counselor but is there anything else I can do? I know everyone will say just talk to people, but you don't understand how hard it is for me. I'm 18, and for the past 18 years of my life I have never opened up to anyone. I've tried, trust me, I've tried multiple therapists and tried talking to people who lent their ears, but it's like I try and speak and nothing comes out.",26Sep2019,1
