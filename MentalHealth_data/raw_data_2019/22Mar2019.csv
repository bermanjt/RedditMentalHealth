0,"Some background: I've been suffering with major depressive disorder since I hit puberty. When the anxiety that coincided the depression got to be too much (i.e- it felt like my throat was literally closing every night) I sought treatment.

I meditate, have started exercising and take 50mg of Zoloft every evening (a relativelt small dose). 

Lately the mood swings have been coming back. I sometimes think I hear people talking upstairs or whispering, but I can never understand what they say. It doesnt happen often, maybe a few times a month and usually when I'm home alone and have heightened anxiety. My doctor said this is a normal part of major depressive disorder.

This leads to my actual question: lately, when I'm watching any form of media (YouTube, movies, TV, etc), or looking through Facebook, I get this random feeling like the image or character they are about to show is going to be me or looks like me. I don't actually see myself and every time I get this feeling I go ""uh no that isn't and couldn't be you silly"". But for the first 10 seconds of the story leading upto an image or me viewing an image, I get almost this anxious tick of thinking it is going to be me or that the person looks like me. It happened once every few weeks and now has become a daily occurence. Could this just be another stress induced symptom of my major depressive disorder? I'm obviously going to talk to my doctor about it, however it seems so bizarre that I really want to if anyone knows what's going on or can relate.

   I have been in hospital for 2 weeks today and had no idea why my AC separation surgery hurt so much... Why injuries in the recent past have hurt so much. Being diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type 1 explains it. I can't comprehend it but it's why the right side of my body hurts so much from head to toe. Yesterday my body shut down on me and now I can't stop shaking, 3 weeks ago I was skiing my heart out. I was told I won't be able to do that ever again like I used to...

I apologise if this is the wrong place or wrong format in advance.   My daughter, who is about to be 7, has opposition defiant disorder. I am afraid we will get kicked out of our apartment, that she will hurt her siblings, or any other multitude of things.  We are desperate for help.  She is in therapy, on meds, goes to counceling, even been admitted to a mental hospital twice.   I am desperate.   Any advice would be to great.  Or any boot camp programs or anything at this point.   

She is perfectly behaved for everyone except her mom and I.  It's is breaking our hearts to say the least.

6,"Hey. I've kinda been thinking about posting something like this before, but I kinda thought the feelings would go away, but they haven't. They've just gotten worse.

So, no, I don't want pity or whatever. I'm just stating how I feel and why. My mom has stage 4? kidney disease and she's doing dialysis. She has been for almost two years now. That's fine. I'm glad she is. Now, my mom is manipulative and always has been. Long story short, she uses the fact that she's on dialysis to justify all the crappy stuff she says to her family, obviously myself included. She's super rude to my dad and threatens to leave us all the time. She claims she loves us, but it's really hard to even feel like she does. My dad has hearing issues and she almost always screams at him every time he can't hear her. My older sister doesn't drive even though she's well beyond the age to do so and so my mom's gotta drive her. Well, it's her choice actually. She drives her to and from work and then loses her shit about it. Every time. Calls us all lazy, losers, and tells me I suck at school every time she has the chance. There's a lot more, like how she only points out the bad in people, is racist, very unpleasant to be around, and just rotten to us. Also sexist. I'm a guy in the house, so I gotta do all the yard work and heavy stuff while the girls get to just hang out in the house. I just don't feel like getting into it.

I guess I've got anxiety or something but know I have OCD for sure. I get really anxious about a lot of things, especially regarding my girlfriend, and I ask questions sometimes, but then it turns into like, OCD blended with the anxiety and then I feel like I need to ask in certain way, at certain times, otherwise something is going to happen, and I don't know what. I'm not an abusive person, and I never will be (my ex girlfriend was very abusive towards me), and I don't want to seem abusive towards her because I ask questions about like, if she thinks anyone else is cute or something small like that. Her parents don't like me because she told them at one point that I ask questions sometimes, and now they think I'm manipulating her or something. 

I just don't have any motivation or drive to do anything. I'm swamped with homework that's all due tomorrow and I can't keep doing it. I can't focus no matter what. Everyone's acting like I'm fine and nothing's going on. My friends want to start a podcast and my girlfriend kind of just forgets about what I tell her by the next day, and my mom's not worth talking to and neither is the rest of my family because it'll just circulate back to my mom. She'll yell at me. She yells at me about everything. 

Be honest and just tell me if I'm being a little bitch and I need to grow up. I know, I sound like every young adult right now. I just need someone to tell me something. Anything, rather than just blowing it off like everyone else. I'm not happy.",22Mar2019,1

Before I start, I just want to say that I understand that this is not a replacement for an actual therapist, and that you guys cannot be sure about any answer you give me because of the extremely limited viewpoint. But I wanted to ask here because I don't know where else to ask. I'm a high school senior. I thought my constant nervousness and panic attacks and stress was just from academics, but I'm a second semester senior, I've gotten into many colleges already, and I technically have nothing to ""stress"" about right now. But yet, I just feel worse and worse. Since my freshman year, I come back from school and make a mental list of every single stupid thing I did- what I said, that decision made, that grade in bio, etc, etc, and then I mentally beat my self up over it. All I think about is how I can't do anything right, even when I know I'm overthinking things or putting too much pressure on myself. I got into uc berkeley and the day I got in, I had said something silly in class. I spent more time being angry at myself than celebrating an acceptance. And that day, I realized how silly that was. How could something silly I said to someone take precedence over my first college acceptance?

The thing is, I'm not necessarily the quietest person. I like discussions and asking questions, and conversations, and I nervous-talk a lot (I'm not necessarily talkative, just average). I thought anxiety is mostly social (when I looked it up, I saw generalized and I don't understand the difference or anything). It's more retrospective- after I talk, i go back and I think about the stupid things I said (though it's not just speaking, it's just everything I do wrong). I don't think I'm depressed - I'm not perpetually sad, I love school and enjoy that, it's just I'm always angry with myself. So I feel like if I told anyone about anxiety, they wouldn't believe me because I ""talk"" to others.

Our school has a therapist but to talk to her, you need parental permission, and while my parents would (try to) be supportive, I don't think they would understand and I would really prefer not telling my parents about this because it would just stress me out more (plus, I graduate in 2 months anyway). I wanted to tell this teacher I had last year about it but I don't want to burden her and I don't even know what ""this"" is.",22Mar2019,1
9,"I am very...high strung.  I'm one of those people who pours like 100% of myself into doing things for others with little in return and I feel like I *really* need to start taking care of myself more so I can de-stress.

The problem is all the usual methods that people like for self care don't work for me at all.

I don't like long bubble baths with candles and all that, it doesn't sooth me at all, in fact heat makes me feel sick.  I'm too hyperactive and easily distracted to meditate.  I  have past injuries that make exercise difficult.  I don't like massages.  I don't like taking drugs.  Crafts and such feel tedious to me.  Video games often frustrate me (depending on what I play).  Comfort food is hard to make work because I  have disordered eating and can't bring myself to eat ""good food"" by myself.  I don't drive and I live in a rural area so there's nowhere I can go.  I don't particularly like spending time outside.  I listen to chill music and watch cute videos often enough as it is so those have no particular special effect on me.  I am really at a loss.

I'm not trying to be difficult or shoot everything down or anything.  It's just hard to make a lot of things work.

10,"Thank you for visiting my post.

We have been in a long distance relationship and many things have not gone his way. In short, yesterday he had a major anxiety/panic attack and was uncooperative, mean, unstable, and generally difficult to talk to. He has never seen anyone for it. I'm unwilling to diagnose him from my armchair, but I do at the very least think having attacks where his body convulses and his speech hindered is worth finding some or any form of help. 

I admit that I was and am not equipped to understand and help him when he is going through something like that. I kept repeating that he needed to calm down so we could talk because I didn't understand what he wanted, and at the very end I lost my temper. Today he has not stopped repeating that I made him realize that he is a freak and completely unworthy, among other things. He seems perfectly content in this state of mind as of now and any mention of looking for help has been pushed off. 

Obviously, I cannot make him do anything he does not see value in. I'm wondering what I can say or do in order to help his difficult situation. If this is useful, we are in Canada. Thank you all very much for reading.",22Mar2019,1

**potential trigger warning, but not graphic in any way**

I'm diagnosed with severe anxiety and have been an obsessive thinker for as long as I can remember. A year or so ago, I (25M) had a fantasy about having sex with a 14 year old female while masturbating. It was the only time it has happened, I have no actual desire for her or any other underage girls, and I can 100% guarantee I wouldn't have acted on that desire if the opportunity presented itself. To this day I occasionally feel ashamed and disgusted about it, but recently more so than ever, and even admitted so to my now-girlfriend, minus the self-pleasure detail.

I still can't seem to shake my feelings of guilt about this (I think mostly because I was abused when I was young) and while it was a one time fantasy, I just feel so badly about it. My anxiety regarding it is immense because I feel sick for allowing this to happen and it's taking up a lot of headspace.

Does anyone have any advice about this? It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

tl;dr fantasized about a 14 year old and I'm obsessing over how disgusting I feel for it. It's bothering me to an unhealthy extent. I need advice.",22Mar2019,2
14,"A little background.

First panic attack in 4th grade. Told to suck it up (in not so many words) did so.

Retained various anxious traits and sought counseling in college. I managed alright most of the time, still having some classic and some odd traits to deal with - but coping.

Fast forward. I had my first child at 27, had PPD but didn’t know it until looking back. Had my second kid at 29 and she has a genetic disorder. I gave up my job and her care is complex - she is 16 months now. No family nearby and my husband can sort of care for her without me but that’s it - even nursing staff are generally unfamiliar when she is inpatient and so I wind up managing her care there too.

I feel lately as though I’m getting to a darker and darker place, and becoming less willing to do anything about it. I got a referral to a counselor last year and called but no one wants me to bring her with me and no one wants to work with me to coordinate times around my husbands schedule (which I already have to have him take off work for everything else I need like the dentist etc). 

Lately he has to go out of town and so I’m feeling more isolated and alone and the weight of the responsibility is adding to the struggles I already had. 

I’m open to advice.

And now faced with losing her a few weeks ago I stopped on the way home from work with an uncontrollable urge to go lock myself in a public bathroom and jack off.


And faced with a more real loss, the last 2 days, I spent half the wait at the airport and the uber home browsing a rabbit hole of nsfw subs and jacked off 3 times in a row and barely stopped myself from finding a dick pic sub to post too.


I need a punching bag or something. Idk if I need heavy CBT, different meds, a psych hold or what.


I told myself I was getting better. I was fine now. I spent 8 months telling her I was getting better. I told myself I had to be getting better because she needed me too.


But my god I'm not. Opening myself up to someone opened up all the problems I solved by closing myself off from everyone. In my hubris I thought I could poke a hole in the dam.


And instead of letting myself quit my job, breakdown and cry and let this all out to her when I needed to, I said I was okay and I could get better when I was actively getting worse. I wasn't lying when I kept telling her I was trying as hard as I could. But even with a therapist or doctor I can't make myself tell it all. How could I? I can barely tell 75% of it to the one person I know 100% would still love and support me. Like she said she signed up for this even when I go senile and she has to change my diapers. I can barely admit it all to myself. I get macho and tell her I don't want her to go with me because I can do it myself.  Instead of being man enough to admit I'm incapable of advocating for myself and letting her help me help myself, and not clean up my messes when I don't take care of myself. So I never made progress and made her think I don't care and trampled her feelings. Now she thinks I'm to immature and have to be taught how to be an adult. But I don't. I cognitively know what being a mature adult means but it all gets washed away in a sea of self loathing. 



Whenever she had a terrible therapist or idiot doctor that wouldn't help her, she was never afraid to cry in my arms and tell me she couldn't deal with it. Because she trusted that I would comfort her and help her. But when it was my turn, I would just tell her I could handle myself, and then didn't. And then only let enough out to try and band aid when she got pushed to the edge. I just kept telling her the tip of iceberg was totally all there was. I can handle this. I'm okay. But I'm not. Like REALLY not. And most of the problem is by the time I'm in a doctors office I look back at shit like this and down play it. Its out of my system. It passed. I'm ok now. But I'm not.


Like really, really, really not. But she was more important right. I made it this far I'm fine honey, lets get you sorted first then I can break down. We're in this as a team but just let me solo everything for a while because I can handle it. I don't need a break. I don't need to get off my high horse. I can just do everything because I'm that good. I want to be that good so I just can be. Because its better to suffer in silence and look good to the outside world than let the one person who said she would unconditionally support you and that you love be seen helping you. How dare I have picked an equal who's also capable of helping the almighty me I guess. I value strength of character  so much in her but couldn't bring myself to actually let her fight with me instead of fighting me.",22Mar2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

I'm struggling with severe mental health problems, including depression. I want to try and get some sort of health insurance so that I can go to see a psychiatrist to get properly diagnosed, pay for presumed prescriptions, and start seeing a therapist. That's all I'd be using this health insurance for, and I'd like to see the therapist ideally once a week, but once a month is fine too if that somehow fits a plan better.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know anything about insurance, and through googling all I've gotten is a bunch of sites redirecting me to other sites, and it's a never-ending cycle. I'd like to take the necessary steps to get covered as soon as possible. I applied for Medicaid but after reading that its mostly for people currently pregnant or with children, and older people, I'm pretty discouraged and not convinced I'll be accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

So, important information!

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm 24 years old
* I live in North Carolina, USA
* I'm single (not married nor do I have children)
* I live at home for the moment (3 people in the house, including myself)
* I personally make around $12k/year atm, but the household makes around $27k all together
* Depression is my only known illness
* I'm never physically sick, so I honestly wouldn't be applying this insurance very often, just for therapy and prescription coverage, mostly.
* I'm a non-smoker (a lot of websites asked me this, so it seems relevant)

Thanks for reading and any help/advice/links are super appreciated. To be honest, if someone gives me enough information to where I'm able to apply for an affordable provider that suits me, I'd be grateful enough to PayPal a little money to show my appreciation. Thanks to anyone who reads this and tries their best to help!

26,"INTRO

First off I would like to start by saying that my words are not a cry for help. I’m writing this to seek feedback and try to gain a better understanding of myself. 

BACKGROUND

I will start by saying that I do not consider myself abused. I started to notice a decline in myself around 17 yrs old. I ended up in some crazy fling with a girl that I had intense yet inexplicable feelings for and there was way too much drama at home. I lived with my mother and step father. My mother is sweet but an alcoholic and my step father was  someone I cannot describe in just a couple words. My step father seemed to care in his own way. Went out of his way for us some days and the next he’d be punching holes in walls screaming at the top of his lungs. Occasionally, we’d be throwing hands at each other. Now he is in jail for sexual assault. His 3rd offense. So much of my child hood is blank and that’s about everything I know. I ended up moving out of state to live with my biological father. That went well. Met some interesting people my last year of high school but gave up on many of my dreams. I graduated and didn’t have a clue what I wanted out of life, so I joined the Army. No real stresses there, just smooth sailing until I was honorably discharged. I got married while I was in the army and I am still married. 

MORE RECENT TIMES 

After I got out I went back to school. It went well. I held a 3.6 GPA for a couple of semesters. Then suddenly it all stopped making sense to me. I haven’t had hopes and dreams in a long time so I couldn’t understand why I even cared about getting my degree, so I withdrew. It used to be that I cared a lot about everything but now I don’t. I live like a machine. At first it started off as self hatred for unknown reasons. My escape was beating myself every day when I got home. It was cutting, to hitting myself with a hammer and everything in between. I have been hospitalized a few times due to damage that I’ve caused myself. Plenty of scars to constantly remind me of how much I used  to love it. I didn’t do it out of pity but just for the hell of it. It was entertaining. It was the best high I have ever felt. I don’t think I was trying to kill myself, yet I really didn’t care if I did die. When I had more than two days off I would beat myself to where I couldn’t breathe, occasionally sending myself unconscious. My family and friends have been out of my life since I left home at 18, so they have no input on this. I never had interest in making new friends so I didn’t. I consider new relationships exhausting and honestly a waste of my time. I don’t really know why I feel this way. 

PRESENT

For a while self harm was the only subject that interested me. I was obsessed. Now I have lost interest in that area, I can honestly say that I believe myself to be emotionless, not the kind that depression brings either. For me depression was only a numbness. I still was able to feel certain ways and even through the numbness there was this unexplainable emotional burning sensation I would get. Not anymore.

I used to enjoy music, now it’s just words with sound. 

My conversations are professional only, I have no interests to discuss. 

I still eat, sometimes. Don’t really care about the food quality though.

My sex drive is completely gone. 

I get drug tested at work and I get told that I look strung out and lifeless, but I take no drugs at all. I also don’t even day dream my only focus is getting from one task to the next. No one likes or hates me. There is nothing to like or hate. 

My weekends are dull. All I do is nothing. I just sit around and wait for Monday to roll around. 

I only have phone service Incase work needs to get ahold of me. I have no personal relationships. My wife and I are separated and to be honest when she said she was leaving I couldn’t even feel anything. I sat and tried to think about how I felt but nothing came to me.

CLOSING

Thanks for anyone who took the time to read this. In opinion, could there actually be something wrong with me? I neither engage in nor have interest in self harm anymore. I am not actively seeking to commit suicide or put myself into dangerous situations but at the same time the thought of dying has no effect on me.",22Mar2019,3
27,"So for the past few days I've had some really weird feelings. I have anxiety but it seems to have gotten quite bad in the last few days. I find myself going into..well, its hard to describe, but the closest thing to it would be disassociation. Another thing is I've been feeling really emotional, small things have been making me very angry and lash out or feel like I'm about to cry. I don't have much of a social life, either. I'm worried theres something seriously wrong with me, I have struggled with depression in the past but this feels a lot different. Any help is appreciated.",22Mar2019,2
28,"This is gonna be weird and I know you guys won’t understand but it’s worth a shot.

For some reason I feel really bad about throwing things out. Like, even a piece of candy wrapper is hard to throw out. I seriously once filled up a whole notebook/journal thing with random pieces of garbage. I also can’t sell or lose any of my things without crying about it upwards of 5 times a month at night.

I once lost a cat sweater on accident (this was 5 or more years ago) and I keep crying and can’t forget about it.

I’m probably just being a hoarder but this has been really affecting my life.",22Mar2019,2
29,"I honestly dont know where else to put this but here we go. Im on mobile so I dont know how this will be formatted sorry. 

Hi, you can refer to me as anon and today im bringing you my life story. Im a 16 year old kid in my sophmore year and things took an unexpected turn a few weeks ago for me.

A little backstory.

Two years ago in the eight grade a friend sent me an image of a girls neck that was run over by a train and usually gore didnt bother me at the time because I was young dumb and really edgy. Ive seen fucked up videos of people being killed and never batted an eye oh no but this one picture just caught me by suprise and it felt like my whole world stopped and my brain physically did a backflip in my head, then everything was numb. Like my brain, I dont know how to explain it but I remember saying at the time that it felt like 75% of me just went POOF and was replaced by some static. I remember going upstairs and crying my eyes out and then proceeding to throw up and shake myself to sleep. I remember the feeling of everything being so numb being so overwhelming I was telling myself it would go away when I wake up. Well when I woke up it was the first thing I noticed. Everything, numb. To this day it remains the same, like I said, no idea how to properly explain it but the child in me, the happy little kid, gone. And now in his place is just nothing.

That may have sounded a little ominous and it was, it was infact probably the darkest moments in my life but theres a point im trying to get to. I soon developed SEVERE anxiety and depression but refused to take medication beleiving it would make things worse for me. FFW 9 months of coping everyday after breaking down in class and almost failing my 8th grade. I can slowly admit to myself that this new me this, 25% of me thats here is ok, I got used to feeling this way. Instead of being depressed and anxious all the time I learned to live with it and to this day, I usually have no problems. 

Now, all these mental changes in my life definately changed how I behaved. I went from a care free, funny, out going kid. To a hermit who never left his house, who only had 2 friends, and so when highschool came and everyone was getting into relationships. I had a tough time. If you think im rambling, let me get to the point still. I met this girl earlier this year (my 10th grade year) and by this point my trauma and I already got used to each other. Just to clarify, I got better maybe freshman year so Ive been good for a while, just the ocasional anxiety attack. Anyway, this girl and I hit it off and basically she also had depression and anxiety which we would help each other over and to me, she was the one and ONLY first person to genuinly care about me so my heart went all in. FFW 3 months and she sucks my friends dick, I cut her out of my life instantly including my dick head friend and spiral into a deep deep hatred and depression. Since then Ive been slowly recovering but Ive recently had the chance to look at my life and sit back and wonder. I spent all of spring break in my room doing literally nothing but Discord some friends. I am shamed every day with regrets I do not wish to mention and regrets I shall carry to my grave. I look at myself and even though I know people care about me, I cant help but hate my behavior. I know I sound like a stupid cunt but I dont know how to put it into words. When I talk to people Im very confident, I can talk to a whole audience and have no stage fright. Yet, I feel as thought these people look past all that and see me for what I really am and just hate me. I dont really know where exactly Im trying to go with this but as I sit here in my room typing this out. I note two things to myself. One, all this isolation isnt good for me and Two, I need some advice on how to fix my mental state as of now. My sleep schedule is fucked bad thoughts wont let me be. 

Side story: Yesterday I saw a man being stabbed to death on Instagram on accident and ever since my trauma gore(even a little bit of inhumaneness) makes my brain feel like the day I got scarred and it just fucks me up

So, Reddit. Heres what Im asking. How can I improve my mental health, and my lifestyle, so I can live shame free and worry free and not spiral into a pit of self induced anxiety everytime something goes wrong for me?

30,"I think I'm just trying to get myself to let myself get some help here, I'm just so worried I'm blowing this out of proportion.

I've been told I have a lot of symptoms that point towards disasociation and depersonalization. For example, weird memory (I can remember something specific but practically all of last month is a blur), daydream lots, zone out staring at walls, snap rubber bands on my wrist to remind myself I'm real, find my existence wonky and have random episodes where my head feels so foggy and weird that I have to keep shaking it to wake up from the feeling.

However, I started looking at posts made by people who disassociate and have depersonalization and they describe it as things looking out of proportion and to the side, finding your mirror weird (sometimes I do but usually I'm at a mirror, checking my hair and dipping), and I can't really remember the rest. I know one person said they look at their hands and find it weird, they don't know who's moving them and they shake their legs to see if they're still there, and that hit close to home, but not much else did. I've been told everyone feels mental illness differently but how differently? I can distract myself but it's still there, but I've been told you can't distract from it. Maybe my sources are bad? Should I still try and get help, or am I maybe okay and not actually dissociating? ",22Mar2019,1
31,"I've been told that I often minimize my problems and I'm wondering if that's what I'm doing here. I know that something is wrong, and I'm about 95% sure I have health anxiety. I've been taking a few precautionary steps (daily exercise, not looking up symptoms) which seems to have minimized it but it's definitely still there. I've had 3 major panic attacks ever since it first started around 5 months ago, along with random daily episodes of anxiety &amp; fear. Right now, my anxiety is contained, but I'm worried that it may get worse. 

So when exactly is it a good idea to start looking into therapy? For people who are doing therapy, how did you know you needed it? And if therapy isn't the right option right now, are there any other options?",22Mar2019,1
32,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was thirteen.  I’m now twenty, and I just started seeing a new team of professionals at a new mental health clinic. Today, I met the RN who handles writing prescriptions and dealing with diagnoses. After talking about my past and how I’ve been dealing with things for the past few years, she looked me in the eyes and said “You have PTSD.”

I totally expected it. I’ve ticked all the symptom boxes for ages, but I always convinced myself that I was self-diagnosing or overreacting; my old therapist always disagreed and brushed me off when I brought it up, so I’ve been ignoring it (to the best of my ability, anyways) for a really long time. While I saw it coming, there’s a sense of comfort in having a medical professional essentially reassure you that you’re not making things up. 

I’m proud of myself; I kept it together really well while I was still in the office, but absolutely came apart the moment my car door closed behind me. I wasn’t even upset, and I’m still not — it’s quite the opposite. A professional actually listened to me, took time out of her day to discuss my mental health with me, talked me through her plan of action and why she chose the medicines she chose for me, and said to my face “We are going to get you better.” I believer her. I haven’t felt this optimistic in a long time. 

It feels like a light at the end of the tunnel after years of crippling depression, night terrors, paranoia, tremors, tension, and a hundred other tics and symptoms. 

I’m posting this 1) because I’m really freaking happy right now, and 2) because I want to encourage that person who feels like no one is listening, and that they’ll never get better — you will get better. You will find someone who takes you seriously, who makes time for you, who advocates for you, who reminds you of your worth, who will fight for you when you don’t think you’re worthy enough to fight for yourself, and who will grip your hand and guide you back to the surface from rock bottom. 

Keep fighting. The world is better with you in it, even on your worst days. 

Ugh. Now I’m crying again. This was really dramatic and ramble-y, but maybe it’ll encourage one person out there. ",22Mar2019,11
33,"I have been off 45mg of Mirtazapine for around a month now, I slowly weened off and have been completely free for two weeks. I physically and mentally can’t do it anymore. I am going to try Zoloft, but how do I not feel like a failure? I gave it my best shot, I was so anxious today and as soon as I thought about going back onto something it was like a weight lifted off my shoulders. I am so disappointed in myself, and I told everyone I was getting off them, how do I not feel like i’ve completely failed at it. It’s daunting to think I rely on these. I wish I never tried to get off. ",22Mar2019,1
34,"Bit of background: I'm currently in college, living in a small college town in the middle of nowhere without a car (and therefore no access to more than my school's resources). My school has a counseling center, with maybe 4 or 5 therapists.

I have had anxiety for pretty much as long as I can remember, a lot of social and also regarding food which makes eating healthy very hard for me, especially as my school requires you to be on a pretty shit meal plan. Lately I've also realized that I'm probably pretty depressed (took a couple of online quizzes which I know are far from concrete but help me to at least get an idea of how what I'm experiences compares to what's ""normal""). It's affecting my ability to wake up in time for my classes, get my work done, and feel comfortable in my friendships.

Now, I'm aware that I probably really need to see a therapist/psychiatrist of some sort, but the problem is... well, I used to, for about three years in high school. It didn't help anything, because one of the biggest effects of the social aspect of my anxiety is that it feels impossible to talk to people about the things that are actually really affecting me. I rant a lot about smaller things but the thoughts that hurt the worst and put me in the worst place mentally, I can't actually say out loud, and trying to makes my mental state worse and also sometimes can maje me feel like I'm physically almost choking. I've managed to scratch the surface with one friend, but this is a friend I would trust with my life (they let me use their room as an escape when I had a really shit roommate situation), and it was only when it was so bad I couldn't stop myself from crying when I was in their room. So even though I feel like I should try to go see a therapist again, I not only emotionally/anxiety-wise don't want to, but I have a rational basis to not go as well: I honestly believe that it just wouldn't be helpful for me. Maybe if I were able to see the same person for like, 5 years? But once I graduate I'm leaving this town so it feels like any effort I make while here will be a waste of time. 

I feel like, given the symptoms of social anxiety especially, this can't be terribly uncommon, so: have other people dealt with similar issues of doubt in the effectiveness of therapy? And if so, how have you dealt with it? Did you find other ways to cope, or did you find a way to make therapy work?

Going to say in advance that I appreciate any advice anyone has, since tomorrow I may not have the mental/emotional energy to actually respond to any comments, but that doesn't mean I'm not reading them! ",22Mar2019,1
35,"The range of emotions I feel in a day is absurd. I go from adrenaline-fueled joy to sky high anxiety to feeling completely hopeless to feeling fine again. You wouldn't know it if you knew me. Outwardly I stay pretty regulated. But my brain is a rollercoaster of anxiety/panic and sadness and anger and happiness and excitement. 

I don't ever have a good day or a bad day. Every day is both great and awful. I'm productive and motivated and feeling good about myself and then I'm sobbing in the shower and wanting to quit my job. 

I've been this way for as long as I can remember but I used to find it exciting in a weird way. I liked the extremes. But lately it's just exhausting. I just want some stability.

I've been in therapy. It helped with processing various things and gave me coping skills but it doesn't stabilize the underlying emotional rollercoaster. 

Some people around me think I may have ADHD. I'd never considered it because I've always done very well academically. But is it possible that's what this is?",22Mar2019,4

37,"First id like to say sorry for any grammatical errors or anything like that, it’s late and I’m kinda upset. Anyways, I’m a 16 year old male, I don’t really know where to begin so I guess I’ll just start from the beginning. I’m never happy like I used to be, I haven’t had a giddy happy feeling in so long I honestly don’t remember the last time I did, even on Christmas, my birthday, I just haven’t felt like that. I have times where I feel happy obviously, and I can forget about stuff and focus decently well on having fun while I’m with my girlfriend and my other friends but the moment they leave, I instantly start my endless cycle of worry and self loathing. I drown my thoughts out with music a lot, it helps me most of the time but sometimes it makes it worse too, it depends. I can never focus on anything anymore, I can’t keep up on my normal amount of homework for a standard student and it’s not because I don’t have the time, I just can’t focus and frankly, I’ve lost my care for it. I’ll sit there and stare blankly at whatever I’m doing, and soon enough I’ll just give up completely, knowing my parents will be disappointed in me and I’ll not get as good of a grade but I can’t help myself from just not caring, I know I should but I can’t. Very frequently throughout the day I’ll get really heavy dissociation and stare off without realizing it for minutes at a time and sometimes need someone to shout at me or touch me for me to come out of it, I go on walks a lot when I cry/when I’m upset or anxious and I’ll walk across a street sometimes without realizing it until after the fact or if a car honks at me. As I walk through the hallway I always feel like everyone is looking at me, I’m very overly self aware of how I look and act in public and I stress about it a lot if I sit anywhere near the front of the classroom. I have good friends that are supportive and kind and I love them to death but I never feel like I can truly open up to them, even when they’re trying to get me to tell them what’s wrong I can never bring myself to be able to do it because I’m worried I’ll drive them away. I feel constantly tired, and I mean constantly. I sleep at school, on weekends I’ll sleep 13-14 hours and still be taking naps throughout the day, even if I try to keep my sleep schedule consistent I still always, always feel exhausted and like I could fall asleep literally anywhere. I get anxious over literally everything, if someone doesn’t reply to a text within 5 minutes I start to worry if I’ve done something wrong, at school sometimes I’ll start to worry about stuff and I can’t sit still and I start to sweat and shake and do compulsions, I can’t help but think existentially about everything and contemplate self harm and suicide but I’m simultaneously too afraid and anxious to act on it, I know deep down that there’s people that care about me and some that might even love me but I can’t help but think that I’m a bother to everyone and that nobody actually cares about me. I cry for no reason on a consistent basis, every time I eat I consider purging because I’m insecure about my weight even though I’m not overweight, sometimes I’ll take over the counter medication when I don’t need to just because I have an impulse to do it, I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to talk to my parents about getting help and they excused it as “Part of being a teenager” and the thought of going to a therapist or a psychiatrist really scares me and makes me anxious. I can never decide if I actually need help or not because my parents have told me it’s just a phase or that it’s just temporary and I’ll get better or whatever but honestly, I really don’t know. I just don’t feel like myself and don’t think I’ve truly been as happy as I used to be since I was 12 or 13. Logically I should be happy with everything and everyone I have in my life but I’m just not. I feel like an emotional mess all the time, and I don’t know what to do. I’m sorry, I know this is a lot and I appreciate you reading it. I just need some advice from someone without having to see someone in person and without it being with or around anyone I know. Is it really just something that’ll go away or do I need some help, my friends and my girlfriend all have gotten the help they need and gotten medications and they’re worried about me, I’m worried about me too, my parents aren’t worried about me and consider me to be a happy person but I’m really good at hiding emotions and they don’t really know who I am anymore. I just need some advice. I know this is kind of just a jumbled mess of emotional baggage but I didn’t know what else to say and I hate to turn to reddit for this but I don’t know who to talk to. What’s wrong with me? What do I need to do? ",22Mar2019,3
38,"I sort of stopped dating for awhile because I couldn’t deal with it during university due to my anxiety and depressive episodes. Last semester (I’m taking my final class now) I decided to start putting myself out there again. I felt my mental health had finally become stable, and was reasonably happy with myself as a person.

For the most part it hasn’t gone well except for some meaningless hookups. (No sour feelings in either side)

Today I went to the game store to get Sekiro as I had pre ordered it. I’m the second person in line waiting for it. It’s 8:30, the game is released at 9:00.

There is this pretty young lady in front of me in line. I gave her a generous amount of personal space. Eventually she strokes of a conversation with me (I had just been tinkering around on reddit). 

We talk for awhile about various things. College, a few personal details, video games, and so on. Eventually I realize we’re flirting. I look at the time it’s 8:59. The clerk calls her up, shoot I’ve lost my chance. She’ll be gone before I work up the courage to ask for her number.

He quickly hands her the items, I somewhat hurriedly get mine. I look over, she’s standing there, presumably waiting on me. I look at her and say “would it be weird if I asked for your number?” 

She gave me a business card, we texted later while I played the new game. I think I’m going to ask her on a date tomorrow. I’m not sure why I felt this was such a big deal, but I’m proud of myself. Sorry if this isn’t the type of post that goes here, I wanted to share it with someone as I don’t like talking to my friends about my mental health.",22Mar2019,1
39,"I'm not one to publicly share my problems on the internet, especially on here. But it's extremely late and I figured that it would help me relieve some of this tension I have in my head. Recently, I've been feeling like my life is extremely unfair. I don't know whether or not my life has suddenly took an unlucky turn these past few years. I started off high school and was able to branch out and make new friends. I didn't have the easiest time, but thinking back now I'd say I had a much better and easier past. Now that I'm a senior, things have changed so much. My closest friends have left me for genuinely no reason (one of my best friends stopped talking to me after getting a date and never bothered to speak to me again). My life just doesn't live up to my expectations. My most deepest desires and goals are rejected no matter how much effort I put into achieving them. The attention and affection that I strive to earn from others is given to people who don't think twice about it. People are out here getting praised and glorified for the smallest of things and I can never seem to get an ounce of that. I feel like I'm always putting in the extra effort to get what I want, and that's not out of my choice. It feels like I HAVE to put in more effort, no matter what I do - things just always seem so much harder for me than for others. Now, I'd say I'm a pretty determined person and I work so hard for what I want. I strive to improve myself and improve my strengths and skills in what I can do. But sometimes it just genuinely gets so exhausting to put all of that energy into these small little things.

It's hard for me to phrase this in a way that makes me feel like the only person I feel bad for is myself. I am grateful for so many things in my life. I'm even grateful to be able to share my thoughts at this moment on this platform where people seem to genuinely care about each other. That type of energy is something that I value so heavily and it's been terrifying me at the lack of times I've had that in my life. Each day has a struggle for me, but I am thankful to have the people in my life who encourage me to overcome them. At the same time, I can't help but think that these small superficial desires that I'm able to have will never live up to the loss I face when it comes to my bigger and more important desires. Buying a new shirt is easy for me. But that temporary joy I get from that just doesn't live up to the joy I want to get after an audition for a role I've always wanted or becoming successful in general.

And all that disappointment channels my anger when I'm frustrated and I can't help but look at my life and look at the world with a bitter eye. I've been looking at everything with such a bad eye - judging people, criticizing people, etc. I can't help but feel that way, because it just seems like everyone's having such a better time with their lives than I am. I even got called out on it and I hate admitting my flaws, but its completely true. I've been turning into a pessimistic debbie downer. Everyday there's a problem that I have to go through. I'll bump into someone who bullied me or someone will say something rude to me or I'll ruin my good shoes by stepping on gum. Small things like that have been throwing me off so much more lately and I just don't know what I'm doing wrong and I can't find a way out of this. I've been feeling so depressed and been finding so much less value in my life now.",22Mar2019,1

I don't know how these feelings started but somehow I fully convinced myself that I as a human being do not deserve happiness or anything good at all in my life, which really hurts my relationship of three years. My boyfriend is the sweetest man I have ever met and I am totally in love with him, which leads my brain to tell me I don't deserve him. I am neither going to school nor working right now, and haven't been since July, which leads to me being fully convinced I am a true burden on everyone in my life. Hell I feel like a burden just typing this down because I know someone will read this and I don't want to waste their time.
I am adrift at sea and have no navigational tools. My dear boyfriend wants to help so bad and I have no idea how he can, which leads to him worrying which leads to me feeling like even more of a burden.
I am so overwhelmed with feelings of isolation and despair that I don't leave my house for weeks at a time. I spend an hour at most outside of my room just for eating. 
I feel like my few friends are only friends with me out of pity and it doesn't help that they have a tendency to flake on our plans while actively making more that don't include me.
I don't have any direction in my life whatsoever and I feel I'm not good at anything, especially the things I love doing.

45,"I know I've done this before, and I'm sure that if I put in the effort, I can do it again. Right now, I guess I'm thinking it'd be helpful to just put the thoughts out there because there's a part of me that's telling me these thoughts aren't necessarily accurate.

I'm 30 years old, turning 31 in a few months. I'm currently living with my parents, who are in the process of finding a retirement home. I'm under pressure to find a stable means of employment, both from my parents, my family, and myself. I graduated from college nine years ago, did work in my industry for a good six years, and then it kind of fell apart. I was laid off, I lost my benefits, my therapist discontinued treatment, I was subsequently hospitalized, and then proceeded into a downward spiral.

I worked about two temporary jobs until I was jobless again and realized that I had to move in with my parents. During this time, I struggled with focus and motivation. I hadn't been able to get back into my industry and probably won't at this point. While my skills are indeed ""adequate,"" the 'level' of industry standards has long passed me by. Since then, I've worked five other jobs and am currently on my sixth. As it so happens, I'm on my sixth month with this contract job; which means this is the do-or-die period. Either they can choose to bring me on or send me packing.

I've worked my butt off at this current place, but even then still had issues with my mental stability. True, I've been able to get back onto healthcare and find another therapist, but the lack of certainty has made it really difficult for me to feel comfortable.

I look at my friends who, while they indeed have their hardships, are finding a way to make it work. I look at my girlfriend, who consistently tells me she's grateful to have me. And yet, I cannot find it within myself to feel what she feels.

I know that self-worth shouldn't be defined by one's profession. But the fact that not having a stable source of income or employment makes this whole process a lot harder. On top of that, I'm currently awaiting lab results from an ultrasound to determine what's wrong with my live. Needless to say, it's been a tough week.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a line from a movie that once said ""Hell is waking up every g\*\*damn day and not knowing why you're here."" In therapy, I was once told that while we may indeed be insignificant to someone halfway across the world, the importance lies in the ripples of connections and actions we do in our daily lives. I don't deny this, but I also know that if I were to leave this world behind, the world will inevitably continue turning.

I guess most of my negative feelings are stemming from the idea that I've failed at Life. I haven't had financial stability for the past three years. I'm trying to figure out my Life but have no idea what to do. People in my Life tell me I'm worth something, but I don't feel that way at all. In fact, how the fuck did I land such a wonderful girlfriend?

This is a predicament, because I have no intention of hurting anyone and I know doing myself in would be just that. So now, I feel like I'm just stuck in a moment and I can't get out of it. I've been praying in a manner of speaking, trying to embrace this idea of ""submit"" and ""surrender."" These are in a religious context, by the way. I'm not religious, but I do have faith in God, if that makes any sense.

I should just stop talking now. I dunno, it's just annoying to ""know"" something but ""feel"" completely different about it.

48,"It's a pervasive deeply ingrained worthless feeling.  I'm angry and that rage has nowhere to go.  I'm going to be completely honest in this post, or at least try to be.  I think my whole life or a large part of it was based on looking down at other people, and using that leverage as a crutch to make myself feel better about myself.  I don't think it's been consciously in my head, or how far back it goes.  All I know is I feel like I have no worth as a person.  I have interests. I can do things. I have hobbies.  Those things seem superficial and fickle to me, to the point where I think they're meaningless.  I don't think the problem is whether or not I'm interesting or boring, or severely lacking in these things.  I think the problem is I feel fundamentally worthless as  person so I adopted this idea of morality that was based on looking down on others and seeing myself as either a victim or morally superior. It's a really shitty world view that isolates you and alienates you from other people and ruins any chance at free unrestrained love.  It's always lurking in the background isolating me from other people.

Also, there's a guy I love and I feel like we're drifting and it upsets me. I'm not sure if that ties into this.  There are few people in my life who I felt this way about.  I had a really good friend who I'll never see again.  It sucks, finding new people and tolerating superficial relationships you don't want.  I know lots of people. I wouldn't call them good friends.  I consider him a good friend, and I love him.  He's interesting, and I love his voice.  It's almost like I know how he thinks.  I find it insulting when people I hardly know engage me in conversation, or touch me, or whatever...because I'm not that cheap.  I really love this guy.

49,"So I made this Reddit account just to vent. I don't expect anyone to help me here, and I don't expect anyone to care. But I need to let this out, because I genuinely can't take it anymore, and I don't know what else to do. Also, I'm really sorry this is a long read, but these are things that have been burning in my head for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna try to leave out as many pieces of personal information as possible. But I promise that whatever I do include here is 100% true.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 31 years old, and I'm Syrian. I live in a South-east Asian country with my wife, who's a citizen of the country I live in. I used to work in Dubai before I was fired due to my mental illnesses. I worked at that company 7 years before I was fired. When I was 16, I started feeling depression, but I lived in an area where mental illness weren't taken seriously. Even I didn't really know much about it, even though I felt it. I just thought that I was sad for no reason, and never understood why. By the time I was 22, I moved to Dubai to work at a company, but due to their awful treatment of employees, such as forcing us to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, without any extra pay, and due to my situation whilst living there (being away from my family, having no one to trust or talk to, having no friends or family with me, until I met my wife 5 years after coming to Dubai), my depression became worse and worse. My salary was not enough to allow me to afford medication or professional help, so it only got worse and worse. I told my manager that, and told him I was starting to worry (I didn't tell him that I was becoming suicidal, but I was at the time), so he said he'll talk to his hire-ups and see if they can help me with insurance. 25 days later, I was called to the head office to be told that I'm being let go. Although they wouldn't get into the details, the exit-interview clearly hinted at them worrying of my ""Mental instability"". Like I'm some kind of nutcase.

&amp;#x200B;

Without a job, I would be forced to return to Syria. Imagine that, even though I was born in the UAE, and I lived the majority of my life in the UAE (just to be clear, that's United Arab Emirates, the country Dubai is in), that doesn't mean anything to them. If I don't have a job, I can't have a work visa. I'm not allowed any other visa, and I couldn't find another job. So I was given a short time to either find another solution, or go back to Syria. And I really didn't wanna go back to Syria. As much as I would love to see my family again, I wouldn't be allowed to because as soon as I enter, I'd be drafted to join the army against my will. I don't want to join the army, and fight a cause I have nothing to do with. If I wanna go back without being drafted, I'd have to spend like $8000, and there's no way I'd be able to have that amount of money.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, my wife (who happened to be my fiance at the time, I met her 2 years before I was let go), suggested that we should move to her country and start a new life there. We came here, got married, and started living here in her country. She quit her job in Dubai, and got a new job here. I, unfortunately, couldn't get a job for many reasons, both visa related ones, and mental health related ones. I was able to start my own career, however, as a video game critic, and video game designer (mostly writer). I started a YouTube channel to make video game analytical reviews, and I started working on my first game with a friend of mine in Europe (we met on Facebook, and became best friends). I don't earn much from my work, but I have 6 wonderful people who support me on Patreon. Things were supposed to get better. They didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know where to start. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and paranoia. For the first few months, living here, we were able to afford medication, but then it became too much to handle buying any more. My wife is an angel, and she does her best to support me both mentally and financially, but that too is making me hate myself even more. I try to convince myself that I'm running a good video game critique channel, and that I do all the chores around the house while she's at work, but no matter how hard I try to convince myself that she needs me, I can't stop feeling that I'm just a burden on her. And with all of this on my head, I just can't focus on work anymore. Whilst I was on medication, I was able to make 1 video per week or every 2 weeks. Now, I go 3 to 4 weeks without making anything. I just can't focus on my job anymore. It even got worse when I realized I can't even bring myself to enjoy a video game just to relax. Nothing relaxes me anymore. Whatever I do, I keep thinking of how much of a fuck-up I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what I feel. Am I feeling bad because my channel is very small, and has less than 200 subs? Of course I feel bad about that, especially after all the work I put into my content, and every time I try to share my work, I get crucified because I \*Gasp\* am committing the cardinal sin of ""SELF-PROMOTION"". But is that really why I'm down? Or is it because I feel guilty that I am but a burden on my wife? Is it because I miss my family so much? Is it the fact that our house is only half built? I mean that alone is doing my head in. We have no ceiling, no bed, no kitchen, I get bites all day, all night, we live in a very rural area where internet is crap, and the power is even crappier. The fan is moving so slowly due to low electricity, I swear I could count the spins if I focus hard enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I barely go out, I have no friends here, all my friends are online, and they're always busy (not to mention time-zone differences), I have no one to play with, no means to play with them anyway, and I'm just so tired. That's not even mentioning how devastating it is for me to live in such a small town where everyone thinks it's okay to just come visit at any time. As an introvert, this is literal hell to me. Us not having much money is also not making things better, but at least we're not starving, I guess. Imagine being kicked out of the country you were born in. This should not be okay. It just shouldn't. Not to mention the fact that even though I'm married, this country's law does not allow me permanent residence or a citizenship, since I'm Syrian. I could live here for 50 years, and I'd still be renewing a temporary visa every 2 years, which costs so much money, it's more than a full month's pay.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do anymore. I really don't. Everything seems so devastatingly bad, and I can't handle it anymore. I don't really see any other choice but to just end it all. What's the point of living if you don't even feel alive? I would do anything to move to Europe, to live in the same country as my best friend. I would do anything to live in a place where humans are treated like humans. I've lived in shitty situations all my life, I can't even begin to imagine what it's like to live in a place like Sweden or Norway. I'd work full time with my friend, who's a brilliant programmer. We could make games, play games together, he could help me with my reviews. My wife and I would finally feel alive. I think I'm rambling at this point. I'm sorry. I just really needed this out.",22Mar2019,2
50,"I'm struggling with anxiety/depression and have so for a few years. Sometimes it's ok and other times it's a nightmare. I always feel like a burden when ever I attempt to reach out to a friend. I'll second guess any  time I want to say I'm not ok. I don't really know why I feel the way I do because I haven't really had anything to cause me to feel like this in a long time, but I think the effect it had on me has stuck and I can't get rid of it. 

Not really sure what I want to say here. I just needed to get it out somewhere. ",22Mar2019,2
51,"first of all, english isn't my native language, so sorry if there are grammatical errors""I'm brazilian, 17, male"". Well, my story starts in the fifth grade, I changed of school and didn't have anyone do talk for six months, i don't talked to anyone for fuck SIX months. So, I gained a ""friend"", who stopped  stop talking to me after some time. At the same time, some people""many"" have bullied against me"" mainly verbally "", so i was alone for a year, well, I changed of school because my grades aren't so greats and i lose the school assistence. 

 In sixth grade  until the eighth grade, I encounter two-three people who are were ignored by everyone as well, but, they are good people. Still, I thought I was inferior to the others, I thought that nothing I did was good enough, that I was dumber than the others ""despite taking rankings like 9.0 or 10.0"", it was always sad and it was playing videogames all the day or lost in my world of imagination, was always one of two, I wanted to be accepted by others, but I did not succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, was the same, but I was BROKEN, I never liked to demonstrate feelings""for example, when  I was myopic, I hid this from my family for three years, and my myopia was grade 3 at the time, i was fifth grade"", so, I kept everything inside myself and I felt empty. But, socially speaking, I improved my communication, always pretending to be a cheerful and communicative person.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm in college, i never felt so weak, i was thinking to suicide sometimes, i was thinking how the people would react to my death, things like this. Well, anyways, right now i'm thinking to make an appointment with a university psychologists, so, what do u think i have do to? i want advices.

52,"I just spent an hour or two doing this on mobile, accidentally closed the app and now i must restart on pc :) hopefully ill make it better this go.

So i spent an hour or 2 last night just talking to my self cuz i feels better when i talk about everything in the open and i thought i would be better if it was to someone so this is what im going to do, im going to lay my life out in a post so i can start feeling better and maybe gets some help on what to do in my life.

Just a heads up i dont think my writing and speech is very good and i sometimes tend to get off topic.

Oh and some info on me: male, 18, canadian

So with all that out of the way lets start from the beginning...


Age 4: one day i just woke up on my earliest memory, i was a pretty normal kid, did normal things like poop behind the couch cuz i didnt like using underwear apparently and droping a big shell om my sisters head(she was fine i think)

5: i think i was exited for kindergarten, meeting new people and learning new things. one girl that i wanted to become friends with left early into the year so at home i jumped on my parents bed singing a song about it but i think my dad heard it but i just got defensive about it saying i wasnt.

6: Grade 1 this is where i found my bestest friend, lets call her violet, we really worked together. There were also all the people who carried over from kindergarten and one friend who left at the end of the year to go to a different school.

7: Grade 2 as the years went on i got more in to artsy stuff like drawing small comics, little interactive treasure maps, random things out of paper. A cool thing me and Violet would do is make a comic but switch off every panel and just see where it would go, i still remember one where a guy is shot to mars where santa is who is controlling a bunch of zombies.

8... :School wise, everything was fine. Home wise on the other hand, I fucked up. We had a computer that i would play flash games and watch youtube on, but as most people would know youtube in the early years had some porn and sexual content. I eventually found that stuff and knowing i shouldn't have been looking at that stuff i liked it for some reason. After doing that on three different occasions i got caught because of the search history.

My dad is a very loud man, if you do something he doesnt like he will yell at you. When he found it he yelled extremely loud this time, after that i ran to may room, hopped in my laundry basket, and put cloths over me and just sat there.

Im pretty sure that this moment cemented the feeling that i never want to make someone mad at me or do anything wrong. Also when ever i look up something to pip pip the diddly doo i must make sure ive left no evidence no matter what or else i freak out and worry.

I cant remember if this next thing was a dream or not but im pretty sure my dad talked about this at a dinner out with other family members 

9: Grade 4 one day when climbing a tree in my backyard (which was a pretty decent size) i realized that the neighbors that lived at the bottom of the cliff behind my house was the one friend that left to go to another school in grade 1 and he also happened to have a trampoline so i hung out there every few days, sometimes we would put soap on it, those were fun times.

This was also the year that my parents split up but before the split was the fighting and breaking things. one thing broken was a dragon head incense holder and the balcony glass door was cracked. then on day my dad left and put notes on me and my sisters pillows, i dont remember what the letter said, dont know where it went, and i dont care. I didnt even cry really, there was a little bit but just cuz i didnt understand what was happening.

My dad moved back in with his parents and eventually we would go over and stay a couple of nights there.
(i remember putting something else here last time but cant remember it)

10: Grade 5 was a ok time, did some lunch monitoring which i found fun, friend situation increasing. **Oh one thing that ticked me off is cuz i was in a 5-4 split class i didnt get to learn the ukalaylee and instead had to do the recorder AGAIN**. ok back on topic. For my birthday this year i went to an amusement park with my dad and rode one of those things that goes really high up and drops you.

11: Grade 6 the next few years are starting to get a bit jumbled in my head. before middle school started we had to move for some reason, we got put in lowincome housing in a decent area away from the highway and the new house was fine... at first, ill talk more about that in the second move.

In school half of my friends went to a differnet school but all that mattered was that violet was still with me. With going to a new school come making new friends who turned in to close friends and sadly some of them disappeared when moving on to highschool. One of these ""friends"" was someone, lets call them diddy, started hanging with me, violet and some other friends that would come and go, i wasnt very fond of diddy, the main thing that comes to mind when thinking of him was his sausage fingers.     

My dad at this point move a little further out with a friend of his into a decent sized house but later moved.

12: Grade 7 was ok, i tried to join band class and learn the trumpet but realized that i get lightheaded from it too easily so i quit it, luckily for me everyone not in band, which in my class was like 8 people, got to just mess around and do things like paper airplane contests plus violet didnt join band. Around this time me and violet ~~and diddy~~ would play a choose your oun adventure time thing where violet would make a the story and id play them, they would just be very simple, have no story, and be **VERY MEMEY**. Diddy was starting to become a more permanent part of our group and thus making the group tend to get bigger.

I dont remeber if this happened in grade 7 or 8 but i said something silly like me being creeped out at the possibility that slender man was real cuz of those old drawings that make it seem real and might have made it seem that i thought it was real and diddy said some stuff, i said some stuff and wandered off, From that point i hung out less in that group cuz i couldnt stand diddy and thus less with violet and also becuase we wernt in the same class after grade 6.

(Its getting harder to put everything in chronological order)

13: Grade 8 is i think when i started hating school more and more, i eventually tried to hang with violet more at school.

My dad and mom were seeing other people, my dad *WAY* more than my mom. Mom with one guy that lasted a year or 2, Dad with plenty of woman ( one i walked in on them having sex(wasnt noticed THANK GOD)) most of them were nice, only 2 or 3 bad ones.

14: Grade 9 started high school. saw violet once in the halls and never agian after that...   had no way of contacting her since i got my first phone later in the year. Bad year...

15: Grade 10 Joined band because a friend told me i should. I never should have listened to him...
worst year of my life, at this point in my life my social anxiety had started to rise and a little bit later my depression. In band i did percussion... i wasnt good, was too scared of messing up, the only thing i did performance wise was holing the banner for the marching band, worst night of my life... . My socials teacher was nice but her teaching style was killing me.

16: Grade 11 with my luck i got the same socials teacher again, near the end my wrist was killing me from writing so much that i thought pulling the old rope while writing would take my mind off the pain, it didnt enough so i just droped the class to do it again with a different teacher next year. In one of the classes i had with diddy i asked him it he had any idea what happened to violet to no avail, so being me i did quite a bit a searching the internet for her and found nothing but dead facebook pages from 2013 so i droped the case for now... At this point i was interested (i think) in a girl in my chemistry and physics class but that went nowhere.

One day my dad talked to me and my sister and asked us about how we would feel if he had another kid, my sister didnt care and i preferred if he didnt but thinking back on it his girlfriend was probably already pregnant(plus she already has a 4 year old whos a brat and still is)

My mom at this point started see her second person after the divorce and i think they're fine together and theres no chance of them having a kid(mom tied the tubes after me a 10 pound bab)
but he dose have one too but hes a decent 5 year old

17: Grade 12 At this point my friend group had shrunk severely, i was down to about 6 people(only 1 i talk to now) but my classes were fine, english class i bearly passed with a 53 or something like that but i wasnt worried. I was a little low on credits so i became an art class TA, it was great, all i had to do was help move stuff, mix glue and water, hang stuff up... i loved it. I was so curious of what happened to violet so i started the search again this time deeper, it eventually payed of kinda...  i found her sister on twitter but havent messaged her... i dont know what id say or what id do once i could talk to violet, so im just sitting on that for now.

I didnt want to go to my graduation ceremony, i hated most of the people and hated big crowds and being the center of attention and hated unknown situations. i eventually went through with it because my mom wanted me to and i got a grad cap and little book out of it.
Oh and just my like i had gotten there a little late so i missed the group photo, which is weird since i had almost always missed that day the class group photos happened.


A little thing: 
At one piont in middle school i was so lonely that i tried to make a voice in my head to talk to and it probably would have worked if i kept up.

Heres what i wanted to be: 
Chef -&gt; Scientist -&gt; Make a game -&gt; Something with computers -&gt; Grocery store


So now we're caught up, its 2019, ill be 19 soon and still dont have job, just got moved out of my 2nd house due to mold and plumbing problems so im back near where i used to live near a highway.
I only have 1 friend from school left, the (not so much anymore) pathological liar who got kicked out of the friend group by everyone else, i have two other school ""friends"" on steam but they havnt bothered contacting me and neither have i tried with them.

It just feels good to have this typed out and probably better once its out
Im not gonna read through it again, i dont care if something is spelled wrong, its good enough for me
im sorry if this is stupid, i get real chatty when im tired.

i dont know what to write now... i guess ill talk how i feel now

i wish i could get over my social anxiety
i wish i didnt feel like death when looking someone in the eyes
i wish i had a female friend i could talk to about anything   (SAYING THIS FEELS REAL WEIRD)
i wish i was able to live on my own and didnt have to rely so much on other people
i wish i could find something that will make me more happy

Anything that could help me would be great
ok im gonna post this before i change my mind, its 2am i need sleep ill check in the morning.

57,"I don’t know what to do. My [24f] mum [50f] has been struggling schizophrenia for the last 13 years. She was the best woman I could ever have known, the perfect mum. Dazzling and beautiful, with a naive outlook. She race me and my friends up climbing frames, get caked in mud with us. She was such a kid ha. Fed us extremely well - she's 5""6 my dad 5""10 and my brother has grown to be 6""4 and I 5""11. So kind hearted, always wanting to help people. She dedicated half her time to charity. She gave so much of herself but had previously been in a physically and mentally abusive marriage with my dad and was hurt so much by the people closest to her which unfortunately led to a breakdown that has destroyed her life. After losing her home and two businesses all in a space of months, something changed. 

She started believing no one could be trusted and everyone was out to hurt her. She believed it was a whole conspiracy all the way up to the government and she was a main target because of her qualities. She believed she was fighting spiritually for the human race and there were some people who 'didn’t like that'. She started taping letter boxes down, carrying around a suitcase with all the food and pans every time she left the house which then led to having to take all our clothes and EVERYTHING we owned around, to the shop, even if we were just getting milk. She thought people where coming in and 'tampering' with our things. She thought we were being drugged as part of an experiment. Neighbours who had known her for years didn’t recognise her. A few arguments happened with neighbours that caused her to be sectioned. My brother and I were put in care but that's another story.

Her several hospital experiences were the most traumatic experiences of our lives. She refused to take medication so it was forced onto her by injection. To be held down by several nurses, being forced an injection, is truly something i could only imagine in my nightmares. I can't imagine what she was feeling, especially when she truly believed they were injecting her with poison. The side effects she experienced were worse. When i went to visit her, she was in bed, with a swollen face and she just couldn’t move or talk. Her lips were so swollen and stiff, she couldn’t form words. She didn’t recognise who were. My brother and I tried telling the doctors that this wasn’t the right treatment, it was inhumane, but I was only 11, my brother was 10. Our voices weren't listened to and we had no other family to ask for help and the treatment continued.

After a few weeks of being sedated (zombified), she was able to start walking around so they would release her. She was not my mum. My chatterboxy, passionate mum had become emotionless, no laughter, no talking.  She walked extremely slowly, with her hands stiff slightly in front of her. (She couldn’t move her arms due to stiffness). She complained of weakness and achy bones, and feeling suicidal. She once said  I don’t know, but every time i have a knife in my hand, i just want to hurt myself with it' and 'every time I’m walking on a bridge, i just want to throw myself off it'. Nurses were coming round daily to give her the medication. My mum started to stop taking it by hiding the pill under her tongue and spitting it out until she just out right started refusing to take them. The physical side affects of the drug only started to ceed a year after she stopped taking it (puts to light how strong those were).

Anyway, after each sectioning, as time progressed the paranoia would start kicking in again which would lead to her being sectioned again and treated the same way as last time with the same drugs and stuff. An endless cycle.  She'd come out again, act a bit normal but then she start getting paranoid. It'll start with tissue paper in the cracks on the walls, then taping the windows, then the letter box, then huge furniture against the doors so no one can come in. Will start calling people 'sick' saying her past hospitalisation was all part of the big 'plan'. The 'conspiracy' was the only thing she could talk about. If i was talking about achievements in school, she'll respond with 'none of that matters, we're still slaves, you'll understand when you’re older what games are at play'. She hated all my friends because she thought they were  'all in on it.' If I went to a sleepover I had to promise I wouldn’t sleep because she told me my friends will inject me. The lowest point was one evening when she was scared because of helicopters in the sky, she brought our mattresses to the living room, brought ALL the furniture down to barricade us in the living room, with all the lights off because she thought they were coming to get us. Being children, we couldn’t help but slightly believe it. It was terrifying. She'd then be sectioned.

 This cycle happened throughout our teenage years, she must’ve been in and out of hospital 9 times. Every time she wouldn’t eat the food there as she believed it was poisoned so my brother and myself would do daily shops and drop it off to make sure she would eat. We couldn’t just drop off a weeks worth or two days worth because they would have to put it in the kitchen (no food allowed in the bedrooms) and she believed the food will be 'tampered with' if left in the kitchen. Once she was taken as far as London, about a two hour drive away from where me and my brother lived, she lost so much weight because we weren’t able to drop off food daily. Finally I turned 18 and as her nearest relative, had the power to request her discharge every time she’s been discharged. Which i have always done instantly as I didn’t wanted her going through another traumatic time again. 

A lot has happened in the last few years since her last sectioning, down to her becoming homeless. She’s moved countless times, due to not getting on with neighbours.  She was homeless for four months and spent a lot of that time sharing a room with me. We had to keep it a bit of a secret because my landlord wasn’t happy with it and he lived there. I became and anxious wreck during this time which affected my ability to support her. It led to a complete breakdown and having to be signed off work for two weeks, which didn’t help because the situation was in my bedroom. It was difficult having to listen to her rants every night. She now has very strong views that are not in line with my values. She would be rocking back and forth mumbling out loud all night. She said she was 'working hard'.

 Anyway we managed to sort out supported housing for her after a few months of trying to get help from the council. She's been moved 3 times this year due to antisocial behaviour. She can't leave the house unless i come over and house sit. She barricades herself in. She wont let me help with housework cause im her daughter, we've fought so much about that but she’s not able to keep up with the cleaning, wont let me help, and i can only just manage to go there once a week. All food (even tea, sugar, milk, eggs) she keeps in bags in her room because she thinks people come in whilst she’s asleep. Its a nightmare watching her trying to make a cup of tea - takes about 20 minutes trying to find everything. She's in a state where she has become abusive (never physically) to almost everyone. Shouting about how they're attacking her spiritually, 'theyre all sick', blah blah. They are proper rants and you just cant stop her. And ill be honest, i cant listen to it without having a panic attack majority of the time or just getting angry with her telling her to stop saying abusive things cause the things she’s say is against everything stand for, against everything SHE taught me to stand for morally ( which i instantly feel guilty about because i know IT'S NOT HER)

She is now back in hospital after being verbally abusive to the hostel staff and they raised concerns about the things she was saying. Doctors have told me they need to medicate. My mum is already saying she cant wait to leave in 72 hrs, because she knows its something that usually happens cause i always get her out. The thing is, seeing how her life is going downhill and seeing the quality of life she is living, its really dawned on me that she is not well this time round. I’ve spent my whole teenage and adult years defending her, saying she’s just traumatised, she’s not unwell (because that's all shed ever tell me and if i said otherwise she would start saying im on 'their side'.) I was worried if she loses the trust she has with me and my brother, she would have NO ONE cause she trusts no one else. I think i spent it all in denial. I never really said out loud she was 'unwell' just 'traumatised'. But this time round i can really see it and i have to admit she needs help. 

The thing different this time round is that if i discharge her she has no where to go to, shes homeless, she cant go back to her last supported housing hostel because she was verbally abusive to staff and other residents. The doctors have said she needs treatment and that they wont give her the same as the last times. I just don’t know what to do. 

Either she’s on the streets or they start the medication, which will be forced on her, with the risk of the side affects being as bad as last time and deepening the paranoia. She wants to be discharged immediately and is saying shed rather be on the streets. I feel if i go against her wishes, she'll start distrusting me. I also feel as though im taking away her freedom of choice. Its all messed up.  I love her and i cant see her suffer like this any more. I just want to think of a long term solution because it been going on for too long now and she deserves a life. 

I dont know what to do

58,"I think I might have borderline personality disorder, I was diagnosed with bi polar disorder 2 years ago but I didn’t know anything about bpd at the time my partner brought it to my attention he believes it’s why I am the way I am. Lately I’ve been so paranoid I’ve been hearing things?  It’s gotten so bad I hear this scratching in the walls of my room(no rodents)I’ve been hearing more voices then usual like I’ve heard voices my whole life but I knew they were me and now it’s like there someone else talking to me I flipped out one night and brought my dad in to here it and he said he couldn’t hear anything and it’s like my brain got so loud with this scratching noise it felt unreal and I spent the next 2 hours screaming in the mirror and crying in the bathroom, I locked myself In convinced there were demons in the walls that were gonna come kill me. I had a lot of trauma as a kid, my mom was a pain killer addict and my dad was abusive I was adopted and convinced my whole childhood I was kidnapped from my real parents and then was over that then contacted my my birth mom at age 12 and I asked about my birth dad and she told me who he was I contacted him only to be met with “she shouldn’t have had you” “I want nothing to do with you” and all that horrible stuff. My adopted dad got cancer when I was 13 and beat it then got lung cancer and is still dealing with that today. So then when I was 16 after many years of depression suicidal thoughts and attempts spending most my time in hospitals, I got a call from my birth mom to find out my birth dad who had a lot of addictions (drug addictions, also had bi polar disorder ) had killed himself. In the time I was in schooled I was bullied and pushed down and kicked for being so weird. I dropped out when I was like 14. (Currently trying to get my ged but everything seems to be failing) it’s like my brain is out to get me. I’m not sure how to handle this and it’s weird pouring out my problems to a reddit but hey when there’s nothing left. I’ve been trying to get into a therapist but insurance has been hard so. I don’t even know what I’d say, hey my name is blah blah blah and I’m hearing people and I think it’s either a shit ton of demons or my own mind, what’s your name? Like no. I sound insane. I am insane and I get this anger that just makes me blackout and I say horrible stuff and I don’t know how to fix it. I feel others emotions so much and it’s like I’m taken over and I can’t control what I say when I’m mad all there is is what’s the worst I can say to hurt someone like they’ve hurt me when in reality they just like said a small comment or criticized me or something not worth how angry I get. I’ve destroyed things and broken glass, punched walls, hurt myself, I’m constantly afraid of being alone because I think I will die. Like I honest to god believe if I’m alone because a room I will get killed. I’m almost 20 and I still can’t sleep with lights off because I see things in the dark that aren’t actually there. I usually have my mom sleep next to me because I hallucinate really creepy shit like talk black figures and crawling monsters. My parents thought it was night terrors when I was younger but when they didn’t stop 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
I haven’t been able to sleep right in idk how long now I can’t fall asleep till I pass out of exhaustion. I can’t just lay down at 10 pm and shut off like, I can’t keep my eyes close for to long because I” know someone’s walking towards my bed to kill me or some supernatural monster is staring at me from the corners.. I’m to the point of no sleep I feel like I’m turning into the people of nightmare on elm street.. I feel sick all the time cause I sleep like 3 hours and then random nights I’ll crash after a week or 2 of that and sleep for  15 hours straight. I just don’t know what’s going on with me. I have to say certain things multiple times because it has to be in 2’s so it’s not alone. I have to check the door is closed  a even amount of times. I have to make sure everyone I love knows I love them before they sleep or I’ll never see them again and they will die.. I feel so paranoid and so exhausted. I usually get hit with really good periods of time, I start sleeping good and eating good and all of the good things. Painting feeling hood about myself and I just get hit with  hugeeeee moments of life’s great I’m gonna go see the world I’m gonna clean everything I’m gonna do this and that and just everything. And then the last like 6 months have just been horrible. No highs at all expect for 2 weeks in late December I felt better and then it was bad again. I need a job but I start off really good and love it and2 weeks in I end up hating everything and having huge panic attacks and crying my whole shift and end up quitting. It happened 4 times within ) months.. I just I thought it might be good instead of laying there listening to things that aren’t real and stupid thoughts to write it all out and see if anyone out there has been through something similar and could tell me what to do to make it better.

65,"Hello, I’m not sure how to start this so I’ll just dive into it. I used to be very depressed when I lived at home and tried to end my life twice in the past but that was 2 years ago now. Since then I’ve gotten a good job with very good benefits, I moved states, I bought a good car, got my associates degree in less than a year and am currently working on my bachelors, and I’ve made a lot of progress with working out. In high school I had an amazing group of friends and I was doing lots of fun things and really enjoying life while being extremely depressed on the side which doesn’t really make sense but that’s the best I can put it. Since I made changes I haven’t been depressed but I still have my off days I suppose. My problem is I’ve been where I’m at for 3 months now and something has just changed with me since I got here. I’ve always been shy but have slowly grown out of that to where I’m not nervous when talking to people but now I just feel like I don’t have anything to say. All the conversations I have are meaningless regardless of what is being talked about and I don’t find interest in really anything that I do. I work, come home, eat, sleep, wake up, eat, workout, eat and then back to work and on my weekends I just sit at home watching tv but I don’t find any interest in it so I watch it just to watch it. It seems like I’ve forgotten how to seek out friendships and relationships and I’m just really apathetic towards everything. I feel like I’m a zombie going through the motions of whats expected of me and I don’t feel any emotion towards anything, whether it be good or bad. I meet people that I know I would get along with and have fun with but I just can’t talk to them the way I would have used to and actually connect with people and create new friendships. 

Apologies if it’s confusing in anyway but I would just really like some help or some guidance to where I can find help. Thank you ",22Mar2019,1

68,"The following occurred a very long time ago when I wasn't so grown up and responsible. I am not proud of the content described in this story! In fact I regret most of what took place.. I was deeply ashamed and embarrassed of how foolishly and irresponsibly I behaved..

Here goes...  

I had recently arrived in Phuket, Thailand, I was overexcited and had the intention of consuming substantial quantities of mind altering substances, in fact whatever was readily available to me. I was surprised and quietly pleased to find that specialised pharmaceutical products available only by prescription in Australia are readily available over the counter and are inexpensive at most pharmacies in some parts of Thailand. This included where I happened to be staying for a week long holiday and to celebrate my 30th birthday.

I regret partaking in all those forbidden fruits while I was over there on that one occasion as I went way too far!

I bought Yaba off any thin, random person on the street who was obviously a drug addict.

I was able to easily scope out and then approach these characters on the street.

I would say to them ""If you buy one for me, I will pay for two so that you can have one too.

This method of acquiring some serious illicit substances never failed me!

I smoked up on it pretty hard, It tasted like strawberries and made me feel quite euphoric!

This popular street drug combined with a cocktail of pills that would normally only be available by prescription in Australia. Some of these medications you would have to be very lucky to even obtain a prescription for in Australia! Xanax is a top example of this, in Australia this medication requires a government authority to fill the prescription. I stocked up on Tramadol, pseudoephidrine and 10 mg Valium.

It was most definitely a case of going way over board to say the least!

The thai to English translation of ""Yaba"" is ""crazy drug"", I guess I must have smoked too much because I discovered how it got it's name!

I acted like a fool and talked absolute garbage to anyone that would listen.

There was also one incident where I became completely paranoid, I was petrified that I was going to get my head caved in by this particular French Muay Thai boxer. I didn't like his style of fighting at all!

If I recall correctly, he did more dodging and hugging of the opponent so as to hold up the action then actual Muay Thai fighting, I was really disappointed by the lack of knees and elbows getting thrown.

This seemingly pitiful excuse for a Muay Thai fighter was wearing bright pink boxers shorts which I didn't much care for either. I was sitting in the grandstand making as many disrespectful comments as I could think of, directing them at this Muay Thai fighter for pretty much the entire duration of his fight.

At the end of the final fight for the night I realised that this particular French Muay Thai fighter that I'd taken such a disliking to had a girlfriend who had been sitting directly in front of me in the row down of the grandstand the whole time. When I saw the couple talking together beside the boxing ring I imagined that the French guy's girlfriend had heard every insult i had projected at her lover and was filling him in on every offensive comment that I had made during his recent fight.

I imagined that this French Muay Thai fighter was deeply insulted by my heckling, I was completely convinced that his girlfriend had immediately relayed every offensive comment that had come out of my mouth approximately 15 minutes earlier.

I imagined that this trained fighter was getting more and more angry as his girlfriend filled him in on every detail about the comments that I had unwittingly made.

I personally have never been in a fist fight and wouldn't know how to defend myself against an amateur. This guy was a professional, I was so irrationally and insanely fearful of my perceived reality. In the disillusion reality that I was experiencing at that time, the flouro pink shorts wearing French Muay Thai fighter was coming after me, seeking vengeance. I was 100% convinced that I was about to suffer the beating of my life. I was hiding behind people and objects, I was ducking down and constantly looking around me expecting to be standing in front of this angry man in any second. I was with a bunch of other people, but I didn't really take notice of what their movements were. I jumped into the first vacant ""Tuk Tuk"" that I saw just wanting to get out of my perceived danger as soon as I possibly could. One of my friends looked at me rather strangely as I made this move and called out to me, ""what are you doing?""

I don't recall what happened after that but I can pretty much be certain that I was behaving like some sort of a shameless lunatic.

I guess you could say that I was rendered temporarily insane by the stupendous consummation of illicit and prescription drugs I had foolishly consumed...

At the end of all this I felt an overwhelming feeling of shame and embarrassment because of my drug abuse and drug induced, totally inappropriate, normally completely unacceptable behaviour.

In summary I would have to say that I have deep regrets about my actions during this holiday and was bordering on the edge of insanity for almost the entirety of the time I spent in Phuket on that particular trip",22Mar2019,1

Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Aimee I am a second year trainee clinical psychologist at the University of Liverpool.

 I am completing a research study investigating the relationships between childhood trauma, mindfulness of voices, emotion regulation and levels of voice hearing distress and loneliness. It is important you are aware that for some people answering questions about their early childhood may be distressing. If you do experience any levels of distress you are advised to stop taking part in the study. You will be provided with a list of numbers and websites you can access if you feel you would like to talk to someone about the impact the study has had on you. 

The study is also looking at the types of voices people hear. Hearing voices is a relatively common and normal experience. We are interested in learning more about how people feel about their voices and the beliefs they hold about them.

&amp;#x200B;

It is hoped that the outcome of this research will have implications for future clinical practice.

The study is anticipated to last approx 20 mins. All participants have the opportunity to win 1 of 6 £25.00 Amazon Vouchers.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

For a while now (ever since we moved with my boyfriend on this island for his studies), I've been slowly but surely trickling down to a bad mental state.  
  
I think I've always been prone to depression (?) due to a bleak view of things. I had a bad childhood, death of my father, being gay and not being able to come out to family, bad relationship with mum and stepdad and other smaller things. The relationship with my mum and stepdad is now completely fixed and we discuss a lot of things, but I still can't bring up mental health and wellbeing with them because they shrug it off as a phase.  
  
What I've been feeling though does not seem like depression. I feel *seething hatred*. Towards people, situations and so many things, in and out of my control. I work at a copy shop, and customers are always pissing me off. I literally want to slap them because they complain about the price being 10 cents more than what they paid in another shop, I hate grannies for bringing me doilies they want to make copies of, people that tell me I'm lying about not being able to do so etc. The island I live in is full of immigrants as well. I hate them for wanting preferential treatment just because, when they can't even speak english to communicate.  
  
It's leaking into my personal life as well. I hate going out, I hate having to help people do stuff, I'm snapping at my wonderful boyfriend for minuscule things. I'm buying useless shit all the time, including smoking, so I constantly struggle with money (I'm only being paid 350€ which is a little anyway). I'm doing my master's thesis which is going sooo slow and I've already missed my deadline which means I have to pay a fine for an extension.  
  
I said I don't think I feel depressed. It's kind of true. I feel devoid of emotion. I think nothing matters, and nothing in my day proves me otherwise. I'm constantly having thoughts of suicide, not because I'm inadequate or sad, but because I will always have to face shit people and struggle to get to my next day.  
  
I don't know how I would even talk about these things to a shrink. I'm petty, spiteful and horrible to people that usually don't deserve it, and I don't think I would get any good advice from a psychologist that would just tell me to see good in people. Fuck people.",22Mar2019,1

74,"I work in a demanding human service field. I have been struggling with my mental health since I was 18 and lost my insurance due to my dad having to medically retire which meant I had to stop taking my medication and going to therapy all together. I managed to pull myself through for several years. I am 25 now, I graduated with a BA, and finally got my first job in the field, I had a meltdown shortly after and quit my job. I got lucky enough to find my current job and have been able to fight my anxiety long enough to get health insurance. As soon as I did I started going to therapy, from there my therapist and I decided it was time for me to get back on medication. I made a appointment, but the next earliest appointment was at noon on a Friday a month and a half out (today actually) unfortunately I had a supervised visit I had to oversee, no big deal I found a co worker to cover and took PTO. Fast forward to today my coworker that agreed to take my visit emailed the office (I shouldn't even be checking emails because I am on PTO but I am an overworker) she's sick, that's not her fault I appreciate her trying to take it in the first place. However now I am faced with even more overwhelming anxiety (I haven't slept through a night in a solid 3 months I woke up 3 times last night and at 5:30am had a complete breakdown and was crying this was all before I knew that my visit wasn't covered anymore) the visit is at the same time as my appointment, they're trying to find someone else to cover but there's a chance I am going to have to cancel my appointment (expensive and I'm already struggling financially) and reschedule it for at least another month out. I feel guilty because I put my mental health before my visit and now I'm just crying and overwhelmed by the fact that I was so close to help and it's being taken away. Just needed to vent.

I’m not even in a relationship so it couldn’t be the broken heart thing, but realized I’m never actually that happy when people in my life, friends or family, do great  even though I truly truly love them and always feel guilty about it. Now I think it’s because I’m so scared to be left behind when they get successful, I’m afraid they will just kick me to the curve once they realize I am not as interesting as them anymore and find someone better, someone more worthy of their time and I just feel I can’t keep up with them career or relationship wise, my group of friends still consists off my high school friends and we are all in our early 30s so there is so much time invested in this relationships it’s really hard thinking something like this could happen

76,"Hooked up a couple of times with this guy I met through a friend. I am really careful with who I sleep with as I have a history of physical abuse and I get scared of people getting close to me.

But I had a good gut feeling about this guy and he seemed really chilled out, and it was easy as we both established we didn't want anything more than sex. 

Long story short it didn't work out in the end, but the couple of times we had sex he was so careful with my body, asked me what I liked, made sure I felt comfortable and safe. He didn't know about my history of abuse but he was still so kind to me. 

Now I feel really overwhelmed and guilty that a stranger has been so loving and gentle, I'm really not used to being treated like that... I feel almost like being insulted and slapped around is my 'normal' even though I know logically it's not.

Been crying my eyes out as I keep getting these intense feelings of guilt and thoughts that I don't deserve that kind of treatment... gonna bring this up in therapy, but I guess I just needed to let it out... I'm also wondering if anyone else with a similar history has ever felt like this?

Also never really had friends. I had acquaintances at school, people to talk with until the bell rang I guess, but again, no bond. 

So now I’m 23 and really missing out on love. I don’t really want friends, I don’t want romance, I only want family love. But how do I deal with it? I’m 23. It’s too late to get love from parents (and I don’t want it from mine as they were neglectful or abusive). I know other people in similar situations tend to seek a life partner or friends, but what if I don’t want those? How do I deal with this in a healthy way? I try to deal with it but it’s all very unhealthy. I obsess over people who have been a parental figure in my life, and I also obsess over the wish for children  

I have had therapy before but they all insist I make friends. I don’t want friends, I want a sibling or a parent (or a child). I find friendships to be futile for most, mostly about good times. I don’t really want that. I want someone with whom I share most if not all of my daily life, through the good, bad, boring, routine-like, exciting, etc.

80,"Hey to make a long story short I had a traumatic incident a month ago which was a drug related. I somehow convinced myself the world was ending while I was on this drug and everyone in my life was stripped away from me. I don’t usually take drugs btw. I have been a bit of a mess since then but things are picking up. For the first 3 weeks I was depressed and extremely anxious. The past week has been better and I have enjoyed parts of the week. I started EMDR for trauma therapy last week. 

I know the trauma incident was all made up in my mind but I am left with this emotional numbness towards almost everything. It’s as if life is passing me by and I’m just getting through the days. I have started to meet up with my friends and stuff more recently which has led to me feeling better. However I still am left with this numbing emotion towards people and stuff I once loved. I feel like I am getting it back gradually though. I just want to know how long does this roughly last (or should it last) as I started EMDR relatively quickly after the incident. And also will I get all my feelings back? Appreciate the replies just kind of scared ",22Mar2019,1

This thought has been eating me up inside for over 2 weeks now and I'm scared for my own safety as I am in another war with myself and I don't think I'm going to win. The explanation I should have given is that my father has a very backwards view towards mental health issues and has often said that ""people with these problems are just faking to get attention"" and ""people who kill themselves a selfish"". My father is a very likable man but this regressive view makes me hate him. Suicide is not a selfish act, he just doesn't understand the pain that mental illnesses can cause, speaking from experience. This is the main reason why I was terrified to open up to my family but I'm going to force myself to face my fears. The stories I have read on this sub have encourage me to try and seek help and also I don't want to go through the pain of a suicide attempt again, especially the struggle of covering it up.

I'm actually feeling like I'm running out of time to jump in for some reason, I'm still youngish; nearly 30. My therapist is telling me I should not get into anything for the time being, as I've always *up until lately* been in some sort of project, my entire life.

84,"I would say that from age 14 through now (21), I've been phasing in and out of feeling immensely unhappy. If I had to quickly describe how I feel more precisely, I feel intensely lonely, hopeless, and have generally failed to find satisfaction in the cycle of life.

I'm constantly asking myself whether I actually have a problem; a question that becomes even more difficult to answer when my feelings of sadness phase out and I am able to function normally again for a significant period of time. Unfortunately, even when I don't feel sad, I never really feel happy at all, I just feel ""meh"". I was gifted a $2,000+ laptop last year out of nowhere by a friend who turned out to have a wealthy family and I felt almost nothing. My difficulty to feel happiness coupled with my extreme proneness to sadness is troubling.

Recently; however, I have been become ridiculously neurotic and what I would describe as unhealthily analytical. I'm often overthinking even the most basic of interactions to a ridiculous degree and it feels like I'm driving myself insane by doing so. My increasing tendency to think this way has suffocated my personality and undoubtedly made it exhausting for others to be around me. 

Although I've had strong feelings of unhappiness come and go for a while, it's never gotten to the point where I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of tears but unable to cry like I've felt recently. Part of this may be a result of my current ongoing struggle to understand myself coupled with the hatred I've felt for myself for as long as I can remember. It certainly feels like I've been spending an unhealthy amount of time on introspection, and I would suspect that it is negatively affecting my mental health. 

I realize that this reads very much like a rambling train of thought, and I apologize for that. I am having a rather difficult time conveying my emotions right now, but I need a second opinion on what I've been feeling recently. I also consider it unwise to talk about this with friends in real life because I know how relationships can change for the worse when you admit this to them.

I’ve been on anti-depressants for almost 3 months now and haven’t noticed any change. I don’t think I’ll try to kill myself again, mainly because I saw how upset my Mum was last time. But I think about suicide almost constantly and most of the time I feel like I’m really not coping. The main problem I have is that I’m very private and I don’t ask for help when I need it - I know that if I felt that low again I wouldn’t tell anyone. 

I don’t know if I should go to hospital to be monitored. I’ve seen psych wards and they’re scary places. I also have a job (just skype tutoring) that it’d be a nightmare to quit.

I always felt comfortable and able to talk to my mom about things than my dad. There’s always been a sort of comfort opening up to women.

Additionally, I’ve been bullied in the past. Being ignored by my father hasn’t helped me self esteem either. The thought of opening up to a man about my issues of self esteem seems daunting, yet on the only hand, something that’s important to do. I’ve never had healthy relationships with other men.

Before I can start writing articles, my OCD will force me to check the coding of my website. I need to check the coding of my website before I have the confidence and I am ready to upload the website live and present the website to real users online. I am now only left with 2 php scripts and a total of 10 css files to check my coding. The css files only have a few lines of code, so I am not worried about checking the coding on my css files. I am worried about the 2 php scripts. I wrote a lot of coding and I need to check the coding. Damn it, my OCD.

I used to check the entire coding of my website more than 3 times. It is a very debilitating OCD condition. Luckily, I sought the help of my counselor and my psychiatrist. I told my psychiatrist about my OCD and he had given me heavy dosage of clomipramine and paroxetine. My OCD and depression are now more manageable. I don't have to check the entire coding of my website more than 3 times and I am no longer that afraid that there might be some coding errors on my website.

The words they spoke had no meaning. They belonged to no language. It all sounded like a growl. An ear-splitting scream. The screams resounded across the small room. Made smaller by their presence. Suffocating me. Trapping me in the middle. 

I could see the exit behind their masses. But they shrouded me, towering over as I stood cowering like a wet dog. No way to escape. No way to silence the unforgiving noise. No way to protect my eyes from the harsh scene, that seemed to engulf me...



I awoke; for a moment. As the light flooded in, I squinted waiting for my eyes to adjust. But they didn’t have enough time, before I was back in the loud, dark, crowded room. Again being encased in the seemingly never ending moment. As the amount of oxygen in my lungs continued to decrease - causing me to gasp for air that was no longer there- I clawed at my skin. It burned as it engraved its harsh indecipherable words into my benumbed flesh. Carving out its wishes. It’s desires. Begging me to comply. 

And I did...

Now as I lay a ripped rag doll mistaken for a pin cushion, my eyes peel back allowing me to take in the light. To take in what I had just done. My head spun in it’s daze. The control I once had over my own limbs, replaced with ones of horror and misery. The foulness so tainted there is no cure. No prevention.

93,"Hi all, I am a first time poster on this subreddit. I recently went to a mental health seminar where we discussed how to recognize someone who may be struggling with mental health, the best way to approach them, and how to refer them to the resources available to them.   


One topic that I had a difficult time with was the concept of recognizing your own limits. In other words, before helping someone, check to see if you are in a state of mind or have the energy to be helping. If your tank is depleted and you cannot pay attention to the person in need, you could make the situation worse by coming off like you are pretending to care.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is - how do you gauge that? Everyone is busy, everyone has their own issues to deal with, and if you try to help someone but quickly realize ""this is too much for me at the moment"", I suspect it would be worse to walk away or to pass it on to someone else, when you are the one they have a rapport with.  Is trying better than not trying? I don't want to do more damage by actively listening to them over a week and then I suddenly can't make time for them.

94,"My brother was a year older than me. When he was 3, our dad died. He was diagnosed with depression and OCD as early as I can remember. I always held everything in, he always acted out. As we grew up, I got better and better at holding it in and he acted out more and more. I remember suicide threats and talk of voices before we even reached middle school. He started abusing alcohol and drugs at a very young age. 

At 20, he went to prison for 2 years, when he got out he started off great, he found a girl who was also clean and sober. She had heart issues and was told if she was ever going to have kids, she’d need to do it now. So my nephew was conceived and things got worse. After he was born it got worse for her too. They both were using again, off and on. 

Then his mind went into complete schizophrenia. He would say he saw us being murdered and would cry when he saw we were okay. Even in the darkest times of his life he cared about his families safety. That diagnosis of schizophrenia saved his life, for a short time. 

All those meds caused him to gain double his body weight in less than a year. He developed terrible lung and heart issues. He would sleep with a breathing tube. Despite the health issues, he was able to get full custody of his son! He loved him and cared for him. 

On Sunday, my step-dad went to check on him when he didn’t come out for lunch (they all lived together). He was on the floor, not breathing. Our first instinct was that he overdosed, given his history of drug abuse and being suicidal. They checked all his meds and he hadn’t taken anything extra. The medical examiner says it was respiratory and heart failure. 

Now his son is 3 and lost his father. The same age he was when it happened to us. His mother has had two strokes in the last 6 months, has used both meth and heroin in the last 3, and has her ongoing heart issues. My mom and stepdad have received emergency custody so his mother can’t take her.

I was the one who told him what happened, but at first I thought he didn’t understand. I told him that his dad died and that’s why we’re all sad but he said “I’m not sad” and asked to play his video game. The next couple days have gone by though and he hasn’t asked where his dad is (he had already asked others 3 times that day before I told him). Yesterday my sister said he told her he misses his dad. I wonder if my brother told him not to be sad if he dies. 

What can I do to make sure his son doesn’t go down this same path of mental illness? I’m so worried for him. My mother has severe anxiety, to the point she is legally disabled. She has a lot of help from others but I know her anxiety affected me and my brother tremendously and he is already saying “I’m scared” multiple times a day and not wanting to leave the house. Once he’s out he has a great time but I asked a couple times if he wanted to go to the park and he’s just say “no I wanna be home” which worries me, but maybe it’s just because he’s sad.

95,"Going to start off my saying I am not associated with MedaCube by PharmAdva at all. I have only owned one for several months, but in those several months it has changed my life by making the particular cocktail of drugs I needed possible. 

A little backstory, I spent most of my teens and 20's struggling with substance abuse, anxiety, depression, low self esteem and a general lack of motivation to do anything. I've seen some of the best psychiatrist in Orange County as well as in Houston. They tried a variety of cocktails that probably would of worked decent, however, they all failed miserably because of my inability to correctly take my medication. I would burn through any medication with any abuse potential in days. 

Cut to my early 30s. Things are going well, I am clean and sober, but in general miserable. I hate myself, I hate life. I am afraid of all medications because of my past experiences. I have gone back to school but I am struggling to makes B's as I am unable to concentrate for more then 20 minutes at a time before I dive back into compulsive video game playing, movie watching or social media. 

I finally decide enough is enough and go see a doctor. The cocktail I get put on is adderall, limictal, propanolol, and wellbutrin. 

However, again I am unable to take my adderall properly. The cocktail fails and I tell the doctor to remove the adderall, which he does, but says he is willing to try it again in the future. 

Fuck this its 2019, modern problems require modern solutions. I am an adult, I can find something that will regulate my medication for me.  I look around and try several different options. All of them fail some were just not tamper resistant and allowed my lack of will power to easily skip a few days. Others were built like tanks but were overly complicated and annoying to use. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally settled on the 1600$ MedaCuba. Holy fuck, 1600$ yes. Its expensive but it works and has allowed me to correctly take my adderall as presribed which has made a 100% improvement in my motivation, school, and self esteem. I am finally on my last quarter of schoool. I will finally graduate and I am studying to take the real estate test. 

So if you are struggling with compliance issues check out the medacube. I know its expensive, but its a great machine that can change lives. 

With that being said if you are truly desperate you could get into this thing with tools. So maybe look at some of the stronger, cheaper, but more complicated models.

My mother has bipolar and will never come off medication and to be honest, she is really messed up even with the meds. I desperately want to feel ‘normal’.

I am very lucky in that I have a very supportive husband, fantastic children and a great job. However I have no real friends or other support from siblings or parents and I feel like everything could slip away from me at any moment. 

I just want to know, will I ever feel better or is this it now? Are there alternatives to medication? I just don’t see things getting better and on my bad days this makes me feel like I shouldn’t be here.

Happy Friday, I hope you're all doing well! I wanted to reach out to see if any of you would want to share your story on our platform. We started a company, PEAR (Positive Engagement And Response), with hopes of making the world a more open, safe, connected &amp; positive place to live.

We have cards that we created that are used to open up communication in a fun, non-intimidating way in hopes of bringing people closer together, and letting kids &amp; others open up and have meaningful conversations. 10% of those profits are donated to Mental Health America, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation, as we want to help out the mental health organizations as much as possible. It's very near and dear to our heart.

The other part of our company so far (which is why I'm here) is centered around our blog (and hopefully a podcast soon) where we want people to open up and share their stories with the world. Things that they have overcome, or problems they've gone through and came out stronger/grew through the experiences. I wanted to reach out to any of you on here that feel strong enough or want to have their voice heard. I know that writing out your feelings is one of the best ways to come to grips with issues, or grow and become stronger by ""letting it out"". Most subjects are open, and If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

There are so many amazing people out there who've been through hell and back or people who can help others by sharing a little of their life, so if that's you, PLEASE contact us. Together we can hopefully help end stigmas, and create a closer connection and ability for people to open up and share personal stories and thoughts with one another. You can DM me, leave a comment here, or reach out to us at contact@pearcards.com!

Thank you very much, and have a great rest of your weekend!

  But I am not talking about your vessel. I am talking about the mysterious entity that peers out of your eyes. I am talking about YOU. I am no religious man but surely this is beyond biology.

Ill tell you what the truth is. Consciousness is the same through and through. Everyone is the same hunk of clay. We can be copied as many times as the higher power wants. When we are born we just get sent into any open spot. This is where the coin toss happens. You either live and be consious and aware or if the ""soul"" doesnt reach the body then you are a perfect copy of someone who thinks they are alive and aware. A walking, talking, biological robot who sincerely believes that he/she is a conscious lifeform. 

I am here today because I think I lost that coin toss. I have a good feeling that I am actually an unconscious shell. The awareness that I have isnt awareness at all, I have been teeling myself that it is but misidentifying it because it is the only think I know. ",22Mar2019,1
100,"Hey everyone.

 I’m having a pretty rough time with my anxiety and depression flaring up (diagnosed with major depression 10 yrs ago, GAD 3 years ago). I’m currently working part time from home and in college full time. It’s gotten to the point where I am no longer sleeping, I stay up all night with a stomach ache and the jittery feeling. I finally can get myself to bed around 9-10am however it’s making it really hard for me to get to class and I’m falling behind. Most days I can’t get myself to leave the house. I try so hard. I even get myself to get ready and then I just freeze and feel like there is no way I can do it. I’m constantly paranoid something bad is going to happen for no reason. 

I think it’s important to note that I haven’t received treatment In what will be a year in April. I lost my health insurance, I am unable to get Medicaid due to making just a bit above the income limit (however just enough to pay only my bills) my employer does not offer health benefits and a plan through the marketplace is entirely over my budget, not to mention I looked at the providers and there are only 3 mental health providers that accept the insurance and they happen to be 3 hours away. I’ve been suicidal for a week now and I really want to get help and feel human again. I just feel like I have no options. I’ve considered checking myself into a psychiatric hospital but the debt I will be forced to pay afterwards I think is too much for me to handle. Not only that but once I get out I will be back in this same situation, not being able to get the follow up treatment I really need. 

I feel so entirely hopeless. I really just feel like there’s absolutely nothing I can do to fix this, but I’m hoping someone on here knows of any additional resources I’ve not thought of. Thanks so much to anyone that reads this.

102,"I have an eventful timeline and am curious as to how much of my mental health is a result of that vs my brain map. Both of my parents have issues. My dad did hard drugs for years and my mom has been through some stuff, so it is hard for me to know where things went wrong. 

For some background -

Ages 5-6: Mom’s super abusive boyfriend beats/rapes her and I. Involved in kp. Threatens to kill my family and murders my bunny rabbit. 
Mom suspects something happened to me when I was younger than this and asked if my grandpa ever touched me. 

Age 10: Wake up to best friends 16 yr old brother molesting me while all of the family is asleep in the hotel room. 

Also age 10: Mom has remarried and he is also abusive. Finds out about friends brother and teaches me about “good and bad” touch. Starts molesting me short after. Goes on until 14. 

Age 17: Go to party and get drugged. 2 legal adults guy and gal try to rape me, but current step-dad (she remarried again) tracks my phone and kicks down door. 

18-present - a series of “coercion” situations where I can’t even tell the difference based on what has happened that was worst in the past. 
Someone tried to rape me a few years ago on Halloween, then a similar boundary crossing situation just last year when a guy ripped my pants off when I said NO. Another “pretended” to kidnap me for 10 hrs when crossing state lines (as in it was not a game and I was really scared). Neither were successful. 

My family tried to sweep all of this under the rug and have never really been emotionally available. They very much have the “get over it” mindset. Tried to bring it up to my mom recently and she said I am overreacting. My current step-dad is emotionally abusive, but he is at least a step up from the other men in her life. Somehow I feel like I have victim stamped on my forehead for how many times I have been in a bad situation. I can’t even confess all of this to anyone for fear they will blame me or something. 

The best therapist I’ve had said that most of my issues are account of PTSD. I am curious if there is a way to tell the difference.

I wouldn't say i'm scared of doctors, but i'm scared that they'll find something wrong with me. How i can get over this fear, and what's the best way to approach a physician about this topic?",22Mar2019,1
106,"Hello all! Before I get started, I know that self-diagnosis isn’t always accurate or healthy. However, I also know that having a potential name helps me and my doctor/Therapist tremendously. If it makes a difference, I have also been professionally diagnosed with Chronic Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, etc. 

I’m not sure when it started, but I noticed it around 7th grade (I am in 10th now). Anytime I would skip breakfast because I was late to the bus, or my mom didn’t have time to make one, my stomach would growl around 3-4 hours later, sometimes sooner. That’s normal. What isn’t normal is that whenever it would, I liked it. I liked the way it vibrated and I liked the way it hurt. It made me wanna continue to not eat so I could feel it again.

I think the weirdest part is, I don’t really have body issues. Yeah my hips could be rounder, and maybe my arms a little beefier, and god my acne is bad, but I’m not ugly, and I’m not fat or super skinny. If anything I’m just average. I don’t hate my body. 

Is this a thing? Starving yourself for no reason? Is this some weird form of self harm? Is there actually some hate deep down that I don’t recognize??? Please help, I hate feeling like this.",22Mar2019,2

Today I wrote a note. I've never done that. It was upsetting to write and read, but then I deleted it and I felt much better than I had before I wrote it.
I don't like this. I told my primary care doctor about this. She was a wonderful listener and suggested we up my antidepressants for now and check back in 2 weeks.
I told her I have never told anyone about these thoughts before. She urged me to tell my therapist and a friend, but also gave me her personal number for emergencies.

110,"This might be long...but hear me out, 

Let me give a little background to my life and who I am... 

I grew up in a southern US small town with a lot of bible thumpers, drug addicts, rednecks, etc etc you get it. 

I am an only child. My mom and dad divorced when I was three. My dad had a drug problem and decided to move me away to western US to let him get his shit together. During this time, he died when I was 7..

This caused me and my mom to move back to my original town so I could be with my family. I basically grew up with my dads family more than my moms naturally because we were coping with our mourning of my father together. 

This side of the family are very religious Christians who basically brainwashed me to no end (my conclusion now in life being 22). They hated my mother because she was “atheist” if you wanna say...and they thought she wasn’t a good mother to me. 

Well....she wasn’t. She was a single mother who was still in a college mindset (she had me at 19) 
and never showed me any affection whatsoever. She was like my roommate. Always bringing guys home and locking her door for hours. And we would fight like sisters. I pretty much viewed my grandma as my mom.  She bought me everything took me everything and showed me so much love. 

At 16 years old I moved to Germany. Crazy right. From a small town to Germany. My mom had met someone online married him and so we moved there. 

My first year there my grandma was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer...I was away and she became sicker and sicker.  November of my senior year she died. I had lost my father now, my mom was never a mom, and now the only one who truly took care of me, my grandma, was gone. 

My relationship with my mother throughout high school and first few years of college gradually improved, but I still don’t ever talk to her often. She’s a very selfish woman. 

Anyways, now that I explained some of my background...I wanted to talk about why I’m writing this post in the first place. 

I have done my fair share of drugs in college, weed, alcohol, MDMA, coke, speed, ket...in fact there was a year that I was getting fucked up every single weekend. European Techno parties man. Now, I have stopped all of that. But I still feel like it has taken an enormous  toll on my emotional state and my personality in general. 

I spend my days not happy. I spend my days thinking about questions like why are we here, what are we, what will happen when we die? These questions race through my head daily. I feel like I’m just waiting to die, nothing ever makes me happy because I know all moments have an end. 

I always am stuck on the fact that there is an end. To everything. Happy moments, and life in general.  I am such an introvert now, when I used to be outgoing. I snap at people, when I used to be chill. I never answer my phone or my messages. Heck, lucky if I even open them before 3 days. 

I don’t know why I am like this. My past? I feel like I didn’t have the greatest childhood ever. My dads death?  mom not giving a fuck?  my religious grandparents who told me to hate my mom and Jesus is the only way if not I’m gonna burn in hell? My grandmas death?? Everything combined?????? Drugs??? 

I am willing to see someone, I just don’t want to feel crazy and in my head. I want to be happy. And not think these ways. Idk if this is straight up depression? I’ve never come to terms with my mental problems, but it’s getting to the point where I can’t really bare it. ",22Mar2019,2
111,"Recently I sat down with psychiatrist who spent 3 hours with me and listened to my story before giving me giving me a diagnosis that hit the nail right on the head. I'm finally getting the help I need. Until then I had been misdiagnosed by other psychiatrists who gave me 50 minutes, sped me through, and gave me meds that didn't get to the root of the problem.  The therapists I've worked with had a full understanding of by past and behavior, but were very reluctant to put a diagnosis to it.

I've seen many folks online tell people to go see a therapist for their diagnosis, but it doesn't seem like they would have the medical training to do so. What's been your experience? ",22Mar2019,1

I've been having trouble finding therapy. There's been a learning curve for me here in Oregon and it seems that even though I knew I had medicare original and Moda Health, I didn't know I had medicaid through OSIPM, plus I made some mistakes communicating that I'm fairly certain my issues involve anxiety or some form of anxiety... but, no I'll leave that to another post because I'm getting a headache now.

Any way, I'm finding the more I search for therapy, the more I feel almost like pleading or begging for help in a way because I hate doing this and it hurts my head and I feel like I'm on a timeline because my issues involve insecurities about my age...
So, but, I'm wondering is me... uh
I don't know how articulate I'm being, but is me looking for a therapy really hard... maybe a sign that I'm using it as a crutch ? Like is it just giving me a venue for me to th ink about my problems and make them worse by trying to get help when I should just solve the problem myself or maybe I'm making it hard when its not because I'm relating to my age? 
I feel like I don't know what I'm doing? I feel like maybe I'm doing something wrong? Like what if I'm just making myself be some kind of attention whore what if I turn into someone that just focuses on imaginary problems all day? How do I know my problems are real and not things i can get over? Why is th is so hard how do I ground myself when I have no one to refer to? But I should be able to think clearly on my own without help? But I don't have any close friends...
I'm so confused...",22Mar2019,1

We’re 3 Brits who have experienced a range of mental health issues. Our experiences range from mild anxiety and depression to dropping out of school and university due to agoraphobia and extreme anxiety.

In our lives we’ve been trying various things to get better and thought working on something together would be good for us.

Counter intuitively we’re all quite optimistic about the future for humans so our experiment is a YouTube channel that discusses the future, history, economics, current events and other things to help educate others.

Alex – records the audio, and help script and research

Seb - does the video and audio editing

Joel – helps research and script and find video material

We’ve found it helpful in motivated us, getting us on track and boosting our moods and have had some great positive feedback.

We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to be involved in our little collective to see if it might help you too.

Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe putting ideas out for topics or getting involved in research and/or script writing.

Feel free to try us out in getting involved to see if you like the experience and find out it helps you.",22Mar2019,1
116,"My history with my mental health hasn’t been great but the more things have been moving the more I realize how unstable and unsustainable it is in the state that I’m in. I’m in my second semester of college which has been interesting in that it has allowed me to better separate myself from the place that I come from
Being around people constantly has made me realize that the way my mind changes from one thing to the next like isn’t .. normal? My mood swings tend to be frequent and drastic, from a state of extreme panic to sadness to extreme euphoria and anger. I get extremely panicked about projects specifically (so multiple times a week) and emotionally break down very frequently that tend to be directed towards myself or one other person (guy that I’m dating but is basically my best friend and I care a lot about)
Only at one point recently has this really affected more people around me other than myself or one other person but I think that in itself has caused me to realize how completely unsustainable my current methods are
The way I think about things also changes constantly. I tend to devote myself solely to one person intensely but that even shifts depending on the time from complete devotion to utter dismissal, I can go from one extreme to the other very very quickly despite it being to a person I care about deeply and been through so much with. I tend to isolate myself and as a result my anger tends to be released towards myself and said one other person, scared of being abandoned tend to turn suicidal/ think about it a lot when completely alone. I also tend to be very destructive (luckily not a lot of exposure to substances just based on who I’ve been associated with ) but subsequently engage in self destructive behaviors when I can.
I know I need to do something about this especially when I’m in a place where I have more freedom and could get more help on my own. I also know I need to prepare myself because I know I’m going to be alone for a little while soon. 
I know self diagnosis is a bad way to gauge, but I recently read a description on borderline personality disorder and don’t know when I’ve related to anything more. The way that I am has effected so much and I don’t know what to do",22Mar2019,2
117,"[21M] I’ve been diagnosed Bipolar II for about a year and a half now. Before the diagnosis I was struggling with depression and anxiety (the two usually went hand in hand). 

I’ve been taking medication and the symptoms have greatly improved on both sides of the spectrum. 

This past week I have had three of the worst panic attacks in a long time. Nothing has changed in my life in any facet (stress, diet, exercise, medication consumption or dose, etc.) No trauma, sickness, or injury. 

The first two times it happened at night, around 8-9 P.M. All of I sudden I felt exhausted, and within 30 minutes I was panicky and shaking. My entire body felt uncomfortable and I couldn’t stop flexing my muscles to try and relax them/moving my fingers and toes. My mind was racing. It felt like I needed to cry, but couldn’t. The next time happened this morning just after one last night. 

I’ve never experienced anxiety outside of depression. This sudden onset and the symptoms are also different from when I had anxiety before. It used to be a certain pressure in the chest mixed with general fear of my life and surroundings. 

What might have started this? Is this a completely different anxiety than the type I’ve experienced during depression? 

I’ve set an appointment with my doctor and will be looking into therapy/medication depending on what he suggests. 

I would like to hear if other people experience this and what to do about the symptoms. The first time it happened getting in the shower helped a lot, the second time it made it worse. I tried music, nature sounds, and even Weightless by Marconi Union. Open to all advice and suggestions.

Just want some feedback and if I should send the message at all:

I want to start this off by saying I don’t expect forgiveness, frankly I don’t deserve it – never the less I want you to know I’m sorry for the way I treated you. I let the worst of me take over and I hurt you time and time again because I wasn’t strong enough. It still weighs heavily on me, guilt I feel unable to let go of no matter how hard others try. I’ve told you about my struggles on whether I’m a good person. Usually I can at least accept some counter point to my guilt – but nothing has changed when it comes to you. I felt insulted when a psychologist tried to ease those feelings, that somehow you should’ve just accepted my unacceptable behaviour because a relationship is a two-way street. I would have walked right out of his office if I wasn’t so stunned by what he said. I’ll repeat what I said at the start: I don’t deserve forgiveness, I seek acceptance that when I’m in the closest I’ve been to my right mind in a long, long time – I’m sorry. 

I hope these are the last words I say to you – I don’t want us to make up and be friends, I’m washing my hands of this and doing what you’ve already done: moving on with my life.

I have a real brain to mouth problem with speech and can't pass interviews or have meaningful friendships. It's also caused social anxiety which makes the problem even worse. My mind just goes blank from anxiety.

I've been at my job that I find boring as hell for two years, and I am socially isolated. I've worked a lot of different job and taken all kinds of career tests. The conclusion I've come to is that I just hate to work and feel like the middle years of life are a 40 year prison sentence. I hate working so much that I just want to get on some kind of strong medication so I don't even have to think until I'm retirement age. 

I've turned off my personality, emotions, and everything, but thinking still makes everything worse. I'm very absent-minded and tend to just get lost in daydreams when I'm doing things that don't interest me, which is almost everything. And then I end up putting up with insults and complaints on the job when I overlook something. I just want to go through the motions in peace without being noticed. I want to just be a vegetable.

I've tried anti depressants. They didn't work. I've tried therapy. It doesn't work. I've studied CBT and methods of hypnosis and psychological control to use on myself, and it was also ineffective.

Doctors here in rural Iowa really don't know or care what's going on with me.

I was told by an autism specialist that I don't have autism when I was a little kid. I thought about going to get tested again as an adult, but they wanted $1000 for it.  The greatest problems that autistic people face are the few problems I don't have. Understanding other people's emotions and behaviors is something I do intuitively. My problem is that I can't put my thoughts into words and have a conversation.
