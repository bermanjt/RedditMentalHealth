0,"The physical and mental energy spent to achieve happiness doesn't seem to be working out for me.  I mean happiness is the goal after all right? I have been up and down for a decade but feel i am in quite a deep rut at the moment. I have no goals or aspirations. I just exist probably for the sole fact that my parents are amazing people and I would hate to devastate them. I have money to spend, but when I ask myself what I am interested in doing I can't come up with an answer. I'm drifting away from my hobbies. I'm tired of the way the arts are moving and struggle to find new tv shows, movies or music that interest me. I'm trying to date, but I think its mostly out of boredom and I'm struggling to put my best effort in with such low motivation.",08Jul2019,2
1,"Long story short I used to hear voices or see things that were not there every once and a while. I've been locked in a psych ward twice but never told them this. I'm supposed to take anti psychotics, sleeping pills, anti anxiety pills, and anti depressants but I stopped taking them all cold turkey about a month ago. The thing is, I felt great for a while but recently my delusions, voices and hullicianations have come back with a vengeance, to the point where when I'm no longer ""lucid"" I can't hide it anymore. 

I don't know what to do because I don't want to end up locked up for a third time this year, or be medicated. I kinda like the voices when they're not overwhelming, and tom the demon is nice,  just really scary looking. The biggest issue is when I can't tell what's real or not real anymore. Today I was laying in bed and I completely lost track of reality for a solid 10 minutes, thought I was somewhere else. What do I do?",08Jul2019,0

12,"I have not been diagnosed yet, but I'm hoping to sometime in the future. I'm confused because I don't know if adhd could be causing these issues or not. I show symptoms like losing things, being unorganized, fidgeting a lot, being impulsive, and somewhat forgetting things. My main issue is that no matter how much I try to change, I can't stop procrastinating and being lazy. I just can't get myself to do the things I don't want to do, but need to do. At the same time though, I can focus on things that I love to do without any trouble. I just don't feel normal because I can't seem to stop this. I see others be able to get up early in the morning and just do things, but for me, I struggle to do that. Some days I can do it if I have enough motivation, but most days I struggle. I just feel like there has to be something deeper going on. And I think it might be adhd. However, I still think that I dont have it at the same time because there are symptoms that I dont have as well. Such as, making careless mistakes, trouble staying in my seat, trouble waiting my turn, trouble listening to people or when they are talking to me. These are all symptoms that I dont have. Or at least I haven't noticed myself having these symptoms. I don't know, does this sound like I could have adhd? I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I just want to know if it's possible that i have it even though there are symptoms that I dont have.

13,"[Short backstory] —I have been in a wonderful relationship with a man I trust dearly and love so much. I have a pretty extensive history with mental health issues/ a sexual trauma, but have been healthy and doing very well for a while now. He has always been thoughtful and helpful with any of my struggles.

Last weekend he wanted to try something new during sex. Long story short, I had my hands cuffed behind my back, he accidentally pushed them extremely extremely tight to where they’re cutting into my wrists, I’m losing sensation in my hands, and I’m face down, naked, sobbing into a pillow. Beside the fact that it immediately stirred horrific memories from something that happened years ago because I’m exposed, and at a complete lack of control, the pain I felt in my wrists was unlike anything I’ve experienced. It was unbelievably painful. He obviously stopped immediately and tried to remove them, but couldn’t and I was stuck screaming and sobbing for probably 5 minutes before he got them off. Since then I can’t even imagine having sex without panicking. He’s been so kind and apologetic but I seriously feel traumatized. It kills me to talk about, but the second I do he shuts down and is upset. How do I cope with this experience?",08Jul2019,1

15,"# Social Media impacts on youths

Social media has caused many health problems in youths such as increase in depression and anxiety. This is due to the fact that social media causes people to compare themselves to others. This causes insecurity and causes people to lack self worth by wearing what others are wearing and by trying to look like others. Regardless of gender, youths appeal to those on social media who have physical body traits such as abs and big muscles which causes youths to desperately try and lose weight and take excessive actions to try and gain the look they desire. This has caused many problems in which youths have turned to unhealthy starvation, excessive fasting and working out to much. This causes lots of health problems which can cause a risk to their lives.

This is just a very small percentage of all the severe impacts that social media causes towards youths. Instead of complaining that youths shouldn't be using social media and instead of blaming parents for bad parenting, we should instead focus on trying to get rid of this image that looks matter, that body size matter, that the cost of outfits matter because if we don't, the next generations will turn into a population of mental health problems such as severe depression, severe anxiety and even as far as suicide. 

## Cases

According to the World Health Organization, in the year 2019, approximately 1.53 million people will die from suicide. There is increasing evidence that this behavior of using social media affects and changes people's lives, especially in teenagers. 

For respect I decided to not include any real life cases as I don't think a sensitive topic like this is something you can give examples for. However, there have been hundreds of cases where teenagers have taken their own life's due to constant online harassment, bullying, blackmailing sensitive/extreme pictures and more.

## Conclusion

We need to act together as a population to solve these problems before it affects our children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.",08Jul2019,1

17,"I felt so stupid. People who are less privileged than me, less educated, and have more challenges in their everyday lives can do this stupid job with no problem. It isn't a challenging job. I don't know what it is, it's like I lack some fundamental filter to the outside world. I am such a little bitch. Everything makes me cry.

For a little background, I just recently graduated high school. But since I was in sixth grade, I've been having debilitating panic/anxiety attacks everyday at school. I actually found a way to solve this problem -- after two stints in the clink (outpatient mental health treatment) I transferred to a much smaller school where I could do more of my work at home. I was comfortable and even pretty happy in that environment. 

However, after graduating, I decided it was time to get a job. So I applied for a certain big box store and got the job. But it was kind of weird, they interviewed me and then had me fill out the paperwork saying that I was hired on the same day, with no one ever actually offering me the job or giving me the opportunity to consider it. Since that first experience, I have continued to notice a lot of poor communication, even in only having worked two full days.

So today, my second full day, I received very little training and was told to go off and do it all on my own. I didn't really know what I was doing. People kept asking me questions that I didn't know the answer to. And when I told them I didn't know they were very angry and mean. 

Another thing, a really stupid thing -- we're supposed to communicate through walkie-talkies, but I cannot for the life of me use one. I have a really severe phone phobia (if I had to name my number one stressor/cause of anxiety, it'd be phones) and the walkie talkie is like that times one hundred. So I know I'm supposed to page someone over it, but it just makes me so anxious. See, I feel so dumb when I write it out. Like, when I read it or think about it, all I can think about is how the anxiety is just an emotion and I need to get over it. But that isn't what it's like in real life. In practice.

So, even though this is a dumb easy job, it's too hard for me. I really, really want to quit. I can hear my parents fuming at me already but I really just can't take it. My therapist would tell me not to, I'm positive. But this is... awful. It's really incredible how after so long of living in remission from my anxiety disorder, the right trigger can be a catalyst for some really dreadful and long lasting stuff.

I would really appreciate some kind words or advice if you have any. Do I stick around just out of principle?

(As a side note, I'd like to say that I actually do have something else lined up -- but it won't begin until a little later, starting in August).",08Jul2019,1
18,"I just dont feel like any of my day to day life matters anymore. its the same thing over and over without gaining ground and always falling back.


I cant figure out what to say or put it into better words so bare with me.   

ive cried myself to sleep for almost a week now, during this time I've also broken down a number of times just into a ball of sorrow and misery. I feel nothing for my family and friends anymore, like they feel worthless to me, not in a ""disgusted to be near them"" but I feel like I just dont care anymore sort. 


I feel dread every day just to go to work and its worn me out. my anger problems are coming back and I feel the blind rage swell up whenever I serve people now. It's to the point i cant even keep to my schedule anymore and I miss 1 or 2 days out of my 5 shifts a week (somehow I'm not fired after almost half a year of this). I feel hatred and disgust for the customers whenever I'm there and i cant even view them as people anymore. 


I've been having trouble remembering things for a while now. I've woken up and forgotten my name, I cant remember what I've done half the time and I feel like its gradually getting worse. though I've heard this is just me getting into a rut. 

I feel a mixture of having no care, sadness and anger all the time like as if I'm an animal backed into a corner. I cant even remember what I was typing about for half these sentences , which is why they may seem to be all over the place and it's taken me 25 maybe 30 minutes just to get here. 

I will say that there is something I am feeling drawn too, which seems stupid and out of the question but it's to join a catholic monastery for some reason. like what little time I've had to think is spent on the thought of it.






I'm sorry if this breaks any rules of the sub. but I felt like I had to get atleast part of this out (I'd be here for half a day getting through all of it) and I only ever feel the need to reach out is when I'm really tired and I regret and feel anger towards myself for thinking it.",08Jul2019,3
19,"I felt a bit of a connection to Rue from the start.. When I was little I was diagnosed as fucked, basically. Like, throughout my years, I literally received each of Rue's diagnoses (exact same). And though I had a fucked up adolescence, it wasn't until college when my stepdad got sick and died. Which coincidentally led to some pretty heavy drug exploration.. Though, like the reversal of Rue, it was first triggered when I discovered my sexuality was really not that straight. I fell for a new best friend of mine, and I found out she was in love with a girl that very much so wasn't myself. But yeah, I lost it that semester mentally, and I resorted to pretty heavy usage of drugs and alcohol. Nothing as serious as Rue, by no means, but like.. psychedelics and A LOT of marijuana was very common in my life for the next few years or so. Luckily, I never developed an addiction, not really (I mean can you develop an addiction to things like that.. dependency maybe, but definitely not an addiction).. I finally sought help for the shit that was going on in my mind, and I stopped self medicating. More or less.. Nothing is wrong with the occasional usage of weed.. right? But anyways, it is almost as though my fear of real life and the consequential hiding of my sexuality had me resorting to any possible way of escape.

Seeing Rue and Jules... Seeing Rue fight her inner demons and mental health... Like, I am empathizing a little too hard with the show, to the point it is almost uncomfortable to watch, heh. The only real difference between Rue and me is she got addicted to hard drugs and is also biracial (an experience I will never be able to personally understand). I am just saying, this show though triggering on so many personal levels, gets me to a point. 

One thing I wish I could tell Rue? Accept yourself. Running away from all the shit that is ""wrong"" with you, doesn't help. Sure, now I am on a cocktail of meds, but they're trying to balance the chemicals in my brain.. and like, I honestly feel so much better. I am going to see a therapist soon, so hope? Who knows, maybe someday I won't need any drugs, prescription or recreational.. But until then, why not do what I can to mellow my brain the fuck out.",08Jul2019,2
20,"I (and my parents at one point) have consulted with more mental health and mental health adjacent providers throughout my life than I can could count on my fingers and toes, and I am currently seeing someone.

I have been repeatedly accused of saying certain things just for a reaction, as well as just being a mindless rebel. I frequently violate basic conversational norms, and can’t seem to get myself to care enough to invest in forming some more socially acceptable habits. The behavior that has made people question the most whether I just want to push people’s buttons is my incredibly dirty sense of humor, and willingness to talk matter-of-factly about taboo topics no matter who is around. I also frequently flaunt basic pleasantries. Sometimes I know I am not doing what is asked of me in a situation, and can think of alternative ways to act, but after thinking hard about this, and discussing it with my current provider, the best I have come up with is that I feel like I am acting, sheepish, and just not myself if I just shut up and act the way people want me to, even if it means simple changes sometimes. 

I could, in theory, so easily just say, “Good, and you?”, when someone asks how I am doing, or spare my company a detailed description of my latest menstrual product usage. But somehow, it just feels too wrong and unnatural to just do what society wants a lot of the time. Could I be somehow addicted to some kind of negative reactions? Not sure where that tendency would come from, since my family tried to shower me with all kinds of affection, wasn’t abusive, and was very involved with me growing up.",08Jul2019,1

22,"So, this summer has been less than ideal. It was supposed to be spent with my boyfriend and my friends, but he broke up with me two weeks before summer started. I had to go through exams on the brink of a breakdown. Coming home, everything came crashing on me at once: finishing my first year of college, an ongoing crisis about my major, planning for my first apartment, getting a new job, adjusting to being back home, and being in the same town as my ex who is the only person I’ve ever loved but who doesn’t love me anymore. It was a lot. To make it worse, the people I thought were our friends haven’t talked to me. They all chose him. I’m no one’s first choice. 

But I was coping. I finally reached out to get help because I knew I couldn’t go on like that. The meds helped, although I was still so incredibly lonely and unhinged. Then I had an awful full body rash, cause disputes and ultimately unknown among my doctors. I was taken off Wellbutrin in case it was to an additive, prescribed a different formula. I haven’t been taking it in case I have an allergy to Wellbutrin (when I start taking it after the rash clears up and it comes back, we’ll know that way). It’s been two weeks since I stopped. 

So I’ve been unmedicated, during the hardest period of time because of everything that was planned with people who no longer care about me. Not to mention I was also prescribed steroids, which have made me gain weigh as a side effect. I feel gross about my body, hopeless about my life, and so, so alone. The past few days, all I’ve done is sleep and lay in bed, although no matter how much rest I get, I feel like a zombie. I’ve never been so horrifically exhausted. If I think too hard about what’s happening, I start to cry. I feel bad about feeling bad, because there’s so many people out there with it worse and whatnot. But damn, my brain and body and the world all seem out to get me and I know telling myself to just get over it is like saying to get over a broken arm because I am battling a mental illness, but I just feel pathetic.

I just want to be okay, but I feel like I have no reason to be. Make no mistake, I’m not suicidal, I just don’t feel like I have anyone who really cares. In my entire life, I’ve never felt so alone, and it doesn’t help that I have major issues talking to people about things.

26,"I've spent the past few weeks in a place I'm all too familiar with. 

There are days where I play scenarios in my head where the friends I've made some wonderful memories with begun to spit words of disgust and contempt for me, causing me to question whether or not they still really want me in their lives. Part of me isn't sure if I should believe these ""daydreams"" or excuse them as nothing more than my own mind trying to play tricks on me. 

Sometimes I feel not much of anything. Unsure of whether to mindlessly go through each of my social media accounts to find someone to bring a spark back to my mind, or to just let the day continue on and allow tomorrow to restart my mind and me be back to myself. 

Even with this, I still am not sure what my ""normal self"" really is anymore. Of course, I still feel joy and happiness. I can laugh with my family, smile from funny images or pictures of small animals. However, there is this nagging feeling that something is wrong with me. How can I feel these things, yet at the same time still find a way to eventually get back to myself? 

I was once given prescriptions, but felt too afraid to take them out of fear of losing myself entirely. To become numb to everything, when I'd much rather feel each low than lose every high. I've considered seeking therapeutic help, but with these coming and going, its difficult for me to voice how I feel with someone after they have all resolved almost entirely on their own. 

I guess, in a way, I'm just hoping it isnt just me that feels this way. Perhaps, in my own way, I'm trying to know that things will be ok for me.",08Jul2019,1

28,"Hey, just wondering has anyone else had a negative experience with a mental health Occupational therapist? I read a thread recently that said this is a made up fluff off a 'profession' and I honestly could not agree any more. 

Here in Ireland,  the mental health service is just appealing, there are waiting lists and psychologists, psychiatrist don't get replaced if they go on maternity leave, you could be waiting for years easily  so you are stuck with basically nobody to talk to.

Anyways I had a mental health occupational 'therapist' who was just awful. I have anxiety and she made me feel even more anxious in her presence. I allowed for there to be a student shadowing her on out initial meet. But the OT just showed off to her... She just repeated my statements in an 'Oh My God manner' about my school situation instead of offering any actual help / resolutions... what a retard!!😡😡😡🙄🙄

So next session came and she asked if the student could come along again, I said I would prefer not. She was fucking waiting out the room expecting to come in!!I just didn't want a repeat of last events, her showing off. 

The OT  was patronising the whole time and have me shitty advice I could get from the internet easily and was strict with the stupid 1 hour session.  She barely said good bye and made me feel so awkward even apologising to the fricken student bot allowing her back in.HELLO YOUR FOCUS SHOULD BE ME...

What made matters worse is I didn't tell the bitch of a psychiatrist as she had previously labelled me as 'perfectionist' but if I had my time back I wouldve  she clearly wasnt a valuable PROFESISIONAL Good OT.

My point to this anyways is how unfair it is the likes of these 'health care professionals' get paid so much when they really aren't remotely involved in healthcare... this OT didn't even offer COUNSELLING/PSYCHOTHERAPY... Yes that's right, they claim to be mental health workers without the vital mental health caring .....sickening! Yet workers who wipe shit of old people's bum get paid less?

I just don't see their need/existence honestly. A quick Google search and you have your OT 'mental health' session given to you by yourself with some corny cliche stupid advice . USELESS professionals",08Jul2019,0
29,"I'm in a bit of a funk and I'm not quite sure how to move forward here, so let's kick things off:

For context: my biological parents divorced when I was 16 years old due to infidelity. In my mind, I blamed myself for what happened, even though it really didn't have anything to do with me. I didn't take action to fix it until I was 20 and well into college, at the advice of my mentors, colleagues, friends, and family. I figured the problem was rectified, at least until today (I'm now 23).

My dad had been in a relationship for a good part of the time between the last marriage ending, and everything seemed pretty happy and healthy. Well, that turned out to be exactly wrong, and they split up today, again because of infidelity. I know that their split is past fixing at this point, as it would be expected to be. I can't fix how things went between them.

Problem is, when I first heard about it, my immediate reaction was to blame myself, like I did last time. I ""know"" what happened is not my fault, and I keep repeating that to try and convince myself otherwise, but the fact of the matter is that I still feel that, on a subconscious level, that this whole thing is happening to me again because of me. I moved back in with my dad, and within a literal week, this shit went south.

Outside of this, the support system I had in place previously has eroded somewhat, or at least it has in my mind. After I graduated with my Bachelor's, I gradually shrunk back away from the vast majority of my friends, colleagues, and mentors. I've stopped using social media almost completely and I've only used my phone for work-related things since graduating, so it probably seems like I vanished to them. I feel like I've failed them because I haven't been nearly as productive or as on top of my work as I was during my studies. I want to reconnect with them, and to know that their friendships with me aren't based on my level of productivity, but this just seems like a super shitty time to do it.


Which leaves me with a few questions:
- How can I reestablish my friendships without the expectation of them owing me their time or help?

- What steps can I take in the immediate moment to move through all of this in a sane and safe way?

- What steps can I take in the future to heal and hopefully not be too hard on myself, particularly when it comes to things that are, ultimately, not my fault?",08Jul2019,1

When I was 8, a day had come where my dad had threatened my mom over the phone so badly that she ended up taking us from the house and leaving him. It’s been about 6 years since then, but I realize that leaving my father at such a young age has emotionally wounded me.

33,"I was in the hospital last week, had to have ECT and start taking a couple new medications and between the two of those my head is so damn fuzzy.  Earlier a friend mentioned another mutual friend of ours and I had absolutely no idea what the hell he was talking about for the longest time.  Not only that but at times I can barely remember who my favorite people are.  The worst one was that my dog had to be put down the other day and I couldn't remember why.  I'd completely forgotten that he had cancer and was completely distraught.  After some time it finally sank in but yeah it wasn't fun.

When I got home from my hospital stay I learned my friends...pretty much my only friends at this point...had kicked me from their Discord server so I could take time to get better.  I've known these people many years but issues were arising due to me being depressed and oversensitive.  I did intensive talk therapy, ECT, started these new meds, etc. but they still don't want me back for a while because they're not convinced I'm ready yet or something like that.  They want me to take time to fall into my new routine and get settled in and such.  So now I have no one to talk to and therefore no one to practice my new coping and people skills with and I can barely even remember half my life at times.  A huge part of my brain is screaming that they don't want me back at all and this is the beginning of the end.  I'm learning to silence those negative thoughts but it's not easy.

I'm trying very hard to stay positive.  I know some of my friends are weirdos who look at my Reddit profile sometimes and I don't want them to read this and go ""oh look she's still depressed so she still can't come back!"" because it's not that, I am working on getting better in a lot of ways.

When it fucks up your brain and personality this much though, and when people still don't even want to be around you so you can't even practice half your skills for getting better...kind of makes you wonder what the point is.",08Jul2019,10

About a year ago I had a panic attack (caffeine withdrawal) and when I was panicking the faces of the people in my family looked unrecognizable, like they were aliens pretending to be my family.

36,"I'm a 24 year old male with aspergers and depression. 

I feel absolutely alone in this world. Yes i do have my parents and sisters who support me and encourage me to do activities and get out, and i know some people, but they are not what you'd call friends.

I have no friends, nor have i ever dated a girl. 

I just don't interact with people, i just use the internet after coming back home from collage. This lifestyle was fine for me until recently, but i recently started using tinder to try and find someone i could connect with personally, and just fell in a rabbit hole.

I also started using facebook and other social media, and started to realize how most people of my age have a social life at this point. I sudenly feel pressure to do something with my life, but i know there's nothing i can do.

People just show aversion towards me. People actively avoid me, pretend like they don't hear me, or straight up act hostile towards me, in a way that infuriates me. I'll greet my neighbours and none of them will respond. Same with most everyone. I feel like i don't even exist.

I cannot start a social life if people fucking hate me and i hate people because of my resentment towards them. I'm antisocial and asocial, but i don't want to be this way.

I'm alone, i don't know if i'm just that deep in the autistic spectrum.

I just feel like a piece of shit because i feel like everyone treats me like a piece of shit.

I hate both myself and everyone around me. I can't smile or be happy for shit. I only get joy from laughing at memes on the internet, and don't even enjoy that that much.

40,"Dear all,

I am a college student. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for the past four years (or longer, idk) and have been in therapy for over one year. My mental illness has made school very difficult for me, as anxiety made it difficult for me to be on campus and depression made it difficult for me to finish school work on time. My school also has a notorious reputation for overworking the students. As a result of all that, my gpa is extremely low (2.66/4.0) and I was almost expelled from my school because of that. Growing up being taught that having a high gpa is a must has led me to despise myself for having a low one. Only recently did I realize where my passion lies (linguistics, as opposed to stem, which is what my family have always wanted me to study). I switched my major at the beginning of my senior year and now I have to delay graduation by one year. I want to go to grad school for linguistics and I feel extremely underprepared for and anxious about the upcoming application process. In order to feel motivated enough and not have a relapse caused by extreme stress, I have decided to make this post and share with you my daily progress and the steps I take to achieve my dreams so that I can hate myself a little less. I also hope this post could serve as an inspiration or motivation for anyone else who is in a similar situation. 

Love,

Yeah, I have to ask this. I've been talking more and more with my spouse lately and I've been learning more and more about myself. I'm learning that I think my mom and upbringing in general may have...emotionally stunted me. I don't really know where to begin, but I guess I'll try. I grew up in I guess a more turbulent household than I thought. I grew up believing abuse could only be pretty much sexual or physical, and emotional abuse was possible, but I only ever got exaggerated examples. Ya know, Lifetime movies n' shit. I never truly realized...that I shut myself off to the degree that I did. Largely because I was never raised to help understand myself. And this lead to me being very poor at articulating myself emotionally. So when I was put on Ritalin at a very young age, I was already not good at articulating myself. And largely my mom and the psychologists elected to put me on it because I was expressing I guess extreme sadness? My mom said I was suicidal, but I don't remember being suicidal, just that I would rather die than go to school anymore. Maybe it was a bit of square peg-ness, but after I got put on the ritalin...I almost felt...worse. I didn't know to just say ""I'd rather feel sad than feel nothing."" 
Another thing I've realized is that...I don't think my mom ever truly got over her divorce to my dad. And as I got older...I started look more and more like my dad. Like...A LOT more...And so I think subconsciously, as I got older, my mom never truly stopped babying me. She never stopped over caring in order to try to make sure I turned out right. And...I always felt patronized. I always felt like I was being talked down to. So it started a vicious cycle. I shut myself off and played video games to cope. When I would go to my dad's house, he actually tried to parent me despite how busy he was, trying to make sure my homework was done and coaching me on whatever sport I was trying. But it felt like whiplash compared to my mom. So once again, I just shut myself off and played video games. A lot of life had just felt like...going through the motions. The ONLY satisfaction I got was wrestling, senior year of high school that was the only time I felt like my life truly had a purpose...then it was gone. So once again, I shut myself off. 
So I mean I have to ask...is a parent treating you like a invalid a form of abuse? I mean if it made me...emotionally cut myself off from the world for upwards of...years. I mean I would say that's the case. I emotionally cut myself off. And it's only recently during my marriage that I've realized to what extent I did. Because looking back at all this, my wife wonders why I'm just not a walking ulcer of stress. Likely...cuz I just learned to turn myself off so well. Fulfill physiological needs, do the bare minimum in pursuing a goal...and then that's it. Otherwise. Just cut myself off. 
I mean I guess it helped me indirectly, by giving me excellent coping mechanisms for when I do open myself up emotionally. But still I reiterate the question of my post. Was I just dead inside? I mean, really. Was I? If this needs more clarity, please let me know, this was for the most part just a stream of consciousness at 2 AM.",08Jul2019,3
42,"I’m really sorry if my writing skills are complete garbage never really been good at writing anything.

Since I remember I’ve always had sleeping problems. I can’t fall asleep unless I’m completely exhausted. I also can’t fall asleep with the lights off. I start seeing things when I’m in a room that’s dark that shouldn’t be there. If I close my eyes and try to go to sleep It feels like I’m in a tunnel with no end. In the tunnel I keep moving forward until and entity of some sort is in front of me and tried to consume me. Then I always open my eyes and try to calm down and relax. It doesn’t matter if my eyes are opened or close when I try to fall asleep. If I have my eyes opened in a dark room. Everything just starts to fade and I see the tunnel again. I’ve been dealing with this for a year and it’s bugging me a lot. I’m always on edge during the night and all the stress and anxiety it’s been giving me is too much. I’ve been having constant headaches and low energy throughout the day. I don’t know what to do. What’s steps do I need to take to fix this.",08Jul2019,1
43,"I’m really hoping that this community will be receptive to this situation, because holy fuck I have no idea what to do.

I’ve had a friend for a long time that’s just an incredible person with a brilliant heart but SEVERELY disabled. I’m fairly certain he’s schizophrenic. But I can’t stress enough how good of a person he is. He buys groceries for the animals that live near his house and he adores nature. He used to be a musician and would play music “for the creatures” outside. He has such a kind and gentle heart for nature, but abhorrently hates humanity. His neighbors cut down a tree next door and he fucking lost it. That was a huge life event for him akin to as if someone murdered your whole family. I don’t know how long ago that happened but it literally haunts him to this day.

He generally hates people if even slightly perceived to be unkind, he generally hates machines (including cars), and he hates human made systems of almost any kind. 

He’s just kind of like a severely disabled hippy, but his ideology has created such a vast and unmoving wall, that its immensely difficult to help him. 

He doesn’t have any family, and of the family he does have, I understand stole money from him. He’s 50-something.  He has a conservator, I think only financially but I have no fucking clue what her responsibilities are to him.  I called her one time because I was worried about him but she was incredibly rude to me. And she refuses to deal with him for more than an hour a month. He likely won’t be able to pay her for much longer, and I think that’s also part of why she just doesn’t care, but I don’t really have the whole picture. 

He’s been beaten and abused by police officers, been in and out of mental institutions, and now has left his home because it’s been threatened to be seized by the city and he can’t bare to stay there anymore. 

He’s living in a motel right now but he won’t be able to afford it much longer and last time I talked to him I cried like I never have before. He’s a beautiful human being with a heart unlike any other, but he is literally tormented day in and out from just being alive. 

Lately he’s been texting me from this motel and every day he loses vast quantities of hope that he didn’t have to begin with. He tells me he has a bleeding ulcer and that he’s had at least one heart attack in the past couple years, so his health is deteriorating too.

So as far as I know, as a friend but incredibly unqualified person to assess the situation, I would say that he needs 

A. Housing assistance
B. The most gentle and caring living assistant(s) you’ve ever seen. 
C. Preferably a way to be in or near nature, but right now he really just needs people that can care about/for him. 

I’m doing the best I can but I’m a near broke 27 year old artist that’s living in his parents’ basement a whole city away. I’m prepared to support him as best I can, but I just don’t have the means, and it’s more complex because he also doesn’t WANT to see me for fear that he’ll find out I’m a shitty human that’s been sent to mock and hurt him. So we text and communicate by phone, but I can’t do much else. 

He can’t be transported because he won’t get in a car if he can help it, but he might if he has somewhere to go that he knows will help him. 
He’s severely traumatized, so I can’t call a mental institution or police to pick him up and take him there or whatever happens. He seems more and more suicidal but not actually in the way that he’ll purposefully kill himself, but more in the way that he just wants to let himself die and hates how long it’s taking. 

I have no fucking clue what to do. Cause I have no idea what kind of institution or company or organization has the resources to help him. I’ve been looking through local support lines, but I honestly don’t really even know what I’m looking for other than like housing assistance or assisted living, or mental health support. 

Finally, we’re located in the US. Colorado, to be specific. He’s more in the Denver-ish area but far enough from downtown that it’s difficult to find something supportive nearby. If anyone knows of something or can help me help my friend, that’d be fucking amazing. Cause I really don’t even know what to do anymore.",08Jul2019,2
44,"All night I’ve been extremely suicidal. like worse than usual, and I was genuinely contemplating if I should today. 
I’ve been listening to music and a song started playing. Suddenly an idea popped in my head. What if I die once this song ends? What if that’s it and there’s nothing left? I started to panic because it became harder and harder to believe that life would go on once the song ended. I could hardly believe that it would. I was ready for everything to go dark. As it ended I even took a deep breath. I was genuinely ready for everything to end and I don’t understand why I thought that or why it happened. It’s over now and I’ve calmed down but i’m genuinely confused.",08Jul2019,1
45,"I'm not really even sure where to begin. I'm 17, this is my first job ever. I should mention that my therapist and the psychiatrist I've had to see both believe I show signs of bipolar disorder among other things as a result of fun horrible trauma. 

In the day leading up to my first day of work my mental state just imploded. For the past three days I've been in a constant state of extreme stress, anger, borderline hallucinations, and severe dissociation. There is no reason I should be this stressed as I've had the job for two days.

I don't want to lose this job, particularly because the girl I love works with me and I don't want to abandon her. But my mind is just so fucked. Today at work I nearly passed out from a lack of eating, drinking anything, and barely any sleep over 2 days. I ended up asking to leave early after debating whether I should just walk out.

This is just so hard for me to do right now. I know it will all be over in a week but I'm seriously afraid of what will happen in the meantime. I'm for sure going to be fired, and again, I don't want to disappoint her. I am about to legitimately die or something though. I can't fucking stay grounded in reality for more than a moment, I just space off into nothing.

I've been screaming at my family, breaking shit, and just being haunted nonstop by the horrendous traumatic childhood I had. All these things I've been hearing that aren't there I know is my father.

Normally when I have these episodes I just get in a jokey mood and become irritable at times. It's never a full blown goddamn psychotic break. I've just begun and already have to work nearly 40 hours this week. I just can't in this state. My body is starved of food and my mind is in a horrible place.

I cant go to the hospital I don't want to disappoint the girl I love. I don't even know if she feels the same but she's everything to me. I can't get fired over my dying mind because then I'll be abandoning her. She's going to think I'm insane and hate me. I love her 

My family is blaming this shit on me like ""oh some people are homeless and you've already got a decent job with a lot of hours"" and ""oh your mom was the one who was hurt the most by your abusive father when you were only six"" 

I can't do this anymore. We don't even have the same shifts anymore, they want me working all night long and she's working in the morning. I *need* her because I love her. 

I want to unironically die but all I've got are pills and ptsd from the last time I tried killing myself with them. Besides, I can't abandon her. What the hell do I do besides die and disappoint her. I fucking love her but I'm going to be insane for a week and screw my life up",08Jul2019,1
46,"I have been taking antidepressants for depression and anxiety for 2 years. They've helped the depression quite a bit, but only took the edge off the anxiety. However I don't feel like they help at all now.

I forgot to take them for about a week and started having withdrawals (this isn't the first time this has happened, but after a couple weeks they've always worked). I've been back on them for 5 weeks and they aren't helping at all. I think it might actually be messing with me more now. I've been having mood swings all over the place and a really difficult time focusing or really just being. I don't feel right or like me at all. The mood swings are different than I'm used to.

50,"About a month ago, I started seeing a social worker for counselling. It is my 4th time seeing professional help, and for once I actually felt that maybe it would be helpful. But perhaps I was wrong. Last week, I shared more about my suicidal ideations, and was made to sign the safety plan (that I knew what to do when I really wanted to commit suicide, etc.). After the session, I sent a message asking if this would be shared with anyone (as I do not want anyone in my family to find out because they are the reason why I even get triggered in the first place). However, I did not receive a reply, and was asked something else instead. This morning, I tried asking again if she had told anyone about my suicidal ideations, and have yet to receive a reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I'm just being paranoid, but why would she not reply me unless she told my family members (or the police) about my suicidal ideations? I'm afraid that she wants to force me to seek help at a hospital, or to get my family members to ensure my safety.

52,"For instance, you can be ADHD, but some people can be more ADHD than others. Is there a specific thing inside you that makes you ADHD or is it just a term we used to describe a group of people that have similar characteristics? If so, if you sit right under the threshold of being considered ADHD, could you say that you are a little bit or a lot ADHD or is that not possible? I'm assuming some illnesses can be classified as either you have it, or you don't. I just find it strange that the distinction is rarely made. I may be wrong, and every mental illness could be on a spectrum from 0-100 but I find it difficult to imagine someone could be just under the threshold of being schizophrenic? We have created countless names for different mental illnesses but is it correct to use such intransigent boxes? I feel like there should be a distinction between Yes/no mental illnesses and slightly/very mental illnesses. This could help to give better cures/support.

Person B is dying from an illness and person A finds out. They remain close friends and eventually end up together. Person B is still ill and eventually, years later, during one of the happiest moments in their lives, person B dies. Generic plot line I know. It was just the raw emotion in their writing that got to me. It felt like it was written by someone who’s gone through something similar (although I really really hope that’s not the case). At the end it shows how person A goes on in life and remarries and has a kid but despite all that person A will never love anyone as much as they loved person B. It sounds quite shit when I try and summarize it like that but that’s not the point. I think it just made me realize, and I mean REALLY realize, how suddenly life can just end. It also made me realize how it will always hurt to lose someone, that maybe eventually you’ll stop thinking about them every second, and then every day, but whenever you do it will rip your heart out. It also made me scared to die. I thought about death before sure but never for this long nor with so much detailed emotion.

I scare myself more sometimes thinking if one day I had a heart attack, how would I know the difference?? The symptoms are so similar. People go to hospital all the time with a suspected heart attack and it’s actually a panic attack so surely it can happen the other way round. 

It’s about 8 hours since but I still have the shakes and feel very nauseous and tired. I’ve ordered a cooling mat and a face pack thing you can put in the freezer. Hopefully this can help me to regulate my temperature at nighttime. I think the night sweats from the menopause are triggering or adding to my panic disorder. 

I have spoken to the doctor and have an appointment, not til 3 weeks time but what can I do! We spoke about other possibilities, vertigo being one. Mum had this and had really bad episodes, mainly down to stress. Many of the symptoms I have are symptoms of vertigo, possibly I have overlooked this and assumed it was down to the menopause or down to my anxiety. 

In other news, I have told B’s head of year at school about them being non-binary now and she is being very good. We are having a meeting later in the week. 

To add to my worries, Bean (one of the kittens) has a lump under the skin on her neck. She has a vets appointment later today, I just pray it’s a fatty lump or something easy to treat.

62,"Hello, 

I’m considering signing up for Better Help, but I’m sort of confused about how it works.

I know you get billed weekly — but do you get billed even if you don’t talk to your counselor that week? If I’m not using the services that week, do I still get charged?

Also — how have your experiences been with BetterHelp? 

Thanks!",08Jul2019,2

The longest I've gone without really doing anything other than binge-watching a TV show is a week. But daily motivation to get out bed is practically absent. Oh, I do get up eventually. Before noon or so. Then go sleep at 2 am. Wake up before noon. Start the cycle. On my awake hours sometimes I just lie down, sit, stare at nothingness, contemplate my miserable life and all the bad things I've done that I can't undo. All the people I've let down. How I ruined my chances of being happy. How I'm so stupid for thinking/feeling some things. You get it, right? Sometimes I get little things done. Laundry. Groceries. Some work. Skincare. Mostly I avoid all the big things I have to do.

But more or less I guess I function? I mean definitely not as well as others. But not as bad as others too? I don't know. Sometimes I doubt if I'm just faking it. I've recently been diagnosed with MDD if that's relevant.",08Jul2019,1

74,"First things first. A lot of my friends are on Reddit and know each others' handles. This is a throwaway because I don't want this linked to my main account, for reasons which will become obvious.

I am a 31 year old male who has lived my entire life with the constant teasing, ridicule and borderline bullying of being overweight. I have always disregarded what others said and had strong fortitude or just plain apathy, don't know which it is anymore. I have tried many times to improve my health but have lost interest shortly after joining a gym, starting running, dieting, whatever I thought at the moment would help me lose some weight.

During my lifetime I have never had someone significant to me or a romantic relationship. I have had the casual hook-up or one off encounter, but never something long term. I have tried many times to get to know people but enough times have I been rejected (some polite and some of them humiliating) that have made me afraid of even attempting to reach out to someone, let alone ask somebody out on a date. Frankly I am terrified of even trying anymore. I have always seen myself as someone who because of his looks did not have a chance to ""get a girl"" and still do. It has been almost ten years since my last encounter and up until recently I have justified it as ""it will get better soon"". I have always downplayed my loneliness and immersed myself in my job and daily clutter, just not to think about it. 

Some time ago I got to meet a very nice girl with whom I clicked instantly. Same interests, very sharp, same hobbies, etc. Felt happy and as if a burden was lifted from my shoulders. The situation made me think that things might really get better, but the coward that I am, never got around at asking her out due to my insecurities and her close friend (our common friend) saying that I stood no chance of approaching her, forget about dating her. That made me feel inept as a human being and miserable for a long time. Never got around to asking her out, even though we are great friends and it kills me inside thinking of the road not taken. She got an exceptional offer for a job and leaves next month for a long term engagement abroad. Still, I told myself that it will get better. 

Last month my last friend to be single got married. I got the wedding invite and that moment hit me like a ton of bricks. At that moment I felt the most lonely I had ever felt in my life, despite being surrounded by friends and family. I just wanted to disappear. I took a long look at my life and took out all the excuses I had made for myself, and I hate, resent myself for where I have ended up. 

It has been a month since, and I feel miserable every single day. Getting up in the morning has become excruciatingly hard. I barely get 2-3 hours of sleep at night, laying in my bed commiserating myself until the early hours of the morning, then getting up and trying to avoid the entire family (have live in parents). I don't feel like speaking to anyone, or they will find out that something is not right. I don't want my mom dragged into this. The happiest ten minutes of the day are when I park my car in the darkest part of the garage and stay there in total silence.

Getting to the office and dealing with tens of people a day has become so draining that I have started to leave the office early. It took me so many years to get here, with a lot of pain and hard work. However, lately I have lost interest, I don't care for it anymore, I don't care if it goes under or whatever happens with it. My job and my career which were (and still are on the outside) my pride and joy, which was the last thing keeping me afloat, I don't care anymore, the slightest bit. And at this point I feel like I am sinking, like I am constantly falling, but never hitting the bottom.

I have lost interest in my job, don't care too much to meet with friends, I become irritated very easily, don't want to speak with anyone, I just want to get to my study and just stay there in total silence. I am at the end of my rope, for the last couple of weeks don't even pretend anymore to be engaged or interested the slightest in social activities and people have started to notice. Keeping up this facade that everything is alright is exhausting, but I don't want people to know.

I live in a relatively conservative place, and talking about these issues creates such a stigma, which becomes even more debilitating and hard to get rid of.

So here I am, feeling sorry for myself, loathing myself, trying to find a way to cope with this and not knowing where or who to turn to, asking strangers for advice. 

I am sorry for the rant and if this seems just like self pity, but I have no one to talk to or even approach with this, in real life, and feel so tired, strained and drained to even try to change my situation. I'm just coasting by, for as long as I can.",08Jul2019,1
75,"I have depression, anxiety, PTSD, and anorexia. I had a job for 3 years despite transferring stores 3 times. I left because I finally had a ""big one"" and went on medical leave for a month, only to be treated very different/unfairly when I returned.

I got a temp job. The temp agency told me I didn't have to do 12 hour shifts. The company asked me to turn in my badge when I refused to stay 4 hours extra. I would have had to come back in 7 hours later, and had a breakdown the day before, so wasn't going to risk my health for a dumb temp job when I'm about to go back to college anyway.

Sometimes I wonder if I really can work. Or how much, or how long. I started a disability application but got denied because I was at the old job and making too much. I wonder if I really can work that much, or if I make myself sick by pushing myself too hard and forcing it.

Now I'm unemployed and just going to go back to school full time. Been dealing with some major brain fog since the temp thing. Wanted to see my case manager, turns out I slept through the appointment and have to wait til Thursday now. I'm getting so forgetful again. Couldn't even function around friends last night.

76,"My sister has asked me to help her deal with her husband's mental health. I'm going to talk to him about it and offer any advice but I don't know where to even start. 

I currently live with my sister, her husband, and their children.

Lately her husband has been extremely moody towards her, me, and his own family and friends. Potentially ruining their friendships. He's supposed to be on medication for depression but he went off it saying ""it just hides the fact that she's (my sister) cheating on me."" 

He's obsessed over thinking my sister cheats on him. Constantly accusing her of talking to men on her phone or even at work. She knows it's a form of mental abuse. She talks about leaving him but she thinks he has a mental illness that causes him to think this way. She does still love him, even after all this. This happens every 2 months. It lasts about a week each time. He has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. He's shown no signs of physical abuse. 

He also talks about wanting to die a lot during these episodes. 

I'm just going to state now that no, those accusations are NOT true.

Now that's out of the way, I need the following advice:


What can I say to him that will maybe think about getting therapy or going to his PCP for a prescription change? 

What mental illness does this even sound like? (His father was the same exact way apparently) 

What can I say to him to help bring him out of this current episode and back to reality? 


I'm posting this for advice. I care about my family. He is my family and I want to help anyway I can. He's a really nice guy when he's not in these episodes. She's hurt and depressed. She wants to help him, not just give up and leave him. That's last resort.",08Jul2019,1

81,"My mother is convinced that our neighbors and people walking past the street, hanging out on the street are talking about/spying/watching us/her and plotting things against us. This has been happening low-key over many years now but I never thought that she might actually be ill. There were situations in which I and my dad/sister believed the things she told us even though I had never heard or seen anything to corroborate her claims. I think I might have even been conditioned to the reality of my mom always having some grievance with regard to our neighbors (some have moved away and been replaced by others and there are new, and all of them are on my mom's list) even though they may actually be completely innocent of her claims. 

She tells us daily, even hourly about how she heard X/Y say this or that and on several occasions she has stepped outside the house and shouted at the people who allegedly said something. 

As of right now I feel her delusions are going out of control. She can't sleep at night, talks about this the whole day and cries and is always thinking about this 24/7.

We even installed a couple CCTV cameras since she wanted to see what was happening/who was hanging around outside the house and now the TV is tuned on to the cctv feed throughout the day and she even has it on her phone.

My mom has been a stay at home mom since she got married and is right now mostly alone at home during the week. I have work and college, my dad has work and we both get home around 6-7pm on weekdays. My sister went abroad recently for her masters. 

There is absolutely no point trying to talk her out of her delusions since I have tried it so many times. My dad simply agrees with her and tries to listen to her but it is just ridiculous at times and we need to somehow help her. 

Would it help to move house and start anew somewhere else? My mom went to Australia to drop my sister off at our aunt's and she reportedly had a blissful three month stay there (where she had lots of company and was taken out to lots of places and introduced to many friends of my aunt compared to back home here where she is super lonely).

I have so much more to tell but I'll stop writing now and post this, hopefully someone provides some insight or asks me something.

83,"Schizoaffective was the first diagnosis.  I have heard voices telling me what others were thinking for years.  I realized at 33 in a moment of clarity that because of this I thought I could read minds.  I knew that was not normal.  I also realized I based my decisions on this ""inside knowledge"" I had.  I sought help and got on medications.  The voices would go away for a while but always came back.  I would end up switching meds and it would work again for a while but eventually I would be back where I started.  

A little background is required here.  I have been through a LOT of traumatic experiences.  Both childhood and adulthood traumas.  

My doctor recently decided that I have severe PTSD instead of schizoaffective.  I have been taken off all my psych meds but remain on anxiety and depression meds.  

The problem comes in that occasionally I still have the voices.  They have escalated to the point they tell me to kill my self, harm myself and recently started repeatedly saying things that indicate I should harm others.  I do not feel I am going to do it but the thoughts/voices are intrusive and affect me deeply.  

I don't know what to do, I am in DBT skills and some of the methods work with the anxiety but not the voices.  And the depression is consuming.

Instead of recognising them as normal little squabbles, he gets incredibly anxious every time we disagree about something - he asks whether I'm going to end the relationship, often ends up in tears and/or hyperventilating, and even had a panic attack last night after he unintentionally upset me. He's a fantastic boyfriend in general - considerate, affectionate, loyal - and I'd like to help him, but I worry that providing him with the constant reassurance he craves isn't doing either of us any favours and isn't sustainable in the long term. He's only had one other relationship (which ended badly) and he's also had some family problems.

He told me he doesn't feel like himself unless he's had a few drinks (he doesn't drink every day, but he definitely drinks a lot more than the recommended weekly allowance). He also said he's been feeling very down lately and that our relationship is the only thing keeping him above water.

91,"Whatever you're generating internally   


Take a moment and examine the following. Notice, how do you know when to begin, whatever it is that you're doing.   
Then notice, the sequence, where you pay attention to one representation at a time, your concious attention shifting from a representation to next representation. Then notice, how do you know, when to end generating the wacky activity.   


The sequence, where you pay attention to one representation at a time - the representaiton can be visuals, feelings, sounds, tastes and smells. These can be external or internal. These can be remembered or imagined.   


For each representation pay specific attention to it's size, rather than the content within it. The representation interms of its size is what even allows you to notice the content. So dose the sequence, of which the representation is part. For voices pay particular attention to location and tonality of the voice. For feelings, pay particular attention to location in the body the feeling begins in, and the next location the feeling moves to, and the next location ... For visuals, pay particular attention to size and distance of image, brightness of it, it's shape if it's not an all around image.   


This sequence is how you acomplish whatever it is you're internaly generating.   


P.S. - For those of you, who some times get confused, and are unable to sort what's real and what's imagined, you must examine how you seperate out - what is real, and what is imagined in your experiance.

She starts asking me questions about him and I try my best to laugh them off and answer in a very calm way. I started to shake and my heart was pounding and I felt like I was going to be sick and I kept blacking out. I had to wait in the car in the parking lot and it started getting worse and worse.

My friend gets back and kept telling me to get over myself and asking me “What the fuck is wrong with you? It’s really not a big deal.” I had to cover my eyes for the entire drive back and tried to not sob as her questions get more and more irritated in tone. I got back home and hyperventilated. I was so embarrassed.

Later that night I felt like my skin was crawling. It was just me home but I could smell sex and semen and I could taste sweat. I started to feel sick again. I stumble to the shower and try to just clean myself off but it wouldn’t go away. I had to turn off the water from my head pounding and fell to my knees to cry and I started throwing up. All I wanted was to stand back up but I felt so helpless and just kept saying “Please stop.” I felt like I couldn’t breathe. 

Here’s some background. Last June, after hiding it my entire life, I came out as a lesbian. I’ve been in straight relationships my whole life. One of them being physically abusive. I would always say yes to sex because I knew if I said no that they would get angry and tell people. So I’d just let it happen and tried to play along the best I could and would always end up going home and sobbing. Feeling worthless and disgusted with myself. Feeling like I wanted to tear my skin off. I knew it wasn’t rape because I said yes, but why did I hate it so much and why does it make me feel so bad? This started when I was around 12. 

Since I came out in June as gay, I had to brake up with said ex who was living with me. He was your typical 17 year old boy. He came to live with me back in October because his parents are really irresponsible and he didn’t want to keep cleaning up after their mistakes. It really started to wear down on me. I hated staying at his house because it would make me feel so afraid. Like I had no control and no where to hide. I was always so relieved to be able to come back home to my own room. But when he moved in, I didn’t have my own space anymore. His mood would constantly shift and I would do everything I could to keep him happy so I wouldn’t have to feel so afraid of him. I would always cook for him and clean and fold his laundry, take care of the moldy milk he’d leave in my room. I could hardly sleep at night from the mix of him being nocturnal and always playing something really loud on subwoofer speakers or waking up from the anxiety that he might try to do something to me in my sleep like others have in the past. But I thought I was happy. 

Eventually my body started to freak out from the stress. My skin would just fall off in patches and bleed and it would be too painful to wear clothes. My joints would hurt for no reason and I’d basically be bed ridden. Which made me feel even more uneasy. I had to lay next him him helpless with hardly any clothes on. I was always so confused why I felt this way about someone who I know is supposed to care about me and I care a lot about too. I really hated moving his phone out of the way and seeing the flirty notifications from other girls he was getting. I would get jealous, but not in the way I was supposed to be. I would feel even more guilty. There was a point where he made me feel too guilty to go hang out with my friends and I was isolated in my room. My safe place has always been outside gardening or finding bugs, but since I was in so much pain I felt trapped in my room. I hated myself for letting this happen to me. And that if I told him something was wrong he’d shrug it off and tell me that he’s the only one that listens to me unlike the rest of my friends who secretly hate me. 

I just kept feeding lower and lower.

Now even though he’s gone and I haven’t spoken to him since we broke up, if I stay over at someone’s house and they fall asleep with the T.V on, I have horrible nightmares and wake up not being able to breathe. I remember he would play a really loud movie really late at night and wake me up to have sex so my family wouldn’t hear it and when we were done, I’d always have to go and cry in the shower for how gross I felt. I get that feeling every time I hear a T.V on when I wake up. 

I just have so much shame and I know it’s all my fault. My friends want me to start to try to find a girlfriend and start things fresh in a more living environment and live my authentic life. But I still have so much fear inside of me. I’m trying so hard to grow and let go, but it won’t leave me alone.

95,"I don't currently work due to some unresolved mental health issues (mostly psychotic symptoms of bipolar disorder). My husband is the ""bread winner"" so to speak. I promised I would do my best to keep the house clean, do all the laundry, grocery shopping, etc, but over the last year I've gotten slack about it. My husband doesn't really care about a clean house, so he barely notices if I let the house get messy. He constantly tells me I'm not worthless, but I feel worthless. I don't know why I can't just get up and work. I literally lie in bed or at my computer chair all day, mostly here on Reddit. I keep making promises to myself, like I'll exercise, and do housecleaning an hour a day (or however long it'll take to clean a room, we live in a small house, so it shouldn't take long). The only thing I'm good about is doing laundry every week, and while I sometimes let the dishes pile up, for the most part I'm good about taking care of them. I can't explain it. It feels like I just can't. Every job I've had I was in danger of being fired because, again, it feels like I just can't.

I have gained 40 lbs in two years, and feel like my body is disgusting. I have stretch marks that make it look like I was pregnant. They are deep and red. The first time my husband saw them, he thought I had cut myself (I have a history, but I haven't in years). When I explained what they were, he felt terrible for pointing it out. I have torn a tendon twice just by doing normal things, like taking out the trash. To be fair, it was stuff we were throwing out, and the bags had to be 30-40 lbs. Still, not something I should have torn a back tendon over. I sprained my ankle just from running barefoot for about half an hour playing wall ball with someone while I was hospitalized (for suicidal ideations).

The problem isn't just my body. I haven't done anything mentally stimulating for a long time. When I was hospitalized I picked up Sudoku, but I just kind of quit that. I plan on picking it back up. I used to have a great vocabulary, but now it's like I'm losing words. I often can't think of the right word. Instead of giving up, I'm trying to get through the mental fog to think harder and not let all my knowledge dissipate. 

Basically I feel like I'm losing myself to the depression side of bipolar disorder. I took a bath yesterday, and that felt like an accomplishment. I just need to figure out how to better myself, but it's hard. My husband doesn't deserve someone who is on her way to becoming obese and does nothing productive. He is my only source of happiness, and that's not fair to him either.",08Jul2019,1

every so often i think ill be ok for a little while and then suddenly i sink even lower than i was before.
right now im just so genuenly sad and lost that i don't even know what to do.
i miss my friends and i wish i was a better person, and that i didn't waste all this time doing nothing.

im convinced there is something wrong with me, for some reason il considered weird and when in social situations i often completely go blank. 
i feel so alone i just want to cry, ive tried so hard to just be a normal person and i just keep on failing. im excerzising, i recently ran a marathon, im buying clothes im comfortable in, im cleaning my room, cooking dinner, and im still just as sad if not even sadder than i was before.
im socially akward because i overthink everything and i can't just let go and be happy.

 my social anxiety is destroying my relationship with people who are actually competent in their life, so im getting surrounded by people that can't help me.

97,"**Philophobia** isn't social **anxiety** disorder, although people with **philophobia** may also have social **anxiety** disorder. Social **anxiety** disorder causes extreme fear in social situations, but it's different from **philophobia** because it encompasses a number of social contexts.

how it happened,how it has affected me and how I deal with it (spoilers,I don’t),now I believe this phobia triggered after my first ever relationship ended,I was 14 years old,at first it didn’t really affect me that much,sure I was upset and depressed about it but I didn’t develop an instant phobia,at least I think,maybe the phobia gradually increased as the months went by…I got teased a lot by my classmates,telling me that its all my fault,saying that I was a bad boyfriend and she didn’t see me anything more than a timepass,and things like that…so I think that if the teasing wasn’t that started the phobia then that was certainly the catalyst to the growth of my phobia,and no I don’t hate them for doing what they did,we were all dumb young teenagers…sure they could have thought about how it might affect me, but most teens don’t really think that much when they have the sudden urge to say or do something ,especially when they are around their friends .So no, I don’t hate them or anything,Shit just happens,we just gotta move on…now after my phobia had taken control…which took a few months to happen I guess…my “love life” has become non-existent ,as well as my sexual life which is tied to my love life…is sexual life tied to love life? Idk ,anyway because of my phobia I legit cant even look at a girl let alone speak to one,and whenever that rare moment happens when I start catching some feeling for a girl,my anxiety starts throwing a party inside me,the feeling of liking someone and then trying your damn best to delete your feelings and forget about the existence of that someone...is horrible…and after i've done it,after I got defeated by philophobia like the 3 other times…I feel empty again,its so hard for me to even find someone to like and then having to instantly dislike that someone…it makes me feel…dead.Now as to how I cope with I..as I told you before..i don’t.i just cant,it has already consumed me.Now you could tell to go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist but..there are no professional psychologists in my country and the few psychiatrists that this country has...well you could compare them to the 1950’s psychiatrists that lived in the USA,because mental health is a very new concept in my country.

The reason I wrote is because I wanted to let it out of my chest, so that you guys know that you are not the only ones suffering from this issue,and im surprised that this issue hasn’t ever been brought up before,not as much as im covering it right now anyway,and also so that other people who are not struggling with this issue know that people like us exist ,so if you know someone you care about who you think might have this issue then try talking to them about it,im not sure if they’ll open up but it’s a good starting point,they will at least know that you know about it and that you gave a shit,and knowing that will make their day much better,even if they don’t show it to you,trust me…..i’d know.

I even got sent to the hospital because my suicidal thoughts got worse. I slept at the hospital overnight and in the morning I spoke to a mental health team. my parents even refused to pick me up from the hospital even though the nurses called them a bunch of times (they didn’t even come with me to the hospital) but eventually they did pick me up. my dad kept yelling at me in the parking lot and refused to let me get into the car and when I started crying he started telling me to stop causing a scene (my mum didn’t do anything to help me, she just stood there). Eventually, when my dad did let me in, both of my parents started yelling at me on the way home (even though the psychiatric told my dad not to say anything to me or a have a debate in the car) they started yelling at me (again) and saying I’m doing all this to humiliate them and they are ashamed of me and blamed it on me being lazy, doing this all for attention and to get out of school and mostly blamed on the internet.

they even switched the wifi off to somehow “cure” me and when I told my parents that I talked to a professional they said that I’m a fool for trusting strangers instead of them (they don’t believe in mental health or professionals as you could probably tell). they even said that if I like the hospital that much then I should stay there forever and never come back home. my dad refuses to talk to me and my mum just like mocks me and tells me that I’m overreacting and causing drama. also, today while I was home alone a social worker stopped by our house not knowing my parents weren’t home. later when my parents found out about it (my brother told them), they started yelling at me (once again) and they said that they’ll file a complain about the social worker because she entered our house without their permission and today while I was on my bed, my mum came into my room and just randomly said that she hated me and wished I was never born.

The only way I can describe our relationship now, when we do talk every few years, is toxic. There's so many emotions and unresolved issues that we can't be friends or romantic probably ever again, and even though making a conscious effort to ""move on"" it's moments when I'm at my worst that I miss her the most, which only makes me feel worse, because... well, we don't talk and what I long for won't happen and I just wish, I'd forget about her, but I can't.

I *might* have depression (probably since I was 10 years old) but I still doubt it. I did search it before and apparently people do doubt it - like they think they are emulating it. And now I think that I'm emulating it, or maybe I'm just faking it all just to show.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like everything I think about is controlled by myself because it's just to show people and for attention and it's really confusing. I also definitely do have another one which I won't really mention since I don't feel comfortable with. I wouldn't want to tell anyone about any of these since I have trust issues that I literally cannot find the cause for since there's so much.

I turn back visibly distraught and see nothing there, despite knowing it's not real but I still do - as if I don't know it's not there. I don't think I'm structuring this very well, sorry.

Anyway I get scared, think I'm hallucinating. I then get called psychotic because I think humans are stupid which is true, and I start to believe it but since I'm scared and again I can't trust them, I search it and find ""Psychosis"" which isn't exactly related, realise I have some symptoms and then I start thinking I might have it. Straight after it's like I notice this is all supposed to be to show people and for attention, so I'm faking it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think there's a lot of stuff wrong with me and I'm filled with problems, or I could be faking it all just to show others and put it in display. So much parts of my thoughts are kind of controlled. I don't know what it is and most of the stuff I thought about I typed. I know I don't make sense but neither do what I think.

I am not a weak person I am very passionate and assertive otherwise. But for some reason the idea is appealing to me.

I literally fantasize about it TO FALL ASLEEP.

I also don’t feel like I deserve to be abused. It’s really just a thing that brings me a certain type of pleasure. Like when u get butterflies in your stomach.

I seek men that I know are at high risk to be violent.

I don’t believe in male superiority or anything and I don’t feel like I can be easily manipulated or controlled.

My partner and I have been dating for a few months now and everything has gone well, our chemistry is solid, we know how to communicate our thoughts and feelings and we mutually have stated we love each other. Before we met we both had big life changes. I had recently moved out of my parents who I did not have a healthy relationship with, and he had recently had gotten out of a long-term relationship with someone he no longer saw a future with. Well, it so happens that we were both planning on moving to the Northwest Region when we were first talking, so if we were to date that wouldn't be an issue... except we are planning to move 4 months apart from each other. Flash forward to now, I have severe anxiety and PTSD and my partner has similar issues plus being Bipolar, and we are both having an mental dip that could last awhile. He moves in October which gives us roughly 4 months to continue developing our relationship, while working multiple jobs and still attempting to have social lives outside of each other, and also battling our personal demons with professional help. If the tone that has been going on continues to be negative however, not towards the relationship but life overall, and with the 4 month gap that we need to be ready for... does it seem HEALTHY to keep things going? I care about him and I willing to work through it and see what happens. He cares about me and has expressed similar thoughts. I just want to make sure I am making the right life choices and that we are doing what is best for the both of us.

A little preface to why I’m even considering this despite that any other job would give me oodles more money and insurance (depending on the company) vs. the freelance route. So basically (if you're down for story time) I’ve had a really bad run in with mental health (more prominent THIS year than any before) so it’s been ROUGH to say the least. I seriously won’t go into detail unless asked, but personally the thought of going into an actual work force might just drive me insane (plus I don’t want any more track records of being hospitalized while being employed honestly either). SO I finally thought about maybe taking it slow for a while and trying to get a little foothold into selling my own art. Whether I decide to get a part-time job down the road and still do art or not, I do have time to learn. Plus all I do is make art anyways. Why not find what the masses want and sell products??

I’m writing to you guys today to express the fact that accepting you don’t feel comfortable with the position you are in is alright.

I’ve accepted that I put myself in this position, but let me explain why I got to this position. I’ve dealt with really bad anxiety my whole life. I thought I had ADD because the only things I could focus on was what I wanted to do. Not GEs or anything along those lines. So I went to a therapist and they told me that I needed to go to a psychiatrist and maybe think about trying an SSRI. I was scared because of what I’ve seen on the internet about those types of drugs but I gave it a shot. My psychiatrist told me it was probably anxiety and not ADD because of the symptoms I was having. I never really related the two until he told me about it. Ive been on the drug for a few months now and I have improved noticeably. I’m not advocating for drugs with this post. I’m advocating for you to want to have change in your life.

121,"I'm going to kill myself. That sounds really edgy but it's my only option at this point.

I'm 17 and I've had depression and anxiety for 5 years, following my mothers psychotic episode which caused her and I to run away to a town we didn't know in the belief that my step father was going to kill us. Additionally, she was severely emotionally abusive towards both myself and my father which led to his suicide in 2003. Now, I've been in counselling for the majority of the 5 years and I know that things can improve, but at the end of the day I'll just get bad again. 

I was recently admitted to my districts youth psych ward twice, which only resulted in medication which has not helped me at all. I get violent intrusive thoughts and at times i'm elated and horrifically impulsive which scares me because what if i get intrusive thoughts whilst impulsive? I don't wanna hurt anyone, and i'm so damn scared that i will. I get delusions and hallucinations which i cannot control, voices telling me to do stuff I really don't want to do, and i'm fairly certain i'm possessed by at least two spirits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, i'm fucked and i'm tired of fighting. Often when i was young, i would repeat 'live because he couldn't' over and over when I felt like this but it's not working. 

I really need help. Sorry.",08Jul2019,7
122,"I was promoted to case manager in my program 3 months ago. I've been with this program and non profit for almost a year. I have finally accepted the fact that I HATE this job. I am more miserable than usual and really want to quit. I just feel guilty about leaving my program supervisor doing two jobs while they search for my replacement. I would like to at least train in new staff before leaving, but I feel like a failure leaving after only 3 months. 

Also, I want to go into a new field entirely. I have a BS in psychology and I haven't found a job that I think I would enjoy. I think I need a field where I don't have to work with people directly, but I have no ideas on that front. I love film and have been interested in it, but I don't know how I would just jump in. 

But my main concern is money. I have some saved up, but I'll need to get a simple job elsewhere soon after quitting. And I think that would just add to my feelings of failure and disappointment. Really my problem is that I am more lost than I ever have been before.",08Jul2019,8
123,"So I've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. Recently though I've started noticing a lot of weird symptoms, for example, last night I felt my heart beating really fast, for no reason, I didn't feel anxious or anything and my heart rate went back to normal after a few dozen seconds from me noticing. Also, I've been really hyperactive, I constantly have to be moving one way or another, usually moving my legs around. I've always done this but it's a lot more now. Overall I have a ton of energy (and no motivation) which makes it hard to sleep or get things done as I can't focus and my mind won't calm down. I think it could have to do with my social anxiety (i think about it constantly, constantly comparing how I react to stuff even when I'm alone to how others would, i can only think clearly if i pretend i'm talking to someone else because it allows me to make up lies in my head about myself). Is this social anxiety/depression? Everything I just described is new. I read something about thyroid issues, maybe that's it? I'm 16 and male, btw",08Jul2019,3

125,"My sister threatened to kill herself early this morning. Her husband took her to the ER and they have her on suicide watch. She has been there about 12 hours.   We haven’t been able to speak to her or a doctor and have no idea when we can see her. The nurse told us that she has been seen by a psychiatrist and that they are working on finding a placement for her at a psychiatric facility but there is limited availability. I have asked if they will release her to me to take her to  where I live, which is a big city about 4 hours away (we are currently in a rural town in the South ). The nurse said no. I asked if they will release her after 72 hours because it was my understanding that they could only keep her for 72 hours without a court order, and the nurse basically told me that told once she is placed at a facility THEN she will be evaluated and held for either 24 hours or 72 hours and if they feel that she is still a danger to herself they will seek a court order for longer, but basically the 24-72 hours count starts when she gets to a psychiatric facility and not while she is in the ER.  The n the meantime we have no idea how she is doing or anything. 


My questions are for anyone who has been in this situation or who has a family member who has been in this situation, what should I be doing right now?  I left work and came to her town to see her but they are saying it could be days before she even gets placed in a facility, and even then I won’t get to see her for 24 hours or longer. I have no idea if that’s even legal—can they keep her from seeing her family?  I understand that she needs help but the thought of my little sister in a hospital for so long without anyone who loves her there is breaking my heart.

128,"Not sure if #8 of the FAQ answers this, but I'll try anyway.

I'm a 19 year old college student in the US and I need therapy but it seems like every way I try to get it, something gets in the way. I've been having some real deep issues for a while, so at the end of spring semester my friend recommended campus counseling to start the process.

I went in for an appointment, and because it was within the last month of the semester, the woman I was assigned to could only see me twice (appointments are 3 weeks apart). She also was moving on from the university and by now is at another organization. To add on to that, the counseling at school is short term. It's for things like consultation, test anxiety or adjustment issues, and my counselor recommended ""serious long-term therapy"" for me. She gave me some resources but I lost them in the move back home. Even if I had them I couldn't do anything with them because of my main obstacles:

* My mother pays for the insurance, which she gets through her job. More than likely she will see the bill and ask why therapy is on the list.
* I don't want her to know because in the past when I've tried to talk to her about some of my concerns she brushed them off as something everyone goes through. It's likely she'll make me stop. And among the list of things I need help with is my experience with CSA. I absolutely cannot tell her that happened to me.
* She won't tell me what insurance plan we have for god knows why, so I can't figure out who would accept my insurance, whether she'd have to pay anything out of pocket, or if I can ask the insurance company to not show my therapy on the bill.
I need therapy. Bad. I feel like my problems are getting worse and don't know where else to go. I can explain whatever you need further and any help is appreciated.

TL;DR I'm 19 and in college. I need to get serious, long-term therapy without my parent knowing but can't get the information I need to do so.",08Jul2019,1

130,"Now, I’d like to preface this post by saying I’m a 13 year old boy and this might just be hormones but I don’t know. I have weird compulsions and I think I do things that normal people don’t do, for example, I’ll move my fingers across my eyebrows repeatedly to make sure they’re sat right, and if I don’t I get like, anxious? guilty? I can’t describe the feeling but it’s one in my gut. I’ll also push on my door repeatedly to make sure it closed (when it obviously is) but it’s like my brain needs to make sure. If I have to go to the bathroom before I shower I use the bathroom and I don’t just remove my clothes I button my pants and all that and then I’ll take them off to shower, if I don’t I get that gut feeling. I also repeatedly feel a need to rub my hands across my forearms. I’m also not depressed or at least I don’t think but I beat myself up for it but I can’t stop and I don’t know why. I also constantly have numbers running through my head. I’ll count my steps, how many times I’ve chewed, when I’m sitting down I count how many times I bounce my leg, when I’m trying to sleep I count my breaths and it’s exhausting. I want to join the military when I’m older (marines) I’m built for it physically because as I said I’m 13 and around 5’8 1/2 and like 167 pounds of skinny muscle but a lot of thigh fat but my doc said that’s because it’s building it to grow, because it’s like the fattiest part of me. Will this interfere with the MEPS (mental health tests) if it does I won’t bring it up to my dad because then i might get diagnosed with something and I don’t want to be not allowed to join. Sorry for the weird flex about height and weight. One more thing, I am very calm and cool and I rarely if ever fly off the handle and I’m not very emotional but I can’t control myself when it comes to these things. One more thing for real this time, also could this be interfering with my “romantic” (girls and crushes) relationship (friends and family) life even though I’m 13 but I’m curious, because I’m nice to everyone at school (I’m not trying to be a nice guy) but I’m nice to my crush and such but they see me do certain things in public and they look at me funny and they don’t really talk to me because of it. Welp I keep thinking of things so after this one I’ll stop but when I play games like dark souls and skyrim and such I have to constantly check if I’m wearing the right equipment. I can’t just see it, I have to say it aloud multiple times for my brain to be satisfied. Ok I’m done now

131,So at the moment my life has basically gone to shit. I’m currently 14 and in year 10 but I’m soon going to be in year 11 and the problem is i’m lonely and I feel depressed due to that. The thing is that I don’t have many friends and the ones I do I don’t see often due to the fact they both don’t go to my school and one basically lives in the middle of nowhere while I don’t have the others phone number so I only get to see them once a week at after school clubs. The people at school are either assholes or people who forget I even exist and I’m kinda shy so I only talk to people I know well. During break time and lunch I had to just walk around the school on my own due to the fact I have no one to hang around with and we aren’t allowed are phones in school. Another thing is that I don’t really share my interests with other people due to the fact that I’m scared their going to judge me and make fun of me and sure there are people in my school who share the same interests as me but they barely even i care about me even if I try to hang out with them. The thing is that summer is rapidly approaching and I don’t want to spend it being alone in my room just playing video games and watching YouTube as much as I enjoy them the fact that I’m alone haunts my brain. I always wonder that if I would ever die would anyone actually care for more than an hour before getting on with their lives. I’m not trying to get people to feel bad for me I just want help.,08Jul2019,6
132,"Hello, friends. I’m having a tough go of things. Back in April I was working a terrible job that just had me constantly breaking down. I mean every single shift I was in the bathroom having major anxiety attacks. One day was so bad that my boyfriend encouraged me to leave right then and there. It was incredibly difficult as I’ve never done anything like that and I was scared. But I did it, I quit and he came and picked me up. On the way home, he told me I can take as much time as I need before looking for a new job, whether it be a week or a year. Because I’ve had a string of terrible jobs that caused my mental health to plummet severely over the past and he’d rather me be okay than anything else. 

Having a break was starting to help me feel semi-okay again. Until the guilt set in. Now, he has a good full-time job where he gets overtime every week. He reassured me a million times that he makes enough to support us and our son (cat). But... the guilt won’t subside. He gets stressed sometimes, like today, and I spiral. I know I’m not healthy enough yet to sustain a job and my mental health at the same time, but it pains me to see him bear it all alone. He says I do other things that are essential for him like support him emotionally and make his food, do the laundry, clean the room, etc. but my brain just tells me that it’s inconsequential compared to what he does to support us. Even when he tells me he likes to be the provider and likes knowing we can depend on him, all I feel is guilt and shame. 

Especially living in his mother’s house (who hates me and judges me constantly). For instance: This past week he didn’t get the paycheck he was expecting so he offered his mom $130-ish this week and she said no, she wants $200. And she keeps hounding him and it’s stressing him so badly. There’s nothing I can do and I had a breakdown about it this morning, telling him how awful I feel when he’s waiting for his meeting to start for his 11-hour shift and he asks me what I’m doing, all I have to say is “about to watch ____!” And it makes me feel gross. But he reassured me again that I need to put my mental health first right now because that’s all he cares about and we’ll be okay. But part of me feels like he’s just saying that so I don’t go to dark places, if you know what I mean. Also, side note it gets confusing sometimes bc he’ll “joke” about certain places that are hiring and when he sees me looking panicked, he’ll say that it’s for “in the future” and he’s not pressuring me but maybe it’s his way of saying I need to hurry up and get better. 

TLDR; my boyfriend keeps reassuring me that it’s okay that I’m still out of work until my mental health gets better but the guilt and shame is eating me alive.",08Jul2019,1
133,"     Hi I know you guys aren't professionals, but I just need some guidance or advice and/or input. Again, I'm not seeking medical advice. In 2012 after a very traumatizing childhood, poor self-esteem, being diagnosed with depression I experienced a horrific situation. At the time I was in high school I was in highschool, and I was being bullied and hazed by other students.

     Well keep in mind I was dealing with hormonal imbalances that led to rapid severe mood swings. Weeks before my period I would begin to experience severe depression, crying for no reason at all, a dark cloud would descend over my life. This included breast tenderness, itching, suicidal thoughts, and more then after my period was over I would level out again. So about six months after the hazing incident I began to display symptoms of what I am now diagnosed with which is PTSD. However, I feel like much more is going on.

     I developed severe anxiety, low stress tolerance, was unable to leave the house, unable to attend college out of fear and there being too many people, just all around social phobia and not wanting to deal with people. I was able to break out of it somewhat, and started college and started working. Here's where things get even lower for me. I still experience everything said above, but I now have other things I am not completely understanding happen as well.

Symptoms/Observations:

VERY low stress tolerance, it can be something so small and not worth stressing about I will stress to the point of tears. Having to go cash my check instead of receiving direct deposit, an email from a college professor, having to go inside an office to sign up for anything. Anything outside of my expected routine throws me off track. Any small thing can set me off and lead to me stressing over a situation.

     Next inability to fully experience my emotions. I can still feel I'm human of course, but it's almost as if all of my feelings are background music. I'm excited, but don't full feel the full experience of being excited or any other of my emotions. In some cases there is a lack of emotion that almost scares me. Of course I know how I feel, but it's so dull to the point where I have become extremely concerned.

    I can't keep a job, my low stress tolerance gets in the way. It's not even the social aspect, I became drained from talking to people everyday at my last job and dealing with their problems. There is so much more I want to add, but maybe I'll make another post, or edit this one.",08Jul2019,1
134,"this is a serious post incase any mods think its not...

so 6 days I got banned on r/memes for posting corn (I thought it was a thing but it was considered spam). anyway I was okay with it for 6 days and I sort of agreed with mods on banning me even though I thought it was a bit much to permanently ban without a warning even. anyway after 6 days I asked to get unbanned in the stupidest way. I said I wanted to write a comment. now I realize it was stupid. anyway because of that I got muted from sending messages for 72 hours.

why I'm posting this here is cause of how it affected me. after getting muted I felt betrayed and unimportant cause even though its just a stupid subreddit its something I enjoyed and it was so nice to just be ""active"" in it. it made me happy and I feel horrible cause I feel like I failed this ""group"". it hurts to the point of crying and I dont know why. I know this is so stupid but these last 6 days were a rollercoaster of emotions. of feeling belittled to angry to anxious. I take everything so harshly and in a very personal way. my habbits online are terrible. things get to me so easily and maybe I'm just not mentally ready to be online (I have diagnosed social anxiety so I really enjoy being online because it's much easier talking with people who are like... not people sort of. anyway just wanted to vent and say I feel like shit for dumb reasons and I wish it would stop affecting me so much",08Jul2019,1
135,"Anybody have any tips and tricks for getting out of “moods”? Triggers are always something entirely menial, could be a perceived tone of voice from someone, or nothing at all.

I end up severely pissed off, passive aggressive, refusing to talk much (there’s never any reasonable situational reason so there’s little to say), pain in the fucking arse to deal with. Results in me keeping myself to myself because who wants to deal with this on a regular basis. Can’t see my current relationship working because of this, nor family relationships or friendships, daily desires to cut them off.

Shouldn’t complain since I don’t help myself (slight self-imposed isolation, decade of weed smoking, variable sleep pattern, diet’s gone downhill a little), although if I do help myself it doesn’t make a difference. Shouldn’t complain but the shame of the public and people having to deal with this means I have to ask.

I lost my job and every day is just a waste. I feel so unmotivated and lacking energy, I need to get back to work but the thought of getting another job makes me feel sick. I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm really fucking tired of all of this.",08Jul2019,1
137,"So, I think this is just going to be a bit of a vent post. I don't exactly have anywhere else to put it. Warning that I might start to talk about topics that could potentially be quite triggering. I also swear quite a bit though I don't know how much of that I'll include in the post. This is also going to be *very* long.

For as long as I can remember, I've been struggling with issues that up until a little while ago I'd grown to accept as a part of my life that I couldn't change and didn't need to. I thought everybody had to deal with the same things as me and I was being stupid. My parents would never pay attention whenever I talked about those things, or would listen and then dismiss it as me being either dramatic and exaggerating or just plain attention seeking. I'm a minor, so I still live with them, and even now they don't listen to things I say very often.

I think, because of being told I was attention seeking, I still think I am. I don't like typing this out because there's a voice in my head that's telling me, 'You're just a dumb kid who doesn't understand real issues, and you're doing this because you want validation', but my friends care about me a lot and think there might be something wrong. So, I'm posting this.

Sometimes, I feel unhappy. And that doesn't go away for a very long time. But it's not really unhappy. I don't know what it is. You know when you eat a popsicle, but it's so cold it feels hot in your mouth? It's kind of like that. This overwhelming sadness that is so strong it feels like... Nothing, I guess. Because I don't feel sad but there's no other emotion to describe it. I feel absolutely nothing and that feels like it's because I'm sad. It's almost impossible to explain. 

Anyway, it happens a lot. One day I'll be perfectly fine, and happy, and the next I won't want to get out of bed because I feel like crying but I just can't. And everything feels so hopeless. Like I'm never going to get anywhere, and everything I try is pointless anyway, and I'm going to fail in every class and wouldn't it be so much better if I was dead.

Sometimes, it's because of things that happen. Something the day before might have made me feel, for example, really guilty, and I'll start to hate myself for doing whatever I did, and I feel so fucking useless again and it happens. Sometimes it just appears out of nowhere. I'll wake up and feel like that. And won't stop feeling like that for weeks.

And then there's the other issue. The issue that makes it impossible for me to get to sleep because I can't stop thinking about things I did, things I do, things i WILL do, and it makes my skin crawl. The issue that bugs me with constant 'What if, what if, what if's and makes me unable to focus on anything. 

I didn't think, at first, that it was anxiety. I'm still unsure if it is. All I know is that several times over the past few years I have gotten so worried, so stressed, where it builds and builds and I don't know where it tips over the edge because one moment I'll be getting increasingly more stressed and the next I'll be crying on the floor and unable to breathe. The therapist I'm seeing told me that it's called an anxiety attack.

It's honestly a bit of a miracle I'm even seeing a therapist. I begged and pleaded my mum for months, because I needed someone to talk to that wouldn't shut me down 90% of the time, and she finally listened to me after years of not doing anything. I know I'm making my parents seem awful and dense, but the reality is, I think they just didn't know how to handle all of the things I told them and didn't *want* to believe me. But my mum loves me despite everything, and she finally listened and got me someone to talk to.

But everything that my therapist says is so overwhelming. She says the same things as my friends, telling me she thinks I have *depression* and *anxiety* and I don't know how to deal with that. Especially because I keep feeling like I'm faking it, and she only thinks that because I'm telling her false things about how I feel. Even though I've only told the truth.

Here's the real problem, though. I don't know if I have those things at all. My parents think there's nothing wrong with me and don't want me to get any kind of diagnosis, and I still doubt everything that happens. I just want to know for sure whether I have these issues or if I'm overreacting and they're normal. 

Advice and opinions on what I've said would help a lot. I know I'm just a kid, and maybe a lot of what I've described aren't serious mental health problems, but I really need some thoughts from other people. I definitely think *something's* wrong with me, I'm just very unsure of how serious that actually is. Thank you so much :)",08Jul2019,4

139," My girlfriend of several years, whom I love very much has been going through really hard times. Family, Health, and mental health problems. 

It has really strained every aspect of our relationship. She has checked out, mentally, emotionally and physically for about 6 months. It's been very difficult for me. My days are generally full of anxiety about my place in life and weather or not this is the slow demise of what has always been a beautiful, healthy, loving relationship. 

I am just starting to see a therapist and she has always been seeing a therapist off and on I think. She's normally really well adjusted and emotionally aware, but it was like a switch flipped and she lost all feeling. She has been fighting a heavy depression ever since. 

This is the longest I have had an ongoing problem with a partner. Its been longer than 6 months that things fell apart, she just stopped responding to most things slowly, then entirely. Our intimacy level has diminished to a very low level. She normally is a very vibrant and affectionate person.

I feel absolutely alone in this world. Yes i do have my parents and sisters who support me and encourage me to do activities and get out, and i know some people, but they are not what you'd call friends.

I have no friends, nor have i ever dated a girl.

I just don't interact with people, i just use the internet after coming back home from collage. This lifestyle was fine for me until recently, but i recently started using tinder to try and find someone i could connect with personally, and just fell in a rabbit hole.

I also started using facebook and other social media, and started to realize how most people of my age have a social life at this point. I sudenly feel pressure to do something with my life, but i know there's nothing i can do.

People just show aversion towards me. People actively avoid me, pretend like they don't hear me, or straight up act hostile towards me, in a way that infuriates me. I'll greet my neighbours and none of them will respond. Same with most everyone. I feel like i don't even exist.

I cannot start a social life if people fucking hate me and i hate people because of my resentment towards them. I'm antisocial and asocial, but i don't want to be this way.

I'm alone, i don't know if i'm just that deep in the autistic spectrum.

I just feel like a piece of shit because i feel like everyone treats me like a piece of shit.

I hate both myself and everyone around me. I can't smile or be happy for shit. I only get joy from laughing at memes on the internet, and don't even enjoy that that much.

I just hate what i am, an asocial, shut down, barely existing person.

I'm on the process of being transfered from one pschologyst to another because i started feeling that it didn't work for me. I am going to a psichiatrist that doesn't help me for shit, who i see like every 3 months and is impossible to contact.

My sisters have all 3 moved out, so now i'm alone with my parents, and my dog, who doesn't even love me that much, despite the fact that he's a sweethart to everyone else.

142,"after having a pretty substantial breakdown earlier this year and starting to do school online since it became hard for me to go to my regular high school, i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder with obsessive-compulsive tendencies and i’ve been working with a therapist as well as trying out different meds and combinations of them to see what works. right now i’m in a place where it seems things have to get worse before they can get better. my prescription has made me feel like a zombie and highly prone to dissociation and confusing dreams with reality. it’s been hard to do much of anything lately but i have been working really hard and found a therapist that’s a really good fit for me. one success i have had is decreasing my social anxiety and tendency to perform my compulsions. however, i have one obsession that i can’t seem to stop thinking about all of the time: getting a pet. whether it be a dog, cat, rat, or lizard, i spend almost every waking hour thinking about having an animal companion. my mom and i spoke to my therapist about it and she recommended i maybe start volunteering at a shelter but i don’t have the energy to fulfill my current responsibilities right now. adding on a new one would do no good. i’m not in a place where i’m taking particularly good care of myself right now and logically i understand that getting a pet isn’t going to change that and wouldn’t be fair to the pet if i can’t take proper care of it. the absolute last thing that i want is to affect the life of an animal with my problems, but i can’t stop thinking of all the dogs and cats in shelters that need adopting. it’s so unfair that there aren’t enough people with open hearts to give them a better life and i just want to be one of those people. i have this fantasy that i’ll get a pet and all of a sudden it’ll give me purpose and motivation to not only turn my life around but give a little friend unconditional love and the best care possible. i can’t seem to stop thinking about it. every time i see someone walking their dog or see a dog on tv i can’t help but cry. i just really need some advice for how to cope with my current reality and spend my time thinking of more productive things.

tldr: i really want a pet, but my depression makes it hard to take care of myself most of the time plus i’m 17 and live with my mom, stepdad, and two little sisters so the adults in the house have the final say and they think it’s a bad idea. how to i deal with my obsession with adopting a pet in need and giving it a good home?",08Jul2019,1
143,"Just a disclaimer, I don't live in the US, and while they still got their own issues, police where I live is mainly great and very proffesional with many many years of schooling. 

To the post: 

I have started coming to terms with what I can only describe as pretty severe childhood abuse, most of it was surpressed so I am only now realizing the mental health consequences it have on me. One of the realizations I had last year is that very many people knew I had an abusive childhood - but nobody reported it. My father was investigated on violence charges towards other kids (not his, work related) and they failed to ask his actual kids if they ever experieced it. I told the person handling parental custody in divorces that I was terrified of my father and he still got custody, no follow ups. My mother left him because of the abuse, but assumed he'd treat the kids nicer if she just left. So all this have balled up to an immense feeling of sadness and abandonment, for all the chances I had to get away but nobody reported it. And so every time I see a police car irl I struggle not crying, because they are supposed to help people - but they never came to save me. 

I got away in my early twenties, so well over 15 yrs lost to that man. And It's so stupid, but I guess I still just want to be ""saved"", not even fix my problems, but to realize I struggle and just take the time to ask how I am, not online but in real life. Hopefully it will pass, because either starting to sob uncontrollably, or intensly focus not to cry every single time I see a police car irl is embarrising and tireing, but I guess it's also my way to grieve a lost childhood.",08Jul2019,1
144,I try to draw and after fucking up over and over again I lose control I end up fucking hating myself saying I'm shitty at everything I do and I'll never be good at it and I just think about how I'm shitty at everything and I shouldn't be here. This also happens in ANY activity where I mess up and have to do it over and over again. I'm normally a happy person though and I don't get it. throw away account,08Jul2019,2
145,"So first time poster I guess, I usually just read posts (literally created this account for a comment), but could really do with some mental health advice. I’m having really bad anxiety about an intense fear of ‘denied’ pregnancy.

I’m having increasingly regular panic attacks because I’m terrified about becoming pregnant and not knowing. I’m terrified, and have been for years, of being pregnant and am not sure if I want to ever have kids. My boyfriend have discussed surrogacy for the future if we do, because I’m quite sure it would be mentally bad for me and so physically bad for the hypothetical child. But it’s stepped up to a whole new level, becoming basically a attack every few days now. I think it’s been caused by a number of people around me becoming pregnant, some unplanned, and seeing more stories of people being unaware until labour. I’ve also been having some health issues of late, which can be associated with pregnancy, but I’m pretty sure are actually due to hereditary and worsened by anxiety (creating a cycle here). 

I know it’s an extreme reaction, but it’s really impacting me and I don’t know what to do. I’m on a 4 month waiting list for therapy, and have had Cbt for anxiety in the past, but when it was at a much lesser extent. I’m considering trying to scrape together enough to go private, as now I’m literally waking up panicking. Any advice whilst I can’t access therapy?",08Jul2019,1
