0,"Embraced my fear of vulnerability to share my mental health story. It's time to have a conversation in society about ending the stigma behind mental health. It's a conversation that involves all of us whether we've struggled or someone we know has.
I hope you're proud of it because even I am. Please let me know what you think and I'd be honored if you'd share it.

2,"I'm not sure if my mentality is an issue, it's simply unique.

I think society today had problems because things change so quickly. Today things change quicker than anything in history with the internet, etc. I think society is being crushed by the pressure of transition.

For me, neighbours go and disappear immediately. I'm a minority. I feel shocked when for example an event happened somewhat nearby and I see lots of people from my culture and ethnicity. It's a bit overwhelming to be around so many people talking the same language, looking the same, etc.

Despite all this diversity, multiculturalism, etc, it's really hard to find like minded people. People not like skinned, etc even if we might mutually disagree with things like mass immigration (but not against immigration otherwise when reasonable).

I'm going crazy. Every day I have people bashing me for being a realist, honest and atheist. Rubbing Ramadan in my face but not Christmas because we're biased against those.

I don't think people appreciate how easy it is to be isolated in the city. for sexuality gays have venues and events and I support that because I can understand the frustration otherwise of in normal dating scenes having most of the people you approach saying sorry but I'm not gay.

Aside from sodomy however, if you just want to share observations an analysis with people, you experience of reality, with others, then you're instantly isolated. It's hard to meet others like this and your neighbours on average last about 6 months.

If you want to take anything up your but hole it's easy but not if you want to take anything up your brain stem.",22Jun2019,1

4,"Background: Fourteen year old female with Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, and I probably have dysmorphia and an eating disorder, though I'm not sure which. Probably a hypochondriac, too.

I've always had this fear that I've been raped by a male family member. Specifically my older brother and my dad. I don't think it actually happened, though there is a small possibility my brother did something to me (my brother and I were talking once when he suddenly got very sad and grim. He started talking about how if I remember what he did at our old house he was really, really sorry and he wishes I could forgive him. He was nearly crying, but I don't remember. It scares me, I don't know what he could have done other than assaulted me that could have been that bad. We had this conversation a month or two ago. We lived in that house when I was ~6-8. He's five years older than me.)

I've been obsessed with this at least since I was nine or ten. Maybe obsessed isn't the right word, but I certainly have an unusual interest in it. I love stories where people get hurt sexually, though I guess I just like seeing people are damaged emotionally. I've looked up csa and cosca on tumblr a multitude of times, and whenever I do my legs turn to jelly. It's weirdly nice.

I'm an age regressor, though my older sister and brother are too. I self-harm, so I guess wanting to be abused and hurt makes sense. It's hard for me to cry, so I assume I want something I can cry about. All of this is non sexual. Me wanting something to cry about now, it makes sense why I would make something up in my past to cry about.

I make up a lot of symptoms. If it's in the DSM-5, I probably thought I had it at some point. OCD, DID, Borderline, Autism, Manic-depressive, I've thought of it all. It probably has to do with my Anxiety.

I don't like physical or emotional closeness much. The last person I dated, even though we dated for almost a full year, we never even kissed. Could also be attributed to Anxiety. I mention Anxiety a lot, sorry.

I don't tell anybody about what I think I have, so I don't want to say I'm doing it for attention, though I really think I'm doing it for my own personal gain, if that makes sense? Like I'm making up mental disorders and traumas so I don't have to take responsibility.",22Jun2019,2

I feel a depression sinking in. And it's okay, There's always music. Plus, how does one enjoy the beautiful moments in life without understanding the pain that the trials of life can also bring?

I'm just gonna roll with it, feed the beast if you will. 

It's been a years since I have been low like this, and instead of driving into unhealthy habits like I had in the past I am gonna BEAT the LIVING SH*T out of this depression, and I have a team of the best goonies by my side. My animals, who usually all have their respected areas of the house, have decided I need all of them on me any second I am not standing. And even then, my dog is leaning on me constantly. Holy fak, I couldn't be luckier. The love is real.

Therapy doesn't work for me. It actually brings out the liar in me because I feel judged (even though it's me judging my own thoughts, really.) And I do whatever I can to get them to tell me I seem mentally sound so I can get the hellllllll outta there. So instead of becoming a liar I am gonna go with the approach that has gotten me through soooo many struggles:


Doctor's Orders:
-Music Therapy. Get ya' sh*t togetha, mama.
-Nature workouts to find inspiration and adventures without trying. Nothing like racing the sunlight to the top of the mountain!
-Morning fog on mountain tops to refresh the soul. Gonna double tap those peaks for a few weeks. 
-Dogs, for compassion without need for words. 
-write. Whateverthefuck I need. Music lyric letters, love letters, lists... Whateverthefuck. 
-a road trip. Time to lay under the stars and dream about the future, cry with friends. Dodge bats in the darkness of the desert.
-create art. Time to get that box of tricks out, dust it off. Fuck shit uppppp. 
-hydrate. 
-sleep.

7,"I look and feel like a disaster at the moment, but I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I haven‚Äôt showered in months, haven‚Äôt properly left the house since college finished for the year and I ignore when I need a drink of water sometimes out of wanting to punish myself.

I‚Äôve never been great with hygiene to begin with (even as a young teen) and my parents and I would argue just to get me in the shower. Now they don‚Äôt bother anymore (since I‚Äôm 20F) now), but I still don‚Äôt bother. I just don‚Äôt see the point in looking good if I‚Äôm not going to leave the house, then I avoid leaving the house because social situations scare me. But they scare me before I think I look and feel like a disaster. I‚Äôm not really confident in my looks, particularly with my face due to a few disabilities.

I‚Äôve seen a 1-on-1 college mentor about my lack of confidence and social skills. It helped a bit, but I still feel screwed. Proper therapy isn‚Äôt an option though. I just want to hide in bed where it‚Äôs safe, but at the same time, I‚Äôm sick of existing day by day in my BO bubble and want to be something more than some useless disabled woman who doesn‚Äôt look after herself.",22Jun2019,1

9,"19M. Hello everyone. 

About a week ago on one site I saw a post about a man, who died and later was dismembered by his girlfriend. I clicked there, read the whole story and then saw horrible pictures of his dismembered body (I don‚Äôt really want to describe it in detail). 
I was a bit afraid that time, but nothing serious. I scrolled it and then forgot. 
However, several days later I was watching ‚ÄúChernobyl‚Äù TV series at 4 AM and suddenly the pictures has gone to my head. I couldn‚Äôt have stopped thinking about them as if someone told me ‚Äúnot to think about the pink elephant‚Äù. They were in my head, but I was able to sleep. 

Next days were disasters. 

I thought about it every minute, the pictures stuck there. I was trying to talk this out with my gf, but that didn‚Äôt help much. We went traveling, running, I did a lot of stuff to distract myself - nothing helped or helped very little. After that I felt like I‚Äôm in the nightmare and I just need to wake up, but I was already in the reality. 

Later I was able to change the horrible pictures with positive ones [(the method from here)](https://m.wikihow.com/Forget-Something-Horrible-You-Saw-on-the-Internet?amp=1) - a little cat and a dog. It relieved the attacks, but now my focus shifted to the story itself, not *only* pictures. 

I sometimes see my heart rate going to high numbers even when I‚Äôm suppressing the memories, and the quality of life has decreased significantly these days. I found that I was able to distract myself from images during the class, but the semester is ending next week. 

It was about 5 days since it first stuck in my head, and I cannot say if it is better or worse since then. I tried to find psychological help in my city, but since I am an international student in China, Shanghai, the price for consultation is unaffordable for me. 

If you have any advice, recommendation how to deal with it, I will be very grateful to you. 

Thank you very much.",22Jun2019,3
10,"Ok, so this is really hard to write because I'm on reddit, and I know what the community is like on this site, and I'm putting myself at risk of a lot of hate and bullying, something that happens to me a lot on forums when I broach this subject. So please, tender gloves.

I'm chubby and have been since childhood. I say chubby because while I am above average in weight (considerably) I can still find clothes in my size and have a relatively normal time getting around. For reference I am 5'6"" and I weigh about 260 pounds, and fluctuate 10 pounds above or below depending on my activity level.

My mom is very thin, has been her whole life. She enjoys fitness, and eats a very strict diet. In her youth she struggled with a restrictive eating disorder.

I moved in with her a few years ago. She's a TV addict - and I'm more into the computer - surfing, steaming, gaming. For a few hours a night/day she is in the living room binging her shows, while I sit up in my office. I noticed that she liked to DVR the TLC show My 600 Pound Life, and early on Saturday mornings I would often see her catching up with a bunch of episodes. She tried to get me to sit down and watch them regularly with her, but I found the first couple she showed me to be really biased and degrading to fat people, so I told her it wasn't my thing.

I know she watches them, she becomes obsessed with them, and I've never really said anything about it since watching it with her that one time last year. But lately when I walk into the room, if she has it on, she instantly turns it off, or turns the tv off. I've told her she doesn't have to do that. That I know it's what she's watching, and that it doesn't bother me if she likes the show.

But it does bother me that she feels like she needs to keep it a secret. She's always trying to augment my diet, she makes (not unkind) comments about my eating habits. For example, sometimes I will go into the kitchen for a drink or a snack between meals and she'll say something like ""Oh how can you eat after that big lunch? Omg I am so full!"" I've called her out on it a couple of times, and she insists she's just commenting on her own lack of hunger, but it feels like passive aggressive guilt tripping or food policing. For my Birthday last year she bought me a gym membership, which I used for about a month before determining it wasn't my thing, and canceling it. Lately she's been saying ""Let's just eat chicken and vegetables."" I've noticed on the show that's the primary nutrition plan of the weight loss patients. A couple of months ago she made an appointment with a weight-loss surgeon behind my back, and copped to it soon after she made the appointment. I believe she wasn't going to tell me about it, and was going to try to either trick me into saying ""Ok, let's go see him."" (she likes to manipulate people by making them believe her idea was their idea) or she intended to ambush me by bringing me there under the guise of something else.

I feel like she obsessively watches My 600 Pound Life in order to find tips or tricks to passively use in order to 'help' me lose weight. I've also considered that perhaps its not about me at all, that she's watching them (in secret, she believes) as a form of reverse-thinspo. Either way, it really bothers me, not that she indulges in this television show, but that she feels the need to hide it from me. I've talked about it with her in the past, but it never seems to solve anything. I don't know what to do about this, because if I explain that I think she's watching them because she wants to help me lose weight, she'll continue to hide them from me, but if I don't, she'll continue to hide them.

How can I have a productive and honest conversation with my mother about how her actions really hurt me without justifying her secrecy? Why can't I just be enough for her as a fat person? How do I get her to understand that I'd rather the emphasis on my body be health based and not weight based? I'm really of the mindset that I shouldn't have to change in order for people to treat me better, but that society should change the way they treat fat people. And that I don't really want to lose weight, especially not if the primary motivation to do so is shame.",22Jun2019,1
11,"I've never really done this, I mean I saw a therapist once but all she repeated was that I should  try going to AA when I drink maybe once a year if i feel like it. I've been considering whether or not I should see a psychiatrist because I've been battling the same demons for the last 10 years such as depression, anxiety, knowing what I want to do in life but just feeling unable to will myself into working on it whether it be my website ideas or losing weight.

I was with a girl for 4 years got engaged and when I was at college she cheated on me and left me (found  out she cheated by some friends she never told me). I left college after that and ended up with a lot of debt and oweing the college money so I couldn't get my transcripts. I entered the work force, got a good job manual labor, good benefits and pay but job is not interesting and unenjoyable but it pays a livable wage. Been here 5 years now and I feel like nothing's changed I still get home which I still live with my mom(I'm 28) hop on the computer smoke weed and play video games. 

I just feel like I can't break the cycle, I had so many ideas and dreams that I still hope I will get off my lazy ass and do but I can't stop hating my life and where its gone, I just feel so lazy and hate myself but no energy to stop any of it and I feel like the longer this goes on the less of my happiness and soul remain.

So my main question is that, do people find that getting a psychiatrist helps? I just feel that something must be wrong with me to feel this way for so long and feel so completely helpless in changing it.

Sorry for the life story but I really could use some help",22Jun2019,1
12,"Growing up emotionally neglected, I harbored a lot of bitterness towards my parents; mainly my mother because if she wasn't ignoring me, she was ""punishing me."" In January, after I started taking my antidepressants, I finally brought it up to my mom. She confessed that she was going through depression and having suicidal thoughts while raising my brother and I, thus affecting her parenting. This broke my heart as I reflected back to my childhood memories where I had said terrible things that probably made her feel worse. After the talk, we decided to try to be more understanding. 

School had ended a month ago and I've been mainly home, lazing around and wanting to be alone. But my mom has been bothering me at moments when I REALLY want to be left alone. Yesterday we got into a fight. She hit me, and I was instantly transported back into my childhood, when I wasn't able to defend myself. That made me blind with fury and I hit back, forgetting how much stronger I was compared to my mother. As an Asian American, this action stunned both my mother and I. My mom asked if it would make me feel better if she had died. But in my stupid pride, I shot back, saying that I would rather be dead, that way I wouldn't have to deal with anyone or anything. My mom told me she didn't want that because I was her daughter and she was the mother... I told her I didn't see her as my mother. 

Growing up, I saw a lot of daughters calling their mothers' their ""best friend."" I still don't understand that sentiment, and I guess that's part of the reason I'm so bitter at my mom. I see what things ""should be"" and get resentful when I don't have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know what I did and said are probably unforgivable, but I am truly sorry. I also know I should be apologizing to my mother, instead of writing this but I need advice. I want to change; I want to get better, so that I can show my mom through my actions that I'm trying to get better. Is there any advice you guys can give me?",22Jun2019,2
13,"A couple weeks ago, I was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was absolutely ecstatic to receive the diagnosis because so many things about my life, who I am, and how I behave started to click and make sense. The enemy you know is better than the one you don‚Äôt.

One thing has been on my mind, constantly. I tend to exaggerate _a lot_, to the point where it can even be construed or interpreted as lying but in the moment when I make these statements, I truly and genuinely believe that I‚Äôm telling the truth. Today for example, I missed my bus going home after a grueling journey to a doctors office (no car and can‚Äôt drive because of medication) and I was venting to my mom about the state of public transit and I said something to the effect of ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be home for another three hours‚Äù (it took just over 2) and later, when I told her I was home, she called me out for ‚Äúlying and saying it was going to be three hours‚Äù.  I was admittedly a bit upset because I wasn‚Äôt trying to lie to my mom whom I adore; I was just incredibly stressed out and made a claim that was somewhat false but I never intended to lie or deceive her.

In hindsight, many moments of my life play out like this, largely correlated to when I‚Äôm really stressed out. I make a claim to back up an argument, one I believe is true at the time, and later realize that I was incorrect. Is this tendency for hyperbole part of being bipolar? If it is, how can I effectively combat it? Could this be driven by something else like my anxiety? Would love to hear what other people have been through and how to best solve this issue.",22Jun2019,1
14,"I know this sounds stupid, and yeah, probably it is, but, it's a serious problem to me. So, context: I'm 14 (and mexican, so, sorry for my bad english) and, since I was a child, I had this problem:

When I was like 8, I got a serious ear infection, that, eventually, pierced my eardrum. One night, I decided that it was time to sleep, so, I went to my bed and I sleeped. A few hours later, I got a nightmare, and I woke up. I was sweating, and I started to feeling weird. It's hard to describe even in my native language, but I'll try my best to describe this.

First, all my actions feel longer than they are. \*\*LONGER\*\*. I cough for a couple seconds, but, in my head, I think I will cough for literally billions years. I know this is stupid, but it gives me anxiety. I feel intimidated, I feel fear. I don't even know why this happen. A simple trip to the bathroom, that maybe last 1 minute, will last billions year in my head. I think I will never stop coughing, or I will never get to the bathroom. Also, I start to hallucinate. I hear voices, like if my family was having a normal conversation, but they're sleeping. I hear steps, and, sometimes, I see people passing through my house (No, I dont believe in ghost if you're asking, I know this is psychological). Also, all my enviroment doesn't feel the same. I touch something, but it doesn't feel like if it was that thing. Sometimes I even feel I cannot touch anything, like if I was levitating. Things randomly change its size and shape. I can see my normal room, but, a couple of seconds later, it gets more leght, like if I was nearly a black hole of something like that. 

By last,  all this things working together in my head make me more sick than I already am. I get nauseous, I start to cough hard. I feel stomachache, I sweat. I don't know anyone that has this problem too. I asked to friends, classmates, I have already searched on internet, but I have never found something like this. Probably I bad described all this, but I don't speak english at all. I apologize for all my mistakes, but, really, I would like to know what I have. I have considered to go with a psychologist, but my mom doesn't want. Reddit is the only place where I think I can found my problem, and maybe solve it.

15,"Some background information: I‚Äôm an 18 year old female with severe ADHD and what I thought was moderate depression. I‚Äôm currently in counselling and looking into Vivanc.

I also want to note that I‚Äôm well aware what I‚Äôm about to describe is completely inappropriate behaviour, and I‚Äôve thoroughly apologized to my ex about it, and continually told him he didn‚Äôt deserve to see any of it. 


I‚Äôve been in an extremely hot and cold relationship since September. We are currently not officially together but I‚Äôm experiencing a pregnancy scare. My ex goes back and forth between, ‚Äúif I‚Äôm pursuing other people right now it‚Äôs none of your business‚Äù and ‚Äúonce you‚Äôre mentally stable I‚Äôll marry you.‚Äù And I go back and forth between trusting him.

Yesterday I lost my debit card and the last place I had seen it was at his house. This was an extremely inconvenient time as I had been planning on getting my pass port pic updated for a job. I got increasingly more frustrated and began looking everywhere I thought it could be, moving tables and swearing loudly about the situation in the process. I asked my ex if it might be under his bed and he insisted it wasn‚Äôt. I kept asking him to get up off the bed so I could lift it up and see if it had slipped under, but he refused. I tried lifting it up myself but ripped some plastic on his mattress spring in the process. I was crying. He was furious about this and started kicking me out of his house. I started collecting my things and I asked for my ephedrine back. Then I impulsively dumped the entire thing in my mouth. I don‚Äôt know why I did that and I would have spat it out right way if I wasn‚Äôt so embarrassed I had done it in the first place.

My ex and I have had our fair share of fights, but I‚Äôve never acted this childish during one. I‚Äôve also had a couple suicidal moments, as in taking a few too many Tylenol - nothing lethal - then rationalizing with myself before things got too drastic. 

I ended up called the paramedics because I didn‚Äôt know how much had dissolved on my to tongue and I was admitted to the ER for a few hours. I asked the doctor to look into a personality assessment for BPD, but he said based on his impression of me that I probably don‚Äôt have it. I also got a confirmation I‚Äôm pregnant, so that‚Äôs shitty. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting that what is prompting to do this is that my texts between my ex and I at  conveniently deleted and his most recent one told me that he is hanging out with a new girl. I can‚Äôt remember deleting the texts, which is the valid thing that‚Äôs cheesing me. I‚Äôm not holding onto my phone a lot of times I hang out with him
and he knows my password.

I know I‚Äôm not entitled to anything from my ex after my behaviour, but he has a history of lying to and manipulating exes as well as lying to and somewhat manipulating me so I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs my maybe being ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and what‚Äôs him taking advantage of me.

Please don‚Äôt tell me not to communicate with this guy after the visit to the clinic. He knows about the scare. I just want know if I sound like someone with BPD. Thanks in advance.

16,"So I struggle with major depression, it's generally not a fun experience. I just left my old job where I worked full time but only made minimum wage with a bunch of kids (18-22yos) for a new adult job that pays incredibly well (like three times what I made at my last one). So I took it with almost no hesitation or question when offered the position. I've been there exactly a week and I am starting to wonder if I made the right choice. My co-workers are amazing, they're beautiful people. Took me out to lunch on my first day, threw a party for me this afternoon to welcome me. But when I think about the future and the tasks i'll be doing. I don't think i'll be happy at this job. Which is confusing me because I'm pretty much unhappy all the time. I was hoping to get away from guests services and this job pretty much deals entirely with customers who are angry over questionable policies and I found out I would be the first person they'd interact with, i also can't generally react well when people are berating me, my mind often goes blank and I lose all focus and it tends to upset me all day, i totally take baggage home with me. A part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt (since they're good people) and stick around another week or two just to really see what it's like - the other part of me wants to leave now and not risk wasting any of their time and resources when it would be so easy for them to hire someone else. I was told I could go back to my old job if this new one didn't work out. Anyway thanks for you time, maybe someone can share a similar experience.

17,"Hello everyone, recently I have deceived to take a break from religion. Growing up I was exposed to a very strict baptist church (hellfire and yelling style of preaching). I attended this church from birth till around 8 years old. At this point in my life my family left and began to attend another baptist (literally 10 feet away from my house).  This church had a very similar style of preaching where he‚Äôll and shame is drilled into people. But the pastors and congregation explain that they are preaching love. I attended this church till I turned 21. I am currently 22 years so this change has been very recent. I found that church had become far to political and illogical. I am really struggling with guilt and shame since I am confused with my sexual orientation. I am not sure if this is anxiety but I feel like I am constantly seeing signs of religion and possibly god telling me to go back. Any suggestions?

18,"I just recently joined this reddit. I hope i can find some sort of explanation here.

Basically, ever since i was maybe 6 years old, i have an extremely hard time being in a room alone, especially at night and especially if its dark and quiet. When i was eventually forced to quit sleeping with my parents it was a huge struggle, my parents would have to lock me in my room and confiscate the lamp so I could get used to the dark. I was absolutely terrified. Eventually i was able to sleep alone on the conditions that my parents were making noticeable noise outside my room, the hallway light was on, and my door was open. Now that I‚Äôm a bit older, if the feeling comes on, i play a youtube video with lots of talking on my phone and thats usually enough to get me to sleep. 

You see, for the past 15 years of my life, i‚Äôve had a very irrational ‚Äúfear‚Äù. I put fear in quotes because i‚Äôm not sure if you can call it fear, as i‚Äôm not afraid of anything specific. If i am in a room alone that is quiet and or dark, i get this feeling of disattatchment. I would feel as if i was in danger and i needed to get out, and that wherever i was wasnt safe. Kinda like i‚Äôm in a different world entirely. I forget that i‚Äôm at home/the place i‚Äôm in and i forget that people are still around me.This fear can be debilitating at times. I could have full on panic attacks from this irrational feeling. It also has very specific requirements, it only ever happens when i‚Äôm alone. The feeling goes away if i hear talking or noises made by someone, for example coughing or footsteps. I feel like this might be because it brings me back to reality, and reminds me that i‚Äôm still in my home and i‚Äôm still safe and around people. It also gets considerably worse if i‚Äôve had irregular sleep or nightmares. I‚Äôm asking reddit about this because recently my sleep cycle has been extremely messed up, and for the past week i‚Äôve been regularly having sleep paralysis and nightmares. This has made that feeling of disattatchment extremely bad. I cannot be alone in a room at all for more than 10 minutes regardless of the light levels.

19,"I have anger problems. It‚Äôs rare they ever show, but I get to the point of murderous. And while it‚Äôs bad at slight inconveniences or problems, it is almost always present, a good 80% of the time. I‚Äôve been working on being super kind to my friends and family always and venting out my anger and rage elsewhere. It comes out at times, such as working hard on the farm, or something really bad happens. 

Today was actually a really good day. Until a particular chicken (one I really hated for multiple reasons) on the farm I found out was the egg eater we were trying to find (you have to kill those or else they eat all the eggs). I was so glad it was him, and I immediately killed him. I was happy that day, and then at the slightest provocation with the allowance to commit harm, I chopped off his head. 

I‚Äôm writing this to vent, and to mark the point where I stop this madness. I need to get over this, and I‚Äôve made progress, but obviously not enough. You know how some chickens keep going after their heads cut off? He gave me a lot of time to think while I tried to get him to stop moving. And I need to get past this. 

If you read this thanks for hearing me vent. If you have suggestions or tips I‚Äôm all ears, I‚Äôll try it.

TL:DR; I have anger issues and I killed a rooster as soon as he gave me the chance, and that‚Äôs wrong.",22Jun2019,3

21,"        I just don‚Äôt really feel things. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt a real, moving feeling. I‚Äôm indifferent. I only really feel panic - when my grades drop too much or when I do something very wrong - or anger/annoyance- when I get interrupted or made to do something. 

        I don‚Äôt eat much. I haven‚Äôt had breakfast in a couple of weeks. I haven‚Äôt made my bed in a few months. I usually go to sleep around 3-4 am. My room is messy. There are things on the floor, it‚Äôs a dump.  I overwork myself. I can‚Äôt relax easily. All this got worse when school got out.

        I have toyed with the idea of self harm for a while, and I think a lot about suicide. I know I won‚Äôt kill myself, but I think about it, like the different ways I can do it, how easy it is to end your life. I‚Äôve thought about self harm and I‚Äôm afraid I might actually do it someday.

22,"Okay, so.. My heads a mess.

It's my first time posting here so please be gentle!

I have a diagnosis if GAD, depression and chronic migraine but despite this I feel like my symptoms are currently more than just GAD or maybe my anxiety is just playing up.... A lot.

My current state:

Constant severe anxiety, worrying about everything, overthinking everything, agitated, irritable, jumpy, tired but insomniac, shaky, sweaty. My head feels so full and thinking really hurts, there's no space in my head to process thoughts, commands, anything.

I have 1000 grand plans but no motivation to do anything with them, really, I just want to hide or disappear.

I'm not suicidal but im indifferent.

My sex drive is through the roof high,  its usually high but its turning into an obsession and its messing with my head more. This happens occasionally.

I feel like my mind and my body belong to two separate people, my thoughts too. I keep talking myself down at the final moment before doing something reckless. Realising the repercussions just in time.

Part of me wants to destroy everything I have but the other part is too sensible/anxious to allow it but it's getting harder and harder to cope. 

I have also been having a lot of derealization moments as well as more and more hearing sounds and voices but only in snippets, like my name or hello or laughing / singing.

This is completely muddled with no real flow, sorry for that. I guess I'm really wondering whether all this is just anxiety... From experience. Not looking for a diagnosis",22Jun2019,4
23,"I have a friend who keeps trying to break up with her live-in boyfriend due to long-term goal differences. 

Every time she tries to break up with him, he tell her he has thoughts of suicide and the stress cause him to develop a stutter. She cares about him and doesn't want to hurt him, but doesn't want to sacrifice her dreams to live his. 

How should she deal with the situation?",22Jun2019,3
24,"I've noticed that relatively recently (i.e. in the last 4-5 years) I've stopped forming my own opinions, or caring about them if I do. I don't have any strong preferences for anything, really. It's impossible for me to choose a restaurant for lunch, or pick one of two differently colored shirts. It's like even very distinct things just read the same to me. 

I don't shop for clothes often, just because I'm aware I'm going to wear the same outfit time and time again. If I find a thing I like to eat, I will eat it nonstop, with no variations or changes. I feel boring. 

I hardly ever say no to anyone. I acquiesce to most request, be it for my money, my space or my time. It rarely, if ever occurs to me to say no, and when it does, it somehow seems impossible. Only when I'm provoked to an extremity (by some other circumstances) do I actually deny someone something they want. My friends and associates refer to me as extraordinarily nice because of this, but I don't think it counts as being nice if I feel forced to behave the way I do.

I feel  a strange lack of control over my life and feel oddly distant from myself because of this. I feel as if everyone else ""always gets what they want"", both from me and from life in general, when in truth they may only seem to me because they actually advocate for their desires, and I never do. I also feel as if the latter of this statement is odd, because I don't really know what I want.

Does anyone else experience this? If so, why do you think you do?",22Jun2019,3

27,"I've been struggling with this for about two years now, and I've posted about my problem on here a few months ago, but I still cannot get over it. I dont think anybody is taking me seriously, because it doesnt really ""seem"" like a serious problem, but I have a crush on this boy that has developed into an obsession. Like, a really bad obsession. I have spent hours and hours looking at pictures of him, looking up all of his family members on Google and daydreaming and thinking of him. So its not just a normal ""crush"". Since February last year I've kind of gotten into this depression. Also, I've been having suicidal thoughts almost everyday lately, and it scares me because sometimes I get worried I'll be impulsive and actually do it, even though I would never because it would hurt my family. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and OCD in the past but it was a long time ago and for a completely different reason. I just want to stop feeling like this, because I don't know how much longer I can take it, to be honest. I also fear that I'm going to lose all of my friends over this because they always get annoyed and angry at me when I talk about him. I know this sounds kind of silly but I feel ""trapped"", because I'm scared that i will never get over him and I'll be like this for the rest of my life or commit suicide over him. I'm a 14 year old girl, by the way. I just really needed to get this off my chest, I dont care if no one responds.",22Jun2019,2
28,"I don't really know what I'm looking for but I need help, and I don't really know where else to go. 

This is kind of a long story so hang in there. I used to be a very confident person with no real problems, I am very blessed and have been given a great life. However in the past 4 months I have had undergone huge change. 

It started with my school wrestling team, I joined for the first time in my senior year. Wrestling matchups are assigned by weight class. I never used to worry about my weight, yea I was a little chubby but I wouldn't have said I was obese. I didn't worry about my weight at all. I was in the 89kg category at 5'10 (male). This didn't bother me at all. Until I had won Gold and I saw my photo in the skin tight uniform. So I decided to lose weight. In possibly the worst way possible. Water fasting 12 days only water one day eating lunch and dinner then another 12 days no food only water. This lost me my first 35 pounds due to the huge amounts of cardio I did in addition to fasting. After my fast I felt good but I wanted to be better. I joined the gym and stayed on a 1000 calorie diet for a month and lost another 15 or so pounds. Now at 64kg down from 89kg I felt good and wanted to gain muscle. The problem I realized I was addicted to seeing my weight go down. I had been depriving myself of food for so long it hit me hard. For a week I cycled as follows. Eat insane amount of food in one sitting 2000 calories at a time or more of cereal, peanut butter and nutella. Then throw up for the next 4 hours to undo my mistake. Weeks of this and I keep saying I want to stop but I can't. I can't break it because I still see myself as fat and not good enough. I want to go back to living a normal life. Not my obsessive calorie counting, constant weighing and over the top cardio nightmare.",22Jun2019,1
29,"Deleting and reposting as somebody pointed out I was not specific in the title regarding what mental illness I‚Äôm wondering about.

Some background information: I‚Äôm an 18 year old female with severe ADHD and what I thought was moderate depression. I‚Äôm currently in counselling and looking into Vivanc.

I also want to note that I‚Äôm well aware what I‚Äôm about to describe is completely inappropriate behaviour, and I‚Äôve thoroughly apologized to my ex about it, and continually told him he didn‚Äôt deserve to see any of it. 


I‚Äôve been in an extremely hot and cold relationship since September. We are currently not officially together but I‚Äôm experiencing a pregnancy scare. My ex goes back and forth between, ‚Äúif I‚Äôm pursuing other people right now it‚Äôs none of your business‚Äù and ‚Äúonce you‚Äôre mentally stable I‚Äôll marry you.‚Äù And I go back and forth between trusting him.

Yesterday I lost my debit card and the last place I had seen it was at his house. This was an extremely inconvenient time as I had been planning on getting my pass port pic updated for a job. I got increasingly more frustrated and began looking everywhere I thought it could be, moving tables and swearing loudly about the situation in the process. I asked my ex if it might be under his bed and he insisted it wasn‚Äôt. I kept asking him to get up off the bed so I could lift it up and see if it had slipped under, but he refused. I tried lifting it up myself but ripped some plastic on his mattress spring in the process. I was crying. He was furious about this and started kicking me out of his house. I started collecting my things and I asked for my ephedrine back. Then I impulsively dumped the entire thing in my mouth. I don‚Äôt know why I did that and I would have spat it out right way if I wasn‚Äôt so embarrassed I had done it in the first place.

My ex and I have had our fair share of fights, but I‚Äôve never acted this childish during one. I‚Äôve also had a couple suicidal moments, as in taking a few too many Tylenol - nothing lethal - then rationalizing with myself before things got too drastic. 

I ended up called the paramedics because I didn‚Äôt know how much had dissolved on my to tongue and I was admitted to the ER for a few hours. I asked the doctor to look into a personality assessment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but he said based on his impression of me that I probably don‚Äôt have it. I also got a confirmation I‚Äôm pregnant, so that‚Äôs shitty. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting that what is prompting to do this is that my texts between my ex and I at  conveniently deleted and his most recent one told me that he is hanging out with a new girl. I can‚Äôt remember deleting the texts, which is the valid thing that‚Äôs cheesing me. I‚Äôm not holding onto my phone a lot of times I hang out with him
and he knows my password.

I know I‚Äôm not entitled to anything from my ex after my behaviour, but he has a history of lying to and manipulating exes as well as lying to and somewhat manipulating me so I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs my maybe being ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and what‚Äôs him taking advantage of me.

Today I woke up and it was like nothing ever happened.

Please don‚Äôt tell me not to communicate with this guy after the visit to the clinic. He knows about the scare. I just want know if I sound like someone with BPD. Thanks in advance.

31,"Whenever I get into a hobby, or really anything, I turn it into a life or death situation. Most people can just go to the gym, do a workout, and be done. Me, I think about the workout at least twice a day every day and I put immense pressure on myself to perform the best I possibly can, and when I do what I set out to do it is never enough. I treat it like ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt lift this weight this many times, your life is over‚Äù.

Right now I am learning web development to become a freelancer and maybe work full time somewhere. And all I can think about is ‚Äúok you have to learn this today.

33,"I've been dealing with violent and sexual obsessive thoughts for 6 years, could this be OCD? I know I shouldn't get diagnostics from people on the internet, and I obviously won't claim to have OCD until I get diagnosed from a health professional, but I am very confused and would like to hear from others who deal with this. I really don't feel comfortable talking to my doctor about it and my current therapist is ignoring my worries about it, so here I am.

This all started when I was 14. I was already diagnosed professionally with generalized anxiety disorder, and later would be diagnosed with depression. Around that time I started having very obsessive thoughts of physically fighting and maiming my family members, as well as stabbing myself in the stomach with a knife/scissors. These thoughts would arise everyday for hours. The thoughts of stabbing myself were the worst and sometimes it would be the only thing I could think about, even while trying to do school and ballet. My grades didn't take a hit and I was doing well at dance, but the thoughts were there nonetheless. The only thing that would help was to repeatedly punch myself in the stomach and or bite my wrists. These thoughts lasted for about 3 years. I'm 20 now and the thoughts don't upset me as much (though sometimes I'll get a particularly bad one and get pretty emotional). Now I'll get thoughts of having sex with my professors (I'm asexual, so these bug me a lot), genital mutilation, gore, violence, necrophilia, pushing people into traffic, killing animals/babies, and doing just generally weird things like randomly screaming or ripping my clothes off. I've dealt with these for so long that I know how to distract myself and calm myself down, but they still make me feel like I'm crazy or weird. However, I don't have compulsions? Or at least I don't think so? I pace in my room a lot because I like to daydream, but I don't usually do this after I have an obsessive thought, or feel like I have to to keep the thoughts away, so they're probably not even related. I've heard people with Pure OCD have just the obsessions without the compulsions, so that could be a possibility.

I've never told any of this to anyone for 6 years because I was expected to be the quiet, reliable kid in my family and I was scared of being sent to a mental hospital. It's really frustrating because I'm finally opening up about a lot of trauma and problems I dealt with completely alone, but I still feel like I can't tell anyone about these thoughts because I'm still too scared to tell my family and doctor, and I've been trying to get a good therapist for months.

Would like to hear from people who have similar problems, or know of people with similar problems. I hate dealing with this everyday and having no one who understands. Thanks for reading.",22Jun2019,1

anyway. one of my recent dwellings i guess is just wanting to be mentally broken down to the point of being nothing. like an ego death essentially. i want to be a crying, screaming mess that's completely degraded and broken down. basically so i can eventually build myself back up. i've considered psychedelics but instead of trying to go through with that i should probably ask my therapist why the hell i'm like this. i'm wondering if anyone else gets the same thoughts or like fantasies i guess? i'm kind of a masochist also so maybe that contributes.",22Jun2019,1

37,"I'll start off with my mother.  She has and always has been mentally abusive.  I live with her and my two siblings who are mentally disabled from birth to 18.  Im almost 20 now. My brother and sister always and still do agree eith my mom on anything.  If my mom thinks i did something wrong so did they so the whole house would be against me.  This was never fun because it was usually manipulation.  I knew they didnt understand that though.  I never noticed it but my bestfriend did when we were 15 . she made me realized what mentally abusive parents were and these traits.  I never noticed it because thats all i knew.  She would talk about my weight, call me names, make me feel worthless, and even before i moved out and had a job would constatnly take my money and criticized me for what i used my money on.  I realized that this is all wrong and even tried to confront her on it.  She still to this day thinks she did nothing wrong at all.  The first time i cut her off she would try to get family members/friends to talk/text me to see what im doing so they could go back and tell her.  Even if they saw me in public.  I even tried to tell family members but they never cared/believed me . her herself would constantly text me everyday after i did after i told her i wanted nothing to do with her.  It was bad the first few months.  But after almost a year I gave her a chance for a little while.  She was actually not mentally abusive to me for a bit . but then she started again.  The last time I really had anything to do with her was April of this year.  It was one night it was storming and I asked to borrow her car to go somewhere and have fun because i actually had a weekend off for once at that time (i worked a lot and still do) she did and it started storming badly while i went out with my bestfriend and her sister.  At first she told me when we were done i would have to get a Lyft to take me home because she didnt want to drive me back because ""her eyesight was bad"", knowing i dont have a vehicle.  She could still see she just didnt want to take me.  While it was storming bad, we were shopping for an animal we had at the time and told me to come home because of the storms.  The thing is though, my mom gets too scared about anything especailly when the weather isnt great.  Even if it was raining she didnt want me out doing anything.  I drive good. so i would make sure we were too.  She told me while at the store if i just took my friend home and came back to her house she would take me home.  Then i was like well okay ill do that . i followed along with that and when i got home she told me that she wouldnt take me home, likr she never said ehat she did on the phone while i was at the store, I actually only had $7 on my card when thr night was over but i wanted to save it until i got paid.  She proceeded to say she wouldnt take me home no matter what and didnt care and told me to get a ride home.  She done things like this a million times before . trust me. Also keep in mind she started drinking that night too but im sure she was okay to drive.  If she wasnt i wouldnt ask her to do so.  So i sat in her car figuring out what to do and I just told her i was walking home.  She kept texting and blowing my phone up saying ""get a ride home"" over and over . saying that i had money to . i even told her what i had in my account.  I told her again i was walking home and the then the thing she told me was ""try not to get raped!"" ""Im tired of these games with you"" and i . didnt. Even. Do. Anything . that was the last straw.  I wanted nothing else to do with her and it showed her true colors to me.  I ended up just getting a Lyft home anyway because it was raining and it was a little bit away.  I confronted her on it and she never said sorry for saying that.  She told this one lady shes close to that ""she was being sarcastic"" . rape isnt a joke.  It was wrong and i didnt deserve that.  After i told her i wanted nothing to do with her, she still talks about me and my sister or mom would still ask when i worked and such too.  So i knoe this time i would really just have to cut a lot of people off who surrounded my mom because 99% of the people who do surround her that ive told about her dont care that thats how she is to me.  They just chose to ignore it really.  I mean they cant do much i dont think but still.  It would have been nice for someone to understand the tramas ive been through.  . this all comes up because i listined to Kasey Musgraves' introlude in her album called ""mother"" sometimes i wish my mother isnt the way she is and someone who REALLY cared about me.  But im still processing that you dont need family to be okay or happy. You could always have your own thats not blood related.  Sometimes i just get sad though.  im sorry this is so long but i thought i would share my story to someone who might have mentally abusive parents. If you do, i am a message away if you want to talk.  I am here with you. Thank you to those who got this far.  I hope someone out there understands this.  I am scared to post this at the moment but i know there is someone out there that could relate to this and know they are not alone. Thank you for reading.",22Jun2019,1
38,"(I‚Äôm not necessarily looking for a ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù. I‚Äôm just hoping that my quote at the end of the post will resonate or click with someone so that they can share their similar experience/experiences with me and whoever else. ALSO: as I am new to reddit and unfamiliar with standard posting practice/etiquette, if someone wanted to suggest a website/blog/different thread for me to post stuff like this, I would appreciate it!)

For most of my life I have had increasingly worsening mental health issues where I am always given seemingly simple diagnoses that result in trying various antidepressants, mood stabilizers, etc. For years now I have suspected that it is something more than depression or anxiety, or at least something more complex. I am afraid to ask my psychiatrist what mental disorder/disorders he thinks I ‚Äúhave‚Äù because I fear I will be seen as a hypochondriac, and therefore may not be taken seriously. Side note: I have often feared that I ‚Äúhave‚Äù hypochondria and have worried that ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù my mental issues are simply caused by my own fear of such issues. He has mentioned emotional regulation disorder(aka BPD) but has never told my IF I actually am diagnosed with it. I often wonder if what I‚Äôm experiencing is not yet publicly discovered or named yet. I have been going to a psychiatrist for years; you‚Äôd think I would be given some thorough testing to figure out what may be wrong with me so that I can properly treat it! I feel defeated trying to figure this all out; I think the reason I majored in psychology in college may have actually been because I wanted to figure myself out so bad! I just wish a psychologist could sit me down and tell me my diagnoses so that I can work on treating them/bettering myself. When I have asked my psychiatrist about it in the past, he seems vague and says ‚Äúseems like‚Äù. So is that a diagnoses or not?! Given what medications I‚Äôve been on and things that have been talked about by my psychiatrists over the years, I suspect my current psychiatrist has me listed as having GAD, MDD(even tho I think persistent depressive disorder should be cycled in there as well, but maybe it‚Äôs not important to differentiate it, idk?), SAD, BPD, BED, OCD. When it comes to issues that I‚Äôm scared/ashamed/embarrassed to bring up out of fear of appearing dramatic or attention seeking, I strongly think I have C-PTSD, and I think it‚Äôs possible I may have some sort of form of schizophrenia (a type or form with many negative symptoms, not positive symptoms such as hallucinations). One time I brought up disorganized schizophrenia to my psychiatrist (which I am now aware that subtypes aren‚Äôt really used anymore) and he dismissed the possibility since I don‚Äôt have hallucinations. This makes me really sad and confused because from what I understand, not having hallucinations is not a sole indicator that you DON‚ÄôT have schizophrenia. Anyways I‚Äôm at a point where I believe my ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù aren‚Äôt taken that seriously since I haven‚Äôt spiraled out of control, YET. I don‚Äôt want to wait until I become unmanageable; I want to figure out what I‚Äôm going through so I can‚Äôt fix it before it gets worse! Another side note: in regards to my difficulty in getting confirmed verbal mental disorder diagnoses, I often wonder how mental disorder diagnosis statistics are reported/taken into account?! I don‚Äôt want to go into exact detail of my daily struggles/family history/etc in this first post since I initially wanted this to be simple, but anyways the main point...I realized today that a possibly relatable description of a part of what I‚Äôm experiencing is ‚ÄúI feel like my mind and mental processes are abnormally scattered throughout different levels of subconsciousnesses.‚Äù I thought of this description and realized it might be something that would click with someone else.

42,"As a kid, I‚Äôve been no stranger to dissociation. I was diagnosed with ADHD from an early age, so day dreaming and losing my train of thought was a normal occurrence to me. Recently though, I‚Äôve started dissociating in a different way. I will go into these states of thinking about the world around me as if I‚Äôm not actually there. I feel as if I‚Äôm inhabiting this vessel of a person and I‚Äôm not actually that person. I feel like an imposter or a stand in, someone possessing this body and their actual mind perished a long fine ago and I just hold their memories as I continue on in their place. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm having an out of body experience and just being aware of this body I‚Äôm inhabiting but not being fully connected to it. 

Other times I will of how meaningless one life and their actions on the world is, not even just on earth just in this whole universe. I am literally just a speck of cosmic space dust that can stop existing any moment. I think about the world just stopping a lot. Doesn‚Äôt even end just. Stops. And no one could do anything about it. 

I‚Äôve never really experienced this magnitude of dissociation since the past year. It honestly scares me and makes me wonder if I‚Äôm sane. Once I‚Äôm out of the states I feel stupid for believing my thoughts during them, but the same thing occurs during the states, me being stupid for thinking a world like this actually exists.

What I‚Äôm asking is 1) what is happening with me? I looked it up and it looked like dissociative disorder? But I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm trying to process this with answers so I don‚Äôt come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm just insane. 2) what can I do about these states? Does anyone have any advice on how to avoid them or end them/shorten them? I want to figure out problem solving mechanisms for when it happens again.

So I started getting this at the age of 9. Its sooo hard to explain but I woke up one time and it was almost like i was sleep walking but thoughts were rushing through my head along with abnormal feelings, im pretty sure i was hallucinating too. i went back asleep and woke up the next morning realizing that i had a specific nightmare that was soo traumatic. i think what made it traumatic was the feeling that came along with the dream. Later on in life i starting getting weird thoughts and feelings again it made me so scared, for example, i would just be on my phone and then some type of thought popped up in my head and makes me very scared for some reason even though its an everyday thought. at this point i know im not making any sense but please keep reading. And also keep in mind that these thoughts Weirdly come one year and goes away a month later, then comes back the next year goes a month later. I also realize i get these in the afternoons or night time. Now recently my mother was talking to me, and I got it again, i started freaking out and having those same feelings that i got when i had those weird experiences when i was nine. I dont know if its possible to be traumatized by a dream or something so little, it could maybe be my brain being over active or over heating, because i remember getting the same feelings of thoughts when i had a high grade fever with feverish dreams, and ur brain thinks weird when ur brain is overheated, so that could possibly be why im thinking like this, because my brain could be overheated but then again, why is it happening every year around the same time, please help (p.s im sorry if it made no sense)",22Jun2019,1

I'm having a strange OCD obsession right now and I need help.
So I have OCD and I suspect I have depersonlization disorder as well and I am having a really strange and nonsensical philosophical obsession right now that I am unable to shake and it's driving me insane.

I had a thought earlier today that the reason why there is conflict in the world is because people had different personalities. If everyone had the same personality and likes and dislikes there would be world peace. My brain took this line of logic and now I can't help but think that differing personalities are the root of all evil and being a different person from everyone else a bad thing. Now I have this narcissistic obsession that everyone else is bad for not thinking the way I think makes them bad people because no one should have a different personality than me. And there should be no differences in preferences too because my brain will think if something is good for me than it is good for everyone. If I like eating chicken then everyone else should like it too etc etc.

Now I can't look at other people now without these thouhts running through my head and it makes me want to cry because I know this thoughts are bad thoughts and I try to ignore them but the logic seems sound to me and I unable to explain why I think it is a bad idea other than it feels wrong to me. I knowill it makes me seem like some narcissistic asshole but I can't stop the thoughts or find out why it is a bad idea anyway. Can someone please give me a reality check?",22Jun2019,1

54,"I‚Äôm 31/m with a mixed bag of experiences, but basically they include lows of being abused and mistreated, as well as my negative behaviour and some pretty neat achievements and talents. Most of the terrible things were before I was 18 and I was able to deal with the trauma of childhood by accepting what happened, forgiving, owning up to my mistakes etc. I forget the psychological name for the theory but it‚Äôs sound and people use it for all kinds of trauma. Anyways I did it with a church, it helped, but recently a bunch of events have caused my trauma ‚Äúwounds‚Äù to reopen. 
Specifically, I went to another church ‚Äúemotional health‚Äù course, which was pretty good, once you drop the fluff. But the councillor (he was another student last session- I didn‚Äôt disclose VERY sensitive info but he was tied enough to it)  who I‚Äôve known for years and years later admitted to me he had sexual tendencies towards children. He told me this because he didn‚Äôt want to live a lie, he did the program because he recognizes it is wrong to prey on children and he wants to be open. He never has acted on it. But he was a guide of sorts in this journey I was on in revisiting my traumatic past to deal with it, and when he admitted his tendencies I was repulsed and shocked- I could feel his disgusting feelings sitting across from him as he told me and it fucked with everything from my whole life as those reopened things from my past were along with it. 
 I know I can‚Äôt fault him because he‚Äôs a person who needs to be real. He‚Äôd been hiding this from me for 10+ years and I‚Äôd told him a bit of my stuff. But that really shook my world. I‚Äôve actually never heard something so disgusting and recently developed a more sensitive ability to empathize with people, making it worse. 
 At this point the trauma from this event and other recents are all boiling up and I‚Äôm manic. Pretty much a maniac without killing. I can see it but can‚Äôt control it. I have been for a year since my ex n I split, but now it‚Äôs like everything my whole life is being felt again and I can‚Äôt stop it. I‚Äôm contemplating whether life is worth it because everyone let me down. Worse than that I can recognize this is some weird unhealthy victim mentality but have already exhausted every option i thought I had: 
 - I couldn‚Äôt muscle through it. Though I‚Äôm alive and grades are good, finances and emotions, relationships are a mess 
 - medication makes my skin crawl because of skin problems I have 
- spent thousands on travel didn‚Äôt help 
- therapists wanted hundreds an hour which I can‚Äôt afford now 
I had to quit my jobs because of anxiety and now am attempting to go on workers comp. it feels like asking for a handout but I can‚Äôt live in a manic state anymore. I am taking everything personally because I don‚Äôt feel worth anything. I feel alone and abused with all this opened up. 

I have seen people not come back from trauma and they live the rest of their lives bitter and resentful. I‚Äôm terrified to end up like that, but most of all I usually see the world as a beautiful place and I Have grand dreams and ambitions that are actually possible. I want to trust people and live a normal life but things just all feel so extreme right now and I can‚Äôt even read an academic paper.

55,"I'm obsessed with my professor/mentor, who is a married man in his 50s. Not even primarily sexual. I just long to be a part of his world. And his family.I idolize them. Today I found a pic of the family online (I was cyberstalking) and it made me so *desirous.* I just long for it. For a place to come back to over winter breaks, a place to celebrate holidays, one that doesn't change every year and make me feel like an intruder...

I saw a photo of my professor's wife once. She had most natural, angelic, composed look on her face. Hair back, no makeup, teaching someone to sew. She's like from another era or something. I am total trash by comparison. Broken, fake, tasteless, confused, nervous, lying piece of shit who goes on fucking reddit forums instead of meaningfully connecting with the world or doing something for another human being. She is amazing. Pure. Confident. Reserved. But warm. Simple. Tasteful. *Genuine* in a way I don't think I'll ever be. I feel like deep down she is who I might have been without my mental illnesses.

I just wish I could erase my identity. I am the worst of the worst. I know there are things about my wiring that I cannot change but I cannot accept them. I hate them. And even if I do I would always hate myself for being myself at some point.

I am damaged goods at this point and it's honestly my fault. I've been playing the abused and weak girl role my whole life, even right now, on reddit, I'm continuing to do it. I've come to cling to this role.

I kept thinking that if I suffered enough I'd somehow become better. When I was in middle school I remember writing this ""plan"" in a notebook called ""plan to purposely lower your self esteem."" It included writing a list of everything I hated about myself. I'm the polar opposite of dignified, the polar opposite that beautiful pure woman my professor had the good sense to marry. I should be happy for them but I feel tortured at the moment. I am something people should stay away from, toss to the side, something ugly and black and red inside.

How do I calm down??????? I don't self harm but I feel like it. I won't but I don't know how to handle to anger. I don't know how to self-soothe. A bath is the last thing I want to do and it's too late to walk and I haven't slept in days. I feel so panicky.

Thoughts like that started flooding my head. 

I started wondering if I was a closet racist. 

At the same time, I'd be out helping customers, say, put in a new headlight, and they'd casually mention they had been pulled over 3 times in one night and each time, cops wanted to search their car, but fortunately, they got away without a search because they were illegally carrying guns on them.

And it's concerning her

I think that episode in my life kinda messed up with my head. The first months that i went single were a real nightmare. I had bad dreams every night with that person coming to kill me or saying bad things to me, every time that i heard the person's name i started to feel dizzy and sick. It was just horrible.  
After 2 years, i think i'm better. It's not that bad at it was at the start.   


The problem is: i have some triggers. And from time to time, i freak out and start to have some anxiety crisis or some stuff like that.

I just started to overthinking over some stupid things, some of them aren't even related to my past relationship. I have a feeling that someone is always watching me, or that people know things about me that they shouldn't, i'm feeling bad for having secrets, i'm afraid that people will discover those secrets someday and will hate me or something like that. I'm afraid of having a life on the internet because people will stalk me.   
Those thoughts are getting me crazy. I feel like i'm extremely guilty for something that i didn't do in the first place. That's the best way that i found to explain what i'm feeling. It's like my own existence is wrong and people are always judging me for existing. I just don't know what to do.

64,"I have a 3 year old nephew who was speech delayed for a while. During check ups I think (my sister and his husband is very secretive about this) he was diagnosed of mild autism. He's pretty okay but he tends to get too hyper sometimes and he's also not good accepting no's. He throw tantrums when you say no to him,but you can persuade him sometimes to be okay with it. He also has a tendency to pinch people out of frustration when you say no to him, but he also says sorry after a few minutes.

Lately, he's been really into playing drums and we were all excited about it. My Dad bought him a set to play with and he wants to play with almost all the time. During therapy though, instead of doing activities he tends to do shadow drumming. So the therapist said to dismantle the set and to refrain my nephew from playing for now. I'm wondering if it's the right approach.

Another thing is, my brother-in-law puts my nephew in time out by leaving him in the room without lights and he said it's what's done during therapy. He's also asked not to cry and they have phrases like ""quiet feet"" and ""quiet hands"". How can the kid express himself with that? As someone who grew up bottling my feelings and getting depression due to it. It really makes me feel uneasy. Can somebody enlighten me if these are appropriate methods?

68,"I am a person who struggled with mental issues all of my life - depression, anxiety, PTSD and OCD. I am a person who struggled through many traumas just many other people did, but I am learning how to accept these scars, use them to my advantage, or learn from them or learn how to be above them because the pain never goes away, no matter how long ago it happened and different episodes will require different strategies.

&amp;#x200B;

Being also a graduate of a psychology degree, I am also learning how mental illness was oppressed, shunned and ridiculed with whatever label or stigma you can think of throughout history - crazy, bonkers, unhuman, possessed by demons and so on. And I also learned that the situation of tackling mental illness is not that straight-forward - on one hand, we have more awareness than ever but at the same time, the mentality of how we define people with mental illness have been defined in our culture for so long that it became irreplaceable (plus at the same time, we define and categorise people in different ways and different labels because it is a natural process of how the mind likes to make sense of things. That is why we unconsciously form stereotypes and schemas although we also have to be self-conscious enough of them too) and different cultures constantly come into conflict that eventually breed different interpretations about the same phenomenon and different factors will breed different reactions, problems and other complications. At the same time, I am not quite sure of this awareness does its job because you do get the full view of the illness (which there are many right now) and not everyone will understand it fully unless they have deep knowledge about it or experienced it or consulted a real professional (think of it like when the awareness of global warming happened for decades and nobody cared until the results became more and more drastic).

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I also learned that the phenomenon of mental illnesses is not that straight-forward - what we define as normal or not is ambiguous, what is defined as mental illness is also ambiguous and mostly a social construct (look up Thomas Szazs); and on one hand, the factors that influence mental illness of any kind are quite real like the chemistry in one's neurons affecting one's behaviour, or the background of one's upbringing affecting how one thinks, but at the sme time, your mind and your hearts are telling you to think like that because that is how they are conditioned when in reality, you can be self-awareness enough on how to deal with it (you can safely say that the phrase ""it is all in your head"" can be applied here although in a more practical and functional way than the more negative way as it has been stigmatised for long) and no approach or therapeutic method is 100% correct or infallible so people are so complex, constantly changing and their minds have so much depth that it takes a long time to even treat one person. And yes, some mental illness, no matter how hard people do their best to tackle them, will never really go away and one's struggles can be very overbearing or tricky to handle like schizophrenia, eating disorders, OCD and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I am noticing a lot on how social media and Hollywood LOVES to glorify or romanticise mental illness. On one hand, I see the benefits of this because there are plenty of philosophies out there that mention that struggle makes us stronger and tougher (like Nietzche is basically the patron of viewing sufferring as something necessary and useful in life) and one's inner struggles can be used as a means of individualisation and self-expression like Van Gogh did with his own personal struggles and turned them into art, or Owen Wilfred expressed his angst, sufferring and fear when he fought during WW1. 

&amp;#x200B;

But lately, I have been very, very, very worried that we are taking this glorification or romanticisation of mental illness or any kind of mental struggles too far that it entirely misses the point behind the original mindset behind this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, mental struggles can be useful, educational, tough, and maybe even inspirational. After all, everyone has their own battles, whether big or small, and everyone has to go through struggles in life and some more than others or some eventually develop pathologies. But I am feeling so fed up on how plenty of different forms of fiction love to glorify mental illness or support whatever awareness or more ""progressive"" lifestyle as if it is the current version of marketing to get more views, support or money from viewers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I am starting to feel that that is the case because I grew fed up of films and TV and even comics and video games portray mental illness as another cliched trope to make the person appear more relatable or has some flaw but in reality, it misses the point of the whole sufferring aspect of the mental disorder or struggles, or it alienates the person as well. For example, in the 13 Reasons Why series, many professionals and artists think that portraying suicide as revenge was not a good call of showing the real struggles and explicit details of the issues that teenagers go through (whether real or something that is exaggarated amongst adolescents like the desire to belong or social pressure) that even push them to that limit. Or another example is whatever minority group that the person is identified with but that is the only trait that the character is, as if it is all that we see in him/her but nothing else which completely misses the point of why people still go through some minor micro-aggressions against their culture. One example in particular is when I see things that have the rainbow colour which is an effect to support the LGBT community. You may show to be a supporter of pro-LGBT rights (and yes, aside that I think that all this awareness for more pro-LGBT rights, some countries and cultures still oppress them and stigmatise them), I still do not think that making your profile picture or making a cup with the rainbow colour solves the issue, and neither that protesting or ranting online demanding change. (and yes, there are also the SJW on the internet but I am going to neglect that because that is an extreme version of the so-called ""awareness"")

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, it feels like we are being way too idealistic, or perhaps, if I am being crude, too soft and empathetic to these kinds of struggles. Yes, of course, you need to be empathetic and understand what these people are going through but eventually, they have to get up on their feet, or at least try to, and do something about it or know how they can tackle it, or otherwise, that feeling of being a victim is going to become another label in their mind. (actually I learned this the hard way. There is actually a thing that being too empathetic can be just as stigmatising and unpractical. I am learning this in my current job at a social service centre that it can eventually lead to problems if you do not do some boundaries, and I also learned about the colour blind approach towards racism makes the person just as unempathetic to what other races go through daily)

&amp;#x200B;

One example in particular that I like is from the movie ""Good Will Hunting"" where the therapist truly did understand and really did feel what Will felt but at the same time, he wanted to tell him the same phrase ""what are you going to do?"". A simple quote but powerful at the same time because eventually, even if you want to cry, one day you have to get back up and keep on going.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I get that the awareness is (hopefully) changing the way on how we view mental disorders or mental struggles in general. But I feel that if this kind of approach keeps up, then it basically nullifies what the whole idea of awareness tried to do in the first place.",22Jun2019,17

73,"Hello!

So as the title suggests, I'm having some trouble at the moment.

Firstly, the problem is that at some point during the day, typically the evening I will feel an overwhelming change of about 10 different emotions ranging from nausea to despair to anxious to empty. This will usually occur me to have a bit of a breakdown, for example yesterday I cried and punched my door a lot like the walking talking cliche I am. It typically occurs when I'm not being stimulated enough and am left to my own thoughts. I am currently home for the long, (too) long summer holidays from university. I am living with my parents who I get on with, but we don't hang out, also don't have a job I can distract myself with.

Now I think the overall reason for my head being in the toilet at the moment is that my girlfriend is in her home country and I can't see her. (I do fly over there in 32 days Yay!) Now I love this woman with all my heart and I think this is where my problem truly begins. I think my head is trying to sabotage this good thing and make me think it is going to go wrong. Throughout the day before my fun breakdowns, I have constant flooding visions of us arguing, her screwing up or even us breaking up. Even if I try think of the good times, the bad stuff comes anyway. 

I think there is a reason for this though, It will take too long to explain in full detail but before we were together, a little over a year ago, we hooked up nearly every day for about 3 weeks. She then like she did now went back to her home country. I had every intention of wanting to be with her when she came back but knew she wasn't ready for a relationship. Now last summer I was a victim of Grievous Bodily harm and no one was there for me more than her, I didn't need much comfort but when I did she would give it to me. Fast forward a few months, In late august shes back in the same country as me and we meet up, this is where our feelings start to begin and bada boom bada bing in october we became boyfriend and girlfriend. 

Now, whilst she was away last summer I said to her ""If you want to get with anyone, that is fine"". So basically she did. We have had three conversations about this.

The first: I asked her if she ever did get with anyone, She seems ashamed and doesn't want to go into details, understadnable.

The second: I found out it was more than just making out.

The third: I found out she fucked three guys.

You are probably thinking I am a psycho freak and jealous beyond belief and have no right to be annoyed and guess what because we weren't together so she can do what she wants, it's her body. And you know what... I completely agree with you, that's the crazy thing, I know it is crazy for me to feel anything jealous about it but I still kind of do.

But what fucks me up isn't the actual getting with others, it's the fact that when I was at my lowest, she was flirting with me, keeping",22Jun2019,2
74,"So - I work in the UK for a global brand that is literally seen as one of the biggest in the world in its area.

In the middle of April I had to start taking time off due to my Mental Health, in particular depression and panic attacks.

In May we had an incident where I had to go to hospital as my fianc√© had found me holding one of her razor blades begging her to take it off me before I did something stupid.

I returned to work 3 weeks ago yesterday and was on a phased return where I was working less hours than I normally do with a view to building slowly back up to normal hours. On Monday just gone I had to take another day off as I‚Äôd had a panic attack following an incident where I found myself walking to the kitchen with the intention to get a knife and again do something stupid, once again I‚Äôd managed to stop myself, and returned to work the next day.

Thursday was my day off and I got a call from my boss, stating that H.R. had spoken to the safe-guard team and they felt that they couldn‚Äôt guarantee the support I need in work if I have another panic attack there like the one on Monday and as such until I‚Äôve seen an occupational health specialist next week they don‚Äôt want me to come into work, they also said they‚Äôd ring my fianc√© as next of kin to explain the decision. When they rang her their reasoning was different, not mentioning anything about the worries about the suicidal tendencies of the attacks, just saying it was because I was having panic attacks at work.

I‚Äôll be honest this has been a huge set-back in my recovery, but I‚Äôm also a bit worried now, is there a chance they could fire me on medical grounds? Should I still be getting paid for the shifts I‚Äôm missing and am I reading too much in the differences between what they‚Äôve told me and what they told my fianc√©? Any advice would be helpful as it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve found myself in a situation like this and I feel completely helpless.",22Jun2019,1
75,"20 minutes ago, I googled ""I need someone to talk to,"" because when I feel terrible I tend to do such embarrassing things. This one in particular was because I have no friends, no one to talk to. I figured I should try ringing one of those support things like Samaritans, but I'm very nervous about doing so and had a bad experience the first time I tried, but that's a digression. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw this online support group being advertised, one I didn't think I'd heard of before, so I clicked on it. I was reading through the site, and they have this crisis page, like most sites like this. You know, the ones titled ""What to do if I'm in a crisis?"" or ""I'm in a crisis, help!"" etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The page was pretty standard, but then something caught my eye at the bottom. Usually people tell you, ""You are loved,"" etc. for fear that you are having certain thoughts, but they went several steps further than that, and wrote:

&amp;#x200B;

""Most of all: Always remember that people care about you. People need you around. You are loved. You are needed. NO-ONE is better off without you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple of questions. Are those statements true? If so, how do you know? And if not, is it wise to lie to people when they most likely know (or at least believe) otherwise? I have a hard time feeling like there is someone out there who literally NEEDS me around, and it reeks of the strange, seemingly false hyper-positivism that pervades in many online communities these days. I hope that doesn't sound too political or anything, but I don't find it helpful, but I also would like those statements to be true; I would like to be needed by someone. I just don't think it is true.",22Jun2019,2

Three and a half months ago my wife and I got into a bit of fight, and sh%#t went down the hell.

And I mean it, really really went to hell in a short span of time.

I was really depressed when that happened from other factors before, and when this thing happened, it just exploded in my mind. She wanted divorce, could not take it etc.

I got served with divorce papers in less than 10 days. I was absolutely wrecked, and still am.  


For most of the time it resolved itself as huge physical pain which somehow transferred to physical stiffness.   
I lost 25 kg in month and another 7 after.   
I  didn't sleep well at all. Sleeping 2-3 hours per night, then waking up shaking and in sweat, even tho room is not warm (is cold rather).  


  
I tried going to gym but that didn't help much at all.  
Also, I changed a couple of psychologists (3 of them) who didn't/couldn't help at all. In the end I found psychiatrist who ended up prescribing me couple of pills.  


My question is about getting 2nd opinions on pills and therapy I received.   
\- Sanval - sleeping pills, which were canceled after 7 days on our 3rd session  
\- Lorazepam 2,5 mg - half a pill in the morning, and another half if needed during the  day  
\- Calixta 15mg - I think this is  Mirtazapine in English. She said  it's used to threat depression, and I take it every night 20 mins before sleep.  


They are helping, but I somewhat feel strange as this is the first time that I am taking pills for psychological related stuff.    
It's also kind of weird as I tried not taking Lorazepam for example in the morning, and I all of the previous symptoms would return.

78,"I wanted to post my recent story to help others get early help. I waited till I hit rock bottom to get any help for myself. 

(I‚Äôm on mobile so please don‚Äôt mind spelling errors or weird format)

This past year for me has been really tough. Last December I was baker acted because I lost all hope for myself and I was self harming and isolating myself where I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. I was also on Prozac and it was not helping. Please look out of side effects if you take meds! It‚Äôs taken me 3 med changes to find something that works.

I spent a week in a baker act facility before I was even able to get home. When I got out I realized life is more than it seemed. I finally had a sense of clarity.

Then May 2019 hit me. I had been dealing with bad meds again, getting kicked out, and substance abuse. I tried to kill myself 10 times in the span of 3 weeks. I never told anyone or asked for help when I dealt with these things. I never told anyone how I was feeling. I hit rock bottom.  I know that if I told someone at my first signs of being sad or depressed or helpless, I would have had help sooner. Later on I had a great friend notice I was shaking uncontrollably, and zoned out to where I didn‚Äôt know what was going on. I had tried to overdose the night before. She gave me the ultimatum of me telling my therapist about what I did or she would called the cops on me once I got home. I decided that if she was willing to go to the lengths of getting me help there was some hope of worth left. 

I told my therapist and got baker acted. During my baker act they decided putting me into a residential program would benefit me most. I hated the idea with all my heart and soul. I didn‚Äôt know that that program would save my life. I know that because I had plans to kill myself once I got out of the baker act. 

After a month in the program I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôm safe, and most of all I‚Äôve finally found hope to live.

80,"I started working part-time overnights at a group home for individuals with severe mental disabilities back in May and I've spent every shift sitting in fear trying not to become physically sick (due to anxiety) for the full eight hours. The residents are supposed to sleep during this time but one woman in particular is often up all night, my boss has told me it's my job to try to get her to sleep but if I keep trying to get her to bed she escalates and becomes loud and violent waking up all the other residents in the house. Because the house is so old and poorly built you can hear her pacing in her room all night so even if she is trying to be quiet it wakes up the others which is why I'm supposed to try to get her to sleep. Since I do this shift alone I am afraid of setting her off but I'm also afraid of disappointing my boss by not reinforcing the rules and allowing her to sleep deprive herself and the others. To make matters worse this job was supposed to be every other weekend but their other night person quit right as I was hired and trying to make a good first impression I agreed to working every weekend until they hired someone else. This week I also started a full-time day job so I'm sleep deprived and won't have a single day off until they hire someone else (I've no clue when that will be they were supposed to have someone in by July but I looked at the schedule and I'm in every weekend in July as well).

I try to do relaxation exercises at work but there isn't much I can do when I can't leave, I can't talk to anyone else, and I have to be quiet (normally when I'm anxious I dance or exercise  or go on a walk, all of which are impossible) I become so anxious that I feel too sick to even eat anything and I can't focus on reading or even watching anything. I just don't know what to do. A part of me just wants to quit, I'm not strapped for cash now that I have this full-time job, but I need a position like this to be accepted for grad school. I keep telling myself to just take everything hour by hour, by August I'll be done my probation and maybe I can get moved to days, originally I was going to stick with this job until September 2020, but I don't know how I can keep doing this, I literally count down the seconds until I can leave each morning and have nightmares during the week about being at work. I try to just push through it and when I'm not at work it doesn't seem too bad but when I'm there it all goes downhill. At one point I really thought I would vomit tonight and didn't even know what I would do if I really did throw up, I'm the only person there, I can't just tell my supervisor I've been sick and leave, I also wouldn't even have a way of getting home because buses don't run that early in the day. I try to debrief with my coworkers when they come in in the morning but they just tell me to follow the behaviour plans and that it's often like this and it's just a matter of waiting out the storm. 

So yeah, I've just been up 28 hours straight, I'm writing this instead of sleeping because I'm too wound up to actually sleep. Would be very thankful for any advice or help, perhaps some suggestions on how to stay calm when at work, advice from anyone else who's ever been in a similar situation. I don't know, I just feel really helpless about all of this and I'm mad at myself for making such a big deal out of it when everyone else seems to be capable of doing this job, like what am I doing wrong that I'm struggling to this degree and other people have worked for this organization for 28 years?",22Jun2019,1

A guy i spoke with sometimes asked to me if i wanted to join him in his training. He did calisthenics and i finally felt in love with a sport.

So why do i feel so empty, i'm really lost at the moment. Yesterday i had drunk 5-6 beers to end the week at the work and when i was riding home (bike) i felt like i was going to cry. I went to a spot under a bridge, where no one ever comes and everything came out. I cried and i'm pretty sure i was having a mental breakdown. 

Im not used to having friends, having an activity that i love and a nice job. Everything on paper is finally perfect. The ending of a missarable saga where i only gamed and went to school. Yet, i still feel like shit and that i have no purpose in life.

95,"I have no idea what illness I have but I thinks it's ocd or anxiety, idk please help. I'll clear it out.

I'm at my parents house since it's summer vacation and mostly I stay in my own room. My mind has made this pattern of ""checking"" that I have everything in-place and I haven't misplaced anything or just moved something somewhere else where it doesn't belong. I tried my best to put it out but I'll tell you what exactly I think. I have a bed, a study table, a sofa(of some sorts) and a cupboard(other things aren't necessary). So I have a pattern in my mind that my sofa will always be empty, my study table should not have anything except my younger brother's stuff, my bed should have a bag and chargers in one part of the bed; the other side should have my laptop, mouse and 2 wires(all together always if not I'm forced to keep them together to ""satisfy"" myself). And some other minor stuff. I keep checking if all these things are in their respective places or if not they drive me wild.

That was just one of the things that idk why I do but there's a lot so this post will probably be a long one. I started playing a video game skyrim 2 days ago and everyday Idk what I feel but I feel like I missed something and I need to start the game all over again.

Before that I'd like to talk about another ""ritual"" that I'm forced to do whenever I open my laptop. It's not something like if I stop doing it, that would be it and it'd solve the problem, I feel like I HAVE to do it and only then I'll be satisfied. I boot up windows.and I find myself in an endless loop of doing this: /((opening the this pc(my computer shortcut) shortcut on my desktop and closing it immediately without doing anything and refreshing the screen (right click- refresh) for 2 times and then opening this pc and then closing it immediately and refreshing it again))/ I do this for like 10-15 times till when I feel ""satisfied"" and feel like that ""yeah now the windows is usable and I will be able to use it"".

Now today I restarted playing skyrim from the beginning and idk how to put this. I'll just plainly tell you what I did. I double clicked the game. The game starts. There is a like a 1 sec loading screen and I'm in the game. So this is the part that drives me crazy. Im loaded in the menu and I keep left clicking the mouse like rapidly as fast as I can and I try to explain myself what I'm doing. ""the elder scrolls 5- skyrim. The elder scrolls 5 skyrim. I'm playing skyrim. Skyrim. Skyrim. Skyrim."" I keep doing it until I feel ""confident"" (oh and btw i keep clicking my mouse too while chanting this). Now i click like 5-6 more times and say skyrim. Skyrim. And then I literally read every option the game has like- new, load, settings, add ons, mods, etc etc. Then I decide to click on new. And fast forward a bit, I go through tutorial and I have some stuff and I'm in a town/village area (open world) I have like a lot of stuff like 6 different swords, many different apparels, a variety of food materials and a lot of stuff. You can talk to people in this game and when you go to talk to someone you have like a list of questions that you can ask. I'm forced by myself to ask each and every question and after that going to someone else and doing the same. Then after some time I think like AM I REALLY SURE I ASKED ALL THE QUESTIONS? am I sure? So I go to everyone else to check if I did and of course I did. Then I have like 40 items in my inventory and I go to the trader he has like 100 item to sell and I can sell my items. I feel it very very difficult to sort it all out and sell my stuuf, decide on buying something form the trader and when I'm done, I re check over and over and over again. Also you can pick up a lot of things in the game so wherever I go I keep looking at each and every corner for something and keep rechecking whether or not I might have missed something. Idk if I was clear or not but it was something like this.

I have many other instances that I'd like to share but it takes a lot to type it all out and I'll be there in the comments. Please help. :)",22Jun2019,5
96,"I am 16 (male), and for the past 4 years or so I have been pretending to have several mental illnesses for no reason. 

For the longest time in doing this, I've never felt any guilt or even recognized that what I was doing is wrong. Only in the last few weeks, I have started to feel guilt for lying all the time. At that point, I told myself I would stop lying about all of this, but that didn't happen, and arguably it got worse.

I still don't know why I do it, and when I lie I don't feel guilty. In fact I barely realize I'm doing it. But after the fact, I do feel guilt, but I don't know what to do.

I do want to get better and come clean, but I think that if I do I'd lose everyone I know now. While some people wouldn't care, others certainly would, and there is at least one friendship which was started because I ""had"" a mental illness. I don't know how to get out of this rut, and even though I try to stop lying I keep doing it anyway.

I started therapy a while ago. I have no real timeline because when your existence comprises of waking up in bed and staying in the same position all day and night, your days all meld together and before you know it 2 weeks have passed. My ""official"" diagnosis is anxiety &amp; depression, although I was diagnosed 4 years ago &amp; haven't seen a psychiatrist since despite my symptoms getting a hell of a lot worse. 


This is as the title says. I am 20 (female, not that it matters) and I honestly am starting to feel my life is ruined, I'll never be happy &amp; never lead a normal life. I have developed agorophobia so severe I can't even go into my own front or back garden. Cars terrify me - what if they swerve off the road and hit me? What if they stop and someone abducts me? Planes terrify me. What if it comes crashing out the sky and lands right on top of me? What if the plane has been hijacked and is about to explode this very second and kill thousands? What if that plane is about to drop a bomb right on my very location? *People* terrify me, and this is something that has gotten progessively worse in around 6 months. I trust absolutely no one. I have  lost the ability to make eye contact with people (something I used to be good at) because I feel endangered if I look someone in the eyes. I am scared of my own friends &amp; family. Medication has never helped me and even if it did, I'm too fucking scared to take it. What if I overdose? What if I just drop dead? What if I start seizing and no one is there to help me? What if I become hopelessly addicted and lose myself further to a substance that isn't helping me? I have boxes of medications piled up because no one takes my fear seriously, and they continue to prescribe it. ""Just take it. You know it's safe, you *need* to take it!!"" are not comforting or encouraging words to hear when looking at a pill brings about a primal fear that I can't even put into words.


I am so scared of leaving my own bedroom that I just don't. I go weeks without showering and will only use the bathroom when I am about to cause a bladder infection. I can't stand bumping into my family in the hall ways of my own home. I am incapable of building or maintaining meaningful relationships because I am just too scared of people.


I'm just scared. My existence revolves around me being fucking terrified of everything. And now I'm scared because I am entitled to 8 sessions of therapy; I am half way through and it has made absolutely no difference to me. I'm scared that despite fighting for therapy for a long time now, it's actually not going to help at all and I'll be stuck inside 4 walls listening to intrusive thoughts playing on a loop in my disordered brain for the rest of my miserable existence. 


For the first time ever, I am starting to believe this is what the rest of my life will look like. And I am starting to believe that there is no hope; I'm too far gone. I don't want it to be true though. I want to have friends, I want to go outside, I want to work &amp; enjoy my life. But how the fuck do I start now? 


I am following the system flawlessly, or at least to the best of my current ability. I have a support worker, I do exposure therapy, I do all the exercises and work my therapist tells me to do. But nothing is changing, if anything I feel my mental health issues are escalating. But I don't know what the flying fuck to do about it.

Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been depressed about regrets about the past. Since I was 15 I have romancing about the past. At 21 I thought I was too old. Now at 35, I have massive regrets about things I did not fulfill in my teenage years and in my 20s such as:

&amp;#x200B;

Girlfriends (beating my up for not taking chances at meeting girls, I  had massive social anxiety). Since then I have had no relationships in life.

\- My Autism ( I have all my life had difficulties with social interactions) I‚Äôm beating myself up for finding out so late in my life that I had high functioning autism

\- Regrets over career opportunities; Basically I could have got a semi-successful career in music. However, I still have it has a hobby and things are going this way.

\- Age: I think I‚Äôm too old  at 35 to fix all of the above issues. And hat I have wasted my life.

\- Risks; taking risks and letting go of fear, because I feel now that regrets are forever.

\- Caring too much about what other people say: basically, I was influenced too much about friends and society

\- Depression; my life long depression has been the cause of my Diabetes 1 and Autism.

&amp;#x200B;

My life at the moment is pretty good, I have started to fix issues of the above. But I still have these reoccurring regrets from time to time.

&amp;#x200B;

I have started meditating to get these thoughts out of my head.

Quite quickly I started believing them, starting to believe I wasn't enough, my grades started gradually dropping and I became what I always was told I were, a failure.

i was never able to make any friendships in elementary school, or even up until this year (im 17, going on 18 and this year ive just began making close friends that i am not anxious around). in elementary school, i never talked to anyone, never partnered up with classmates for group activities - i always said that i ""preferred to work alone"", even though i was actually just too shy to talk to other kids. I would hide in the alleyways between classroom buildings during recess.  My entire family, aunts uncles cousins siblings, always asked me why i had no friends, and i never really had an answer for that question. but you can bet my dad sure did. stop being so fucking annoying! thanks for the advice dad!



I think that this mental baggage has really prevented me from having any sort of courage to talk to my peers.

So I started to know something was up when some random joins and pours his fucking heart out to this girl and asks her out and she fucking throws him out. Anyways fast forward to July and her best male friend who I fucking hated at the time (Tristan, My best friend now) tells me to watch out and that mia is manipulating people and talking bullshit about people but anyways a few days later I get on overwatch and ask her what the go with Tristan is and she says god knows what bullshit but the next day I get on she was ignoring me or some shit so her cousin tells me it was that I called her a bitch and she hates me. So I did whatever but the next day all the Titanfall friends I made are talking shit. So I don't remember the in between but I when on to my mates account (acting like him) and asked her some questions she said that she never even liked me and that we were never even friends and I don't know why but that cut me fucking deep also what Tristan was referring to was she told everyone that he was desperate for her (he is 2 years older than us) and that he was a pedo and asked her out via Facebook (lies).  Then a few months later I invited her to a party to try and clear the air and I used an unnecessary insult after I found out her father was unemployed and played a lot of her ps4 and had read our chat (with nothing inappropriate) but anyways she then told me that I was an asshole and that her dad was dying of cancer. I told her that I was so sorry and that if she was lying I would know because I was still in contact with Trevor who I had just found is her only male cousin but she swore. That night I found out how deep she had hurt me. I drank 2L of coke and played UNO on ps4 until 8 am crying myself to sleep with a broken controller (and I don't ever cry). One day I catch with Trevor and ask him if his uncle was dying and he said no and left. fast forward two months into easter time 2018 after I had just lost my ps4 for 2 months (that story is in another Reddit post) and I get a random Friend request from let's call him Gabe. So Gabe (i later found out Gabe was her older brother) joins the party and immediately goes off his fucking nut and yells ""listen cunt stay the fuck away from my family and stop spreading shit you pathetic cunt, Trevor had a fucking panic attack because of you"" he leaves and I put the pieces together and realize Trevor had a panic attack after he thought his uncle was fucking dying and it wasn't even my fault but I wasn't gonna tell him that so I just took it. No bullshit 15 minutes later he joins back and goes ""hold on were you friends with (Mia's PSN account), oh sorry mate, just coming to check if you are all good I went pretty fucking crazy, anyways catch ya"" so then I thought some more Trevor must have mentioned that I said to him that she had told me that and then it must have bitten her in the ass. 

I Haven't spoken to her, Trevor, Tristan or my other friend from the story in over a year that will be a common occurrence here fading away, its always sad to outgrow something especially friends but that doesn't stop the pain.

(Chapter Two: The rise and fall of WastedWallabie)
This chapter starts with 2 of my cousins Kayne, 18 this year, and Rico a year older than me. Rico is basicly in every chapter exept the final one (we are all of different mothers). Kayne first introduced me to youtube Everyday we watched nigahiga and never stoped laughing 
When we played BO2 we would act like youtubers. it was both of our dreams all we wanted. over time we grew apart he was always busy his family started skiping out on Cristmas avioding us to the point where i havent seen him faace to face since 2015 and we live in the same fucking town. It hurts to miss someone especially when you have almost forgotten completely what they sound, act and looked like, He was my idol, my best friend, my mentor. Skip to Late 2016 me and my best friend Casey (VERY SIGNIFANT IN THE FINAL CHAPTER) found out that you could upload and recored clips on your ps4 we flipped so exited we streamed minecraft for hours, this was the birth of my genuine reason for life WastedWallabie. my channel grew and grew reaching just under around 80 subs by its death It meant the world to me people in person just called me wallabie.
I remember the night it struck me i was in a party with Tristan (chapter 1), casey with a few others of my best friends recording my 30 subscriber special, all i remeber thinking is you've made it and that was when i was finally happy, but little did i know my first year of highschool was going to be one hell of a fucking ride and without question the worst year of my life.

(Chapter Three: The worst year of my life)
 
Part One: The fall of wasted wallabie 
(OG post https://old.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8u9ded/should_i_continue_my_dream_at_risk_of_destroying/)

DISCLAIMER: Most of this part is a copy paste from the OG post i made not long after this story took place so the wrighting style is differnent to this one now

So Kayne had been watching my vids and supporting from the sidelines for a long time at this point (this takes place over about 2 week in FEB 2018) Kaynes mother found my youtube, its a small town (and even my fathers mother was getting phone calls saying that they loved my videos) She was not to pleased to say the least so what happened was she called my grandmother to tell my parents to delete my channel. So my granpa came over and suggested they take a look at what I had. (this happend on australia day 2018) So I had to delete 600+ hours of content, however, my dad saw that I had loved doing this and that it made me happy so he let me continue, but one thing leads to another (and also I feel like I need to mention that the tip was Anonymous at the time) and I get a warning from my parents about another phone call as I had just released a trolling compilation were they flipped my words around and made me seem like i told a kid to kill himself. So i made a video talking about how I was quitting youtube because some grown human is scouting a 13 yo's youtube videos for bad words and I also said to get a fucking life. Then Rico calls me and tells me that he had to take his entire channel down so we agreed to cut the shit and texted Kayne and ask him if he knew anything about this when he took a whole 30 minutes to reply with no. then I made a spelling mistake and said ""u did it take you so long"" (it was meant to be Y, not U and I made that clear within seconds) his reply was and I quote ""shut up you little turd stop accusing me you mabey it was for the best"" so I jokingly replied with Did you just play yourself he then calmed down and said he was going to go play PUBG, two hours later my mum gets a text ""Will you both be home tonight? I would like to talk to you about Wasted accusing Kayne for dobbing on him and Rico, I was actually sitting with Kayne while he was texting them both! I'm not impressed!!!!!!!!!"" 

So they came over and told them that an aboriginal man walked up to them at work and said ""if you don't sort this out, there's gonna be a problem"" (which i later found out to be bullshit) while locked myself in my room playing Texting my tristan (this was funnnily enough the last time we spoke) after like 40 minutes my parents made me delete the entire channel and I was grounded for 2 months without a laptop, ps4, switch no communication with anyone else other than school (Ill talk about school in the next part) i was fucking misarable I only saw Rico a few more time in 2018 (December 7 being the last time ive seen him to date) 

Part 2: Adam (Feel free to skip)
Before diving into Going into high school i need to bring up a few People here is the main cast for this part and the rest of this entire post Casey and were close from grade 3 onward I was kinda that kid before i met him my only other friends had just left the town or school and even then we were only really friends so we wouldn't look lonely. So casey was a a genuine friend and one of the most loyal guys i have ever met just a stand up guy, He would do anything for his friends his only flaw is that he is to loyal to the next charater in our story the only vain of my existance other than growing up His name will be Adam. Me and Adam were good friends until grade 6 that is, you see for a very long time i had the biggest crush on a girl called futaba not long after i told Adam about futaba he began to try and get with her. He was trying to start a competition over her and me and casey were not happy. We told futaba about his how all she was to him was competition. She said she hated him. now lets have a little jump in time futaba had known there was a competion over her for a long time and now we were on school camp everyone was hooking up. in other words she knew we would be trying extra hard we kinda gave up after a while but aparently they dated in secret to not hurt me i didn't care this part isn't exactly relevant but consider it charater development for Adam. Now lets jump to the final weeks of primary school when had another crush on a girl called Makoto well turns out by pure coincidence that adam had also liked makoto so once again competion started. the last night of primay school all the popular kids had a party (a ton of girls incluing makoto and our clique i guess me, adam and a few other friends) i told makoto i liked her and i got a smile i guess but of course as soon as i said it he did everything in his power to make her like him more than me this pissed me off (he did this later to jace) so i vowed with casey that we wouldn't put up with Adams bullshit anymore. but little did we know we had much more  Adam to endure. 

(Part Three: High school, child porn and an awful lot of context)
On the first day of high school all three of us sat anxiously waiting to see our homerooms (in our school you have all your classes with your homeroom) we were all seperated but I knew one kid in my homeroom Jace Inskip we met in primary for a year and we didn't exactly mix well we have very different personalitys little did i know with out jace I might now be here writing this post. So we kinda had to stick together during class but he also knew Adam and casey during primary so we had an alright time they kinda carried me through the events of part one of this chapter. lets jump ahead to around march barley 2 month after the youtube incedent we were all playing fortnite when adam say out of the blue ""Do you want to see a picture of my balls?"" (pretty sure he is gay for other reasons aswell) not beliving he would i said ok whatever surely enough I get a pic and im like what the fuck, then no one belived me so I sent it to a chat with rico who then sent it to jace (we weren't as close as we are now) who sent it to another who added 32 people. we all tried to defuse the situation spamming the chat with other shit while Adam cried STOP IT.  it was then adam instead of letting us defuse the situation which was working told his fucking mum who called mine AND RICOS needless to say we all had everything taken again after all that bullshit less than 3 months ago I had to now deal with this bullshit adam was also very afraid he wouldn't be popular at our high school anymore so we kept it underwraps for him (big mistake)
Next thing i now im at the cop shop talking about how now im on caution on child exploitive material (child porn) so yea no good fam.
That night we told adam to get on playstation and he refused this happend so many nights in a row that we began to get sus af so we check his epic account active so we asked him to get on we got the usual so i shot him a message it when along the lines of 
""Listen if your trying to dodge us then i cant do anything about that but high school changed you now all you cared about is your gay insta followers and how many kids like your posts"" BTW it was a common meme to make fun of adams mum for looking like pornstar  he did not like that it made him rage even though it was ok to call everyone elses mum names so he joins are party after we faked reporting his account, He lost it me rico, jace just took the piss out of this angry little faggot he was yelling i wish i had have fucking choked you through your car window then he told me that he was gonna get his mum to tell my mum that i called her a pornstar so i said ""bruh lol littile bitch gonna cry to mummy"" He then blocked my everything insta, ps4 you name it no contact he would consistantly aviod me at school and due to him blocking me on ps4 i could very rarely speak to or play with casey and everyone else all i had was jace.

But anyways cut to friday night i called him a bitch and to talk shit to my face (he didn't look me in the eyes the whole time) he went out  with casey meaning i couldn't really see him they later ditched him as soon as he lost his phone leaving me and jace to help find it.

Now for last night
(Chapter Four: Last night)
The final chapter 

Today began with me finishing RE2 leaving me reluctant to get on my ps4 when jace called me. We played dead by daylight for like an our until we got an invite from casey to a party so we join and all play minecraft, adam had got off an hour ago so casey wanted to spend time with us. My dad called me out to get my washing and as i whent out a saw a shooting star (told you it was like a movie) as i came back inside we played some more and honestly im struggling to write this part as it all hit me so fucking quickly but somehow casey mentioned he has leaving to go to another school. I muted everone but jace and began to cry. Casey for a long time was all I had my bestfriend who would do litteraly anything for me, Adam was leaving with him and so were some other kids I knew. They were all leaving at the end of the term (1 week) Most kids knew this but not me thats how seperate me and jace are from our school. The only reason we didnt know was becuase we had remained seperate from adam due to the fact that we didnt want to make casey choose so because of how Fucking retarded and selfish Adam was he also blocked jaces phone on caseys iphone so we had lost most communication with him even though we would sometimes talk at school when adam whent to piss or just fucked off 

So i knew this would be one of my last with casey sadly he fell asleep not long after i found out he had no clue i didnt know so yea im going to have a very lonely 2020 but ithink ill make it through feels good to get this off my chest but i still know that me and casey will seperate over time and our relationship will fade like so many others have I know that sometimes people just move on people change but its still painful as fuck

Thanks for reading my fucking novel 
Your nigga, WastedWallabie",22Jun2019,0
119,"Please bare with this long text and take the time to read, this is very important : 

I was feeling very depressed and suicidal in the moment, so I decided to take action and call a hotline. A woman named Sydney answered the phone. I began to explain why I felt suicidal. There was an incident where I accidentally creeped out a woman, and I really felt terribly bad. I‚Äôm a good guy, who has no bad intentions to hurt women and any way. I‚Äôm very respectful, and I voice myself in a respectful way. I never lost my cool on sydney. I was talking to her respectfully and calm. This situation made me feel so terribly bad that I was so depressed.

This woman named Sydney began to turn my issues and problems to an argument about gender, and began to belittle me on why since I‚Äôm a man, I‚Äôve never experienced the pain and fear of a woman. I told her that I sympathize with the fear of women, because I too have been threatened before. I have almost had my life being taken, and also almost been assaulted. She told me that what I have felt in life is not the same as what a woman goes through. She was arguing with almost everything I was saying to her since the start of our conversation. I felt hopeless.

At this point not only was I suicidal, I felt like maybe even doing it. This woman who was supposed to comfort me in my last resort, argued with me, insulted me, and belittled me. She called me misogynistic. How the hell that it turned to that made no sense. I explained to her that I wasn‚Äôt trying to make this call about gender, that I only wanted to talk about my suicidal problems. I just wanted to voice myself on why I felt so terrible for creeping out a woman . I was so hurt. I felt like actual garbage, and I‚Äôm a strong man. 

I took what she said as motivation to keep myself safe that night. Sydney made me feel so crappy about myself, but being a strong person, I pushed through and stayed safe.

But I‚Äôm not okay. What she said was honestly one of the most hurtful things that has ever happened to me. To anyone who genuinely thinks that what Sydney was saying was right, I forgive you. I think that women‚Äôs rights are important. But take that aside from the fact that I was suicidal. She belittled me and it felt as if she almost did not care about my safety, when I was in need of help. I felt like I was being attacked in the moment. I tried to reason with her, and she kept arguing with me. She hurt me so bad.  I wanted help terribly bad. 

I ended up explaining to her that she made me feel more suicidal, and hung up on her. I called another woman named Karen who was very helpful, and I explained to Karen what Sydney said, and Karen was shocked. She tried to help get my voice up to higher management in the National Suicide Hotline, so something could be done.

This is my honest truth. I‚Äôm not here to make up lies, and to talk politics. I here to support mental health. I‚Äôm here to talk about why this matter is so serious. Nobody who is suicidal deserves be belittled by a hotline which is supposed to prevent them from killing themselves. Nobody deserves to be told what I was told by Sydney. 

Please help me get the word out there. This is not okay. If you care about mental health, then help me out.",22Jun2019,40
120,"So basically about a year and a half ago I began to have problems with understanding things, being able to read people or social situations and having normal conversations. I would say this was extremely severe. I felt totally cut off from reality, with no thoughts, feelings and the prevailing feeling that I‚Äôd lost myself. I felt like a moron and struggled with every single task set for me and kept losing jobs which I couldn‚Äôt carry out since I was struggling with what people were saying/asking me to do. Everything seemed weird and it was like I wasn‚Äôt able to tell anything about anyone or anything. I began to hate my life and cried. I felt my life was over. No matter what I tried I could never feel normal and always felt insignificant, retarded and like a complete waste of space.  
  
Then I applied for a pharmacy position. I don‚Äôt know why I did as I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that job since I struggled with everything but I guess I felt positive that night. I got an interview and later I got the job. For some reason when I had the interview I was able to understand more than usual and managed to understand the questions being asked. After the interview things went back to the depressing norm. After being accepted I panicked and felt there was no way I‚Äôd be able to do it. My mother thought differently and told me to go (throughout the past 1.5 years she was convinced that my problem was fixable and that I needed to challenge my brain through crosswords and memory tests - I did a little but felt too hopeless and struggled with understanding the puzzles‚Äô instructions anyway).  
  
I worked for 4 months there hating every second, worrying every minute and feeling incompetent every day. I was traumatised. I was unable to understand basic things, had to ask for help with everything and forgot everything that was told to me and also had a boss who wasn‚Äôt that keen on me. At home my situation wasn‚Äôt ideal and I needed to to pay rent. My mother recently found a tumour and my grandfather had to have a leg amputated. My uncle hated his life and was suicidal and my brother was depressed. I literally felt there was nothing I could do as I was such a pointless and incompetent waste of space and the stress increased. Every day was hell and sleep was the only respite.  
  
I had been smoking cigarettes and weed since the age of 16. Before this recent turn of events I was an intelligent, inquisitive, funny and charming guy. But I couldn‚Äôt recognise me in the mirror anymore. I didn‚Äôt know who I was anymore. I turned to drugs and took an ecstasy pill to feel some form of happiness. I had a bad trip. Heard voices, felt things were moving and very upsetting imagery prevented me from falling asleep. I felt that I had lost my mind and didn‚Äôt sleep for the entire night. Work the next day was murder. Things were already bad but now they were horrific. As the shifts rolled by my condition got worse. A bright light would suddenly appear in front of me, people‚Äôs eyes looked crazy/angry, I had paranoid thoughts and things appeared not real and I kept losing myself to the point where I broke down crying complaining to my mum that I had lost myself and that I had lost my mind. We dropped into emergency care, I was diagnosed with psychosis and depression and given anti-depressants. Later I saw a psychiatrist and prescribed anti- psychotic medication too. I have been on meds for a month.  
  
My current situation - I have constant panic attacks, worry all the time and the prevailing feeling I have is that I have lost myself and don‚Äôt know who I am. I cannot concentrate or talk much or look at things for too long as I don‚Äôt feel like myself and when that happens is when I feel I‚Äôve lost my mind. I HAVE to feel like myself. It is like I am watching myself from others‚Äô points of view and seeing what others see. I‚Äôm not experiencing how a person ought to be experiencing things - how I experience things. I can‚Äôt look at myself in the mirror or my own shadow - I cannot describe to you how difficult this is. If I do and for too long and try to think about who I am I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. It is hard to describe but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve lost myself and I‚Äôm constantly trying to feel like myself without analysing things too much but I feel that things are now way too crazy, unlivable and just horrendous. The tablets haven‚Äôt really changed much. The psychiatrist I saw diagnosed me with an unspecified psychotic disorder. My mum‚Äôs online research brought her to the additional diagnosis of depersonalisation/derealisation disorder. Shit is scary. I have tried explaining that I cannot do anything anymore and I am constantly breaking down crying. Constantly feel that I‚Äôve lost my mind/losing my mind. Mum forced me to go saying it will be good for me and is good for my brain. Feel like I‚Äôve reached the end of the road and shouldn‚Äôt have to take this anymore. Things were awful before but now with the crazy shit have reached a different, more depraved level of torment and despair. It is like I am being tortured.  
  
Just wanted to know what others thought about this condition and if they had words of advice or could just chime in with some opinions to do with my personal story of hell. Cheers.",22Jun2019,1

122,So I have been having problems for a few months the last few days have been very hard. Today I had the courage to write a letter to ask my parents for help. I know it‚Äôs scared them and they are worrying about that I‚Äôve told them. But it feels to much better to share.,22Jun2019,4
123,"Ever since I started working(5yrs), I became a very angry person especially lately. What is the worst part that I take it out on my boyfriend. He's my first serious relationship, he's 31, I'm 28 and I feel like he is the right one. We have been together for almost 3 years, living together for a year. Unfortunately I think we argue at least once a week because I just break down and keep being angry and cry. It feels like everything I hated about my parents when growing up, I am now doing to him - the need to tell him what to do, how to dress, being angry that he didnt do something immediately after I have asked for it. I feel like I am becoming a terrible person and he needs to put up with it. I feel insecure that he doesn't love me as much anymore even though he is touching me all the time. That is however one of the parts that makes me angry cause sometimes I just need someone to comfort me and hug me and he just keeps touching my boobs or something and I already told him that there are moments where this really feels he's only after my body but this guy is really the most genuine person I have ever met and I guess this is just the way he expresses himself and he does apologize when I tell him that that wasn't the right moment but he just keeps doing it. I have had unfortunately a traumatic experience when I was a kid and my cousin was touching me sexually. This is actually the first time ever I am writing this somewhere, but I always thought I was dealing with it just fine cause even though I want to cut that bastard's balls off everytime I see him , I never had issues like having sex with my partner or anything but lately I have been wondering if this could be partial cause. I am seeing a psychiatrist but didnt tell her about this, this is just something I won't ever tell anyone. I am on some light anti-depressants but I don't think they are helping, I also told that to the doctor, she told me to continue for another month and we will see. But I feel like she is underestimsting what I am feeling cause she is basically just telling me that she thinks I am fine. It is partially my fault as well cause I do not think I keep telling her everything cause I just can't. Lately I have been also having that irrational fear of something happening to me or people close to me, I am scared of driving, I am afraid I would crash the car on purpose even though I do not think I would ever do that. I told her about the fear, not the car crashing, she did not find it significant. So I am wondering if I might have OCD as well or if this really could be all normal? Does anyone have similar story? I also kinda feel like my brain wants me to suffer and not be happy, like finally after years I find my soulmate and it feels like I just need to keep destroying it.

124,"I'm tired, so tired, my strength is flagging, my feet are dragging, I dont know if I have the strength to do this, to continue on this path. 

But then I find a reason to laugh, to smile, to sing or to dance, I'm not very good but it gives me a chance. 

The journey I'm on takes a long time, it may never end, but it will be so worth it, and I know I deserve it. The journey I'm on has a name, recovery, and it's such a difficult thing to attain. It doesnt progress like you think it should, and often, it's not understood. 

People dont often see the silent struggle, how hard I try, how I keep going when it seems I just want to cry. But the little things give me the strength to carry on, watching the sunrise at dawn, seeing a dog walking my way, catching a glimpse of that elusive bluejay, seeing the leaves dance on the breeze, and so I say to others starting this journey, please.

Please dont give up, I see you too, I know how hard this is to do, old ways bring comfort, you know what to expect, getting better is scary, and it's easy to think you need to be perfect. But any progress is good, even if it's small, so please, stand tall. Stand tall in the knowledge that you have taken the chance at this journey, recovery is a twisting, winding, confusing road to travel on, but you can do it, we can do it together, we can do it in poor or fair weather.

125,"I can't describe the sense of absolute euphoria I'm feeling. The world is bathed in a golden glowing amber and I just want to sit and stare at the beauty of my surroundings even if I'm in a plain room. 

This is becoming dangerous for me, I pull out in front of cars and drive too fast as I feel like I can't get hurt. I drink lots and just laugh like crazy even more than normal. My friends have asked me if I'm on drugs but I'm not, everything is just fucking amazing I can't articulate this. I've done no work for my exams next week, I sit in the moment, overwhelmed with glee and ecstasy and read books for hours, just entranced by these novels.

126,"I hope this isn't too much. I've been going through a rough time with my mental health. Had a friend I knew kill himself late last year and didn't find out until recently, then I found out that my Grandfathers cancer that seemed to get better turn out to be total organ failure (which I didn't find out until 2 months after everyone else in the family was told) and then one of my only childhood friends had just died a few days ago, either by suicide or she was murdered. I'm not doing okay.

I've still got my rock in my life, my fianc√©, who I love immensely. However I've found myself lashing out emotionally at him and I hate it. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to shut down and build walls again and I don't want to do it anymore. I can't. I don't want to hurt him like this.

I've been considering going around other subreddits and trying to be more open in complimenting other redditors accomplishments since I've heard that, in turn, that can make me happier as well. My only fear is that it might seem fake or be misunderstood but I don't know what else I can do.

hes going through it the past couple months, hes on disability and doesnt get a lot of money, just enough for bills and a little extra for the whole month. he has bad teeth problems and needed dentures but they were recommending implants, it was too expensive for him so he said no but he was telling his brother about it (who is a millionaire) and he offered to pay for them. so my dad went ahead and did it. 

a few months ago my uncle randomly stopped putting in the money for it. my dad asked him why and he claims he never said he would pay for all of it and was just helping him out. my dad was furious, he wouldnt have done it if he said that in the first place. my uncles pretty f‚Äôed up for other family situations too. so since then my dad has been using his extra money to pay it off and is really broke. its taken a big toll on his life because he cant do anything and is so depressed. he takes it out on my mom and is just always so angry and in a bad mood, he turns into a monster. i would want him to go to therapy but he‚Äôll reply saying he doesnt have money for that or something. idk what to do. its affecting my parents relationship and being the only child left in the house i have to watch listen and be involved and its stressful.

132,"I'm looking for reputable online self-assessment tools that I can use to find out if my mental health concerns are something I should talk to a doctor about. I have taken a few online quizzes that ask some pretty leading questions about personality disorders and seem to act as a self-affirmation tool. While I am concerned by my results with these tests, I would like to find something a bit more reliable before I take the plunge and seek help with what seems to be a serious personality disorder.

Thanks!",22Jun2019,3
133,"Im (21M) 6'4 240lb there is very few things in this world that faze me. But this last 6 months has been hell. It has broken me mentally and physically. I have had non stop problems since the end of December and nothing seemed to go my way. just one thing after the other kept going wrong. It just seemed like ther was no ducking end to it!.
But i stood tall. I faced it all and it seems like i was beating buck the beast. this was largely due to support i got from this (18F)girl i dated. However we broke up 2 months ago and im not gona lie that broke me. Its like i lost my last strong hold. And i just went spinning. That first month after absolutely crushed me. Before this the worst mental problems i had was a headache. But now I had a voice in my head screaming ""I WANNA DIE I WANNA DIE I WANNA DIE""...... Luckily it seems im to stubern to die. Thank god for that. Now I've started standing again and facing the beast again. im still pushed into a corner but im gaining ground. Things are starting to look better. So why the duck can't i stop thinking about her?. even though im the one that broke up with her even though i know it would have never worked even though Im moving to the other side of the country! And probably won't se her again in years!.WHY CAN'T I STOP THINKING ABOUT HER?!. Im tired......

I'm not sure if it's just stress, which has been a big issue since then. Although it's been a problem that I'm still dealing with I believe I have made major improvements. I was not addicted or anything, just took a step down the wrong path. I was depressed the whole summer afterwards, but towards the end of August I had found a few hobbies that pulled me out.

i WANT to go, hell im only doing 3 hours tomorrow. but my head is still trying to make it seem like its gonna be the worst thing ive done and its trying to hurry up and get it over with so i can come back home and do absolutely nothing. im gonna fight to make the job part of my routine so my head cant make it something i dont enjoy (i know you wont enjoy every job but like i said, i didnt even GET there yet)

139,"Although I‚Äôm too proud and ashamed to admit this, I [23F] tend to feel much better whenever I‚Äôm dating someone, which doesn‚Äôt happen that often. But when it does, I feel increased energy, as though i‚Äôm invincible and don‚Äôt take things too seriously. My anxiety/panic/stress subsides. and I never make my personal issues my partner‚Äôs problem. I light up, am jolly, humorous and full of positive energy. No matter what issue arises, there‚Äôs always this underlying sense of security, which fills me with faith and i‚Äôm no longer scared or feel empty. 

As I said, i‚Äôm too proud to accept the fact that i‚Äôm incapable of generating this energy by myself and no matter how much I try, it‚Äôs impossible to feel such spark without having someone to whom i‚Äôm attracted. 

But dating doesn‚Äôt come easy to me and it takes enormous effort to get attracted to someone enough to date. But given the above circumstance, is it wise to invest time and energy in seeking a fulfilling relationship which will give me this basic sense of strength and security that most people possess naturally?",22Jun2019,3
140,"Hey everyone!

I'm just posting here to see if anyone else has had similar thoughts before. I've done my research, and it seems like it could be OCD, and I want to think it's just that and I'm not a crazy person, but I can't help but have doubts about it. Even now, as I type this, I can't help but doubt my honesty in all this, despite me knowing I've had these thoughts.

In any case, the thoughts I've been having are of me suddenly hurting family members, friends, or complete strangers. For example, if I'm on an Uber, I sometimes look at the neck of the driver and think of strangling him or her. If I'm holding a pillow, I suddenly think of suffocation. I once had this urge and thought of stabbing a loved one when I was holding a pair of scissors, which was more terrifying than the other thoughts. One thing I did notice, however, is that several times, I think of the consequences of such actions, which also seem unpleasant. 

Another thought, sometimes I view movies and prison is somehow involved. Sometimes, for some strange reason, I have doubts about the severity of prison and think it's not bad. Crazy, right? I've heard the stories and I know prison would ruin me, so what's with those doubts?

Another thing I've noticed is that I've sometimes doubted whether or not I love a certain family member (not a partner). But why? I try to come up with reasons in my head why I would doubt such a thing, after all, this person has shown me tremendous love, so there is no reason for me to not love back, and I do believe I care for this person because I like doing things for this person, and feel tremendous guilt when I do something wrong.

Another thing I've realized is that sometimes, I imagine bad things happening, but then think about how it affects me and only me, and I know that's wrong, I just don't know why I think that, am I a narcissistic person? I mean, I have tons of emotions, and express them easily, especially that of sadness and guilt, so I don't know why I think those things.

Another even scarier thought is sometimes, I think that I want some bad things to happen to others, that I doubt that me not wanting them is a lie. But why? Those things are horrible and I don't think any of those things should really be done. I've searched reasons for this before, but nothing has come up. Am I secretly an evil person, waiting for the moment to strike, and I just don't know it? What is wrong with me?",22Jun2019,2

145,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder with obsessive-compulsive tendencies. I always try to have a sense of humor about what I‚Äôm going through. I don‚Äôt mean to make light of anybody‚Äôs struggles. I know a lot of people have it much worse than I do and have a huge burden of debilitating OCD. But being able to laugh at myself does a lot to lighten the load. It also helps to be able to relate by hearing some of the crazy things that other people do.
With that in mind, what are some of the funny or crazy obsessive-compulsive things that you do? Here‚Äôs one from me: when I tie my shoes, the laces have to be even and the knot has to be centered. I often spend several minutes tying and retying my shoes to get this right. I know it probably doesn‚Äôt matter, but I do this every time!

146,"Hi guys. I had a really bad mental breakdown early last year and even though I‚Äôve spent the last year in therapy and making the world around me a better space, I still suffer with derealization/depersonalization disorder.

149,"Trying to figure out the root cause of my social anxiety at the moment. I used to be really comfortable chatting to people and very much in the flow of bumping into people and sustaining small talk conversations. I could often make people laugh and looked forward to social interaction in general, often arranging or attending University parties.

After a couple of break ups my confidence became increasingly knocked to the point now where I feel like I don't know how to talk to people. I don't really enjoy the company of others and I never feel properly engaged or connected. I struggle to think of responses at all in conversation now, it's like I can't access or recall anything interesting to discuss at all, my mind is completely blank. I miss the easy going fun person I know I was and I'm scared this is something I've completely lost now. I feel pretty lonely and I can feel people getting bored when I talk to them so I tend to avoid interaction now. Instead I spend most evenings watching Netflix and smoking a lotta weed.

Any advice on how to get out of this and become the person I was? Obviously quitting weed is probably a given but even after abstaining for a good couple months this problem has still persisted for me.",22Jun2019,1

151,"Hello! I have depressive catatonia, it links to my PTSD. 

Here is some info(based on Doctor/therapist sessions and my own research;

&gt;Depressive catatonia is a condition in which the body tenses up and becomes temporary paralyzed, or move very slowly

&gt;it comes in episodes, can last a few hours to days to weeks, mine tend to last about 1-5 hours

&gt;The mind is still active, if not hyper active

&gt;You can be posed in certain positions, or give off the same push given, seeming more solid

&gt;It can be triggered by many things, but it's mainly the body's extreme freeze response

&gt;Yes, it's very uncomfortable and hard on the body, and sometimes very scary, especially when around people you aren't comfortable with 



These are mainly from my own personal experiences with cat episodes, what I call them, some people experience different things, I've even experienced plain muteness once before, but it's still kind of a unknown and unresearched thing, and it really is scary knowing that sometimes... And if there's anyone else out there reading this with cat id love to chat, it's nice to not feel alone!


Ask me questions please! It makes me feel a bit better üòÖ",22Jun2019,1
152,"Recently I was diagnosed with OCD and also have pretty bad health anxiety. For reference I am a 20 year old female in college. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 15 after years of intense anxiety which then led to suicidal thoughts and self-harm. As a child I had health anxiety but sort of grew out of it and have only had a few instances where it came back. 

At the beginning of May I had a pretty intense anxiety attack for the first time in a year before a final for school. Then in the middle of May there was a small tornado that passed through where I live. The alarms went off and barely any damage was done but it still freaked me out pretty bad. This led to about 2 weeks of a pretty bad fear over severe weather where I would watch the news all day, looked up radars constantly and basically would panic excessively. Then I started having bad migraines and tension headaches and convinced myself I was going to have a brain aneurysm. I got over this as well and now I‚Äôve had the same fear since then that I am developing schizophrenia or will eventually. I spend so much time looking up articles and symptoms of it on google that I‚Äôm starting to convince myself I have them. 

I had to move back home for the summer (I was originally going to live in the town I go to college with roommates). I went to my psychiatrist and therapist who both told me I didn‚Äôt have schizophrenia and I was suffering from OCD. I also recently went to another therapist who told me I didn‚Äôt have schizophrenia as well. It‚Äôs like I know that I don‚Äôt but I can‚Äôt get myself to fully believe them and just let this worry go :( I obsess over every little thing my body feels. I check that every movement or sound is actually there which I know a schizophrenic person probably wouldn‚Äôt do because they believe it is there. And I know schizophrenic people have delusions and believe things others know aren‚Äôt true and sometimes I‚Äôll think about the delusions I‚Äôve read about and then think I‚Äôm having them now (if that makes sense lol). 

I believe that my OCD was probably caused by many stressors in my life. The small tornado that passed through the city I live in, my dad has stage 4 cancer, my grandmother was recently in the hospital and things didn‚Äôt look good for awhile (she‚Äôs thankfully doing okay again!!), I was sexually assaulted my senior year of high school when I was blackout drunk. I never really processed my assault or talked about it until recently for reasons that I don‚Äôt even understand. I felt like it was my fault because I was drunk and that maybe he didn‚Äôt mean to do that to me. I talked about it with my therapists and they told me it‚Äôs not my fault and that it‚Äôs common for victims to have ‚Äòguilt‚Äô and sympathy for the people who attack them. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else has this fear and could give me tips on how to stop worrying. I am also a very rational person and try to stay positive so my OCD over this is really starting to get me down. It makes me feel out of control and makes me think negatively. I love being able to go out with friends and just living life but this is really holding me back from doing the things I love and I don‚Äôt want it to anymore. Thanks in advance to anyone who answers this :) 

Also thought I‚Äôd just put it out there that I am in no way judging anyone who has schizophrenia. I know developing schizophrenia is not the end of the world and with the right treatment many of those diagnosed lead fulfilling lives.",22Jun2019,1
