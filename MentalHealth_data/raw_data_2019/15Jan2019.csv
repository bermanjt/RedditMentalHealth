0,"I have extremely long low periods where I suffer from severe depression.  People say I seem “chill, relaxed, no nonsense, laid back, confident” when I’m depressed.  I’m not any of those things.  Im a fucking wreck.  I don’t know why anyone perceived me like this.  I don’t know why anyone reads that from me.  I feel like I radiate despair.  I’m kinda shocked the opposite is perceived.

Sometimes I have elevated moods.  I’ll have something going good for me for once and I’ll feel happy.  When I’m happy I’m so fucking hyper and exuberant.  I just want to make jokes and smile and hang out with people.  People repeatedly tell me that I’m “annoying, abrasive, too much, overwhelming, obnoxious” when I’m actually just in a good mood for once.  They hate my jokes.  They want me to stop talking and be quiet again.  They wish I would just “chill out” again.  

Chill out?  I’m not chill, I’m fucking depressed.

As you can imagine these interactions just make me depressed again...",15Jan2019,1
1,"so after struggling for over a decade i’m finally on a combination of meds (adderall and trintellix) that works for me and that i’m able to get/take fairly consistently. the problem is that i’m about to start an office job where i’ll be working 8am-5pm Monday through Friday, and i don’t know how i’ll be able to keep seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis. online visits won’t work since they can’t prescribe controlled substances like adderall, and i haven’t had any luck finding psychiatrists that accept my insurance and offer appointments outside regular business hours. has anyone else had this problem and found a way to make it work?

probably cross posting everywhere i can bc i’m pretty desperate right now.",15Jan2019,1
2,"I have periods of which I am depressed to the point of being severe and suicidal thoughts. I that I share many of the same traits with depression, and maybe a few expexruons that I just firce my self to overcome. I've had it in random intervals from a half hour to over 2 weeks.  I have beams of sunlight to fill the gaps, but it last no more than 15 to 30 minutes. Then the actual good times were filled with me tired and not my body from the episode. It feels like I am getting pulled two different ways. I thought I was bipolar since they happend too frequently and it was mixed with random anger, but I just noticed that I got frustrated because my depression kept getting bigger and more symptoms started happening like mental and physical numbness.

I would just like to know if I have depression or a mix with bipolar. I also been told I might not even have depression because of my past, so I was wondering if it is normal to experience theses thoughts very early at 5 (I started puberty around this time since my dad said he didn't have anything like me until 12) to 15 from just a bad life?


Thank you in advance. ",15Jan2019,1
3," there's only one thing that makes me cry. For some time now i've been afraid of not finding love, i feel like nobody loves me. I get filled with sadness and anger just thinking that people chose looks and not the personality, i began wondering if it's worth living a life where i feel that nobody loves me. But i was a bit more complicated i didn't want anybody i didn't want some girl with a face full of makeup, i wanted someone who would be funny, be silly, act like a human with emotions. Basically someone who would not pretend to be someone they're not. And eventually i got afraid that people like that don't exist, well at least not in this shithole i live in. That fear developed in to depression. Maybe it's an effect of my parents always wanting me to marry and have children. But i grew sadder and sadder, eventually suicidal thought entered my brain, and everyday i wanted to meet that perfect someone. I am not a man of looks, but i am also not a man looking for looks like i said i wanted someone who wouldn't hide their emotions someone kind and pure. I cried, and cried, still wondering if this life is worth living. But while crying i look in the mirror, i see what i was doing just by thinking about suicide i was kiling myself very slowly. But that day in the mirror i saw myself and finally realised what i've done i've become the exact opposite of the person i want to meet, i became sad i didn't want to go out. It was truly hell. Then i started to i guess care more about myself. And what i thought about while looking at myself is if i completly lose hope and commit suicide, and the person i am looking for truly exists that i wouldn't get to meet her. IF i killed myself i couldn't meet anyone especially  not the person i imagined. So for my entire search for love the thing that kept me going was the thought that if i killed myself i would never get to meet that special person. 

 If you feel like crying, cry then take a good long look in the mirror think about why you're crying how you can fix it and if it's something you can't change how you can forget about it or make it just a little better. Imagine it as talking to a friend who's sad what you would tell them then all of the things you think of or say, you have to do, you have to succed because staying determined and having hope is what keeps you going and when you keep going nothing can hold you back. Stay strong never think that emotions are weak. Sometimes it's the emotions of other is the thing that makes us feel emotions. Never give up hope and most importantly never give up on life.﻿ ",15Jan2019,1
4,"LONG POST WARNING 


Also I’m 13

ok where the fuck do I even start? 
I’ll just do some explanation and some point form.

•when I was little I made these imaginary friends. Now it’s like they never go away, I feel like people are here constantly. I even feel uncomfortable while using the bathroom because of it.
I know that aren’t their but I constantly feel a presence around me. I think I’m going crazy.....

•I’m stressed about everything. I haven’t done any work at school in like 3 weeks. I constantly just tell myself that I can’t do it.

• Kicked doctor at 4


•Called mom a bitch and cunt at 5

•I’m depressed, I can’t sleep, I dread the next day, I cry every second night.

•I’m obsessed with how I look, I feel like I’m ugly and horrible. I beat myself up constantly for being so skinny. I want to gain weight but I can’t and it’s fucking torturing me.

•I’m jealous of everyone I see, I’m jealous of my friends, I’m jealous of my mom.  I was never like this before

•I did horrible things as a child such as kicking doctors and calling my mom horrible names at 7 years old.

•I did fucked up things with my toys as a little kid. I would make my stuffys “fight to the death” and “mate” or even “rape each other” I was obsessed with sexual things involving animals at 7 years old as well. (IM NOT ANYMORE) but my friend was too so I thought it was normal. I am an animal lover and can’t see myself doing this. 


• I use different personalities in every situation to benefit myself. And I mean completely fucking different person between school, home, and different friends/teachers.

•I use charm and “becoming friends” with certain people who I want on my good side to benefit me in the future.

•I suffered horrible night terrors when I was younger to the point where the second I closed my eyes I was dying or seeing someone smothering my pet cat with a pillow.

•I make up strategic plans on how I would kill or harm someone. I HAVE NO INTENTIONS ON ACTUALLY DOING IT

•I take no responsibility for anything and will attempt to lie my way out of anything and everything.

•no matter what I do to someone I still make up reasons that I’m better than them.

• I used to constantly study others at school and mimic what they do to fit in.
Now I’ve basically trained my brain to know how to act when I walk in to the schoolyard

•I’m constantly looking for ways to get blackmail and revenge on people 

•I use people’s emotions and strong feelings against them when I’m angry

•I have no guilt after doing anything to anyone, Most of the time it’s their fault. Even if I started it.

•I don’t learn much of anything from my actions. I’ll do the same thing to people 10 times before I even start to learn shit.

•consequences don’t effect or deter me.  I honestly couldn’t care less if you keep me indoors for recess and don’t let me see my friends. And if I’m given detention I will just find something to do. I get upset when given the consequences but once they are happening I don’t give a shit.

•I go on violent screaming crying rages 
And have week long mental breakdowns 

•I pretend to like people to get better grades. Including teachers, I study how the good kids act towards the teachers so I can learn to do it myself.

•I try to find ways to pursuade or manipulate teachers in to giving me better grades,Even blaming them.

•I try to make myself cry and breakdown by torturing myself with sad music.

•I have no excitement for things like Christmas.  Even though I’m only 13.

•I tell myself that I’m lying about my mental issues and exaggerating it.

• I stare off in to space all the time 

•I can’t focus anymore on anything for long periods of time

• I lose all motivation for everything and just want to sleep all day.


The last thing is hard to describe. I basically turn certain emotions on when I go to school and then turn them off when i go home. At home I have this feeling of no emotions and extreme sadness and anger. Sometimes I experience what feels like no emotions at all. While at school I’m laughing and generally experience very strong emotions.


And I know I just sound like an asshole but I need help. I’m seriously begging someone to help me. My family doctor has laughed at me before so I don’t feel comfortable speaking to her. My school counsellor will tell my mom and teachers behind my back (everyone I know who has seen her in 3 different schools has experienced this) she also twists things to make us all seem suicidal or something.
My mom and family is not an option for reasons I don’t want to disclose on the internet. I have no grammar and I’m very aware.

5,"I'm 20. I've been dealing with anxiety, depression, and trauma related issues since I was 13-14. It's been a *long* time. I haven't been on medications since I was ~16, because the ones I was on were messing me up *big time*. An antidepressant I was on had such a bad reaction that I have a two-week blank spot in my memory. Apparently I did little more than sleep that whole time.

Anyway, so the current struggle right now is that my depression is kind of ruling my life. The anxiety more or less faded away and only really flares back up in places with a lot of people.

I'm *incredibly* stressed out, though. It's been so bad I.. I guess you can say attempted(?) suicide back in September. I was going to jump off an overpass but decided against it after a brief mental breakdown. I don't know if that falls more under 'attempt' or 'choosing not to follow through'.

Anyway.

I'm unemployed, which is a huge factor of my stress. I haven't been able to get a job since I got my GED, which was a bit over 2 years ago now. I had one, but I had such a massive anxiety attack on my first day that I quit by lunch time. That was back in July. It's been nothing since, not for my lack of trying.

So, I figured I'd kind of lay low and work on myself before I throw myself back out there again. Maybe fixing some other issues, or at least patching them up in a decent fashion, will boost my confidence enough to help me land a decent job, y'know? So I'm trying to work out and get myself in shape, get my driver's license, that kinda thing.

But my grandma doesn't really understand that, no matter how many times I lay it out. I've told her about my problems, and how my issues work. Many times.

I learned that she thinks I've been faking it all this whole time, as some long-con plot to be a freeloader for the rest of my life. It frustrates me, quite a bit. It's like she never listened to anything I said, like my fucking dad.

I don't know what I thought I'd get out of this. I guess I needed to just yell into a void for a minute.",15Jan2019,1

7,"(I'm not going to, don't worry)

The meds I'm on are good, they don't make me feel void of emotion of zombie-like or anything, but if I ever forget to take them for a few days I get extremely overemotional and it shows.  I'll sob at songs that make me feel nostalgic, or movie and TV scenes with any hint of emotion in them.  It's like I feel everything amplified to a million percent.

On the one hand it sucks because it makes me very oversensitive and that in turn makes me testy and I've gotten into some bad situations with friends because of it.  On the other hand...it's nice just to ***feel*** things so deeply sometimes, to be really profoundly emotionally impacted by things.  I know it's not healthy, and it feels bad at times, but it's also nice in a weird way.

10,"I don't really know how to word this… but i'll just start at the top…. When i was younger (idk when) i was diagnosed with adhd.. severe adhd.. i was prescribed a low dose adhd medicine and eventually moved up to adderall. I remember when i first started taking adderall.. and honestly i can't remember 8+ years of my life after that because the adderall had brainwashed me to a point of, i wasn't who i wanted to be, i was what the adderall made me… a fucking creature. Fast Forward to 7-8th grade i had stopped taking them bc real they were to expensive and honestly didn't do much for my adhd other than make me brain dead.i had gained a lot of weight and am still overweight because of the sudden stop of taking the pills i had put on almost 100 lbs by freshman year. being ultimately controlled by adderall most of my life and it caused me to isolate myself from friends and family so its all i knew… to be honest all i can remember. I never did well in school bc of my lack of attention, so my parents were always angry with me, so my mom specifically began almost hating me because i’m not like my brother (straight A’s kid) shed always belittle me and unfortunately still does to this day but i've been able to just accept it, my father never belittled he was honestly the only person who ever stood up for me even tho he only did it very rarely he still wss the only one. Moving to within the last 4 years… i graduated highschool in 2016… im 21 now (its 2019). I feel have begun noticing the more or less feelings of being mentally and emotionally abused … (i am by no way saying i have it hard or saying i have it harder than anyone else this is just my story) i pretty much don't trust anything i do, i have had such a mind set of “ your a fucking failure so do what you do best” beaten into my mind i feel as tho i can't escape that feeling, constantly crushing my fucking chest to the point i have developed panic attacks, i have constant mental breakdowns and have even considered suicide many times, (no i am in no way saying i am going to commit suicide but it was a thought at one point) here's where things get a little weird for me i have considered going to a psychiatrist but if i'm being honest…. Iv never told a single person about the way i feel… none i've never even spoken the words of how i feel out loud … i'm really good at hiding my feelings at times i feel to good 

Iv always been horrified at the idea of suddenly not being what everyone thought i was i always played the guy who laughs everything off and can usually take a punch of criticism. So to suddenly be broken down scares me and i don't know why. Not even my parents know how i feel. The only person i have ever come close to speaking with about my feeling was my ex girlfriend even then only mentioned a little of how i feel and even only that over text.. something in me just feels as tho it wants nothing and everything to change at once and i guess i'm making this as kind of a sort of … hello this is the real me and i'm sorry i hid this for so long but i just can't seem to hide it anymore i don't know what to do now…

12,"Short version: Overcame my fear of intimacy and asked and got a first date but later on got rejected but still proud of myself.  
  
Long version: quick background; for the first ten years of my life i grew up in a messed up abusive environment. Like when I cried the people who watched over me would stick a kitchen tongue in my mouth and threaten to cut off my tongue to get me to stop crying. Beatings and other punishments were daily. Fast forward, second decade of my life there was no physical abuse and i was just pretty much left alone as long as I did well in school, although I developed severe depression for all of high school and came really close ending it a few times. As a result I had almost no friends in high school and I was even too anxious to appear in public. Now that I'm on my own in college I've finally made some really good friends, for the first time in my life, with whom i've even managed to discuss my probs and in addition the college psychiatrist prescribed me paxil so that’s been helping.  
  
So eventually I developed feelings for this really nice shy girl, and slowly over few months time i've built up the courage to ask her out. I lost weight and I'd wake up nauseous and vomit soon after and go to bed with a migraine every other day because of the stress, so it wasn’t an easy experience. Initially I couldn't even approach her, but eventually I asked her out and we had a date that I believe went well. Unfortunately later on she told me she didn't wish to lead me on and that she'd prefer us to just be friends. I took it well because I was kinda proud that I got that far. Also i feel that I played my cards as best as I can in my situation, so yeah. We’re still friends to this day, and I guess I still have feelings for her, but i'm gonna respect her decision and not pursue her romantically. Since then I've asked a few others out and also got rejected but I am not at all upset about that. I guess right now im slightly worried about whether I'll ever find anyone who I would like as much, since because of her I managed to overcome my fear. But we'll see. Worst comes to worst, if I spend my life alone at least I'll be able to say I tried.

13,Feeling lonely. ,15Jan2019,1
14," 

Let me start off by saying that I don't think I fit the stereotypical 'forever-alone' persona (whatever that may be?). Im currently a Freshman at the University of Vermont who loves learning and generally interested in many subjects. I would consider myself an introvert, although I do hold many qualities extroverts have, its just I sometimes get burnt out easily. I pay close attention to the clothes I wear and I try to always look my best. I dont exercise on a regular basis, but I would consider myself to be healthy (6', 183 pounds) and I have been playing sports my whole life. I would consider myself an attractive guy (prob a \~7.5 in my view) so I dont think appearence is the issue. I still sometimes go play pickup basketball and meet cool people there, but I feel extremely awkard and invasive if I ask to add somebody on social media. I have the fear that I will begin to stutter (I used to stutter when I was younger, but I have for the most part gotten rid of that habit) or totally butcher what I wanted to say and embarress myself. I'm not trying to make it sound like it is impossible for me to talk to another human, its just I fear I will embarress myself and get laughed at (externally or internally) even though all I'm trying to do is build a relationship.

Even though I grew up in a very tight-knit community and had a very general group of friends, I seemed to always be alone. I have never had a best friend growing up, or really even a close friend with the exception of 1 person, but even then it wasn't much. I grew up in the middle of nowhere (my gradution class had 22 kids in total), and was raised by my 2 Roman Catholic parents, and nobody else around unless it was the holidays. During highschool I never partied, and spent most of my nights getting stoned in my room, reading, or playing video games/music.

Before I went off to college at UVM, I thought I was going to finally turn my social life around and make friends that will create lasting memories. Although I do have 2 or 3 people I will occasionally see and talk to, I still have yet to make a ""friend"" that I can talk to and hang out with. I see everyone else posting photos of them and their friends, and creating memories with each other, while I just waste away in my dorm room wondering what I did wrong. I have yet to attend a ""party"" here at UVM, because I dont know where to find them or know somebody that would know.

My entire life I've felt this sense of lonliness, and haved failed when it comes to human relationships. I can't seem to get that 'connection' with other people and I can't progress past being just an 'acquaintance'. The few women who have gotten to know me have said ""you would be an amazing catch (for somebody else)"". I want to be perfectly clear though, this isn't a rant about the friend-zone. It's more of a rant about .. not having a solid and meaningful relationship (platonic, romantic, or otherwise) with another human being. I seem to also have trust issues, where I might purposovly avoid talking to a girl because I think she is attractive, and I fear she will cheat on me after I've put my trust in her.

I know that I'm not perfect and each day I try to work to improve myself. I read a lot and I love learning about things, so I always have things to talk about, but I honestly just don't know what my problem is. I feel like there is something wrong with me. Whenever there was partners in school, I was always the one who worked alone. Everybody seemed to have a best-friend or that one person they wanted to partner with except for me. I didn't see myself as the ""outsider"" or ""weird kid"", in fact many people liked me, but I guess I always always their third or fourth or fifth choice. I try to remain optimistic and I go out of my way to change this.. but I have had NO luck so far.

I want to go out and make friends, but I just dont know where to go or what to do. And even if I did have a friend or girlfriend to hangout with, I wouldnt even know what to do! When people say, ""do you want to hang out?"", what do you do around town besides go shopping? I feel most comfortable going over to other peoples dorms/locations, because I feel like I will fail to entertain if I bring somebody to my dorm (Although I do have a stereo and speakers, what are we going to do, just sit there and listen to music? I'm getting anxious just thinking about it, I'm afraid of being a letdown in front of people and them thinking I'm ""lame"") Since I've been dealing with this lonliness and overall sense of depression since I was 13, (lonliness ever since I could remember), I haven't really had anyone to ever vent to. Because of this I used apps to talk to strangers over the internet in order to fill that void. I love both fo my parents, but I dont feel comfortable enough to discuss some of these feelings and ideas. Neither of them are good listeners, and whenever I do say something they always hear it differently, leaving me with nobody to listen to me and understand what Im trying to say. .

I try to go out as often as possible, but it seems that I just have incredibly bad luck with actually meeting people who share my values and interests, or I dont know where to go to actually meet people. I've only ever lived in rural VT and Burlington, so maybe a change of scenary will help, but I'm afraid I would see the same results.

\~ I also want to point out that I'm aware being overbearing turns people off from you, so I dont velieve the problem is me being too availible or wanting to always spend time with someone, although if somebody wanted to be around on a fairly daily basis I would be more than willing to maintain that relationship.",15Jan2019,1
15,"19F here. I have a long and negative relationship with mainly myself and really don’t like many people. 

For the past three years, I’ll meet a boy, we’ll start talking, I’ll think we’re going to date, start to trust him, and BAM he ghosts me. This has happened six times, and this includes a nine month dry spell I took to focus on school. This happened after I actually landed a boyfriend but dumped him because we just weren’t a good match and I realized I was only with him just to have a boyfriend. 

I am very aware that I am very dependent on (romantic) attention from others and have found that I’m always much much happier when I think I’ll start dating somebody soon. 

I started seeing a therapist this time last year (whom I stopped seeing after 5 months because she was a school therapist and I transferred) and I never felt comfortable enough with her to tell her anything that was really bothering me because I am terrified of being hospitalized. 

Over my winter break, once again, I had a boy that I was waiting on to see when I got back to school. He ghosted me by the second day of classes. It made me feel like shit because I was really convinced we would date and I had started telling him about my mental illness history. 

I’m usually really nice to everybody and really consider everybody’s feelings and always step on eggshells to not hurt anybody’s feelings. I know most people aren’t like this and I don’t know why but I’m just so tired of feeling like nobody cares about me/ wants me/ likes me that I’ve been snapping at almost everybody now that I’ve come back to school. 

Two of my roommates moved out. I never really liked either of them. Both of them kept coming to my dorm and I gave one 2 hours to pack up her shit and leave (she never paid her housing payments, always caused drama, has really loud friends always over, etc) after she had some random guy over to help her move out. 

The other one I have a love/ hate relationship with. We spent a lot of time together last semester but we’re polar opposites. She’s insanely extroverted, says whatever is on her mind, and does whatever she wants whenever she wants, and I have a class with her. She’s invited herself over 3 times now after class and takes a nap on the couch before work while I go to my last class of the day. This is fine. 

Today my RA was at my dorm and it felt like they were purposefully trying to knock me down a metaphorical peg. So I made up an excuse to make them leave and they wouldn’t leave, even though neither of them live with me. I elaborated on the lie further, with my heartbeat in my fucking eyes and they still wouldn’t leave. I blacked out, but I said something that implied I never wanted to see her again. 

This is true, but really out of character for me. I never stand up for myself. I’m really upset with how everything in my life is going and every time I go out in public, I feel like I’m on the verge of either bursting into tears or having a panic attack. 

Just about every doctor I’ve seen in recent years has wanted to put me on either antidepressants or anti anxiety medication and I always refuse. I don’t know why. My best friend is really encouraging me to try out medication. I don’t know why, but I don’t want to. 

I feel really out of it and other people have pointed out to me that I’ve started acting and talking differently, and saying that I’m more confident, which I think is just part of my sudden snappiness (I don’t know what else to call it). I keep meaning to go to an on campus counselor, but again I don’t want to. I don’t know why. 

This is really long winded and I don’t really know what I want from posting this. I feel like I’m going crazy and say it to just about everybody I know. 

tl;dr I’m doubting my sanity and don’t know what to do ",15Jan2019,1
16,"I was getting ready to head out and my mom suddenly asks me if I am bipolar and proceeds to explain how my mood was really ugly this morning and how my boyfriend doesn't deserve to put up with it. I tried to keep a calm composure since I felt she just called me out of the blue, and my mom is not very good at bringing up my depression without being kind of hurtful. I tried to explain that to call someone out and diagnose them, even if she is just joking around, is not cool and disrespectful. Both my dad and her were immediately defensive and tried to explain they weren't trying to joke around or be disrespectful. I tried to express that to diagnose me without talking to me first was hurtful. Simply, because instead of talking to my dad about my moods and trying to figure me out, she could have asked me, ""Hey,  I noticed you were upset this morning. Was everything okay?"" I would have let her know that I was late to work because I couldn't find my keys. Meanwhile, she suddenly springs up a conversation about making a meeting with a lawyer who would help me state my case for U.S. residency. I was quite overwhelmed and upset thinking about this as I was rushing out the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a long and complicated relationship with my mom, as she thinks it's not okay to be depressed, and with my dad who believes people with mental illnesses (even though actively working on themselves, have a good internship right out of college, exercise) can't succeed to the same degree as those without these types of obstacles. What hurts me the most is knowing that it's difficult for me to share these feelings openly because there is a chance I'll become emotional, which is not received well by them. They get annoyed and believe there is nothing to cry about, which in turn makes me more emotional. I can perceive why they think the way they do, but overall I feel so hurt and misunderstood I wouldn't want to expend energy trying to make them feel or see how I move in the world.

18,I've been having a really tough time lately (duh) and its gotten to the point where my friends are kind of creating a support network for me which is absolutely amazing and I can't thank them enough for it. I have been falling deeper and faster than ever before and my good friends have noticed this. They have actually gotten so worried that they are now writing my therapist letters to essentially tell him how bad it seems from the outside. I got angry at myself because instead of going out and telling them that they don't need to do this or that I'm ok I let them help me. Now I know that sounds kind of weird but allow me to explain that in the past when people have tried to help me it always ends up bad because to be honest I don't really want help. I want people to talk to but I don't really want a solution so I decided a long time ago instead of burdening my friends with my unproductive sadness I would just talk to a professional. I feel so bad that I'm putting on them and I hope that they are ok and I'm not causing them too much stress. Im sorry for ranting and I know that Im being a hypocrite by putting this on you guys but I hope you understand where Im coming from.,15Jan2019,1

20,"Hi, its my first post but i think i should have posted sooner.
(sorry if anythings wrong, im using mobile and im not a native English speaker)

I've been in a relationship for 3 years, I (M 19) love Her (F20)and she loves me, we are generally ok, we've had our ups and downs but we've managed to resolve everything and look for a solution and not more problems
But there is one thing we fight over a lot 
I have anxiety and she has depression, and its been manageable and calm
But i have abandonment issues ( dont know why, my family loves and cares for me and ive had a nice life) , and she is really detached ( because of family issues)of a lot of things
And thats where the problem starts
I need reassurance of love, we don't live together, we see eachother like 3 times a week , but i like to hear her voice and know about her day,and for that i use WhatsApp, i send her a lot of messages, and i would like for her to answer more frequently, she hates using her phone, and she likes to use WhatsApp to know im alive and well once a day and thats it.

I think the problem is mainly mine, i should be able to go about my day without worrying if shes alright and if she still loves me, and stuff like bad toughts, that when she doesnt answers shes passed out or dead or missing, even tho a part of me knows shes asleep or occupied. I dont know why i think or feel that way, its like once the 2 hour mark comes i get  cold feet , cold hands, increased heart rate, difficulty to breathe and the bad thoughts begin, i dont know what to do, sometimes i even get a panic atack, she wakes up and finds gibberish because i don't know how to write or something and i start to cry uncontrollably.

She is very supportive but inexperienced so she says i should get advice and/or help from professionals but also other people like us,
But that its not only me, and that she also should look for help or work on her issues too, but we both procrastinate and havent looked for advice, so i guess anything you think could help, please write it",15Jan2019,1

Constantly i have suicidal thoughts (which my parents and doctor knows about) but they think it has decreased a little bit and honestly they have but now they are back more often. The suicidal thoughts yeah suck but i wont give into them  because i cannot hurt my family like that and i am too scared to go through with it. I feel like in the future i will though. Like just say whatever and let go. Im turning 18 this year and that makes everything worse. Past that i feel so messed up i DO NOT know myself enough to explain myself.

I never try anymore in school well i have good grades in all but one class but still i cant escape my mind. I can be fine one minute and for no reason want to die or have terrible anxiety. I feel as if i am not connected with the world. Like one time i was walking with my friends in school and i was so deep in my head i forgot where i was. I always feel as if i was someone else for a second and then back to like feeling again. Now i want to admit myself to a psychiatric hospital but i just cant have my parents worry more than they do and also the cost. I also need a therapist but i feel since my parents found like nobody that covered their insurance that they gave up. They ask me randomly if i think i still need to talk to someone and each time i say yes. Because i really do.

They want me to stop crying alone. They want me to get help before it’s too late. But it feels like lies.

How could I think I was worth a moment of their time when others used me - physically and mentally? When I was nothing but a trash bag to carry emotional labor for free while curing my suffering with my head in the toilet. Out, out, out the anguish of my heart along with my dinner.

29,"I've been diagnosed with PTSD. I've been going to therapy every week for about a year now. My manager knows I have weekly ""doctor's appointments"" but he doesn't know what it's exactly for. He's been very understanding about having to leave early once a week for these appointments. For the past few months, PTSD has really been affecting my memory, and my manager has noticed my forgetfulness. I've been debating whether or not I should have a talk with him and let him know that I have PTSD and that it's been affecting my memory, especially at work. There's days I come in and can't even remember anyone's name if my life depended on it. I forget to labor transfer on the time clock when I move between departments. I forget simple things like circling numbers on the paperwork I have to do when I'm checking in incoming shipments. Circling the numbers is where he's been noticing my forgetfulness the most. I don't want him to think I don't care about my job or something, but I also don't want him to think I'm just using ptsd as an excuse. I'm not sure what I should do. Has anyone told your employer you have ptsd, and if so, what was the result of it? Were they understanding? Did you feel like you had a target on your back afterwards? I know that a lot of people don't know much about ptsd and will assume we are a danger to others, when in reality we are actually a danger to ourselves.

33,"Hi everyone, in May I had an awful panic attack on weed and ever since then I’ve been experiencing extreme anxiety and OCD symptoms. I’ve always had pretty bad anxiety but it was always something I could manage, never got to the point where I had obsessions and that sort of stuff. Welp, unfortunately since that day I’ve been dealing with constant obsessions and I think intrusive thoughts that basically ruin my entire day and kill my mood and bring me extreme anxiety to the point that it almost brings me to tears when I think about them. 
  
   My main obsession is the fear of going into psychosis and experiencing schizophrenia, along with others that I don’t even like talking about cause they’re so out of character for me and they make me extremely anxious. I’ve never had this mindset in my life but ever since that day it feels like my brain hasn’t been able to relax or even think clearly, I think of something and instead of letting it go like I used to be able to and not think about it I transfix over them which make me develop it into an obsession. 

  Has anyone experienced this? And if so, what has helped you get over it. Like I said I’ve always had anxiety but not to this level and it feels extremely foreign to me which makes it hard to find ways to cope with it. I feel like I lost my soul that day and now I’m left with and anxious neurotic mess. I’ve also been experiencing dp/dr since that day but it’s gotten a lot better. Unfortunately I can’t see a psychiatrist right now, if not I would’ve a long time ago. I just want to feel like my normal self again. Any help is greatly appreciated! ",15Jan2019,1

36,"So it has been week 9 of my bipolar friend's depressive phase. She was seen smiling to herself but still giving off the disturbing vibe to people. Week 8 had a bit of crying, though. I am quoting the weeks here because I read that the estimated length of a phase is 13 weeks. By week 9, her irritability had mellowed out and she has been seeking alternative treatments. For one, her TCM cocktail routine (which are for the slew of things/problems she faces, like phantom pains in heel, in chest, like congestion, etc. many of which are psychological). And for another, being overly reliant on YouTuber new age advice about her life. I cannot be certain, but she has been taking more water and going to the loo more often, which I briefly took as a hopeful sign that she has been on some form of mood stabilizers, maybe lithium. If anything, I think someone in her family should mix stabilizers into her TCM concoction, knowing how stubborn she is to even admit her condition or seek legit help, other than YouTuber advice which are continuing to feed her delusions.

She harbors several strange metaphysical theories which she shares with me, that was when we were closer. Today I saw her behaving strangely (this to do with sun energy and vibes) and bam! I instantly knew her thoughts and have an explanation. She noticed my presence and attempted to behave normally but I just feel like telling her to forget the act and just be herself. I know what she's thinking, she can't hide much more from me.

I like to think that I lost a friendship and I should feel sorry towards myself but I don't. I see the way her bipolar condition is deeply affecting every part of her life, coupled with her stubbornness, her avoidance of social interactions toward anyone, her pained acting to put up a front that everything is ok. But to us people who care for her, we know better. I see how much sorry of a state she is in and I can no longer just think of myself. Her dreams and aspirations crushed two-fold because for one, her condition is deeply affecting her life, and for another, her work is too much to clear and she can hardly even go for 3-hour night classes to improve herself. There is no way she can even achieve her dreams (which she shared with me) at this rate. It is crippling her. Her face today was more blank than usual. Creepy and disturbing too. I really wish it does not be this way and there can be some form of improvement. But the thing is to wait for the phase to end, right? 4 more weeks. Time does not heal, it just evolves the progression.

There is a very suffocating and taboo culture here toward seeking help from mental health practitioners. My friend is stubborn anyway. I previously shared another reddit post on what to do. Limit interactions? Show some care, drop kind actions now and then? She just mistrusts everyone who cares for her.",15Jan2019,1

47,"So yeah, Before anything else i am a Male 15 years old, This has started happening since i was 13 and i dont think this is one of those hormone changes stuff, This is too severe to be one. Im just gonna say what im experiencing, So please give me advice or anything at all if you can. Also it's gonna be long so....Yeah.

First is my actions and thoughts are different, I feel like im not the one inside this ""Body"", Like im just inside but im not the one in control, Kinda like im just watching. I also have multiple voices in my head, There's 3 of them. One is me, But im confused because it feels like sometimes there's 2 of me, So i guess sometimes there can be 4. Also two of those voices are imaginary, But i cant erase them anymore, It's like they're stuck there. I cant focus because they always talk and talk it's so frustrating. I was also hiding my emotions before all this started already, Because of my parents. So maybe that's something. I already had depression at 10 years old, It got more severe throughout the years until now. My parents never tried helping me because they always say they dont have money or im just sad. I was a kid so i couldn't do anything, Until now not even once i've never gotten any psychiatrist or whatever. And to be honest it's really tiring, I still want to live but it's so hard when it's like this. I cant kill myself, Part of me wants to live but the ""me"" inside wants to die and always cries everytime, I feel sad for him, Or me rather. I dont know there's like two of me, It's so hard to explain, It kinda ruins my life. A lot of people also hated me because they said i was ""Weird"". I ended up having no friends, But i dont feel lonely because i have these dudes with me. They might be imaginary but they're my friends. You know i've been working out and also getting motivated at basketball, I just want to live normal. But people still say im weird, I dont get what's weird with me. I cant go to school, I've dropped out because of all this too. 

Also im gonna talk about my parents, I think it all started because of my parents, They used to actually slap me with a metal rod when i misbehave and they say ""Parents know best."". They even tied me up once like for a day without food and water, It was scary considering i was 11 at that time. They even push my head on a wall sometimes until i bleed if i dont do what they say. They were very strict and i need to follow everything they say, Everything i do wasn't like me, I feel like i was being controlled. So i just hid everything, My emotions, My happiness, I just said to myself when i was 10 that ""If hiding my emotions will make my parents happy then that's good enough for me."" But the thing they couldn't control is this, Internet. The internet is where i can let go of everything and just have fun, But that's what i thought, But now im 15 i disappointed my parents, I cant give up but the ""me"" inside is tired, The other 3 keeps motivating him but he cant anymore. I want to die. I just want to make the people around me happy but no matter what i do i cant. My parents are kind, I know they are. Im just not being good enough, I want to be able to go up and be proud of myself, Like those Hall of famers in the NBA, I gave up my dreams for my family. It's like a house collapsing all at once, All that hard work. I want to live a normal life. Maybe i should just go to those Mental asylum if im so weird, Why do people hate me for trying to live normally anyway?

And yeah probably i dont want help, I dont even know what i want, Maybe i just post things so i could wind out a little bit, I dont know. I want help, Maybe that's what i need. Please please dont advice me to go to a doctor or something, Please advice something else. People always say that same thing, I want some actual advice not instructions on what to do, Please.

Alas nobody came in, as I picked up the razer it slipped out of my hands and slid across the floor the the other side the bathroom. I decided maybe it was a sign and got out. As I left the bathroom I found my 5 year old sister sitting against the wall outside the bathroom. She had being waiting out there the whole time for me to play basketball in the backyard with her.

Prozac still gives me diarrhea. Taking Pepto has helped, but the nausea isn’t going away. I am losing my appetite. Therapy helps a little, but I’m wishing for immediate relief out of hell.

I do not want to teach anymore. This is my third year, but I’m at a point where I can’t keep going. The kids aren’t even that bad this school year. I was told I’m doing so well. But I am miserable, and I’m sinking. I told myself to keep going, and now I’m breaking.

I am seeing a counselor through my union to walk through my feelings and the option to take a sick leave. I was suggested Xanax and will pick up that prescription in the morning.

I know it’s bad that I’m taking so many sick days. I know it’s bad for the kids. A teacher I confided in told me I can’t keep giving if I’m empty, and to return when I’m 100%. I don’t think sick leaves can happen on the spot, so I probably have to go back for a bit and hope Xanax will help me through a bit. I want the kids to at least know I’m not well, but it’s not because of them. I just can’t cope with this job anymore. I need an emotional break. My love for the kids isn’t enough anymore.

I’m really broken. My boyfriend kept pushing me and encouraging me, but I had to be honest with him that I can’t anymore. I need the sick leave- and he told me it hurts to see what’s happening with me. I don’t like having my boyfriend or my mom to see me like this and falling apart. I don’t like worrying my kids, the parents who did reach out to me, and my fellow teachers.

But for whatever reason, I don’t have it in me anymore. This job gives me too much anxiety, and I need to know there’s a way out. I don’t know if I can teach anymore. I really just prefer an office job and do writing on the side. 

Please tell me it will get better. ",15Jan2019,1
53,"My brother has lost it completely. He thinks that every twitch streamer and their chat that he's watching can see him. Whenever the streamer reacts to anything or when the chat reacts he believes it's directed at him. He talks to his computer monitor at night for hours saying he'll sue them if they keep watching him. I've explained to him how that's impossible but he can't understand anymore. He's unable to realize how absurd he sounds. He believes chat and the streamer can see him through his phone when it's on. Whenever his phone is off he's completely fine with twitch.

 I've asked him to go through a test which he agreed on in which I take his phone while he's watching any twitch stream and keep it off. I then would turn it on without him knowing when and he said he'd be able to tell when his phone is on and when twitch and chat is ""watching him"" without seeing his phone. He failed to discern when the phone was on 5 times in a row and left still believing he's right. He thinks im crazy, and that the whole family is crazy for not seeing how they are ""obviously"" watching him. He refuses to go to a therapist. What can I do? Is it impossible to help him?",15Jan2019,1
54,"I had a bad breakdown tied to work back in 2013. I'd been working full time since graduating high school in 2005, climbing the ladder at a religious conference center/missionary training center. The reasons behind the burn out were complex and I'm not going to go into them. I ended up going to college, getting married, and becoming a dad. I also worked. I was mostly doing fine. Then the primaries hit and my social circles started to fall apart as things got divided. A bunch of my beliefs had changed and things progressively got toxic with people I knew. Over the last two years I feel worse then when I got burned out at work. I've fail two semesters of college, dropped out. Struggled to maintain work, and almost committed suicide three times. Everyday I try to disconnect myself from politics but I cant seem to get away. Comments made by people around me, news, making the mistake of going on FB. I just want to get healthy again. Figure out how to be a healthy Dad. Figure out a degree to pursue again. Figure out how to love myself and not see myself as a failure. Be able to rebuild a friend group, 'cause let me tell you it sucks coming from a country background and trying to find new friends when you've more or less been disowned by your old ones. I just cant get over this feeling of loss and losing faith in everything I trusted. I want to start over but feel stuck.",15Jan2019,1

57,"I'm frustrated. 

the more and more signs i have pop up, the more it reminds me that I can't get the help i need. My parents refuse to take me to a therapist, even if I've been pleading for a while now. They're just used to being around ill people and leave help to the last minute, and that really sucks. 

When i started logging my blackouts, and had a really freaky experience with what i think is some sort of other personality talking to me via computer, my first thought was that i was malingering. But that doesn't make sense, i sure as hell don't want my people in my personal life to know this. 

Whether this is DID or not, i really don't know. DID is trauma based, i don't think i have any traumas? And if something did happen to me, i don't have any proof, nor would i want to falsely accuse someone, i really despise those who purposely pin horrible things onto people.

When i was a kid, i used to wear multiple pairs of bras and panties, in fact, i started wearing bras when i was 8 years old. the most i think i'd have on would be about 6 or maybe seven, it was like my own chastity belt. My mother never really knew why i did that, i don't even know why.  

I don't know, I've been thinking about that alot lately.

I can't see a thearapist, and i'd rather not have people on Reddit diagnose me, so i'll just have to do alot of the dirty work by myself. I have been talking to online counsellors, but they don't really help much with stuff like this, I'm considering telling my boyfriend, he know's a little about whats been going on, but nothing about me talking to ""myself"", i don't know if it'll be too much on him. 

This might be the last time i talk about this ordeal, unless something important comes along, thanks for reading.

I'm not using my primary account because I don't want this conversation to follow me into the future (meaning I'm not suicidal). However it would be cool if this random post eventually helped someone, and I suppose I should mention that that suicide hotline number in the United States is 1-800-273-8255. 

  

As a sidebar, the closest thing I can compare suicide to is wanting to lose your virginity (albeit on the complete other end of the emotional spectrum); you don't care how it happens, you just have this burning desire for it to happen now. HOWEVER, I implore suicidal individuals to join me on a thought experiment. Pretend like you pulled the trigger (or whatever), tomorrow doesn't matter, right? Well then don't pull the trigger. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy tomorrow. Your alternative plans were to be dead, so who gives a shit if you skipped work today to spend the day in the park... The whole ""selfish"" thing doesn't affect me. Thats not why I'm still alive. But I need help.

61,"My psychiatrist diagnosed me as ADHD (which I self-dx'd and sought help for), Bipolar III (cyclothemia?) and ""a little OCD"" and ""some symptoms of Generalised Anxiety"". I'm sure the quote marks give it away but I disagree with the OCD and Generalised Anxiety parts of the diagnosis. 

My psychiatrist seems to not understand ADHD and it's symptoms and I think this is why he has labelled me as OCD and anxious rather than realising it falls under my ADHD diagnosis. I have had to explain the reason I self-medicated with coffee and energy drinks before being diagnosed and he blatantly ignores the symptoms of my ADHD when he does a check-in, only asking about my ""anxiety"" and whether I'm feeling depressed or manic. I have to offer the information that I'm being able to organise things better now that I'm on meds, or focus better, or control my emotions better. He doesn't ask about any of these in order to gauge whether my medication is working properly. He also seems to be against me being on stimulants, saying that I had to try Staterra before being prescribed the Dexedrine I had successfully been on before. 

What he has interpreted as anxiety or OCD compulsions is what I'm describing as hyperfixation, aka my ADHD brain attaches to something like a dog with an old bone and I can't redirect my thoughts from it. This can be about a positive thing, like knowledge I need for work or school, a new video game or a new hobby; it can also manifest in a negative way by making it extremely hard to put aside what start out as a reasonable concerns or indecision. Medicating my ADHD has given me more control over these and I find it much easier to redirect now. 

In the past, this inability to redirect did lead to a few panic attacks. Possibly about 10 in as many years, though at least three were caused by a negative reaction to the preservatives in alcohol. I have self-harmed in the past, though even before I went onto mood stabilisers I was working on reducing it through DBT. Now that I'm stabilised, it's been years since I have. 

I have consulted the DSM-V criteria for both Generalised Anxiety and OCD and I've also spoken to my friends who suffer from these conditions and my experience is nothing like their own. I also don't meet the DSM criteria, which my psychiatrist never consulted while diagnosing me. I feel it's not possible to be ""a little OCD"", just like it's not possible to be ""a little ADHD"" or ""a little autistic"". You either are or you aren't. I fully intend on bringing my disagreement with his diagnosis to his attention now that I've been able to actually read the criteria. For reference, any anxiety symptoms I have shown have been situational; I do not have a general feeling of dread, I do not fear that something's bad going to happen in general or to a person if I don't fulfil some unrelated criteria etc.

**TL;DR My psychiatrist diagnosed me as ""a little OCD"" and ""showing symptoms of Generalised Anxiety"" without consulting the DSM criteria because he is misinterpreting my ADHD hyperfixation as compulsions. ELI5 the difference between hyperfixation/special interests and OCD compulsions/Generalised Anxiety so I can best word my disagreement?**",15Jan2019,1
62,"Hi. Nutcase here. Been having a major depressive episode these last few days, pushing me to make an account and vent about it. I'm not a writer, and poor at organizing my thoughts, so this is going to be all over the place. I'm sorry. 

I'm 27, and I've been dealing with this shit for most of my life. Unfortunately, I haven't done a damn thing about it, and it just gets worse. Every single day goes by and it feels more hopeless, like I'm destined to a life of misery. I want out. I so badly want to be better - to feel like a normal person - but I have immense difficulty helping myself. I am not a fan of myself, so I don't like doing things for myself. I just grit my teeth and let things fester, and lately it feels like I'm running out of strength, or running on fumes. I can't ignore it anymore. I think about death a lot, but I don't have suicidal thoughts. I want to live, but like, actually live. This isn't living. 

I don't know what to do, or where to even start. I want a life - friends, a girlfriend, a career - things most capable people should have by now. Instead, I'm here - an art degree and my parent's house, 50k student debt, working very part-time at a pharmacy for dirt money, and working on a second Bachelor's online for IT. My parents aren't even hugely successful. They struggle financially and I can't help them. I'm a drain on them. I don't even have a driver's license due to an intense fear of being behind the wheel. My life has been a series of bad decisions, heavily influenced by my depression, anxiety, and lack of care. Art degree in video game design at a private school? Solid decision. Employers are gonna love that one. I'll worry about the loans later. 

I've tried medication. Currently on one. I'm tired of playing musical pills. None have helped. I've also tried counseling to no avail. Never been able to find one that I could connect with. I always stop going because their questions are generic and do nothing to help me. I know my problems - I just don't know what to do about them. 

I'm socially isolated and experience soul-crushing loneliness daily. We live in the middle of nowhere. I need to escape but I can't. The only socialization I get is talking to my friends online via Discord (it's like Skype) and online video games. I find second-hand socialization watching streamers on Twitch playing games. I live vicariously through them. Some are funny. Laughing helps me forget about everything. 

I'm reclusive, socially awkward, and anxious. I don't want to be. I've had love interests that I've completely ignored, unwilling to process it mentally, ignoring advances. I go days at a time not speaking to my friends, making up excuses as to why I can't hop into a game with them. Too tired, not feeling well, busy, etc. My heart pounds in situations where I need to speak to strangers. I almost failed Public Speaking. The only reason I get by working at a pharmacy is some sort of miraculous numbing that my brain does to itself, allowing me to power through the day, almost robotically. I hate it immensely, but I'm damn good at customer service. 

I'm emotionally stunted and easily damaged. I'm jealous of everything. Too attached to everything. The success of others is absolute torture for me. Happy relationships rip at my heart strings. Why can't I have these things? How am I supposed to form relationships when my emotions are still that of an overly-emotional middle-schooler? I don't want to put that kind of baggage on people. I also have this fragile pride that prevents me from doing things that I consider myself better than. I'd rather be jobless than apply for another position in retail or minimum wage. I'd feel pathetic seeking career help via unemployment agencies or utilizing government assistance like food stamps or welfare. I don't know why. 

Confident, outgoing people scare the shit out of me. Their ability to take what they want makes me upset and angry. It's not their fault - it's mine. I feel inferior, and wish I could do the same. I feel pathetic compared to them. I feel small next to them. Comparison is the thief of joy - I know - But that doesn't make me feel any better. They feel like a threat - like any success or happiness I could ever find might be stripped away or stolen by them. Ridiculous thought steeped in jealousy, but it's there and it festers and eats at me. 

I wear a very heavy mask made of apathy and nihilism, if that makes any sense. I'm so used to this that I don't even know what my real personality is. How do I help myself if I don't even know myself? This is how I act with my friends - emotionless, uncaring, etc. I want them to have fun, and I want to have fun with them, but I feel like I can't. I don't want to drag them down. 

I'm constantly on edge. Even now, I'm frantically clicking my mouse while thinking of what to write. I shake my leg, tap things, bite my lip, grind my teeth, pick my nails, etc. It never stops and I can't relax. Everything is so loud. 

I feel like this one is important, so embarrassingly I need to mention it. I'm hypersexual and absolutely addicted to adult content. I surround myself with it. I don't know why. Filling a void? Yet another form of escapism? I don't know, but it has a pretty firm grasp on me, and has for most of my adult life.

I'm out of shape and unhealthy. I'm not wildly overweight or anything, but I've been sedentary for my entire adult life and eat like shit. I can feel it catching up to me. It scares me. 

I'm a perfectionist. Nothing I do will ever be good enough. I'll probably reread this post fifty times before finally submitting it, terrified that there might be a mistake - terrified that something might be unclear. 

I feel like a child - like I stopped growing after high school. It terrifies me that I could be 30 years old and be in the same place. Thirty. That's only 3 years away and I haven't even started to become an adult yet. I understand that life isn't a race, but that's just unacceptable. I'm beyond the definition of late bloomer. 

I feel like there are multiple versions of me. A very \*very\* rare ""normal"" version of me, where I can manage to schedule an appointment that I should've scheduled for myself months prior. A me that can get my coursework done in a reasonable manner. Then there's this escapist me, ignoring all of life's demands and drowning them out with video games, YouTube, talking to friends - anything that takes my mind off of life. Finally there's this reclusive version of me that drowns out not only life's demands, but even family and my own friends. I'm scared of this one, and currently dealing with it. I won't eat. I'll sleep all day and night. I'll spontaneously cry. I can't even stomach playing video games or listening to music. It makes me physically weak. My arms shake and my legs tremble. 

Depression killed my aspirations. I used to love drawing, and was great at it. I have a natural talent for it. I wanted to be a digital artist and do digital 3D modeling. I had goals but no drive to succeed in them, no motivation to practice and build a portfolio. Instead I played games, ignored my surroundings, watched time pass by. I don't even know what I'm going to do once I finish this second degree. I have no plan, no dreams, no goals, nothing. 

How did this even happen? Military family? Lack of discipline? Is it my fault? We moved a lot - been to many schools. Had to make new friends repeatedly, making less each time, depression gripping a little more each time. Parents never gave me chores, never grounded or punished me, never taught me discipline. Coupled with my lifelong, growing depression, maybe that's why? I wish I knew. 

There's so much more that I could mention. I could make this post ten times longer if I wanted to, but I'll cut it here. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't expect a solution or some sort of miracle fix. I know life is going to be difficult for me. I guess I'm just venting, but if you read through everything, thanks for listening. I really do appreciate it. ",15Jan2019,1

65,"TL;DR: Basically I’m just asking about what’s normal about hallucinations and what’s not.

So I’d like to ask some questions about hallucinations. I guess you could say that I’ve been in kinda denial because see things that aren’t there is one of the last things that I ever thought that’d I’d experience. Basically occasionally (Maybe a few times a month but not too often. I can’t really tell you how often or when this happens. I’m yet to identify a cause) I’ll see something. Most of the time it’s like a spider or other creature except it’s very vague. I never quite see it but it’ll say run across a wall or the floor or just be in the corner of my room or on a wall. I’m fully aware that this doesn’t exist and I never clearly see it. Is this normal to experience this? Could this just be me overthinking stuff?

That type of stuff I can live with but what confuses and concerns me is other stuff that’s happened very rarely. In terms of visual stuff, sometimes I’ll think I’ll see the outline of a figure. This I’d presume is just again overthinking. As far as I know it’s mostly normal but I still feel like I should mention it. Another time I sort of saw a claw or a hand morph through a wall. This was very, very strange. It was weird. Kinda like you know in a dream how you see stuff but it’s kinda vague so in your dream you sort of tell yourself what you’re seeing. It was like that except I was fully awake and t was the middle of the day. That’s really all I can think in terms of visual stuff.

In terms of audio, asides from normal stuff like occasionally hearing your name. Sometimes I’ll hear random words. This is very very rare though so it may be normal. Other times I’ll hear stuff that just sounds off. Like a door closing or a tap dripping. I can hear it, bit for long but I’d assume that it’s really but it just doesn’t sound quite right. I’m not sure if that makes any sense. The last thing but most obvious sign that I’ve encountered (Which I should note has only happened once) was very clearly hearing a voice saying I’ll die if I stay home alone. It was weird to say the least and scared me quite a bit but that was a while ago.

What I want to know is how much of this is actually normal and what not? I understand that our brains are very complex so experiencing hallucinations does happen to everyone but I honestly don’t know what’s normal and what’s not normal. I’m not sure if age is a factor but I’m in my late teens and I have never taken drugs in my life. I apologise for the long post but thank you for reading.",15Jan2019,1

70," Hi all,  


I'm looking for advice as to how to manage my life with my girlfriend of 18 months. We moved in together after 16 months of seeing each other and I am struggling a lot.  


Though I had an abusive and violent childhood, and have suffered bouts of depression in the past, at 32 I've largely (through therapy, reading a lot, and being good to myself) moved past it. I'd consider myself a happy and positive person these days. I say this because I'd like to think I can empathise with feelings of depression, but this is beyond what I have experience in my life.   


My girlfriend seemed to have a fairly relaxed and positive upbringing, with no negative influences from what she tells me. She has increasingly been making me feel anxious, miserable and stressed. She is never happy - she's either neutral or miserable. She will have ourbursts of negative emotion, tears, sulking and misery that last days and usually have no reason.   


When she gets into these moods there is no talking to her, she becomes self pitying, and says she can't control her feelings. In addition, there is a huge emphasis on 'her feelings' and how important they are. She can cry for hours and often I'm not sure why. This happens 3 times a week or so, or, more accurately, 50% of the time. She will very often then go completely back to normal and wonder why I am still angry, distant and hurt. I am expected to very quickly return to a happy state, otherwise she will say she feels too guilty, is sick of hurting me, and the process begins anew.  


The pressure on me is immense. If I'm not in a very happy mood and willing to spend all of my free time with her, her mood will quickly slip and I'll feel like I'm living with a grumpy child. Some days I will feel sick with anxiety from all the emotion and misery, and upon reflection realise there's absolutely no reason for it. Our life is comfortable, we have good jobs and so on.  


I've offered to pay for her therapy which starts Thursday, though she was very, very reluctant to go. In addition, I believe throughout her childhood she spent most of her time discussing feelings with her friends, all of whom also seem to be depressed.  


There have been quite a few worrying situations too. For example doing grocery shopping will result in a meltdown because she can't pick between things, getting a parking ticket can result in 6 hours of absolute emotional chaos (including driving like a maniac due to resultant anger).  


Other scenarios include a full blown 24 hour meltdown following me having dinner with her and a female friend, because she hates seeing me get on so easily with another woman. This also happened when I once met one of her (male friends) and we got on. Both times resulted in situations so exhausting I am beginning to not want to see other people with her.  


I've previously had a narcissistic partner and so have become quite good at boundaries and keeping my own self worth separate to this situation, but living in such close proximity is taking a toll. I'm doing everything I can to help, however it's starting to impact my work.  


Could anybody advise me on how to manage this situation? Is breaking up the only choice? Is it likely therapy could help with such significant symptoms?  


Thanks for your help ",15Jan2019,1

74,"I have a friend that has had the worst two years on earth. She broke her lease when one of her roommates unexpectedly moved out and had to move back in with her abusive mother and sister. She has since been diagnosed with epilepsy on top of already having bpd and bpi. She was raped early last year and the police did nothing about it. She has also been stalked by her abusive ex for the past two years. He keeps finding her and leaving threatening letters and contacting her family. Her epilepsy is not under control even though she’s on meds for it and her family thinks she’s exaggerating to get attention. They don’t supervise her and she’ll fall and wake up with cuts and bloody noses or fall down the stairs and her mom doesn’t really care. Yesterday she was hit by a car while walking down the street. The car drove off and she now has kidney failure. No broken bones or anything and she is back home with her mom. This morning she confirmed she was raped again by a different guy. She was also just broken up with and is telling me that she doesn’t want to live anymore and she has posted goodbyes on all her socials. 

I called the police to do a wellness check on her. She lives 40 minutes from me or I would have gone myself. Her mother does not care or check on her and I’m afraid she might hurt herself of do something worse. 

I want to help her. I myself have been diagnosed with bpii, bpd, and gad and have been hospitalized after a suicide attempt. I know what it feels to not want to be here but I have not been through everything she has. What do I do? I won’t stand by and watch her deteriorate.

Only after I typed them out did I realize I might be suffering from something that is actively causing hurdles in my personal and academic life. So, I decided to search for an online forum before I consulted a doc. 

Here are the points I came up with:
1) Excessive daydreaming: 
 - 4-5 hours per day. 
 - Compulsion (sometimes in-between work).
2) Procrastination:
 - Simple tasks feel like a burden.
 - Hard to commit to a routine.
3) Anxiety: 
 - Suffered Androgenic alopecia since the age of 18. Anxiety over hair-loss. Wasted hours for months analysing my hair during treatment (Good hair maintenance with a strict regimen of medicines now).
 - Anxiety over hair loss in the future. Sometimes can’t control the thought loops once they start.
 - Always worried about something.
4) Forgetfulness.
 - Tasks to do, discussions, and new information are forgotten quickly. 
 - Remember much less information than my peers.
5) Feeling less intelligent than before.
 - Less to offer in a discussion.
 - Sometimes failing to make simple associations.
6) Hard to maintain diverse interests. 
 - New and interesting tasks keep me focussed.
 - Lose interest fairly quickly.
7) Impulsive:
 - Jumping from one task to another before completion. 
 - Impulsive buying and going over budget.
8) Sleep:
 - Don’t feel completely refreshed in the morning. 
 - Sleep durations ranging from 6 – 12 hours, yet not fully refreshed.

I’d be happy to know your inputs. Thanks.

76,"I've always been very anxious in social situations but overall pretty happy when I'm around other people as long as I'm not getting too much attention.

Now I'm lying more in general.
I used to be able to listen to others bit now I just sort of tune out and care very little about what they're feeling or thinking about.
I just can't seem to be able put myself in other people's shoes anymore.
I feel like like I'm getting dumber and as hypocritical(?) as it might seem I feel guilty as hell about my recent lapse in empathy.
Im so fucking disgusted by my own behaviour.

Then I stop and wonder whether what I'm thinking is real or not or if I'm trying to convince myself I'm an asshole in order to justify pushing people away because I deserve being lonely.

77,"If bad thoughts and good thoughts come from the same place, why even hold on to anything at all? 
   
I’ve dealt with a lot of issues throughout my life and have tried tons of ways to combat/cope with it. I’ve been to therapy and done work on my own and whatnot. I’ve gone out of my comfort zone as much as possible, taken in new information (but not too much because I want to avoid being a self-help junkie), and so on. I’ve turned my life around in a lot of ways. However, last year I started to develop an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and weed (funnily enough, my relationship with hard drugs is fine because I respect their effects and danger a lot more). It almost costed me my job and future career, which I realized I truly had lost control. I started to notice that my brain was trying to trick me in any way it could into getting drunk or high all the time. That it wasn't actually me who wanted it. I have controlled this by setting limits on myself and sticking to it.  
  
 I’ve been in a decent place, but I wanted to combat one more thing. My real addiction. I’ve been addicted for masturbation and porn for years so I decided that maybe tackling that is something I need to do, which I found out I am successful at stopping despite it being incredibly challenging. I think as a result of that and other experiences within the past few months, it’s built a skill/mindset where I’ve started to notice when I’m feeling something and I’m able to detach from it instead of being consumed by it. I’m not yet at a point where I feel 100% in control but I’m getting better at it. I’m noticing all sorts of thoughts and patterns and whatnot that lead to my mind going into a state of panic or depression or regret or whatever it may be. Not only have I realized just how frequently I put myself in a horrible place, but also I’ve realized that they aren’t really based on anything other than preexisting patterns and the way my brain is wired, therefore I don’t have to engage in them. This sounds good on paper, but I’m a little confused by something. I’ve also realized that my brain *really* enjoys indulging in feelings or states of mind in general, even positive ones. I’m wondering, why even keep any thoughts at all? The basis for all negative thoughts is the same as the one for positive thoughts. They are thoughts. It’s all basically connect-the-dots but neurologically; this thing triggers this thought which triggers this feeling which triggers this reaction. Even the “thinking part” of me that decides whether thoughts are beneficial to indulge in or not is equally as arbitrary as the thoughts they are judging. As is the part of me that’s trying to calibrate new ways to use/practice this skill. It’s just another thought. Me “giving in” to my positive thoughts is still training my brain to “give in” to all my thoughts. Why even have a personality? An opinion on anything? I’ve noticed certain ‘positive’ aspects of my personality and energy are based in what one would call negative (like, seeking approval, insecurity, etc). But there has been positives to that. I’ve gotten a lot of confidence and fulfillment with the mind I have, and I’ve made and sustained several rewarding friendships, but also still deal with certain states of mind.  
  
So as it sounds, I’m all confused by this and I feel like I might be turning into (more of) a weirdo. I’ve pushed this thought aside but it’s something that keeps coming up and I feel it may need attention. My fear is that I lose my personality which has helped me out a lot. The only answer I’ve come up with is that now is a training period and I’ll eventually and hopefully be able to retain just enough to not go overboard but enough to feel content. Basically, the line between negative emotion that only serves to hurt, negative emotion that has a positive to it, and positive emotion are all blending together as they all come from the same basic need which is to indulge in feelings. In short, I don't know who I am anymore and it's scaring me.",15Jan2019,1

The point is that after an history of self harm, not dealing with trauma, abandoning therapy after that appointment a few years ago and suicidal threats (including a few days ago) she seeks help by talking to me, she feels horrible because she got drunk and did tell her boyfriend she will kill herself and not tell anyone, and in general, she doesn't react well to regection and now she is super obsessed with the keto diet, to a point she doesn't eat if there's no food like that counts as keto (has eating issues not treated too, like she told me and her current boyfriend), and now she feels rage and gets really really mad about the pharmaceutical industry and doesn't trust doctors. I suggested psychotherapy because it works for me and as a future health profesional is something i believe in.
Today, after crying and telling me how hopeless she was, how crazy and undeserving of love she felt, she tells me that she sees no point of getting treatment and I'm kind of tired of trying, because I can't be her therapist, and she has many many issues and she gets mad at me very easily and I'm very worried for her, but she is an adult and she is free to decide, but after she threatened her boyfriend of killing herself and ""jokingly"" told me when we were dating, if I would care if she died, a little often.

91,"I'm not sure if this belongs here but here it is 

context (I'm 14 now, male) 2 years ago I met this girl I'll call her mia, so mia and I would play TF2 (Titanfall) all day and she had so many friends and two of them have gone on to be my best friends. so we would play all day and all night me her and like 3 other guys one will come up later (his name will be Trevor). So I started to know something was up when some random joins and pours his fucking heart out to this girl and asks her out and she fucking throws him out. Anyways fast forward to July and her best male friend who I fucking hated at the time (Tristan, My best friend now) tells me to watch out and that mia is manipulating people and talking bullshit about people but anyways a few days later I get on overwatch and ask her what the go with Tristan is and she says god knows what bullshit but the next day I get on she was ignoring me or some shit so her cousin tells me it was that I called her a bitch and she hates me. So I did whatever but the next day all the Titanfall friends I made are talking shit. So I don't remember the in between but I when on to my mates account (acting like him) and asked her some questions she said that she never even liked me and that we were never even friends and I don't know why but that cut me fucking deep also what Tristan was referring to was she told everyone that he was desperate for her (he is 2 years older than us) and that he was a pedo and asked her out via Facebook (lies). She also sent me a random insta pic of some anime bitch Then a few months later I invited her to a party to try and clear the air and I used an unnecessary insult after I found out her father was unemployed and played a lot of her ps4 and had read our chat (with nothing inappropriate) but anyways she then told me that I was an asshole and that her dad was dying of cancer. I told her that I was so sorry and that if she was lying I would know because I was still in contact with Trevor who I had just found is her only male cousin but she swore. That night I found out how deep she had hurt me. I drank 2L of coke and played UNO on ps4 until 8 am crying myself to sleep with a broken controller (and I don't ever cry). One day I catch with Trevor and ask him if his uncle was dying and he said no and left. fast forward two months into easter time 2018 after I had just lost my ps4 for 2 months (that story is in another Reddit post) and I get a random Friend request from let's call him Gabe. So Gabe (i later found out gabe was her older brother) joins the party and immediately goes off his fucking nut and yells ""listen cunt stay the fuck away from my family and stop spreading shit you pathetic cunt, Trevor had a fucking panic attack because of you"" he leaves and I put the pieces together and realize Trevor had a panic attack after he thought his uncle was fucking dying and it wasn't even my fault but I wasn't gonna tell him that so I just took it. No bullshit 15 minutes later he joins back and goes ""hold on were you friends with (Mia's PSN account), oh sorry mate, just coming to check if you are all good I went pretty fucking crazy, anyways catcha"" so then I thought some more Trevor must have mentioned that I said to him that she had told me that and then it must have bitten her in the ass. (That is just a theory though) anyways yesterday I checked on her account she had made everything private but the one thing I could see was the music that she was listening to the album was The Matchbox Twenty Collection and the song was unwell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WziA88-n02k) and another song in the album was my name when i listened to the song I don't know if it was just 4 am me but I felt like it was her talking to me directly this line in particular ""But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell I know right now you can't tell But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see A different side of me""

It made sense her parents never paid attention to her she was always online and she lied about everyone she was friends with to get the attention of her cousins and other strangers.

I have no clue why but I miss her so fucking much and some nights even though this all went down last year I just think about her when I know she is a liar like most of my other posts this is just to get it off my chest but if you made it the end of this text wall have a good night.",15Jan2019,1

It's common to be sat at a pub with your mate chatting about football and you could possibly not talk about anything else in life that's actually important.

I've been depressed for a good 6/7 years and been suicidal several times during this period. My will to live is severely diminishing day by day. It's hard to picture myself living past 30 (i'm 21 right now). I just don't see it. There's versions of what could be, but I don't see how I'll ever get there the way I am right now. 

I'm nothing but a burden to everyone who loves me. My parents, my friends... they're all sick of it, sick of me. They're sick of dealing with me. And i don't blame them because i'm sick of dealing with me too. 

I want to get help. I want to be better. But it's so hard when I have school and I want to do things that normal kids my age do. I know drinking and getting high is the last thing I should be doing in this state of mind but everything is just so overwhelming and I feel like I'm running out of time to make things right. I feel like, I already fucked up my chances at having a normal life.

This is not a pity party just stating some general facts: I was bullied for the majority of my adolescences, starting in maybe 5th grade and gradually getting worse, and worse, and worse. Home wasn't a safe place for me either with my parents fighting all day everyday, and me fighting with them as well. I was 14 when I first started smoking weed, and by 15/16 I was smoking more and more daily. I'm 21 and still smoking daily. So my brain is basically fried at this point. 

Anyways, yeah. That's all, I just wanted to vent. I probably won't kill myself because i'm too scared but I really just don't want to exist anymore.

I imagine a troubled relationship with parents because of that and start feeling bad about it.

This habit has also extended to other spheres. My grandparents visit us during winters and are more than 85 years old. I start thinking about whether they'll visit us again or not and I start imagining worst possible things. I often get emotional thinking about it when I am talking with them.

The bad part in my case is that scenarios I imagine are actually possible which makes me think they are bound to happen and I start seeing things from that perspective. I constantly worry about it.

99,"Hey mentalhealth,

so I’ve thought a bit about whether or not I should post, but realised I really need some kind of point that I can work on. I feel like I don’t know what exactly the reason of my issue is, nor how to tackle the problem, so here we go:

I think I have jealousy issues. I don’t get jealous just seeing other people in their success or happiness, rather the opposite, I don’t begrudge them at all. What comes to my mind is usually “good for you!” or nothing at all.

Now what I really have a (mental) problem with, is when someone (no matter what my relation is to them) complains about their situation while having a even slightly slightly “better life” than I do. I try to always keep a positive mindset, so seeing somebody else go on about something that they‘re annoyed about really makes me feel like they’re dealing with “first world problems”, which triggers anger inside of me. I really don’t know how to handle it, but want to get rid of it to the point that I can just chuckle over someone nagging at their life, instead of trying to teach them a lesson over humbleness.

I have an example at hand: Just recently, I’ve had an argument with my SO over something trivial, making me feel totally foolish. She’s been on vacation (somewhere sunny), and was somewhat pissed off over the fact that a sightseeing attraction had a huge queue, which ruined her plans to go there. In turn she texted me, telling me that she’ll just have to go get some fast food, adding “fml”. I felt so annoyed about the fact that she has it better than me, that I started an argument I shouldn’t have. In my head, all I could think is “I’m sitting here in the cold, fasting, working my ass off, and she has the audacity to be annoyed for getting burgers?

My behaviour is applicable to many other instances, when I’d feel rage for other people complaining about their lives. This has just been the cherry on top, and since **I really do not want to jeopardize my relationship,** it is high time for me to tackle this.

What can I do to stop this kind of reaction from my side? What do I even call this, is there a name for this kind of behaviour? I just want to be a better version of myself, and this issue has honestly been holding me back too often.

I sincerely hope there is someone who can give me insight on this. Thank you so much for reading so far.

I'm naturally a frugal person - and I'm getting a bit of flack from my counselor about it. The comments something like ""you should be broke in your 20s"". I disagree.  I can see her point which is to have a bit more fun - I can CERTAINLY work on that - but I think it is a bit off putting.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my major things I'm working on is a career change. I've been confused on my path but lately have decided to go down a career path that I think will be more rewarding than the last. With that said, I still have some lingering doubts and I'm considering others (which take a ton more time investment). The latest comment has been in regards to myers briggs. She made an offhand comment about it and I asked what she thought of it. She says she finds it a useful tool to help understand people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I revealed what I get it tests and she found it surprising. She started to comment that based on my type, it sounds like I'm going down the wrong career path since ""it doesn't fit typically with your type"". It any case, I'm walking out of a lot of sessions a bit more confused than the last. It could be that she is challenging me and its making me wonder - but at the same time I find it stressful and perhaps unproductive.

112,"So here’s what’s up. When I get really fuckin upset, I’m talking ballistic, it’s like I change as a person completely. I start having a completely different thought process and it’s as though my whole psyche changes. I generally love life. I love the little things and the big things. I love having fun basically. But when I have these states, I can’t seem to really remember what I felt like afterwords. I just recall myself feeling very depressed and angry. So some time ago when I got in my faze again, I decided to jot down my thoughts as though I was talking to my future self. This is the result: ( some context: this specific rage was caused by a huge but regular fight I had with my father where we almost ended up smashing each others heads in. Ps more context: I also talk about weight loss and xanax in my notes. Tbh I dunno where the weight loss thing comes from cause I’m in pretty good shape and feel good about it and as for the Xanax, there was a time in my life when I abused it) Don’t forget the kind of person he is. He throws these fights on purpose. He does it to punish you. He knows you hate yourself. I want it all to end but I’m too afraid to die. I am a fucking pussy but I want peace. I want to take all the drugs and be in a zone of utter mindlessness forever. I don’t want me anymore. I want the dimension where I can exist without having to know anyone or ever feel pain again. Coming to the actual conclusion that no one will ever understand you ever no fucking matter what because everyone is just going through their own shit is a tough realization. It really means we’re all alone. No one will ever understand us. No one will ever truly know the pain we felt. No matter the movie you portray it in, or the autobiographical book you write. At the end of the day. You live and die with your pain. And you never get to share it.i finally understand why people cut themselves. I never got it before. Why the fuck would anyone do that. What a pussy attention calling act. But I fucking get it now. It feels fucking amazing. Fucking Nirvana. When all you feel is fucking misery and wanting to die. To feel pain instead, real physical pain, feels like heaven on earth. I think I cracked a fucking smile in the mirror while I slit my wrist. And oh god how close I was to ending it. I wanted to so fucking bad but I’m too scared. I don’t want to cringe at the sight of my arm split down the middle.  I would be okay on passing with pills though. That’d be a fucking amazing way. Fuck me I need to try heroin. I fucking need it. I haven’t tried it yet but I’m craving it. I want to die to heroin mixed with fentynal. The perfect death.
Don’t forget this sadness tomorrow when you wake up. Read this and feel these feelings again. I’m tired of letting them go. It hurts more every time I have to get them again. If I’m always like this I can’t let anyone affect me. Read this and remind yourself that nothing will ever be good. You are destined for nothing. You will die young and everyone will have expected it. Your mother gave up on you. Your father HATES you. Your sister is the only one who gives a fuck AND YOU TREAT HER HOW THEY TREAT YOU. I DONT WANT TO BE THIS WAY. I DONT WANT TO BE LIKE THEM WHY AM I LIKE THEM WHY JESUS FUCK THIS IS THE ONLY THING I DONT WANT TO BE. IM EATING THEIR SHIT AND CRAMMING IT DOWN MY SISTERS THROAT AFTER ITS GONE THROUGH ME. IM JUST AS BAD AS THEM. what if she feels the same way as me. What if she feels no one will ever understand. I can understand. Atleast a part of it. She understands me too. She’s the only one. Read this everyday you stay living your worthless life. She is everything. Die to protect her. She is the only one who will ever truly love you. Don’t ruin it. Jesus fuck please don’t ruin it. I’m begging you.
From tomorrow stop fucking eating so much. Eat the essentials to stay alive for fucks sake and that’s it. I’ve packed on so fucking much. I need my fucking Xanax. That shit kept the weight away life a charm. I looked fucking good back then. Jesus it’s been a while. I need to be high. I always need to be high",15Jan2019,1
113,That's all I ever hear from my family. And they're right. I'm 30 and living in my parents garage unemployed for the last 3 years. I'm the loser everyone loves to hate. I don't like or want to be like this. I'm like this because I've had severe mental health problems since I was very young that went without help. Idk for sure but I have reason to believe I was molested at a very young age and I am very likely on the autism spectrum. I don't know if my family sees my mental health problems and doesn't care or if they just don't care enough to see them. I was pretty much neglected as a kid. My parents did what they had to do to keep me alive but never bothered to teach my anything. I did horrible in school because I was so anxious around everybody that I couldn't even walk past people without my muscles tensing up and walking very awkwardly because of it. I also pissed myself in class once because I was too shy to ask to go to the bathroom. I'm just saying that so you have an example of how severe my issues are. I've had jobs before and was good at them. Stocking shelves at retail stores and doing brainless factory work. I made some friends as a teenager while working but was always the odd guy out and I don't speak to anybody any more. I quit all my jobs because of my mental health. I feel guilty for quitting because idk if my reasons for quitting are justifiable. What stressed me out most about my jobs is they were all doing repetitive tasks daily/weekly with very little mental stimulation and eventually It would be too much for me to handle. I also have trouble relating with people so it's tough to be around people who always remain strangers even though you see them every day. I want a job and I need a job but Idk what to do about it. I've had like 2 interviews in these 3 years and one was at a place my friend worked at and had the boss give me an interview. Soon as I left the place the boss called my friend saying how weird I was. I'm too screwed up mentally to go out in the world and do what I need to do. Even when I had a job I was too unfit mentally to advance my life. I've been isolated in my room for the past 3 years with very little human interaction or even going outside. I live with my parents but most of the time I can't even stand to be in the same room as them or look in their direction. We have no relationship. I think about suicide a lot but idk if it'll actually happen. I tried finding hobbies like reading and exercise to improve myself but it's hard to keep it up when there's no improvement on my situation. I tried therapy once but they didn't seem to even listen and I didn't have enough money to shop around and find somebody that might actually help. I live in a small redneck town in florida with few resources and a mental health system that loves to create opioid addicts. Idk what to do with myself. I don't want to be like this forever. ,15Jan2019,1
114,"To preface this, I have booked an appointment with a doctor to figure out if something is actually wrong but due to the state of the NHS I have to wait a while to get that appointment. Just posting here to see if anyone has suffered anything similar and can help me figure out if something is wrong.

I’m 21, female and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for about 6 years. I take medication for it and while I’ve had some bad times as a teenager I’m mostly stable now. However, within the last 6 months or so (it’s hard to tell exactly when it started) I’ve started feeling more tired and lethargic than usual. Everything centres around the next time I’ll be able to go home and lie down. In addition to this, I’ve been feeling increasingly demotivated to do anything, get distracted and bored very easily, and experience severe brain fog. This is a problem for me at university as I used to be extremely motivated to work hard and now I can hardly focus on anything or think about anything too complicated without the brain fog kicking in and muddling up my thoughts. As I said, I started noticing it around summer time and it’s gradually been getting worse since then, within the last month especially. Lately I’ve also been more confused and forgetful, like I’ll go into a trance and do something unintentionally and then be confused as to why I did it (kinda like going into a room and forgetting why you went in there but with pretty much everything). I’m not sure if any of these symptoms are linked to my depression and if I’m just having an episode, but as I’ve said I’ve been diagnosed for a long time and I’ve never experienced anything like this before, coupled with the fact that I feel any emotional symptoms like sadness. I’m worried it’s a sign of something more serious, especially since the symptoms are getting worse. It may not sound like that big a deal but I literally don’t want to do anything at the moment but it’s so debilitating to feel so tired and foggy all the time. So if anyone who’s experienced the same is out there, please help! ",15Jan2019,1

117,"Hi,  

I was recently watching a film where the Dr's are role playing with patients, experimenting with them.  It reminded me of my former detainment and they were role playing with me.  I was still self aware and not delusional, I thought those people were kind of sick f-cks.  I could see it as a useful tool to build on what you know of your patients delusions but it may be unethical next to reasoning with them.

These folks were trying to play along with me, it was a bit deranged.  It was a long long time ago and transpired over me joking about re-incarnation and religious stuff.  I was never trying to be literal, people took it literally though.  I mean, I surely didn't take religion seriously.  

That is one thing I would tell others, take it somewhat more seriously than I did, unless you want to burn in hell.  I've met numerous people that wanted to put me away, I was just joking.

118,"A few years ago, I was an awful friend to the one person who cared about me the most. I said and did awful things, I allowed my ex and his friends to encourage it; and even though my best friend and I made amends, I still hate myself for it. 

I hate myself for the things I said, I hate myself for letting myself get so carried away with saying such spiteful things and airing out dirty laundry that should have never been told...

I almost lost my best friend because of it. And I almost lost myself, because I was building myself up for a potential suicide honestly. 

But at the time I thought, “nothing matters anymore, nothings going to change. Just throw it all to the wind and don’t look back.” And that’s what I tried to do. I numbed myself from the turmoil I was in, the depression and the nagging voices of loneliness and sadness. 

I hate myself for doing it all. I regret it, and I still hate myself. I will use it to beat myself up and remind myself of how shitty of a person I am, how so undeserving and how I distaste everything about myself. 

My best friend has forgiven me and we’ve moved past it all, but two years later I still use it to remind myself of how much of a shitty person I am, how I wish I could take it all back and do right, when everyone I hurt has forgiven me, but I am yet to forgive myself ",15Jan2019,1
119,"Hey for a little background I’ll start with:

I’ve been having CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) for a few months and started antidepressants around 5 months ago as GP felt I was suffering with anxiety and depression.

(I’m based in England. I referred myself to the well-being team to see a therapist)

I’ve had my last session of CBT and my therapist was concerned that although I completed every task and achievements I set myself, I still feel the same as before even with the combination of therapy and medication. 

I saw the Gp today and explained that sometimes I’m not sure when things I feel or do is depression or just myself and I wanted a therapist I could really discuss things with and find out what is up. GP thought I would benefit from a referral to the community mental health team as she explained that the tablets won’t work if I’m not actually suffering with depression so there may be a personality disorder.  

That’s all fine by me but when I’m alone I think I do need help and when I speak to someone professional I feel like I’m just being a hypochondriac and “trying” to be diagnosed with something. I feel like I’m making a deal out of nothing. Does anyone else feel like that?

TLDR I saw gp to say tablets and therapy not working and I feel like I’m exaggerating or hypochondriac. Am I being paranoid?",15Jan2019,1

There's no traumatic event from my past.

And yet I can't shake this overwhelming feeling of  emptiness, pointlessness and hopelessness. 

It makes me feel like a coward. A loser. There's people out there with arthritis, cancer, limbs missing, people going through traumatic events and grief. And they manage. They push forward. Why can't I do that? There's no reason for me to be depressed.

And if it was just a chemical imbalance wouldn't the drugs have worked by now?

What I find myself asking is: is it okay for it to be such a big part of who I am? Looking back, I’ve seen that even as a kid, before the issues hit, I used to have a kind of vaguely unhappy little spark in the back of my head. I’d sometimes feel vaguely unhappy for no good reason. These days, I’ve even had someone say they were attracted to my “brooding” personality. I don’t know whether that says more about me or them, but it’s a point on the scoreboard for how big a part of me all this is. It’s weird.

At the moment I'm living day to day in my gap year. I really don't like my job and I'm trying to get more exercise in before work (10:30 start). I can't get myself into a routine of going to sleep early enough to wake up for it though.

I'm normally spend a lot of time kayaking but due to yet another injury I can't be doing that for a while and I don't get scan results for a few weeks yet. I want to get motivated to go to the gym more which I really enjoy once I'm there but I'm always too tired for it and now lacking motivation. 

I feel like I'm starting to slip into depression as I never want tomorrow to come which is the main reason I keep staying up late. I keep making myself excuses to stay up. But it just means I never get up early enough in the morning to get anything done and I'm tired all the time.

So I’ll go from birth to now, and sum up my life. I had always been happy and confident until 2nd grade, in 2nd grade is when my uncle died, we were very close and this impacted me a lot, I was still happy, just, a little less, then things were like that until 4th grade, when my grandfather died, we again, were very close and this is when I started to become the stupid little crybaby I am now, I cried at a lot of things then, but until 6th grade everything kept going like that (a bit less happy, and crying all of the time), then 6th grade rolled around, and I got really close to my friends, they have always been here to back me up, but anyway in 6th grade I started getting bullied, a lot, one time kids threw rocks at me, and I wouldn’t stop crying, that was the day I swore to never cry in public again, I saw myself as weak, and stupid, I got distant and distracted in 6th, (according to my closest friend), but then I had hope, 7th grade was the best year of my life, I met my girlfriend, and I had some of the best times hanging out with friends, and  generally acting like teenagers. Then 8th grade came and I thought it was going to be amazing, but on September 13th... my dad died... we were very close and now, I hate myself, everything I do, everything I make, I hate, my friends are the only thing that bring me happiness anymore. I’m getting bored with everything (video games, social media, good food) aside from being with friends, I feel terrible, and don’t want to feel this way anymore, I just want to be happy, when I’m alone, and now I get anxiety over the smallest of things, my life is great aside from the death, so why can’t I be great too...
