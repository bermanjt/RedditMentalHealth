A little background. Married to my high school sweetheart 21 years, 2 kids both in their late teens.

I have been feeling out of sorts for a few years. I have just been down now for a couple of years. I try my best to hide my feelings, to make the best of everything I do with my family. I have tried my hardest to not show I feel down, and just in-interested in things.

I have done my best to keep feelings hidden and be an active part of my family, but I know they can tell I am not myself. I know my wife has asked me several times if everything is ok, I just try to smile and play it off. But deep down she knows. My children are both older but I am sure they know and it effects them as well.

I really can not turn to my parents there is a large stigma about mental illness and I really don't want my parents to know anything. I also don't have many close friends, I have always chosen to spend my time with my family rather than anyone else.

I am afraid to tell them about how I feel, I don't want my wife to worry that she has done something or has caused me to feel this way, because it is not her or anything really with my family. I can not really put my finger on why I feel the way I do, just everything feels.... Blah

I have a few questions I really don't have many answers for.

1. How can I tell my wife how I feel, if I can not even describe why I feel the way I do, I can't tell if I have ""depression"" or am in a ""mid life crissis"" or something else entirely. I really don't want to be a burden or worry her, this is why I have waited for a few years hopping I would feel better.
2. I accept I am going to need some help getting healthy I really can not keep on this way much longer. How does someone from a really small town seek help? Online resources ect.
3. I guess I really just want to be happy again and enjoy life. Its getting to hard to fake it anymore, and I know it is damaging the people around me, which just adds to my down feelings and it becomes a feedback loop. I just don't know what to do, or who to turn to.",26Jul2019,2

2,"So me and my therapist have recently been discussing the possibility of a Dissociative Identity Disorder diagnosis. The problem comes because it can be hard to tell if my symptoms are from that, or my drug use. So she suggested I try to be sober for 3 months so we can get a baseline of my behavior. The idea immediately turned me off, but I want to get better, so I decided to try to start with 21 days. Today is day one, and I already wanna break, and kinda am. My feelings of emptiness are just so overwhelming, and nothing feels real, I feel like I could explode out of my chest. All I want to do is get high, at least have a drink. I put some liquor in the freezer to get ready to drink in a bit, I know I shouldn’t, but atleast I’m not buying drugs. I just feel so hopeless. Even one day with my mind clear is too much for me to handle, how could I ever try and do this forever? I just want to get better, and recently it’s been really hard to see that happening. I don’t know, I just needed to vent I guess. Thanks to anyone that read this.",26Jul2019,21
3, Mentally ive been dry lately. my thoughts have been all over the place and mentally thats far from what it was. But in this dream my thoughts seemed so well layered. It was weird I could actually hear my thoughts and they were so easy to grab on too. it occurred to me that my dream was from my past and that was how i use to be able to think. Nowadays i dont hear that voice when I think and some times i have to think the same thing about 8 times just to comprehend what im thinking. It effects me everyday to be honest. I should probably add that ive had a good amount of experience with psychedelics in the past. If anyone has felt anything similar to this or knows anything about it and where i should go for help please let me know.,26Jul2019,1

5,"I recently saw my psychiatrist and I told him my paranoia has been getting worse. So he spent a good 10 minutes telling me that believing in ghosts was not normal, ghosts don't exist, believing in them will just make me worse, and I'm perpetuating everything wrong with me. I felt attacked. Who is he? It wasn't his place to say that.

7,"I must say, I much rather live in depression than mania. I don’t find melancholy bad at all - I love it. 

I get the feeling when I let myself sink into sadness, that my thoughts are much more profound and interesting. I don’t get caught in the pettiness of everyday life.

Is it problematic to love sadness and loneliness? It makes me feel strong.",26Jul2019,1
8,"I watched a video on 'how ugly men are treated blackpill' and i kinda realized it applies to me. The philosophy has a logical concluding stating ""if this applies to you - you can cope or rope"".

9,"I think very negatively but I've never felt this suicidal before. I didnt get enough sleep last night and I had McDonalds so I looked horrible all day. How I look plays a really big part in how I feel and how my day goes plus I also work at McDonalds so I had to talk to people and a lot of them were rude and I feel like its cos I look like shit. I feel really insecure, I'm dark skinned so I kept telling myself that's why. I literally feel horrible and if i keep feeling this way idk how ik gonna carry on. I hate being a woman especially a black one. I'm decently attractive but I dont have much going on for myself so my looks have always brought people in especially men and I always seek this validation so I always wanna look perfect. I hate that I'm this way. Should I seek therapy? I'm trying to use God but it didnt help at all today and talking about how ugly I think I am is just weird and looks insecure. People treat me differently based on how I look e.gn my hair I fucking hate it even my parents dont like my natural hair.",26Jul2019,1
11,"Happiness is a state that is always ascending. You keep growing and climbing up to the top, and keep getting happier. But then when you fall, you fall to the very, very bottom. You fall hard, and then you start to lie there. Perhaps this happens to everyone. Everything hurts, you've lost your progress. You look up and see the infinately long ladder that you had gotten so far on. Having to start over is the most difficult thing that you can imagine. There seems to be no point to try again, because of the likelihood that you will descend again. There doesn't seem to be an end to the ladder, anyways. You've lost the desire to keep going. You lie on the cold, hard floor- but you gain a sense of comfort. It's comfortable down here. You're familiar with this feeling, and this view. You're familiar with not wanting to eat. You're familiar with wanting to be asleep. It's simple here. It begins to become harder to care enough to grab the ladder, and start climbing again. But you always do.",26Jul2019,1
12,"I am 20. Working in London but from Ireland. My girlfriend, also 20, lives in Ireland. I feel like without her there is no meaning to my life. But even though I trust her, whenever she goes out I feel a wave of anxiety and fears fill my body. I get upset and worried. 
Sometimes I just start crying randomly. Even when she's not out. Like I can't help it. I have immense fear of not being good enough for her or that she'll get bored of me. We have been going out for over a year now and it feels pretty serious. I am wondering if these are just normal feelings that people don't talk about, or if there is something more that may be affecting me",26Jul2019,2
13,"I have this thing where whenever I feel stressed/ashamed/remorseful/chastised my body physically clamps up, I get nauseous, and my throat tightens.

If yes, is it something that could be improved with therapy?",26Jul2019,1
14,"I recently had to cut ties with my dad because of his behavior. I'm sure I contributed to it, but I couldn't handle his constant narcissism. I've been told and have come to terms with the fact that this is somewhat natural, but I can't help but feel like I've done something horribly wrong and I'm at fault here. I'm wondering, if you've had to cut ties with family, how did you deal with it? how did you cope with the fact that you very well may never speak to someone you spent your life around?",26Jul2019,1
15,"I’m struggling. I’ve been struggling for weeks. I live in Puerto Rico, for those who don’t know we have been experiencing a lot of political/social events following up to our now ex-governor’s resignation. This alone has taken a huge toll on my mental health. I’ve felt what I like to call “emotionally backed-up” because so many things have been happening (protesting, police brutality, corruption, gaslighting from our own government) and I have no one outside of social media to discuss these things with. 

I started crying tonight while making myself a smoothie. My dad was telling me how my half-sister protested for the governor’s resignation while she’s living in Colorado. Then I started thinking about how I live with my dad but he doesn’t know anything about me. Not my interests, not my opinions, my likes/dislikes, it’s like we’re strangers. It’s more or less the same with my mom. It hurts me, I feel so alone. When I try to just initiate a fucking conversation I’m mostly ignored. So I go days, weeks, without talking to them, we live in the same stupid house and I feel like a ghost. I feel so irrelevant, so unnecessary, so out of place. I wish they would at least answer me when I ask them a question. I wish they would try to get to know me as a fucking human being. Then I feel guilty for not showing them affection, or wanting to be around them. But am i really the one to blame?

I just hate my existence. I hate being alive. Nothing feels worth staying alive for. I just want to feel loved, like I’m being listened to, like I’m not just a waste of space. I’m just venting, I’m too scared to actually just put an end to all this stupid shit.",26Jul2019,1

17,"Hi mental health community,

Young adult son here with a mid 70s mother with undiagnosed BPD, but all the tell tale signs from suicidal threats to fear of abandonment and strong unpredictable emotions. 

Recently her BPD has been getting worse but the whole family is scared to confront her. I’m very worried she’s going to kill herself or my father, her husband and I’m not sure what to do. 

She’s in therapy but still has regular suicide threats (every year before to now every few months). She has been berating my father to get her pills that will help her kill her self for several years now and says how she hates life with him and her children, so finally he handed her some in the next suicide attempts and said to do it. 

She stopped after a few pills and said she wants to go to the hospital, got committed under an involuntary, and got out after being transferred to voluntary and setting an appointment with her therapist. 

One week later she tells everyone she was never suicidal and is now pressing charges against her husband for trying to abet suicide. It’s important to note he is the only person who cares for her regularly, is the only one of the two who has a regular income, and they live together in an apartment. 

Given the rapid cycling BPD and escalating threats against herself and trying to get her husband to kill her, I’m very worried she’s going to somehow kill them both or kill her self and set him up for abetting. 

She and I speak very little but given her committal I’ve been trying to reach out more, but now just get threatening texts from her accusing me of abandoning her. 

Would love anyone’s thoughts how to deal with this or keep myself sane...much love. X",26Jul2019,0

19,"At my lowest point in my life a couple years back, my best friend sat me down during a breakdown and told me, 'you need to put your mental illness in a box and put it in a place that doesn't define the whole you'. 

That really resonated with me till this day.
We all have bad days and good days. And I admit, I more often than not have bad days than good days.

On bad days, I can be grumpy and have many cry sessions. On good days, I am 100% my own sarcastic, bubbly and clumsy self.

What she said was more than just 'don't label yourself as depression, anxiety, bipolar etc'. My best friend meant that whenever you have your lowest moments, remember that it is not you as an individual with emotions andfull of life, it is a mental illness that is debilitating and a bitch of a struggle. 

You are your own person. You have so much worth and you will do SO much good in this world.",26Jul2019,3
20,"I never had any substantive mental health issues until some traumatic events happened in my life. I’m 23 years old and at 19 my mother died of a drug overdose. We don’t know if it was intentional or an accident but I’ve always thought she committed suicide. This whole situation led to a falling out between many members of my family and I haven’t seen my grandpa or my aunt or cousins since shortly after. I try to pass off like I can handle everything that happened, but I think it was too much. Since then, I’ve deteriorated. I’m nothing like I use to be.  I feel generally abandoned and that I don’t have the love in my life that other people do. There’s just nothing that can make this right.

What’s really getting worse is my anxiety. It’s to the point where I can’t handle almost any situation. It started off where I was just bad in stressful situations (like job interviews) but now I find it hard to do things I want to. I get anxious just meeting friends for breakfast to the point where I’m having involuntary physical reactions (face twitching, going red, heart racing, voice cracking). It’s hurting my relationships and my work.

23,"I battled with severe depression for most of my life, but finally in 2018 I was able to get off the meds and I actually felt happiness for the first time. Later last month I felt it all again, and I wish I was just dreaming and I tried so hard to feel happy but couldn’t... and I miss happiness, so I wrote this. I know no one is going to read this but I wanna register...: 

“Depression came to visit me again...
I spent my day wondering what was going on. Scared to life because her visit was never too kind. She is not a friend and I didn’t want her to stay. As I sat down having lunch, my eyes were slowly burning, I felt tears streaming down my face and I had no idea why. Emptiness was all I could feel and I kept telling my mind to please not let it win, “fight for me, produce serotonin...” because I have nothing on me, no strength, no fight, no desire. I felt my heart burning. I kindly ask my mind to help me out, because I battled with depression for a long time, and that battle caused me infinite bruises. I spent my day trying to fight it again, but at the end of the day depression looked straight to my face and as I asked her to leave, she hugged me and said she actually never did. Depression did not come to visit me again, depression never left me anyway.”",26Jul2019,3
24,"(This is long) I don't even know where to start. I'm on a humanitarian mission in South Carolina near Myrtle Beach with poor reception. Hopefully this gets out. Btw, I've made one other post on here which I received help. Maybe I can get more. I've split this up into parts. 

I'm a male and have been working out to work on my upper body strength. I can say that I am a built guy and I'm a great public speaker, this is important for context. 

1. For a while, I've been hearing voices that tell me to do things or say things. Just about anything can trigger it. The voices tell me to either throw something, punch a hole in the wall, break someone's nose, or scream profanity and slurs. I fall victim to these voices and my mother has admitted that I scare her. 
One night, a week ago ish, I tried to sleep, but kept hearing things and started seeing things. I saw outlines of people standing over me, a dragon across the room, and a goblin head out my window. I know it sounds wild, but I just cowered in fear. The next morning, I woke up to my mom wondering why I slept with my door open because that's unusual in our house. I just screamed at her and had no clue who she was. I pulled the sheets over my head and hid and screamed even more until I understand what was going on. 

I guess my mind is exploiting the disconnect I have with my parents. For some reason I can't tell them I love them. I want to, but can't muster up the nerve. 

2. For my entire life, I've been Lutheran. Lately, I've just stopped caring about my religion. I go on trips just for the community and to remain social. I feel like a hostage at this point. Everytime I do something, I can no longer see my god in the things I do. It's just me existing really. 

3. I work from home for my dad's business. However, I'm a reckless spender. I only make my internet and car payments and that's it. That's all I save for. 

4. All throughout highschool, I seldom fell in love with girls. It's very rare where I can say a girl has stolen my heart because of how patient I am. Well my heart got stolen a few months ago and then was stepped on. This was only the 2nd time I liked a girl. 

5. I try to talk to my friends about my problems in part 1, but they just tell me the usual, ""lol don't kill yourself."" My friend circle has shruken down to 3 people and I can feel it shrink even further. 

Conclusion, I have nothing. I've lost my relationship with my parents, my friends, my love life, my god, and I am broke. See you all in therapy.

25,I'm on two new medications and the side effects are horrible. I am on day three and the past two weeks have been horrible with panic attacks.

The VA has been helping me the best they can but I feel like I'm losing my self completely.

26,"Where I live m(23) I have some good friends, family, and the medical attention I need. I feel like I've been continuously improving my life with small steps over the past couple years. I'm not where I want to be personally yet, but I'm progresssing well.

Things would be looking especially optimistic, but where I live doesn't really have many oppprtunities for my chosen profession. I could pivot somewhat and have an easier time, but I'm not happy working at a job where I can't create or design. I'm a creative guy.

In the coming months I may to need to make a choice between the professional career I want to lead and my relationships and support. I don't make friends easily and I'm leery of almost restarting with new medical professionals.

I don't think there's an easy answer for this. It has increasing felt lately like I'll have to choose between working on what I love, or the proximity and reliability of my current support network. I worry that settling professionally now will make it very difficult  to try to break into that creative side later.

People often tell me that I should make those big moves while I'm young. I think that makes sense for many people, including some of my friends and acquaintances I've seen move away the past couple years. That said, I worry about regressing and undoing the progress of the past couple years; but I don't feel like I can make that judgement reliably, part of my mental health issues includes an aversion to risk.

For anyone who's done this, what kind of questions might the doctor ask, and how can I prepare? I'm mostly worried that I'll just be told to exercise or something and not get any additional help. Also, I'm not always very aware of what's going on with my health (a nurse once asked me if I'd had a runny nose recently and I said 'I don't know') so I'm concerned I won't know how to answer all of her questions.

30,"Just as the titles says, I'm unfortunately resistant and although I have people who love me (mainly my mom and sisters), I'm really trudging through this alone. I've been put on oodles of antidepressants and antipsychotics, hospitalized, missed a month of work, and had family members claim I just, ""Don't want to get better."" Oh and the thing that triggered it all: Losing extremely close friends and my sole support system built up to deal with the onslaught of constant abuse from both my dad and step mom. The second part of this is the trigger + my current situation. 

The cause of my breakdown was over something stupid I did like rushing into getting my first apartment with someone in the friend group that I wasn't necessarily close with. We knew each other well.. for years so I thought, ""Hey, people get apartments with total strangers right?? Well she's no stranger and I'm sure we can sort through any personal problems."" Okay, people get apartments with total strangers, people with anxious-avoidant, suicidal, highly depressed, ptsd wreck of a human being who vomits when out of my house don't. Things didn't go well. For everyone. When they say, ""don't get places with friends,"" I think they really mean it. I fully know what I have done wrong and what could have changed. It kills me on the daily. How long ago was this? 7 months. Full half a year where I can hardly function as a person. Suicide comes and goes now, but was DAILY for 6 months. And I'm tired of the ""fight for suicide prevention"" when really nobody wants to stand there with you and walk through the recovery process. If you can't tell, I'm incredibly bitter. Nothing helps. And ""going to the local mall"" doesn't help when I have crushing social anxiety. I can't even open up fully to my therapist. I tell her my past, but I'm too worried about making her uncomfortable. Even knowing I'm paying her for this service. Idk. I really have little hope for recovery. My anxiety prevents me from doing anything social (without someone I know being there), but loneliness is truly the worst. Plus the mental health field... doesn't know what to do with me. This is so rambly god I'm sorry. I know this fight is on my shoulders and I'm trying my best every day. I take care of the house, get out to the gym or somewhere in town with my sister. I have a job lined up next week, too. It's taken A LOT to build up to this point. I even moved crossed country to live with my mom. I drove straight there. Stopped once to vomit and sleep in my car. Logic said get a hotel, but anxiety brain said, ""If you stop, you won't make it. You won't get the stability to get out of bed again."" Bless anyone who has read this far.

31,"Dear People,

&amp;#x200B;

I am 28 years old. I still live with my aunt and uncle. I wake up every day and I feel the same way, cloudy minded with no energy, motivation or dignity. I have no relationships, certainly not anything intimate or wholesome. My childhood was rocky, to say the least. I don't feel any positive emotions unless I consume drugs. In a world designed to make you feel worthless...I already feel that way, internally. I just took a math class, spent most every waking minute studying. If I had passed I would have received an associate degree. I just found out that I failed by four points, this is my fourth attempt. I'm starting to feel that college may not have ever been my path. I have had jobs, but my consistent level of energy, and low mood always prevents me from holding them down. Tomorrow, I will wake up, feeling worse than I did yesterday. I want so badly to reverse this and make all of this disappointment worth it. All day my mind cycles through my short comings, how sad and pathetic I feel. My confidence is so fragile, and it's so hardwired, I see no way to override this inferiority, all though I can consciously see all of the benefits of feeling stronger, especially the benefits for my family, friends, and society as a whole. But even that, can't over power how helpless and weak I feel to be. The only thing that keeps me going is hope. But these feelings, they are the realest feelings ive ever had, the darkest feelings Ive ever had. I don't know what to do. I know I can find a job, but Im so paralyzed by the thought that Ill always feel this way, it throws off my actions, because they seem futile, as in, why not just end it, instead of grinding just to grind, but never experience any joy. If my feelings never change, then Ill never have the postive balance outside of work. I know this rather pessimistic but these beliefs are deeply rooted, and my experience thus far doesn't refute them. Any advice? I am aware that I'm in a state of depression(and through drugs I have seen some semblance of peace and contentment, even happiness. LSD was a crazy experience, I saw myself without any negativity attached, and I wonder if that is just the drug, or if Im always what I saw, but my vision is blocked by all of my negative feelings and thought patterns.) I wish I could break through. Sorry for the randomness. Any advice would be awesome. Thanks, I hope that you are doing well, and if you also experience anything I have described, feel free to message me, I would love to discuss stuff (i don't do it often)",26Jul2019,1
32,"Hello, fellow human here. I’ve had feelings of anxiety and had a mildly rough childhood (split parents, taking on responsibility for siblings at an early age, never really been provided for past the bare minimums.)

Started dating a girl a couple months ago. 
She has attempted suicide a couple times, has narcolepsy, and has been diagnosed with BPD and PTSD due to events from her upbringing. 

There are a lot of her actions that she blames/ associates with those illnesses that I just can’t understand. I’ve been in shifty places in my life and have been in scenarios i wouldn’t wish on anyone. Yet I trudge through. I don’t need medication to leave the house, can function well in society. 

Will someone please change my point of view that these disorders aren’t just a stem of not being mentally strong? I know that sounds really insensitive but after hearing the situations that caused this I feel as though I can equate similar situations of my own experience and I do just fine. 

Tl:dr can’t sympathize or empathize with girlfriends mental illness due to the fact that I’ve had similar stimuli and function just fine.",26Jul2019,1
33,"I'm 30, physically disabled and mentally. I can not live on my own but in a year or 2, public housing will have me ready to move in. I am so depressed after hearing I will have less then 6 months to live again after a new cancer diagnosis (14th time but this time it's much more deadly)

I decided an emotional support pet would help me live these days out in peace and happiness. I chose a small bunny from a local breeder because of low costs, easy care, and of course how cute he is!

I struggled this weekend helping my dad move furniture, especially after seeing him look like he'd have a heart attack. My step mom bought a 80 inch TV, DVD player, and surround sound and expected me to help him selfishly. I overworked myself and started throwing up and even smashed a finger extremely bad. I did not receive even a thank you.

Today I learned that the new bunny I got, I'd have to give away. I pay my own bills, buy my own furniture and food. The bunny makes me so happy that it depresses me further to give it away. Its just a baby too.

I've poked around and found out my step mom doesn't want me to have a pet because she doesn't want to see me happy. She's been interested in buying an animal before for herself with strict guidelines that I can't be around it, so my dad said no. My dad wants a dog bad, but she keeps saying no because it's not hers and she can't make the rules.

I'm not suicidal right now but I wish my 6 month deadline would come faster. I'm sick of being abused physically, mentally, and verbally.

35,"We have been together for about 7 years now and within the past 2 years I've noticed he's been acting different. This all started when we became friends with this phone guy who caused a lot of problems for us. That guy hacked into my boyfriend’s email which gave him access to every single account he had. PlayStation, Xbox, student loans, eveeything
We were stalked. Ever since that he’s been really suspicious of people. We even moved two times to get away from that guy. I don’t know much about schizophrenia, but feel like this may have triggered some of it. His family does have a history of schizophrenia. This past year has been the roughest for us. My boyfriend swears that the neighbors are spying on him, every time a vehicle drives by he peeks out the window. He'll even step out of the house and flip everyone off, because he swears there spying on them. He believes these people have cloned my phone and they see everything that I do. He says the neighbors leave signals such as a car alarm, a dog barking, Etc. But the weird thing is that almost every time I turn my phone the neighbors dogs start barking. but that's what dogs do, they just bark. It's comes to the point where it's really stressful and draining. Every time he comes back from Walmart I asked him if he behaved. If anyone looks at him he'll tell them, ‘the rumors aren't true’, or he'll flip them off. I don’t know what to do. I’ve talked to him about this and he just gets really defensive and says that ‘these people’ are going to lie on the test and have him locked up. He’s even gone to the point where he got electrical tape and covered up every single nail hole in the walls because there could be cameras in the wall. I love him, I really do. But he needs to get help. He is very stubborn. I don’t know what to do.",26Jul2019,1

37,So I've been taking this medication for depression and anxiety. Before I took them I would just lose interest in all things and never laugh. I started taking the meds and I was laughing like I used to for 2-3 years then I went off the medication to test what it was like. All was good for another 2 years but the same thing happened again so I took the pills again. It worked for a bit but for a month now I just lost all interest and just want to sleep all the time (a hour before this post I contemplated suicide and that's what drove me to make this post) I just think its getting worse,26Jul2019,2
38,"dont know why but i kinda just want to wright. Last time that i wrote i felt some emotion so i guess thats why im writing. Basically i cant feel anything. For the past couple of days ive just been emotionally absent. I cant feel anything but a weird sort of muted terror that im just accepting. I dont know when it started but i think i know why. I cant feel any motivation. Its just not there. i dont even have enough motivation to lie still in my bed. All day today i felt like i wasnt myself, like i was putting on a mask, becoming someone different and just watching my life go by. I dont have friends. I want a friend so bad but i dont have one. Everybody in my life has someone they can be close to and i dont. Im just really good at pushing people away when im trying to hold on to them. And i still dont feel anything i have no desire to be accepted, i have no fear and no hope. No aspirations but no reason to resist letting myself float on the ocean of maddness all around me. Because im in a bubble. I think thats the best way i can describe what i feel. I feel like im just following the people i care for and admire, always trying to break out but i just cant. And sometimes i feel so invisible that i could just fade away and the world would go on without me. I hate that i love writing this because i think its the only thing that ive been able to engage in since the last time i wrote one of these. Ive ranked up to a blue belt but i dont feel proud, all i feel is everything im doing and every way i could do it better. I also got a saxophone and ive started teaching myself how to play i think im learning pretty fast and doing well. But i know that i only think that because im not good enough to notice what im doing wrong. Im a broken person. This is the only constant solid thing that i know. I want help and i want to be fixed but im too scared to hear that i cant be fixed. I want to go back to therapy but i dont think it would hekp me. And this isnt because of the abilities or lack there of, of any profesional its because im to scared too let out my emotions buti know i cant bottle it up either because one day i know im gonna pop and its gonna be real bad. My biggest fear right now is that when i end up snapping im just going to start hurting people. last time i blew up i tried to kill myself. I took a knife to my wrist and i tried to cut it, if the knife wasnt dull i wouldve bled put on my bedroom floor with my parents out in the hallway talking to me.I was only able to try one time and then i just broke down. I dont want to let people help me because im afraid they wont be able to. And if i cant get this sorted out before i go to college or graduate im done. The job marked is so fucked right now that ill be lucky if i can make enough to scrape by working 6 days a week. If i cant get myself straight before i graduate im going to be on my own. And then im going to have the social economic and educational stresses all at once. I want a solution that dosent involve the people around me knowing that ive been wearing a mask for basically my whole life and im scared that i might not like whats underneath that mask. I dont know who i am, what i want, where to go, what to do or why i should even bother. Because if i cant help anyone whats the point of doing anything. For the pride that i would feel alone in my bubble, or maybe as a feeble attempt to make progress somewhere. I wish i had felt something writing this but i didnt. I wrote all this down like i would take notes in a text book half assed splotchy inconsistent and hopping from idea to idea. I wonder why i dont feel sad anymore and i jusy cant figure it out maybe its like when you walk in a new room and you smell it at first but then it goes blank and you stop smelling anything.

41,"So I'm currently a 15 year old teenage boy who lives in Canada. When I was 8 I used to live somewhere else and I moved here with not family except my parents and sister. About a month after we moved to Canada two of my cousins moved here too and they lived with us. Eventually they moved out but tjen more cousins moved here (they are all over 20 and they moved here for college without they're parents). And so I've always lived in a house with at least 6 people including me in it. At one point I had 9 living in my house for at least 5 months. So with this many people in my house I never really got attention from my parents, and eventually I started making jokes and saying stupid things to get their attention. They didn't like that of course. They kept insulting me about my intelligence after the age of 10 because of that. And so I became very lonely in my house of 6 people because there was no one close to my age and my parents sort of verbally abused me(sort of) . I didn't have many close friends at school so I had no one to talk to. Don't get me wrong I had lots of friends, just no one close. I mainly just watched anime whenever I got sad because of how alone I felt. It would get worse because sometimes at school I would say things (just normal speaking) and I would get ignored. By the time I made it to 9th grade I actually had close-ish friends so I retired my anime phase. My life got generally better. I got more emotionally disconnected from my parents but I stopped caring about them and their opinions. I made friends in my neighbourhood that weren't from my school so I could always have someone to play with. In tenth grade I even got really close to a girl who I really like (or love? Idk) and so life was good. BUT then comes three weeks ago where I moved houses because my parents hated my old neighbourhood and my friends in it I guess. They moved far enough from my old house that my friends would never want to come over, but now I live closer to my school. I've been more or less alone for the past three weeks, because everyone in my house works till six and leaves at 7, and I try to ignore them. SO here's the bad part. The girl I liked (who is also the person I'm closed to, and I've never asked her out for that reason) lived close to my old house. Now I don't see her anymore and I feel like we're slowly growing further apart too. I've never told anyone about how alone I felt or how I get really sad out of no where sometimes. That's mainly because I tried to be serious and honest with my parents one time and they made fun of me for opening up to them (which I still I still don't understand how they did) . Now I'm very alone in a new neighbourhood and I've been crying myself to sleep for the past few days. I would talk to my friends about me feelings except a) I've always pretended to be the one in our group who's always happy and b) they all have their own problems and I don't want to be another one of the things they have to deal with while they have those. So I made this post at 2 am with a reddit account that I don't know how to use. I figure telling people on the internet is better than nothing. This way at least I'm recognizing that I need help even though I'm not getting any. I don't mind if no one reads this though because it's gotten really long :)",26Jul2019,2
42,"I have PTSD, OCD, agoraphobia and chronic depression.

I recently started experiencing what I would describe as mood swings. A bit of back story, I lost my disability, I had to get a job so I went back to work for Wal-Mart (a job I hated), I didn't have money for my meds so I was off of them for...I wanna say a week before my dad helped me out. I like my coworkers and I like zoning but everything else at the store is miserable. Its always sweltering in the store (especially when you're clocking in 12,000+ steps a day) so I am always dripping in sweat, my feet and my legs HURT (like I can barely walk at the end of my shift I am in such pain), they always give us freight to put out and I obsess over whether I'm getting it out fast enough or scanning it in right or if I estimated how much should go out, I haven't met my Boss Boss yet but I keep hearing how finicky he is and how he wants you to get everything done fast. I'm not good at being fast (and I always felt it shouldn't matter as long as you do it right) but I find myself worrying about if he'll like me or if he'll make this job even more of a living hell. Then theres the stress of money. I don't have money for food really, and after taxes my monthly take is only 1500 a month and my disability was 1800 a month. And all my bills, not including groceries, add up to 1500+ a month. And I'm stressing about it hard. 
Monday, coworkers and I were tasked with top stock which is where you take the stock on the top shelf and move it down to refill shelf stock. Near the end of my shift I had to give up trying to do the top stock bc the mixture of so many bright colors were making me anxious and climbing up and down, up and down was making me nauseous. I felt ashamed I didn't complete the task. 
Anyways, Tuesday I woke up with the strong sensation of wanting to cry. I resolved to take some time for self care later as I had Wednesday off. During my shift I'm tired, my head is pounding, my feet are throbbing, in the back there are carts and carts and pallets of Back to School freight, its never ending. And the bell for the fabric table keeps ringing (I have work in Fabrics and Crafts so I have to cut the fabric). 
Lunch rolls around and I resolve to treat myself to Burger King. I get a four dollar meal and sit down in the break room and suddenly as I'm eating...tears start flowing and I can't pinpoint any one reason, all I know is I can't stop crying no matter how hard I try. I stuff my food down my throat and exit the break room and go into the bathroom where I start full on sobbing.
During this I get in a fight with my therapist via text over money. The clock is ticking down and I can't pull myself together so I go to the personnel office and call a manager. Eventually two managers come in and talk to me, I tell them it wasn't anybody here who upset me (bc everyone has been nice and welcoming), I don't know what's wrong. I really don't, I don't know whats causing this outburst. They mercifully send me home, making sure that someone could drive me bc I clearly wasn't in a state to drive myself.
Anyways these past two days I've been off (I have been taking my meds since), I have sunk into deep depressive moments where I'm afraid to leave the couch or bed because I am afraid I will hurt myself(I have no plans to committ suicide, as far as I can tell this is OCD Harm working its way in) and I just feel so utterly hopeless. Then I can pull myself out of it for a bit and tell myself its all going to be okay. I don't know how extreme mood swings need to be for me to be concerned. Any thoughts on...any of this mess?",26Jul2019,2
44,"19(m). I tried searching reddit to see if anyone else has done what I’ve done and couldn’t find anything. My story is a big one and cause many problems along the way. I’ve had ADHD ever since I was a child but didn’t get diagnosed until I was 9. I lived in a house with my grandmother, mother, uncles and siblings. Life was fine. Money was never an issue. Everything was under control. I was 6 years old, my mother was a smoker so I always found lighters on the desk or went looking for them out of curiosity because fire was fascinating at that age. The curiosity sparked from me lighting pieces of paper on fire and blowing them out quickly. For some reason I found this rather fun and interesting at that age. One day, I was playing with the lighter, and I accidentally lit on fire fabric that was on a lamp. I tried to blow it out but I was out of luck because when I blew it the flame spreader almost instantly. Within seconds 
The entire room was on fire. (Also, I was sharing a room with my mother and brother and they were out running errands), quickly, I ran downstairs and told my uncle crying that the room was on fire. He didn’t believe me at first until I shook him hard and he saw smoke ash on my face. He ran upstairs quickly and saw. Tried throwing water in the room but quickly they all realized that we would have to evacuate and call the fire department. Me and my whole family watched the house burn in flames until they put the fire out. Ever since, the family has been separated and hasn’t been connected the same way they used to be. There’s communication problems and so many more issues that I feel responsible for, because if I hadn’t burn the house down, my family would probably be functional and love each other. I know I was only 6 but I get this constant feeling of disappointment whenever I see any of my family members., because I caused the biggest disaster they’ve ever seen. Until this day I hold my self responsible for the events that happened, even if I was so young, it’s something I have to take responsibility for. And the more I do that, the worse it comes. It’s like it will never go away .",26Jul2019,1

47," I had a very rough upbringing and I took it too heart, domestic abuse, was kidnapped from my mom and didnt see her for years, I was terrifed of my dad, legit had stockholm syndrome that I only now realize.

I was considered to be a gifted child (solving rubiks cube at 4) and yet I became so stupid in all aspect during my school till now (age 7-21).

I thought it was my ADD, finally now I realise its my Anxiety. I am 6 tablets in for Sertraline and I am completely different, I legit had an ego death, my persona is very vulnerable right now, because the world I experienced was through my filter of anxiety and I got so many things wrong (thus ego death). That was the only perspective I knew, because I had it ever since I remember (from childhood)).

My Anxiety held my mental capacity very far back, to the point I thought I couldnt visualise. I couldnt plan anything, I have failed countless time, I was very stupid. 6 days in, I am articulate, I dont want to go in detail but its night and day difference in terms of brain productivity.

My worry is schizo, I couldnt visualise before and I thought I had aphantasia, but now realising this, my visualisation is coming back as well, I dont want to get so shocked by my visualization and cause panic and build bad memories and become schizo, I feel like thats how people develop shizo. My visualisation is improving and u know, that is causing me slight anxiety rn.

I did a decent amount of edible weed before and had 5 pyschosis episode (once or twice very subtle voices but I did a lot of weed then, I hope its due to weed and anxiety and not a predictor for future illness)

I am at a point where my personality can become anything rn, its like a open vassle waiting to suck in all the information, and there would be layer added onto it till my personality fully develops (im guessing thats how personality develops). I dont want the foundation of my personality to be with terrifying stuff. 

Should I lay off the anxiety medication for now, it is 100% working and oh god i would not mind to be on this for the rest of my life, but im worried that i had a pyschosis like 1 day ago due to weed and I just want to take it slow? 

Should I talk to psychiatrist. Anyone being in a similar situation as me. Thanks, also sorry for messy layout, im slight panicking.",26Jul2019,1

Everything hurts and I do not know what nor who to tell that I have not tried to already.

My problem is I don't really normally think in English like that, if I mouth out or speak words I can think more complex thoughts, but they feel detached my true self, like I'll find myself making stuff up small lies and exaggerations and stuff like someone might do in a conversation. I dont really have inner thoughts saying ""you're not good enough to socialize"" or anything, but I feel nervous without any thought causing it. The only way I know that something makes me anxious (it's different for things like heights and stuff, those I can figure out just fine) is by just noticing a patern.

There’s still stuff on the floor but there’s way less than before. My desks are still messy though. I eat breakfast now, but I don’t eat much food at lunch or dinner. If I eat more than a small bowl of food I start to gag and feel sick, and I want to throw up.

I still feel empty. With friends, I feel less empty, same old same old. But now I fill the emptiness with cutting. Nothing big, nothing too deep. Small enough to hide under 4 hair bands on my wrist. A perfect lineup of cuts. Not deep enough to leave noticeable scars. I don’t need anybody to worry. Larger cuts on my ribs, where no one can see them. Deeper, larger, more likely to leave scars. Nobody cares if they can’t see it. 

I still think about suicide. What would happen, how easy it is to end your life. In everyday tasks thoughts pop up, saying that it would be easy to end it. Slit my wrists. Overdose. Jump off a skyscraper. Anything can be fatal. I won’t do it, not now, probably not later. I’m too scared. I want to live, but I don’t have a reason to.

I'm also finding a pattern from my mental health problems in early highschool compared to mental health problems now. This is definitely caused by external stuff. I think that I know how to manage things now. I'm also learning how to manage this shit with the ebb and flow of real, actual adult time because of shit kinda sucks sometimes.

Self care really does work. Having an outlet really makes a difference. I've started working out again and it mitigated the ruminating, which allowed me to think more clearly about the situation. Therapy is also helping me work on the stuff. I hope that I can pull things together and make the comeback I need. I just need to understand that things will be hard and that they aren't meant to be easy. From there, I get back to optimal functioning.

My mom being someone who wanted to communicate and talk everything out, and cause we lived with my dad's mother (ie, total hellscape for her emotions) her emotional needs weren't fulfilled. She started to depend on me for support and reassurance. I was a passive listener till I was about 18 and was just a shoulder for her to cry on. Then when I went away for college, I became a bit more active in helping her out. I used to tell her to take care of herself and tell her how to do that.
All this made something snap inside her and she started questioning what she was doing. This caused a rift in my parents' relationship. There was a huge communication gap between them. But I was someone who understood both of their ""language"". I was the mediator between them in maaany occasions throughout the last two years. Until a couple of months back when I couldn't take it anymore and quit being their marriage counselor. Since then, things have been a lot less stressful for me.
Now, the first time I felt something off about my relationship with my mom is when I watched Bates Motel. I felt that the situation there was a lot similar to mine but in a much dampened way and minus the psychopathy. But now, I feel like my relationship with my dad is approaching non-existent slowly and me having a relationship only with my mom.  Also, I tick a lot of boxes in the enmeshed relationship checklist.
My relationship with my friends also are kinda iffy. I have trouble with boundaries emotional and physical with them and it sometimes approaches borderline codependent.

Although my mom has never invaded my privacy or space, and has always been highly supportive of my decisions and choices, I feel our relationship might be enmeshed.

TL;DR.  My mom is emotionally depraved and have always turned to me for support till I reached a breaking point. It is also reflected in my other relationships. Although my privacy and space has never been violated, I think we have an enmeshed relationship.",26Jul2019,1

If any of you could spare 10 minutes on a survey that looks at intrusive thoughts, it'd be much appreciated.

Thanks Nick

\[ACADEMIC\] RESEARCH ON ATTITUDES TOWARDS INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS “REQUIRE ADULTS OVER 18YEARS OLD”

Intrusive    thoughts are unexpected and often unpleasant thoughts. They are    experienced as involuntary, and are sometimes intense, uncontrollable    and distressing. Intrusive thoughts can encompass any content that is    relevant to the person experiencing them, or the situation in which the    person may find themselves (e.g., doubting whether you have locked  your   car door).

Intrusive  thoughts  are  commonly experienced by the general population. They are  also a  feature  of psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD),  body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders and   hypochondriasis.  This study aims to examine people’s responses to   disclosure of intrusive  thoughts.

What will participation involve?

• This research involves participation in an approximately 10 to 15-minute online survey.

•    You will be asked to respond to demographic questions, and be   presented  with a short scenario describing the hypothetical disclosure   of  intrusive thoughts from someone (e.g., a friend). The scenario may    depict a mental health condition, such as those mentioned above. You    will then be invited to complete a short set of questions about your    perceptions of the hypothetical person who made the disclosure. You will    also be asked about your mental health knowledge and mental health    symptoms (including OCD, anxiety and depression), beliefs about    yourself, and your willingness to share distressing thoughts and    personal information with others.

What else do I need to know?

• In order to participate, you must be 18 years or above, and speak fluent English.

•    Some questions about sensitive topics will be asked in this study. If    you are uncomfortable with this, you may wish not to participate.

I don't know what will happen next, but the fact I got called back for an interview is the luckiest I can get. It's just a damn shame my tongue and mind won't cooperate. I couldn't justify or lengthen my answers because honest to God I just don't have anything to say other than I need this job and I'm trying to make a better life for myself. I'm truly sorry I cannot be normal or be a certain way. I spent some time looking like a normal person today but I guess you just can't disguise horrible personality.

Monday - Friday for some people can be what keeps them going, because they may have a job a routine, and if they have weekends off work, that can be SO daunting for them. If you are one of these people - you’ve got this! Stay grounded, anchor down and ride the waves, this is your fight, and you’re winning each round!♥️

For those who rely on weekends to keep you going - you’ve also got this! You’ve made it through yet ANOTHER week, and that must’ve been so tough going for you! You have two days now, be kind to yourself. Self care is not selfish, ok? Repeat after me: “SELFCARE IS NOT FUCKING SELFISH”, you do what’s best for you this weekend, be kind to yourself, because by god if anyone deserves it, it’s you!♥️

Struggle all week, despite what day it is? What the weather’s like, and just all round hate waking up every day? I’m so sorry, I’m sorry for ALL of you that have to fight the fight with your own mind, but you better believe it when I say, you’ve got this too!! Being mentally ill is fucking rough, and you DO NOT deserve to suffer, I promise you. For whatever reason, whether you’re aware of it or not, you’re fighting battles with your mind that not everyone will understand, and it’s tough going, it’s actually excruciating! But you know what? You keep going! Every. Single. Fucking. Day. And I know it’s exhausting, and there’s so many time’s that you just want to stop and give up - feel no shame in feeling that, or admitting that! There’s NO SHAME AT ALL! Try and reach out to someone you trust, believe it or not, Twitter has an AMAZING mental health community with so many people who want to help and listen, reach out on there, all of you, NO ONE deserves to suffer on their own!

So backstory. my parents are divorced and I live with my mom. I wasn't particularly young when they split but I don't remember anything about it. I barely remember him at all, and I was in school. Mom only talks bad about him, but she isn't any better. 

Sometimes I black out. Not *too* often, but it lasts for a while. Sometimes a few *days* pass and I have no idea what happened. I just feel like I'm drifting away from my own body without knowing it.

70,"I don't have any life changing advice, just wanted to share a small anecdote from more than a decade ago that I still think about. It was such a small, unimportant interaction, but I often think back to it for perspective.

I was shopping for my brother's birthday on a slow day at the mall. I decided cologne was a decent option, so walked into a Dillard's or JcPenny and browsed their options. Not knowing much about cologne, when the clerk was nearby I had asked for help in choosing. I was in a particularly good mood for some reason, otherwise I probably would've avoided interacting with anyone.

She seemed highly bothered I asked for help. I was younger twenties but still looked like a teen, maybe she thought I was a waste of time. I said I was looking for ideas for my brother, and she somewhat condescendingly asked ""OK well what does he wear?"". I said I didn't know, and wasn't even sure if he had worn any in the past and laughed. Just trying to be friendly. She didn't find it amusing and said ""Well how am I supposed to help you find one then?"". I was caught off guard that an associate would be so rude about simple questions. I stayed polite, and tried to continue saying ""Well maybe I can just get him a popular one? "". She didn't respond and walked away.

It really upset me. She was so cold and mean when I was having such a good day before. I asked myself ""Why am I so unlikeable? Why couldn't I have researched even a little about colognes?"" I was beating myself up for such a small thing that made no sense to be self critical about (you should've heard my self talk when self criticism was actually justified).

The little confidence I had that day was shaken. I just wanted to go home and not talk to anyone for a few decades at that time.

I was walking out, and the lady that had ""helped"" me was doing something close to the exit. I really didn't want to chance interacting with her again but kept going... as it was the exit. I thought she was glaring at me as I was leaving. Normally I wouldn't make eye contact, but for some reason I did. 

She wasn't glaring at me, she was crying. Not bawling, but the look of exhaustion of something weighing on her heavy. As I walked out, the simple words she said are what stuck with me. She said in such a quiet, defeated voice ""Thanks for being nice""

I don't know why this has always stuck with me. I'm 32 now and still think of this interaction often. The lesson I learned from it, was I was about to let this lady's relatively cruel words destroy my day, or maybe even week or month. I was being self abusive reacting to what she had said, believing that I was dumb and not worthy of anyone's time based on it. I would have left thinking I was an idiot unless she said that.

We believe the reality we created in our head. If someone says ""You are useless"" you believe you are useless. If they say ""You're an idiot"" you believe you are an idiot. If you're like me, for every dozen compliments I get, someone might say one negative thing and I can guarantee the negative is the only thing I will remember unless I become self aware of how unfair and untrue that is to myself.

I'm not sure what the moral is. Maybe it is the time old ""Don't let another person's bad day make yours the same"" or some variation of that. I think it is more along the lines of a quote from Plato I've always loved.

""Be kind, for everyone is fighting their own battle"". Be kind to others, and more importantly, be kind to yourself.

71,"I’ve realized that my girlfriend and I don’t have a future together, not because I don’t like her, or don’t care about her, but because I’ve started to see things in her that I know won’t change that I can’t live with. I still love her very much, which is why this is so difficult. She has suicidal depression and right now she’s in the middle of a medication change and it’s been less than a week since she last told me she was going to kill herself, and of course as usual I am the only one who was there to stop her from doing it. I feel like I am responsible for her life, because I’ve singlehandedly stopped her from dying multiple times. I keep her safe until she feels better, and then we move on with our lives. I don’t mind dating her, but we’ve talked about our future and marriage and all that and we both planned on being together forever, and recently I’ve started to see aspects of her that maybe I ignored or hoped I could change about her and I realize my mistake was assuming I can change her. You can ask someone to change their behavior, but you can never make someone change themselves. She’s very close to being someone I could spend forever with, but I can’t because of some major differences in beliefs that would ultimately just cause argument after argument if we kept dating or got married. We’ve been dating for a little over a year now, so I know it’s probably dumb for us to have made forever plans after such a small time together, but I think it has to end and I don’t know how I’m going to live with myself if she kills herself after I break up with her. She wouldn’t be alive without me and I’m very much afraid that she won’t stay alive without me, I’m her everything, and I don’t think she sees the same problems as I do, I mean obviously she sees them but I think she still kind of assumes that I’ll change, but I know I won’t, and I no longer expect her to.

72,"I started taking SSRIs (Sertraline/Zoloft) for my depression for the 1st time a couple of years ago, and am still on them.

Since being on medication I stopped hearing voices in my head (3 of them) and it's been generally pretty great. I've reduced my medication, but when I try to get off it, my mood swings return, and after a while so do the voices.

I can't find anything relating SSRIs to any form of psychosis (except a paper saying they are more effective at treating non-psychotic depression, but that doesn't mention anything about the hallucinations).

I also feel a limited range of emotions: I fail to remember the last time I felt distinctly sad in years; the same goes for happiness. I take no true joy in anything. I do, however, feel emotions such as anger and boredom. 

I tend to stay inside a lot as I prefer not to interact socially, although nine times out of ten I will attend if friends ask me to meet up (e.g. for a sleepover or trip to cinema). 

I don't really feel a connection to my family or friends and wouldn't mind never speaking to any of them again, not due to mistreatment from them but simply due to how I am.

I can identify depression so I'm pretty sure I'll go get help when I need it but here's what I'm struggling with - I'm still in love with someone who broke up with me 2 years ago. We have never cut contact and met pretty often after the break up too. He sort of knows about my feelings but is in denial so he doesn't feel guilty about breaking up with me. He thinks if it weren't for him, I would be in a relationship right now and I deserve to be happy but I'm not (he says). Through it all, he has been a good friend to me.

And now he is here too. Same university, same course. Its making me unhappy every minute of every day of my new life thinking about him being here and the worst case scenarios over the next 2 years.

79,"I've always felt like I was missing a lot of memories from my childhood, and my twin says the same thing. We were talking about it one time, and she said that one time she had a flashback that made her think that she might have repressed memories. And she said she thought it might have been sexual abuse. And every time I've heard anything about sexual abuse, I understand, and I relate to it, which I think is really strange because that never happened to me.

So last night I got high. And I've only ever smoked a couple times, and I just wanted to get really high to see what would happen. 

And then me being me I over did it and ended up over the toilet gagging. 

And then I walked back out there and after a while I kind of zoned out and suddenly there was this giant circle filled with triangles and then it shattered in front of me. 

And I had brought a blanket out in the living room with me, so I grabbed it and then I just got the most awful feeling. And I looked at my friend, and said I didn't like the blanket. And then I threw it across the room, and asked her to throw it away, and then I looked at it, and said I was going to burn it. And I don't know why 

But all the sudden it was like I remembered every single thing that I had forgotten about my childhood, and I was just staring at the blanket in horror, and I started crying. Because what I remember I'm pretty sure was sexual abuse that happened to me when I was a kid. I'm 19 now so I guess I'm not that old.

And it was like everything I looked at and thought about just brought me right back and it was like this endless slideshow that wouldn't stop. And it was the most awful thing and I just couldn't stand any physical sensation because it would remind me of stuff 

I'm afraid that I'm going crazy and it didn't happen. All those ""memories"" are not that clear, but in the moment I knew exactly what they meant. And I was high. And I don't think the person who did those things could actually do that, because it's just such a horrible thing to do and I don't think they could have. I'm probably just imagining it all.

We spoke about it after having a frank conversation about my SH/SI and how he suspects I might have bpd but isn't qualified to diagnose anything. We operate under the assumption that I have been diagnosed with social anxiety because its blatantly and painfully obvious.

Now to my question, how do you differentiate between not having sufficient help (having just a talk therapist  rather than psychotherapist, dbt-focused therapist, ect) or just sabotaging ones recovery? It feels like there's two distinct voices in my head that are both mine that wont stop fighting about whether I'm doing this for attention or if I'm just too ashamed to ask for help because my mom taught me that I wasnt worthy of help. 

I think the program would do me some good, but I'm worried I will lose out on a weeks pay if I do the program (its 9a-3p for 5 to 7 days) or lose all my PTO and not have any for next year.

My directions were to start off on a quarter a tablet once in the mornings for a week, then half a tablet for two weeks, then an entire tablet a day until finished. I am currently on my third day of taking full tablets. This was done as to minimise any negative affects of putting me on a full dose immediately as much as possible.

I didn’t exactly have a conversation with my therapist and psychiatrist about what to expect and side effects (I really should’ve!) but I have a slight understanding that antidepressants can often make you feel worse before you get better.

Recently I’ve felt generally “worse”,  increasingly short fused, ill tempered and quite withdrawn.  I haven’t been able to hold my tongue when I get annoyed and have been quiet emotional. (I wondered if it was PMS, but I had no physical symptoms of PMS with those, and my pms symptoms last only for about a week or a couple days)  I’d describe my health as somewhat declining but I’m not sure how much of it has to do with starting fluoxetine/taking bigger doses or it’s a seperate issue of mine.

the question here is how i'd go about getting him forcibly moved into a treatment center

Which, I'm an introvert and I prefer the spotlight to be off of me entirely but I am a very intelligent and driven woman. A perceived threat, I'm sure. She also began to quickly inform me, daily, of each time she got hit-on, cat-called and she began to way overshare about her sexual history.

Now, 3.5 years later. She is absolutely insufferable. She constantly has affairs. She constantly creates drama and draws attention to herself. If I begin a new fitness program-- BOOM suddenly she begins a new fitness program and talks about it OBESESSIVELY. Everything is a one-upper. Everything is about HER. I'm so sick of it but she is so engulfed in herself that I get away with murder at this job. I run my side business while I work here. She pays zero attention to what I do and does not delegate anything to me because she needs all the accolades. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? I feel so isolated because no one else has known her as long as me and has been as close to her as I have. I want to tell the world who and what she really is, but that wouldn't solve anything.

97,"This is a throwaway account as I didn't want to post this on my actual one.

First off, I'm not comfortable sharing my age but I'm still in school. 

My parents divorced when I was young, and have lived separately since. This never really effected me emotionally as I was very young when it happened.

A few years ago I was 'diagnosed' with a severe form of Social Anxiety and took 6 weeks of councelling for it. I've always been pretty open about my mental health with other people - up until the start of 2019 - the start of my hell.

Me, my brother and my mum had to move in with her mum (my grandmother) and for a while I didn't even have my own room, I had to sleep in a bed in the corner of my grandmothers room. Ever since we moved in I've been struggling, on a downward spiral. I think I'm depressed, and my social anxiety has gotten a hell of a lot worse. 

When I did finally get my own room after my cousin moved out (his parents live in a foreign country - Abu Dhabi or somewhere like that) nothing changed. I actually felt worse. No motivation, no nothing. Just this overwhelming feeling of worthlessness.

However, the worst part was yet to come. I didn't mention it but just after Christmas time my parents had some big argument about child care and money and ended up hating eatch other. My mum even tried to stop me from seeing my dad more, who I have a very good relationship with. Well, thinks sort of got better in that regard - again, for while. Then my dad unfortunately got diagnosed with depression and he was just so defeated it hurt so much to see. 

I think maybe this is what really did it for me. Because the worst thing happened. I developed a really strong self-hatred. I couldn't stand looking in the mirror. Constantly insulting myself, calling myself a failure, overweight, ugly. All these coming from myself. It's the worst feeling ever - and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. 

I'm almost certain I'm depressed - but I have no idea what to do. I can't talk to my dad because I don't want it to seem like I'm being an attention-seeker, and I don't want to worsen his either. I can't talk to my mum because our relationship is... strange. And I don't think she'll listen. I really need help. For the first time ever in my life - I just can't see a way out.",26Jul2019,1

Every relationship I have is the same, i give her all the attention and I make her feel happy and wanted. Nothing ever gets reciprocated. Nobody ever asks how I feel, it's like people just want me to make them laugh and nobody wants to understand my emotions. People use to make jokes that I was depressed because I would never smile or be happy with anything. I would join in on that joke, but I feel like I am all alone with my thoughts.

So a bit of context, I suffer from anxiety with some depressive symptoms, and have had a burnout about a year ago. I have gone through therapy and found a new job and everything is going better now, even though I am still fragile emotionally and mentally.

She doesn't want me to help her at work, she just needs to vent and feel that I'm there for her, but it's feeling more and more like a burden to me, at the point where I've spent the last two hours thinking about breaking up.

So, basically, a friend of mine has depression and many other things, which I couldn't list exactly, but I know there's a *sh\*tlot* of things going on.

My main problem is that I don't really know what to do/how to act : logically I can't really act like I do with everybody  (or can I ? What I mean is that I'm less speaking about the very fat/dank/extreme jokes, and more about serious/intelligent/attentive things.)

I've read somewhere that it is good to ask poeple with mental illnesses to do things, like going for a walk, etc. I don't know if it really helps, but I've tried once or twice and I got ""denied"".

Furthermore, since we don't see each other anymore, we talk by text messages only. This is another problem for me, because I'm trying to be nice and bring conversations themes, but 9 times out of 10 I am the one who begins the discussion. Sometimes I'm left on read, sometimes I don't receive any answer for days. This is pretty much why I kinda stopped beginning new talks a few weeks ago : I don't wanna be too much ""oppressant/annoying"" (I don't really have a word for that), and it prevents me from feeling troubled.

Troubled, because when I'm not getting any sign for hours/days, a part of me is concerned because maybe something bad happened, but the biggest part of me feels weird, thinking that maybe I am *that* annoying and that I actually need to stop texting this person. This get weirder, because when we have a chat, the atmosphere is good. At least seems good, and I start doubting about it : is this person faking the good friendship, and it's actually annoying ? If I'm not annoying, then why do I get such little answers ?

112,"For the past 5 years my wife and I have been paying off extremely poor loans we took out in an emergency for the sake of getting custody of my daughter whom requires extra attention for physical needs she was born with. To sum this up, it was either take out these loans and get custody or worry constantly that my daughter would be harmed by her biological mother as another child was whom had CP (and was almost killed. Yeah welcome to Ohio where a mom can do no wrong and even with that a court won’t just give you your kid)

So we get the loans after having exhausted all credit cards we own, maxed to the limits. This starts 5 of the hardest years financially I have ever lived through. We lose about upwards of $1000 our income every month.  On months when we get more than 2 paychecks...we lose more! We are not applicable for any assistance thanks to agencies not recognizing loans as any kind of monthly expense so we have pretty much mostly struggled on our own and will have to for at least another year an a half.

As this period of our life grows closer and closer to being over, money back in our pockets, the ability to buy a “forever” house to live in I find myself hitting more and more walls each day. I deal with untreated bipolar disorder as well as PTSD as diagnosed by a medical professional. Thanks to the coat of medications and treatments I cannot afford to have these things. I cannot afford to sit in therapy once a week to try and talk past having been molested multiple times in my early childhood, talk about how not having a dad since 4 had fucked me up cause I don’t know how to act with my own children at times, talk about how some days life is so hard I wanna jump off a bridge on my way home and hope that I don’t change my mind half way down the drop. 

My wife is an excellent support system in all honestly. While I might not share 90% of what’s going on in my brain in an effort to remain tough and strong for her and the kids, ending every night in her embrace and starting every morning with a look at her beautiful face really keeps me going. Walking to the living room to see my two children whom I love dearly and would give the world for keeps me hanging on. This family is the glue that holds me like a bungee cord when I wanna take that leap off the tallest mountain just so the pain and the hardship ends.

As of recent though I’m not sure how much more I can take. As I approach 30 it’s like everything is catching up to me, reality setting in. They won’t always be there. I won’t always be here. All I want is to make it this next year and a half without having a mental breakdown that lands me in a looney bin because if things get any harder, I don’t think I’m gonna make it.

I can’t not make it more clear that I am not suicidal.

The last one I visited said nothing. Some here suggested me to try stugeron so I took it yesterday but it did nothing for me. I don't know what to do. It is unbearable condition. My life is terrible. I don't play guitar anymore, I don't read books... I'm so desperate.

My general health is good but I'm quite overweight. Can being overweight cause such condition? My BMI is 33.6

I+m so desperate that I consider a suicide. It impossible to live with this pressure. I don't have a wife or children so its not a big deal.",26Jul2019,1

120,"  After YEARS of biting my nails to the point of bleeding i finally just... stopped. I remember just being fed up with always hiding them that i decided something needed to be done, so i got out my Moms nail stuff box and painted them, ever since then i haven’t even felt compelled to bite.
   I think the main factor that helped was one of my friends kept one-upping me every time i tried to talk to her about how much i hated biting my nails. It would get so annoying how she would say stuff like “Well Ive been biting my nails more frequently” and “Mine look worse than yours” as if it was a competition. Anytime i even mentioned the word “nails” she would have to talk about how bad hers were, though they weren’t that bad just looked like she chipped all her nails but she had to let everyone know how bad they are. But now i can rub in her face how beautiful mine are :P

121,"I have a very close friend that I have know for about 9 years. She can be a very toxic friend but I think of her like an older sister and when push comes to shove, she has always been there. When I first met her she had a baby daughter that was a few months old. I was a bit younger and childless and kind of became friends with the family as their babysitter first but realized we had a lot in common and became great friends. After college, my lifelong anxiety began to decline and I started struggling more with depression. This was about 4 years into our friendship. During those previous 4 years though I spent a TON of time with her and her daughter. We probably saw each other at minimum once a day. We were very codependent (in a very unhealthy way). I love her daughter like a niece, she was and is still a great kid and we have a really close bond. However once I graduated college and started working full time, I had less free time to hang out with them but we still saw each other a lot. My mental health continued to decline, her daughter started school, my friend had a son. Lots of normal life changes and we had some rough patches but always made up, quite honestly because of how close her daughter and I were (my friend is an only child and her husbands family doesn’t live local so I’m really the only local “family”). Last year the anxiety became more panic and morphed into agoraphobia which also caused my depression to increase. I can leave my house but everything is just 100 times harder than it used to be. Travel overnight is pretty much out of the question unless absolutely mandatory (one time for work in the last two years). Prior to all this my friend, her daughter, &amp; I would frequently go on little girls trips together. They were fun and I have great memories. But the agoraphobia makes it challenging today. Finally to my am I the asshole story...my friend knows my circumstances, her daughter is 9 so obviously does not as she wouldn’t understand. Her daughter does notice and comments that I’m not around as much. My friend frequently makes me feel pretty guilty for not spending time with her daughter, sometimes intentionally but other times I think she is just trying to tell me they miss hanging out, I still feel guilty though. Apparently the other day her daughter asked if we could take a girls trip since she misses doing so &amp; we haven’t done that since my friend had her son who is 2. She told her daughter that travel makes me nervous and that I’m not able to travel but that we could talk about it. She told me this to me after as an FYI in case her daughter brought it up. I still don’t have kids myself but I feel like there were a lot better things she could have told her daughter instead of throwing me under the bus and exposing my personal struggles with a 9 yo child. I know for a fact she does not tell her husband about my issues so coming up with some kind of excuse would not have been difficult. I never asked her to keep my issues to herself but I’m just really shocked and hurt by her ignorance. I’m obviously struggling and throwing it in my face and making me feel more guilty than I already do isn’t helpful. I’ve been maintaining my distance the last few days. Am I an asshole? Or even just over sensitive? Or did she cross a line?",26Jul2019,1

I also see that people sometimes say that it's not always to win. I WANT to believe that, BUT MY BRAIN NEVER WANTS TO LOSE!!!

123,"So for the past year I have been playing video games competitively. Waking up at 11am eating/going to school and then getting on at 7pm until around 4 am (10 hours). I have put a lot of stress on myself to practice every day and I have even been blocking out my family/friends to make more time. Yesterday I broke down after dying a couple games in a row. I realized that I wasn’t having fun at all anymore playing video games. The scariest part is that I can’t enjoy anything that used to make me happy. I came to the conclusion that I have been desensitized to dopamine due to excessive hours on the computer. The reason I came back everyday wasn’t to play a game I loved, it was just so that I can function properly. I have decided to take a couple week break from my computer and reduce time that I spend on my phone. My question is: what is the fastest way to gain my sensitivity for dopamine back so that I can enjoy normal things again? Is it better to release as little dopamine as possible throughout the day or release a little bit doing normal things like sports or exercise?",26Jul2019,1

130,"What a week, amiright? Trump tweeting at 6am (unnecessary things as well), Mueller testimony, typical oppression, new baby Trump as Britains PM amongst many other things. Since I am balancing work life, social life, and other avenues in my life it is difficult to discuss all topics during the week. With that being said I usually am very opinionated so when I see new stories developing I usually have an idea of what I want to talk about, but this week no stories resulted in my blood boiling. So let’s talk about probably the biggest testimony that I have listened to in recent times; Robert Mueller.

Now for those of you have read the report I salut you, and for those of you that haven’t, do better. The big day came and passed on Wednesday after months of political war (Barr, Republicans in general, Trump etc.) and more than 100 days after the release of his report detailing heinous acts and more specifically provided us with further insights about Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, Robert Mueller took questions from Capitol Hill lawmakers for several hours on that day. Before I continue, for those of you that didn’t tune in, Mueller was subject to only answering what was in the report due to Executive Privilege on the majority of topics outside of the report.

My first reaction to the proceedings was the fact that the Republicans weren’t actually attempting to establish crimes against Trump but were out to make Mueller look like a villain and questioned him, not the facts of the report. Before we continue I would like to applaud the politicians who did their duty and demonstrated to the world the corruption within the Trump organization. Here are some of my takeaways for the day;

1. Mueller disappointed the republicans and eliminated their main line of questioning — *he did this by stating, in his opening statement, that he would be unable to address anything related to the “Steele dossier” document. This resulted in the elimination of a major line of questioning for the Republicans. The reason this was major is because Trump has been insistent that the entire investigation was illegal because it was based on this document, that was partially funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee*
2. He also in the same statement disappointed the Democrats (LOL) — *in the same statement Mueller made it very clear that he would not address any questions involving Attorney General William Barr or the actions of Congress. The Democrats very much wanted to explore differences in public statements about the special counsel investigation*
3. Mueller directly contradicted Trump on FBI Job — *again one of trumps tweets stated on Wednesday morning, “it has been reported that Robert Mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of FBI Director (and get turned down) the day before he was wrongfully appointed Special Counsel. Hope he doesn’t say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the interview, including the Vice President of the United States!” (this man has raised my blood pressure several levels) In a unique turn of events, Mueller directly contradicted Trump’s version of events. In response to Gohmert stating that he met with Trump the day before he was appointed as special counsel as a job interview for the open FBI spot. Mueller stated “not as a candidate,” for the job.*
4. Mueller didn’t consider indicting Trump on obstruction because of Justice guidelines — *The reason he did not even consider indicting the President on obstruction charges was because of guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel that a sitting President cannot be indicted. However as Mueller stated “we did not reach a determination as to whether the President committed a crime.” Guess we will see what that means*
5. Mueller confirmed (reconfirmed?) lots of details Trump doesn’t acknowledge or state — *The first critical detail that was illustrated (verbally, since people don’t like to read) was that Russia interfered in the election to help Trump hurt Hillary Clinton. Are you surprised that Trump and McConnell are blocking funding to increase cyber security? It was also mentioned that the Trump campaign were actually thrilled about the help and welcomed it to help him with and this detail also correlated with the fact that Trump was/is involved in business dealings in Russia. Which, all-in-all, is very bade new for the President and his past denials.*

Now those were my big takeaways from the testimony but real quick lets recap;

* Mueller’s investigation did not exonerate President Donald Trump
* Russian interference was not a hoax and the investigation was not a witch hunt
* Russia interfered in the election in a sweeping and systematic fashion
* Russia worked to benefit Trump as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election
* Trump developed messaging strategies around the release of stolen emails
* Trump lied and directed other to lie to hide those facts

Overall, America you have a crook as a president. Mueller even stated that he could charge Trump with Obstruction after his term is done this immensely worrisome that America knows this and yet he still has a terrifying amount of power in the world. Trump also controls nukes, so ya a little worried.

So I don't really know what to do here tbh I just have a spare account and need advice.

So just out of hs college student living at home with my family have been diagnosed with asperger's a few years ago went through some depressive and suicidal stages(times? Idk) when I was younger a bit of self harm here and there no one know about that, I have been doing much better lately the thoughts and feelings have faded but there was always something else I had anger problems for years but over time I got control over myself and settled far better than I ever thought I would.  During the times I would feel like that I would feel angry and not just normal anger more like a horrid rage I could never shake off I started having thoughts about hurting people anyone at first but through the years it's become more directed at friends and family, I would push people away because that feeling scared me I don't like the idea of hurting anyone but in a way I do part of me wants that for years I had thoughts about how easy it would be to kill my family in their sleep they have been a constant over the years.

Over the years my mother and I have had a rocky relationship never seeing eye to eye on things arguing all the time, I always feel like my opinion just doesn't matter to her and over the years I think a hate for her has been building but I don't know why it feels so strong she has her moments where we get into arguments but she has been supportive of me aswell. A lot has went on lately in the family so we have ended up with another family members children staying with us for probably a long time I am 100% fine with that it's causing my mother some stress and while we don't see eye to eye I can say I still love her and care about her health.

A few days ago my brother and her got into an argument and she doesn't want to see him again I can see why.

We got into a pretty bad argument today that lead to a pretty bad screaming match and I don't know what to do   I have been having incredibly vivid thoughts about hurting her I don't want to but they won't go away I just want to leave make sure everyone is safe from me. I don't know what to do right now just sitting in the dark typing this.

I don't think I was right in the argument I should have just kept myouth shut.",26Jul2019,1
133,"I've always felt like I was missing a lot of memories from my childhood, and my twin says the same thing. We were talking about it one time, and she said that one time she had a flashback that made her think that she might have repressed memories. And she said she thought it might have been sexual abuse. And every time I've heard anything about sexual abuse, I understand, and I relate to it, which I think is really strange because that never happened to me.

So last night I got high. And I've only ever smoked a couple times, and I just wanted to get really high to see what would happen.

And then me being me I over did it and ended up over the toilet gagging.

And then I walked back out there and after a while I kind of zoned out and suddenly there was this giant circle filled with triangles and then it shattered in front of me.

And I had brought a blanket out in the living room with me, so I grabbed it and then I just got the most awful feeling. And I looked at my friend, and said I didn't like the blanket. And then I threw it across the room, and asked her to throw it away, and then I looked at it, and said I was going to burn it. And I don't know why

But all the sudden it was like I remembered every single thing that I had forgotten about my childhood, and I was just staring at the blanket in horror, and I started crying. Because what I remember I'm pretty sure was sexual abuse that happened to me when I was a kid. I'm 19 now so I guess I'm not that old.

And it was like everything I looked at and thought about just brought me right back and it was like this endless slideshow that wouldn't stop. And it was the most awful thing and I just couldn't stand any physical sensation because it would remind me of stuff

I'm afraid that I'm going crazy and it didn't happen. All those ""memories"" are not that clear, but in the moment I knew exactly what they meant. And I was high. And I don't think the person who did those things could actually do that, because it's just such a horrible thing to do and I don't think they could have. I'm probably just imagining it all. And I really need to talk to someone about this, but I'm afraid it isn't real

I felt a few months ago a sort or creaking or clicking in the back or my skull when I wasn’t doing anything. Not like a bone of some sort cracking but like something small and alive was at the base of my skull moving around. I thought I was going crazy and I still think I am. It happens once a week or every other if I’m lucky. 

I know I sound crazy but...I was and am pretty sure a bug is fucking living in my skull. It clicks and moves and walks and sleeps. I think I’m mad but now I sit and feel these strange and tiny ticks- like I feel like mosquitoes are going up my nose and I swallow them by accident but now I’m starting to think the bug laid eggs and they are trying to escape threw my nose but fail and I end up swallowing them. 

Every time I try to tell someone they think I’m fucking kidding but this shit is actually fucking me up. I can’t sleep lately cause every second I feel bugs crawling on me. Im disgusted by the thought of a bug touching me. They are disposable and don’t deserve to live. 

If it means anything for the past couple of months, a few after it initially started my writing, train of thought, and speech has all declined. I have ADD and love to write but now it’s almost like I’m dyslexic- the things I find myself mixing up like d and b, m and n, g and q, d and q, b and q it’s annoying. 

The worst part is sleep...Mainly the lack there of. 
I can’t sleep and when I do it’s cause I’ve been so sleep deprived my body forces me to. When I try to lay in bed a constantly slap my body and scratch by self I feel bugs all over me. I use to be able to sleep for half the day, it’s slowly and slowly gotten less and less and now around 3-5 hours instead of the 10 that people in my age range are recommended. 

I fear for my psyche...I fear I may be schizophrenic but I don’t hallucinate anything. And mentally ill people aren’t self aware. 

TL;DR :

17 yr old male.

But i get episodes once every 2 weeks or so of extreme uncontrollable anger. Usually starts when a minor inconvenience happens or a change of plans. I lose my fucking shit.

I become a totally different human being. First of all, suicidal, dark dark thoughts. I begin “clenching” my whole body and vibrating til my head hurts. I sob uncontrollably for no darn reason. Just cry for everything that has ever happened to me. I bite myself really hard all over my legs and arms and i hit my head on the floor til it bruises. 

When im in an episode i lack empathy. I curse at my siblings , i curse at everyone. I scream. 

I also lack self control when im in that state, if someone were to talk to me i would just hit. Hard. 

I punch walls and scrape the skin of my thighs.

I hit my phone on the floor so many times that its screen shattered. Recently i blocked all my friends on social media then unblocked them after the episode was gone. 

I screamed to my parents face “i hate you” repeatedly and it still weighs on my mind.

One of these episodes lasts about 15-30 mins. After im done and ive taken deep breaths i come back to my senses and go like “wtf...?”

My usual self is normal, happy at times. I am not depressed or anything. I do get episodes of moderate depression but these are usually just a feeling of emptiness and last about a week. 

Although i am an easily annoyed person, not every annoyance turns into one of these episodes, just a few. Sometimes id go months without one, sometimes twice a day.

My anger started when i hit puberty but this only started like last year. Idk what it is, idk what to do about it.",26Jul2019,2
149,"(Sorry for the stream of consciousness) I’ve (25f) been in a stagnant and nearly constant state of depression for months. It’s been on and off for years, so this is nothing new. I’m so good at hiding it, my friends never, ever know unless I want them to. Sometimes I suddenly I go completely off the radar (because I’m just sooo busy) and they suspect something. 

But these past two months have been the worst. I am currently unemployed because I quit my job to go abroad to SE Asia to get certified as a yoga instructor. It’s been impossible for me to find work doing my dream job since I’ve been back due to the local market being completely saturated with yoga instructors. But finally. Finally:

There’s a job on the horizon (not yoga but it’s something). And I started doing tiny things to get out of this hole. I try to make sure to compliment and show gratitude to my amazing partner. I’m staying in and making a home cooked dinner every night. I’m playing with my dog more, I started forcing myself to smile at my reflection in the mirror. I started running and cycling again this week. I go a little further each day. And each day I add a little something new to my toolbox of happiness. Today I wore some berry colored lip stain, just to do something a bit different. 

I don’t know if this is a phase but trust me on this: while this taste of happiness is in my heart, I’m telling myself that I *deserve* this. I’m grateful for this tiny break because depression is exhausting and I think I need a breather. 

It’s possible. You just have to believe it for yourself.",26Jul2019,2
150,"I know it depends on the type of depression, and other factors. But still.
Also, how much do you pay for them?
Just trying to figure out if I can afford to get help....",26Jul2019,3
151,"Can I say that I am badly grateful if I don't really feel it?  I say my parents have taught me to always say thank you, but for example if someone helps me I only say thank you and I do not feel gratitude with anyone or my own parents when they feed me or anything in general I only say ""thank you""  but I don't really feel gratitude to anyone.  so I go around that a lot and I don't know what conclusion to reach and how to change that way of thinking or of being or what I know.",26Jul2019,2
153,"Right, so I visited a doctor a few weeks ago about my current mental state, and he basically gave me the rundown of future steps and options for me. One thing he did do was write down a few numbers/emails and told me to contact one of them and try out their counselling/youth services. Thing is, I have no clue how to do this or what to write (because I'm going to do it via email) to actually refer myself to them, so these notes he wrote me have just been sitting in my wallet these past few weeks. I know I have to contact them, because I guarantee that if I don't this will get much worse and already has over just these few weeks, but I have no clue what to say, how to say it and it's all just very anxiety inducing. I also haven't told anyone about the doctor appointment beyond two close friends and even then I haven't said much beyond the detail of the fact that it was on a Thursday and I have a number to call. I just don't want people stepping on eggshells around me or look at me differently if I let them know how much my brain dislikes me, I'm kind of the 'it's not great, but it'll be fine' guy as far as I want them to know. So this makes it harder because I usually have someone help me draft stuff before I send it and I cant do that now because no-one really knows what its about. 

I really just don't know what's going on in my head and I need help figuring it out, but so far I'm just lost and I really don't like this at all. It's just so tiring and I need to figure this out else I'm not going to get very far. Any guidance would be appreciated.",26Jul2019,1
154,"So, I realize that I have a thing going on.

I have a history of being a generally anxious person. I used to be very be very concerned that if I drink alcohol I would become an alcoholic. Over time, I grew to be an easily social, bold, ballsy, confident, and happy person. Skittish, yes, but everything was cool and awesome and I just did whatever I give a shit about. One night out with friends, I got particularly emboldened to get drunk. I personally bought myself a small container of vodka. I woke next morning like nothing happened and tried to move on. But there was this persistent idea that something was missing. Over the next few months, I struggled with rumination, depersonalization, cloudy memories, derealization and a bunch of other stuff. I thought I had PTSD or something from a scary event in a car. Then I realized that I had nothing to do with the car. I've been in just as scary situations.

I then thought back today after talking with a therapist. I'm not an alcoholic. So what's the problem? Why do I still give a shit? What the fuck is going on? And then I sort of realized the answer. Being an alcoholic was the only real things I was anxious about besides things that were inherently in my control. And I previously have been able to show off what people described as an exceptional ability to cope. But now I can't. What's the problem? I realize that there is no problem. So why can't I stop worrying about problems that aren't there?

I realize that I have so much more control over things than I initially thought and I've never wanted to have such a thing. And now that I'm anxious, I feel this massive need to have all of this control. This was never previously a problem. But now I want to dip the fuck out of my life and run the fuck away from everything. I'm not an alcoholic, I'm not crazy, everything was fine, there's no reason to believe nothing is not fine I'm ranting and raving and making stupid decisions and overthinking and a lot of other things that don't make any sense. The moment I got drunk is the moment that I forfeited my anxiety and now it controls me. The jig is up. There's literally nothing holding me back at all. Just an invisible force inside my head that wants to fuck with me. It all makes sense. That's solid. That's logical. There's no PTSD. There's no magic. There's no nothing.

I'm going to make things clear at therapy and hopefully nip this in the butt. I've lost a lot, including a man that I really loved and some friends whom I really do care about. This is sort of the grave I've dug myself and now it's time to crawl out.",26Jul2019,3
