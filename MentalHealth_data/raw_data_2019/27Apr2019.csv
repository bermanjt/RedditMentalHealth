0,"Whenever I’m depressed, panicked, stressed, worried, any other amount of words, I think of violent things. Sometimes they involve suicide, sometimes not. I feel as if I could crack my head open with a wall, or open up my guts and tear my organs, or I want someone to puncture my throat, or cut open my veins. These feelings subside once I am over my panic or whatever, but I worry about them. I started choking myself about 20 minutes ago. I want to get this off my chest. I need to speak about this with my therapist. I worry too goddamn much and sometimes I just want the easy way out, even if it’s not for a long while.",27Apr2019,46

2,"I'm a 16 year old high school student. My homework takes me 2-3 hrs each night. At the same time i have a job. Being stressed and anxious about school is pretty normal, but even when i finish all my work and i have free time i still feel anxious and stressed about something. I haven't felt at ease in a long time. I always feel tired. 

Any advice?",27Apr2019,1
3,"I've been struggling for years to open up to anyone who can actually help (friends are great but limited with knowledge). 

I didn't go see a counselor per say but my aunt was a social worker for a while. I got to the point the other day where like always when I get frustrated I have a hard time controlling it. I punched myself twice and realized how dumb that was. I then decided to punch the ground as to not hurt myself .... But I ended up spraining my wrist. I realized I was just starting to lose control over simple frustrations and reached out to my aunt to talk about things that had been bugging me. 

Now my aunt isn't the end step but it was a step of opening up to someone who has a bit more knowledge on how to assess then a close friend. She has a history and training in the field. (granted she worked as an in home family counselor). 

It felt so good to get things off my chest. There was one kind of annoying part. I've been in my head about what exactly is wrong with me. Not to justify my shitty actions but to understand where they are coming from. I had a friend joke about how I resemble a lot of similarities ro Asperger's... At first I took offense to this claim by my friend... But I did research and they weren't wrong. I have tendecies that fall within that. 

I am much more open and willing to go see a counselor for behaviour health and my aunt even offered to go with me. I'm still nervous and scared as hell. But damn it feels a bit good to just vent today.",27Apr2019,5
4,"I’ve been in therapy for half a year because of depression and today I decided to contact my dad again after I didn’t talk to him for several months. His negligent and uncaring behaviour towards me is one of the reasons I’m in therapy in the first place. 
When I told him about the good things that were going on in my life right now (started pursuing acting, working a new job, studying) all he had to say was: so bottom line you still got no idea what to do with your life? 
That hit me pretty hard, I’ve talked to a friend about it already and basically what I feel like is that I am completely worthless. I feel like an alien compared to other humans that is not worthy of love or anything good. While I know in my head that this is bullshit this feeling is deeply rooted inside me. 
I really miss having an adult male person in my life that tells me it’s gonna be okay and that he’s proud of me. 
Has anyone made a similar experience and could make that ugly feeling go away? 
Not sure if this belongs here next therapy appointment is in 2 weeks and I really needed to vent.",27Apr2019,3
5,"Okay, just to put some context. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder, ADHD and BPD. I am currently not on proper treatment because NHS mental health services have a crazy waiting time. But that's another topic. 
My problem is, I will start laughing at random occasions. Usually it is something I find funny and I will have very long, loud laughing fit. I literally cannot stop myself, I just have to roll with it. If I'm standing I will fall to the floor and not be able to get back up until I've stopped. I can't move properly or talk properly until I have stopped. 
But sometimes it isn't a funny situation. Sometimes it's really bad. I've had laughing fits at a funeral, when someone has told me devastating news, or just general situations where there shouldn't even be a chuckle. Let alone loud unstoppable laughter. 
Don't get me wrong, this is the least of my problems. But I just wanted to know if anyone else had this? Or if they have a name for it? Because my doctor just looks at me blankly then moves on.

6,"You know that lady who changes her mind six times before she orders a coffee? Or the friend who can’t decide whether she wants to go on a road trip with you or not? Or the work colleague who obsesses over the new haircut that she hates? Or the person who cancels on your movie date at the last minute? You may call her annoying, but 18 months ago that person was me. I couldn’t make a decision to save my life, because that’s what anxiety looks like.
I think that I was born predisposed to anxiety, but perhaps it would not have smashed me the way it did had my life not been filled with what once felt like an unending rollercoaster of grief and trauma.
Or maybe it would have. I’m not sure.
Eighteen months ago, I thought I was crazy. I went from someone who had a successful career in child welfare and emergency veterinary nursing, to someone who couldn’t even go to the shopping centre alone. I went from a cardio gym-junky and health food guru, to a person who would completely freak out every time someone picked up a knife or a pair of scissors. I went from being completely independent and living alone, to someone who was scared to be alone.
It’s taken me 540 days to feel brave enough to write about my mental health breakdown-or as my close friends and I call it, my Brittney-Spears-head-shaving-fiasco. I know that all things related to mental illness are not easy, but it was anxiety and intrusive thoughts that absolutely rocked me to the core of my very being. Soul-crushingly tough and embarrassing to talk about – hence, why it’s taken me almost two years to share my story.
The anxiety I’ve experienced throughout my life has never really been textbook, or should I say, it has never been social media text book-because that is a thing, right? I’ve never experienced a full-blown panic attack, I’ve never hyperventilated, I’ve never been struck with blurry vision or sweating. For me, it was a little nausea and increased heartrate, but mostly it was a head so full of thoughts that I would sometimes feel completely out of control, so much so that at times all I wanted was to go to sleep and never wake up.
In 2017, following an abdominal surgery and 10 weeks off work, things really started to become unbearable. I would often have thoughts of slashing-not cutting, but uncontrollably slashing my arms and my feet – and I’d even sometimes have thoughts of hurting my cat, Levi. Anyone who knows me knows how much I adore my cat, he has been my closest companion for many years, so why would I ever want to hurt the one who holds so much of my heart?

The truth is, I wouldn’t. But anxiety is all about, ‘What if?’
“WHAT IF you kill your cat? How could you live with yourself? WHAT IF you drive off a bridge, but you don’t die and you’re paralysed? WHAT IF you grow old and go to a nursing home where the staff hurt you? WHAT IF your brothers die… wait do they even like you anyway? No one likes you. Everyone you have ever loved has died or left you. WHAT IF it’s all your fault?”
And no, I wasn’t hearing voices, I was suffering with anxiety and intrusive thoughts: Unwanted, horrific and disgusting thoughts. Thoughts that scared the life out of me. It was as if my mind had been hijacked and I got to a point where my mind was confused with reality, and it was scary.
Really scary.
Horrible and gruesome scenarios would often come and go, and at first, I fought hard to continue on with my busy life. Of course, no one would have ever known how bad the disaster zone of my mind really was. I tried giving up coffee, natural remedies, yoga – lots of yoga, prayer, but to be honest, nothing worked; and I went from an independent woman who had once travelled the world on her own, to a fragile girl who was scared of everything – especially her own mind.
The more I tried to harness these thoughts of gore and suicide the more savage they would become. I guess it is kind of like when someone tells you that you can think about anything in the entire world, but you are not to think about a puppy – what are you going to think about? Yes, a puppy. Well, that was sort of like what was happening to me, but I wasn’t thinking of a cute little puppy…
From what I have read, these types of intrusive thoughts are actually pretty normal – everyone has them, but more often than not they come and go too quickly for you to catch; but for someone with anxiety these thoughts don’t just come and go, they linger and the longer they linger, the more you focus on them and therefore the more you panic. It’s a nasty cycle.
At first, I was too embarrassed to tell anyone about my state of mind, mostly because I didn’t want people to think that I was some psychotic monster, but also because I’d always prided myself on being strong – I’d lost so much in my life, but I was always strong and I was always kind, someone to be admired; or, so I craved. Eventually I got to a point of breaking where I had to choose: choose to live or choose to die, because in between was too hard.
I chose to live.
'And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside; but yet you're still alive which means you must survive..’ ~ Beautiful Pain by Eminem
I called my aunty who lives on the Central Coast (about an hour north of where I was living) and I asked her for help. She then graciously invited me to come and stay with her. So, I resigned from a job that I loved, I packed up everything I owned and I brought a second-hand caravan (‘Two trailer park girls go ‘round the outside...’ Yeah, I know!) and with the help of my cousin, I renovated my soon to be home, and we moved my gypsy van onto my auntie’s property.

The renovating process in itself was very therapeutic, but I needed more than just physical labour; so, I found an amazing local GP and she prescribed me with anti-anxiety medication. And although starting the medication was really scary, it was my only option – live or die, remember.
‘...but yet you're still alive which means you must survive..’
Each morning, with the encouragement of my cousin and my aunty and uncle, I would gingerly take half of my prescribed dose.
Fast forward a few weeks and I started going to the shopping centre, but never alone. I reignited my love for almond chai lattes and thus gave me an excuse to visit the shops every day. It took about a month for me to start to visit the shops alone, and part of that courage was fuelled by the girls at the local café. They were nice girls and I knew that if I felt unsafe whilst doing my groceries, I could go to them – yes, they were sort of strangers, but I trusted them. Earth angels.
My medication was increased twice and although I was very wary, I followed my doctors’ orders - live or die. Within time I started exercising again, I began with walking my cousins’ gorgeous dog, Bo. The therapy and feeling of safety that an animal can bestow on you is unfathomable.

I’d like to tell you that the intrusive thoughts stopped straight away, but they didn’t, however they did ease.
After three months of not working I decided to return to casual work. Counselling children was too intense for someone recovering from mental illness, so I returned to my other love, veterinary nursing (yes, animals and children, no wonder I had a breakdown, right?!!) that being said, before my first shift I had no idea how I would react to being back in surgery. It turned out that I was fine. Work was good for me, it kept my mind busy. I am now currently working fulltime in both general and emergency veterinary nursing. Maybe one day I’ll return to counselling, maybe I won’t. I’m not sure yet.

My recovery has been a journey. A journey of choices – live or die? A journey of tiny steps – one almond chai latte at a time. A journey of being brave, of being real with myself. And I am doing so much better. Have I recovered completely? Well, I’m still taking my medication. I enjoy taking my medication, I see it as a blessing, so if I’m on it forever I’m completely ok with that. Last year I travelled interstate on my own and last week I drove to Sydney on my own (this in itself makes almost every person I know anxious!) and in September I plan to travel overseas on my own. My anxiety and intrusive thoughts have gone, but I think that mental health preservation will be eternally on my agenda, and it should be on yours too.
We, collectively are humanity and we must learn to be real: real with ourselves and real with each other without fear of rejection; we must learn to listen without judgment and love without agenda - everyone has a story.
If you are experiencing intrusive thoughts believe me when I say, you are not your thoughts – and you are not alone; neither do you have to yield to them or be defined by them. YOU are beautifully and wonderfully made. And although you might feel crazy and feel like you want to die right now, be brave and choose life. 

There is a plan for you, I promise.

Lots of love, Tanya xx

9," A friend who is herself a clinical psychologist suffered some distressing symptoms which were treated by repeated admissions over several years, to an expensive private clinic, where she was heavily medicated for weeks at a time, even locked up. She was told she was schizophrenic. Her family arranged a review by an independent consultant, who stated categorically that the diagnosis was wrong, and began the long, careful process of reducing and re-balancing prescription drugs. She has not been re-admitted for years. She is back working. Now getting services from the public system, she has a range of supports which were never even suggested by the expensive private clinic, - a case manager, a psych nurse who visits at home, a psychiatrist reviewing and supervising medication, group sessions, a social worker who sorted out the mess with sickness benefits, and she is happy and productive.",27Apr2019,0

13,"The other day, my little sister (16) and I (19f) were talking about the beginning of high school or whatever, sister talk, and I said “I don’t really remember anything before 7/8th grade” when she asked about something from my middle school. She said “For real, me too. I say that to people all the time but no one gets it!” and it made me think. Around that time for me, it was when I moved out of my moms house to another family members due to a guardian ship/CPS battle. For my sister, around 7th grade for her, would’ve been when our mother suddenly died.


I have difficulty remembering long term, good memories. My old houses, teachers, old pets... I can’t recall much between the ages of 11-14. It seems l can remember the end of 5th grade, but nothing from middle school other than depression, moving houses 3 times, and i remember each CPS visit.

14,"I am officially diagnosed with generalized and social anxiety and I pretty much don't question that. It's obvious to pretty much everyone.

But there's definitely more too it. All my therapists know there's more to it. They've mentioned it could be borderline but I don't think it fits - certainly some parts of it make sense but others don't fit me at all. Then I found out about histrionic, which almost feels like the forgotten personality disorder because I see it so rarely mentioned.

That one fits me well - attention seeking and desperately craving validation and heavily focused on impressing others. That's me to a tee. The problem is a lot of what's expected under historionic - it kind of clashes with the social anxiety. I don't act out but it is more fear of that social backlash, yet if I am not afraid of that backlash for whatever reason, I can be theatrical (but that's a pretty rare scenario)

I also know that mental health is complicated though, and nothing is necessarily going to fit a person exactly. I just want a name for what goes on in my head.",27Apr2019,1

I was on my way to work today, on time. I usually leaving a bit early so I can have time to relax and not feel rushed.
I’m in a great mood today is my Friday and I’m going on vacation so I’m in a mellow spirit. 
As I’m driving a police pulls me over and told me I ran a stop sign and have me a ticket. I already had a ticket from this month because of my window tints so this would be my second ticket. I tried working with the officer and explained the stop sign was not in my sight and it was a complete accident but he gave me a ticket anyway and told me I could fight it if I wanted in court. At this point I was so flustered I snatched the ticket and drove off and I was so so upset I felt like I could feel myself spiraling and getting angry. So while I was driving I just burst into tears called my brother whom is older and was sobbing hysterically on the phone to him telling him how unfair it is and he was telling me to calm down. He was telling me I needed to be more careful and it’s not a big deal and I was being “paranoid” but I was so hysteric he was making me more angry because I felt as though he was dismissing my feelings and not listening and writing off me being “paranoid” or dramatic, so I hung up on him and haven’t spoken to him all day. I feel triggered and now I’m sad and still getting ready eyed about it. This happened earlier today and I’m still emotionally upset by it and I’m trying not to let it ruin my day but I feel like I’m in a low mood.",27Apr2019,1
17,"I always read things like “you give others the power to hurt you”. And I go wow that’s very true but almost seems like an unattainable state. 
Is being mentally strong the goal? I admire headstrong people but I also admire those who admit that words have hurt them as I feel it’s more human.

&amp;#x200B;

Suicidal thoughts pop in my head all the time - not just when I'm alone or feeling depressed (For reference, I've been diagnosed Bipolar and started Lithium four months back). Sometimes it's just a passing thought but sometimes they can be very vivid. They're distracting and unwelcome, and without fail make me feel way worse. Living feels like a hassle and since I stopped hurting myself it feels like I've lost an outlet. Some days I wish I could just stop and sleep forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing though: I don't *think* I could actually kill myself? Even though I have vivid suicidal thoughts, at the same time they feel kind of distant, like its happening to someone else that just happens to be in my body. I've never in my life made a suicide attempt, and after the feelings pass (which sometimes can take hours) I can usually resume my day from there. My dad's attempted suicide twice before and every time I talk to him about it he blows it off because I have ""half my mom's DNA"" and don't have things as bad as him. The fact that I haven't been driven to try yet like my dad has, as well as all these (I assume?) disingenuous depression/suicide memes everyone's always posting online make me wonder if deep down I'm just some whiny college kid subconsciously seeking attention?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little hesitant to rush get help right now because 1.) Incorrectly describing my feelings has made things worse before (for like 4 years I've been jumping between different SSRI's before I got a new Psychiatrist who realized I was Bipolar and not Depressed), and 2.) My dad (who's experienced here) believes I don't have a problem at all. So I guess what I want to ask is this:

1.) Am I ""actually"" suicidal? How do I know if this is this a problem worth addressing?

2.) How should I go about getting help? Do any of you know any better ways to describe things?",27Apr2019,2

All day long I just daydream about a perfect life for me where I’m happy, and surrounded by loving, supportive people. Ive never had that in my existence aside from in my head and I think at this point I am completely undeserving of it and I will never be loved or cared for.

I spent my entire existence doing things for other people, trying to help everyone I can, but when I try to reach out to talk about my deep depression everyone tells me to stop “playing the victim”. They say “you’re just choosing to be depressed right now”.  I’ve been on every antidepressant, tried exercise, yoga, therapy, positive thinking, herbs, everything. All of the trauma and suffering that I have endured has left me permanently damaged, and I’m going to be stuck in this cycle of pain forever.

I’m not looking for anyone to try to say something wise or poetic to make me want to live. I just need to get these feelings out of my head. All my life I’ve felt that this is the way it would go for me. I think it’s time to start coming up with a plan for the end.",27Apr2019,1

They seem to like me when I'm there, they think I'm funny or nice or sweet, but no one ever text back, I'm never invited to anything, if I don't talk to people first no one ever talks to me.

Sometimes I convince myself that I'm just making it up and people actually like me, I'm just really sensitive, I need to let it slide, give them the benefit of the doubt and all that.

Well today it really hit me hard.

My birthday is on Wednesday. My friend's birthday, who is a genuinely really sweet, chill guy, is on Tuesday. He's always having these big parties at his house, and I always assumed that I always got invited because I've been there a bunch of times, but lately I found out that's not true, mainly because my roommate, who is not really friends with that group, started getting invited but I wasn't.

Well anyways I figured he would have a big party for his birthday this weekend because that's just his style so I bought him a drinking game yesterday as a birthday present. I texted some of my friends in that same group to let them know my birthday was coming up and we should do something, I'm trying to get a group to go with me to a cheap concert next weekend, but I basically have to beg them to go.

I texted the birthday guy earlier to see if he was doing anything, no reply. No reply from any of my other friends either.

There's no doubt in my mind that he's having a party tonight.

I feel so fucking pathetic stalking their social media to try and catch pictures of them getting ready for tonight. I've literally never done that before, what the hell is wrong with me? 

It's just a party but I'm at a really low point right now and I know I might just be getting in my own head, but if it's real it would just be confirmation for what I already know. That people don't really like me. I'm always the outsider. There's something wrong with me, and I don't know what it is.

He was the one who taught me how to speak in Spainish to my abuelita.  He taught me how to throw a football, how to play videogames, how to use a computer, even how whistle.  He was amazing, he would help anyone who needed it.  Things went downhill when he started hanging out with some of our uncle's, who were bad influences.  He got Into doing drugs and we gradually stopped hanging out often.  The last time I saw him was when he and my abuelita came for a surprise visit I was excited to see him after years of not hearing from him.  After that day we never saw him again the last I heard from him was when my uncle told us that he had disappeared to the streets.  I was heartbroken, he was a amazing person, he was the man I wanted to grow up to be, the guy I looked up to.

31,"Hey guys my name is Elijah. I'm 15 years old and I think there is something wrong with me. I've seen a lot in my life and I might as well just start from the start of my life. My mother was 16 when I was born and my father I think was the same age. I never met him but I've spoken to him over text messages. I have lived with my grandparents ever since I was a year old because my mom wasn't fit to take care of me (drug problems and a load of other stuff). I grew up alright I don't blame my grandparents for anything they cared for me and they did there best there is only so much they can do for me. I haven't been in contact with my mother for awhile now since she is too much to handle. She has bipolar disorder and borderline disorder so it's tuff talking to her. I take medication for anxiety and see a therapist monthly. I've never had many friends but I get by, I guess I just find myself being happier by myself not that I don't have friends though I have a couple at school but most of them are online. Anyway I've found I'm a very cruel person at points. It really hit me hard today realizing how fucked up I've been in the past few days. Just yesterday as a ""joke"" I threatened to kill myself if someone didn't break up with there boyfriend and it worked. I just did it to do it no other reason, I thought it was almost funny. I've done plenty things similair in the past and today I was browsing Tor chatrooms and came across this ""pedo"" lounge, I looked at a lot of CP and talked with a lot of these fucked up people but I could have cared less what they were posting and talking about. I just went with it. It isn't the first time I've seen this type of shit I've been on the web long enough to see everything there is to see. It isn't the first time I've seen this type of thing and it never bothers me, I've seen so much shit and it never bothers me I continue to watch gore videos people being slaughtered and shit and I am emotionless towards it. Not that I enjoy watching it I just watch it to watch it. I don't really dislike it either I am just neutral but I continue to look at this type of stuff. I think I have a intelligent mind for the most part. I think a lot about literally everything. I'm pretty philosophical and it's kinda funny I guess. But I'm pretty sure I'm mentally Ill, I've done fucked up shit and I could care less. But after I do it I realise that it really wasn't me doing that shit. Like today after talking to those pedos I was kinda shocked with myself as if it really wasn't me talking to those people and joining in. (I didn't contribute or promote the CP I just examined and questioned). I've been suicidal before but I never have physical harmed myself just thought about killing myself, but that was in the past I'm not particularly suicidal anymore. My sense of humour is pretty bad from an outsiders point of view. I'm not racist, homophobic or anything of the sort but my humour is completely surrounded around that kind of stuff. I joke about killing people or killing off races or torturing people, etc you get the point. I find it funny but that's the extent of it. I don't ever feel the urge to kill people or attack people it's always just been a humour thing for me I joke about with my friends. I'm pretty manipulative I think and I have attacked people mentally too many times to count and I've probably triggered depression and suicidal thoughts in some people but I just go on with my life. My family says I am one of the most intelligent people they have ever met but I don't think they trully know me to the fullest extent. My grades are dog shit in school and I will probably have to take summer school. It's not that I suck at doing work it's that I just don't do the work. I'd rather read my own books or write my thoughts down or just fuck around. Sometimes I do my work though and I don't fair bad when I get my grades. But still I almost don't care about school which is a drastic change from the past. I used to talk about wanting to get a Ph.D in theoretical physics and being a professor and writing books on physics and being a great contribution to science. Now I only do shit I like. I'm in this senior class (I'm a freshman) and we talk a lot of controversial stuff in it. I like to stir the pot in that class I can get really political and shit and I like to piss people off with politics. I'm a living troll.. I also don't really feel love. The only person I know I have actually loved is my Grandpa. I don't love anyone else I only like people. If all my family members dropped dead other than my grandpa I would probably me mournful but my life would go on as usual. I'm really numb when it comes to tragic things and emotion stuff. I know I'm talented I know I have a brilliant mind but I am a disgusting person and I don't seem to really care all that much. I just want to know what's wrong with me and I want some outside input. I know this is long and stuff but I am just pouring my thoughts out. I accept insults and criticism but I am only here for information and incite into what is wrong with me. -Elijah M.C.J.C.",27Apr2019,2

I’m too scared to go up to the people in my group because I don’t want to come across as needy or awkward. I feel like I don’t talk because I’ve been constantly reminded by teachers not to talk in class (not directed to me, just telling the class when someone was talking), and since school is the only structure in my life, I’ve depended on what teachers say. I hate that I can’t talk to others. Every time I talk to someone new, I tell myself that I can do it and maybe this’ll be the time I overcome my anxiety.

I tell myself like I tell every single one of my suicidal “friends”, that it’s not worth it, i have so much more to see in life, and it gets better.

36,"Hello Reddit, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for me but I feel like I need to say something (this is an alt-account). Sorry, this is going to be a very long post. I'm just trying to understand my life. The most relevant info is on the last few paragraphs.

So, first of all, some background. I'm U.S. American, 17, male, diagnosed about 11 years ago (it was long ago and I can't really remember) with Asperger's. When I was young, I was growing up in a bit of a rough home. My parents lived together first with my maternal grandparents, then with my paternal grandparents. As a young kid, I was living in my own world. Looking back, I feel like I was always on autopilot mode and I don't think I hardly payed attention to anything. I always would have temper tantrums and get really mad in school. I didn't care about others and was mean to pretty much everyone, and was pretty antisocial. I was also clumsy; once I remember falling halfway down a whole long flight of stairs with some 15-20 steps.

My oddness also began displaying itself here: I was so picky and paranoid that I had a slight fear more than once that my parents were poisoning me when they gave me food I didn't like, and I began thinking I'd never make it to be an adult, and would just die somehow.

As time went on, though, things changed. The relationship between my parents began falling apart. I enrolled in a different school for 2nd grade after going to summer school for 1st, and was still an antisocial a-hole kid, but I was living in the same place. My parents began growing more and more hateful to each other, and one event happened that I remember to this day: my mother appeared to be coming home from the store, and my father grabbed his hammer and nails and started hammering stuff into the top of the door. I was worried that my dad was trying to nail the door shut to keep my mom out, and it apparently took a long time for her to get in, but I don't remember enough to say it was actually being nailed shut or if it was something else. I was pretty scared nonetheless.

Stuff fell out fast. Around 2008 or so, my Dad told me he was going away for a year or so. I eventually found out from my Mom that he had been on the Internet with a woman he is still with to this day for a month or so before they seperated. They were married and would not divorce till later, but to me that was irrelevant. 

Me and my Mom eventually moved in with my (maternal) grandparents. Around this time, I was diagnosed with Asperger's; they were looking to see what is wrong with me and my mom took it as definitive. Anyways, I still hated school and was antisocial. However, by the middle of middle school (here it lasts from 5th grade to 8th grade, apologies to international readers) I began improving. I stopped getting as many disciplinary referrals, my grades began soaring, and I became less antisocial and more nonsocial (but by no means was I pleasant or had a good or very empathetic view of others to be honest). I soon started doing very good, and was put on accelerated class programs. I got to take algebra and ""living environment"" (a 9th grade biology course) a year early, and was doing very good in my classes. By 7th to 8th grade I was mostly calm, but still had bursts of rage (increasingly self-directed when they happened).

Around a year after Dad left, he did end up sort of coming back with his girlfriend, and lived about 150-200 miles from my home. I still got to visit him about monthly; things weren't perfect but I loved him and couldn't wait to see him again after I left. He happened to like video games (and still does), and me, him and my half-sister who also came up would often play games together. I kept on seeing him about monthly and over breaks and summer. I still have roughly this same arrangement with him to this day, although he and his girlfriend moved to a house about the same distance away and had a child, my younger sister.

Anyways, things slowly began changing at home. By the time I was in 8th grade, I began being expected to assume a bit more responsibility. Around the same time, my grandfather started having seizures. I remember the first time I found out he had one and what I did still crushes me; he had fallen unconscious from the seizure, I made sure he was breathing and wasn't bleeding or anything, and then just paced around the house; I was afraid to tell anyone what had happened immediately, and was terrified that I got it wrong and that he was dead. 

Thankfully he wasn't, but this wasn't the last of it. In November 2015, my grandfather got back his ability to drive after he had a seizure. One day he asked if I wanted something from the fast food place while no one was home. I thought he was acting funny, but I ignored it because I really selfishly wanted some fast food. We went, and he barely was able to pull out of the driveway, which should've been my final red flag, but I still ignored it. We started on the road, but while we were going down a not too steep hill, and my grandfather had a seizure. I was very scared and left the car and ran home, which wasn't too far away, and called 911. I ran back, and I had seen flashing lights but no car from where I left it. I kept on running down and it turned out that there was a terrible accident. No one was hurt but multiple cars were ""totaled"", including the car he was in. I was shocked and confused. I was asked questions and taken in the passenger seat of the ambulance to the hospital with my grandfather. Thankfully, no one had any major injuries, but my grandfather could never drive again. I terribly regretted that I had not even tried to park the car or something; I understand now that I never thought of doing that myself before, and was in a scary situation, but I still wonder what if. 

Around this time (late 2015-2017) I became aware that I've been a selfish a-hole, and started incessantly self-pitying myself for selfishness for a couple years, not seeing the irony at all. However, I slowly got over that beginning in early-mid 2018 and became more self-aware that I was incredibly selfish and needed to change my thinking. I kept doing well into the beginning of high school, and started getting along with people a bit better. I've had only one friend from middle school, but I managed to become better acquainted with a lot of other people. However, I was still plagued with times where I felt incredibly self-absorbedly sad. Starting around September last year, I began the process to go to university, and my mother was increasingly stressed out and putting pressure on me. I began having these about weekly-""every-two-weeks"" episodes when I would burst out in fear, self-doubting and self-hatred. My mom had often harshly criticised me for not getting things done as fast or to the extent she wanted them, and my dad began worrying about my social and general life skills. This reminds me of how I thought (and still feel occasionally to an extent) that I just can't make it past 20 or so before I starve or get shot because of social retardation or something. I now feel like I am mentally unstable and anxious; sometimes my thoughts are so scrambled that I fear they will somehow spill into the real world through my actions, yet I keep managing to get good grades and mask this as just eccentricity and oddness. I honestly don't know how, I just remember the stuff and don't study hard.

Anyways, these self-directed F.U.D. and hatred episodes keep on going on, and I'm beginning to worriedly turn to food and Internet videos I don't consider right to watch to cope with these episodes. I feel like I am at inroads in my life, and that it is time that I drop my past of self-directed cringe and learn to socially match my behavior before it's too late, but I don't know how. I don't know what's wrong with me.",27Apr2019,2

40,"How can we get help for my niece?  She's 45, with 2 daughters ages 5 and 7.  She's been slightly paranoid for years, but has decided now that her neighbors are spying on her electronically, determined to file a DCFS (Illinois child protective service) report and get her girls taken away from her.  (There's no prior reason DCFS would do that - the girls are well cared for and loved.)  She has stopped sleeping, is highly agitated  and insists that her entire home is spied on through electronic devices.  She went to her mom's house with the girls (for safety) but is also convinced that the same neighbors are also spying on her mother through the internet, TV and her mom's phone.  She also says she can hear the neighbors talking about her and also that they make sounds which only she can hear (because she has discovered she has hyper-sensitive hearing) which they diabolically make louder whenever she tries to sleep.  


According to my sister (her mom,) she has not slept at all for two nights but is spending all her time on the computer ""researching"" the problem.  My niece called the police two nights ago, who came, but basically just told her if she thought there was spyware on her phone, to take it to the service provider and have them check it.  


We aren't trying to reason with her, but we also aren't agreeing with things that make no sense.  Niece is at the point where it is dangerous for her to drive.  She has agreed she should see a counselor for anxiety and sleep issues, but won't contact one, because it's much more important to ""research"" the people spying on her and think about ways to prevent their spying.  How the heck do you get a delusional person help?  We can't physically drag her to the hospital.  And of course, we want to retain her trust so she will let us help her.  Also, obviously, she is becoming unable to care for her children, which is ironic, considering her biggest fear is that DCFS will take them away.",27Apr2019,1

43,"TW: suicide, self-harm, depression

  
I'm not really sure how to start this post, but I know for a fact that I'm losing my mind. This is probably going to be a long post so bear with me if I don't sound coherent or some parts are just overall confusing. I guess I need to vent and see if anyone has any experience with how I've been feeling. I'm not even sure how to sum it up in a tl;dr.

For most of my life, I've been a very anxious person with some depressive episodes. I grew up in a toxic household and talked to a therapist about my childhood for some time about 3 years ago. She believes a lot of my mental instability stemmed from my father's emotional abuse towards me and not having an outlet to cope - since I didn't seek help until 7 years later. After I went to a therapist, I've tried to take her advice and incorporate hobbies that could help me calm down or put me in a good mood if I ever felt overwhelmed. At times it would really help and other times I would be extremely anxious 30 minutes later.

However, the part that I can't grasp is that I was never **this** mentally unstable growing up and a lot of my irrational behavior/thoughts just started to appear. I don't exactly remember how I felt in middle - high school, but I did self-harm in middle school. That's the only thing I can remember in regards to where my mental state was at. Otherwise, my experience in high school consisted of the typical teenage drama and battles. I had low moments but it wasn't anything that was so extreme because I feel like I would remember it? I think? 

Though my mental state just went completely downhill once I entered college. I had a hard time adjusting to a new environment, routine, and workload. I will never forget the night I called my mom crying because for the first time ever, I didn't have a wanting to be alive anymore. The next day I made an appointment with a therapist (mentioned above) and finally sought help. During that time period, I just felt extremely exhausted all the time and never wanted to do anything outside of academics. I started to get anxious about EVERYTHING - walking outside my dorm, being late to class, ordering food, talking to people, driving, etc. I had some of those anxious thoughts before but they got so bad that I really didn't want to leave my dorm. I started to isolate myself and quite frankly, I didn't make friends my first year of college besides my roommates. 

Fast-forward junior year of college, I started to get better and tackled some of my anxious tendencies. I started to make friends in my college major and go out to have fun. Though my first major depressive episodes starting to appear. I would wake up in the morning and have no motivation to leave my bed. I couldn't even pull the comforter off me. One time, for two whole days, I laid in bed and just stared at my tv. It wasn't until my boyfriend at the time came over and sat in bed with me. I didn't speak a word to him, but I felt better just having him there. These episodes came out of nowhere and tend to stay for a week or two. I almost felt like I would live life platonically for some time and then everything would just go sour. It almost became a cycle and I got worried that it would never stop. So I went back to therapy for a couple of sessions until I felt overwhelmed talking to someone about all of this. Each session almost became stressful because I couldn't stand knowing I was going to cry talking to my therapist. I stopped going then a month late tried to maybe talk to a different therapist. She was wonderful in regards to advice but I just couldn't open up to her. Just like the other therapist. In every session, I would just sit there and not talk unless I was answering questions. I tried to mention some things that were bothering me but I had a hard time elaborating. So I just decided that therapy was just something that didn't work well with me. Also, since then I haven't been able to open up to anyone about how I feel. If I try... my brain goes blank and I can't formulate sentences to describe my feelings. It's like I would just shut down and isolate myself.

Senior year came and went with the same mental state. I would have cycles of ""highs"" and ""lows"". I ended things with my boyfriend at the time and then dealt with a few guys that weren't the best for me. Though during the second semester, I met my ex-boyfriend. He was the most amazing person ever. He helped me so much. I still had these depressive episodes but they weren't as bad as before. Until one day. I woke up again and felt nothing. I literally could not speak, show any emotions, or respond to my environment. I remember sitting up in bed and looking down at my hands and I had no idea whose body I was in. I was having a complete dissociation. I went into the bathroom to look at myself in the mirror and I never felt so confused. I just didn't believe that was me and started to panic. I texted my boyfriend how I felt and he immediately came home from school. I didn't say a word to him or smile when he tried to cheer me up. So he left to get us food. At some point that night, I started to feel better and talk to him about what I was feeling. Though for the next couple of days I still felt like I wasn't in my own body. It's so hard to explain how I felt, I still feel like I didn't explain it well enough.

But then everything came crashing down around October of 2018. I always had ""bad thoughts"" racing through my mind and such. However, they got extremely bad and I could never shake them. I would get paranoid at times which resulted in me lashing out at my boyfriend. Thinking he would leave me for being so mentally unstable and that I was never good enough. After I would calm down, I apologized for even having those thoughts and don't know what made me say them. In general, I just started to become depressed all the time and it took a toll on me. I would barely have the energy to do my school work, invest time in my relationship, and hang out with friends. I almost became a zombie who went to class, came back, sleep, wake up and do some homework, hang out with my boyfriend (we lived together), and then go to bed. In December, things got really bad in my relationship and my ex broke up with me. I really think that broke me down even more because since then... I haven't felt truly happy or even try to fake it. Suicidal thoughts started to appear every day and I thought about how everything I did could end my life. Especially when I drove places. 

I moved back home since I graduated from college and now every day feels like they drag on. I feel like I have nothing to live for and just lost. Not to mention, I'm back in the toxic environment - where I'm around my father. Last month, I finally tried to start dating again and rekindled with a guy (call him Joe) I used to date in high school. Though that completely backfired on me and made my mental state 100 times worse. He was verbally abusive and a narcissist. I broke things off with him a few days ago because I never hit an all-time low until I was with him. I was on the verge of committing suicide a week ago and wrote a letter to my family. The only reason I didn't go through with it was that I got to the point in my letter where I mentioned what would happen to my cats. Call me crazy, but my cats are seriously the only thing I truly live for. They mean the world to me and I just don't know what I would do if I ever lost them. So I calmed myself down and looked into going to a psychiatrist the next morning. I made an online appointment - but never heard back from them. I went to see Joe Tuesday and then Wednesday is when I broke things off with him. I had many reasons to break things, but what made me snap and do it was the fact that I had a depressive episode Wednesday and he pretty much told me that our relationship is failing because I mope around all the time. 

Now here I am. Writing this and I'm seriously questioning my mental state. I was told by Joe that I'm an extremely toxic and selfish person. For the past month, he's said some nasty things to me and at times I would just break down. My mind would go blank and I couldn't talk. However, I almost believe what he has said to me and just scared of who I am. Maybe I cause all these problems I've dealt with in the past. Maybe I'm just overreacting for attention. Though no one knows these feelings of mine. I don't know how to feel and that everything I just wrote doesn't make sense. I almost can't tell if my time frames are correct and when I started to feel this way... I've been sleeping most of the day Thursday and Friday. I just have no motivation to be alive. I mentally feel insane and unpredictable. At times, when I would wake up everything around me would feel so far away from me. I honestly don't know who I am anymore. I know for a fact that I'm calling a new psychiatrist in the morning and getting an appointment ASAP.

If you read all of this, wow thank you for putting in the time. I'm not sure why I wrote it but maybe I can look back on it when I see a doctor. I definitely forgot to mention things but I can barely remember half of it. This is all I can remember and feel like I can somewhat explain. I'm just so lost and have no idea what to do. I'm in no danger right now and I just want any personal advice/experiences. Maybe find a new way to look at things or how to help myself when I get into these moods.",27Apr2019,5

46,"Hey fella wankers and Sheilas,

So I'm preparing for what is called one of the toughest exams in the world. It needs reading several books for objective, subjective, and interview exams. 

I,a few months back was a complete mess, with alcoholism and addiction to marijuana. Also a girl whom I really liked, dumped me in the worst way possible. Thanks to God, I got my job transferred to my hometown, and now I'm with my parents (they don't know about my addictions), so that's been really helpful in tackling and subsiding the addictions.

So I met this psychiatrist, who told me that I small percentage of every type of mental illness, and even I think I do ;-p

So I'm under the following dosage: I've been using these for few months- and results have been really good- except for the lethargy

Divalproex - valproic acid - 250 mg every night

Piracetam-800mg,vinpocetine-5mg, Gingko biloba -60mg - every afternoon for memory

Fluoxetine: 20 mg morning - few days back the doc told me to increase it to 40mg

As I told, except for some lethargy and time management issues, the medicines are working for me, since I am able to concentrate on my studies better than before. 

The thing I'm really doubtful about is my doc increased the dose of Fluoxetine from what I read what was normal adult dosage. Please comment about it.

Thanks for being kind and reading.",27Apr2019,1

Without going into much detail as I'm a third party and cannot directly express feelings of my friend.

Has used many resources and still no improvement over years. Says they've seen multiple doctors and psychiatrists, been on a handful or more of different medications and to no avail. 

I'm not sure what else to add or what I'm even looking for. I guess I just want to know if there's anything they they can/should do to try to get help. Even if they've done it before. I hope someone here may be able to open up ideas or share knowledge etc.

(This is kind of long)
So I've been thinking about this for a long long time. I've talked about it with a lot of people that I trust not to disclose my personal information. But I fear that their saying things that they think I want to hear and the only person I've been able to get a real answers out of is my brother because we share the same tendencies and mind set.

Now that I've given a little background I'll start. I've never thought I was weird or different until about 2 years ago when I was talking with my friends and I asked "" If someone where to walk in that door right now with no malicious intent or threatening gesture or anything would you be able to stab them"" I said stab instead of shoot because stabbing is a lot more personal and considering the person entering has no ill will towards you it'd be considerably more difficult mentally because of the close quarters. A lot of my friends said no or if they did they'd probably have a really hard time doing it, but when I answered I realized that I'd have no real problem doing it. Like I felt no emotion thinking about the concept of stabbing someone to death. My friends who I've known for a long time kind of looked at me and said that, that was an extremely dark thought and that it was really weird. From then on I really tried to think about my emotions and how a feel about things. I found that I don't really feel a lot of things. I feel joy and I feel anger and sadness but one feeling I don't feel which kind of confused me is empathy. And when I say this I don't mean that I do bad things and don't care about it. When I do bad things that I know hurt people I learned that these are things that I shouldn't do because it effects people in a negative way. But what I notice is that I don't feel anything when I do them. It's kinda like when a dog knows it's gonna get hit when it digs in the trash so it doesn't do it because of the repercussions of it's actions. It doesn't feel bad because it got into the trash it feels bad because it's getting hit and it's owners mad at it. That might not be the best analogy but I'm not an English major. So time past I'd have spouts of nights when I'd just cry because I don't feel things like other people do and I'd wake up in the morning and just forget about these feelings or disregard them as if they where not valid. Until today. I had an extensive talk with my older brother who has been feeling the same distant and lack thereof of feelings. And when he told me he was frequently depressed and had thought of suicide before I wasn't suprised at all. The guy had been through a lot and I won't go into detail because it's private buissness, but what suprised me was that he had the same feelings as me. We talked a lot about how our family had a lot of drug abuse and mental health issues which where probably passed down to us, but the difference between us an them was that we were better adjusted to life which some how taught us how not to act and how to act without feeling anything emotionally. Idk this is getting really long. Tell me what you guys think I'd really appreciate it.

53,"So this isn't just a period blues sorta post, because it's becoming more than that, and because periods are monthly, I'm unsure what I can do about it.

Long story short (sorta) I was severally under weight for many, many years (179cm and my lowest weight was 47 kilos) so my periods stopped for a while, but for the majority of the years it was just completely irregular. For almost 2 years now I have improved my mental health and am now smack bang in the healthy range ( 70 kilos) and for almost 2 years now my periods are consistent and regular. 

Now to the point ... 

Each month, without fail my mental state completely declines, it's like a switch. 1 Week leading up to it, I feel my mind set completely deteriorate and I can almost without a fail hurt a lot of good aspects in my life. End my marriage, quit my job, end long term friendships etc, all without batting an eyelid, because in that week before my period, everything feels too hard, or ruined to me. I without a fail hit an all time low, and the depression I feel I have for the most part kicked from my life, returns head on. However, once i get my period or its nearing the end, I can't believe i would feel that way. And all is peaches and cream again. 

During this state I get myself in, although this happens every.single.month I can't even rationalize or reassure myself that this passes and it's the same damn thing because in the moment, ""this time is different"" 

I can't live like this every month. I can't keep fighting the urge to throw in the towel in all aspects of my life each month. I don't know what to do.

Info - 27, not on the pill, I haven't been for over 5 years, very major mental health problems in the family. I'm already in therapy. I've been on anti depressants in the past ( zoloft, Lexapro ) but it wasn't a good time.

Does anyone have any ideas why this is? Or is there any way of preventing this? Or is this just completely normal and because regular periods are still kinda new to me, i am just unfamiliar with how this all works?

Sorry for a period post. Thanks for your time!",27Apr2019,5
54,"Hi everyone. I am a 37 F. I have had had socially anxious traits my whole life and they used to be worse but I’ve gotten better from my 30s. Just to highlight how bad they were, I was previously married and in a pretty unfulfilling and in hindsight, emotionally abusive relationship my entire 20s and stayed because i thought I couldnt do better and had minimal friends. That’s how bad it was. Anyway, I’ve since overcome this, my 30s have been much better, and now I’ve found a lovely partner. The problem is that although I function pretty well for the most part, any big party that is about me, flares up my social anxiety big time. I had a baby shower last year and spent the whole two hours being anxious. I start getting worried that people aren’t having a good time, that they can’t hear each other, that I’m really boring and not entertaining. I start zoning in on people that I think aren’t having a good time, i then can’t concentrate on the moment, and I take it upon myself to talk to them and try to include them and then I feel really unnatural etc. if I’m at a parry that is not about me, I don’t think like this. I would never expect the person hosting a party to rescue me if I was a bit bored.
So my wedding is in September. I am getting big time anxiety thinking about it. Particularly I think that I will be boring, that I can’t dance very well (I  not sure but I think I can’t), I get all this anxiety that people will break into singing and I can’t sing.

I binge drank for many years as an escape, while also throwing myself into work. Letting people walk over me, not standing up for myself, lacking many basic life skills and knowledge that others have. I nearly collapsed under all of that weight, though was lucky to get out.

Now I find myself even further trapped/confined and wanting to escape. Haven't worked for 2.5 months now, haven't drank in over a year (or any other drug). Have been in Partial Hospitalization and now IOP group therapy, etc. for the last 5 weeks. On new medication.

It's so difficult in general but due to all the other circumstances I feel even worse equipped to be able to handle all of this.

I don’t get much attention, so when I do get the slightest bit of attention from a guy, I obsess over it and my thoughts and feeling get excited. 

So, I met up with this guy after having a nice and funny conversation over a dating app. The convo was so lively and great. We met up and for the most part it was great. I believe I probably came off “slightly” to strong out of excitement that a guy I find attractive and funny, is showing me any time of day. But fast forward to the next day, there is no conversation, and after the 3 dry text messages, no reply. Conversation ended. Totally different experience prior to meeting him. 4 days later, no text or anything from him. I take this as someone who is no longer interested. 

I’m very bothered by this, because of pre-existing self esteem problems, and also it re-affirms my thoughts of “not being a good enough” and “what’s wrong with me?” “Why am I not good enough”.  My mind wonders “How can someone decide after meeting me once, that I’m not good enough to keep in there life? Am I not worth a shot?”  I understand that no one is obligated to like me, or to care. It just really hurts feeling like you’re constantly put to the side because others won’t give you a chance. I wish I was someone that people wanted. I want to feel wanted.

* Talking to friends/having a night out.
* Watching a tv show.
* Cooking.
* Getting a good night's sleep i.e. sleeping in every once in a while. 
* Sitting in the garden and getting some sun (although being in the UK this is rare 😂)
* Exercising.",27Apr2019,1
77,"I cannot stop crying. I can't stop picturing putting a gun to my mouth and blowing my brains out. The notes I'll leave. How my mom will feel. Then I start crying again. Everything makes me want to end it and I don't know why but I can't stand these thoughts and why everything bothers me so much.

I don't want to go back on my meds. It was depakote celexa and welbutrin. I would forget them all the time so there's no point anyways. My boyfriend is starting to hate me because I'm always sad and he is not very empathetic so he tells me to cut it out stop crying etc. We're moving in a new place this week and I think he wants to leave me because he doesn't like that I'm sad.

The reason I’m writing this post is, I don’t know how to cope with this. I am completely devastated. My heart is in pieces. I am depressed and I feel like ending it right now. I have no will to live anymore.
The reason it eats me up so much is because she still tells me she loves me and all and that she isn’t ready for a relationship. That makes me feel so horrible.

79,"I was literally filling up my water bottle in the cafeteria at the elementary school where I work. I was suddenly overcome with flashbacks from a nightmare I’ve recently had, and started experiencing strange physical symptoms. 

I felt this warm, uncomfortable tingling sensation shoot from the back of my neck down my spine, and then it went up and down my limbs. It freaked me out, because I had experienced the same exact sensation earlier in the morning, but to a lesser degree. 

I started walking back to my classroom, and it felt as though I was staggering more than walking. I also noticed that my skin was extremely hot and sweaty under my clothes. It almost felt like my clothes were sticking to me. 

When I got to classroom, I made a comment about experiencing some “physiological” weirdness. One of the teachers that work on my hall was in there, and noticed that I was sweating profusely from my forehead. Another teacher buzzed the office and said that I was having a “medical emergency”. That was when I started to get upset. 

By the time the administrators and the school nurse arrived, I was crying. They quickly whisked me away to an empty room, because I can’t be wigging out in front of the kids (esp. kindergartners on the AU spectrum). 

The asst. principal ended up driving me, in my car, to my house, while another admin. followed in order to drive her back to school.

we've been on and off again like super, super close friends. i've liked him for months now and he felt the same but recently he's started working and shit so,, he's been busy to say the least. he suddenly drifted nearly completely out of my life and it's been unimaginably difficult. every mention of him gets a pain in my heart going and my throat all tight. 

last night i finally communicated how i felt about being kinda pushed aside (obviously for good reason. work and school are priorities) and how it hurt and how much i miss him and just asking what we were. he said everything i assumed was happening and it stings, a lot. it hurts so bad but this is the only close relationship that i've ever smoothed out or communicated with before kinda drifting away. it hurts to know i probably won't talk to him past the summer. 

how i feel? numb. i'm crying while writing this but i dont feel sad or anything i just feel hurt. this has happened so many times to me that i dont even think i can get sad over it, just depressed. i feel like our bond always meant more to me than to him so i guess it was time to let go and move on.

82,"        First Post on reddit, forgive me for formatting issues. TLDR on bottom. 


        This is a story about grief. I am not a writer but I stumbled on this and thought that surely there were others like me at some point in life.

        For some context, I am a female over 30, married and are fortunate enough to have enough food, water, and clothing for ourselves and two doggies, three kitties, and an angora bunny.
 
     In 2016, we got pregnant and we were really excited! I had just started a new job on base, my husband was doing very well at his job, and … WOO!!! 

       I remember that I got my baby bump at around 5 months and we were very happy that all of the appointments were going normally and everything seemed fine. Since I was over a certain age, my doctors had me go to a specialist for the ultrasounds for the second trimester as extra checkups with a specialist. 

     I remember the lady spread the goo on me and she was listening to my giddy babble while we both were watching the screen. She didn’t say much after a few minutes and excused herself. I didn’t think anything of it. The Doctor comes in with her and we all look at me image and I still hadn’t grasped that the mood had changed. The Doctor sits down and we again look, all three of us, at him focus on the baby’s head and then he pointed out the parts of the baby – a boy, as we were almost 6 months in and we had already named him. 

      He had no brain.

        No brain. Where his little skull was, where (as they explained to me) there should have been solid matter was just dark space - ie fluid. What should have been the size of a walnut (or so) there was nothing. 

       I didn’t have any idea at the time what they were trying to tell me – I must have sounded like an idiot because they had to spell it out to me that something had gone wrong and we had not caught the issue sooner because he had been too small to really see what was going on in there – not that anything could have been done about it. 

      I think I stuttered there for a few minutes; I remember seriously asking something like “Okay, so what can we do to fix this?” I have a Social Work/ Military background and Baby, there are few problems in life that can’t be eventually solved with stern determination, humor, and compassion!  So ‘What’s up, life?’ What can you throw at us that we can’t somehow solve? We can do it!!

       Not this time. His little brain couldn’t just materialize like magic. After 5 months of strong heartbeats and good bloodwork and all the other normal tests… I had never considered a genetic abnormality. I was told that there was no telling to what degree his existence after birth would be but even consciousness was doubtful. That part... That part right there was the beginning of my spiritual and emotional decline. 

      What are we supposed to do? Give early birth to him with the sole intention of killing him or letting him come to as close to term as we could but with the threat of a catastrophic miscarriage? I’m not sure which is worse, destroying what I was required by my nature to protect, my little boy; intentionally suffocating him in my womb or go in denial and insist on carrying my doomed baby? 

     My insides felt like poison.  -I- was made of poison! I POISONED MY BABY!!??  I was betrayed by nature. Here comes the anger! HOW could this happen? WHAT. THE. FUCK?!? SOMEONE HAD BETTER EXPLAIN THIS TO ME!! Let’s GO! I was ready for a FIGHT (dash of denial here!). Here comes the ugly and irrational and selfish feelings and terribly untrue bitterly angry feelings! Of anyone in my family, -I- was the emotionally, physically, financially stable one! –I- was the one who made something of myself! –I- was the only one who got UP ON MY FEET in life and SUCCEEDED and while my drug addicted/loser/broke/unmotivated/lazy relatives spit out kids when they didn’t even have the means or a PLAN to take care of themselves OR THEIR HEALTHY CHILDREN. WHAT. THE. FUCK.

      We spent quite a bit of time talking to a number of Doctors and Nurses. The Doc called my regular doctor and I remember only that he told her that he was recommending that we terminate the pregnancy immediately because this was an issue that there was no mending. What was going to happen? 

     I was going to kill him. I was going to murder my son. I’m a monster.

      How do you choose between drowning and burning to death?
We went home, called my MIL, packed a bag, and set out to go to the hospital where I would intentionally suffocate and deliver my boy.

       We get to the hospital; they knew we were coming and were welcomed with open and sympathetic arms. I was a zombie – still shocked and numb and ANGRY. The team of Nurses and Doctors explained what we would have to do and we started administering the tablets in that would induce labor. I don’t know exactly when he died inside me. I remember the point where I realized that he must be dead.

      It took about 8 hours and when the time came, I called the medical team in. They were amazing. Amazing. All of you Nurses and Doctors and medical staff that see this sort of thing (and worse!) every day; you are the best. During the worst day of my life I felt as if that staff loved me  and when I asked my husband and my MIL to leave the room, there was one nurse that held my hand and my sense of humanity while the Doctor and her two associates did their job on the other side of the stirrups.
When I pushed, he gushed right out as he was only the size of a grapefruit. I couldn’t bring myself to see him. The hospital took pictures and a footprint in case I ever wanted them but I know that if I saw him, I don’t think I could’ve handled it. I don’t think I could handle it now, three years later.

        I paid for an autopsy to see if we could find any answers – just something that could tell us why it had happened. I blamed (and still blame) myself. My brain knows that it wasn’t my fault - that it wasn’t anyone’s fault but my heart still feels differently. The guilt is crippling.

       He had something called X-Linked L9. His little intestines were going in the wrong direction in addition to the hydrocephaly in his head and his index and middle fingers were abnormally extended; but the worst news was that if we conceive another boy, there’s a 1 in 2 chance of it happening again. One of my X genes had doomed him. I killed him twice. 

        I started feeling that hateful, evil feeling of jealousy smothered in guilt every time I saw my identical twin sister with her healthy little boy. I felt it when I saw my older sister with her healthy grown boy. No one in my family had ever (to our knowledge) had any inkling that we might be carrying something like this.. but my mother had three girls… her mother had had three girls so maybe I was the first one in the family it happened to affect.
 
      Does anyone know that kind of cry that goes back and forth from a scream to a wail? Angry. Bitter. Jealous. Guilty. Weak. Needy. Anxious.

      I became: Hard to get along with. Argumentative. Emotional vampire. I blamed everything but myself for mistakes. Morale sponge.  And, since I’m trying hard to be very honest, I was, and still am, scared of everything. No one at work wanted to interact with me and I couldn’t stand to go out to see my friends outside of work. I was very alone. Lonely, but found it difficult to want to be around people and friends eventually stop calling. 


       I used to be a strong, vibrant, flirty, funny, goofy…emotionally stable.  Not anymore. I became a drinker; started smoking again. I watched my husband develop a drinking habit along with me. I’m ruining our lives because I can’t seem to let this go. Our intimate life was depressing: a few times in as many years. I had turned into a goblin – a hunched, evil, ugly, wrinkled creature that hoarded joy instead of gold.

      I became mean; lashing out at my friends and family. I became extremely bitter towards my mother and my sisters because I feel like they were silent. I felt selfishly entitled to their attention and support during this kind of situation. When I spoke to my father, all he said, “Well, it just wasn’t meant to be.” Just FYI; that’s kind of like telling someone that the Universe intended that to happen (it didn’t go over well!).
I’ve had the help of several therapists with dismally slow emotional progress but only recently discovered that I was likely going through the stages of grief – how did we not stumble onto that before? I was soo relieved to see that I wasn’t alone in this sort of thing. Holy Shit.
 
      As a caveat here; my family are not losers. They are not drug addicted degenerates. They are normal people with normal problems here and there. But, holy shit, that anger, bitterness, resentment, and assholishly arrogant attitude STILL pops up and I snap at them for little things. I’m ashamed of it because it’s unwarranted. It’s also normal but I can’t quite get my heart to forgive itself. BTW, that anger and frustration still occasionally washes over me and the shame/anxiety/bitterness/hate attaches itself to me. 

       I learned that it was normal to lose trust and confidence in one’s self but I figured that it would help to see that there are lots of people that this happens to. I’m not alone. I’m a flawed creature and although I am moving slowly, I am trying to move forward and past the anger and guilt. Three YEARS in a black hole is goddamn enough and I’m fed up with being a grumpy bitch! I wish my heart would quit draggin’ its feet.

Oh shit; this is already way too long. Thanks for reading folks. Thanks, benevolent Medical Professionals!!

83,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious about ""unusual"" mental treatment methods around the world for an article I'm writing. Ayahuasca ceremonies, coffin treatment in South Korea, etc. Share your wisdom! What are the ""weirdest"" treatments you know about?",27Apr2019,1
84,"Sorry guys, I just need to vent off after a shitty day. (17m)

I know I am different than the rest of the world. I am a special person like anyone else. Why don't people want to give me a shot/another shot to see this?

Ever since I was little I was described as being ""annoying"" or ""naughty"". If I think now I don't think I've ever been introduced to someone by my parents with some genuine pretty, colourful words. The same applies with my friends when they talked about me. I knew this, and after a while I saw the results. They started closing away and avoiding me. I was bashing my head thinking ""what did I do wrong?"" and immediately came with answers. I started changing myself for them, even for my family, but of course I did something wrong and I don't even know what, cause they started treating me like shit again. My parents didn't want me to evolve as a person, to set my own likings, all they wanted was to be in control and to feel dominant.

Highschool came and things were good for a period. Then the pressure for : starting to learn a job, to start to learn FROM GRADE 9 what I have to learn in college, while also keeping it decent in highschool. I wasn't that interested in these things set by my father, I wanted to experience highschool stuff, maybe to find someone to love me (spoiler, to this day I didn't), or to just live my life. From all the support I had (people who took my side, to just live my life) I got to almost 0, or I felt that. Again I was abandoned. Now even by the 2 persons I loved the most (my sister and my dog). 

After these things, my morale, aspirations, motivations, everything basically, dropped. I was alone and I had suicidal thoughts. I had ups and downs and I hit my lowest when I met a girl online, some months ago. The only person who I truly loved. We were both broken and I helped her get back on her feet, then she left me. I got through this too.

She changed me. Suddenly, I wanted the better for myself. I started eating more healthily, exercising (not much), trying to get out of my comfort zone, and even becoming more social. Things were great, I was finally in control of my life.

Now I feel like I am back to square one everytime I do something. I improved myself, I can see this (I am not an incel or a nice guy) and I want to be more social, even tho I am socially awkward, I want to get past this.

With whom? I think everyone still sees the old me, or I don't have an explanation. They avoid me, they lie to me, they don't care about me, and I don't know what I did wrong. Why don't people just accept me, or try to get past my ""toughness""?  or even give me a shot, from square one? I literally feel the thickness of my skin after how much I endured over the years. I ""peeled off"" my skin to let everyone see my true self, yet no one wants me. 

I don't want to think I am a failure, even tho in my mind, and from what I experienced I tend towards this, and it hurts. I know I am special and maybe I can be truly happy someday, i want to experience this before i die. my only wish.

Sorry for my bad grammar and thank you so much for listening to me!",27Apr2019,1
85,"My ex-girlfriend and I have remained close friends since we broke up four months ago. Recently, she opened up to me and told told me she has been severely depressed since we broke up. She has a new boyfriend and says that she loves him and he makes her happy (and I don't), but her overall life is just worse off. Based on what I know about her I am pretty sure she has some sort of mental illness beyond just depression, but she refuses to see a psychiatrist or counselor of any kind. I know you can't really diagnose someone here, but I hope someone can at least point me in the right direction and give general advice on how I could help her if I list some of her symptoms. 

Some things about her that seem out of the ordinary are:

She moves into and out of relationships fast. When we got together she was already talking about getting married two months in, and now she is already ""in love"" and moved in with her new boyfriend. She also seems to have a new ""best friend"" every few months.

She doesn't take criticism or rejection very well and she often misinterprets things to be more extreme than they really are. For example, I recently refused to  let her brother stay overnight at my place and for a whole week after she ignored me and then told me she wasn't talking to me anymore because she didn't want to disturb me. Which brings me to another point.

She doesn't seem to follow normal social etiquette. In the previous example with her brother she didnt even ask me ahead of time if he could stay. She just showed up and assumed I would be okay with it. She often goes through this cycle where she gets really close to someone, becomes overbearing, then feels rejected when they push back. Its like she just rotates through friends.

She is very manipulative and lies a lot. She basically just says or does anything in the moment to get her way. At times she seems like a sociopath, but she often breaks down and shows signs of remorse and empathy. And she is generally very friendly and sweet.

She has extreme moods swings. Her mood can literally change from one minute to the next. We might be making plans to take a road trip one afternoon, get packed, etc. then once we are about to leave suddenly she just wants to stay home.

She often talks out running away. The exact line she uses that I have heard word for word countless times is ""I want to go far away where nobody knows"".

She is not a good communicator. Her way of dealing with difficult situations is usually to just ignore it. She will often just get mad if you try to talk about difficult topics that need to be addressed.

She is generally immature and irresponsible, especially with money.

Any advice would be appreciated.",27Apr2019,1
86,"I have no idea if the words I’m about to type will even make sense at all, but I’m going to try and make some sense of it. About a year and a half ago, I experienced a breakup. My first girlfriend. I know, it sounds like some typical breakup mental health post, but believe me it becomes different. Anyways, this breakup was so traumatizing, and so harsh (due to abuse from both her and her family) that I feel like my brain has changed. Let me explain, I feel as though I live outside of the typical human illusion. What I mean by the typical human illusion, is this. The day to day thinking that a human is supposed to think of. The personal wants and feelings and relationships that we tend to focus on. We tend to almost think the world revolves around us, not in a selfish matter, but as a matter of importance. I live outside of this illusion. I am not suicidal, but I find myself thinking over and over about the bigger picture of humanity. The apocalypse, per say. Death looms over me and no positive feelings enter my mind. Every time I talk to someone I think, they’re going to die someday. And so am I. Dark feelings and thoughts of the unknown plague me every day. Before my trauma, I was always inside of the human illusion, the day to day thinking and cares. I was just a simple minded man that loved his hobby’s friends and family. But now I feel hollow. And the thing is, I don’t miss this relationship. I have no feelings for her and I have nothing left. No want to go back. But.. it’s like my mind is stuck in hell. As I said death looms over me. I get visions of rotten bodies and plague and death and even aliens as stupid as it sounds. Is this a sign of mental trauma? I’m really upset and need some help or mental exercises or something. I’m just asking for knowledge or help on the matter. Thank you",27Apr2019,1
87,"When I was 11, I've seen some kid friendly movie with skeletons in it. From that moment I was seeing skeletons walking slowly across my room. It happened quite often, atleast 4 times per week, but it eventually stopped. 

Last time it happened (when I was 16) I was swinging with my hand in front of me when I was walking in darkness, just to convince my brain that it was not real. My hand could just pass by them. When I got very close, they completely disappeared.

I’m in my 20s and I’ve had depression and anxiety for quite a few years (though I have been unmedicated and untreated in general for around a year) but I’m not sure if this is relevant to my issue.

Recently (within the past two months or so) there’ve been two instances that seem completely out of place for me, one in which I forgot just over a week of my life for seemingly no reason at all, and one where I seem to have completely false memories of a conversation that never happened that I was completely and utterly convinced had happened. Smaller incidents like it taking me a long time to remember things that’ve happened have also been cropping up more frequently. Having brought this up with my partner in the past, he’s mentioned it may have something to do with the abuse I suffered from childhood until I eventually moved out, citing his friend who has had memory issues due to a similar situation, but these issues have only cropped up very recently so I’m not too sure that could be to blame.

93,"So I have depression, anxiety, PTSD and a sort of eating disorder (I have methods put in place so I'm as healthy as possible and don't make the eating problems worse). This past month has been hellish for me as my PTSD was heavily triggered on accident by a friend and I haven't had the chance to work on that trauma. I've been having several panic attacks a day and so so many flashbacks that it's kinda ridiculous 😂

This week I've attempted to climb out of my mentally ill hole and organised several things to make me less stressed out (getting extensions for deadlines, delayed exams and having regular therapy sessions). As my mental health has been shit I haven't really left my room for the past month except for important meetings, which also makes things worse but it's easier to be in a safe and comfortable place to have panic attacks and flashbacks. 

For Christmas my aunt gave me a cinema gift card with enough money for about 3 films so I went to see into the spider-verse when it was in cinemas. However, this week a very little film was playing called avengers: endgame. I've been waiting for it since I watched infinity war so I was pretty excited to see it. I even stayed off Reddit this week in case any spoilers accidentally came through the cracks, which was really hard to do as Reddit is a big part of my daily routine!

So yesterday I planned out my day with bus times and buying film tickets (which I'm so happy I did because the ticket line was huge). I finally left my room and did some shopping where I bought a few things that I really wanted. Then I got to the cinema on time and, because I got my tickets in advance, I walked into a theatre with a lot of free spaces. So I sat right in the middle and had an amazing view. People also didn't sit in the seats next to me which is nice because people can give me anxiety sometimes. 

I enjoyed the film but the pacing was a little off and it was 3 hours long which was quite difficult to sit and focus on for that long. I'm glad I saw it though! 

I did have a few panic attacks and flashbacks today but I calmed myself down fairly easily using some mindfulness techniques, which I'm kinda proud of. Other than that I had a really good day and am feeling a bit better now.",27Apr2019,6

I’ve had one good week where I felt like yes this is it, I’m on an up. But now I have crashed AS ALWAYS. My thoughts are racing, I want to run away, I want to be held, I want to disappear and leave everyone behind, but I also keep telling myself no this is temporary. Get up and continue to live your life. But even when I’m trying to correct the thoughts in my mind (CBT shout out to you), my chest is still tight and my anxiety is taking over. Yes this is a result of being completely ghosted this morning after a date and also falling out with one of my best friends, who deemed it necessary to implement worry and fear into my mind, over something I should not have to worry about. I now have to pack my suitcase to go back to a different country on Monday (study abroad, where I am completely alone after not making any friends and completely hating my choice of moving to study there).  I needed this break back at home to remember that I have friends and family and I can be okay, but now this has crashed. I have to leave them behind and go far away where I’m going to be alone in this state. I fear for my next few months away, I fear for the deterioration of my mental health. I fear for another relapse. I fear that I cannot get the help I need over there (medical insurance is all so difficult and mental health is low on their priorities. Informed that I would only receive help, ONCE I end up in hospital). Despite 3 attempts at my life over the years, most recent being July before I moved, my host university abroad sent me home with a suicide hotline number and said I was too big of a case for them to handle.

95,"I'm 17 and I have anxiety.

Lately, if I have a memorable dream, I tend to believe that it's real for a couple hours after I wake up, sometimes along with dreamlike hallucinations.

I thought that a group of aliens were reading my mind and coming to kill my family because I knew too much about them. I was begging my brother to get out of bed and run away, and I knew in the moment that the aliens were using a mind ray to stop me from telling him why.

Another day, I had different paranoid ideas about how aliens could condense themselves into wave form and enter people's minds through a computer screen. I was avoiding looking at computer screens, and I heard a weird buzzing when I looked into people's eyes that made me believe they had already been infected.

The most bizarre and scary one I've had was thinking the entire world was a coloring book, and people's clothes would suddenly swap colors with the walls. I knew I was going crazy and took a bunch of stuff to sleep for a long time.

I always calm down eventually and realize I was being stupid, and these events are impossible. I talked to my therapist and didn't get my point across. She told me that the aliens weren't real which I already knew.

I'm screwed up and I wear my anxiety on my face. People always give me funny looks and laugh at me when my back is turned.

I have never used any illegal drugs and don't plan on starting anytime soon. I may have autism but was never tested.

102,"I work for a construction company and they are quite good with new initiatives and have acknowledged mental health needs to be addressed. They have introduced a 'Mental Health First Aid' course which employees can go on which basically explains spotting the symptoms of someone suffering.

This is a good initiative but speaking to someone who had been on the course and he was saying that I couldn't comment on depression and self harm as I hadn't experienced it and that I would have a different attitude if I had.

Now at work, I'm extremely outgoing confident, laughing, joking, but 10 years ago when I was 17-19 I did self harm. Even the happiness at work there is always this sad voice in my head. When I get home, I'm so sad, my mind races, I get anxious to leave the house, I think of suicide.

I want to write an anonymous letter to my CEO thanking him for the current initiatives, but make suggestions of how to help people like me who show no signs of depression, but some days I feel like I could just end it and no one would have ever seen it coming! There must be others like me who are struggling but show no signs of it.

Any suggestions please?

103,"I didn't know on which subreddit I should post this so I'm just doing it here.

Anyway to my point of matter,
Sometimes I have those weird moments where I lose complete control over my thoughts. For example, when I have a full glass of water in my hand I could suddenly think ''what'd happen if I'd drop this glass on my feet?'' or something like that. It could be something ''harmless'' as that but can go as far as when I'm waiting for a train and another train passes through the station and I think ''Would it kill me if I jumped in front of the train?'' My body never responds to those thoughts but they still scare me s*itless.

I do have a psychiatrist but we've never talked about this.

He knows this stuff annoys me and makes me feel uncomfortable and he’s still in there just watching it with no problem while I’m on the edge of tears and frustration, trying to battle my own head out of suicidal thoughts and tendencies.

105,"Here goes:


I grew up in a very dysfunctional home. This included abuse, emotional neglect, and feeling extremely unloved and unwanted. My mother was very distant and we (siblings or parents) never talked about our feelings. I grew up in a constant state of fear and I was hyper-vigilant. I never really had friends and was a loner basically all throughout school. 

Fast forward and I'm almost 30.  I've been isolating for a long time. I struggle with anxiety. I don't know how to form meaningful relationships. It's nearly impossible for me to open up to people because my childhood made me feel that talking about how we feel is a BIG no-no. I push people away (including my husband and the one friend I do have) because getting close is pretty much a foreign concept to me. I'm scared of ending up alone but at the same time it's easier (requires less energy and being open and vulnerable). I want to have people in my life but I feel this need to keep sabotaging everything that could be good. I don't get out much and sometimes lie when my friend asks if I want to hang out. But when I stay home the crushing weight of isolation is overwhelming. 

I'm emotional, I keep most things to myself, and I feel shut off. Sometimes I cry for what feels like no reason. Other times I feel hollow inside. 

I am in therapy (thank god!) and it's scary as fuck. I'm so not used to actually thinking about things. Usually they're stuffed way down inside me. Looking at my life (and how I contribute to certain things like isolation) is petrifying but I can't keep doing what I'm doing. This is no way to live. 

Anyone else?",27Apr2019,1
106,"Hi, Not too sure where to start with this one but I’m trying to figure out whether I may have some form of mental illness or condition. For months now I’ve had persistent feelings of worthlessness, loneliness and sadness, before I experienced these feelings I’d say I used to be quite a normal person- I had quite a large circle of friends and I used to do things with them on a regular basis, I would go to parties and I would talk to people. These are all things that I now physically can’t do- I feel as if I have no one, as if I’m alone, I can’t go to parties because I struggle to feel as if I’m not an intruder and I tend to feel as if everyone is talking about me, I always feel as if i’m the +1.... but never as if I’m welcomed or liked. I also now struggle to speak in a room full of people because I fear what they may think and how they may react to what I say. This has seriously affected the way I feel and go about my every day life, but I can’t even remember when this change in my emotions happened and when I lost myself. Now I can’t help but feel worthless and alone and I find every day so hard to get through where it’s now gotten to the point where I feel quite exhausted by the end of it. I frequently have thoughts of suicide and I’ve had a few instances where I’ve self harmed over the past 2 years and I have these thoughts ~every other week. It seems as if there’s no escape to the constant sadness that I’m feeling at the moment and I never stop feeling sad, alone and as if i’m unwanted by everyone around me. I very rarely experience happiness anymore unless I forget about most of the issues and try to forget about my complete sense of loneliness. I’m not sure who to speak to about all of this and/or what I should do about it/if it’s even anything. Could someone please tell me if anything is wrong and if there’s anything i can do to feel better.",27Apr2019,1

Generally, I feel really good and buzzed and alert when I'm socialising but if I'm not, I don't feel very good. I try googling the science behind this but all that comes up is articles about not wanting to socialise when depressed. It's the other way round for me.

109,"I don’t really know how to start this because there’s just so much going on. 
But I guess I’ll start with the fact that I’ve spent months online trying to figure out what’s wrong with me and I can’t find shit. The main reason I want to know is because I just want confirmation that I’m not going nuts.

Mental illness is in my family
Depression, and schizophrenic. I don’t know if they are hereditary or not though. 




This is gonna make 0 sense because I never really learned Grammar and I have no idea how to explain these things without sounding like a horrible human 

It started off as sadness and anger and now I just barely feel anything. I feel like most of my emotions are gone and I can’t feel them anymore. It’s gotten to the point where I’ll purposely make myself depressed, feel pain, scared. Because i feel more comfortable with those emotions. I don’t really have a will to go on in life anymore, things that used to make me happy are meaningless now. I just got accepted in to an art scholarship program which is something I used to really want to do and should make me happy but my reaction was just “ok”.  I feel some type of anger and sadness for everything said to me even if it’s just someone telling me to stop. It’s not really the type of Anger I usually feel but some other type combination between anger,sadness, and just not caring. My grades are slowly declining and I really want to get them back up but my motivation is gone. I have this feeling like I’m just faking the sadness because I bring it upon myself purposely sometimes (I’m usually sad already) but I’m just so used to sadness and not this empty feeling that I want to be sad again. I’m literally just done with life, I don’t have a strong desire to kill my self and self harm is rare and more often used just to make me feel something besides what ever the fuck I’m already feeling. I get depressed periods in waves where I feel depressed and suicidal for weeks. Also I’m bored constantly no matter what I’m doing. I never really thought i would have depression since I never really cared about people with depression enough to actually do some research about it. And now that I have symptoms I’m just confused. 



I can’t sleep because as soon as I try I just have horrible thoughts rushing into my head and it messes up my whole sleep cycle. I’m so tired I can’t even bother to wash my face most mornings. But I can’t sleep even though I’m tired. And I absolutely cannot concentrated anymore. 


I like seeing my own blood and torturing ants is something pretty fun for me. I’ve never hurt an animal and would never do anything to one. I’ve had multiple pets of all different specials and loved them. And things like cat and dog abuse are disgusting to me and I hate the thought of anyone even disturbing a kitten. But hurting bugs doesn’t make me feel guilty at all so I enjoy it. 

I like staying inside and I really don’t enjoy being around other people. They just make me uncomfortable and weirded out. I’ll do pretty much anything to be able to stay in my room alone with my guinea pigs.

I noticed when I was pretty young that I was different than a lot of other people so I basically started to study the other students and make myself behave like them (reactions,expressions) I experienced the same emotions as them I think but my reactions were always a bit different. I’ve built my whole life upon a fake innocent happy shy girl personality to fit in and every so often I get bored of it and change to a different one. When I’m not pretending around Others I’m a pretty dark violent person (other people tell me this I really don’t think I’m that bad) This happened before a few years ago in elementary and I got bored so I switched to being more like myself for a few years. But now I’m back to faking again because people hate me when I’m myself. I’m very good at creating these new personalities based on what the people around me like, and it’s really the only thing getting me friends. I feel like everyone does this a little bit but maybe they don’t because people tell me it’s weird. I’ve been told that I’m an incredible actor and this is probably the only reason I’m good at it. 


Most of my family members have pointed out that my facial expression rarely changes, I never noticed this until I was told. But my happy,sad,angry,excited expression is the same unless I’m faking it,laughing,or crying. I just always have a black expression I guess. 


The imaginary friends, I’ve had these imaginary friends since I was a young child and I’m fully aware that they are not real. But I just have this extreme sensation that they are watching me and now I only use the bathroom with the lights off. I’m not scared but I’m just uncomfortable. I try to distract myself when this is happening but nothing really works.


The numbers for doing things, so I don’t know if this is OCD or something but I have to do things a certain number of times. And when I say HAVE TO I mean it. And if I don’t I’ll have the weird feeling of dread,uncomfortable and just weird sensations until I do it. Also I cannot sleep if I don’t do it. I’ve been trying to overcome this but once again nothing works. 

People have also been telling me my whole life that I don’t take responsibility for anything and I’ve had probably 5-6 teachers accuse me of either just not experiencing guilt,being some type of Psycho, and being recommend to see doctors. I’ve always refused because I don’t understand what they are talking about, I’ve never harmed someone at school without a reason, and I’ve never hit without them pushing me to it. Teachers and apparently also a doctor when I was 4 have constantly told my mom that I’m too violent. But I really don’t think I’m that bad. the only thing I can agree with is I love the feeling of being in the office and lying about everything that happened. Lying just makes me happy, It just makes me feel something different for once and that makes me happy I guess? I don’t necessarily feel guilty afterwards but I just don’t like the trouble that comes after it. Ive been accused of manipulating people but I don’t really think I have. I probably sound like an asshole but at least I’m trying to get some help. 

I don’t really know what else to say but if anyone has any ideas comment below.  
If anyone’s wondering I cannot see a doctor at the moment for private reasons. So until then other types of advice are much appreciated",27Apr2019,1

111,"So I've been struggling since i was little with mental illness. I'm 24 and I live with my mother. I never really had a place to myself. I recently just lost some friends of my due to my behavior. I'm talking to a therapist and she says it might not be bipolar as well.

The story with my friends started in 2016 I met them on Tumblr. I'm a huge tmnt fan and I ended up meeting after talking about the new movie coming out at the time. I called her Rin (she was about the same age as my mom maybe a bit younger.) I was excited meeting someone older then me that loved the ninja turtle as much as i did. We started talking and she introduced me to another friend of her's her name was Holly. (Holly is a few months younger then me. Me and Rin became friends and I started to develop feelings for her. A bad habit I got is falling in love too fast. I barely new her and I already had a crush on her. I told her how i felt and to my surprise she tells me she felt the same! (Or so I thought) Turns out that the only reason she told me she liked me more then a friend is cause of stuff going on with her boyfriend. I held on to me feelings hoping she would come around but as the years I knew her go by i became obsessed with her. (Ever since I was little I had the habit of getting obsessed/ chingy with people. I start to lean on them for everything. My fear of being alone didn't help me as well.)

 Last year i found out she's going out with her friend Holly. I was so torn up, I felt like why would she pick her over me? Our friendship wasn't the same after that. I started to become jealous. I was getting to the point where I was getting desperate to find someone else to love me so I could move on from her. I felt like if I wasn't in a relationship I wasn't loved and I it could feel this empty I've been feeling. 
 Eventually I ended up with a ex co-worker as my boyfriend he was abusive and he broke up with me. I started to get even more desperate. I hated knowing they were together and i had no one! I wanted her i felt li deserved her. I started saying horrible stuff out of jealousy and rage cause I wanted Rin. I was selfish. Now they both have blocked me on Facebook and want nothing to do with me anymore. I'm alone, I don't have a friends I always chase them off. Idk what to do.",27Apr2019,2
113,I want to cry. I am stopping myself from crying because I’m scared someone will walk into my room and see me. The only person in the house is my uncle and he wouldn’t come in my room we never even talk to each other. My mum and stuff are at church. I have such a great family. My cousin was born 3 days ago and the day she was born I was thinking of overdosing a little bit to make my day easier. Not to die. But even though she wasn’t born yet I just though I’m not going to do this for her. I want her to be happy and to never feel like this so for her I’m not going to do it. My friends are great too. One of my best friends knows I’m suicidal. I tell her a lot and she tells me a lot too I’m really grateful for my friends. One of my friends is suicidal too and it made me really upset. I told my mum and I also called childlike because I didn’t know what to do. She wanted help and I said I would get her help so I told the school councillor and now they see each other every week. I saw the school councillor every week but it had stopped now no haven’t seen her in ages. I mean I’m hardly in school. I have ocd and it sucks so much. I have extreme ocd it’s really bad and I can’t move without doing a compulsion I hate it and whenever I talk or think about it I do more compulsions. Like right now I am doing more. I have anxiety too it’s part of it or something idk. I got diagnosed at 9 I didn’t really understand what they were saying at the time and they don’t focus on my anxiety just my ocd which I understand because my ocd destroys my life and is much more difficult then anxiety for me but still I would like to talk about it. Wherever I am i just think of ways to die. Like crossing the road I just think I could get run over and that’s it. I’ll be gone no more pain. Or at the train station I think of going on the tracks. I don’t want to die but then also I can’t see myself getting better so what’s the point of living my life in pain. I don’t see a point. The reason I am living is because of my friends and my mum and my brothers and my little cousins. They would be extremely sad if I was gone. A lot of people who are suicidal think they are alone and stuff but for me I know I have people. I feel selfish. I have great people in my life but I still want to die sometimes. I don’t know what to do. I’m just going to wait it out and see what happens. I care so much about my friends and when I tell them stuff about me I feel really bad because I’m making them upset. I told my suicidal friend that I’m suicidal too a long time after she told me and I kind of regret it. Her telling me made me really upset. I’m not blaming her I’m glad she told me. I’m happy she trusts me. But I feel bad because I know she is suicidal and I told her anyway. I don’t know.

115,"I've been taking care of my mother for almost 20 years. I'm 32 years old now, and I really need to have a life of my own, not to mention I'm getting tired of constant verbal abuse from her delusions.

I tried to talk to her about going to a psychologist, and my mother becomes violent, screams and refuses. I tried to call mobile crisis team but they cannot do anything unless she's threatening to hurt herself and others. When she gets violent she does say violent things like she's going to kill me, but I know that she's having an episode and will calm down shortly. I don't take it as a threat. 

I have been seeing a therapist because of the stress and she asked me to bring my mom. I been trying, but I don't think I will be able to. She doesn't leave the house because she thinks someone's going to come and steal her stuff (not valuables, things like underwear and clothes). She doesn't leave the house, and she still thinks people are stealing her things because she loses things constantly. I don't know how, she's always home so it's gotta be home right? So she assumes that me and my brother is being controlled by the people that are following her, hence the hostile attitudes towards us when she's throwing an anger tantrum breaking things, throwing things, slamming doors, screaming and cursing. 

I was 15 years old when my mom became delusional. I avoided social workers because they tried to put me in a foster home and I wanted to be with my mother (I knew she couldn't take care of us, but I was young). Now I wish I was sent to a foster home instead of quitting school to make money, so that we can have a roof over our head. It was difficult as it was to find my way in the world without a parental figure but at home, I was constantly hounded with crazy talks from my mother to leave her alone when I just wanted to be left alone after a long day of work.

I'm really getting tired, and I don't know what more I can do? I'm in New York City if that helps. I really would rather not have her handcuffed and taken away by the court. That was mentioned by the social workers last time they came. I think it would make her mental disorder worse.",27Apr2019,1

So the bullying has stopped now and I'm moving on with my life. But lately the thoughts have been coming back. Say if someone I encounter at work is being an asshole (I have to engage with the public at work, they don't always view me as a human being) or even if someone just does something to annoy me I'll kinda fantasize about attacking them. I would never do this in real life. The thoughts are kind of satisfying in the few moments after they set in but after I come to my senses I'm always shocked and upset that I could have come up with something like that.

I'm not a violent person and I don't want to do anything to people like the stuff I think about. I don't know what the thoughts mean and I don't really want to think about it too much, I just want to know how to make them stop.",27Apr2019,2

124,"Ever since I started Zoloft, I [F] have been so dry that lube doesn’t even help. I’m constantly sore, beet red, and can’t handle sex anymore because even the lightest sex makes me too sore to move. Zoloft is helping me mentally but is ruining an important aspect of my relationship. When I told my initial prescriber that this was happening, he said “ok well then don’t have sex.” Would they have said that to a man? Who knows. But ugh.",27Apr2019,12
125,"After an incredibly long relationship and bad but mutual breakup, I met my new significant other named Anxiety. I spend more time with Anxiety than anyone other than myself...jokes aside even after closed to two years, it has been difficult for me to get back into dating...I don’t know if it’s from fear of putting myself out there, the fact that I’m constantly focused on my mental ailments, or a deep seated fear of getting hurt. But I truly haven’t met someone that I have genuinely connected with during this time...maybe I am too in my own head and worried about what the other thinks of me which prevents me from connecting or maybe my anxiety is evident to others which caused them to feel anxious and prevents them from opening I don’t know. Does anyone have any advice?",27Apr2019,1
126,"I'm a 20 year old girl. I dont have any friends. I get so annoyed by everyone, family included.  Even when they realistically give me no good reason. I justify it by telling myself I dont want to be around negativity. But I'm constantly angry and sad. So maybe I'm the negativity. I even get annoyed with myself.  I work full time as a welder. I work my hardest and love my job. But I feel like I work with very lazy men. They do all say I work very hard. I dont like being touched at all. And it's lonely. When I was younger starting at 14 I used my body to feel loved. Now I hate sex. It has never been pleasant. Just annoying. I dont like talking to people about this. I have my grandparents but they dont get it. I hate people telling me what to do. I feel I should figure everything out for myself. I've had therapists. Been on countless medications. Nothing helped until I helped myself. I expect a response from anyone. I just had to get this out. It's easier when its not face to face talking. Thanks.",27Apr2019,4
127,"Sometimes I have moments where I feel really just not good. These moments sometimes come at places like school or when I am on the bus. It sucks. 

However I have started to realize that certain things are really soothing. For example I like to read. It helps distract me. I like to read at lunch at school. I cannot read as easily on the bus though. My mom and dad won't let me read certain things anymore though. I used to read a book about medicine and illnesses. They took it away because I started to get stressed about becoming sick. I also am not allowed to read things about the supernatural or dreams right now. The books I am allowed to read are still good though. 

I like to listen to music. It distracts me and the sound soothes me. It is very helpful on the bus when it becomes too loud. I sometimes bob my head to the music. It feels good

I also like certain objects. I sometimes wear the same sweatshirt for weeks at a time. Sweatshirts are comfortable. I love converse sneakers too. My mom has to remind me to take my shoes off sometimes. I have a pair that has a lot of holes. I also like my blanket and bed. Im not allowed to carry my blanket with me. I wish I could though. 

Doing certain things also helps  I like to write, colour or doodle. I also like to spin in circles. I love chairs that spin, it helps to clear my head for some reason. I also like to rock back and forth sometimes. It is soothing, although it gets me stares when I am on the bus. The bus seems to stress me out.",27Apr2019,1
128,"If you got rejected all your life, check your mental health. It will fuck up your mind. It doesn't matter how the world doesn't owe you anything - rejection hurts and denying that pain only makes it worse. 

Some people also get rejected all the time, which means that not everyone in this world has value. Some people are useless. People who tell you you're not useless tend to be VERY hostile and dangerous.",27Apr2019,8
129,"I’ve got no idea what’s happening or how I’m going to be able to sleep. I’m tired and able to start falling asleep, but once I begin drifting off I go into an immediate state of panic and wake up. It’s just happening over and over again. 

I got really fucked up last night on a lot of booze and tried a little bit of ketamine so that might have something to do with it. I don’t really know what to do now though, I’m in a state of torment. Even when I’m so tired I can’t keep my eyes open I still freak out and wake up.

Help me :(",27Apr2019,5
131,"For example: I‘m beeing told that my view of things are false. Like beeing beated isn‘t that bad and is kind of a norm.
Or that my behavior is contradicting.
Example:  I had to decide between studying food technologie or biotechnologie and my mom said to me that I‘ve got a distorted perception because I‘m not that type of human who would like to eat processed food . Even though I wamted to study something I‘m intrested in. 

I would like to know: How do you handle that kind of things?

Lately I‘ve found myself in not strong mental state and I am starting to believe that. And I know what follows it, and want to fight that cycle into depression.",27Apr2019,2
132,Does anyone else feel that they aren’t good enough? I hate myself. I can’t do the things that everyone else does daily my house is a wreck and I’m not a good enough mother for my kids. They are the only reason I’m alive probably. The only reason I want to live. I’m usually fine but not great then randomly really really down and I just want everyone to back off even though no one is even bothering me. If I go to therapy I will be feeling much better by the time I get there. It’s so awkward to ask for medication from a dr I don’t even know especially when I’m never feeling this way in the presence of a dr. Being around other people just reminds me of how much I hate myself. What is wrong with me can anyone relate?,27Apr2019,1
133,"My boyfriend is suffering from severe depression and what we believe is bipolar disorder. He is *not* suicidal so we can't use crisis hotlines to get help; we don't want to abuse the service. His mental illness is undiagnosed and untreated.

He tried going to the hospital a few months ago to get help but they didn't help him. 

**We don't know what to do! Where is he supposed to go?? How do we get him help??**",27Apr2019,2
135,"I’m in Canada if that matters 🤷🏻‍♀️

I’m just so fed up. I’ve been dealing with mental health issues since elementary school at least. I remember having huge panic attacks as early as grade 4, but I remember getting very overwhelmed at an early age and lashing out in anger (earliest memory grade 2). My family doctor prescribed my Xanax (1mg) when I was 15/16 and I was on that for a while then changed me to Clonazepam around 18 (unsure of dosage) and then finally I’ve been on Lorazepam (1mg) for the last 2.5 years. The Lorazepam does nothing for me and I feel like I’ve been worse off since, I took it consistently 2x per day for about 4-5 months and then now I just take it in the middle of major panic attacks if I remember. 

When I first got on medication, I asked my doctor for a referral to a psychologist and he denied me saying the meds would fix me. Here we are 8 years later and the meds clearly aren’t fucking working.

Seeing my family doctor is ridiculous he only works 3 days a week, goes on vacation every other month for weeks on end and then has a 2 month waitlist for appointments. I went in for a pap test last year and talked to the receptionist about getting a form for a referral even though that wasn’t what my appointment was for. I cried to her and told her I wanted to die and the meds weren’t working and she reassured me it would be okay and that she would talk to him for me and get it. She asked him, in front of me, and explained everything and he flat out said “she’s not here for that it’s not my problem”. I then cried some more and found out that the next appointment wasn’t for FOUR!! more months. 

After that, I decided to try public mental health. I went in, told them I wanted to die and after filling out at least 6 pages of paperwork I was told I was high priority/high risk. I waited 8 months to get a call. I seen my psychologist every two weeks for an hour for two months. We didn’t vibe (she treated me like a child) and then I asked for a new psychologist. She told me it would send me to the bottom of the waiting list again.

Feeling discouraged I looked online and I found some courses and paid for them and completed them. They’ve helped but I need to fucking talk to someone. I feel like I’m not being taken seriously.

I’ve been getting worse and worse since about November, that’s when things got really bad. I almost lost my boyfriend due to me constantly lashing out, after I pushed him one night. I immediately regretted it and apologized but he didn’t speak to me for a day or so. 

In February, my mother attempted suicide for the 5th time. I knew that if I didn’t try to get more help soon I would be following her down that path (I have attempted suicide 2 times before, I overdosed at 18 and my mother walked in on me attempting to hang myself at 14 or 15). 

I called and emailed multiple clinics in my town and have either been ignored (voicemails or emails) or told that they aren’t taking new patients by the people I have been able to get ahold of.  I went back to public mental health but was told that the waiting list it still the same as before. I did another intake and filled all the paperwork again. 

I’m just feeling super overwhelmed and everyday I’m getting worse. I don’t know what to do, I’ve been reaching out for almost a decade and it looks like things aren’t going to change.

I’m not suicidal, I couldn’t do that to my boyfriend. He’s really supportive of me and is calling places trying to place me himself too and has come to the intakes with me both times at public mental health. But I just don’t want to be sad and angry all the time. I’m just exhausted.",27Apr2019,2
