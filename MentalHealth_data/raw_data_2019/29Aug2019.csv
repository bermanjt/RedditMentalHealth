If you wouldn’t mind shedding any information about your first time, maybe it will help ease my mind some?",29Aug2019,1

My dad is only 45 and he has several medical issues and his chest hurts every single day from the stress she causes him…


My mom has been diagnosed schizophrenic, OCD, bipolar, depression. She has been in and out of mental institutions a few times but her last act was almost 4 years ago when she drank Draino and was involuntarily committed. They only kept her for two weeks and sent her home because she is ""stable"", but my mom is just very good at doing whatever she has to do to get out of institutions fast. 


When she is home, and my dad is working as a trick driver to put food on the table, she blows up his phone with texts harassing him...HUNDREDS of texts a day and that's not even exaggerating. She calls him the worst things possible and tells him he is a piece of shit and he should go drop dead and he is a cheater and a horrible dad and everything else in the books. She also takes it upon herself to contact ALL of the people he has ever dated and tells them horrible things about him that aren't even true and she asks his exes if they have been sleeping with him because she doesn't trust him. They always say no and tell her to leave them the hell alone but she harrasses them too. 


She is going too far now..I NEED to save my dadamd my two brothers too. I have a 13 and 26 yr old brother who is mentally 8 yrs old and she is home with them all day and there have been times where they cry so hard because she wakes them up screaming at them demanding they tell her where my dad was at in random pics from family vacations she refused to be a part of. They were camping and nothing happened but she would not leave my brother's alone and it's sad to hear about it and feel like I can't do anything. My dad is too afraid what will happen to her but he's also not even sure WHAT to do because mental institution s won't hold her for long and she refused to take any medicine. Last night she got super drunk and tried throwing a drink at him and hitting him in the face. He tried to block her hand and ended up accidentally hitting her in the back of the head. She is getting out of hand...please give me any advice you have!!",29Aug2019,2
3,I’m only posting this because my friend somehow knew that I spent to much time thinking. Even though I’ve never said anything for him to assume that.

4,"My mom for some reason just hates the meds I'm taking. She completely ignores the fact that they've been greatly reducing my psychosis, and that they've been keeping me away from suicide. She only focuses on one single side effect, that it makes it hard for me to sleep. And she uses that to argue I should get off them.

She's forced me to stop taking them before. I can't control whether I take them or not, because she refuses to let me administer it myself. And last time she did, I fell deep into a depressive hell, and turned to alcohol yet again. I've tried so hard to convince her to let me take it, but unless she gets her way, she won't ever stop.

This time, she's forcing me off them for a whole three weeks until I see my psychiatrist again (She's making these decisions completely independent of the psychiatrist), instead of the two days like last time. I don't know where I'll end up. Today is the last day I get to take them. Wish me luck.",29Aug2019,15

7,"Alright folks, I need your help. My doctor thought it might be a good idea to take some pills for my mental state. Personally, I despise them after seeing how my mother was while she was on/off them growing up. At the same time, it would be nice to feel “good@ again. I really don’t know what to do and I’d like some personal input from those who have taken them before. Did it help? Did it fuck with your head? Did it do anything at all? Side effects? Would you take them again? Anything would be helpful.",29Aug2019,32
8,"Not sure if this is where I should be posting this but, I could use some advice. My aunt has been struggling with her mental health for several years - since her marriage dissolved. My family and I have always been there to try and support her despite the fact that she has a short temper. We've tried in the past to simply do things to minimize her stress so she remains calm but lately her mental state has deteriorated to the point where she can no longer control her temper and she is extremely verbally abusive. Two days ago, she told my aunt (her sister) to ""fuck off and die"" for inviting her on an outing. We're all walking on eggshells. If you don't say one thing right (to her) she flies into a screaming, crying fit of rage. 20 minutes later, she'll be fine and pretend like nothing happened. But that's getting harder and harder for us to take. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's had a counselor for several years but I personally think it's gone past the point of just needing to ""talk"" about things and she really needs to see a doctor. I just don't know how to tell her that without her losing her mind and potentially even becoming violent. I guess I'm just kind of hoping someone on this subreddit has some experience with this kind of stuff and can lend a suggestion.

12,"I lost the remainder of medication last week and have been going through withdrawal until my repeat gets sorted. 
So many things I realise I just tried to deal with and didnt get help. 
I forgot how bad my anxiety is, I cant stop the racing thoughts like a runaway train with a million passengers all shouting different ideas on what's wrong with the train. 
My depression, which made me feel like I was under an avalanche of tasks and responsibility weighs on me, making even getting out of bed a hard task. 
All the things I fell in love with again, harder to get back into. 
I didnt really see the effects my meds had until now. 
The train still runs but much slower and the passengers have got off or are much quieter. Sometimes it even stops at the stations and is quite a pleasant for durations. 
The avalanche became a blanket and the weight became manageable. 
I struggled through until I got help and didnt realise how much a difference it actually made. It brought me  back to being the person I want to be, rather than dragged down by the failures of the person I imagined I was. 
It didn't get rid of my issues but made them manageable so much that i forgot they were there. 

if you feel like your buried under an avalanche or have a runaway train of thoughts and worries, dont fight it alone. A battle is so much harder whe you cant see what you're fighting. I know what my enemy looks, feels, sounds like. Meds are my weapon. 

Choose your weapon, be prepared for the fight! Beat your enemy and be prepared for it so you can beat it again and again! If you know your enemy and know its weakness the battle gets easier to win.

14,"Okay so I'm 18, with a suicide attempt less than a year ago, people where surprised about it and my therapist covered by insurance said I had all of my basic needs covered (mild social life, good school results, good home life and stuff like that). But yeah still diagnosed with depression (because I was depressed even I seemingly had no reason to)  and also an eating disorder.

My mother told me some months ago she has PTSD and that she worried I might too. So I went to see a therapist that specializes in PTSD, at first she told me it didn't seem like I had it, but when we talked more (a couple of sessions later) she told me I do. I've been seeing her on top of my other therapist because I do like her, and feel she helps me. 

The thing is first, I do not feel I have a good enough reason to have it (the traumatic experience). The trauma she thought I had was because of bullying and my parents shitty (possibly abusive) relationship. As far as bullying goes, it was bad but I was never physically bullied, the worst it got was getting firecrackers thrown on me or being insulted on the street (my moms village is a shitty place and the children suck). It was mostly just kids calling me ugly names and singing ugly songs about me. 

My parents relationship was a hellhole and I only remember screaming constantly. Cannot tell how much it did affect me, as far as I know from friends, parents fighting and screaming at each other is pretty common, and none of my friends have PTSD. 

Symptoms I notice is a very clear lack of memory, I dont remember a lot about my childhood, have trouble remembering a lot of stuff. I am pretty suicidal and have the other mental illnesses.

 Could I really have PTSD? 

I am sorry if it seems obvious n stuff, I have doubts about the therapist, because my mother found her and she tends to believe in a lot of spiritual stuff ( essential oils, magic semi-precious minerals, conspiracies and I just discovered I'm lacking some childhood vaccines). She tends to find doctors and other stuff in those same circles, which worries me.

All my goals for the year were shot to hell. Between that and my job I don’t know what’s more draining on my soul. I definitely see myself falling again.

18,"For a few weeks I was having a weird experience each night. 
Almost every night I wake up at some point or another. Well, one night when I woke up, it was like my dream had crossed into reality for a moment. The first night I brushed it off as my imagination. I was having a bad dream, and the creature in my dream was standing just inside my closet when I woke up, I shot up, and it was gone. 
The other one I remember explicitly was: in my dream, I kept hearing a baby crying and I was looking for it. I woke up, saw the baby on my bedroom floor, and heard it crying still. My thought was “can’t let it wake up *fiance*” and I got up, went to scoop up the baby, and there was nothing there. 
We moved the furniture around in our room so I now face the wall, and it hasn’t happened since.
Until last night, we’re staying in a hotel and I distinctly remember talking to my fiancé and him talking back in the middle of the night. He says it didn’t happen.

19,"In 12 days it will be the first anniversary of her death.

I’ve had a really rough year, it’s been my first year back in therapy and on meds, my first self harm relapse in years, first ED relapse in years, also the first time I’ve acknowledged my ED and talked to someone about it. I built up a support network and then lost it, I’m currently in the process of feeling comfortable with my new support network. I started meds and had a bad reaction (twice). 

This year feels like a lifetime. And everything that has happened in the last 2-3 years has been too much.

Recently I feel like I’ve been doing better, my meds are working and that has helped a lot. I still feel depressed and anxious or get overwhelmed sometimes but overall things feel better.

2 days ago I realised that a year ago today would be when my grandma had her stroke. For me it was very traumatic, for her she just thought she had choked on her cup of tea, the stroke damaged 1/3 of her brain and she didn’t realise or know that she’d had a stroke. One moment she was talking to me and drinking her tea, I was clearing the table after lunch, I turned around and while my back was turned she started coughing, choking on her tea. When I turned back to her she was dribbling tea and bits of toast from lunch. She knocked her mug of tea over putting it on the table. I grabbed the tissues and went to her to help her clean up, as I did tried to talk but she was slurring so much I couldn’t understand. I went to sit down next to her but as I moved to the chair she started to fall so I quickly moved back and stood there holding her up in her chair. I grabbed my phone and texted my uncle bc I didn’t know what else to do, I was panicking, I was terrified. I told him what happened and he called me immediately to tell me he was going to call an ambulance to come out to us and they would call me to talk me through everything. The next 20 minutes until the ambulance arrived was the worst 20 minutes of my life. I was shaking and crying because I thought she was going to die while I was holding her. Grandma kept patting my hand and slurring that she was ok, she just choked on her tea, she doesn’t need an ambulance she doesn’t want any fuss, am I ok? When the paramedics arrived they were immediately fantastic. Later at the hospital after grandma had been taken away for scans one of the paramedics came in to where me and my family were waiting and he said that it was a very severe stroke and that I had acted very quickly, that everyone should be proud of me and I should get a medal. I felt like such a fraud. I didn’t do anything, I stood there having a panic attack because I didn’t know what to do. Calling an ambulance wasn’t the first thing to cross my mind. Later when the doctor came in they said that because of the severity of the stroke they doubted grandma would survive until the next day. She made it through the night and then amongst her slurring she told the doctors that she wanted to go to the hospital closer to home, the one where grandpa was when he was sick before he died. Later that afternoon they put her in an ambulance and sent her off to the other hospital. Before leaving we were told again that she would probably only live for another day or two. In the end, she lived for 12 days after she had the stroke. I stayed with her in hospital a lot, me and my uncle took turns staying with her for a few days at a time. She was never alone during those days, she had so many friends and family visiting that we put a guestbook so everyone could sign a message to the family. There was so much love in that hospital room, right up until the end.

A year later and for the most part I’ve come to terms with losing her. But this last week I’ve been having dreams, I don’t remember them vividly but what I can remember is losing people. With today marking a year since the stroke it’s all catching up to me. Im feeling very overwhelmed and upset and I just wish I could be somewhere else right now. I feel like I have this huge weight on my chest right now and it’s hard to breathe. 

I have so much bottled up inside right now. I just desperately want to cry but I’m too exhausted for that. I have an appointment later today as well where all of this will probably come out and I’m just... tired. I don’t want to keep doing this. I just want my partner to come home from work and lie in bed with me holding me.",29Aug2019,1
20,"From what I remember, this experience was not enjoyable. I remember being dragged to hospitals multiple times. Against my will. When I experience psychosis, I can not come to the realization that i am a danger to myself and society. I am in a different world. I hear the television, music, overheard conversations and they all relate to me when they shouldn’t. I know I exhibit weird behavior, but it’s very rational in my mind. I think the irrational is rational. For instance, I remember almost stepping on a crack. An old saying of, “if you step on a crack, you break your moms back” roams my mind. I believed I was going to break her back, so I told my mother I’m going to avoid stepping on all cracks for no reason. Luckily I was often treated immediately and didn’t go deeper into my psychosis. During my psychosis, I presented a variety of mental issues, but the main two were bi polar and schizophrenia. I denied medication because I would think the government is after me. I believed that the medication was killing my mind, so I didn’t take it. I would repeatedly go to hospitals because I believed they were killing me. With this mindset, it was torcher. “Everyone seeking treatment, but blindly getting killed by the government” that’s what I saw in these psychiatric facilities at one point. Also, being fed food with chemicals that damage our brain. I did not feel human. I just felt like a test subject. I was part of this evil experiment that did not benefit me in any way. I came to the realization that I needed medication after my final visit. My final visit was a wake up call. I realized that I was walking in darkness with my type of thinking. These memories leave scars as I’m often triggered by minor situations. I can not watch TV with joy as I think if they say something that pertains to my reality, I’m being watched. Even conversation gives me little discomfort. It is not that I believe that my being watched is true, it’s just I have those memories of believing it. Which is triggered without my control.",29Aug2019,1

22,"I don't know how to keep this short, but I'll try. I'm a 30 F creative/tech professional who works for a huge but not well-known company. I have a history of trauma, PTSD, and ADD which I mask well but sometimes impedes me a lot. I've been rejected, abused, and disrespected A LOT in my life and anything that reminds me of that fact is hugely triggering. I don't deal well with criticism, internalize *everything*, and tend to retreat into myself when it happens.

The company culture I work in is toxic. That's a fact. There's disorganization, mismanagement, and scapegoating galore. Sycophants are rewarded, and everyone else can go fuck themselves. The managers cover their own asses and throw others under the bus to save themselves. We've had two rounds of firings, and some good people leave on their own because they couldn't take it anymore. I've managed to keep my head above the fray for the most part and accept that getting shit on is a normal part of the experience here.

I pressured my manager to give me a performance review (they don't like doing them) in July, and they didn't have anything too negative to say as well as some good feedback. They turned down my request for a raise, a title change -- ANYTHING. They told me that they could be open to paying for educational opportunities if I stumbled upon anything I wanted to take and took note of some tooling I requested to help me.

None of those things happened. My request for tooling has been slow-walked, and my boss rejected my request to expense a $500 class. (Keep in mind this is a multi-billion dollar company but they do this shit to everyone). This was a big knock to my confidence and made me feel like I have no value to this company. When my confidence gets knocked, it's hard to invest in work, but I've done my best to carry one. Unfortunately, my good work friend who I worked with closely left at the end of last month, leaving a big gap in the process. I started getting a lot of ad hoc assignments that are hard to keep up with, and with feeling depressed, my attention to detail slipped as I started to feel overwhelmed and no place to ask for help.

Last week, the shit hit the fan in my personal life. Without going into too much detail, I got doxxed and harassed on the internet by an unstable, vicious person. He slandered my name and professional reputation all over social media and tweeted my name and image at all hours for four days. He even tweeted me @ my company though I'm not sure if anyone saw it. This was profoundly stressful and the aftermath still is as I don't know if it's going to rear its head again. I told both of my managers about it in case he tried to contact them. They told me I was safe and seemed concerned for my wellbeing.

Today, I had my monthly performance check-in with my direct manager. He basically told me that my performance during the last month has been nothing short of disappointing. Nothing I've done has been up to snuff, but he wants to ""help me succeed."" (Surrrre) He enumerated something awful about just about every project I've worked on. And told me that my work is inconsistent, I require too much oversight, and I can't take direction. The only thing I've done right this month? The polls I post in Slack are funny and good for our culture. So basically, none of my extensive work on our products drives value or is good enough.

I knew I'd been a little disengaged this month, but the fact that he would tell me that my performance is suddenly terrible after I'd disclosed to him that I'm the victim of a harasser doesn't seem like a coincidence. It's clear I've been marked as a liability by these managers and should GTFO before they push me out. I'm not happy to say that I broke down in the meeting and admitted I was having a hard time with my mental health and PTSD with flashbacks (ugh, stupid, I know, but I was just so, so upset and embarrassed). He said the boilerplate manager things about that and said they could connect me to ""resources.""

I know this is the death knell for my career here. I've been in touch with recruiters and am getting submitted for jobs left and right and have some phone screenings. I think I've got about a month before I'm cut, but this is terrible for my mental health, and I'm not sure how I can stay engaged with my work here knowing that my manager wants me out. How can I continue to work here AND maintain my confidence in interviewing/job searching?

Has anyone ever bounced back from something like this? I feel like I'm living in an absolute hellscape and honestly, if it weren't for my fiance, I'd probably blow up my life -- start over in a new city -- or fucking end it.

\*TLDR:\*

Have a history of trauma. Workplace is toxic and I've been feeling stressed here for a long time but keeping my head above water. I got doxxed by a harasser on the internet. Told my managers because I was concerned about safety/him contacting them. They seemed supportive. Now, a week later, I'm getting terrible performance feedback and know I'm being pushed out of this role. I broke down crying, admitted I had PTSD and was struggling with severe stress and mental health -- bad move. Now trying to scramble to find other opportunities, but my psyche is damaged immensely by this and doesn't feel resilient enough to get through this with my career and self-worth intact.",29Aug2019,2
23,"My partner and I are a year in after discovering their childhood abuse. We’ve cut off contact with the abusers, have both been going to therapy, have been educating ourselves on all sorts of mental health topics. And things have gotten better. They’re still hard but I certainly don’t expect us to have each reached the pinnacle of our potential mental and emotional stability after ONE LOUSY YEAR. Especially since the therapy and such is a more recent portion of that. I think I have less than a dozen sessions under my belt, personally. 

If this is all that’s left to us, we won’t survive. We both individually struggle with differing amounts of suicidal ideation. My therapist knows I self harm. 

Why would she ask me to consider what would happen if things don’t get better than this? It’s eating away at my thin shell of optimism, my lifeboat belief that “things won’t be the same, but whatever the new ‘normal’ is, whether it’s in 6 months or 6 years, is bound to be better.”",29Aug2019,1

Few months ago I moved from east cost to west cost to study in university. I got some money from school funds, but not so much. So I started working in drive in restaurant. I told my friends about my life in college, and Tony heard about it too.

They just leave unspecified messages like ‘I hate that stupid bitch’ or ‘Are you still befriending that idiotic whore’ like that. Everyone knows who’s Tony talking about.

For my entire life, I've been fortunate enough to have good financial standing to receive proper help and aid(i.e. therapy, medication). 

For those unaware of my journey with mental challenges (I prefer challenges over illnesses), I come across as an intelligent, extroverted, creative and talented individual... until I don't...

When I'm triggered, whether it's something small or large, I am triggered, and unfortunately, my brain is wired to spiral into a dark hole in which it can take either days, weeks, or even months to connect back into reality and return to my ""normal"" self. 

I have been in my position for a  year and a half. Up until a few months ago, I was thriving, KPIs were being reached, continuously spotlighted by the owners of the company - really excelling in all aspects of my position. Then my, now boss, took a new role as Vice President of Marketing. Long story short, we were on amazing terms until he decided to one day yell at me for being on my laptop during a meeting. He told me that it was the most unprofessional thing he's witnessed in his entire career, and low and behold - it triggered me, bad. It took me to a low point in my life where it reminded me of a traumatic experience I had with my strict father. My work situation had been wonky for a while, but I was holding it together until that conversation.

For an entire month, I spiraled. I cried every day at work. I couldn't speak to my boss. I felt victimized by everything he said and did. I became toxic to myself and my department. Luckily, I recognized my mental state and just a week ago, I've made huge progress. I've changed my attitude at work, scheduled a therapy session - really revamped. 

Today, my boss nonchalantly tells me that he's placing me on a Performance Improvement Plan, AKA a PIP. I'm shook to my core, but I'm also not. I've been a successful, determined and hard-working individual, from school to my professional career and today I find out I've been put on a PIP. With that being said, here are a few things I'd like to get off my chest:

&amp;#x200B;

* My boss told me that no matter how much I hate his guts, I should fake my actions. He told me in the corporate world, professionalism is key. I get it, many days I purposely ignored his hi's/goodbye's and heavily sighed when he added another task on my long list of to-do. So yes, I get that, but what I sadly hate to accept is that...
* The corporate world I've experienced is extremely fake. Employees are practically required to always act like everything is A-OK and if you don't submit yourself to such behavior, then you best be ready for consequences. I listen to so many podcasts and read on so many articles, that I feel empowered to speak up or act on something when I feel like it's wrong, but society hasn't caught up to pace.
* I feel that physical illness and challenges are respected and allowed the process, but mental health is disregarded and if you're open about it then you're stripped of responsibilities and silently looked down upon. After crying in front of my boss one day, he stripped me of my social media management and gave it to my coworker without any discussion. 
* We are humans. We were designed to show emotions. How else would we react appropriately to one another, and be able to improve social interactions and abilities? By hiding true emotions and not respecting or recognizing reality isn't healthy. Obviously, extreme reactions can be assessed differently, but normal reactions like getting angry or crying should be recognized, received, and appropriate actions should be made.
* When a child cries, we find out the reasoning, assess the situation and make an effort for the cause not to happen again. When an adult cries at work, there's little assessment. Everyone ignores it or doesn't speak up, and so that emotion is being built up. 
* I realize a lot of this generates from generational differences. I read an article on how both spectrums of generations share the same goals in a work setting; however, it's just how we view the system and processes of reaching those goals that tend to hinder productivity and collaboration.

My rant is based off my personal corporate experience. I realize many have it far worse than I do, and others have it way better. Fortunately, I've learned a lot through this experience. It's inspired me in many ways, and has opened my eyes to what areas in the corporate world need improvement.",29Aug2019,5
32,"School just started (3 weeks in), and in already tired of it, I do fine in every class but math, I'm getting tired of school. I love my teachers and friends but I'm getting tired of this, but I'll push through 2 more years.",29Aug2019,6
33,"I don’t know if it’s anxiety or depression or what. My life isn’t terrible. But I constantly have different versions of my own voice in my head telling me “you’re wrong” “they hate you” “you’re wife already has someone better in mind”. I used to drink it away but I started getting really sick so I stopped. I still have my slip ups but I’m not the alcoholic I used to be. 

I’m hate being in social places because I’m always looking back to make sure no one is coming to harm me. I know no one is there but my mind is always telling me “they’re coming.” I’m supposed to go to a concert tomorrow with my wife and her father that I’ve literally been sick about all week. All I can think about is everyone being slaughtered in the middle of the show and I’m absolutely terrified. 

I recently found comfort during the day thinking of clever ways I can try to flatter my wife and perhaps lead to other things a married couple might do. I should mention she’s a low desire spouse, I’m the high desire. Now this is where my mind takes total control and I spend my evenings overthinking, sometimes to the point that I’m shivering. She’s a very athletic person and gets up very early to go to the gym. She falls asleep a lot of the times before our child does. Even if I’ve initiated something. If I say something hinting to the fact I’d like to be intimate she kind of laughs and shrugs it off. I feel pushed aside, ignored, hated. I know she doesn’t intend for me to feel that way, but all I can think is “oh she’s already been satisfied by someone else.” Which when I have a coherent moment I know is not true. But those moments are few and far between. 

There is so much more that I can get into but I don’t even know if I’m in the right place. I don’t know why I’m coming here for answers or if answers are what I’m even looking for. I guess I just want someone to tell me it’s ok.",29Aug2019,1
34,"My parent makes me go to therapy as well as school counselling. I'm so tired of it and it's just making me more afraid and angry. Whenever I tell my therapist anything she just pities me and then tells my parent what I said (despite me fucking clairfying i don't want anyone to know). I'm constantly afraid that when I go back she's going to roll my sleves up even an inch too far and she's going to see the scars, tell my parent, and then its just going to be pity and ""im so sorry you felt you needed to do this :(((( boohoo"" bullshit from the both of them. And then when we get home my parent will probably insist on monitoring everything and back it up with ""im just trying to help"" leaving me with nowhere to talk and being too afraid to do most things without being rideculed / questioned / laughed at by said parent.

I wish it was still early June, when i was in the hospital after an overdose. I still had to lie and say i overdosed because of a panic attack and ""I thought it would help"", but i felt safer there despite realizing at any moment they could say they know i'm lying and tell my parents i'm suicidal + tell them about the self harm. One of the nurses saw my arm while doing a heart scan and just said ""You're cool, guy. Don't worry"" and hell, i still think of her saying that randomly and it calms me down. Another had to ask me about it for obvious reasons but still she promised to not tell anyone aside from other doctors and she actually stuck to her promise. After she told the other doctors they made sure i was able to keep my shirt on for the most part (if they needed the other arm they asked my parent to leave) and put the IV drip on the un-affected arm. Despite the cause, the experience felt like a goddamn blessing.

Now my therapist.. if i try to open up to her it always ends with ""ok i might have to tell your parent about this"". I tell her not to but she either doesn't listen or my parent is a psychic because what i tell her gets brought up on the ride home most of the time. I cant press charges for multiple reasons and im too afraid to confront her since i dont want to embarrass myself- aaaaand i suddenly lost motivation to keep talking.",29Aug2019,2
35,"So as of late, I have been going through a bit of a dark episode. I literally created a new reddit so that I could have a sort of ‘health’ reddit that my friends don’t follow.

I didn’t really realize it until recently but the past couple of months have been really really rough for me. I gained about 30 pounds, didn’t groom myself at all, watched about 2 hours of porn a day and didn’t really leave the house as much as I should have and just stayed at home and vaped. The past couple of weeks I have been trying to improve myself in every way possible.

I started showering everyday again, got a haircut, got basic grooming equipment, started going out more and more recently have started trying to lose weight and most importantly have tried to feel better about myself.

I have wanted to feel good about myself for so long but honestly at least in the past couple years I never really have. With all my bad habits, bad body image and stuff I just never have had a ton of confidence in myself.

I just want to feel good about myself again and be proud of myself but it is really fucking hard to do that when you come from having incredibly low self esteem.

Anyway, I felt like talking about all this stuff bc I don’t really talk to anyone (but my therapist) about my personal issues. I have friends but none with depth if that makes any sense.

Would love some advice. Thanks guys.",29Aug2019,2
36,"Self- praise is a good way to come out of a depressive slump. Compliment yourself, even if its something as small as waking up early, or holding the door for a guy behind you at a gas station. Progress is key. Try and out-do yourself from yesterday. And always try to vent in any way possible. The best way for me is to draw and watch YouTube videos. Find what fits you.",29Aug2019,0
37,"I don't know if this is the right place to talk about this, but I'm going to anyways. Since I was ten I started drifting towards male things and tendencies, presenting as male for the longest time. It's six years later and I've been in therapy for about a year. My therapist believes I could be transgender after seeing her for so long, but recently I've started some SSNRIs to help my OCD and depression. With this, however, I noticed I'm not as disgusted with my body as I was prior and I'm accepting it more. I've only been on the SSNRI (Effexor) for a few weeks, but in this time when I look into the mirror I'm not absolutely defeated by having a non masculine frame. Any explanation or maybe thoughts on this? Thanks a ton",29Aug2019,1
38,"I am constantly yearning for the next thing and I am never happy in the present. I said that when I graduated college, I would be happy. When I got a job, I would be happy. I keep getting what I want but it's never good enough. It's just as lonely, just as miserable, and I keep saying I'll be happy when I get the next thing. I feel like crying every day because nothing is good enough. I feel like a spoiled brat because when I get what I want, the grass is always greener somewhere else. Granted, I'm in an environment right now that is no-doubt very toxic but even when I finally get out, I don't know if it will be good enough. Will I ever be happy?",29Aug2019,1
39,"For context I'm 16 and have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and major reacouring depression disorder when I was 13. 

For years I was screamed at by my step-dad for not being good enough not being able to hold eye contact, which made my depression escalate to the point of needing therapy until we couldnt afford it anymore. Him and my mom split almost a year ago and things were getting better until I now have to babysit my siblings for 12 hours a day cook, cleaning, etc. and I get screamed at by my mother, my sister about not doing enough and having my issues, it's to the point where I'm starting to believe them that I'm actually worthless and irrelevant, along with I'm old enough to not have these issues anymore. and im to the point I'm now have breakdowns everyday to every other day. I dont know what to do and I dont know how to help myself.",29Aug2019,2
40,"I have been trying to get help for 6 years, ive been on multiple medications that didnt work. This has scared me from taking other medications because ''they probably wont work either''. I keep getting dropped from therapy and counselling for one reason or another and my life has no meaning to me anymore.

 I feel ready to give up and i keep thinking that maybe its just my time to go. I have a 6 month wait until i can get counselling and therapy again but i cant wait that long. I think im done with life now, i dont want to suffer anymore.",29Aug2019,1
41,"As if people are always out to get me, i.e. humiliate, use, joke about me. I don’t really know why I always get that feeling, which compels me to always give 2400% to be perfect in other people’s eyes. Or just enough to get by unnoticed. 

I keep asking myself just what is it that’s wrong about me when those paranoias come, and the only things I can think of are some usual low self-esteem answers, like I’m not interesting, useful, a good friend, etc.

I kind of just wanted to vent, but is anyone go through something similar?",29Aug2019,2
42,"I struggle with depression, anxiety and minor PTSD following domestic abuse as a child, and being bullied badly in school. This makes me prone to hitting downers, particularly socially.

An example of this is when I'm in college - Sometimes, people laughing when I say something makes me feel stupid or looked down upon. This has happened recently, and along with constant rejection from job applications, I have been trying not to fall back into a dark place.

I feel like I need something to help me vent/de-stress/expel my worries and troubles. I can't draw/paint for shit. I'm a student, so it can't be too pricey. It doesn't even have to be a hobby, just something that works.

43,"Like the title says, I always feel like ""what if someone is listening to me?"" ""What if someone is watching me?"" ""What if someone is watching everything I do?"" ""What if someone has tapped into my phone?"", I always feel like I have to be perfect or else someone will do something, idk what. I reached the point where I word my phrases and posts differently so I don't get sent to mental hospital, or controlled in any way. I need my privacy, I need to be myself when I'm alone and I feel like I can't sometimes and it's driving me crazy. It comes and goes sometimes but I can't seem to shake the feeling.

And them sometimes I think my friends or family might have been watching me, and they're trying to find out what I'm like when I'm alone, and if that's happening then I'm not alone...

I've been thinking about the lyrics to *good soil, bad seeds* by *a lot like birds*, ""there is nothing to fear, there is nobody watching you, there is nobody watching you, you don't have to fall apart""

I’m was in an academy for freshmen and sophomore year so I’ve had most of my classes with the same people including this person. Today I found out they committed suicide and, although we weren’t close, I knew them a bit. They were super smart, popular, and funny.  I just can’t stop thinking about the fact that if they couldn’t get through life, how could I? The past two years I’ve managed, but as I get closer to adulthood I just don’t think I can do it. I don’t know how to drive and can’t speak without turning bright red, not to mention my sisters always telling me I’m gonna be stuck living with my parents.

Speaking out during class almost feels like the end of the world to me, even if I don’t end up saying anything. I get so stressed and overworked when a test or quiz is mentioned, I can’t focus on anything. It always feels like everyone is talking about me or pointing out my flaws or judging me. All of these things run around in my head and it’s really overwhelming.

Therapy is very expensive for me, especially since I am not at a place right now where I can afford it regularly. I am open to it though, just waiting for the right time when I can afford it.

50,"A bit about me. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and have been off of anxiety meds for about 9 months. I’m in a healthy relationship I’ve been in for a year and a half. 

So when I was 17 I was sexually assaulted (at least on two different occasions) Once at a house of some people I went to school with. I woke up with my underwear down and a finger up my vag. The other time was at a party, I vaguely remember it. I remember belong close to having sex with a guy and when he was about to put it in, I stopped him. I don’t remember much after that. The next morning I woke up with my pants off, a blanket over me, but sore down there with blood in my underwear. I think more happened, but don’t remember. Ever since this I’ve had issues sexually, in party environments, and trusting men. I went through a promiscuous phase of sleeping carelessly with multiple men, a brief phase of escorting, being attached to uninterested guys, etc. 

***This is where it gets difficult to remember***

So 8 years later , and I’m now in a relationship with someone I adore. Before the relationship, and in the early stages of it I’ve always been highly sexual and always in the mood. Recently I’ve been very withdrawn from sex with my boyfriend. During sex I find my mind drifting back to the assaults, but more recently I’ve been having childhood flashbacks. It’s a memory of an older male touching me down there, and i remember it being dry and painful. It’s clear but foggy at the same time. I don’t remember who or when, but I feel that this did happened and can’t stop obsessing over it. 

I’m now connecting other things from my childhood. I remember complaint to my mom a lot about itching and burning down there. I remember touching myself a lot, acting out sexually situations with my dolls when I was very young, and other weird feelings. 

It’s hard for me to know if this happened or not. But it’s been in my mind lately and is affecting my sex life. My boyfriend thinks it has to do with him, when it really has to do with me. He does know about the stuff that happened when I was 17, but not the others that I’m thinking of recently. 

I do have a history of suppressing/repressing memories. Does anyone else have an experience like this? Any insight would help because this is driving me insane trying to figure it out. 


TLDR: Remembering flashes of a childhood assault that may have, or may not have happened. It’s affecting my relationship. Am I losing it? Help.",29Aug2019,1
51,"I've been seeing a psychologist weekly for about a month now. This week has been the third time she's brought up meds.

My dreams have been very weird realistic and they tend to create fake memories that make it hard to distinguish from reality.

I don't enjoy or look forward to anything.

I have no motivation to do anything and the thought of having to waste my time doing assingments for uni or going out to help family make me irrationally angry.

Terrified that my friends don't really like me and are just keeping me around because they feel inclined to. Accompanied by extreme loneliness

Feeling a very strong urge to throw myself either onto the train tracks as a train passes or down an extremely steep escalator at said train station.

Sometimes go through phases where I go into full autopilot and can't absorb anything around me.

This was from basketball, which I recently started to play, and is the first real active thing I was enjoying. I am not going to able to play until around January My whole summer has been stuck on my computer because I cant really move or walk. It's not much different than my usual summer, just with more pain. But, this summer was supposed to be different. I got hired to be a camp counselor full time and I was gonna be able to finally do something I wanted with my day, and get paid for it. I was gonna get job experience and have a fun time doing it. I tried for a week and a half and I just couldn't do it. I was also supposed to start driving classes, and start visiting colleges. I also couldn't do that. My mood is just so terrible and I have no motivation or will to do anything, even though i'm recovering well. I'm starting to zone out and just sit there for way too long, with no thoughts. My mind is more numb now, and I just cant care about anything. All of my music that I have enjoyed is just so dead, and I cant find any music I like. Any games I play just bring me no joy when I win and I don't really care for them when I lose. I used to be super competitive and now I cant feel a drive for it anymore.

57,"Hi guys, I just had been really depressed in the last month or so (I have never been clinically diagnosed so I'm not sure whether am I suffering from clinical depression.)

My parents have not been very supportive of what I am doing in my life because I am very clear that getting a normal 9-5, waiting for a pay raise/promotion, isn't going to cut it for my goals, so I decided to find other ways.

Things have not been easy for me since I resigned from my job, my parents do not understand what it means to listen when I am sharing my feelings and always been rebutted by logical solutions, without acknowledging how I feel with (I don't understand why you are holding onto this baggage) or worse, ""Just let it go"". As if it was easy. Or ""Why are you wasting time with all these stupid things, go get a normal job.""

As a result, I shut myself in my room to feel safe as my house feels like a firing zone to me, but that hasn't been very helpful either. Next to my bed and computer, sources of distraction like sleeping in and playing video games became my usual habit to escape. This led to feelings of guilt/shame that I wasn't doing the things I should be doing, and letting anyone who is supporting me down. My home is truly a toxic environment

I realized I needed help when I started to entertain suicidal thoughts again (it was not the first time it happened) and this time, I felt 10000x worse than before. Luckily, my GF supports me and introduced a counsellor to me. 

I have taken steps to get out of the house and stay connected to the outside world. Hopefully, by starting this channel, I can document my own journey to hold myself accountable and also serve as a inspiration for others who might feel alone in their situation, you just have to reach out.

59,"I know it’s a big statement but I really dislike myself. I’m almost 21 and I’ve felt like this since I was about 17. Sometimes I feel a lot better and kind of mentally okay. I couldn’t concentrate at University which resulted in my dropping out and I have no idea what kind of path I am on now. Some of my friends don’t seem very keen on me lately and I honestly can’t blame them. I’ve been going for walks, eating well and doing anything I can think of to try and help my mental health but I don’t know how to improve. I have seen 4 psychologists the last few years, not long ago I felt like I was improving but I’m back at rock bottom. I can’t really find anything I like about myself so it’s hard to keep the motivation to keep trying. 

I want to have experiences and make more friends in life but I have no desire to do anything. I have seen so many of my friends go through hard times and they have pulled themselves out of it. 

I know different things work for different people but I don’t know what to try next, I feel like I will feel like this forever.",29Aug2019,1
60,"annoyed just found out practically everyone I know is diagnosed with some type of mental disorder and the take meds.

Why do they lie that they are normal And it's just who they are but then take medication to remove it

Why do they laugh at people who are different and even mentally ill when they themselves are mentally ill

Why do people want a change but they never want to make the change 

Why do they depend on mental health campaigns to spread the word and remove the stigma that THEY made 

What is wrong with people being fake and liars yes you can have your privacy yes you might not want others to know you have a problem because what will the neighborhood say but who cares and the whole neighborhood is Mental ill so what's with the taboo if they all are in their word not mine ""retarded""",29Aug2019,2
61,"My mother keeps telling me I need counseling and a lot of people online are saying something similar. I kind of understand where they're coming from, but I'm honestly happier right now than I have been in a long time. I've struggled with depression and anxiety on and off for about five years, but I'm currently on some ""happy pills"" that work very well and haven't had an episode since I started them.

The base of her argument is that I don't go out very often and don't talk to anyone other than her and my dad. I'm in (community) college, but I'm not taking any classes this semester. I was extremely unpopular in high school (to the point where people didn't want to be seen with me), so I didn't exactly have a lot of friends, but I had enough. I struggled to come to terms with not being as popular as I wanted for years. It was like a big gray cloud hanging over me for awhile, but I've come to realize that I don't *need* anyone but myself. And I don't mean to sound narcissistic in saying that, I just think it's healthy to be able to enjoy your own company. You shouldn't need other people's approval to be happy, right?

I've hung out with my friends a couple of times over the summer while they've been home from college, but I didn't feel the need to see them every day or every week or even every month like my mom assumed I would. I'm just not lonely anymore! Isn't knowing how to enjoy my own company a good thing? I don't know if it was the medication or just the long period of separation, but I've learned how to be alone. But my mom says I'm ""pushing people away because I don't want to risk getting close to the wrong person again.""

To be fair, I've done that plenty of times. At least four of my very close friends have all turned against me and made various attempts to essentially ruin my life. I'm also guilty of getting way to attached to and trying way to hard to be friends with people who wouldn't piss on my face to put out a fire. I guess I'm naive like that. I like to think the best of people and ignore their flaws. Is that a bad thing? But now I've overcome that need to be liked. I like myself and that's all that should matter, right? To carry this to its logical extreme, if I never see another human being again, I'll be just fine. I have myself! I don't need anyone else!

My mom says various other things about my ""lack of self confidence"" and ""lack of ambition,"" but that really deserves its own post. What are your thoughts, sub? Am I just more well adjusted than my mom or am I a sociopath",29Aug2019,2
62,"So I’ve always been a little anxious, moody, and closed off but I always thought that was normal. However, the past year, I started recognizing my anxious fits were quite possibly anxiety attacks and they started getting more extreme and frequent (especially since I started college last year). I started going to therapy, and I had 2 sessions. It’s really nice, but I don’t know if it’s worth the money. I’ve been improving on my own, and therapy was just another thing I wanted to do so I could actually get better. But I don’t know how much it can actually help me. They just give advice, and it seems like something you could get from a friend. I explained my anxiety attacks, and she suggested mediation on YouTube. It is good advice, but I already knew about that. Maybe it’s because I am still really early in therapy? I don’t know what to think. What do you guys get from therapy? Does it change with time? I’m really new the whole thing, so I don’t know the techniques they use and it feels weird going through this with 0 expectations of what I’m supposed to gain.",29Aug2019,1
63,I live in South East Asia and my parents don't believe in mental health issues. All my life I have been told to toughen up.

I got my IAL coming up in 3 months and I'm extremely stressed and as my focus has become worse than before. All I can do is just buy meds secretly to improve my focus and not blank out at certain times.

65,"I work in a young startup company which luckily has great company culture. The past year my mental health has completely destroyed me and i no longer feel joy in anything I do. Therefore over the last few months I’ve abused the companies work from and home and sick leave as half the time I can’t face anyone, I can’t put on a smile or pretend everything is ok.

To explain my life and what I’m going through would take too long! Instead I’ve listed below everything which is eating heavy on my mind:

- An eating disorder which I’ve had for 10 years

- Anxiety which sometimes means I don’t leave the house for days at a time

- Depression and more so the fact I nearly became and alcoholic/wanted to die last year

- Unhappy at work as I feel I can no longer progress or effectively contribute 

- Recently reporting non recent child abuse to the police (waiting for him to be arrested 

- My grandma suffering from dementia and is the only person in my family I truly live for

- Expensive tent pushed by the fact eating disorders are bloody expensive

I’d say this is my main list. Everything else is just part of life. 

Does anyone ever think that if one more thing goes wrong they’ll end it? I do. I have since my eating disorder started 10 years ago. 2 goodbye videos, 3 notes, looking over a bridge drunk out of my mind. And yet I’m still here.

I almost feel like I can't make my body do anything other than sit, sometimes masturbate, and maybe watch dumb videos on my phone thinking about how I want to be productive. This has happened a lot. This feeling of immobility. When I try to do something productive, I feel a wall come up inside of me that I can't seem to get past. What is going on? Has anyone else experienced this?

68,"So long story short it's suspected I had childhood OCD and i think i either still have it or something else is going on. Lately my obsessing has been getting worse and one of them is risky for my physical health and I'm very afraid of death and frequently obsess over the ""fact"" that I'm dying.

A few days ago all I could think was ""I am dying. But if I was dying I wouldn't appear this physically healthy. But also I could just not know if I'm dying"" and this went on for hours until I started to go into full panic with no way of rationalizing that I wasn't dying. I started freaking out and disassociating and then couldn't even recognize myself. I've stopped taking one of my medications for a non mental illness related condition because I believe that it's making me swell/gain weight (basically poison me, I also have an eating disorder) and in this episode i eventually got onto the thinking loop that all of my medications were killing me. I eventually calmed down and was able to force myself to take my medication. But I'm truly terrified of my obsessive intrusive thoughts getting this bad because I was a few minutes from calling 911.

So apparently instagram shames and censors people with scars? Am I not allowed to show my arm in public light? Do I have to fucking hide my arm when I take pictures? It's absolutely disgusting 

I've had this same thing happen in discord servers, where I have my arm in the picture and it's not the focus of the picture AT all and my shit gets deleted. I'm not ashamed of my scars, it's a part of my story and I don't want to hide it nor should I have to hide it. It's ok to have scars and I want others to know that too

I think I don’t post sometimes cause I don’t wanna bother people with my boring shit and I think that’s just depressed/anxious me talking, but also this makes me feel like an attention seeking whore, but also I’m feeling lonely and I don’t know if rambling like this is healthier to get it out or not. And I feel guilty cause I had a great day, I’m so excited for blood, and ready or not was some dumb fun with the boys, but once I get to my room i just spiral in YouTube black Holes, then spend an hour trying to sleep then don’t. I saw my therapist today but somehow just can’t seem to fully admit to how depressed I can get out loud and to someone who I don’t know what she’ll do. I do think I may need to go get my medication adjusted.

Context: been in therapy for D/A for about a year now, been on medication as long. Just got out of a very long relationship and feel like the depression is hitting me but I can’t climb out.

We are an athleticwear and lifestyle brand with a powerful mission and a vision of a world made better.

Our mission in short is to - 

1. Raise awareness for mental health

2. To tackle the problem head on and  change the lives and mental states of those who are struggling with mental health issues.

Our company comprises of 2 parts to help us achieve our mission in full. 

Part 1. Warrior Athletic. 
(The clothing brand itself) 

Part 2. The Warrior Fund.

Warrior Athletic (The clothing brand) is our vehicle for raising mental health awareness. We will be known as a mental health awareness brand meaning that each and every person who wears a piece our clothing will be raising awareness for mental health on a global scale and will also serve as a reminder to those struggling with mental health issues that they are not alone and support is available to them. 

By supporting our clothing brand you will also be actively contributing to changing the lives and mental states of those who struggle with mental health issues and that is where the Warrior Fund comes in.

The Warrior Fund is a fund we have set up to achieve the second part of our mission and it is funded by the money we make through the Warrior Athletic clothing brand. 

It is scientifically proven that being active regularly improves mental health, confidence &amp; self-image which is why 10% of every sale we make through our clothing brand will be placed into the Warrior Fund and will be used to pay for a programme we have called “Warrior Camp” which is essentially support and  free gym &amp; sports memberships for people who are struggling with mental health issues. 

We will team up with gyms, personal trainers, coaches &amp; sports clubs to support each Warrior Camp participant over a designated period of time. 

Each participant will be referred to us from a mental health charity and will receive a commencement date and a Warrior Camp Kit which will consist of 

-1 T-shirt

-1 pair of shorts

-Paid gym/sports membership 

-Access to a mindfulness app

And

-1 Personal journal to document progress, get into a routine and document goals and affirmations. 

Mental health is a global crisis and in our view, not enough is being done to raise awareness and not enough is being done to tackle the problem head on. 

We are setting out to make a difference.

We know that we cannot cover all spectrums or solve the whole issue alone but we hope that by taking this first step we will inspire others to find avenues to contribute towards change for the better.

We are not just another brand, we have set out from day 1 to change lives and we believe that with your support we can change the world in an insanely positive way.

By supporting us, you are not only raising awareness for mental health, you are supporting those who need supported and you are contributing to a cause that has the potential to make an astronomical impact.",29Aug2019,0

How do I have a right to be happy when the people in these countries have to suffer under the ineptitude of their wannabe-leaders. (I use wannabe because they are all failures at true leadership). 

I also feel abject terror at how the future is going to be if these trends dont change for the better. Climate change, wealth disparity,   racism, xenophobia, all that shit... is so... fixable... as long as fuckwads get their heads out of their asses... and again, I'm powerless to fix it.

Anyway, at lunch I try to eat and at the end of the day I’m exhausted and there’s nothing left for school work so I’m a C- student, no one’s seems to notice. When I try to talk, like when I let something slip and my mom sent me to counseling, it’s like my tongue was straight up cut out and I just silently beg for THEM to ask questions only for me to nod or give 1 or 2 word answers, and it’s not like I’m afraid or anything, I just physically can’t, that’s what nobody understands. “Oh just tell me what’s wrong! Spit it out, I won’t judge you!” I get home and I nap for about 3 hours to then stay up until early in the morning, but that’s no problem because I “wake up” when I need to be a people pleaser at 8:45 in the morning! What do I do until 3-4am? I stay away from social media, but my mains are YouTube, reddit and Spotify. Nothing even productive. I hate myself with a burning, burning passion, and sometimes that hate evolves into possible eating disorders? I barely eat throughout the day to feel ‘good’, then eat as much as I should’ve in the day, so it’s not unhealthy??? Any free second I don’t have a distraction, from talking to people to frantically skipping to the next YouTube video or podcast episode, I start thinking... and bawling... and I have a panic attack. So I avoid meditation and ALWAYS bring my phone on the bus and homework is a ticking time bomb. God forbid that mixture of “I can’t do this” and the usual “is this my life? At 15?” Not to jump around here but one of the worst factors are what all my teachers say: “she is very intelligent but she talk with her friends a lot. She has a lot of *potential.”* That’s the ticket. If I hear the word potential muttered I resist the urge to vomit. Why can’t I be adequate? I’m not smart. I don’t wanna be. Can I be stupid??? Or at least good where I am? Going up is good and all but you never get there, leading to more failure and depression, but I’m “smart.” Smart people don’t fail, idiot. No one believes me when I say “this is too advanced for me” yeah I may be in 2 extra curricular activities and in AMEB (musical instrument) grade 4 when I started 2 years ago, but I love those things, my motivation is having fun, getting fit, having a talent. What I don’t love? Advanced mapping. I wish we could just move already.

Today i'm reflecting on something horrifying that happened to me when i was 16 and i felt like sharing it for people to give any input they like. Be it relatable or explanatory in nature or whatever.

It happened instantly as i was about go to sleep. My world was turned upside down in one go. Totally black and white. I got the biggest panic attack/mental breakdown i've ever experienced. I was afraid of everything and everyone. My parents, the floor, ceiling, everything. It all manifested as a really intense irrational fear of developing schizophrenia. I knew about all of the symptoms. Hearing voices, not being able to discriminate between fantasy and real life etc. Now, i've never heard voices in my life, but my fear of it happening almost made it happen. To this day i still have no idea why it happened, and why so suddenly.

It took me two years to get out of it. It happened during a period where i had just started smoking quite a bit of weed and i had both good times and bad times on it, and i quit for good after that, so that might have something to do with it.

Thoughts?

Much appreciated.",29Aug2019,2
89,"Hello everyone, I have really been struggling with my mental health lately. The last two years of my life have been really hard. After experimenting with marijuana in 2018 and having a bad trip I haven’t been the same.  Have I unleashed something in my mind? A solid year and a half after this bad experience I had very bad depersonalization and derealization. All I did for the year and a half was google my symptoms. Even on my commute to work I would be listening to videos about mental illness. I am now positive this was not good for me. During this period I was so scared I was either becoming psychotic, schizophrenic, or delusional. I am still very much convinced I am on the cusp of a psychotic break. This month in particular ( August 2019) has been especially hard. I am even more stricken with this fear I am in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. I have had and continue to have this odd sensation in my ears, almost like a ringing sensation. Is this auditory hallucinations? I do not believe I have yet had a visual hallucinations. I feel like my thoughts have become very irrational and loud. Like I can hear my thoughts in my head not outside of my body. My mood fluctuates constantly. Two years ago I had big plans to move away and attend grad school. Now I feel like I can’t handle either because of my mentality. I am constantly researching what is wrong with me because I am very scared. I have been seeing a GP during this whole ordeal over the course of two years. She believed I am not schizophrenic. However, I cannot shake the feeling I am and it seems my symptoms are becoming worse. I would greatly appreciate any advice.",29Aug2019,1

91,"I genuinely want to see a psychiatrist. I want to get diagnosed so that I know that this isn't all in my head. I'm terrified every day that I'm just making this up and wasting people's time. I very badly want to get diagnosed. 

I also want to so that I can see what my options are. Honestly? The anxiety kills me some days and I really just want to live like a normal person...just go with my life without being worried about everything. 

I want to, but I'm only 17 yet. I don't think I can without my parent's consent or whatever. They don't want to get me diagnosed because, according to them, it can make it harder to get insurance in the future. They also insist that they'll just throw drugs at me. They're all for natural stuff but won't actually help me get ahold of the stuff for ""natural"" anxiety and depression remedies. 

I'm basically just waiting until I turn 18 in June. I don't know what steps I need to take in my life but I know that I need to do something about this anxiety so that I can live again. 

About two years ago, some stuff happened and I had a summer where I had great mental health. Fantastic mental health. I could live, I was discovering who I was, and then it ended due to circumstances beyond my control. It was the best summer of my life and I cannot express how badly I want it back.

I’ve faked this positivity and trying to enjoy my every day life but I can’t anymore. I hate it. I can’t make personal connections because I have really bad relationship anxiety, this means I have nothing I view as “real” support in my recovery, I really struggle alone because I have no confidence.

93,"Hey guys. 
I will try to keep my story short..
A while ago i realized that i’m not comfortable with myself in a way that is not normal. I stress about my appearances every day. I gained about 10 pounds over a few years, but i’m still not even close to chubby. 

I don’t understand myself, because i think i have plenty of reasons to feel great about myself. I know that objectively, i’m pretty and everyone thinks i’m beautiful and sexy. I’m capable of a lot of things... despite loads of problems i’m finishing my bachelors at age 29. 

A year ago, i had a tough battle with a nasty tumor in my spinal canal. I got surgery which went quite well, apart from some damaged nerves. My rehabilitation process was long and difficult. I had to come off high doses of opioids and lyrica, which is very hard. I had to train my legs to be able to walk again (because of damaged nerves through the surgery). I fought hard, and became healthier and fitter. Some muscles in my butt/legs are permanently affected and therefore my butt is not symmetrical because 1 muscle is disconnected from a nerve. I am able to walk, run, have sex, do everything i want. I am blessed to be healthy like i am.",29Aug2019,1
96,"Hi today is my 4th day that Ive stopped taking mirtazapine. I only took 5 doses of 15mg and then stopped. I didn't like the way they made me feel. Before them I was on sertraline and citalopram. Both of those never made me feel how mirtazapine did. It made me feel detached from myself and my world which is the worst feeling for me. Now, I feel back to normal, apart from my anxious self. I am going back on citalopram because since I came off I realised that they were actually helping me but decided to try mirtazapine anyway. I can't get an appointment with doctor, but can still get my tablets on prescription. Should I start taking citalopram again? Today? Tomorrow? I read mirtazapine is mostly out of your system within 4 days and I don't want an interaction even though I doubt one would happen. I was on 40mg citalopram, so how long do you think I should take to get back to that dose? A week on 20mg and then 40mg? I got absolutely no side effects from citalopram, only benefits. Any advice, thanks",29Aug2019,0
97,"I really think I have Borderline personality disorder. My boyfriend agrees there is something wrong with the way that I argue and see things he says it’s not normal.
I have been diagnosed with OCD and anxiety. I had severe OCD growing up. I was sexually assaulted my sophomore year of college. I started taking riskier decisions regarding sex. I didn’t want to be alone and I just wanted to find a boyfriend so badly. I slept with people on the first date or met up with people in ways I wouldn’t do now because I was so excited about the prospect of them becoming my boyfriend. Of course now I know I was just looked at for sex. 
After one of my past relationships failed because m ex said he couldn’t have feelings for someone with a sexual past like me, I started cutting myself and had suicidal thoughts.
I’m in a new relationship and hearing about my past has been tough for my boyfriend to process. I become really anxious and sometimes tell white lies about things to downplay the past because he asks about it in detail. I a lot of things came back to me that I honestly forgot about or couldn’t remember happening like I blocked it out and disassociated with my past. The lies I tell I feel are true and I just want it to be true I want my past to be over. Every time we fight I ask my boyfriend over and over again if he is breaking up with me. When we have almost broken up I had the most severe meltdown I ever had, and had suicidal thoughts. I love him so much and never want to manipulate him I just don’t want to remember or talk about my past. I am so afraid of being rejected and alone. I’ve self harmed and engaged in riskier sexual behaviors in the hope of finding a relationship. I have periods of feeling super happy and then periods of complete worthlessness or fears I’m a bad person if I don’t tell my boyfriend every last detail of my past. It doesn’t help that he hasn’t taken too kindly to my past and has yelled and screamed and almost broken up but I don’t want to lie the anxiety just becomes so much for me. I took multiple BPD tests and they all said I was likely to very likely to have BPD. What should I do?",29Aug2019,1
99,"I’ve seemed to have lost all motivation to do anything anymore; school, hanging out with friends, playing music, and even going out just feels like it’s not worth the hassle. I’m a senior in high school and I’ve been feeling this way since last year, and now it’s getting worse with the impending deadlines for college applications, and I don’t feel like I’ll be responsible enough to become an adult and run my own life by this time next year. I used to be ambitious, outgoing, optimistic, and energetic. I had a 4.7 GPA, and a passion for music, and I wanted to study it in college, but it seems like all of that has gone away. Some days I wake up and I just can’t force myself to go to school. It just feels so inconsequential now. Will this pass? Is it just a phase, or the “senior blues”? Any help is appreciated.",29Aug2019,1
100,"I've been needing help for a while now.
Things are piling up, while I thought I was strong enough, that I could deal with a lot, my breaking point passed and I don't know when.
The context is I am was diagnosed with ADD as a kid, but I am sure it's more far reaching then that, in high-school when they tested for extra time and all the third party testers were always surprised and gave me the maximum extra time.

Now I am also gay, which hurt me mentally a lot at first, when I first realized it, it went bad. Real bad. My closest childhood friends fucking hated me, I became THE school punching bag, none of the teachers did anything about it, my English teacher eventually gave me special permission to spend my lunch in the library so that I could get away from people throwing their lunch at me. That's not an exaggeration, mostly it was the same 3 boys, my old friends, who would do it, but sometimes others too, sometimes much younger kids I didn't know at all.
I know I could have stopped it, but I took it lying down which is why to continued.

But that's old news, that's stuff I learned to cope with.
Later on, I found someone else like me, a gay guy who was a decade older and wasn't hiding himself in the shadows, he was who he was and that was like a messiah to me.
Sadly he was a pedophile and he was just grooming me, I was 14 at the time, but I loved him, and he used me.
I don't know what to say or not say about it.
I was the one who brought him into my online friend group, mostly other hiding gays like myself, but most of them were closer to his age than to mine. I never dated the guy don't get me wrong, I didn't meet him in person until I was 16, but the relationship we had on text was real to me, he made me call him my brother and that's who he was to me.
He wasn't all there mentally, he was HIV+ and had syphalis, after a year or so he 'realised' that HIV doesn't exist and that it was a lie by the NWO to make spiritual warriors like himself weak from ARV medication... It's a long story that I don't care about enough to get into.

Beyond this a lot of other stuff happened too.
I grew out of him and made a life of my own. I found a boyfriend in high school I really love, and we are still together 7 years later, now adults living in another country.
But back when we first started dating, very early on, he was raped by a close friend of his, a newcomer to the same online friend group.
He drugged BF and raped him. It was a very hard time for us. People in the fried group were either convinced BF was lying, or 'we can't know what really happened, so we aren't taking sides'
I mean... What. The. Fuck.
A 16 year old kid was DRUGGED AND RAPED and all you can do is say 'maybe, maybe not, who is to know?'
I went fucking postal and burned bridges, say what you want to say, either you think he's lying or you don't, be upfront about it.
This was a defining point for us, and definitely made us stronger as a couple, but God it was hard. The rapist was still friends with many of our old friends, so many rumors spread around me and BF as a result, the common consensus was that BF tries to seduce rapist, rapist denied him and so BF spread the rape accusation as retaliation, and no one would ever fucking hear bfs side.
But whatever, life moved one, I've lost friends as a kid, now I lost friends over this, what fucking ever, who cares.
Fast forward half a decade, doing okay, my and BF move to a new county on our own, we never really recovered many friends after that, we didn't trust people all that much.
We now live on our own in a strange county we love, and on a special local holiday, while drunk, BF admits that the rape thing WAS ALL A LIE.
HE LIED ABOUT BEING RAPED FOR 5 YEARS.
All the accusations that were made, all the nights me and him would cry in bed together over it, the pain we felt. It was all a lie, a fairy tail. It was never really.


The friends who rejected me for ""lying to them"" were right. The bridges I burnt... I was the bad guy, there was no rapist. There was never a rapist...
I let an innocent man be called a rapist.
No.
I MADE AN INNOCENT MAN INTO A RAPIST.
people believed me, people actually believed me when I told them this guy raped BF.
What the fuck do I feel?
What is real?
I don't know, I don't know how I feel, I haven't since I found out more than a year ago.



But now, now of course something new comes up.
That pedophile dude I mentioned? He has late stage cancer.
Remember how he believed HIV was a lie by the new world order? Well that HIV gave him cancer.
He's probably gonna die.
So what, he was a bad guy, who cared right? Well he was my 'brother' for years, when I had no one, he was there, in his manipulative evil way sure, but he was there when no one else was.
Honestly when I found out, I felt closure, I felt like it was the way things were meant to go. But now his situation is.. Getting better.
He's getting a second chance at life.

I don't know what I feel about anything anymore, I haven't felt emotion as I know it in a long time. I go though months of feeling nothing, highlighted only by extreme anger or extreme sorrow.

I am just so lost. I don't know anymore, I just don't get it.
I don't get what's happening, I don't get what I'm supposed to feel, I don't get what I am feeling, I just hate myself at the end of the day.

I dug such a fucking deep grave for myself. I hate this.

I haven't even been able to mention half of what I I had in my head to talk about here but none of it fits, I just need to get out the complete basics, I just need someone else to hear me, I have been completely alone in dealing with this my whole life. I need help.

I don't really know myself without it anymore when I'm with friends.  This summer except for nights on weekends  I pretty much isolated myself, because I'm so effing ashamed of my facial hyperhidrosis.

I hate talking to my parents, because I hate how they share so many characteristics with me, that I hate. It gets worse everyday, I just want to leave. So I can love them again.

111,"Hey all!

Last night I experienced a mental sensation that I have never experienced before. It only lasted a handful of seconds, but it frightened and fascinated me, and I can’t stop thinking about how it made me feel. 

I also cannot find any conditions that have symptoms or first-hand accounts that quite explain what happened.

I’m hoping someone might be able to give me a name for this type of sensation as I’m growing tired of compulsive googling. 

Let me start by saying that I’ve been under a lot of stress and experiencing some high levels of aniexty these past couple of weeks, so I imagine that has something to do with it. 

**The Experience**

As I was drifting off to sleep last night I found myself in that sort of in between sleep and awake state of mind where you can consciously witness yourself start to dream - pretty normal for me. 

As this progressed, I started to feel as if everything in existence has no meaning. I couldn’t recognize myself, what I was, where I was, and I couldn’t comprehend my own thoughts. I sort of felt like that feeling you get when a word loses its meaning after saying or reading it too much (Semantic Satiation) but in a much more grand, absolute scale. Everything was foreign and nothing made sense. 

It felt very odd and I was in a state of wonder for a few seconds, but that turned into a bit of panic as I realized I didn’t understand anything. Then, it stopped and I snapped back to normal, fully awake and feeling quite off. 

I’ve seen conditions like Depersonalization and Derealization, but this didn’t feel the way those are described. 

Has anyone felt anything remotely similar to this? I find myself incredibly curious about how and why my mind ended up in this state for a short stint.",29Aug2019,2
112,So I graduated high school a few years ago but I still have a hard time dealing with a dance teacher I had for years that was verbally abusive to me. In our school we didn’t have PE because it was an art school and dance was how we received credit. I wasn’t a very good dancer when I first came in but I worked extremely hard and got much better and after that first year I joined the advanced class she taught there. In the beginning she was very nice and encouraging but over time she seemed to become hostile to everyone but especially me. She would yell and scream at me when we were dancing saying I was doing it all wrong even when I was putting in all my effort and she didn’t seem to care. I would go in every morning with the other girls and dance before she got there and always did great but as soon as she walked in the door I would freeze up because she scared me so bad. She would constantly pick on me and none of the other girls who danced either as good as me or slightly worse. She always made snide comments about my looks because I was very pale she would make fun of my skin and in the first couple semesters I took her class she would bring up my weight and call me fat in front of the entire class. She also did this with any of the other girls who were slightly out of shape too. I was never extremely overweight in high school either I was a little chubby but I leaned out a lot my junior and senior year; and when she did notice I was thin she took credit for it saying she cause me to lose weight in front of everyone again and shamed the younger girls about their weight. I just remember every day walking into school with so much anxiety to go into dance because I knew she would target me and scream about how horrible I was and she would often accuse me of having some sort of disability; she asked me in front of everyone if I had dyslexia which I didn’t and I almost burst into tears after she asked me. I probably should have dropped out of the class when this first started going on; but she would guilt us into staying saying that we wouldn’t be anything if we weren’t performers and having a normal job was a disgrace. I am writing this now because it has weighed on me for so long and my self esteem. This woman caused me to have horrible insecurities and caused me to have a disordered relationship with food and exercise which I am still dealing with to this day. I used to love dancing and now I won’t even do it because every time I do I feel she’s watching me getting ready to scream at me or she’s laughing at me.

- ""Perceived Coercion During Admission Into Psychiatric Hospitalization Increases Risk of Suicide Attempts After Discharge."" 

--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162700

**Controls:**

This study controlled for suicidal history &amp; base suicideality- it can't be dismissed by simply saying those hospitalized were already at risk of suicide.

**Clarification:**

Psychiatrists often claim people are ""voluntarily"" hospitalized even if the person did was threatened by state officials, threatened by family, or just lied to &amp; misled into such ""help.""

Really *if the victim believes they were coerced into ""hospitalization"" their suicide rate is increased.*

---

Next, YSK psychiatrist's opinions on who's ""high risk"" for suicide are baseless.

**ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:**

- ""About 3% of patients categorized as being at high risk can be expected to commit suicide in the year after discharge. **However, about 60% of the patients who commit suicide are likely to be categorized as low risk.** Risk categorization is of no value in attempts to decrease the numbers of patients who will commit suicide after discharge.""

-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21740345

Next YSK multiple studies show **a 100x higher** suicide rate with ""hospitalization"".

**JAMA psychiatry:**

- ""Findings: In this meta-analysis of 100 studies of 183 patient samples, the postdischarge suicide rate was approximately 100 times the global suicide rate during the first 3 months after discharge and patients admitted with suicidal thoughts or behaviors had rates near 200 times the global rate. Even many years after discharge, previous psychiatric inpatients have suicide rates that are approximately 30 times higher than typical global rates.""

120,"So about a year ago I (20M) met some new friends during the first week of my sophomore year of college. Turns out they love smoking weed and I started to hang out with them every day for hours in between classes, on the weekends, etc. They had been smoking daily for a little while already but I had not had those habits yet. First week of September 2018 is when I started smoking weed at least once daily. It was great and really fun for the longest time smoking weed with my new buddies and playing PC games (which i was new to at the time) and playing virtual reality (genuinely mind blowing). But I’ve started to notice some changes in myself around March of 2019. I started to lose interest in anything social. I could easily stay in my room all day smoking week and doing shit on my PC for days at a time. 


Well during the summer of 2019 after sophomore year, I moved back home with my parents and younger siblings and got a job but all I did was work, smoke weed, and play on my PC. There are lots of old friends from high school that would invite me to hang out on week days and weekends but I would either ghost them or come up with a bullshit excuse. I knew it was wrong but I couldn’t find it within me want to go to hang out with other people at all. I lost motivation to do pretty much anything but smoke and game. It’s hard to notice subtle changes over time but who I am now compared to before I started smoking every day are two completely different people socially speaking as well as brain function. I really struggle to hold a conversation with people because there is no common ground between me and my lifestyle and everyone else’s that I know. Conversations were always so forced and fake and I know it’s my fault for basically becoming a degenerate and not being a relatable person (no getting around that, the truth is the truth even if it’s painful).

It’s hard to see brain function issues when it is your own reality all the time but when I really tried to reflect on how I used to be before weed and who i am now, the differences are quite drastic. I decided yesterday, 8-28-19, that I am so fed up with the person I have become. I literally am a leech on other people’s resources, I’m not motivated to do any sort of upkeep for my life’s own sake or for other people’s sake. I have become a master at dodging expectations and it’s not who I want to be nor am I on the path I want my life to go. So yesterday is the first day in I can’t remember how long, I didn’t smoke weed, and I won’t be today either. I need a long break from it. Here is a short list of things that I have noticed have taken a toll from smoking weed every day (in other words, things I’ve have noticed that have changed since I started smoking weed every day):

-my appetite is gone, if I don’t smoke weed, I don’t get hungry and therefore don’t eat. I’ve lost 20 lbs over one year due to the fact that I only eat in the evenings when i smoke and am hungry. I am at my 7th grade weight right now and look incredibly skinny and just unwell in general. My family and friends have made comments about how skinny i have gotten and that i need to keep weight on to be healthy but it was all in one ear and out the other. My theory is that my grehlin hormonal (hunger hormone) levels are fucked from smoking weed all the time. No grehlin, no hunger. Just a theory, I haven’t done any research on this yet related to daily weed smoking.

-my social skills have become shit. I can’t talk to people anymore because I am so out of touch with current events and real life hobbies and activities. When I talk to someone, I have literally nothing to contribute to the conversation because I have nothing substantial to add to it because all I do is smoke weed and play games. I wonder if my Broca’s area (responsible for speech production) in my brain is being affected by weed to the point that I can no longer produce meaningful thoughts to a conversation. 

-my work ethic has taking a big hit too, I have become so fucking lazy, I procrastinate much worse than I did before. I have real responsibilities this school year where many people are depending on me to do a job, even knowing that I can’t find the motivation to just get the job done well.

-I’m a 20 year old male and basically asexual. I am not attracted to guys or girls, I have no interest in relationships whether it be sexual or romantic, whatever it may be. Now I have looked into this a little and found that chronic THC use can lower testosterone levels. How much this is true, I can’t confirm but it would explain the lack of lust most other young guys have at my age. 

-With very subtle and gradual decay, my brain is simply fried a little bit at this point. I just feel dull mentally meaning I feel like I have repressed brain function. Think of it like a constant mental fog. I’m not passionate about anything, I just do what I want when I want and whatever feels best or is appealing to me at the time is what I do. 

I have an addictive personality, which I’m sad to admit. Nicotine user since junior year of high school. Daily weed smoker. I would drink 3-4 times a week freshman year of college. Just bad stuff and I kick myself for it because I know the addictive side of myself and my family yet i still have fallen victim to it.

I am considering getting therapy to help me walk through the process of getting back to where I was before, but I don’t want to let my parents down for being truly irresponsible with the control of my life that i have. Keep in mind I’ve never had therapy for anything before. My barriers to getting therapy:

-I’m the oldest of 3 siblings and I really want to be a role model but if my family knew how bad I’ve gotten, i would be so disappointed for letting them down and I don’t want my younger sisters to know they have a washed up brother.

-I don’t want to pay big bucks out of pocket for a therapist when I think i have a decent idea of what I need to do on my own to get back to where I was (I’ll touch on that later). I’m on my parents insurance and I’m not sure what kind of coverage we get for mental health stuff but honestly I’m too afraid to ask at this point. 

-I know having mental health issues happens to a lot of people but I’ve brought this upon myself and therefore feel shitty for needing to spend my money or my parents money to get therapy for issues I caused for myself. 

SO.......... as of last night, I’ve decided to get my shit together. No smoking weed until i feel better about where I’m at in my life, limiting the time I spend on my PC, doing a fucking great job at the things other people rely on me for, getting my responsibilities done in advance and not last minute. I have access to a nice gym for free with tuition costs so i would like to start doing that but I’m worried my motivation for that will be non-existent. My body’s chemical and hormonal levels are out of wack right now, and I need to give my body some time to reach normal levels again. I want my old life back before chronic weed use. I used to be so much more dimensional and (in my opinion) interesting as a person but I’ve lost that and i can feel it in my brain.

Now this whole thing makes weed look bad but I want to clarify it’s not weed causing the issues, it’s my irresponsible use of weed. Too much of anything is bad. And that’s where I found myself with too much weed consumption. It’s infuriating because i know I’m smarter than letting myself get to this point but everyone has their shortcomings and this is my most annoying one yet in my 20 years of life. 

I’ve toiled with the idea that I may be depressed but honestly it’s not that my life lacks happiness or anything, I just think chronic weed use has similar side effects/symptoms to depression. I don’t have suicidal thoughts, I don’t feel empty or hopeless, sleeping isn’t an issues cuz weed. On the contrary, the symptoms of depression that I DO have:

-loss of interest of pleasure in activities I once enjoyed
-weight loss even when not on a specific diet
-decrease in appetite
-being overly tired throughout the day
-feeling slowed down
-loss of energy
-feelings of guilt (not necessarily worthlessness though)
-difficultly with decision making/lack of concentration


I’d love to hear if anyone has any input, advice, comments, experience, treatment methods that have worked for them or know that can be helpful for someone like me. Also, I’d love any input on working out and getting motivation to create a habit of working out. I don’t know who to tell about my new journey of becoming a contributing member of society so I wanted to it all “on paper” here. If you have other questions, I’d be happy to answer. I’m just looking to get well again and be back to my social happy self. 

Thank you for reading my story :)",29Aug2019,1
121,"(Based on a real story happening to me right now in the moment of writing this post) 

00:10 am.

- Go to bed, darling! -  opening my room's door with speed of light, mom shouted to me again in third or fourth time. There wasn't a second she went back to the kitchen.
 My answer was nothing. I thought If I only open my mouth to say something, I'll be crying out the room. So I kept calm and quiet. She didn't know what I was so dissapointed about.

She shouted again. No answer. She lost all the patience and took my phone when came close. 

-Are you numb, or deaf or something? 

She never finds time to talk to me personally. 

0:18

I'm still looking on the screen of the phone. I returned it back. It was easy, I Just had to pretend I listened to her. I did not. 

The picture. This is what makes me cry. A mix of bites. So ridiculous. 

0:23 Sent my photos to all friends online. Asked them a little question. They promised me a honest answer. I've got a lot of messages, had never gotten so much when a chat is ordinary. Strange...

Here are 5 random messages:

1) Don't be obsessed! You're still pretty in your soul! 
2)Adore yourself. No matter what the other say
3) (three happy emojis) 
4) I love you for your kindness, not the face
5) Everyone's different

Those words... Do not help me at all. They just make me more sure in my ugliness.

My friends are literally the best, so they tried to not spoil my mood, so they found how to tell me the thruth, but in a more ""positive"" way... 

0:27 I turn the lights on and made a selfie. No makeup. Just the real me. Once again. I make 5 selfie shots and started to stare at them. Before I hoped it was sunlight that makes me look so bad.

Guuuush... Is this even me? Do people really see me LIKE THAT?
 I wish I once could erase my face and put new instead. Become flawless. Forever.

I wish I would look at my photos as it's someone else's and not mine, and laugh out loud saying how awkward this girl is.

0:38

I am crying. Want to sleep, but how do I do it? I'm so much in thoughts. Appearance is main, so why was I so unlucky? Can't stop dropping tears on the bed.

0:43 Billie Eilish... Ariana Grande... Camilla, Bebe Rexha, Rihanna, Beyonce... They look so flawless. I'm ashamed of my jealousy to them, but I don't know what to do.

0:44 no tears left to cry. Extreme fatigue. I'm lying in bed. Those model, fashion girls, I now only want to murder all of them. Shouldn't ever think about it. But can't stop. They were born pretty. Me was not.

0:51 It's too late. I'm gonna wake up at 8:00 am and do some routing things. I'll be spending hours again to do makeup and brush my hair in a good way. Do everything just to look a bit less ugly than I am. Makeup is a lie. But it has to be.",29Aug2019,1
122,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember but only really addressed it a year or two ago while in university. In my final year, I broke down and came so so close to ending everything but thankfully my uncle brought me back to my hometown where I could focus on getting well. 

I’m still not okay though. I’ve sought medical help but my doctor just seems to want to up my meds and not deal with me. I went to a mental health centre and called a crisis hotline but all they did was put me on a waiting list (which I’ve been on for 9 months). I’ve tried focusing on myself and working towards being happier but nothing is working. 

It doesn’t help that I’m struggling financially so I had to move in with my grandparents. But my mother and stepdad are buying their house from them so their living there until the other house is built. My aunt And uncle are also living in the same house because they are building my grandparents new home so that it’s attached to theirs. So all in all, there are 7 people living in this house, 3 cats and 2 yappy dogs that aren’t disciplined at all. It’s like sensory overload. I can’t even eat supper with everyone without having an anxiety attack. I would move in with my dad but he’s an alcoholic and is extremely manipulative. 

My mother is the major cause of my stress while I’m living there. She completely dismisses my feelings and tells me that they are imagined. She has zero respect for my feelings or even my belongings. I constantly feel like I’m a burden because she drills it into my head that she gave up her entire life to raise me and I should be more grateful to her. I try to approach her in a non-accusing way because she takes everything as a personal attack but she still refuses to accept that she has done anything wrong or needs to change in any way. She gets mad at me when I’m on my medication because she says I should just “power through” and that “everyone gets stressed.” She tells me that I’m selfish all the time and is constantly critical of everything I do or say. I’m not even allowed to keep a toothbrush in the bathroom because I’m “making a mess.” If I don’t want to talk about something she pushes me until I snap. Even if I just say I can’t talk about it right now. She tells me I can’t ask for help from my other family members for anything because she says she doesn’t want to inconvenience them. But then she tells me I’m not trying to “fix” myself and that I know how to get better and I’m just not doing anything. She also is very passive aggressive. She’s on my constantly about my weight. At dinner she makes comments in front of everyone and makes me feel like absolute garbage and will make me get my food before her so she can watch how much I get. If I have a panic attack she yells at me to “stop that foolishness” and “why are you like this.” 

I really want to leave that house because I don’t think I’ll survive if I stay but I honestly can’t afford to even buy my own medication let alone move out.  I’ve finished my degree but I’m working at a grocery store that barely gives me 8 hours a week and it’s such a small town that if they don’t know your family people won’t hire you. I’ve tried and tried to get another job or an additional one to save up to leave but I just feel so trapped. 

I have some really supportive friends but they’re provinces away and the friends that I have near me aren’t really good friends but they’re all I have. They make me feel like shit about myself and like I’m this awful person who’s too sensitive about things. I try to talk to them but they just tell me I need a boyfriend so I can talk to him instead. 

I made a lot of progress with my self esteem at first but being home has completely crushed it and I have zero confidence in myself anymore. I hate the town I live in and I harbour a lot of resentment towards my parents. At this point it just feels like a matter of time before I die. I feel very alone and although my good friends will always listen and support me, I feel like I’m unloading all of my negativity on them and they’re sick of me. 

It’s also generally difficult for me to message them that I’m not okay. We have terrible dark humour so it often comes out like that and they don’t realize how serious I am. I have trouble bringing it up and most of the time I don’t have the energy to even explain how I feel.  If I do bring things up, I end up convincing myself that I’m overreacting so it builds until I’m at a crisis point. 

Sorry to like go completely off but this is the first time I’m reaching out on something like this. I’d really appreciate any sort of advice or encouraging words. I feel like I’m screaming for attention but I just don’t know what to do anymore.",29Aug2019,1
123,"I don’t even know what to do anymore. I’m so sick of living the way I do- working two jobs, living with shitty roommates, socially isolating myself because no one understands or tries to understand how I’m feeling. I’m so tired! I’m just so tired of waking up in the morning and working 8 hour shifts at two jobs and then coming home to sleep and do it all over again. I’m so tired of my parents just laughing it off as teenage drama or normal stress (it’s not normal stress- I’m 19 and I don’t live with them but I can barely make ends meet). I’m so tired of feeling like a failure when all I ever do is bust my ass for everything and everyone. I’m so tired of feeling like I just want to fucking lose my mind. Like being locked up somewhere is so much easier. I’m off my meds because I don’t even care enough to take them anymore and my doctors fucked them up. I’m so done. I’m so fucking done.",29Aug2019,1
124,"I am having a moment of clarity, and I guess for now I feel relieved because I dont need to go sign up to a therapist, I dont need to speak to my GP. I am going to remain suicidal whether I get therapy or not because they dont speak to me on the correct level.

All the mental health services I have ever been to are focused around getting you back into the machine and they dont care about you or your problems. I beleive the people in them want to help, but at best they are ignorant to the elitism, corruption and general unfairness of the current socio-economic system, at worst, well they dont care or are complicit and become part of the problem that is driving my depression and feelings of hopelessness. From that perspective maybe I should have realised sooner just how inconsequential and asinine their exercises and their psychobabble was, and how it will not help me get better.

125,"I have booked my counseling session but its 3 weeks away.  I used to go to counseling 2 years ago, which helped.  However right now I need help.  So quick back story, I've had anxiety and depression since I could ever remember.  Even as a 5 year old I remember awful thoughts and feelings.  Over the years I've managed to find ways to cope with the constant struggle.  I'm what you would call a high functioning anxious and depressive human.  I look fine.  People believe I'm fine.  I'm open about my mental health struggles.. well most of it.  The one aspect I don't tell anyone, except my boyfriend (6.5 years he sees me go through a lot), is that I'm suicidal.   I've been suicidal since I was 13 and have attempted once at 15 years old (handful of sleeping pill, made me hallucinate rather than kill me).  Things are getting really bad again.  My suicidal thoughts are getting bigger and louder.  I was over an hour late for work this morning because I had my 2nd ever panic attack I think.  Hyperventilating, hysterically crying and screaming.  It took almost an hour to calm down.  And all I could think was to kill myself so this pain would stop.  Can you tell me what the difference is between anxiety attack vs panic attack? All I know is I am not fine nor ok, I want to isolate myself and self medicate.  I want to just not exist anymore.  I don't want to die per say but I don't want to exist.  I'm so, so tired of fighting.  I think about driving off the bridge on my way into work...

126,"I am afraid i might be dangerous for the people around me(now). I am 23 years old, and i have been coping with all this hell since i was 3 years old, thanks to a trauma we had (yes, we).I remember every detail of my life from that early age. It all started when, the real persona created me, i am another personality of hers created to help her cope with the trauma.
The thing is, my symptoms became worse.. we used to hear voices, see things, feel things, and we were aware of what is real and what is not, to live with them. But now it is so hard to even make the difference between THEM and the real world. Sometimes i found myself doing things that i am not supposed to, due to an episode. And i get this feeling of survival like i am some wounded animal (i control myself) , but i am afraid one day i will not be able to be in control anymore... and i would hurt the ones i love. I am grateful my s.o. started being supportive, even though he is not an empathetic person. 

As for medicines, we used to take some pills when we were little(they were for depression),but now she won’t let me go to a psychiatrist, she is afraid they gonna send us to a mental health institute or something.

131,"Hey guys, first time posting here so I'm a little nervous. 

TW ⚠ Suicide, depression

I've had MH issues since I was 4 years old (I'm 29F). I remember having this irrational fear that my Mother would leave me to the point I'd scream and cry hysterically whenever she left me with my Father. At 16 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety after several (thankfully failed) suicide attempts. Then at 19 I sadly lost a baby and attempted to take my own life a further 4 more times, my now ex partner got me a dog (she's 10 now) and honestly, she saved my life because I stopped trying and by following self help guides I managed to pull myself up. 

7 years later, I was a qualified therapist specialising with teenage mental health which I had to step back from after having a severe breakdown at the back end of 2014 which ended up wiry me being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

And here I am today, 
I still don't work because I triggered agoraphobia within myself (I haven't been outside by myself in 4 years and I can barely leave my house with the support of my partner. I probably manage once every 2-3 months to get out for an hour. I don't socialise with anyone really because of this overwhelming fear of being a burden and my family aren't exactly close. 

During work, I remember how overwhelming it was to see how many people needed help and knowing how long waiting lists were, broke my heart - yet now I'm on the other side of the table - waiting 4 years to get help, to be passed from one organisation to the other, never getting help from any of them.. It's hard to not feel like you're being ignored, or left behind or that there's no one on your side. 

The sad fact is, the MH system is stretched. It's only really been this past 10-15 years that MH stopped being that ""hippie shit"" or a taboo. Naturally they're struggling with the demand. 

I guess I just wanted to reach out and vent a little? I'm not sure.. I'm sorry if this all seems a bit all over. I really struggle putting my feelings into text haha 

I just want to remind you that you're not alone, and even if you don't have a therapist because you're on a waiting list - they're thinking about you more than you know. I still think about the people I never got to see or cancelled appointments. We're here together and that can never be taken away from us. 

Hold on. No matter how hard it gets, keep getting back up, keep asking for help, keep talking to anyone who'll listen, keep listening, keep loving yourself.

133,"I stopped taking hormonal birth control three months ago and my spouse and I have since been trying for a baby. I have a history (past and present) of anxiety, but I've never experienced intrusive or suicidal thoughts until now. Part of it seems to be the pressure of trying to get pregnant while getting my Ph.D. and about to travel abroad by myself for 3 months. But I'm not convinced that my mental health issues are so connected to these external stressors alone. I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of an overwhelming ocean of tears and I'm hoping that some of you can relate. 

Since I've never experienced these slightly intrusive thoughts before, I don't know how serious I need to take them. I can't tell if its mood swings or something that I should try to get professional help for.

When I entered college, I felt that I could turn it around, because finally I was going to study what I was interested in. However, the habit of procrastination kept on increasing and I haven't been able to do all that I had dreamed of accomplishing in college. It isn't that I am burdened by other's expectation, they are just my expectations. As a result, a lot of guilt has built up, and I recently came to the realisation that I longer feel good about anything. Whether it's playing games, eating out or general socialising, everything is accompanied by a guilt of what I could have done. The guilt in me has utterly destroyed my motivation.

135,"I married the love of my life over two years ago here in Benghazi, Libya. He’s Syrian and I’m American. He and his family live here in Libya due to war in their country and the only way for us to be together was fo me to come here. I knew this was going to require a lot of sacrifice but I didn’t imagine it would be this hard from every aspect. We are near the end of our super complicated visa procedure, but everything just seems to keep going wrong. I never imagined we’d still be stuck here. 

Our life is on hold. It’s not safe here. I do not have equal rights in this country. The electricity goes out daily. I am not allowed to drive or work. I must dress a specific way. I cannot go into many cafes, shops and businesses because I am a woman. There is minimal to no real healthcare and I have several major issues that can’t seem to be resolved. They also do not believe in psychology or mental health and even though my husband is super open minded, even he has problems trying to understand how I’m feeling. I’m unable to make friends here due to safety concerns and cannot actually leave the house often either. I’ve gained a lot of weight just sitting around all the time. The only slight fun thing I can do is learn to cook yummy food and bake, and that’s not helping anything. 

Growing up American, this is not a lifestyle I’m used too and I’ve adapted a bunch and I’m not sure how much more I can handle. I’ve worked since age 14 and was a rather independent woman up until now at age 24. My mental status is hurting my marriage. I feel like giving up. I love my husband to death and I would never say I regret this, but it’s been the most difficult thing I’ve ever been through and my closest friend at home and mother do not understand nor do they bother to try, to support or comfort me. 

I need help, advice or suggestions on how to make it better until we can get out of here. How can I pull myself out of this depression? Looking and focusing on our love and a few other positives just isn’t working anymore.

136,"Personally I love horror movies, true crime shows, dramas, sad rock music, philosophy and psychology. I often fall into nostalgia and deep thought and make things worse for myself and my depression/anxiety but I can't help it! Makes me wonder if I like these things cause I'm depressed and I relate to a drama rather a comedy movie, or if these are the things that are actually making me more depressed in the first place.

I'm also a writer and I enjoy writing tragedies despite the fact that they're emotionally draining. But it wouldn't be me if I didn't insert a certain melancholy into each of my works. It's the same in everyday life - I always search for the ""beautiful tragedy"" in everything. I guess I romanticize things that I shouldn't but how do I stop?

137,"Hi, I have a female friend who I care a great deal for. She was sexually abused as a little girl so as a result she has I'd say severe body dysmorphia. She has what'd say is almost a self hatred as she has convinced herself that she is 'ugly and trash'. Along with that she has a severe anxiety around people and alot more. It breaks my heart to hear her say those things because honestly she's anything but, but no matter what I tell her she refused to believe anything else. We've briefly talked about a romantic relationship but in her words she feels she can't love someone if she doesn't love herself, which to me weighs on me heavily because I honestly love her. But apart from that I sincerely want her to be able to live her best life which I feel she'll hinder herself from if she continues this way. I encourage her to get help but she seems to feel that it won't work or that it'll be sad and they won't understand.

139,"I don't know what is going on.

Lately I've been texting a few guys who actually make efforts, ask a bunch of question, want to hang out, and are really sweet to me. But I feel so uncomfortable..

I've had 3 major crushes in the past two years. When I would text them, I would make efforts, try to hang out, etc., but the guy was always pretty cold and wouldn't make efforts back. 

So now when I'm texting those sweet guys, I feel like I'm talking to myself, and I am one of my crushes. It feels awful, to see myself from another point of view. I am crying right now, because I know I deserve to be treated nicely, but at the same time I don't, I don't know what's wrong with me. As if I'm purposly trying to get hurt by texting guys who make me feel like sh\*t, and once a nice guy wants to talk to me, I start feeling weird because I see myself, and I feel as though I'm not deserving of this kind of attention.

It's so weird how I actually talk about myself to them, I would never do that, at least not in depth, with my past crushes, I would only listen to them. I'm afraid I'll hurt those guys, by becoming one my of my crushes, and making them feel the same they made me feel, so I try to be extra nice and make efforts as well but I don't know what to think of anything, I feel awful I feel awful",29Aug2019,1
140,"This might sound ramble-y because I haven’t really prepared a way to say this beforehand, but here I go. I’ve been dealing with mental health problems my whole life, but it only really because visible when I turned 11. By 12, I had started my first medication, and I’ve been on countless since then. Recently, although my new medicine helped for a little bit, I’m losing my motivation again. I’m homeschooled, but I rarely do my work. I’m addicted to my phone. I sleep 12 hours at a time. This all sucks and I’m self aware too, but I can’t seem to bring myself to do otherwise.

My mom has talked about putting me in a hospital, but I really really don’t want to go. My cousin has been in and out of hospitals since she was 13, and she got out for the last time at 17, and I don’t want that to happen to me, even though our circumstances are different. The closest hospital, and the one that’s been discussed by my mom and therapist is a really bad one, and I’ve only heard bad things about it, so I really don’t want to go.

Well, I think I’ve hit a point where she would want to put me in inpatient care. My depression and anxiety are reaching a bad point, and my sensory issues are getting worse and worse, and I’ve been stimming a lot more. The big thing that I think would push me over to a hospital, is my skin picking. I went a while without it, but I’ve started up again. It was on my face only for a while (and I have scars from it), but now it has moved to my fingers. I have a sore on the side of my pointer finger (the side towards my thumb) that is.. really bad, to say the least. It’s not painful, but it looks like it would be. I wasn’t able to hide it from my mom because of how visible it is, so I made up a shitty excuse. Now she thinks it’s an infected spider bite that broke open and left a open sore the size of a dime. That’s not what happened, but I don’t want my mom to know that it’s self inflicted. (Although I say “self inflicted”, I don’t consider it self harm because I pick subconsciously and only notice when it’s too late and I have blood running down my face, or in this case a big sore on the side of my finger.)

I really don’t know what I’m gaining from typing all this on a subreddit, other than getting it out semi-anonymously. I’m really sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit for this.",29Aug2019,1
141,"My mother keeps telling me I need counseling and a lot of people online are saying something similar. I kind of understand where they're coming from, but I'm honestly happier right now than I have been in a long time. I've struggled with depression and anxiety on and off for about five years, but I'm currently on some ""happy pills"" that work very well and haven't had an episode since I started them.

The base of her argument is that I don't go out very often and don't talk to anyone other than her and my dad. I'm in (community) college, but I'm not taking any classes this semester. I had a job earlier this year but I had to quit because it was taking a serious toll on my sanity and I've been applying around all summer. I've finally found somewhere willing to hire me, so I'll be working again soon. I was extremely unpopular in high school (to the point where people didn't want to be seen with me), so I didn't exactly have a lot of friends, but I had enough. I struggled to come to terms with not being as popular as I wanted for years. When I was little, I always wanted high school to be like Grease or something, but it never turned out that way. It was like a big gray cloud hanging over me for awhile, but I've come to realize that I don't *need* anyone but myself. And I don't mean to sound narcissistic in saying that, I just think it's healthy to be able to enjoy your own company. I shouldn't need other people's approval to be happy, right?

I've hung out with my friends a couple of times over the summer while they've been home from college, but I didn't feel the need to see them every day or even every week like my mom assumed I would. I'm just not lonely anymore! I've overcome that desperate need to be liked, but somehow she sees that as a bad thing. Isn't knowing how to enjoy my own company a good thing? I don't know if it was the medication or just the long period of separation, but I've learned how to be alone. But my mom says I'm ""pushing people away because I don't want to risk getting close to the wrong person again.""

To be fair, I've done that plenty of times. At least four of my very close friends have all turned against me and made various attempts to essentially ruin my life. I'm also guilty of getting way to attached to and trying way to hard to be friends with people who wouldn't piss on my face to put out a fire. I guess I'm naive like that. I like to think the best of people and ignore their flaws. My bad experiences certainly influenced my current philosophy, but I don't see that as a bad thing. I've learned from my mistakes and freed myself from the shackles of pandering. I like myself and that's all that should matter. Having friends is nice and all, but I certainly don't rely on them for my self image or happiness anymore. To carry this to its logical extreme, if I never see another human being again, I'll be just fine. I have myself! I don't need anyone else!

My mom says various other things about my ""lack of self confidence"" and ""lack of ambition,"" but that really deserves its own post. What are your thoughts, sub? Am I in denial or is my mom just worried over nothing?

Note: I posted almost this exact thing last night, but I accidentally deleted it before getting any really helpful responses.",29Aug2019,1

143,"I've had very on and off depression for a long time. Since my teenage years it has vastly improved but lately I've been very lonely due to many friends moving away or moving on in life, and me being left behind. This has caused my depression to start coming back up on more days than it did before, and this is the first time in a months I've considered getting medication for it.

I still feel fine on some days. If I stay busy by picking up more hours at work I feel fine whilst distracted, but this just causes me to crash physically and mentally even harder later on. I've noticed that sometimes I'll have full days of depression, on my days off work, where I just feel like everything is shutting down physically and mentally because it all needs to rest. I also feel better when I regularly exercise and meditate, but I find it hard to keep good habits going, especially when I have to do those habits to get out of a depression episode. If I'm working more, this makes it even harder to do these things because I have less time and I'm more tired.

University starts back up in a little over two weeks for me and I don't want to be a dysfunctional mess for my honours degree year, but I am reluctant to rely on drugs. I have some history with ecstasy and I've done lsd once. I know they're definitely not antidepressants or very safe drugs but I don't think they did me any good and I'm reluctant to alter my brain with more drugs, or to rely on a substance to make me feel better. At the same time I don't know if I'll ever fully escape depression on my own. Life never really stops long enough for me to just take my time with building up healthy habbits for good mental health, but trying to build them up while depressed can be so hard sometimes.

However, I also have pretty bad OCD, which the low dose naturally did not help. So my doctor has now raised my dosage from 5 mg to 20 mg, but not at once of course. I’ve currently graduated from 5 mg to 10 mg, and I’ve been feeling a little depressed and fatigued.

154,"I don't know if this is serious enough to call a mental health issue but it's been a struggle and I just needed to post this somewhere. 

The past couple of months my mind has been finding its way to thinking about dying. This has been happening every night really, especially when I'm alone. The main things which affect me are:

- The thought of not being able to be with my girlfriend. We've been together a few years and the thought of not being with her near cripples me with fear. 

- The fear of not being. I'm not religious, I'm an atheist, and I would give anything to be religious, I've been trying to tell myself that it's possible that there is something after, but it doesn't work. 

Sometimes I feel like I can ground myself by thinking about the fact that I'm only 20 and I've barely scratched the surface of how much time I've spent on this planet, let alone time with my girlfriend. And also sometimes thinking about the fact that maybe when I die I will have accepted it by then and be at peace.

My immediate thought was to talk to my girlfriend about this (I have a little which helped a lot) but I don't want to keep bringing it up, just because she suffers from anxiety and is going through a ton lately and I don't want to trigger something that will make her have this issue too.

Finally I just want to add this isn't affecting my day to day life really, it happens for a couple hours before I go to sleep, and it doesn't prevent me from leaving the house or anything like that, I just think slowly if I don't sort this it could eat away at my sanity.

It hasn't always been like this, but within the past few months to a year, I've just felt so numb. I'll act happy or sad not because that's what I feel, but because it feels like it's the appropriate thing to do. I feel so neutral to everything, with the exceptions of just a few moments. It's like being bored, minus the drive to do something.

I don't want to sound like some kind of serial killer origin story, I just want to open these emotional floodgates and just *feel* something.

167,"I need some help deciding if finding help will help me or if this will just go away or not. It’s been 1,5 months now. TL;DR will be at the bottom!

I recently got a new job, purchased my dream car and was super happy. It’s a sports car but I’m a very safe driver. I keep my distance, don’t speed and especially do not touch my phone in the car. 

3 weeks into driving it I got into a pretty serious car accident. A traffic jam was clearing and the lady behind me had taken medication that had caused her to fall asleep, with her foot on the gas pedal. I was going 50km/h, and by the footage later recovered and the damage to my car and hers it was estimated she was going about 120km/h at the moment of impact. I somehow managed to neatly park my car on the side of the road, the impact looked next to nothing. I was in shock and found it hard to think thanks to the headache. When I noticed my phone was missing from the phone holder on my dashboard the panic kicked in. It was nowhere to be found. The only thing I could think to do was to get out of the car and flag someone to stop. For 15 mins I stood there waving and crying. Halway in I noticed I was also covered in blood from the seatbelt that had cut into my body. A trucker honked at me but didn’t stop. Nobody stopped. The lady who hit me was a good 100m away from me, standing next to her car. Finally someone stopped and offered his phone. The only number I could remember was my parent’s home number and luckily my dad picked up. He called my bf  who was apparently quite unimpressed. I asked him if he would come to me because I was confused and the short answer was no, it was too much hastle and I should either drive to an easier spot or call a tow car. At this point still nobody had called the police or an ambulance and I was too confused to even come up with that idea. Out of nowhere a tow car appeared, apparently there’s camera’s along the road with people monitoring. Would have been nice if they called the police, but no. The tow guy told me with that ‘small dent’ I could just follow him and we’d get the forms filled in at the mechanic. He didn’t care about my seatbelt being stuck. I got in the car and couldn’t even figure out how to drive anymore. When I took too long the tow car came to me to check if it was broken so I told him I couldn’t drive. When I went to grab my bag to leave the car with the tow guy I found my phone, behind the chair. I managed to call my bf again and he would come to the mechanic’s place. We drove there and I had to fill in a form with all my details, that I could barely remember. My bf is 15 mins away from the mechanic’s place yet showed up an hour after I arrived there. I was feeling more miserable by the minute at this point. There was no water available and only a barstool to sit on. He spoke to the lady and her husband about contact details and we got in his car. I broke into hysterical crying at this point and threw up. We drove to the hospital where I had to stay the night. I bruised my ribs, collarbone and had a concussion. I saw visions of the impact all night and this lasted for a day or 2.

I started driving again 2 weeks later and it was okay, traffic was also super low due to summer holidays. Traffic is getting worse and I have been having small panic attacks every time someone drives up to me fast from behind. The worst one made me feel dizzy. I also have frequent nightmares about being in trouble and not finding help anywhere, almost every night.

She said the owners would give it CBD oil for its anxiety because it would bark at the blender every time it was on. But it had THC in it so it was stoned all the time. She said the dog was dumb and she hated it, maybe that she wanted to kick it. She said the dog was a burden. She asked me what I thought of that. She would say this in front of Q while he smirked. 

If you could understand this, she is using the dog to represent me being high all the time because I am. I jump at loud noises and I always have. In her narrative I am the stoned dog jumping at the blender and I should be kicked.

There are so many other narratives I can’t keep track. I’ll admit I’m not very smart, I honestly can’t help it and it’s not like I haven’t tried. 

For example she once sent me a super intimate photo montage of them and there was one with his dick out. Then she was like oops, don’t watch that. 

Or texts like “ I’m so tiny, the doors are hard for me to open in Europe” because they had gone to Europe together but he invited all of our friends too. 

For a while I thought that we were all in love with each other but I was too immature but now I see that it was just taunting. 

She has implied many times that she was somehow involved in writing Taylor Swift’s songs. Which is really weird because her new album came out recently and there’s a song called Paper Rings. My high school boyfriend carved me a promise ring out of paper material and I told her about that. 

Another lyric where she says she hates accidents. A friend had mentioned once in front of  Q  that I like accidents and I was left explaining that I just like light impact and don’t want people to get hurt. I wish I could explain that I wish that I could explain that I wish I could experience this in a vacuum. Time slows down, the feeling is crazy.

They both seem very interested in the movie Under the Silverlake. It seems as though they imply that they had something to do with its production in a big way.

It’s uncanny because there’s a scene where a squirrel drops from a tree ( this happened to me and I told them about it. There’s a lot of sarcastic Nirvana stuff and the dog killer joke which she would reference before the movie came out.

She also told me I was autistic and falsely diagnosed as bipolar.

She showed me her nudes which was weird and Q got super uncomfortable. Like she did it while he was there. She was saying that she looked like a little girl and now I’m thinking is that what he’s into?

He “cuddled” with me and has told me he loves me a few times. He says we can’t go any further and I understand, it’s not like I would enjoy it anyway even with him. Also that it would ruin our friendship.

I had a super traumatic childhood so I guess I’m sexually repressed but I watch porn, and can orgasm so idk.

I don’t think I’m capable or have any interest in being with someone. I don’t think that I love him, I don’t know what that is. 

I have zero people to tell this to in my life. I have no relationships with real depth. I’m pretty depressed I think. I don’t relate to any of my friends.

Anyway, it seems like he taunts me with the information he’s gathered. 

Whenever we hang out, he will look over at me, point through our friends and speak in a voice that is separate from his usual talking voice and quote me, at me. Or sometimes he’ll say things other people have said to me in private. It seems like he knows what I masturbate to, what I think even.

How do I know this is happening? I have made 600+ audio recordings of me either free associating possible jokes for stand up, diary entry like rants and he quotes things I have said to myself in private. Word for word. It’s freaking me out. I can replay the evidence. I can remember things I’ve said.

Recently, he jokingly said a thing and then after “that could be a stand up joke haha” all while looking at me knowingly.

It sucks because I feel like nothing I think nor say is mine anymore. There’s no privacy. I’m already pissed because I live in LA and there are cameras everywhere. On top of this he films us a lot of the time. I go along with it because idk it’s what everyone has always done.

It’s the worst because he’s my favorite person and I don’t want him hearing every stupid weird thing I say, do or experience. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel hopeless. I feel like shit. What do I do? Sorry if none of this is cohesive.",29Aug2019,1
173,"So i have severe emotional issues that all point to depression. i can’t be open with my family about it because i don’t trust them and they are part of the reason to begin with. they would talk about it all the time and be mad about it if i tried to tell them. i’m a senior in high school and i’m not 18 yet so i don’t know if i can get help without them. i have a lot of suicidal thoughts but never act on them. i degrade myself a lot and blame myself for everything and i am aware it’s bad but i can’t stop myself. i’m autistic so that causes a lot of social problems to begin with, but i’ve lost most of my friendships and my girlfriend because of how degrading i am on myself and how extreme my emotions get. how do i get help for this. i’m miserable and it’s all just building up i want to get rid of it all",29Aug2019,1
174,"I’m not sure which page to post this too, but since I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression and I’ve only had these sleep issues recently then it’s probably appropriate to post on here. 

So it’s happened like only a couple of times. I have no idea whether it’s a dream or Ive actually opened my eyes. But what I see is my exact position in bed and I try and get up but I can’t move. And I struggle to breath almost like I’m holding my breath. And in my head I’m trying so so hard to drag myself up and force myself to wake up but I’m completely stuck. It only happens for a few seconds and afterwards makes me really uncomfortable and sweaty/hot. 

Does anyone know why this happens? Because it’s making me a bit scared to fall asleep/wake up.",29Aug2019,2
175,"I’ve tried fighting my anxiety and depression for over a decade, and I just can’t anymore. I look around and all I see are signs that I’m useless. A room that hasn’t been cleaned up in months, because “I’m just too tired”. Relationships that have disappeared because I can’t bring myself to burden people by talking to them. All I do is sabotage myself and prove that I am useless on a daily basis. I would say that I’m sorry, but that’s done nothing. I’m just worthless. I wish I was dead, at least people around me wouldn’t have to worry about me burdening them any more. I’m pathetic.",29Aug2019,1
176,"I used to be an intelligent kid growing up. Altough a ""loser"" everyone appreciated my intelligence (anyone that mattered at least). I used to be very articulate, funny, full of ideas and very unique thought patterns, that would shine out from others when I vocalized them. But for the last few years I feel like my intelligence declined and I'm taking baby steps in social situations and in school. (Never was good with school). The closest friends I had now absolutely despise me. Any relationship I had is broken because of how stupid my brain is now. Social cues and subtle jokes fly over my head, I'm constantly in a deep foggy haze and can barely get my thoughts across. I constantly say things I dont mean and its difficult to converse because I will be constantly asking people to repeat themselves or explain something over and over again like an old grandpa. I cant process information like I used to. I will be left behind in conversations because I cant for the life of me understand what is being said and people will be on a whole different topic by the time I understand what was last said. Because of this I make irrelevent remarks and speak without thoroughly thinking about what I want to say. I have become a lot more shallow as a result of this as well. I dont feel that spark that would get me to dive into deeper topics. It hurts my brain just thinking about basic things and I cant distinguish good and bad information anymore. I'll just believe what somebody tells me and wont change my mind until someone else tells me something that makes more sense. I dont have my own opinions on anything anymore. Its like I forgot how to think. I am very numb to exterior stimulus as well. Somebody can curse me to the ground and yell at me and I will just sit there and take it because I cant even understand the mistakes I make. All these things have caused my closest friends to become very hostile towards me. My reputation has all but dissipated. Nobody respects me and everyone treats me like garbage. I can barely call these people my friends anymore because all they do is curse at me in unspeakable ways. I'm very on edge when I speak because I am afraid I will forget a minute detail and mess up the whole conversation which inevitably happens and I am turned into an absolute garbage of a human being infornt of everyone. When I ask why people treat me the way they do just because I misphrased a word and caused confusion, they say that I do it constantly. So people have no tolerance for my stupidity anymore. Sorry for the wall of text I cant format it since I'm on mobile. Im very lost. What happened to me? Was it the drugs? Was it my shallow friend group I had growing up that influenced me? Or am I having early onset dementia or something? Thanks for any input in advance.",29Aug2019,8
