1,I've missed a lot of opportunities because of my anxiety. It keeps on convincing my head that everything will go wrong and it'll be my all fault. I don't want this anymore.,05Dec2019,1
2,"In early 2019 my mental health was at its worst. I have experienced disorders such as anxiety and depression, but never in my life had an identity crisis and a mental breakdown up until that point. The worst part about it is that it came rather unexpectedly, it was a series of events (Rather not explain them) that occurred at various times that caused this. Not knowing who I was and questioning everything about me and everything was mentally draining to add to it all.  At one point the pressure of constant thoughts and questions caused me to have a mental breakdown.

During my mental breakdown and identity crisis I had no motivation at all. Daily chores and responsibilities soon began to fade as I was too caught up in my head. Unfortunately at the time I still had to attend school which added to the already overwhelming mental chaos. I remember arriving at school and not saying a word to my friends, and not showing any expression at all. Beyond my private life at home, it severely damaged all relationships at the time, even my own family. 

The depression definitely added on to my lack of motivation and interest in daily things. Usually I spend my free time alone but occupying myself with the things I enjoy such as watching football for example. When I had all of these conditions, I literally did nothing. Once I arrived home from school I would just lay in my bed and stare at the ceiling. The only thing I got up to do was eat only a little bit and use the restroom. I was sleep deprived, anxious, depressed, and had no identity. I would stay up countless hours questioning everything about who I thought was me and even reality itself. Eventually those questions led me into delusional thoughts about reality, life, and people.

In conclusion this was the time of absolute mental deterioration for me. Eventually after at least a month or more I finally came back to myself. It was a long and terrible process of recovery, and I honestly wouldn’t wish this on anyone else. Please, if you suspect that you are in or about to go through a identity crisis, then please reach out to someone. I can’t stress how important this is, as it was my mistake of not telling anyone. Look for key symptoms such as questioning who you are and your role in society, not enjoying daily activities, trying to find your “true self”.",05Dec2019,1

4,"Since the start of the year, my mind has felt incredibly sluggish and “out of it”. It feels like a constant pressure on my brain, and my awareness has suffered from it (I’m slow to respond to things, I can’t register some conversations, etc). It’s like being submerged in treacle.

If anyone knows what the hell this is, please tell me. I’m about to start mock exams and I can’t bear to put up with this. Thanks for listening to my ramble :)",05Dec2019,1

Before I begin, I just want to say that I’m not writing this looking for pity, I only hope to inspire and give hope to others. 

About 4 years ago, I felt the world was against me, whilst it may seem cliché and you may be thinking: “we’ve all thought that at one point or another”, you’re right. It didn’t make me special, different or a cause for concern. However I could never shake this feeling, especially after, what seemed like, never ending abuse was thrown at me from all angles. I began to isolate myself, only deepening the overwhelming lonely emotions.

I talked to my sister about it but could only ever manage mentioning the tip of the iceberg. She didn’t need the stress in her life, I’d get through it, I’ll be fine. I always stopped myself telling her the countless problems I faced, no matter how much I wanted to talk about it, I could never find the words, so I said “that’s all, I promise”. It was, in a way. It was the total I could formulate sentences to describe. It was the total I could make sense of in my head. It was the total I felt justified crying about. 

However these unexplainable scratches in my positive mentality grew to wounds I thought could never heal.  I absentmindedly scratched the itches that were the negative thoughts, until my psyche was damaged almost beyond repair. 

As I felt more isolated than ever in a room full of people, I left myself wondering if life was even worth living: who would miss me? I mean my family sure, but I’m just a burden. 

It got to the point I planned it. I’m not going to explain how I planned to, but it happened. I was so numb I no longer cared. So numb to the point I can’t actually recall the few months after that because I was never present. Physically I was there, living life, smiling and meeting up with my friends. 
But mentally: I was dead already. 

Toxic friendships, tragic events, and the realisation I had social anxiety left me feeling useless, worthless. 

All this is over the course of about 2 years. 

During this time I went on a school trip. I left feeling disgusted with myself and dirty. (Whilst I now realise none of this was my fault, at the time I didn’t realise what was going on). Without realising it, someone I knew had sexually assaulted me whilst being encouraged by someone I’d considered a friend at that point. 
Whilst amends have been made, apologies have been given and accepted from the guy, I knew I could never continue my life with that friend, who had encouraged it, in it. Even now I have flashbacks when I’m touched in a certain way on my leg, leaving my heart thudding and often leaving me distant for the next few hours/days. 

Soon after, I cut that friend out. I felt in control of my life for the first time in years. I had been manipulated without realising it, becoming a person I wasn’t, and that had to change.

Little by little I pieced my life back to how I wanted it to be. Believe me, it’s the most difficult thing I’ve ever done, and I continue to do it today, over 4 years later. I have relapsed and dipped into depressive episodes and had more anxiety attacks than I can remember, yet somehow I’ve made it to here.

This last year has been the toughest in a while. GCSEs brought on a depressive episode like no other, once again leaving me suicidal. My health went into decline, I lost weight and hair, I didn’t have a period for nearly 6 months, and I was ill for a large portion of the run up to GCSEs because I was truly exhausted; physically, mentally, and just exhausted of life. 

Yet I powered through. It took almost constant coaching from my amazing set of friends to stop me from breaking down everyday. I spent my time worrying about the revision I should have been doing whilst staring blankly at a wall, finding it impossible to move, let alone study. Yet I somehow powered through it, I set myself a goal. And that was what I needed. Whilst it was never a big goal, it was one that seemed almost impossible at the time: read, take notes on, and test myself on one topic of one subject. That was all I set myself up to do. Meet the goal. Then reset the same goal, repeat. 

My dad once said to me that when he cycles up challenging hills, he just tries to get 5m up the hill, then once he gets there, he goes for the next 5m. He said “if I could go the first 5m, then why can’t I do it again? I just did it. So whilst it may hurt my muscles, I know I’m capable.” 

At first, I didn’t understand. Why would he be able to do it again? He’s now tired from going 5m up the hill, so it’s more difficult. But after mulling it over, I realised what he was saying, and now apply it to everything I do. 

Apply yourself, set small, achievable goals, and just channel your energy into meeting and exceeding your goals. 

Sitting and revising, I would then do not one, but two topics. Then three, then four etc. Before I knew it, I would have revised a complete subject. Yes, I was exhausted from the effort, but I was happy in myself that I had exceeded my original goal. 

And it paid off. It truly did. I gained better GCSE results than I could ever have hoped for, and now feel confident in my ability to set my own course in life. 

Using this mentality, I have gained self confidence, allowing myself to approach new people, without a safety net, despite my anxiety. If I can talk to one person, why not two? Three? Sure my heart is beating out of my chest, but to be honest, what’s the worst that could happen? 

Whenever anyone asks what your biggest achievement is, you may say “passing GCSEs” or “climbing the three peaks”. 
But mine? It’s not something you can see on paper, record through photos or write on a CV. My biggest achievement is being here. Living. Truly living. To do that you have to be immersed in the moment. 

It seems difficult, and it is no walk in the park, but live in the present. Why think where else you could be when you’re where you are? The world is full of positive contributions to your day. Be mindful, don’t let your mind wander to wherever is better than where you are, think about how much opportunity there is all around you. Not only will it make your day better, but days make up weeks, which makes months, which makes years, which makes a better life. 

I guess the purpose of this is to inspire those who are struggling right now, let them know you can make it through, and prosper, despite the adversity and challenges you face.

Okay time for entry number 2. 
I’m not going to lie, I didn’t think I’d write another entry. I thought about it a few times, writing about the positive things in my life, but somehow I think those things are best enjoyed in the moment and I struggle to write about them in a way that isn’t a bullet list. But back on track, time for life shock story number 2. 
In my last entry I wrote about being exhausted and skipping periods. Whilst yes, that is a side effect of stress, the loss of hair, fatigue and irregular periods are also symptoms of the syndrome I have recently been diagnosed with: polycystic ovarian syndrome (or PCOS as it’s more commonly known). 
After tests and doctors appointments and more tests, I have gotten my answer. My incurable answer. The answer which has told me I am likely to struggle getting pregnant and staying pregnant. That causes me to gain weight and struggle to lose it. That has made me lactose intolerant. That has just generally made me feel like shit. 
Okay yes I got an answer, but this was the worse case scenario and it scares me. It genuinely does. I’m sorry but this isn’t an inspiring chapter of my life. I don’t have the energy to inspire. But that’s the problem. That’s why I hate this so much. I feel as though I’m making excuses for myself, blaming PCOS. I should be fine, I’ve gotten on before and I’m still alive, so why start blaming something now? 
I feel weak and unable, but I’m being told I’m fine. Everything is fine. At this point I haven’t told anyone in my family. Yes, they need to know, but I feel like I’m just making excuses, that it’s not justified. I’ve done everything just fine if not better than fine up until now, in their opinions, so why should this change anything? I don’t even know the answer to that one. I’m searching for answers, but finding few. And wanting support but feel like it makes me weak. Now I sound like a fucking sob story, but that’s what I feel like. And I hate it. Yet I don’t know how to change. 
At the time of writing this, only 5 people other than doctors know I have PCOS. I don’t know how to tell people without sounding like I’m looking for sympathy, but I feel so alone.

Recently I’ve been feeling more in control. I’ve been making those who need to aware of my condition and making the relevant adjustments to my schedule to ensure I can still do what I want without being too tired.
I’m not sure why but I’ve also been feeling both dejected and empowered. Recently a couple people I knew committed suicide. And that saddens me to my core, because I’ve been there. I know how it feels. I thought it would never get better and didn’t know what else to do. Yet here I am. I have an amazing boyfriend who loves and supports me, friends who I love and love me no matter how long it is between seeing eachother in our busy schedules, and a good job which I enjoy. All whilst doing well in college. 
Whilst I get emotional by the fact that I believe it could have gotten better for those who were lost, and that I’m living proof it happens and is possible, this also makes me feel empowered. I have managed to get out of a deep depression, decrease my anxiety levels, live on after sexual assault, learn to live with an incurable condition that makes even the simplest things difficult. And if that isn’t something to be proud of then I don’t know what is. 
The other day I was talking to someone who’d lost their best friend to suicide and we were talking about the person I knew who had done the same. He called me strong. And I do believe that that’s what I am. I may be emotional but I am strong. I get on with life with a smile on my face. Get the job done and sometimes even go the extra mile. Not only do I only go to college. I work, volunteer, dance, play squash, play piano, and have time to socialise. 
Telling myself this when I feel low is almost like a recharge. I am strong, and I can do this.",05Dec2019,1
7,"Hello.  
There are numerous things that bother me and I need someone's advice. Number 1 will have a bit of backstory that, I believe, is necessary to understand me better. Number 2 and the following will be the problems that I don't know how to deal with, I will appreciate any advice.

1. I am an immigrant in USA, 20 years old. I immigrated 4 years ago when my relative married an American and got a visa. I lived with my parents until 4th grade, then for the rest of high school I moved out to my grandparents and after that I was in USA, with my relative (mother who divorced with my father) and her new husband.  
During my childhood time with my mother and father, they were neglecting me and ignoring their parental duties, spoiling (in a bad way: allowing to eat junk food, drink beer, wine, showing me pornography etc.), sheltering (prohibiting me from making friends) and shaming me or having fights all the time. Both of them are narcissistic, hateful and toxic people, though I was unable to realize that for a long time, so I was often dealing with guilt.  
When I moved out to my grandparents, things got a little better because they are more responsible and healthier. Overall, my best childhood memories came from them and I see my grandparents as my parents. During the time with my grandparents, I started discovering my hobbies and improved as a person. That said, when I moved out to USA, I noticed that my grandparents aren't too different from my father and mother. Or rather, they are the best version of what my father and mother could be if they weren't mentally ill and hateful. I also believe that part of the issues with my grandparents come from the fact that they grew up in Soviet Union. I definitely don't feel like my grandparents would be able to understand me and they were (and still are) constantly bullying my aunt (their daughter) for various reasons, they're pretty much using her whenever they feel like they need to vent and hate on someone. My aunt had numerous issues with my grandparents and she behaves like a child who wants her parent's approval for everything, that's what their bullying did to her. I got lucky only and was treated well only because my grandparents love their son (my father) too much and they are spoiling him so much that now, him being almost 50 years old, he still can't clean his house or cook normal food - he always goes to my grandparents and eats there and is overall a very irresponsible, insecure person. Why I am mentioning this? To show why I don't feel like my grandparents are someone I can trust, even though I do appreciate the fact that they are much better than my ""parents"". I definitely don't feel like there's anyone who I could talk to.  
Now, about my relative (mother) and her American husband. My mother ran away from my father when I was in 5th or 6th grade, at that time I was already living with my grandparents. Then one day she came back and said that she married to an American and I can immigrate. I agreed because my origin country is in bad standing, it hasn't recovered from Soviet Union, the economy is bad and there is currently a war on the east of my country, young men are forced to serve 1-1.5 year at army which is overall a terrible experience. Army in my origin country is a terrible experience and it's nothing like serving in USA or Europe. So, obviously I don't want to be there.   
Now, my relative (mother) and her husband are both abusive, narcissistic people who are constanly having fights and are pretty much the textbook example of ""toxic relationship"". After 4 years of knowing them, I am able to realize who they are and I don't want to make examples of situations of abuse because that'd just take too much time, so I'm asking to believe me.  
My current situation is this: I am going to college (after 3 years of doing nothing but listening to them fighting), I have only 6 months left until I get an Administrative Assistant certificate which should help me to find work. The walls in this house are very thin, so I can hear everything my relative and her husband do and it feels like I'm in the same room with them 24/7. It wouldn't have been such a big issue if they were normal people, if hearing them speak wouldn't make me remember all the things they did and keep doing to me. Additionally, a big issue here is fighting which they love - again, textbook toxic relationship with fights like ""why you spent so much money on Amazon?"" and ""You have someone else, don't you?!"". The fights happen at least once per week, and that's a good situation - my first 3 years here, the fights were happening at least 3 times per week. Now, my mother is mentally ill and when she screams, she can go on for hours and it's very loud. I am using earplugs but the sound goes through anyway, earplugs have definitely helped me but the first 3 years - I did not have earplugs and listening to their constant fights (which can go on for hours) ruined the already messed up mental health of mine. That combined with the occassional bullying from her husband (which intensified and turned into abuse within the last year) has made me more depressed than ever. I wake up every morning with the thought ""I need to get out of here"" and I hate myself for allowing them to do this to me, for being in this house after her husband abused me, violated my privacy, laughed at me with his beer-buddies and threatened to call police on me (after he himself assaulted me and provoked).  
The good thing is that her husband desperately wants to keep his public appearance and appear as the best guy every, so I did manage to have him pay for my college (though, my tuition isn't particularly expensive). So, overall my situation is not as bad as some other people have it, but obviously it's not a good situation and it is making me feel awful. My hobbies save me and if not for that, I would not be able to go on.  

2. One of the main problems I have right now is loneliness. I don't feel okay outside unless it's the evening, I cannot go anywhere without someone driving me (because I am in Texas, a small town which doesn't have any roads that you can walk, unlike my origin country everyone has to drive here. The people that I live with are moving out to a different city which, luckily for me, has buses, so I will be able to travel on my own in December and after that) and overall I'm not sure why people enjoy ""going out"" and etc.. Additionally, I'm not comfortable with eye contact which isn't a big deal for me, I'm used to it but it causes some distress from other people. I cannot focus if I have to look someone in the eyes, and especially I cannot do that when I'm speaking in a language that isn't native to me (English). I've learned to give them a glance or two to show that I'm listening but this is the maximum of what I can do, talking to others or listening to them is very exhausting to me and I don't see that changing, it's just how it is for me (maybe it's due to head trauma that I received as a child, I don't know).   
Regardless, I tried to find a friend on the Internet numerous times but most of the time it's not enough to me or it ends up bad. I tried to go on various reddit places, discord servers, forums etc. where people find friends, and occassionally I did find someone who was willing to talk to me but it never felt like a real friendship. Some people would, indeed, take their time and reply to my messages, usually it was in long convos, some other would just send me a few messages but nonetheless online friendships never felt real to me and as of now, I'm locking my online profiles from any contact because I don't believe that any friendship can happen on the Internet.  
I also tried to find a friend in real life by going on some online websites or just looking for someone from my area. This was the worst experience because, not sure why, but whenever I find someone from my area - they usually don't share the same interests as I do, and it's not like I have any idea of what to talk about even if we would have similar interests. Plus, just liking the same thing doesn't add topics to talk about because we can both like movies but be into totally different genres. I've tried to go on a meeting with a few people once and all the time I didn't know what to say, so they were bored.   
Also I want to mention that in my high school years, I've had a year when I was trying to be friends with my peers. I repeated the same thing when I was in college in my origin country... both attempts ended up bad and I was bullied which caused some great trauma. I've found myself remembering the bullying much more often nowadays and I often have the urge to contact those people. I know they wouldn't regret their bullying and it was my mistake for trying to be friends with them but I do feel that urge. The worst thing about high school bullying was laughing - it was a small village school and there were only 4 people in my class. At first, I was not interacting with them (and they weren't touching me because my grandfather was the teacher in that school), then I started talking to them and we were friends, I'd say. They weren't good to me, though and I've noticed how they were discussing me behind my back and some other things, so eventually I stopped talking to them. That's when they started bullying me and I wasn't trying to defend myself. It was very bad for my mental health because, again, they laughed at me daily and on every class. During that year, I went back to my usual ""lost in thoughts"" mode, still the constant laughing left me traumatized and now whenever I hear someone laugh, I assume they're laughing at me - often my assumptions end up true.   
Then when I started recovering, the bullying happened again in college, I just didn't get lucky with my peers, they were bad people even though I should have done some things differently... I'm also having obsessive thoughts where my mind starts to race and I remember how I was bullied. In the worst case scenario I start to phantasize about torturing those people in the most brutal ways possible, to psychologically abuse them so that they would see how I felt - it brings great pleasure to me and it's difficult to stop these thoughts when they occur. These obsessive thoughts can also be about the bad moments from my relatives and parents and I don't know how to control them.   
At this point I'm not sure if I ever want to have a friend, the best thing for me could be to find someone with similar hobbies on the Internet and talk to them once per week or so. Not only does being around others in real life (and Internet!) exhaust me, but I don't think I'll ever be able to trust anyone, at least without major efforts.  
I'm not able to understand what type of friendship I should pursue: a real-life one or Internet. Putting aside my homestead problems and overall depression, I don't have a single clue of what I'd do with someone if I was to meet them in real life. Also I would definitely feel sad because I don't think that anyone would have me as their best friend, it's just the general observation I've made - I've never seen someone who would seem genuinely interested in being more than just someone who they talk to occassionally. This leads to another problem - pursuing a relationship. I'm thinking that the best thing for me would be to find someone to talk about hobbies on the Internet and try to pursue a relationship by going on one of the dating websites. By having someone to talk to on the Internet, I wouldn't be annoying my partner and feeling sad if they would not have enough time for me and by having a partner, I'd definitely not feel lonely. What I'm not sure of is if it's okay for me to look for a partner when I'm in this situation... should I wait until I move out? It might take a year. I'm feeling bad about the idea of finding someone because I don't have anything good to say: my childhood and young years were mostly bad, I don't really care about politics or most of the things people like (TV, sports etc.), I have two hobbies which I try to explore but that's it. Since I'm in a bad financial situation and an immigrant (though, my papers are ok), since I will most likely appear as needy and since people tend to laugh at me, I don't know if it's ok for me to look for someone even though I want to.
3. I've had bad hygiene for a long time which caused some issues with my genitals. I had to go through a circumcision in order to fix the problem and while it fixed the previous problem, I've got another. It was a year since the operation but I'm unable to masturbate more than once per 1-2 days without having issues with the genital skin. If I masturbate without lube, the area where the circumcision was made gets swollen and it's pretty disturbing. If I am using lube, it doesn't get swollen but the skin (on the area of the cut) looks a little worn out, not sure how to describe but I'm not confident I'd be able to use it again after ejaculation. Since I wouldn't last long, I would need to do it more than one time, no?    
Also I'm having an issue with sex drive, and it being too overwhelming. I masturbate once per two-three days and it's not enough. It might be connected to the porn addiction that I've been dealing with. While I am able to stop myself from watching porn, the erection happens too often, I'm worried that it might be annoying to my potential partner especially since I'm not sure whether or not I can ejaculate more than one time due to the skin issue.  
Over the time I realized that sex is not important at all and I could get by with masturbation, so if my partner wouldn't want to do that - I wouldn't mind. But what if it is important to them?? How do I even explain the issue with the skin to someone? 
4. Work. As of now I'm feeling scared of work. I did try to find it in my current situation but after applying for everything I could within 4 months... I've had only two interviews, both of which were at fast-food (I don't mind, as long as they pay) but they didn't hire me. I've no experience and my education is foreign (it is evaluated as equal to USA high-school, though), my college certificate will be ready only in 6 months + I don't look presentable. I do my best to look decent but there's some issues like my posture or bad hair. Within these 3 years, there was a time when my mother's husband would not want to take me to a barber shop so I had to cut my hair by myself. I messed it up and it doesn't grow properly now. It is also dry and broken and no shampoo seems to fix it. I was able to visit a doctor but the doctor didn't really tell me anything useful, just looked at it and gave me some medicine which caused me to puke. When I told him that, he replied ""yeah, that medicine can cause this"" and then recommended me to do a hair surgery or something (which I obviously can't afford).   
So, my looks are not very presentable and I can't fix them until I move out. To move out, I need work so it is a closed circle... I'm hoping that the certificate I will get at the college will help me to find work. Plus as I mentioned, my mother and her husband are moving out to a different city which seems to have more work and buses. So, there's more chances there. I will be applying as soon as I can but I'm not sure how I'll be spending majority of the day at work if I don't feel okay around other people.

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine, studying the roles that online mental health communities play in users' lives. The goal of my research is to produce actionable insights towards improving spaces like r/mentalhealth and the wellbeing of their members. I am posting to ask you to take my survey about your experiences and observations as members of an online mental health community. 

The survey will take about 10-20 minutes to complete and everyone who takes it will be entered in a raffle for a $100 gift card (with a 1/100 chance of winning). The survey does not ask for any information that would reveal your identity. You can take the survey here: [https://uci.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_5BAtknr01mbxa29](https://uci.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5BAtknr01mbxa29)

10,"I see my psychiatrist for the second time this week. He already diagnosed me with bipolar II, major depression, and generalized anxiety. By our conversation, I think it’s safe to say he suspects I might have PTSD as well. I’ve been reading up on PTSD and also borderline personality disorder. I’ve noticed I exhibit the majority of the symptoms associated with those disorders. Would it be out of place for me to ask my psychiatrist if I have PSTD and BPD??",05Dec2019,1
11,"I've lived with moderate social anxiety most of my life, and recently started going to counseling to deal with it. Through this counseling I've come to terms with the fact that my social anxiety is almost exclusively rooted in dating and relationship anxiety. I am 23M who has never had a long-term or stable relationship and have spent a majority of this year discouraged about whether  or not things will ever come together for me.

Over the past few months I've gotten to know this girl who matches my energy really well and we've become good friends. In the past few weeks, I've become romantically interested in her and it really appears that she feels the same (although I could be wrong). She also lives with social anxiety and relationship anxiety and we've been very open with each other about it, and she has been the victim of abuse through her childhood and teenage years and even into her first years of college. Her history is largely the source of all the anxiety - again she has been very open with me about all of this.

A few weeks ago, this girl told me she tends to panic and withdraw at the first obvious sign that someone she is interested in is reciprocating those feelings. I finally felt confident enough to ask this girl on a date a few days ago, to which she said yes. However, a day later she seemed a little nervous and distant, and the day after was entirely withdrawn and seemed to be in a state of near-panic around me. It's fairly easy to see what happened, so I've been trying to give her space and decided that I want to try and meet up with her soon to tell her that I would like to go out with her, but only when she feels comfortable with it and pretty much entirely put control of what happens here in her hands.

This has all been a very stressful and very difficult challenge, and I understand why she is reacting the way she is.

13,"I've been having struggles with my mental health my entire life. I've never told anyone about what's going on inside my head, even family and my closest friends, for fear of judgement and ostracism. Despite this, people have seen that I routinely don't talk to people, hate myself, am negative, am a loner, etc. and have forced me to see a counselor. I will say right here that I do not trust counselors at all- they don't offer any actual advice for fixing problems (e.g. bad body image and losing weight), they just tell you that ""it'll all be ok"".  I am certain that they don't actually care- they're only paid to say that they do.

Well, enough with my rant against counselors. Seeing as I want nothing to do with them and don't have a lot of people in real life to talk to about how I'm feeling, I wanted to post here about it. I also want an opinion from you guys (even if you aren't necessarily a psychiatrist/psychologist but I would be honored if one did) on perhaps an informal diagnosis for what I'm going through so I can seek further help.

Here I go- I'll write in list format.

1. **Body Image.** Without equivocation, I hate how I look. I feel that I'm overweight and I have a hideously ugly face. Everyone else says that I'm beautiful, but I don't believe them. I feel like I'm the second coming of Shrek. 
2. **Feeling like a loner.** Ever since I can remember I was always the last one picked for all the team games, the kid that during an assignment where everyone picked their group in school the teacher would have to force me to be allowed into one because no group wanted me. I try so hard to make friends and be nice to people, but it just Doesn't. Ever. Pay Off.
3. **Compulsive lying.** Pretty self-explanatory. I feel like I do it to protect myself, but it just ends up destroying a lot of relationships.
4. **Homicidal fantasies.** (PSA I am not a killer or a rapist) A bit out of the blue, but I have extremely sadistic sexual fantasies that usually involve someone getting murdered. Examples include but are not limited to cannibalization of babies, raping underage girls, whipping someone to death with their own flesh.
5. **Lack of empathy.** Simply put, when someone tells me something or asks for advice, I can't relate. Frankly, I don't care as long as it doesn't affect me. I'm also just a very selfish person in general. I don't care about the wants and needs of others as long as I get what I want. 
6. **Egotistical.** Despite my poor body image, I think that I'm better than everyone else, to be frank.

He has told them about a scheme to become the richest people in the world over night and we need to meet him to move into a bunker because we are all targets. 

This is concerning as he has contacted multiple people outside of the family, and none of us have any idea what to do.

I am working on my BA :) I’ve been having such a hard time making friends and talking to people for the simple fact that I am not comfortable in my own skin, I don’t feel attractive. The more I think about it, the more it doesn’t make sense to me. That’s just how I feel. My low self-esteem is playing tricks on me and making me feel like I an not worthy of friendships and making connections with others. I find it hard to attend evens and clubs for this reason. Part of the reason for this is because I truly dislike my body.
I had my daughter when I was 20, I’ve felt so ugly since then. I’m thin but full of flabby skin and stretch marks. My breasts are so saggy, i hate them.
I see all the younger, pretty girls at my school and compare myself to them. I cant help it. I try to love my body but I see more defects than anything. I just don’t feel attractive at all. It’s been really taking a toll on me, more than ever.",05Dec2019,1

I'm 18, I graduated successfully, I live comfortably, I'm from near Melbourne, I work a lot, but despite that I cant help but feel so so hollow.
Ever since I can remember I've had symptoms of what I now know is social anxiety, still don't know how to deal with it. Since I was 13 I guess I've dealt with depression off and on that's slowly gotten worse as the years went on. I've discovered im genderfluid, I hate it, it hurts. I had a best friend for 4 years that understood and accepted me and shaped me into who I am, that friendship ended and now I'm lost, 4 years of what's supposed to be the best years of your life your most influential, and now I've no guide and I'm lost, I have 2 friends that help the best they can but they're far away and I miss the physical connection the touch. I discovered when I was 15 I have an addiction to physical affection, going without it, especially knowing I'll likely never have it again is so so taxing on me. My friends try to make me feel better telling me I'll find someone telling me there's better people out there people that will love me like I love them, I try my hardest to believe them and I appreciate them so much but it all seems so impossible. I don't understand how you meet people how you make friends once you finish school, back then. It was easy you were forced to interact with people and make bonds but out here in the open world, im lost and I'm scared. Hell I'm even thinking about going back to school to do a course or something just so I can make friends.
 I day dream, dream about scenario's and up coming events, dream I'll meet someone and have such an amazing time, all I ever do is dissapoint myself, the person I dreamt of is never there and I'm still alone, I live in a fantasy world and it hurts because I know it will never be real.
I feel hollow, there's no feeling anymore just hollow. Im scared. I've started self harming again, it feels really nice but I know I have to stop, I try my best.
I'm sorry, I just wish I had someone to talk to, I know I won't find anyone but heh I day dreamed that by some miracle I'll find some amazing person Here that would actually want to talk to me.",05Dec2019,1

She didn’t want to date in secret anymore because it’s taking a toll on her mentally and she couldn’t afford to strain our relationship further. Tears are streaming down my eyes as I type this up but I feel like I’ve just lost the love of my life. She was my soulmate - she took good care of me, she comforted me during my darkest days, she understood me inside and out, she loved me for who I was but most importantly, she loved me more than anyone has ever loved me. I spent the entire night crying, staring blankly at the ceiling and constantly blaming myself for everything that has happened. Bearing in mind, this is my first ever breakup so it’s hurts a lot more. I don’t deserve this at all and neither does she. I feel so lost right now and I’m starting to think that nothing ever goes right for me, no matter how hard I try. I’ve been wanting to send her a message to see how she’s doing but I’m too afraid to do so because I fear that any sort of interaction with her in the meantime would trigger something bad.

20,"So I have been a victim of mental illness for many years now. I am very suicidal and I am pretty much a loner. I have very few friends and when I have spoken to them about how I feel they reacted very badly and made me feel like a burden to the extent I don’t like talking about how I feel. 
I’m worried because I’m in my third year at university and I’m doing very badly. I am not looking forward to the year ahead. I sleep all day and night when I don’t have something to do for university so it is really the only reason I find myself doing anything productive. 
I hate my life, I haven’t met the right people/friends, my relationship with my family is BAD, I am going through heartbreak, I really just do not want to live.
 It is horrible because people who are terminally ill or people suffering want the chance to be able to live normally and I should be grateful that I have that ability. However, I am not. If I could switch places with someone terminally ill I would. I feel guilty and there seems to be no way out of this mindset. So I have been thinking about going travelling on my own because it’s the only thing I think will make me feel a bit better.

28,"To start I always had a lot of imagination, I wrote screenplay and I’m a very creative person. But I’m also a very depressive person even if people around me deny me the right to call me depressive. 

When I was a preteen, I fantasize about “dream lovers”, I wrote in a my diary about the fake life I would love to have. When people wrote their real life in their diary, I wrote a fake life. Even when I started to date people, it continued to wrote in my diary about these fake lovers. 

In High School I had several boyfriends but I continued, to fantasize on my diary about fake lovers especially 3 différents who were fighting for my love. It’s funny because I could have wrote about my current lovers but I didn’t. Through the years these 3 guys went to teenagers to men , with very unique and complex personalities. 

When, i left high school for college. I had several long relationship with various guys. But strangely I kept writing in this diary about these same fake lovers. However, this time I included them in my real environment. If in my real life, I went in holiday with my real lover, when I was back home, I wrote in my diary that I went in holiday with my fake lover. I even fantasize about breaking up with these fake lovers. And strangely I was more emotionally damaged by fake breaking up than real ones.

One year ago I met a guy who was the spitting doppelgänger of one of my fake lovers. I dated him, and I became extremely attached to him very quickly because he was what I dreamed of for years. Of course this jerk dumped me because I refuse to have sex with him quickly because I wanted him to fall in love with me before. Things I’ve rarely did with my former real boyfriends. 

I entered in an huge depression after this breakup. The thing who healed me was to write in my diary that a fake lover that in my imagination I dated since I was 14 years old came back to me , and said I was the only one.

I’m still writing in this fucking diary, and if I don’t i become depressed.

To be clear I have no problem to find someone to date. People wants to date me. But I refuse to engage myself in a relationship I prefer to fantasize about fake romance on a diary like a fucking teenager.

What kind of mental health I have ? 

From the outside I’m a normal person. My friend don’t understand how I can be happy being alone. But in my mind I’m not alone because I have an imaginary boyfriend.

People might feel like they're more connected to the world by being so close to their phones at all times.
Even though they can help us be more productive and improve the quality of our lives — it can also be a major source of distraction and stress. the cons seem to outweigh the pros overall.

When we wake up in the morning checking social media notifications we are waking up on other people's thoughts and updates rather than thinking about us. Notifications like reminder for your pending bills, controversial news and lots of other unwanted stuffs can create stress, distract your mind and also trigger anxiety.

When checking social media and other entertainment notifications the brain releases lot of dopamine — a neurochemical that makes you feel rewarded. The brain craves dopamine like an eight-year-old craves candy, so it will stimulate the repetition of behaviours that lead to the dopamine release.

In other words, when you start your day by mindlessly scrolling through social media or other unwanted news, your brain will stimulate you to repeat this behavior throughout the day, as it knows it will quickly and easily feel good (especially when your day is less stimulating or gets challenging). This will pollute your brain with unwanted information as well as waste your time.",05Dec2019,1

37,"Hi everyone, 

To contextualise, I am very actively grieving. I am 27 years old. This year I lost my mom (my only parent).  I was working outside of the country. I returned to Canada after living abroad for just over 4 years. Shortly after my mom passed, I was sexually assaulted when I was walking to the gym. I am currently teaching full time. My circumstances are tough, my job is stressful with the weight of my anxiety. I know I am grieving but I would like advice about what makes sense moving forward.

I'm looking for advice/experiences regarding medication (i.e. anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants). I've never taken anything for depression or anxiety before, the only medication I have taken consistently was hormonal birth control and I had very negative physical and psychological side effects. That experience made me cautious in regards to what I put into my body. I generally avoid substances (i.e. alcohol or drugs), I even limit vitamins as I have no deficiencies and prefer to generally practice a moderately healthy lifestyle with diet and exercise.

Not to stigmatise medication, I am just very fearful of the potential side effects such as personality changes. As I have experienced this on birth control, I took different combinations of pills for over two years (to fit the ""right fit"") and in the end, I stopped it and finally felt like myself again. I'm not sure if this is a fair comparison, but on the BC I felt very depressed and anxious. I realise if I had a thyroid problem now for example, I'd take medication daily to regulate the function of that organ and I wouldn't blink. I assume that in regards to anxiety and depression, that medication would serve a similar function. The purpose is to improve the quality of my mental health.

I am currently seeing a therapist and practicing CBT. I find yoga and exercise helpful for mood. I'm also working on self care (setting boundaries, resting, trying to surround myself with friends - I took a week off of work to decompress). I recently celebrated my mom's birthday which was painfully emotional. Every time I feel like self regulating again or getting into a routine, I am slammed by an overwhelming sense of grief. As of lately (I'm assuming) I'm so stressed, I have blurred vision (tunnel vision), headaches, heart palpitations, and general shakiness and a feeling of being over stimulated in certain environments. To clarify, I am seeing my new family doctor tomorrow. I am just concerned that they will dismiss my symptoms or feelings and write me a prescription.

Is it a healthy option to choose to ""ride out"" this transitional time in my life, or is it proactive to consider medicating?",05Dec2019,1
38,"I was talking to my psychiatrist about possibly having OCD but also expressed my doubts about it, hos it might be a reach.  Because I read that people with OCD tend to think in black or white, meaning if thjngs dont get done properly they expect the worst  irrational outcomes, like ending up dying or whatever (pls correct me if im wrong). BUT mine isnt as extreme as that. I dont feel anyone's goibg to die, but I do get agitated. For example, when I ask someone to say ""I'm a poop head,"" and they say ""I'm a shit head"" instead, it makes me super agitated. Or when our professor gives everyone handouts, and my seatmate accidentally switches mine and hers, i get agitated. Even when they're the exact same copies. Sometimes the tiniest things have to be in a certain way for me to feel okay with a situation and deviations from them make me panic.

39,"I’m in my 30s.  I’m delusional.  Except I don’t know if I’m really delusional.  I don’t know who to talk to.  I’ve been involved with the community mental health team since I was a teenager, but I’ve only ever been hospitalised for an emergency detox from alcohol.  I don’t know how or why this has been the only time I’ve been admitted, given the states I’ve been in, but this lack of attendance from the MHT feeds into my delusions… or what I perceive may be my delusions (from a rational POV?)... because if they really were that delusional, then how am I not stuck in a hospital ward?  I’ve always been capable of holding a lucid, intelligent conversation, and I’ve said many times that I feel like my ability to express myself works against any potential help I might need as it gives the impression I’m more together than I might be internally.  I don’t want to continue existing because the rational side of my head says what I think isn’t possible and if it isn’t real I don’t want to live.  The only reason I can see to stay alive is the possibility that what I know -in the delusions- is real.  But those thoughts are completely insane.  I don’t know how to rationalise what I see, feel, remember and recognise and experience in voices and visions as anything other than a spiritual aspect that I am intrinsically part of… but it is utterly irrational.  I want it to be real.  But that doesn’t necessarily make it real.  I’m embarrassed about it.  I’m conflicted.  I’m lost.  I can’t even talk about it properly because it’s so stupid?  I feel it in every part of me whenever I am capable of any kind of feeling, which is rare, since most of the time I can’t feel anything at all.  But when I can I am connected to all that exists in every aspect from macro- to microscopic.  I want it to be spiritual but I don’t see any scientific proof anywhere that the spiritual world is real.  My rationale rails against my gut.  I don’t know what to believe.  

I’ve tried a variety of psychiatric medication and nothing has worked.  You try to treat the symptom but this is embedded on a level that goes beyond symptomatic.  It’s systematic.  And then I just want to die and hope I have some autonomy on deciding the next move but I’m terrified that it’s just a regurgitation of the same shit or it’s just nothing.  Or maybe nothing sounds preferable.  I don’t know.  I want to call the mental health team and beg them to admit me but for what?  I don’t respond to medication.  I want to die and I don’t.  I can engage with them in depth on whatever subject they throw at me.  What are they going to do with me?  I keep thinking I should just kill myself because I can’t deal with medication and I’m a drain on the system and I’m never going to get the answers I’m looking for and I hate this.

I’m so fucking alone I don’t know where to turn.  So I wish I was dead.  I wish I’d never been born.  None of this makes sense.  Why do I feel like this?

I feel like there’s something wrong with me. I almost feel like I’m insane, that everything i say only makes sense to me and everyone else pretends to understand.  Everything about me and my character seems to be crumbling and I’m just letting it slip through my fingers.

I’ve always been more introverted, i don’t like to talk to people much due to my personal suspicion that they only pretend to enjoy my company or only pretend to laugh. As a result I mostly stay in my room and don’t interact much with others. I have a wonderful and supportive family, but I almost feel like I’m weighing them down. I never want to go out with them, I only want to stay in my room. I never want to go down and talk to them. I’ve felt incredibly useless this past year and I really don’t enjoy that feeling. I don’t know what to do anymore, it seems like too much effort to go and do anything. I just feel like everything I am is falling apart and it scares me and I don’t know what to do or how to adapt. I’m just scared.

However; my one-on-one therapist has said that she ""no longer feels comfortable meeting with me"" because I ""require a higher level of care"". This is shit, because it means three-hour outpatient sessions. probably multiple weeks a night. Or day treatment or res. because I am a minor, I physically have to participate in these things. Even though I really don't think it's what I need right now, the police have been involved. But I won't get into the legal side of my situation. I am a college and high school student in dual enrollment, who works 26 hours a week and is graduating a year early. I'm busy. 

Because it is being suggested by every single human being who has authority over me, there is no getting out of this ""higher level of care"" shenanigan.

In first of depression I know how hard it is to remember to take your meds. When I’m depressed, I don’t eat or drink much and my body just kinda goes in sleep mode for a few days. Because I have to take my medicine with food not water and the fact that I get lazy depression, I would take it just when I remembered. This week I have been focusing on taking it exactly at 1PM everyday and I feel really normal for once.

Sometimes I zone out and stare at one thing for minutes at a time. It feels like I can't move, I forget to blink, and sometimes I forget to even breathe. During this time everything touching me (my clothes, my tongue in my mouth, the position of my toes or any other body part) feels hyperrealistic and uncomfortable. I can feel my heart beating, and I can hear the air going into and out of my lungs. Every noise I can hear becomes somewhat overwhelming and intensified (music in the car, people arguing, other people talking, traffic noises) I feel like I'm not me. Almost like I'm watching someone else live their life though a thick pane of glass. I see and I hear the things that are happening but they don't seem to register completely in my head. I feel alienated, sometimes it's such a jarring feeling that I want to cry. It's as if out of nowhere I took this person's life and all of their memories, and tried to make it my own even though I know it's not. After a couple minutes, I move my eyes, I move my fingers, and I'm able to move my entire body without feeling weird and uncomfortable about it.

And honestly if it wasn't for her and the music I listen to, there's a chance I probably would've ended it this past summer.

The reason why I couldn't and still can't bring myself to do it, is because I couldn't stand to break her heart that way.  She's actually encouraged me to go out to concerts and hell even helped me nab some dates.  She's been the greatest thing that's ever happened to me in my life so far.

This. This is long I am so sorry I just need to get it off my chest.
I am (F) 17 years old. When I was 10 years old, I has been taken out of my mom and dads custody after authorities had found out they were physically and mentally abusive alcoholics. They fucked me up and left me a fragile child. I had nobody after that other then the family that took me in.
I had met a girl 2 years later who instantly attached to me. I had never had that happen before. I was a “loner”, or more so a mentally broken child who was only just getting treatment at that time, but regardless I had been alone in any aspect with other kids.
She clung to me and we did everything together. She lived only two houses down from me. Wed sleep over every weekend, every weekday after school we were at one of our houses. We were inseparable. 
Slowly as the time went on, she got more and more... violent towards me. Shed often yell, “playfully” kick and hit at me, make fun of me and more. That should have been an immediate red flag to little ol’ me, as gee, didnt my parents do this for 10 years? But no, I thought nothing of it. She has cared for me like nobody else did.
I slowly developed feelings for her. I had gotten some other friends, but I wasnt as close with them as I was with her. I was always texting her, hanging out with her, almost 24/7. She never wanted to stop talking to me. It got bad after awhile. If i didnt spend time with her one day after school, or if i wasnt allowed to sleep over, she would take it out on me. She would verbally abuse me either in person or over text, and as 12-13 year olds she started indirecting me harshly on instagram. She would block me for short periods, then unblock me, plea for forgiveness that I always gave her. 
Thats innocent stuff. Skipping around, it got awful. I had only just come out to my guardian that I was bisexual, and she had told me to wait till highschool to date. Of course I was “longing for a girlfriend”, and my friend despised that. At one point, she confessed. I explained my mutual feelings to her but that I wasnt allowed to date yet and I was frankly scared to, despite wanting a relationship. She took it hard. She would get more and more angry, yell at me, hit me more. She would force me to be with her everywhere. When sleeping over, if I was falling asleep, she threatened to leave me forever if I didnt stay up with her. I started to take medication to keep me awake. That resulted in an almost accidental overdose on a camping trip with her, where 13 year old me is panicking over taking too many pills, and her not giving too shits. I had vomited several times, got lost as we were in the middle of the woods a couple states away from our own, and cried when I got back. I cried to her that I was sorry I was an awful person. And she fueled my hatred for myself. She agreed. She made me feel that way.
I was so desperate for love and for someone I stuck with her. I stopped being friends with others for her, I got in trouble for her so many times. I always apologized for things she did. I always took the fault. I always took the hits.
Im. Gonna stop going into detail with this because good fucking lord this is long—
To shorten this aspect up, shes out of my life. She moved, shes gone and I have never spoken to her again.
Now, at 17, I cant trust anyone. Im constantly paranoid. I care for so many people and I know they care back, but I cant ever open up to them now. Im scared they are going to be like her. Im scared im going to end up in that situation again.
I have a partner who I love and they love me back. But im always thinking that it could all snap. Theres no signs of it, theres nothing bad at all about our relationship. Its healthy, it genuinely is. And yet, im so scared its going to happen all over again.
How do I stop this endless loop of paranoia and fear? How do I start to trust people in my life again? I cant get rid of her. Shes gone but shes still here and I want her out but I cant do it, im not strong enough.

This ended up in depression and later a suicide attempt. I always felt guilty, like that has to be my fault. I have to be guilty otherwise something happened to me, something bad and terrible. He had nude pictures of me at the age of 13. I thought it was consensual, i thought that he liked me a lot. I always blame me for everything that happened, even when i was sexually assault bu other men, i still blame me for that. Because it was easier blaming me than admitting that i was r%$#.

Right now I don’t know what to do about my feelings. Every time I tell my gf about what I’m feeling I end up being more depressed. Telling friends would also lead to the same results. This led me to wonder if I should go to therapy.

I have no idea what's going on in my life at this moment. It's like I'm two people on the same head, and at the same time, I'm not.
 My mom has always treated my sister in an abusive way, for pretty much her whole life. She recently moved out, and I'm still living with my mom. My sister is the older one, and I was never treated wrong before this, nor did I realize the way my mom treated my sister wasn't right.
My mother started to call me names, shortly before my sister moved out. Things like monster, bad words, and ironically, daughter of a bitch. She became more and more aggressive both physically and verbally. Eventually, I'd get called a horrible daughter, inconsiderate, a fucking monster, and so on for correcting her about a small thing. A lot of the times she'd hit me, mostly for crying or screaming in pain because she hit me(oof).
My social life is pretty much limited to school, and recently a ""friend"" of mine who said that she was my best friend multiple times, had been my friend for the whole year and never had an issue with me suddenly stopped talking to me. She'd ignore me, no matter what I tried to do to fix the problem. How can I fix a problem if I don't know what the problem is? Before that, I had quite a few friends and my crush actually liked me(wow, lucky bitch.), but that same ""friend"" became best friends with both my at the time best friend and my crush. They both stopped talking to me, no explanation whatsoever.
At the last day of school(I live in a different country so we get vacations that begin earlier and last longer than Americans') she was talking to me normally, following me around and even hugging me. When I asked why she stopped talking to me she simply said ""she forgot.""
Also, I'm soon gonna have to leave the city I lived in for my whole life, because I'm gonna move to my dad's house. He lives in the other side of the country, and he's not even close to being a terrible parent like my mother, so I'm definitely lucky to have only endured 7 months of this abuse.
My actual best friend who I've known for 2 years hasn't been talking to me that much. She's going through a ton of shit also(helicopter parents and shitty classmates) but she seems somewhat okay. She hasn't told me of any issues, but I've seen a change in her behavior- she's way more aggressive than she used to be.

So, to sum it all up, I've lost my school friends, dealth with abusive mother for half a year, possibly lost my best friend and am soon gonna lose the one thing I have left: having a family that would understand the shit I'm going through,namely my sister.

I've just realized that something isn't right with me: I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts(thankfully just thoughts), have been sleeping a lot but still feeling tired(mostly at school, fell asleep during lessons A LOT), have been getting easily annoyed, some self esteem issues, and, weirdest of all, the game I loved the most feels like it's suddenly cringy and idiotic. This happened to a lesser extent to all my interests.

I've been wanting a game for 2 years now, and I've been asking for the console and the game ever since. My mom said ""my dad would buy it"" and my dad just told me to wait. My love for the game just grew more and more over the past months. If you go to any of my social media, you'll find the game: youtube content about it, twitter posts mostly focused about it, and I think my reddit profile picture is set to an image from the game. 

I've been having some confusion with the gender I identify as recently. I currently identify as male, but I have told just 1 person about it(and now the whole internet lmao)

With all those blocks of text that are just me listing my problems, I feel like I'm suffering a lot, yet I have no right to. I don't feel like I have any mental illness, there are worse parents, worse classmates, worse siblings, and worse situations. I feel like I don't even have the right to be complaining about anything. The game thing is spoiled: 2 years doesn't justify anything. 
The mom thing could be worse. My sister could treat me like my mom. My dad could treat me like my mom. The class thing could be worse, I'm lucky to even be studying and not being some sex slave or one of those kids who have to work to even be able of affording anything for the family. And the things I'm feeling? Hah, it's not anything too bad, it can't be. A teenager girl probably would be faking depression, so it definitively can't be anything serious. Same goes to the gender thing. It's definitely something that'll go away soon. I'm a girl, and I can't change that. And my friend? I'm lucky to even have her in the first place. I'm lucky to even have a family. A mom that buys me food. A good school. Etc. And also, my sister was able of taking this ""abuse"" for years and years, a few months is nothing.
There can always be something worse, so why the fuck am I complaining?

...Yet, at the same time, I feel like this isn't right. My sister and I shouldn't have been going through any of what my mom said/done. She abused my sister a lot, mostly physically. My classmate was fucking trashy and there's no denial on that. My friend shouldn't be going through the shit she's going through. Surely, a woman who spends pretty much $250 a week on the mall could've saved up $550 in two years, right? What if the gender thing isn't just a made up thing? I really don't feel like it is. And the fact that there's someone out there who's dealing with worse things doesn't make my suffering any less valid.


I have no idea what's going on with me, I just made this post at 1 am after deleting everything related to the game and anything else I like due to it being cringy. I've set an alarm to 5 am because ""I don't deserve sleep."" 


(I've been seeking psychological help, but I'm not sure it helped. It barely lasted a month or two, so I guess that's why.)

[my face ](https://imgur.com/a/rjmPeJp)


When I was 16, I had this older guy take advantage of me at a party with his friends. They were both 18. Afterward, they ignored me and bragged to their friends, calling me gross. His younger brother was in my grade, and his friends bullied me too before that happened. I had no social media, and they would make posts about how I looked old and that I'm a fat sl*t. 



They would pick apart my features every day.
My lips are too thin, eyes too close together, man jaw, prominent chin, and that I was the ugliest girl in school. I moved away at 18 to a new state; it's been four years since all this happened. The guys in my grade would ask me for sex but tell me not to tell anyone because I was so ugly. They would say no man will ever want me. They said I'm attractive enough to sleep with but not to be seen with me.
I’m just saying why else would people treat me so horribly? 




Like a random girl from a different school at a party when I was 16 took a photo of me scrunching my face. She egged me on like “your so cute” then posted it online making fun of me calling me ratchet and her guy friends saying I look like a 40-year-old b*tch. Why would people do this unless ugly? They were all graduated and 18/19 They would say I'm the grossest girl in school, and any guy who sleeps with me is desperate.



They would greet me by telling me I have wrinkles all over my face that I had peeling skin. I was so disgusting I burned and deleted all the photos from school. Is it true when people bully you it shows their character, not yours? Why else would I be treated this way unless I was hideous and annoying? Was this my fault? Doesn't the bullying show I'm weird?",05Dec2019,1

69,"God forbid this is ever traced back to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 15 year old who's suffering from a LOT.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a lot all at once. This is me coming clean about everything. It's really more to let what's on my chest off.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is probably going to disgust and offend a lot of people, so unless you think you can really handle violence, self harm, suicide, delusion, mental disorders, and all sorts of fun stuff, please go.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been told what I've experienced is normal for a teenage girl, but I'm not sure that's right anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know if I should talk to someone about this.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been delusional since I was 10.

I have what I've been referring to as unguarded thoughts. Apparently this is a symptom of OCD, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar Paranoia. I never get a break. I feel like people can see what I'm thinking all the time. Like they're watching me. It's not really this way with family members, but for example, I might look at a movie theater and suddenly all of Hollywood is in my head. I look at a library, authors are suddenly seeing what I'm thinking. Anyone I look at can read my mind. It's been this way for so many years, I don't remember life without it. I also feel like if I'm on social media everyone on that platform can read my thoughts. Right now, I feel like all of Reddit is in my head. 

I usually listen to music and think about stories surrounding my characters or even ideas for a music video with my characters to kind of keep myself in this limbo of being paranoid but not really because they can't see anything awful in my mind if that's the case.

&amp;#x200B;

I lie. a lot. About things that don't or do matter. It's lead to the loss of a lot of friendships. And it's not like I'm lying to make myself cool, it's because it's an impulse and a really bad thing I do naturally. I do it with teachers, friends, family, strangers... 

&amp;#x200B;

I like the way vomiting feels but can't bring myself to force myself to vomit so I say I do. I wake up around 3 in the morning sweating like a bastard and go to the toilet and just stand and stare at it, and then go back to bed and hate myself for not vomiting.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a people person but when I'm around people I constantly realize how loud I'm being and that people probably hate me. I've had friends punch mirrors and scream at me for just being annoying, and it makes me hate myself more because these are the only people who can stand to tolerate me and I anger them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in this weird suicidal limbo where I enjoy life but I also realize how easy it would be to kill myself and get the pain out of the way because nobody will ever love me and I really don't fear death or the pain that comes with suicide, but I know I won't because it would ruin my family's lives

&amp;#x200B;

Although I'm a pacifist and often act as a punching bag for other people and offer myself as one, I have really violent thoughts when I'm mad. I fantasize about torturing child abusers and bad parents. Not just parents that lose child custody for being garbage human beings, but people who let their kids smoke, don't vaccinate their kids, etc. Entitled parents. They're really nasty, violent fantasies.

&amp;#x200B;

I pick open the skin on my fingertips not out of habit/stress but because the pain feels good and I like watching myself bleed

&amp;#x200B;

I get angry easily and scare others.

&amp;#x200B;

I push my family away, including my little sister who looks up to me, just so I can be alone and feel alone and wallow in my own misery

&amp;#x200B;

I OD'd on meds once because my doctor gave me the wrong dosage amount and now I don't trust doctors because my body reacts bad to medication and they often turn me away after a few failed meds or they used my parents like unpaid checks to get backpay

&amp;#x200B;

I'm obscenely narcissistic. I think of myself really highly because I was raised to think of myself as this talented, gorgeous genius, but all of a sudden my parents started calling me out for my egoism and say I'm arrogant. Some days I think I'm just the best but the next day I feel like I'll never amount to anything and my self esteem is everywhere

&amp;#x200B;

I start fights I know I can't win just to give myself something to be upset about

&amp;#x200B;

I pay a lot of attention to my friends and their mental health but they often joke about how guarded I am and that I must be hiding something but they don't know anything about how messed up I am

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm constantly being tracked. Like my phone is bugged by hackers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hear voices and whispers when nobody is around and I see things that aren't there. I see shadow people coming out of the walls and walking around just outside of my vision but when I turn they're not there. They hide in dark rooms and come out when I'm alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd do anything for just about anyone because I'm so starved for human affection.

&amp;#x200B;

All of my friends are dating and apparently there are a ton of guys that like me (according to my guy friends) but I just don't want to drag anyone down and let them date someone like me when they could do better despite really wanting to find someone to give my love to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really smart but never do my homework because of how exhausted I am from keeping my mind busy due to delusions and I sleep about 16-17 hours a day, leading to me not only eating 1 meal a day only and losing a bunch of weight (which isn't good, I'm really skinny already) but I'm failing most of my classes.

&amp;#x200B;

My mind makes up false memories to make my life seem more tragic. I don't feel comfortable with stating these memories due to how absolutely vile they are but they feel very real and I have actual dates, times, places and people in my head. I know I have PTSD from real events that have happened to me but idk if you can get PTSD from a false memory but I've been getting false memory flashbacks which can be triggered

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very OCD and like a clean workspace but I'm so depressed I can't clean it up and it makes me more depressed

&amp;#x200B;

I hardly even manage to play with my cat once a week. It's ok, she likes to watch TV and stays with me no matter what I do but I feel so bad. She's half blind and very tiny due to malnutrition at a young age but I feel she could have a better home but I could never give her up.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll commission more people than I have the money for and then never respond to DMs and hate myself for it. I'm blacklisted from commissioning quite a few popular artists because of it. I feel awful as usually I have the money and then I blow it all out on something pointless that I feel the need to buy at that moment

&amp;#x200B;

My parents adore me and do everything they can to make things better but don't believe me when I say the more outlandish things like me being delusional or hallucinating. The waitlist to see a doctor is 3 months and I'm slowly losing my mind

&amp;#x200B;

Idk. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just needed to say that.

70,"Today something reminded me of all the things that has happened to me in the past while and I had a feeling i should share it here. 

I'm a 20 year old guy, and about a year and a half ago it felt like my life was crumbling around me. I was in my first year of college and in finals week. I was going to the hospital every day because I was close to having my leg amputated, I caught my girlfriend cheating the day after my 19th birthday, my dad was almost half paralyzed from a work injury, and I was so broke my car ran out of gas on my street trying to get home from my last exam. Too broke and too depressed to continue on to my second year, I went job hunting. After three weeks I took the first job that I could get (a heavy truck shop) that turned out to be a laundering front for the mafia. Had to work with chemicals that were so strong that it would dissolve industrial rubber gloves within 20 minutes of putting them on, and once had a drunk guy charge at me with a pressure washer trying to cut me with Sounds cliche, but I felt like everything in life had turned to shit and I was at the end of my rope.

Don't know how I managed but I stuck it out as long as I could and returned back to school this September. I also got a job as an automotive photographer for one of the largest car dealerships in the province I live in, and I've got a career opportunity lined up already when I graduate. My life is far from perfect but it is a hell of a lot better than it was, and all it took was riding it out and keeping my head above water",05Dec2019,1
71,"I'm having a difficult time trying to understand if I have normal teenage angst or if I should be concerned for my mental health. I'm an eighteen year old female in my senior year of high school. I made this account just to make this post because I don't want people I know to see it. I apologize for the novel of text in advance, I just hoped to hear some objective opinions about what's going on with me because I can't understand what my issue is. 

 Over the course of the last year and a half I've been on a steady decline. I cry roughly every other day and my mom always says I'm dramatic or that its because I'm a teenage girl with rampant hormones but that hurts my feelings because I feel genuinely upset. My mom and I had a tumultuous relationship for about a year but we've recently started to reconnect and I am in a constant fear of making her upset so I try to contain it around her but I'm not great at hiding my emotions. I am scared that she thinks I'm dumb and that I'm acting irrationally. I understand why my problems seem minuscule to her because she suffers from depression and has had a difficult life to say the least. 

I honestly have become frustrated by how frequently I feel unmotivated and how easily I become panicked to the point of tears. It sounds ridiculous as I read it back because I feel embarrassed by my constant negative emotion. The embarrassment develops the more I start to think about it and turns into self hatred. I often don't really know what to do with myself because I get angry for being this way but do nothing about it. 

It has taken its toll on my ability to finish school work. I have always been a procrastinator, but it used to be a conscious decision to not do my work because I knew I had the ability and stamina to get it done on time. Now I start my work late because  I put it off to spend time with my boyfriend. I dread the homework the entire time I'm with him but I continue to put it off because I would rather distract myself in the moment. I later regret it and often stay up late to get it done. I acknowledge that I'm choosing to manage my time poorly but I have no motivation to sit down and finish my schoolwork in a timely manner. I get it done because I don't want to fail my classes, but at the expense of a normal sleep schedule and my self esteem.

I often feel insecure about admitting to having a boyfriend, which, may sound ridiculous but I feel frustrated because I feel like people view me differently after they find out about it. I feel that people think I'm blinded by my love for him and that its purely an infatuation that will quickly run its course and burn out. I genuinely like him and I don't want people to assume things about me because I'm in a relationship. It also saddens me that I've lost friends because they don't approve of my relationship or they feel that I don't spend as much time with them.  My mom said that I act happy when he's around but when he leaves I revert back to being dramatic. I have also had many a breakdown in front of him, but I think my mom believes I have some ulterior motive for behaving the way that I do. 

My boyfriend has a complete opposite reaction to my episodes. When I start to cry he gets nervous and reminds me to breath in a very panicked manner because he is concerned for me. He insists that I should seek professional help because he is scared that I will begin to spiral even further than I have. I understand where he's coming from but seeking help has been my last priority because I've been trying to maintain my school work, extra curricular, continuing to create art, and spending time with him. The other reason I haven't made a tremendous effort to get help is it can get quite expensive and the insurance we have doesn't cover a whole lot. I don't want to put the extra finance on my mom and I feel embarrassed to ask.

This one is not uncommon for people my age but I really don't like the way I look. My relationship with food has always been kind of unhealthy. I have never really been thin and I'm usually taller than most. At one point when i was about fourteen I weighed about 190 pounds and I was 5'6"". My weight distributed fairly evenly I wasn't huge but I always felt that way since most of the people in my city are quite petite and thin. Over the course of a couple years, I lost weight and got down to 145 pounds while being  5'8,"" the height I am now. Even at this weight I was still uncomfortable with the way I looked but I was starting to more okay with it. Over the course of the past year I have gained back about twenty pounds and it makes me feel embarrassed. I still exercise moderately but not nearly as much as I once did and my diet has become whatever food is available to me at the time. I constantly get frustrated with myself and I recognize why I've gained the weight I have but again I don't have the drive and desire to maintain it the way I did when I started.

I tried one therapist a few months back and after an hour with me she told me I had ADHD and depression and wanted me to go to the doctor to get medication for it. This seemed way to quick, and I told her I didn't want to do that and she replied saying that it will only get worse if I don't. The experience kind turned me off to the idea of making time for therapy so I decided to put it off.

Perhaps I just peaked my freshman year. I'm at a point where I've gone in circles and I don't know what to do. I wanted to ask people who don't know me personally about all this because I want a different perspective. I feel that it easy for my friends and my mom to jump to conclusions because of their attachment to me. I just wanted to see if I really am being irrational.",05Dec2019,1
72,Whenever I’m talking to someone about something personal that involves me I could never look them in the eyes. I was talking to a friend of mine about my depression and I couldn’t look at them. Now thinking about it I rarely make eye contact with people. Why do I do this?,05Dec2019,1
73,"I’ve spent my entire life known as the quiet kid. I’ve always been pretty anxious and fearful of others. It got to the point that i was so scared of human interaction that I completely stopped going to school and stayed in my room for an entire year, occasionally going out to mow the lawn. During that year I only played video games and gained weight. Come last December I got a job. I’ve lost pretty much all memories of back then, but my boss says i was one of the worst workers mainly because I was too shy. So once I got more used to working and being out I became more and more comfortable in social situations, and even worked my way up to become assistant manager at age 17. I just recently got my first girlfriend and am very happy with her. But Ive always had underlying thoughts of dying, whether it be dreams of me killing myself or my sense of reality fading and once I come back I feel scared and unsafe. Whenever I feel uncomfortable in social situations I don’t know how to react so I just somehow find my way out of them. The other day I was overthinking as I usually do, I began to think my Gf hated me for how I was and went to the bathroom of work and fell into a trance just staring into the mirror. I would go in and out of reality just completely forgetting that I’m alive. Once i came back I was completely silent and didn’t feel the need to talk to anyone even my friends and Gf that were trying to talk to me. My GF and boss are going to college for psychology and they both diagnosed me, of course not professionally with schizotypal personality disorder. My boss says I act very eccentric and odd. There will be times when I will randomly start laughing very loudly, or times when Im baffled and I will put both hands on my face and crouch down in the middle of conversations. To finish this off I’ve never felt like I’ve wanted to live, I mean i’m depressed and scared all the time but never enough to cause physical harm and or kill myself, but i just see life as a burden and that I never asked to be given all these responsibilities . Hopefully that all came out okay",05Dec2019,1

75,"Hi, I suffered from PTSD as a result of multiple death in my family in a short period of time. I got treated however, and did not have any symptom whatsoever for the last 6 months.

My most common symptom was the nightmares and I haven't had them (at least not this realistic kind) in a very long time too.

Today I woke up from my cat's noise and yelled at her because I thought I was saying my last goodbyes to my father. Now, I'm used to seeing a family member (especially my dad cause his hospitilazition was my primary reason for PTSD) die, but I haven't had this vivid and realistic in a while. I had a panic attack when I woke up of course, followed by a flashback.

I also recently (2 months ago) stopped taking any meds cause we thought I didn't need it anymore. Is this a relapse? A temporary thing because I stopped using meds? What the hell it is?

Do keep in mind that flashbacks were rare even when I was still suffering. It was usually nightmares followed by a paranoia attack that usually lasted 1 to 2 days.

Please tell me this is not a relapse, I can't bare going through the same shit again.",05Dec2019,1
76,"I'm 21, male, and I'm not sure I've ever felt alive. My whole life has been incredibly sheltered. I live in a rural location and was homeschooled my entire life. Outside of my brother and parents, I haven't gotten much social interaction.

I had the choice to go to public school. I was asked when I was 15, and I'm sure the offer would have stayed open. But I was too afraid to do it. Along with my struggles with anxiety and depression. I just kept things the same. Now I regret that, more than anything. And it seems like all I do is think about the life I missed.

I'll never get to go on one of those awkward teenager dates. Or be someone's first kiss. Never know the stress of having to do homework. I didn't get to watch my classmates grow up with me over the years. I can't cheer on the high school football team. Hell, I didn't even get the chance to try any sports.

Never get my high school sweetheart. Both of us thinking we are madly in love and planning our life together at 17. To fool around with on a night our parents aren't home. Neither one of us knowing what we are doing, but loving figuring it out together for the first time.

Never go to a party that someone shouldn't be having. One with drugs and alcohol, where it's up to me to decide what I wanna do. Never got to try band class, or do drama class. Or any of the other extra things to help you grow. Never get to ask a girl to prom. To pick her up at her house. Having to have a conversation with her dad, more nervous than I ever thought possible. To finally get my driver's license, and know the freedom of being able to drive yourself to and from school.

I've never done any of the above. Never done drugs, gotten drunk. Still can't drive. I've got no real accomplishments, nothing I'm proud of, no embarrassing moments I try to forget. Nothing that proves I was even alive. And while I'm improving things, and starting to do things that I want. All this is holding me back.

77,"I feel much anxiety, which I believe is a fancy word for fear, with people, social situations, crowds, etc. More so people in general, especially large crowds and places I’m unfamiliar with, but still a good amount just with people in general. I’m not sure if I have anxiety from leaving my house, but I do know I am far more comfortable at home than anywhere else. I can’t tell if I have anxiety from leaving home, but I believe I do because I feel like it would go along with my OCD. I often feel isolated but then again I feel more comfortable alone, well if it’s me and my dog. I know it’s not attachment disorder, because I do love people, it’s just I feel only comfortable with only a few people, and the rest I’m rather uncomfortable. Still, though, i feel very isolated, yet that is something I think I need to be. I always feel more comfortable just staying home and whenever I can I choose to stay home, but I can’t tell if it’s anxiety about leaving home or what it is. Part of me is afraid of social interactions, embarrassment, and making mistakes. Another part of me just doesn’t see the point in social interactions. I want to love and interact, but I’m afraid I’ll screw stuff up and embarrass myself. I feel I need to hide my true self from nearly everyone, or else... I don’t know, people will judge me, hate me, etc. Another major thing is that I’m often afraid, maybe anxious, I’m not sure, about harming people, either physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. with words, actions, letting someone down, etc. and that is another major reason why I don’t like, why I hate, why I fear, why I see no point in social interaction and leaving my home.

I often get a rush of motivation to work on a project, or get my resume done up to apply for a job, things like that - and at first I was really glad and took this as a sign that I was doing better - but often I’ll come crashing down into a depression episode afterward.

I have social issues and cant form meaningful relationships with most people. I have mentioned my fear a bit more than is probably okay and it makes her really upset. I dont think she really gets how bad it is. I go through periods when its every day and periods when its only occasional. Sometimes its so bad that i have to go into the room while shes sleeping to make sure shes still breathing. I need help and dont know what i should do.

85,"When I was a teen I lost 2 parents within 4 years. One through death (mother) and the other (father) through marrying an evil figure in my late teens who was only after his money (I say this to paint a picture of who she is as a person). She saw me as a threat and the subsequent change in my father's behaviour destroyed our relationship (he would not defend me against her and would ostracise and be nasty to me to impress her). It's 10 years later and my relationship with my father is repaired but I will never get back those years where we were fighting and the pain of him showing me how little I meant to him still hasn't gone. He has accepted that he behaved in a crazy way and was going through some sort of ""midlife crisis"" but he still has never apologised to me and thinks he has nothing to apologise for. That I am the one with the problem because I can't ""move on"". How does one move on

I feel like I don't trust any men, I still to this day feel like if my own father can do that to me, how can anyone value me. That is the one person that is meant to love you unconditionally and he chose a low-quality human over me. The period where I really felt I was all on my own in the world left its mark on me. I am going to therapy but nothing is changing, it feels useless. I'm not getting anything from it. We don't talk about my past, just how I feel now.

I have an urge to experiment and do things out of the box. One of these, for example, involves wandering urban regions and sleeping at random places, for example.

I've been hospitalized before because they thought I was on drugs, when I'm literally being myself. I was hospitalized for more severe issues than that before. I do not get depressed but I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 1, though apparently I'm always in a state of mania? Must be very calm mania. What the hell?

So basically I often doubt that I'm sane and just creative. Maybe something is wrong? Why do I have such complex fantasies and ideas, why do I act on them and why can't I just get a boring job, stay in the same house, and participate in the same system as everyone else? Am I just rebellious? Anxious? I will suffer just as much but at least I can do it with the other 2 billion who live our compulsory modern lifestyle. Instead of doing what other people do, why do I spend months studying the speech pattern of dead people? Why do I get deeply fascinated with a subject to such an extent where I can't talk to anyone because no one cares or understands? Why do I feel like there's so many easy ways to improve everyone's lives but no one gives enough a damn?

I feel like I occupy the border between sanity and madness, and my entire life has been others trying to push one of these two sides for me. In reality I blame others but I honestly think my insanity is pushing the sanity out.",05Dec2019,1

I'm losing my fucking mind, and that scares me. I cant sleep. I cant eat. I cant feel, I cant feel anything at all. 
It started with my memory. I felt myself trying to grasp on to what I thought I had left from the past, it left me yearning for it. Im not ready to grow up. It became harder to remember new things and now i cant tell you what someone said to me at the beginning of a sentence by the end. Im never truly there, truly conscious, truly awake. It didnt get worse but it didnt get better. 
I dont think I've learned anything yet, in fact i think I've become less intelligent. I put myself in positions to be a leader and then dont follow up. I am not a leader. I just want to be a part of things but I cant seem to put myself in the right situations for that to happen. 
Its led to this feeling of existential dread that i cant avoid anymore. It taunts me as I try to sleep, so I dont sleep. I stay awake for days, losing my sanity when I try to rest. I fill my time with nothing but pointless wastes so I'm not alone with my own thoughts. I'll do anything to numb them as a result. 
I cant bring myself to be the person I want to be. I feel like i need to start over, or I need to run, to run to something new. I just want to be in a new situation free of my prior commitments. Join something already established that I can be a part of. I cant build it, but I want to be a part of it. I need to try. 
I dont know how to make myself try. I dont know how to make myself do anything anymore. I cant bring myself to do the simplest tast, it's like my mind is fighting me. It wont let me do anything that requires a sliver of energy even if I want to or need to. I want to do the simple things that make me happy but it's like theres this invisible force in my head that stops me. It stops me from doing the things that I love, the things that make me better, and not only the first step towards progress but every single fucking one after that. It needs to change but it's a part of me that wont. Its stopping my from going to sleep right now, it latches on to anything counterproductive and drives me to obsess over until I break free and it grabs onto something else to distract me from myself and my commitments.

92,"hi everyone. male, 29 y.o. Born in Europe, moved to NA, now back to Europe.

the situation got extreme last night, and I am looking for advice. I've gotten a lot more comfortable with the idea of self-harm, and as scary as that used to be in the past, I'm not afraid of it now.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, a few months ago I accepted a job offer (quite unrelated to my field) my mom made me so I can return to Europe (from NA where I've been for the past 12 years). I've always had arguments with my mother, and in order for you to understand why, I'll just direct you to [/r/raisedbynarcissists/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/) as it's a textbook case. also, the reason I was in NA was part of her desires for my future (which I accepted because I didn't know better).

second element important here is that it's very difficult for me to make myself do things I don't like, and it's even worse around my mother who has been making me do things I don't like for a large part of my life. Being uncomfortable drains me excessively, and unpleasant tasks take me a lot longer to do, I'm not fully focusing on them, and not expressing my full potential on them. I need psychologically fitting jobs. Around my mother I still feel like a child, while at my past jobs I felt more like my own person (I even got a raise and lots of praise).

my work at this job has been really sloppy, didn't manage to organise myself properly, I'm incredibly demotivated to do the required work... and my mom doesn't recognise any mental health issues related to the relationship between me and her. I suspect depression related to my relationship with her has been getting a lot stronger since we've started spending more time together these past months.

Yesterday she got extremely upset, started yelling, we argued for the best part of the day about my sloppy work, then called me at midnight to yell more, sent me a long and strongly worded email about how terrible I am as a person... and that I'm not a kid anymore and have to take more responsibility for myself. This was not the first time we argued, it's been consistent maybe once a month since September. I never should have accepted her offer.  
I've been fine away from her for so many years, I have a girlfriend who I want to bring here and start a life with.

My status in this country (middle of Europe) here depends on this job for now. I've started applying for other jobs (which are also more relevant to my field), but it's a long process. I don't have anything much tying me to NA, so if I return there I won't have an income, nor a place to stay. If I go back to my native country (Eastern Europe) I only have my father who isn't in the best situation either. Furthermore, I can't bring my girlfriend as she doesn't speak the language and life there isn't the best.

I'm depending on my mother again, and it's an extremely unpleasant experience. This led me to consider suicide last night (didn't tell anyone close about this yet). On the other hand, I promised my girlfriend I would do my best to hang on and get through this. I'm really emotionally numb now, and I have lots of work to do...

I want to say though, my mother works a lot, she has large amounts of energy, and likes to help out people around her. However, her situation in life is currently very stressful (I don't want to say why) and I recognise that. Me being here isn't helping her, and I've created more stress for her instead of helping. I can't live in her environment, and I generally don't get along with her due to our strong personality clashes; yet we still love each other because you don't choose your family. I recognise that I need to work on my discipline and also to generally be less self-sabotaging. My mind is really foggy. I'm going to pick myself up now.

Thank you for reading this far, and I apologise if I broke any guidelines or rules, I just wanted to release this from my system.",05Dec2019,1

I was a shit granddaughter. I didn’t cry. My mum is being treated for breast cancer right now. I didn’t cry. 
I feel like I haven’t achieved enough in my life. I don’t do anything but distract myself through devices. My self confidence couldn’t be lower.

94,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 
Im currently in my last semester of university and working two jobs. 
I love my jobs and I love what I’m studying but still everything has become a struggle for the past few months. 
I should have started with my master thesis months ago but can’t motivate myself and if I feel motivated once in a blue moon I feel overwhelmed by micro managing two jobs, writing it and attending lectures, so in the end I just give up and do nothing. 
Although I love what I’m doing I did the bare minimum to keep me financially stable and feel kind of accomplished for the past months. 

I get up early and I don’t feel motivated -  I just feel pressured to do something. And at the end of the day I feel guilty for not doing anything. Wake up again and repeat. 

My grades are good, my bachelor thesis was good and I’m told I’m doing a good job at work. I’d consider everything going well and I’m happy that I even landed these jobs. I also got married recently and I’m generally happy. But fuck....if there was a button to press and make myself just not exist anymore, no one remembering me, my wife, mom and friends not being sad because I didn’t even exist in the first place...I’d gladly press it. 
And I don’t know why I feel this way. 
I see other people happily working their asses off and studying way more challenging things than me and working way more hours than me. And then I see myself and how sometimes buying groceries and cooking something makes me feel accomplished instead of lazy because at the end of the day at least did something instead of nothing.

I feel like I have everything going for me - could finally be done with university in a semester and I could probably land a job afterwards. What I’m doing and what I’m close to accomplishing is my dream and now all of a sudden I don’t feel motivated anymore and would love to just fade out of existence.

Although I should go and search for medical help, there’re no private psychiatrist in my town. There’s just a hospital and I heard so many bad things about system and doctors in my country, so I don’t trust them at all and I’m scared to go there 
So somehow I’m going to find a way to get help

The whole situation is so weird to me, I always considered that I’m not that sick, I was so good at masking it and pretending somebody else, I don’t even know who I am right now, because I am who I am only with myself. But what I do alone is only watch films/YouTube or read books and listen to music
I’m so tired and confused

I’m also going on a 2 day trip with my friends and I think I will pretend that everything’s ok as always, although I don’t feel like having fun at all.

97,"There are some tips if you feel you feel anxious or depressed:

1. Listen to instrumental version of pop songs:
You can also listen just original instrumentals but when you know a song from before and listen to its instrumental version, your brain doesn't has to stretch too much out of its comfort zone and you feel calmer.

2. Don't listen to motivational podcasts/ YouTubers/ read motivational books- When we feel deep in the muck, our instinct is to listen to a pep talk but more often than inspiring us, it makes us feel bad about ourselves and we grow irritable and get pulled into the spiral of self loathing. Instead I would recommend to listen Live Awake podcast by Sarah Blondin/ or listen to An Autumn village guided meditation by Honest Guys on YouTube.

3. The question of books- Some people feel better when they are pulled to a fantasy book with elaborate world building to deal with anxiety, but honestly, when I feel anxious, I find it too difficult to focus on the words in the book. You can read Paulo Coelho's more reflective works like Brida, By River Piedra I sat down and wept (though I would recommend to stay away from Alchemist, because its terribly cliched motivational story which can be too upbeat). You can also read poetry or short stories.

4. Doodle- Doodling is very relaxing and calming and it also helps to dissipate some of your anxious energy.

5. Journal- Write a Dear John letter to life or god or whoever you want.

6. Walk- Walking in fresh air can be very relaxing.",05Dec2019,1

I could make a friend. All of the ways of meeting people assume you do not have social anxiety. I am fine around a few people at a time, but other than for my weekly society I avoid large groups as much as possible. I am never far from people my age but I have no way of reaching them",05Dec2019,1

due to my anxiety I can barely speak to the young people and other volunteers. even in one on one interactions with people I know, I start having trouble breathing and my heart races and I have a lot of negative thoughts, such as ""I don't want to talk about myself"" since I live a very inactive life and don't have much to talk about. I don't feel remotely close to anyone there. nobody spends time together outwith the volunteering, so it's essentially a colleague-type relationship. they're very supportive when I tell them I'm struggling, though since I don't know how to calm down they also don't know what to do. the volunteers treat me like one of the young people and coddle me. there's usually a 5:1 ratio of volunteers to teens so I feel I'm not needed.

She treathened with suicide when my brother (when he was a kid) would  want to leave earlier than she wanted him to. She gets frequently throws temper tantrums and has generally a short temper (she also takes absolutely everything as a personal attack)
What also strikes me as odd is that my father barely ever talked about his childhood. What i know for sure though, is that when my mom started to date him during college he would selfharm by putting out cigarettes in his palms and also frequently throw temper tantrums where he usually breaks everything in his surroundings. He still does that sometimes but its no longer than extreme as is used to be (sometimes he still completely wrecks his laptop or phone tho)

I just don’t know what to do . Anytime failure occurs in my life by me I get so upset &amp; just feel like shit for days on end &amp; that makes me more of a passive person I guess .

110,"I missed a few group meetings because I really struggle with december. Everyone has their reasons for it being hard but December 2019 is particularly tough for me. The juxtaposition of being extremely festive ( I love Christmas) combined with being emotionally drained because of events that happened in december is really fatiguing and confusing. 

The first ones I missed I contacted my PhD supervisor and told her I was sick. I didn't give a reason for the most recent one I missed. She has now contacted me asking if I am okay... 

I just don't know whether I should mention that this December is a hard month for me. she has no idea I am going to therapy. I'm not sure if I want it known. I am also worried she will think I shouldn't have started a PhD while I have these underlying problems and I am not a good candidate and she will regret taking me on. I don't know what is the professional thing to do:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Tell my supervisor why I missed the meeting, thereby offering a valid reason why I am checked out this month HOWEVER I will be revealing personal information about myself that most of my friends don't even know which I'm not entirely comfortable with
2. Make up some excuse about the reason I missed the meetings, tell her I am fine and have her think that I am a bit crap at my job and not dedicated, but then I don't have to share information about myself.

111,"I’ve had worsening major depression since I was 16 (I’m 21 now). It’s something I never learn to live with and it seems like it gets harder every single day. I’ve tried therapy multiple times, but’s it’s really never worked out for me. I’ve tried what seems like every medication in the pharmacy, as well as some pretty aggressive treatments. Nothing has made any profound difference. 

I started Uni after high school and it’s been very hard to keep up with my work because of how I feel. Now I’m in a different country studying abroad, something that has been my dream for as long as I can remember. I’ve been very interested in language all my life and I have a foreign language major, so it’s really a great opportunity for me to be here living in my target language. The thing is: Even though I’m here doing what I know I love, I feel I can’t enjoy it.

I’m sure most people are familiar with the typical effects of depression. Reduced drive, loss of interest, negative thoughts, insomnia, cognitive slowness, etc. etc.

I know that I need to help myself by getting back into therapy and back to a doctor, something I’ve really slacked on since arriving in my new Uni town, but there’s a few things I feel like I just need to learn to change by myself. Mainly my problems with constant negativity, complete loss of interest in my hobbies, and little to no motivation to complete otherwise simple tasks.

That being said, my question for this subreddit is: 

Do you have any tips or tricks for dealing with - 
A) Constant negativity? Everything feels like a loss to me, even things that could be considered achievements or positive are all always negative. I almost feel like my mind is incapable of seeing anything in a positive light anymore. It leaves me worrying constantly about everything I did wrong throughout the day and never thinking about anything I did right. And MAN is it hard to convince myself otherwise!
B) Loss of interest in old hobbies? I used to play bass guitar everyday, I sang, I was in a band with some friends. I haven’t touched it in years. I used to be such a language nerd and I know to some degree I still am, but I just can never find the motivation to keep learning like I used to, I don’t read books anymore, I don’t do translation for fun anymore. I know deep down it’s something I still love, but I can’t bring myself to do any of it anymore and it really has an extreme negative effect on me.
C) Little to no motivation to do simple tasks? It’s hard to do anything, no matter how trivial. I rarely do simple homework, I can’t bring myself to cook sometimes and just don’t eat, I have trouble cleaning up and keeping things clean, keeping up with my hygiene is even a struggle. This is not who I am at all, I have never been this lazy or inattentive to my personal hygiene and health. I just feel like without even thinking about it now I ignore my health and hygiene entirely. It’s gross and I hate it, but it’s just difficult to tell myself I need to do and just do it. 

If you do have any personal experiences or tips you could add, I’d be glad to hear anything, thanks for reading, I know it was pretty long-winded!",05Dec2019,1

114,"Didn't know where else to post this. I hope someone can help me.

So I've been getting help about 6 months now. I have a psychiatrist who's great, a counsellor at my Uni's counselling office, and until a few weeks ago a therapist, who bailed on me though. For context, I'm also a psychology student who's pretty far in her studies, so I know my way around the mental health system.

So, I'm actually pretty sure I have complex PTSD. My childhood was, simply put, so horrifying that me telling my therapist about made her speechless, and she's been in the profession for decades. I've nearly died a couple of times, was bullied at school and escaped rape a couple of times. I tick all the boxes for diagnosis criteria. I also take great care to be open to my care team and let them know all the symptoms I notice.

But for some reason, all three of them don't acknowledge the trauma at all. Mostly the therapist, but she bailed. They tell me I have severe MDD and a social phobia, but have difficulty explaining my severe dissocative symptoms, my crazy nightmares or my hypervigilance. I just don't understand. Yes, visual flashbacks are pretty rare for me, but I do have auditive and emotional flashbacks frequently. I also suffer from pretty tough somatization (chronic headaches, autoimmune disease etc.)

119,"So, I have had a super rough year. My cat of 20 years passed away, my nan passed away a few weeks ago, I've had numerous health issues to do with asthma causing me to be weak and less able which then has caused further health issues. Me and my partner of soon to be 4 years went through a pretty rough spot. Due to all this I have had to take quite a number of sick days and personal days but also work from home.

My health has gotten better slowly, and me and my partner are in a better place now.  Surprisingly my depression is getting better but my anxiety is getting worse, because now I'm not numb.

 The director of my workplace at 23:30 last night emailed me with a meeting entitled ""Nathan catch-up"" with my boss, a senior developer, herself and the CTO. When I read the email this morning I was shaking and on the verge of crying. I spoke to my boss this morning who didnt know what the meeting was for and has enquired with the director. This was a few hours ago, no update since.

The company is aware of both my mental health and physical health problems but to spring this meeting without context, on the day of our Christmas party, has left me shaken, scared and clueless on what to do or what's going on and not wanting to participate in christmas festivities.

Any advice or kind words would be very much appreciated.

P.S. this is long and it could be all over the place but hopefully, you'll understand...

On December 8th, 2012, I was hit by a car traveling 58-62mph while on foot... It broke my left femur, my C4 (small bone connecting the top of the spinal cord) and neck, fractured my skull, lower spine, punctured two arteries (femoral and carotid), internal bleeding, swelling of the brain, and damage to the left temporal lobe.

I lost 60% of my blood before the arrival of the ambulance and the doctors all told my family that I only had a 2% chance of survival. I wasn't expected to survive the night, I did.

Long before the injury, I dealt with repressed emotions and feelings, isolation, ostracism and physical assault from family members. 
I thought I had done well through my teenage years, hiding it and having never really thought and felt like I do now.
The injury and damage to the brain were like the straws that broke the camel's back.

I came out of my coma in January (I spent the month of Dec in that state) with absolutely no memory of the year, 2012. And immediately began freaking out. My entire body was in pain and I didn't know why, nobody would tell me anything and my anxiety was rapidly increasing.

The years after I left the hospital have not been kind to me... My mental state has slowly crumbled, I'm very suicidal with quite a few issues that continue to make life hard.

My issues are as followed...

Physical: 
•Traumatic Brain Injury 
•Left Temporal Lobe; 
The temporal lobes are believed to play an important role in processing affect/emotions, language, and certain aspects of visual perception. The dominant temporal lobe, which is the left side in most people, is involved in understanding language and learning and remembering verbal information. 

°Difficulty in understanding spoken words

°Disturbance with selective attention to what we see and hear

°Difficulty with identification and categorization of objects

°Difficulty learning and retaining new information

°Impaired factual and long-term memory

°Persistent talking

°Difficulty in recognizing faces (Prosopagnosia)

°Increased or decreased interest in sexual behavior

°Emotional disturbance (e.g. Aggressive behavior)

Left leg: 
•Nerve damage (inner thigh, back of the knee, calf), limited range of motion in the left knee &amp; hip, titanium metal rod inside left Femur (screws in knee + hip)

Mental:
•PTSD
•OCD
•Mental instability
•Short term memory loss
•Manic Depression Disorder
•Mania
•Suicidal thoughts and tendencies.
•Psychosis
(There are more but I can't remember everything.)

Because of my Psychosis, I have trouble trusting others, I struggle with letting people help me (my parents are big on reminding me of everything they've done for me when I can't help them, I.e paying back help.)
My depression is nasty for me as it really has dampened my life. I'll go weeks without cleaning my home, days without food, snap at any moment and hurt myself. I avoid others now as to not burden them, often tell people negative things to either push them away or see who's serious.
I have auditory and visual hallucinations and suffer from insomnia now as well.

Each year for me seems more difficult than the last and every time I try, it seems like a wasted effort because I'm inevitably set back further. I've almost killed myself twice this year, once before my injury and once 2 years after. I'm losing my drive to keep fighting. I'm often so tired, physically and mentally, I just want it all to go away but sometimes, I'm not sure I want to leave this life of pain. 7 years in the darkness, it's almost all I know now.

I tell myself that I know I'm going to kill myself one day... I just don't know when. Then I'll pray each night for death and each day I say I don't wanna die, I just want the pain to end. I was planning to end it this Sunday, (December 8th) or on my birthday (July 5th). I feel that those would be the best times to leave.

Honestly, if you made it this far, I don't know what I hope to gain by posting this. I don't believe it's worth posting and I'm sure none of the ones who comment actually care since I because I have no self-worth, no passion anymore and nothing really driving me to try...but I was recommended to post this. I want to know I'm not alone in my suffering and if someone is suffering similarly to me, how do you handle it?",05Dec2019,1

I'm a 19 year old boy, man? Whatever you wanna call it. And I serve in the Israeli army (it's compulsory, I didn't choose to serve, they forced me to) for the past 7 months I have been feeling mentally weak, I requested a meeting with a psychologic, but they said it would take 2 weeks until the request gets approved so I eventually cancelled it. Ever since then, I've been trying to seek help everywhere. I don't know what's wrong with me. My family is healthy and well, they love me and they treat me good, I have good friends that also care about me, I have a girlfriend that loves me as well. But I always just end up in a black loop of pain and loneliness, it's like I'm feeling empty all the time although I lack nothing. Aside of money. 

My girlfriend, she confuses me. One time I feel like she loves me, and the other she makes it look like she doesn't care about me at all. Whenever I get upset over the smallest thing she gets all fuzzed up and leaves me alone. She once told me to deal with my pain on my own and I can't forgive her since then, I know it doesn't sound anything painful but when you hear it from someone so close to you someone who made you feel safe it hurts like hell it crushes the bones. I don't know what happened to her. I did my best to keep her and everyone else close to me happy. But I somehow end up getting treated like absolute shit and stuck sleepless for days. I haven't slept for 2 days and my brain and bones hurt and I can't find any solution for this. Like please I beg god to help me stop the pain but nothing helps. I don't wanna die - I simply wanna know what's wrong with me and why am I always down to my knees even though the stuff that are affecting me are just very small stuff that none can even care about aside of me.

One more thing is life. I'm being so pessimistic. Like, I picture myself being a millionare but it doesn't make me excited or anything. The sentece ""what's my purpose?"" Keeps roaming around my head and it hurts me so much that I can't sleep nights because of it. 

I tried smoking, it didn't help. I tried getting drunk, it was just a temporarily escape. I can't acquire sleeping pills so I at least run away from reality - but even if I do, the painful reality runs after me to my dreams. I get sleep paralysis, I dream of my girlfriend hurting me, I dream of everything around me being so black and so full of pain and just fucked up pictures. Please. Life is eating me up alive. The only thing that truly helps is my meme page that I made on Instagram - but still, it helps for max 10 minutes then my stupid dark angels start poking my bones with needles again.

idk how to explain this without it sounding really stupid to me but basically im super super super paranoid and scared of having any illness that can kill me BUT its specifically related to hearts. i have a complete aversion to hearts in general as an organ im pretty sure its a phobia or something but whenever i hear a heartbeat sound i physically get triggered into a spiral of thinking theirs something wrong with me and im going to die. i cant lay on one side of my body because if i do ill have a panic attack if i hear it and if roll over on that side of my body in my sleep ill wake up in a panic

i cant deal with hearing it/feeling it at all it really sets me off. im super scared that im gonna have a heart attack or something or a blood clot or a stroke or anything and ill just die from it. im a bit the same with throwing up my entire thought process goes to ill choke on it or something.

i literally OBSESS over this for the rest of the day when something triggers it and i cant stop thinking about how im gonna die and any ache i have in my body at all is like Oh fuck thats it im dead now. literally i obsess and cant think of anything else i struggle to even sleep at night

i guess an example about how bad it is is that i Told my mum my arm was feeling numb one day THREE YEARS ago and she said to me joking “maybe you had a stroke” and to this day i think about her saying that every single day of my life and my arm STILL feels numb 

its literally becoming so bad and i dont know why? also irrelevant but i thought my drinks were poisoned last week so apparently in a dissociate state i bought a ton of Healthy drinks which is a bit strange of me but ok

My parents are constantly telling me to stop talking with myself. But I can't control. I talk with myself the entire day, but I don't realize it. I don't pay attention to what is going on in real life when doing it. When someone interrupts I realize it and I feel embarrassed. Usually I just whisper, but sometimes, especially when I walk in public, I talk loudly. So I sad to myself: ""I will realize it when it will happen again."" And I actually did it few times. But the thing that worries me is that it looks like a dialogue sometimes. I don't say, for example ""it looks good, I will try it,"" but I say ""it looks good, you should try it."" I say ""you,"" it's like I'm talking to someone else. And then I say ""no, I don't think I will try it."" And I do it for hours when I have free time.

I hate waking up to a new day, I don’t like being alive. Yes, I do have occasional moments of joy and fun, but 97% of the time I’m just suffering.

I love my parents but they aren’t good parents to me. I feel like I’m constantly being invalidated and told that I’m the problem. I would kill to have a good relationship but they don’t notice how hard I’m trying to be pleasant and friendly towards them and instead see it another way.

My friends care about me, but I have a few people going out of their way to make me unhappy. I recently fed into these two girls and I’m not proud how I responded, but they torment me every day to the point where I feel afraid of being near them as they are just so unbearable. It’s fun to them. They laugh when I do simple things.

I feel like I’m just bearing with it, going through the motions. Like, I don’t seek the joy of being alive. I haven’t found someone who loves being with me, I’m always the one to start plans or conversation and I’m so sick of it. I just really feel like I’m in this pit.

When I go see my doctor, they call my name and it’s so weird I don’t feel connected to it anymore. Yes, I know it’s my name at birth, and yes I respond. But I don’t ever want to respond, I truly don’t feel like myself anymore just a entirely different person.

I rarely go outside my house (I’m home schooled) and I can’t go to the gym, I’m too scared to try to get a job, and when my boyfriend is over I constantly try to cover my body with blankets or cover my face with my T-shirt. All of this has caused me to become depressed and i have gained 70 pounds in the last 2 years, which just makes me hate myself more.

I wasn’t always this insecure but my parents are perfectionist and I’m the only child and they always correct me for everything that I do making me feel like I’m useless and my boyfriend cheated on me emotionally and compared me to a girl who was so much prettier almost 3 years ago.

136,"My main issue is I totally take things to heart that upset me and I can’t regulate my reactions to it. Issues I’ve gone through like racism, school bullying/exclusion, trauma etc. And although I no longer really “go through it” ANYTIME I see the issue brought up or reminded of it I get distressed, depressed and suicidal.

I guess I used to cope because I used to be highly confident in my abilities and I genuinely believed that by the time I died, I would have done something influential regarding social justice changes in the world. Once I graduated school, I had my dreams crushed. So I kinda lost my only coping method.

So now I’m stuck in a paradox where I: get reminded of a cruel reality I can’t change &gt; reminds me of my past, or things happening in the present &gt; I now know I can’t do anything to remedy or fix it and I’m stuck in a world full of shit essentially &gt; get into emotional distress &gt; see no solution or effective coping mechanism &gt; get suicidal &gt; eventually calm down (usually by sleeping/oversleeping) &gt; REPEAT

Any form of conflict with somebody will trigger the same cycle. Even friendly debates trigger me into feeling depressed. No idea why.

138,"Don't judge me for this. Recently I've been trying to befriend my ex again because despite our break-up we were really good friends for a while. Over the years I've become very sensitive. Not being able to handle criticism, insults, etc. Last night we went out to eat and normally he's very tactless. He doesn't know what to say out of his mouth. I was wearing a Victoria Secrete sweatshirt and he was shocked I was. He stated it was because he thought I was normally ""bland"". Mind you, he's extremely materialistic. The type of person who would rather spend $50 on a white polo T-shirt over a $6 dollar one at Walmart all because of it's name brand. Says Raman noodles are for poor people and refuses to eat them. Judges people if they're not doing as well as him or better and look down on them. He barely believes in mental health and thinks I shouldn't be taking medication for my bipolar depression. He thinks there's a natural remedy for it or something and I can do better without it.  It's the meds that make me stable. Without them, I would be an entire mess in the hospital again.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I'm so upset about this is because he doesn't know how hard it's been to fight my depression and how long I've been dealing with it. It's not something that will just go away on its own. It's a constant battle I have to endure. I've spent years in and out of the hospital, trying to find the right medication and dealing with being unemployed because of it. Of course, I'm not going to be further along than he assumed I would be.

so the thing is, my life has been pretty shit for a while now, but i always managed to punch through somehow. my grades were good, i had friends, that kept me alive and made life liveable. but like around 1 year ago this all fell apart. i lost more than half of my friends, now in 2019 even more, my grades are absolutely terrible and i dont know what to do anymore. i hate everything about myself, every night i just want to end it all. i never wanted to exist in the first place. ive been pretty suicidal for some time now, gone through therapy (still am now) and a mental clinic that i stayed 8 weeks in. this helped for a short time only. im always gonna be without a friend that i can trust, a lover, or a body that i feel comfortable in. i look like shit already, i have scars all over my arms which look really fucking disgusting, i dont care about my appearance at all anymore and its noticeable. im just so done, i hate myself and i want to kill myself more than anything. i dont know how i can ever be happy. i cant take this anymore, but i also dont want to hurt the few people that care about me. i sometimes wish i wouldnt play an important part in anyone's life, so i can just leave and no one would care, so no one is hurt through it. my suicide would solve everything, i dont see many reasons why i shouldnt do it. 
on a lot of days that i felt happy, i feel much worse at night. i feel guilty for being happy, because i dont think i actually deserve it. i want to stop self-harming but every day im so so close to doing it again. i see no way out and i dont know what to do except kill myself.",05Dec2019,1
142,"oh boy  
i dont even know where to begin  
How about   
we explain all the context, that way we dont ramble,   
I have ADHD, mild OCD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, possibly DID, not going to say I do until a Doctor does,  
Alrighty,  lets start with a few months back  
Around may of 2019, I felt like something was watching me, and that something was controlling me, at one point about a day after it started, I was sitting in my bed crying and begging this other voice in my head to stop telling me to kill myself,  after a few days it went away, but I did attempt to drown myself in july, Im now realizing just how fucking much i have to explain, for one, I have no friends in real life, none, havent had any since I was about 13, and every single ""friend"" ive had has done something to screw me over, my top row of teeth are crooked because a ""friend"" I had when I was about 5, just decided to fucking punch me, literally for no reason, didnt even say anything, I can give more examples, but I think you get the picture, So, for a few years, my only friends were xbox friends, had some hella fun, but then I found discord, and it truly changed me, most likely for better and worse. So, I had a ""girlfriend"" through discord for about 4 months, but wouldnt you know it, the long distance was getting to her, it was so bad that we talked about once every two weeks, I was so lonely, so empty, I just wanted to feel wanted, in any way, so I had some fun with a guy I knew on discord. and that was that, I told her like I should have, And it was over, kept trying to find someone, anyone to fill in the void, but no one truly could. So another thing, is a month ago about, a girl on discord, lets call her Chloe, well I talked to her for about an hour one day, and it was fun, found out she had scizofrenia, and then every time she wanted to talk again, I just kind of ignored it, dont know why, just didnt want to talk, she was nice, I just didnt want to, she was being bullied in some servers, then a few months later I find out she killed herself, so to say it effected me is an understaitment, I still think about her usually every day, even if i didnt know her, I still talked to her, she left an impact on me, told me about a guy named Terry A Davis, a guy who also had the same Mental Disorders as her, he died back in 2018, killed himself, but he was a fucking funny guy, defo insane and crazy, but funny. aaaaaaaaaaaaa. anyway, moving on, shit has just been hitting me more and more, I havent even mentioned the sexual abuse I got from my dad from about 6-8, I dont remember if he ever, ya know, went all the way with it, but I do remember touching, and just some really fucked up things, ive been around people who argue all my life, and I cant really remember much of my childhood besides arguing and yelling, so, the past few weeks, its seemed like that other voice, well, I named him William a long time ago, but it seems as though there is another, one who just cries, all the time, Michael is his name, I dont even want to say this because its so pathetic, but whenever it feels like Michael is crying, which thus makes me cry a bit, I just rub my shoulder to try and calm him down, and it works. Im really really in need of some help, but we are already down the rabit hole, lets go deeper, from what I can gather, Michael is afraid of William, and yesterday, when my family went out for a bit, and I had the house to myself, im not going to say what, but something triggered Michael to show up, to the point that I went into my closet, and just kept testing if the bar in it could support my weight, eventually I grabbed the belt i keep on the floor in there, and just kept crying, then I grabbed a stool, stood on it, and got right to putting the belt around my neck, but all I did was stand there, I got down, and put everything away, then just laid down on my bed and cried, like truly cried, i say truly because i usually cry quietly, dont know why, but if i cry like a normal person does, its usually when Michael is showing up, after a while, i cant exactly remember what caused the switch, William took over, and thats when the hour of William telling me to kill myself because I am worthless, dont matter to anyone, and everything else you can think of to me, we got a razor blade, and cut my left arm, lots of blood, eventually (he? we? me?) put some death metal on, and started head banging, which i never do, i listed to death, and heavy metal every once in a while, but i never head bang, im to self concious to head bang in my own room, no i am not kidding, anyway, we ate some food, then grabbed the old ass flip knife, and he just kept telling me to stab myself, right in my gut, over and over again. We actually recorded a message just in case we forgot what happened, eventually after cutting our arm some more, changing shirts, eating some more, and more constant telling me to kill myself, i started crying uncontrollably, and then William left, i started watching tv, fell asleep, and woke up to my family coming home, then fell asleep until about 10 pm, and ive been up since, its currently 11:53 am, my sleeping schedule has been fucked for more than a week, but uh, i think thats just about what i wanted to vent about

So, how do I know whether I should ask for help or it's just me being sad. I feel like it's more philosophical than psychological though. It would feel like nothing and if I ccould ask for anything my wish would be physician assisted suicide. I have a really deep desire to be euthanized.

146," I have this mental issue that I never dared to talk about with anyone out there. The reason, why I'm doing this right now, writing it down, is because I'm increasingly getting insecure, paranoid, and I really that one day I will snap and do something I will regret.

So, I get a feeling once in a while, a feeling that something's wrong with the world, or that I'm not really who I am. Hard to describe a bit. Tell you what, I had, just recently a series of new feelings that almost, to some extent, cost me my sanity and turned me legit crazy. See, not a long time ago, I started having some very vivid dreams. When I say vivid, I mean literally indistinguishable from reality. Oh, and they tend to be very, very damn long, even feeling like days or even weeks. When I would wake up, I simply wouldn't believe it was all a dream. I wouldn't believe that all those people weren't real, my moments with, what we had talked about, and that I wasn't who I thought I was. From that point onward, dreams remained equally vivid, always having a story, a plot to drive them, characters of their own, and heck, ever different main character each time, who I get to feel or simply be. As you can tell, this started to backfire into a really nasty disaster. I started getting suspicious of reality itself and all that it contains. I even started to think that, hell, I might be actually in a dream and that I have to die somehow to wake up. I would look at real people and wonder if they're actually real. I would just tease them, do things just to see if they'd react in a suspicious way, affirming my belief that it might just all be another silly long dream. This period in my life cost me a lot. It made me abandon many friends, my girlfriend and even eventually isolated myself and minimizing all interactions. I just had a gut feeling that it wasn't worth it, that they were fake, and I was wasting my time, feeding my imagination that will eventually wake me up to yet another surprise. In short, my perception of reality was completely screwed over by long memories from dreams, conflicting with memories of real life.

I was not able, anymore, to tell between the dream world and reality and I would cry my soul out, looking at myself in the mirror and asking myself:

""What is going on!?"" ""Why are you like this?""

Well, you must be reading all of this, descending down these lines, you'd almost ask: How were you such an idiot to think like that and be fooled? I don't know how to reply to that, because it all seemed like a perfect story for me to believe in. I was locked in a situation that crippled my ability to be normally conscious. To tell between what was real and what was not. I couldn't do anything about it as I was a slave to my own imagination that seemed so real, Gosh, I just knew it for sure.

Yet, actually, a recent job started to keep me a little busier, and the fact that I had exams at the university kinda disallowed me to have my normal sleep schedule. Therefore, dreaming less, be confused less, getting more busy with life...the circumstances were just perfect to restore what was left of my sanity and allow me to actually look back and wonder, what the fucking hell was I thinking about and to what extent my mind played tricks on me. Despite getting over it, it's still here, I can still feel it, but somehow, I'm learning to live with it...

It was a scary realization that reality is somewhat a product of my mind and that if my mind were to malfunction, my perception of reality would also malfunction.

Would you consider this as DPDR (depersonalization/derealization disorder)? Because based on my online searches, that is what I suspect I had, or still having to a minor extent.

And if so, how do I deal with it?",05Dec2019,1
148,"if you failed to kill yourself, you are incompotent. just hang yourself",05Dec2019,1
149,"So yesterday I had pulled out a rope to hang myself, and also overdose. I opened the bottle, put it to my mouth, let the pills fall, then stopped, and called a trans crisis line. They instructed me to hide the pills and throw the rope away, I did, and they talked to me for almost 2 hours. I think they saved my life yesterday. 

Today, I feel depressed, but not suicidal. The crisis line gave me some resources that I need to follow up with, but I also recognize that yesterday I planned and set up my own death by getting the rope and pills. I had a thick rope that wouldn't break, and 120 15mg oxycodone pills I was going to swallow, then hang myself just to make sure I would really die. I planned on being a coward, and standing on a chair with the noose around my neck and letting the pills make me pass out so I wouldn't feel pain as I was hanging.

Today, I feel deeply ashamed of myself, and I don't want to go to inpatient, but I feel like I have to do something before I get back to that dark spot and maybe this next time I just do it. This has been slowly building for months now, from day dreaming about suicide, to thinking how best to do it, to getting the implements, to mock run, to actually wanting to actively kill myself. 

I don't know what to do, or who to talk to. My wife is so angry at me for having these issues, she loves me, but treats me like I am at fault for something and likes to sweep things under the rug.

Lately it's been getting worse. I've started getting frustrated with everything and only really enjoy fictional worlds. I'm getting in more arguments with people but I'm able to act it off as I'm perfectly happy and fine around my family and people in general. I want to tell my friends or at least one but I dont know how. I'm 13f and skipped off school for today and yesterday just thinking about it. Some of my friends are quite toxic but Its pretty much impossible to cut contact with them due to us having the same classes and friend group. There are few friends i trust fully but some may not be able to handle it.

151,"Sort of throwaway account. I (21F) started self harming again. It has been about a year since I’ve cut and I’ve been on and off Prozac and citalopram for a couple of years. I was proud of myself for going almost a year without hurting myself and the scars I had on my leg were faded and completely healed. I never told anyone about it except my boyfriend (20). We moved out a year ago and he was a huge motivator for me. He would feel my scars and tell me they would get better and he was always there if I felt the urge to self harm so I never did. But recently it just feels innate and I feel like I can’t stop myself like my body is moving on it’s own and tearing itself apart. I haven’t been on my meds for a few months and really don’t want to get back on them. But it’s been hard to not have a day where I feel empty and alone and dissociated. 
I feel guilty for self harming and ashamed. I hide them from my boyfriend and it’s hard because we’ve always been comfortable around each other so we don’t wear clothes at home. But now all I do is cover up and get really uncomfortable and closed off if he gets close to touching where the scars are. We used to have a very healthy relationship/sex life and it’s like neither of those exist anymore because of me. I don’t know how to talk about it with him. Right now it seems like he’s angry at me because I reject his advances and I don’t know how he will take it knowing I’m self harming again or that I’m feeling like this again.

We went to the ER on Sunday because she was having stomach pains but we left because she was convinced the hospital was hacking her cell phone. Since then, she has reset her phone and has been changing all her passwords. At her therapist’s request yesterday we went to a hospital for a psych evaluation. She refused to sign any of the papers given to her and kept insisting that the blood pressure machine was a camera. This morning she had a doctors appointment to discuss her medications. He did not recommend any changes. She’s not willing to talk to anyone about what’s happening and she is sometimes insistent that her mother will try to forcibly commit her. She won’t talk to me about any of this and responds to any attempt to help her with hostility. Has anyone else been through something similar? Any advice on how to get her help when she insists she doesn’t need any?",05Dec2019,1
155,"I doubt the validity of my mental health issues because of my ability to deal with them with minimal outside resources, but then I wonder if that's because my standards for what I consider ""coping well"" with my mental health have been lowered after years of isolated struggling. I've been through some really rough times with my mental health, and honestly, on the whole I'm doing much better than in the past, but a combination of poor sleep, poor nutrition, a flu shot, a stressful counseling session, an unrelated health problem, and someone accidentally tripping and falling all over one of my C-PTSD triggers, has set me back mentally/emotionally quite a bit. 

And I look at how poorly I feel right now, and consider how I used to feel likes this for months at a time. I empathize with why I would've felt suicidal at those points. I'm not at that point now, especially since I know this is just the result of a perfect storm of a lot of coincidences that have temporarily made the right conditions for this to happen now. But I can definitely empathize with my younger suicidal self who had never felt that bad before, especially for such a prolonged time, and had no reason to know that it would ever end. 

But even in my worst points, with practically no support network, I still functioned...enough. I always feed myself (to some extent but when I don't it's because of an ED, not because of depression). I shower. I go to the things I said I was going to. I make myself get out of bed. When I'm hypomanic, I don't let myself go broke with purchases. I don't so much as drive over the speed limit. I can still rationally look at my situation and explain it to my therapist, and frame things in positive lights, and separate my thoughts from either my depression or mania. I keep working. I still take my BC, try to drink water, and exercise on days that I can. 

I'm grateful I can do these things, but it prevents me from ever reaching out, asking for help. And especially when I was younger...I look back now, I tell people the things I was doing, the things that were happening, and people look at me like something was clearly amiss. But even still, it was all so private, and the people who could see didn't want to bother with the responsibility of helping so they either avoided seeing or pretended not to. And I just kept things moving along. I did what I could, with what I had, and I guess it worked out, without much help. Now, the only help that I have is a really supportive boyfriend and a therapist, and I feel like if that's enough for me to manage all this pain, then clearly it must not be real--but at the same time, I can't imagine ever letting myself actually seek more help than I have already. Plus, maybe I'm not all that great at managing it, but I just got really good at not caring about the things that I can't do without help and I lowered my standards. I don't know. I'm sure others can relate to parts of this. I know we're not all struggling in the ways we would think we ""should be."" (whatever the heck that is).",05Dec2019,1

now skipping a lot of events, its been hard because of our mental issues but fucking hell i love her so much, she is my reason to get up, my reason to try to be better, she makes me excited about the future. but unfortunately when im not with her i feel so empty and i sometimes resent her i guess, i just spend every month waiting for that one week to see her.

she wants to break up with me, but she still loves me, but our relationship is too hard on her. 

she has been through a lot and she thinks that i keep disapointing her. i am eaten by anxiety, making any decision is hard for me. i have been followed by a psychiatrist and i most likely have borderline personality disorder. 

we will see each other one week at the end of the month. she just told me that after that, we are done.

163,"I’ve lived a normal life for the most part, grew up in the suburbs with both parents and 3 older brothers. Healthy upbringing other than the typical family arguments that would naturally occur. Nothing extreme or traumatizing. High school starts and I realize how hard it was for me to focus on anything, I’d read full pages of words and not recall anything I had just read. I was diagnosed with ADD at 14 and have been taking vyvanse since. I can focus easier now at 14, also more alert of my surroundings. Sorry if this becomes out of order/a rant, it’s the ADD in me. I was always a sensitive and anxious person growing up. 

In middle school I would have to come home early a few times every week or so because I was worried something would happen to my parents or pets and I constantly had a weight on my conscious that I couldn’t get rid of. I had 2 panic attacks in middle school that scarred me for years to come. I couldn’t sleepover at friends house because I was always worried something bad would happen to me or my family. 

High school came and something had clicked that helped me grow out of worrying so much about general things rather than substance that can be worried about. However I realized years after high school I had developed social anxiety in high school and had a really tough time talking to people, overthinking basic functions like walking, how I looked constantly, and other things most people don’t think of. Self esteem grew really low in high school. I had a few breakdowns throughout high school but it wasn’t until college when things got bad for me. College was fun, I enjoyed it for the most part. Drinking, parties, all the typical things. Senior year my girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me since we weren’t growing anywhere. It didn’t feel real for a while, especially because she was the one person I went to for a lot of my issues and she didn’t always give the best advice but she would listen and that helped. It was a clean breakup but my reaction to it wasn’t clean. I drank just about every night heavily for the entire last semester. I began self harming as well which I had done previously in early college but became worse my senior year. The pent up anxiety, social anxiety, depression I had dealt with since high school had all felt like it caught me at once at this point. I dealt with depression as well since high school due to reasons I can’t explain, random waves of days of sadness that would come and go. I thought of killing myself a few times my senior year and I’ve thought about it since. College ended and I came home where I remain today. I cleaned up, the breakup wasn’t fresh, I had support at home, my parents don’t drink anymore which helped with not having access to alcohol in the house unless I went out to get some which I didn’t really do. I lost weight, 35lbs over a few months. Started working in IT which I had majored in. Life felt like it was getting better. It was getting better. I still drank but it was only during recreational times with friends and never alone. 1 month ago, I don’t know what happened, well nothing happened. These thoughts came back. The prior relationship with my ex has been out of my mind, I hope she’s doing great. I’ve talked to a few girls since her but nothing serious enough to try to make a relationship. 1 month ago I just would get clouds in my head, I have a tough time having substantial conversations with people who aren’t my direct friends, I forget words mid sentence a lot and it makes me feel really dumb. Obvious words too. I begin to really just hate myself and having these thoughts of how I can’t do anything right, I truly can’t. Self worth is gone and still feels gone. I get home from work every day and sit in my room, eat dinner and go back to my room. Repeat. Every day. Began to self harm again and do everything I can to make myself feel worse(listen to depressing music, watch Ted talks on suicide). I don’t know what’s wrong with me. It’s like I want to feel better and get better but something is stopping me from doing so. I isolate a lot, from friends and family. I hate talking so much because I realize how dumb I sound that I would rather be by myself. This is my life at 22.",05Dec2019,1
164,"Because:  


1-What it really means is ""You're scaring the shit outta,get outta my face"" and that you have NO understanding of mental illness and that you don't want to learn about it/care to learn about it.  


2-Mental health professionals are NOT superheroes. They are NOT gods and goddesses. They CANNOT save the world/stop a nuclear war,etc.   


3-And personally,when people tell me to get help...they attach a insult with it(yeah,cyber-bulling people to get help,REAL nice of you!**/s).**  


4-Instead of going in-depth to tell a person WHY they're wrong,you'd rather dismiss them as ""crazy""(again,ZERO awareness of mental illness...people who do this are just being fucked up for no reason)  


And also,having your post history used as a stick to beat you over the head with doesn't help matters much at all.  


So,if people want to think that mental health professionals can save the world singlehandedly/just be assholes to you,then so be it.  


And if i am a crazy ass nigger for feeling what I feel,then fine. I'll own it. I'll be the bad guy then.  


In fact,I really wish I took up cutting a LONG time ago...it would've helped me so much.  


But,the shitty thing is the scars,but oh well,that can be covered up.  


Get help...I have gotten help before...  


Two shrinks,while they had their hearts in the right place,actually told me that they don't really know how to really help me(and one of them,I'm seeing now and I'm very happy with),and there was one that did not give one-fourth of a shit about my issues and made me feel WORSE.  


Shrinks...people love them so much,yet they can fuck you over and make you fell even shittier.  


And then there's my little North Korea problem:I can't even think about them without getting pissed the fuck off...I guess the tl;dr of it is,I don't really want death by Korean in my life...but if that's my fate,then fuck it,so be it.  


I'm just tired  and I'm done.

I was drinking regularly to get drunk. I was desperate to cut. I had hoped t of suicide, and when my friends begged me to get more help, I turned them away.

Thank you for being honest with me. Thank you for taking me in when life was dark. I am sorry I pushed and fought hard against getting help.

I hope I can rebuild some of what we had with the addition of healthier boundaries.

I miss our friendship, and I miss the security I had with you. I miss spending time together. I realize our relationship may not be as close as I would like it and that you may not want to contact with me. I now see more of my flaws and how I was toxic. I am working to fix these.

I'm 27 and a guy living in the UK. Probably since the age of about 17 or so ive had noticeable problems with anxiety, low self esteem, ruminative thinking and low moods etc etc. It was about that time I was toying with a lot of recreational drugs too, which could've been a trigger, who knows. I can't change the past.

Ever since that time I've just had an undercurrent of negative, toxic and anxious thoughts. For years it got worse and I just pinned it down to a complete lack of confidence and then would go out with friends on weekends and get really drunk to blot it out all out then rinse and repeat. But once I reached about the age of 22 I realised I had a serious problem and needed to face it head on.

I've been on sertraline since about this time. I'm currently on 100mg and I noticed a slight change in anxiety. I didn't obsess so much about awkward eye contact and stuff. But even now I still get bad days quite a lot. I can go half the time having minimal anxiety now, so I feel like I'm making progress. I've tried practising CBT a number of times and also been meditating for about 3 years. But my moods and thinking still just plummet out of nowhere sometimes.

I'm absolutely terrified to change medication as the increase in dosage on this medication made my social anxiety awful and work was unbearable. But I'm wondering if that is what its going to take now? Trying a different medication? I was hoping I could just learn to manage my thought patterns more and more and stay on this medication and eventually come off. Is that just impossible with some people?

I guess what I'm asking is that, am I just doomed to having to find the perfect medication and go through the hell of coming off this anti depressant and trying others til I find the right one. I dont even know what to expect from medication. Is it supposed to just completely block the ruminative thinking?",05Dec2019,1
183," Hi guys

When I get stressed out/anxious, I never really know it at the time and ""keep going"" or pushing and only really realize that I need to slow down or destress/take time out once my body gets sick (I internalize it).

So what happens is: I'll be carrying on thinking I'm fine and determined and then boom my body's health falls off a cliff (infections, muscle pains etc.) and in hindsight I was stressed/anxious and needed to stop and that's why I got sick.

Now the issue is, that I seem to miss the red flag or warning that it is happening at the time. My mental ""keep going"" attitude takes over and I seem to miss all the signs of being stressed/not okay until my body literally gives up

What I want to do is be able to recognise this BEFORE my health deteriorates, but I don't know how?

Has anyone experienced this before? Any tips would be greatly appreciated",05Dec2019,1

185,"Be aware this is most likely going to be a long post, I'll try to shorten as much i can as nobody has the time or effort to read sob stories. Lastly you'll have to excuse my appalling literature skills, but I feel I just need to get this out there, a disclosure as such. I don't have anybody close I'd feel confident saying this to and the anonymity of posting here makes this much less personal which I guess I'm more comfortable with. 

In most cases, when people are feeling down, they eat. If that were the case for me, I'm certain I'd be very overweight. Luckily for me however (I guess?), I go to the gym instead. Only problem is, It's all I ever do.

I've always been very aware of myself. My father always told me its never a good idea to think too much, though I feel upon hearing this has had very opposite effects. I've never had any meaningful conversations with anybody and only ever make small talk, I never make any personal connections with anyone, nor have I ever had any close friends, more like acquaintances, which has lead me to believe that I am uninteresting and nobody wants to talk to me. I constantly tell myself that I'm funny and like to be the center of attention but this is far from the truth. 

This has been made even more clear to me as I have recently moved out of home to begin my studies university. Upon hearing that university will be one of the best experiences of my lifetime I feel this is not the case. My flatmates have accepted me though I feel there's no further connection, the occasional ""hello"" and ""How are you?"" is as far as it gets. Due to these constant awkward and emotionally detached conversations I'm spending more and more time in my room, eating later as to not talk and avoid unwanted chat. I understand this is the complete opposite approach but I really tried earlier in the year hoping I could make a fresh start, but feel all I did was further solidify my doubts.

I am most comfortable in the gym. I enter a zone where all that's on my my mind is my music and lifting weight, for a brief hour or two I can rid of my negative thoughts, which as a result I'm spending all my time there. It's a 5 minute walk from my accommodation, and open almost all hours. I never go less than once a day and have recently being going upwards of 3 times a day even skipping class to do so. I have gained a lot of weight as muscle and am in quite good shape, but this has had no effect on my confidence as I have never been dissatisfied with my appearance but more my personality. If anything this has proven to me that looks aren't everything and I would rid all my athleticism and muscle just to be genuinely contempt with myself.

One last thing I have joined societies and done everything I can within reason to improve myself, but to no prevail. I never look forward to anything other than gym. But I really don't want to waste whats supposed to be the best time of my life lifting heavy objects and constantly feeling sorry for myself. I just don't know whats wrong with me and fear its only going to get worse. I've not been diagnosed with anything as I've never spoken about this.

tl:dr : lonely student goes to the gym an excessive amount of times to temporarily avoid social interaction and constant mental doubt.

I don't really see a reason for me making this post, I've not really made any point but after reading other peoples stories I guess why not. I feel almost pathetic making this as there are people with much worse difficulties who need much more attention than myself. I guess this is just a cry for attention.

187,"So for some context, I was diagnosed with ADHD in first grade &amp; have been on medication for that, anxiety &amp; depression since a young age. I was also in a physically abusive relationship which I thought was the cause of most of my anger that had gotten worse over the course of a few months. I started to think i was bipolar but didn't have insurance to see a doctor to speak with about it.

Recently, I was hospitalized for the first time due to me having another episode. (I flashed out at a very close friend of mine threatening to call the police on him if he didn't let me out of the car on the side of a highway. All because I was angry.) It was there that they told me that I was bipolar &amp; immediately started me on Latuda (I have since changed to something that works a little bit better for controlling my emotions). Ive always been a very angry person &amp; have never had much control over my emotions.

 Lately i have been having less anger flashes &amp; been feeling a little better. 
 
Dealing with my emotions is still a hard process for me. I feel an overwhelming calm sometimes that gives me anxiety. I still catch myself getting sad over things I normally wouldn't get upset over. I have also had one manic episode since being released from the hospital &amp; it lasted a week &amp; a half. Which is good for me personally because before i knew what a manic episode was, I had one a month. 

I'm learning that a healthier lifestyle will help me &amp; have since been making small changes to how I treat my body. Ive been trying to keep myself on a schedule &amp; gradually adding better habits to my daily life. I now meditate regularly &amp; take walks along with better eating habits. 

While i am making some progeess, I'm seeking advice on how to deal with it &amp; more information to help me learn about it.

Now I'm in my 2nd year of uni and suffer from severe OCD, depression and anxiety
I started self harming again and it's the only thing that makes me actually FEEL anything again, I feel so numb and dead inside.
I've talked to a professor of mine about the whole situation and she knows my story and she's so understanding and kind, I feel better immediately when she's around. She's a doctor btw and she gives psychology lectures so she knows a lot about mental illnesses.
I had a panic attack due to intense flashbacks the other day and I was (or rather am) having suicidal thoughts. A friend brought me into a relaxation room and I had a bad breakdown and like 30 seconds later said professor came in and they managed to calm me down.
And then she said one thing that makes me feel strange, she said that she can like calm me down and stuff now but she isn't trained enough to pull me out of this.
I've talked to my parents and boyfriend and none of them really understands how I feel and they can't really reach me in the darkness I am in, they're worried and they care but they just can't get an idea of what it looks like inside my mind.

I want to talk to her again so badly but I feel like I'm a burden and I don't want to annoy her so I guess I'll just be falling apart by myself :(

TL;DR my professor is the only one I feel understood by and I'm afraid of talking to her again because she said she's not trained enough for that kind of stuff


Edit: i forgot to mention that I have a therapist but I haven't seen her in to months, had to cancel my last appointment a month ago because I was sick and she's not free until next thursday
I'm also on fluoxetine 20mg",05Dec2019,1
189,"So,my massive problem(besides being a nigger..yeah) is that I'm a racist.  


I hate and fear Koreans(Two words:North Korea. And having negative experiences with Koreans in the past does not help.)   


And I'm particularly wary of China now(The mere fact that they can run us into the ground with the snap of the fingers).  


I'm seeing a shrink about this,but I doubt she'll be able to help me much...but I guess that the fear of death by Korean/Chinese is not something I want in my life.  


And when I try to get info on how NOT to be afraid of Korea..the following happens:  


1-I get told to get help(Before I wasn't,but now I am...but even my shrink is stumped.)  


2-I get cyberbullied(so being wrong is reason for toxicity...TIL/s)  


3-I get NOTHING.  


So,I wanna know:  


\-Can a mental health therapist really help when my problem is related to the state of the world?  


\-How can I get rid of this stupid racist nonsense that I'm on?  


\-Why is it that it's ok to be rude/toxic to people if they say something you don't like(North Korea is gonna blow the hell outta the U.S cuz trump,for example) and or they're wrong? I mean,I was never being rude or anything,so I am completly lost.  


\-How can I be less afraid of Koreans and Chinese?  


\-And again,why on earth do people have to make you feel like crap for being wrong? Because I have attracted several trolls(a couple even made accounts JUST to troll me! True story) and someone even said basically I deserve it..why? is being being honestly punishable by death?  


I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!!  


And to be very honest,the above has really broken me up,one time to the point where I literally wanted to stab myself.  


So tl;dr:Two major questions:  


1-How can I stop being a racist  


2-Why on earth having feelings/being wrong/talking about things people don't want to hear justifies cyberbulling and ridicule? I never knew there was a death penalty for being scared of North Korea/Trump/China!",05Dec2019,1
190,"I'm really wondering whether anyone else experiences or has experienced this.
When someone does something bad I get angry at the moment and it's clear to me why I'm angry, but I often internalize stuff especially at home with family and ignore it and then almost a couple of minutes later I forget what I'm angry about. It's weird and absolutely terrifying bc it always happens. It's like there is a block in my mind so when someone asks me why I'm mad, I just simply don't know/remember. Like I have a bad feeling in my gut, this internal ""instinct"" knowing someone did something bad but it's like I can't bring it into words. I feel like I got used to certain individuals in my life constantly overstepping my boundaries and I feel like I can't trust my own mind anymore. Anyone know what might be going on here?",05Dec2019,1
191,"As I sit here marinating in my isolated degeneracy I'm actually considering living. Yes you heard it right, living. I have no reason for living at all. My upbringing was textbook bad and I'm an absolute shell of a man with barely any skills to speak of, instead having issues weighing approx 3 tonnes on a good day.

Nonetheless I'm considering living, I'm considering giving up my default attitude. My default attitude is saying that I've been treated so poorly in my life, I barely have anything, I suck at almost everything and my mental wellbeing is about as stable a peg legged epileptic balancing on an anorexic zebra - so why should I try in life? Fuck life, I've been completely run over, I hate life, I don't care anymore, I have no motivation, so fuck it.

Default attitude, okay. Now I'm considering saying, fuck that attitude, I will instead try to face my fears and do the right thing and hope I get somewhere. Not with any motivation because I'm not motivated, not feeling well cause I feel crap, not with any social competence because what's that, only with the sheer hope that doing the right thing and not wallowing over my horrid existence can get me a life that I'd actually want to live.",05Dec2019,1
192,"I know it is not usually wise to trust tests on the internet but I have been somewhat struggled  mentally throughout my life and lately a lot more. In my search for some help I came across psychopathy, which I'm mildly familiar with but only within the narrow vein of serial killers. As I read more I got into primary and secondary psychopathy and a lot of what I read about secondary psychopathy resonated with me and I took a couple tests online, neither are the Hare psychopathy checklist. One test was from

https://psymed.info/psychopath-test 

And the other was from

https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/LSRP.php

On the first test I scored a 32 (doesnt say out of how much so I will assume 40 like the Hare checklist) and it recommends I speak with a professional to be evaluated.

On the second test there is a score for both primary psychopathy and secondary psychopathy with a scoring range of 1 (low) to 5 (high). I scored 2.3 on primary psychopathy and 4.1 on secondary psychopathy. The 2.1 was higher than 58% of people tested and the 4.1 was higher than 95.66% of people tested. There is a graph for plotting the 2 scored but I dont think I quite understood it. 

I guess Im asking if these tests seem legitimate and whether I should seek a psychiatrist?",05Dec2019,1
193,"After 2 years of being stable, I have an appointment for therapy next week. I've been really unstable for the past 2 months or so due to a wide array of issues. The past days have been difficult. 

Last time I had a psych, the first months were so hard. She kept asking me to tell her stories about my childhood abuse, and it triggered me all the time to the point that I couldn't leave my apartment unless it was for uni. I did eventually get better after a year of talk therapy. I've been getting panic attacks on a daily from just thinking about needing to explain my trauma again.

194,"My life is wacky. That's the most simple way to put it, wacky. My mother up and left us and got addicted to drugs when i was 5, leaving me and my younger brother to be raised by a woman who i'll call L. Fast forward to today, my mother has been dead (overdose) for the past three years, L hates and doesn't trust me because i told her my honest feelings(like how i feel im treated differently than her other three children), and she also doesn't believe in me, my dad and older brother don't believe in me, and i haven't heard from my grandmother in over a year. Not to mention that yesterday, in an attempt to make me feel like shit, L was saying that she was going to adopt me by suprise for my 18th birthday and told everyone about it.

I just don't understand why none of it affects me.
I'm not hurt by Ls words, or the fact that she, as the only mother figure ive ever had, doesn't trust, love, or believe in me. I'm not hurt by the fact that the only living parent i have left regrets giving life to me. I'm not hurt by the fact that my older brother can never keep his word and let me and my younger brother come see him. I'm not hurt by my grandmother, who has abused me for the first four years of my life, and attempts to continue that abuse to this day. None of it affects me.

So am i going crazy? Shouldn't I feel hurt by any of it? Please help, or atleast guide me to some related mental issues or something like that so i can understand what's going on in my head!

Thank you so much!",05Dec2019,1
195,"Not sure if this is the proper group but giving it a shot.  We are late twenties 

My boyfriend lies to me constantly because he is depressed.  I’ve only put two and two together after about 6 months that it’s likely depression.  We have dated almost 2 years.  He will work from home because he can’t leave the house but pretends to me that he went in.  Sounds buzzed when we talk on the phone nights he cancels on me.  I am thinking his coping mechanism is drinking but he denies it every time I ask.  Will break plans last minute.  I’ve asked him to go to counseling but he only went one time and said it was too expensive.  He said he has gone in the past so this is not new.  His mom committed suicide a few years back. 

Do I leave if he refuses or do I just accept that he lies when he is depressed? He says he lies because he just doesn’t want to hurt me.  He is a very supportive and kind partner however.  I believe his intentions are best but it makes me feel like I can’t trust him.

198,"Here is a blog post I recently wrote on my efforts to journal about my past and anxieties.  


"" It is Thursday afternoon, and I am trying to *open my heart*, as they say in Buddhism. Or something. I carefully follow the steps for breathing and meditation. Minutes pass. More minutes.

Nothing.  The shabby block of cement that goes where my heart should be does not  open. There are no tears, no cathartic releases of emotion, no  epiphanies.

I  turn to the journal prompts I found online. “Healing the Past,” reads  one. “Writing about loss or trauma.” OK, cool. I start writing, in  detail, every bad thing I remember ever happening to me. That isn’t  really the point of the prompt, but once I start, I find myself  completely unable to stop. I wonder if I’ve had a particularly traumatic  life. I decide that no, based purely on the worse experiences of people  I know, I have not. Still, my mind goes to some very dark places and  lingers, unsure whether to stay.

But then, the act of remembering, writing it all down by hand on a well-worn legal pad, starts to bear fruit. ...""

199,"TW : SH and abuse  


If you asked me 5 years ago, what my 5 year plan was : I'd tell you a heartbreaking truth, I hoped I'd be dead.  
I was sick of fighting to survive, I missed what it felt like to truly LIVE again, and it didn't feel like I stood much of a chance anymore. My arms were covered in scars, that were covered in tattoos with what some people might call ""cliche"", reminders to myself that ""this too shall pass"", and ""time heals everything"". I had been through so much in the last 15 years of my life that I just wanted to hit the refresh button, or opt out completely. I grew up in an unsteady home with a father who had psychosis but refused to take his medication, instead he turned to alcohol and various drugs. When I was 14 his faltering mental health got the best of him, we fought, I told him to go to hell... 3 hours later he took his own life.  
I blamed myself, I hated myself. Some of my own family blamed me. A few months later I was vulnerable and looking for comfort in all the wrong places, and was sexually assaulted at the hands of one of my family members and their boyfriend. I spiraled hard. I started cutting to the point I couldn't see smooth skin on my arms anymore.   
I tossed myself at much older men, typically men with mental health issues. Some part of my brain was trying to save people, because of what happened to my father, I felt like I owed the universe that much.  
Fast forward a few years, I had been in several abusive relationships, seen several counselors, therapists and specialists, my family all but discarded of me. I became a write-off until I got pregnant at 17. I had no clue what I was doing, my mother had helped me raise my son because I was overcome with postpartum depression on top of the depression and PTSD that was already there.  


Five years ago, I was pregnant again, expecting a baby girl with a man who had psychosis, refused to take his medication, and was addicted to meth. I was living a copy and paste lifestyle. Lather, rinse, repeat. Vicious cycle of self abuse.  
Social workers stepped in, and I lost custody of my son and my daughter, I fought for visitation, I fought to have them back in my home, I fought til my heart couldn't take it anymore.  
I was fighting a losing battle.   
coming up on 5 years ago ( January 29th,2015) I tried to take my life for the last time.  
One friend was all it took. One person to message ""code red"", which became my safety net. Code Red meant that I need to be babysat for a while, because I can't trust my own thoughts. It means I need a hug, I need to hear "" you matter. I care, please be nice to yourself, we love you."" Especially when I couldn't love myself.  
This friend sat me down and told me something he heard from a TV show called ""Glee"",  he said "" 2+2+2""   
In two weeks, will you feel what you feel now?  
In two months, will it matter to you?  
In two years, will you remember it?  
\- if not, breathe and let it go.  


There are still days that are dark and stormy, there are still times when I have to do yoga and breathing techniques and tell myself that I am a SURVIVOR and now, RIGHT NOW I get to LIVE, not just survive. I survived already, the worse parts are over, now I get to enjoy the sunshine, the warmth on my skin. I crawled out of my own personal hell, without thinking about the long term future. I lived 2 weeks at  time, until it became 2 months, then 2 years.  


Now, nearly 5 years later I have a new take on life. I'm expecting baby #3 and this time I'm fully ready and prepared, and next week I'm getting married to the absolute best human I've ever met.  
When people tell you ""it gets better"", they aren't lying.  
It's HARD, loving yourself when your mind tells you not to, that's probably one of the hardest things that anyone can do.  
But it's worth it, and it does get better.  
2+2+2. You're alive.

202,"In the last two years I've (25f) gone from a moderately confident (normal esteem levels, sometimes I felt bad but rarely) person to a self-loathing person. It seems to be getting worse. 

At this point, I loathe my own personality and habits. I hate the type of person I am and how I engage with the world. I feel like I am undeserving of respect and am awkward, rude, annoying, etc. Pretty much every negative thing you could be, I think I am.

I have this habit of noticing people who I think have perfect personalities or carry themselves very well and I will try to put their behaviors, habits, and mannerisms into practice to help myself be the version of myself that I want to be. To the point where I'm constantly self aware of how I am acting and as I am engaging, I am simultaneously self-criticizing. It is driving me insane. (Even in interactions with my husband, I'm constantly working to be loving, cute, entertaining, respectable). Even when I am trying to behave in ways that I admire, I end up hating how I am acting and the way it manifests in me.

I know rationally that  I should just be myself and try to be a kind, good, person. I know I am behaving in a ridiculous way that is so bad for my mental health. But, practically I just hate myself and my personality so much that it doesn't translate. I don't like people that act like me, when acting with my natural comfortable behavior, so why would I allow myself to be that way? I should probably just see a therapist but I honestly don't think it's going to help me, other than give me someone to vent to.

Anyway I was googling Psychologist that uses NLP in my city! eventually I found one he does psychotherapy and does NLP! I was so excited I finally found the one person in the city who does it! He has a bunch of degrees hes proper! so i Went to a session on Wednesday Felt fucking broken and depressed before after I felt like my mind was clear light no thoughts just totally relaxed and chilled and I felt positive I couldn't Fucking believe it!

I wanted to make this post for a couple reasons. First, if you're in a similar situation, I want you to know that you can (and should) get help, before it's too late. I know how scary it is to talk about it, but like many things, it really isn't as bad as you think it will be.

And second, I want to help clear the air a bit on this topic. I can't think of a single topic that is in a worse state of public discourse than pedophilia, and that makes the world a much more dangerous place. I hope that by talking about this, I can make the world safer.

I've struggled to function at full capacity for years and have finally been seeing a therapist for around two months now weekly to get the help I need. I don't get to see my therapist for two weeks currently due to some scheduling problems and I need somewhere to turn to today.

So now on to the problem: I'm having fight or flight responses just thinking about going to work tomorrow. I don't ever miss work but I've missed four days this month. Two due to a stomach virus, one due to a severe allergic reaction and then today, because I was up all last night having panic attacks frequently waking me from my sleep. A lot of my anxiety comes when I feel I'm not in control, and there's been so much happening this past week plus the allergic reaction which scared me quite a lot, I had a very very bad night and morning and so I took another day off because mentally I was not in shape for work. I haven't missed work since last winter by the way, so it's not often I miss, life is just hitting me hard and I still lack a lot of tools to help me cope, which is why I'm in therapy.

Anyways, ever since I missed those two days for the stomach flu, my managers have been cold to me. When I missed the day due to the severe allergic reaction, the following day they were kind of stand offish. They posted next weeks schedule today, and have cut my hours a lot for next week, I believe in retaliation for missing days, they've done it to other workers before. I'm dreading interacting with them tomorrow now.

I'm really struggling to relax. Sick to my stomach, mind going in a million directions, feeling like I'm teetering in the edge of some catastrophic collapse kind of struggling to be more specific.

Recently he's started collecting guns- which is fine I don't mind that but now he's started getting angry and ranting about killing people. Any time he gets angry it's I should kill them, I should shoot them- they should die.

He's actually a *councillor* which I learned quickly is very different than a therapist. As a councillor, he wasn't able to legally diagnose me with any mental illness. Some would find this upsetting but I actually took great comfort in it, knowing that I didn't have to worry about if there's something wrong with my brain, all I had to worry about was my current emotions. We talked mainly about the conflicts going on between my dad and my brother, as well as my mom, and we lightly touched on my history with drinking. I feel like he left me with some good messages. Obviously, I'm not better. I'm not gonna get better without time and effort, but we set up some weekly meetings for the next while, which I suppose was a good thing. So there you are, Reddit! I'm ready to get better and I'm ready to help others get set on the road to recovery. (Is recovery the right word?)",05Dec2019,1

Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, have the strength to face your crisis? When one life's faced with' crisis. and you see hate replace the holy faith of the righteous. We'll get you out of your crisis as long as you can meet the psychiatric ward's prices. We'll spend some time on greed and wealth, and then some on mental-health. Doin' the lotto tickets every Christmas. In five years, when this whole city's rich folks and hipsters, who're gonna miss this raggedy little business? Sometimes this world was so steadfast and stable, that man's word was held obligation, and now it is so false and deceivable, that word and work, as in conclusion. If your body comes from brutes, your soul uncertain or a fable, why not bask amid the senses while the sun of morning shines, for it is you, the finer brute rejoicing in your hounds, and in my stable, youth and health, and birth and wealth, and choice of women and of wines? The only way that I'm able to stay so stable, is if you're the legs to my table. When all, for yours, if you may call the offence, must feel war's blow, who does not spare innocence. And so, to travel hence, with feet of innocence. Their master's dead - and no one now Dwells in the Hall of Ivor &amp; Ezra. Horses, all are dead, they are the sole survivor. For the last known survivor, known as Onstad, stalks their prey in the night, when there is not a single soul to see the sight. It is certain, that they're watching all with the eye of the tiger. All of a sudden they are finding religion, all of a sudden, all of their sins are forgiven. To quote A Midsummer Night's Dream, ""Asleep, my love? What, dead, my dove?"" Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love: And you, three-time-crowned queen of night, survey. With your chaste eye, from thy pale skin above, thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway. But not to call me back or say goodbye, and further still at an unearthly height, O luminary clock against the sky. Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. O dear little cabin, I've loved you so long, and now I must bid you good-bye! I've filled you with laughter, I've thrilled you with song and sometimes I've wished I could have cried.

Warm regards,

* Your Beloved.",05Dec2019,1
