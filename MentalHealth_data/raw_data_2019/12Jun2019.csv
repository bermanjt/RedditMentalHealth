1,"Umm, I don't know how to start these things off, I have never been good at disclosing my feelings to anyone, I have been diagnosed with depression for nearly 4 months (that was the first time I went to see anybody about it), but I feel like it just keeps getting worse, recently I feel like I am alone and hated, even by people who are close to me, I always put on a fake smile because I don't want people around me to worry, I don't enjoy things I normally do, I barely sleep, I rarely eat, I just feel like I am a burden on everyone.",12Jun2019,1
2,"I am extremely anxious at night because of the roach infestation at my apartment. Those fuckers crawl on the walls and scare the hell out of me. I slept with the lights on and got about 4 hours of sleep because I awoke every 30 or so minutes to see if roaches were in my room. I was (and still am) sleep deprived and thought I saw bugs everywhere, even saw perceived the details of the wall as roaches moving. Now the only reason I was so paranoid was because the night before, for the first time I witnessed: An american roach trying to eat out of  my desk (it got away), another German roach on the wall that I did kill, and a roach drinking out of my bearded dragons water dish.   
Needless to say I was terrified. Last night however, I saw zero. I think this was the raid max roach barrier I put to nights ago finally working, or just coincidence. I would appreciate advice on sleeping through the night and not having a panic attack about the roaches that fester in my apartment and room, it would be greatly appreciated.",12Jun2019,0
3,"I have anxiety and have been going to the doctor's for help managing it. My doctor gave me some advice. 

They said to put in a journal or to tell myself this at least once every day:This is not my fault, this is how I was made, I cannot change this but I can manage it. I am not a burden by looking for help, nor am I being an attention seeker by reaching out. I am not just my mental health, I am more than that. I deserve help if I need it. 

I wanted to post it, in case this helped anyone else. I don't believe it yet myself, but I feel hopeful that one day I will believe this.",12Jun2019,1
4,"Me and my roommates relapsed on Meth yesterday. When we ran out my friend said there's a guy with weed who wants to hang out. Board and high I said yes even though I don't smoke it 
Turns out my friend got the guy on some hook up app and sent him my pic
When I got there and he got in the car and we parked I sat there stunned on what was going on. My friend then kept telling me what to do as in ware to touch and to go down on. I was in such a state of panic I disassociated and just performed to get it over. Most of the time was with her and her by getting high watching me go down on a stranger I wanted nothing to do with
After it was over it comes to me what happened. I freak out and my friend looks confused as to why I was mad
She tells me i wanted it and she was just giving ""options"" I was too high to refuse anything. She tells me ""arent you always complaing about being lonely""
I've spent the day freaking out what happened much of it at the mental health clinic. She's my roommate so I lost my apartment. I'm now homeless I tried calling her to see if she regrets it now that she's sober she tells me that I just didn't have the mental strength to handle the real world and need help

5,"  For years I have had this issue as well as being lazy. I'm 17 and I'm so behind in school that I might not graduate. I'm homeschooled and I have a deadline date to get everything done. I just can't stop. I get distracted by my phone or music or just start daydreaming. I've told my parents about this and asked about getting help, but they refuse to for some reason. I've tried removing distractions, setting a schedule, and waking up early, but I still can't manage to get my school work done. I also get very depressed and lonely at times because I don't really have a social life. I need to figure out how I can just stop this starting today or else I won't graduate. 

  I also have a hard time with studying to. For example, I read the material the best the I can and have even tried writing notes while I read, but I still can't remember anything on the tests. I still manage to get good grades because I go back through the book and find the answers, but I know that this isn't the way school is supposed to be like. And I'm probably not learning properly. The reason I'm concerned about this is because if I ever do graduate, I want to go to college, but I don't know how to study or do well in real school.

I just really need help. I want to graduate and I want to prepare myself for when I go to college ( if I ever do). I also just want to learn how to be a productive and normal human being because there are times when I can't even get myself out of bed in the morning and it just sucks.

6,"I think I'm slipping into depression. It's a familiar feeling. I feel like it's no big deal because I'm not suicidal. I just feel broken. It's not like I cry everyday. I don't know if it's worth going through the whole system of insurance and doctors and perscriptions because I'm sad sometimes. But when I'm overwhelmed I shut down. which is happening so much more frequently now. I've missed so much work over the past month. I've been skipping family events. I've pushed alot of my friends away. But I have a strong face most days during work, but not always. I feel like I'm having more bad days then good days. I swiped some of my relatives xanax and I've been taking those. I've been acting out sexually much more over the past year. But overall, i just feel like I'm drowning. And it takes so much energy to paddle. I'm always exhausted because my sleep schedule sucks and I eat like shit. I hate myself and my body. I hate the person I've let myself become. All I know how to do is fail and doubt myself. I have so many regrets. Idk who I am anymore. After a promised promotion fell through several times at work, I feel directionless therefore worthless. I want to apply for new jobs to get my head on straight but I'm frozen in place, terrified of every possibility. I expect so much from myself and I always let myself down. I'm down. Idk what to do. I just keep turning to temporary pleasures to try to fix it. Idk how to fix this. I hate the idea of going to therapy, I understand it's benefits but it's hard to comprehend why someone like me requires professional help. I'm sure there are plenty of other people with actual problems. And also my insurance is through my job and I want to leave my job, idk how any of it works.

9,"Hi! This is going to sound super weird, but I've had this fear of using bluetooth in any car for the past 2 years because each time I connected my phone previously I got into a wreck so my brain connected the two things for whatever reason. I know there is no logic behind this, but I still get really stressed out about connecting phone via bluetooth in cars now lmfao, I was wondering if anyone had any idea on how to get over this? I almost connected a couple of times recently but I got too anxious and didn't end up doing it. I know this is super fucking weird, but I want to get over this because it's getting annoying having people think I'm weird for refusing to use bluetooth lol. 

I know the only way is to actually do it but idk i just get too stressed does anyone have any advice? Or is there a specific name for this sort of thing so I could read up on it?

15,"Today I tried to confide in my mom about my mental health, but she refused to hear me out. She told me that she didn’t want to hear what I had to say because SHE didn’t want to get upset. I cried my eyes out begging her to listen to me until she got angry and eventually gave in. 

I will never try to confide in her ever again. 

I wasted my time trying to explain to her that I have PTSD, why my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD, and trying to talk about the sexual abuse I suffered. This wasn’t the first time either. Every time I have tried to talk to my mom about my mental health, she shuts me down and tells me to “get over it.” 

I understand that she’s not willing to listen because my therapist told me that it’s hard for parents to hear/see that their children are hurting. However, it makes me angry that I can talk more openly with complete strangers than I can with my own family. 

I literally told her that I just want her to listen to me instead of disregarding my feelings, but she told me, “What more do you want us to do? You want us to hug and kiss you? Tell you that you’re beautiful? You should be grateful that...”

17,"First, english is not my first language so i apolgyze if something sounds weird.
Im a 15 year old girl. Student. I live with my mom, dad, cat and a bird. We have some financial problems but that's not affecting us a lot. I have two close friends, two girls with the same age as me (that i met in the beggining of this year). Im also a artist, i love art, cinema, photography and pop culture. I live a rather normal life.
 3 weeks ago i went on my first convention, and i talked to a lot of people and got closer to those 2 friends of mine. Between those people, i talked to a girl that was cosplaying my favorite character from my favorite show. Actually, i just asked for a pic and she said something like ""oh, youre really cute"" and ""thanks sweetie"" when i complimented her. 
So i tweeted that picture with the caption ""i talked to this super nice girl, she is really talented and if anyone finds her @ pls tell me! She really deserves credit!!""
In the day after, she found my instagram and we talked a little about cosplay and music. 
then i followd her there and on twitter.
we exchanged tweets here and there. 
One day i was unfollowing some people and clicked on her profile, i saw all her cosplay pics and little videos. she seemed really happy, and i realized that i never felt that. im not saying that i have never felt happyness, that i feel empty. I love my family and drawing fills me with happyness. But
I never felt what is like being friends with someone else. Idk, i cant really get close to anyone. I can talk about my feelings, ideas and give my opnion to my friends or even people that i just met, i can give/recieve hugs and kisses but i dont feel a connection with them. Idk how to explain, when i see a group of friends i feel happy for them, bcuz they seem like they are having a good time, but inside i really want to feel that too.

24,"I’m 19F. When I was 15-17, I was extremely depressed. Self harmed and was suicidal. Got on anti depressants, have had the same therapist since then. I don’t know exactly when, but I overcame the depression. I was good for a really long time. Really happy... 

Suddenly I’m not anymore. I’ll have these days where I’m perfectly happy and everything is fine, and like a punch to the face, suddenly I’m just fucking sad. Just down and I start to feel really terrible. About myself, my actions, my body, my personality, just a bunch of self hatred shit. I don’t wanna think this way. I don’t wanna become this shit again. 

I manned up and I decided I’d let my boyfriend know. He was very sympathetic, he’s dealt with depression on his own too. It was a good heart to heart, I thought it would help me. But for some reason it feels like I’ve gotten worse. Today makes 2 days in a row I’ve just felt bad, even though nothing particularly bad has happened to spark it. 
This is the longest period of time I’ve felt this bad since I was 17. I’m so terrified.

I really really don’t wanna feel this way.  My boyfriend is the best thing I could ever ask for, and I don’t wanna push him away. My parents love me and each other unconditionally, but god I could not tell them about this. I can’t break their hearts all over again, especially considering I live away from home now. They’d be worried sick. I just can’t. My job is fantastic, I have great hours and good pay, and I generally enjoy the job. So why the fuck do I feel this way? Why so sudden, and why so fucking intense? I don’t want this. 

I don’t know if there’s anything to help, but any advice is appreciated. I don’t know what to do. Thank you.",12Jun2019,1
25,"The TLDR version: Florida has this thing called the Baker Act. It's a 72 hour hold for people who may be a harm to themselves or others due to mental health reasons. I was held for 5 days. I came to find out, no one gave a shit about me or anyone's mental health inside this impatient center. My stay was a glorified baby sitting service and the more I spoke to the other patients, the more I realized what a joke our mental health care system is. I suffered more by being Bakered than I would have if I had been left to my own devices. I ""relapsed"" hard in therapy, relapsed in my drug use, and it took over 3 months to see my therapist again, and many more months to get over what I endured.

&amp;#x200B;

This could get stupid long, so I'll stick to the highlights as much as possible.

\-----------

3 years ago (2016) I was Baker Acted by my mental health counselor on my 24th birthday. In short, I had left a questionable voicemail on her phone early morning (sometime between midnight and 3am) while standing on a bridge contemplating life and all that. I stayed there until the sun started to come up, and decided to go home, get high, and sleep off the suicidal ideation that had been haunting me for months.

Cops showed up my house really early and said they received a call that I was a danger to myself. I had 2 options, I could go willingly or they would drag me out the house. I chose ""willingly"". They placed me in handcuffs and they took me to a facility. 

\-----

Intake: They did this in the same giant room where they kept the patients. Everyone could hear everything that I was asked and despite my best efforts to keep my private medical history private, it was impossible in this echo-y room.

All my clothes were taken except for my shoes, but I had to remove the laces. On Day 2, they gave me back my socks, underwear, and bra to wear underneath my hospital gown. I wore these things for the remaining 3 days. I was given the option to have a tech wash my clothes every other day, but I felt extremely uncomfortable without my bra, so I let them have my underwear and socks to wash one other day.

They over prescribed me sleeping pills (150mg trazadone) and when I brought it up, they shut me down and threatened me with a longer stay. I cheeked my pills after the first night. They also prescribed me an antidepressant that I cant remember the name of but didnt want to take, but again, they threatened me with a longer stay. 

I saw the doctor twice during my 5 days. The first time was the morning of Day 2, I was so groggy from the sleeping pills when they woke me up sometime around 4am. The doctor asked me very personal questions with zero effort to show empathy. He was very cut and dry about it all.  ""How long have you been cutting yourself? and points to my legs showing old cuts poorly hidden by the sheet they gave me. I say ""not long"". Mind you, I'm maybe 5 feet away from the next person in bed separated by a curtain, there's no such thing as privacy unless everyone was as medicated as I was. He asks: ""why did you try to kill yourself?"" I say: I didn't. He says: ""your counselor said you tried to kill herself. How long have you been depressed?"" I say: on and off for years. He says: ""are you currently suicidal, do you plan on harming yourself?"" I say no. He turns around and walks away, the tech says something like ""you can go back to sleep now.""  I stayed up enough to hear him talk to the person next to me, but then went back to sleep, I was so ""tired.""

The food we were given was identical to the stuff you get in public school. I couldn't even stand the smell, it made me nauseous. I spent 5 days swapping my whole tray for someone's juice or apple sauce. I had major diarrhea for 5 days. I lost almost 10 lbs by the time I got home. I asked everyday for pepto or something for my stomach. On day 5, I was given tums a few hours before I was released.

I spoke to a very pregnant woman on Day 2, maybe she was a counselor, I have no idea. She asked more in depth questions, but made very little attempt to counsel or discuss any of my answers. She just took notes in her computer the entire time. 

Questions like:  Do you know why your here? Why'd you try to kill yourself? Do you live with anyone? Do you work? Are you in school? Are you in a relationship? Is it abusive? Have you ever experienced abuse or sexual assault ever? How was your upbringing? How is your relationship with your parents? Do you see a doctor now? Are you on meds? What previous meds have you been on?  What are your plans when you leave here? \*\*\*Do you feel that the medication we have given you has helped?\*\*\*

I answered everything very honestly, I elaborated, because I really did want help and I thought this woman was there to provide me counseling, but it was just for notes for my file. For what?

The medication question triggered me and I blew up at her. I just answered all these questions about real personal shit and then this dumb fucking question is asked. I said I was given medication without a proper evaluation and that my trazadone was unnecessary and way too high a dosage. I also mentioned that it was stupid to ask me if I felt a difference since taking the antidepressant one time that morning because it takes weeks to notice a difference in the body. 

She said something like ""well the doctor spoke to you this morning and agreed that the antidepressant and trazadone were necessary."" 

and I said ""the doctor making a stop at my bedside while I was half conscious at 4 am for 30 seconds isnt a proper evaluation."" 

She didn't really comment. I ranted on about the diarrhea from the food and haven't been given pepto or anything to help. I brought up that we didn't do group therapy yesterday after lunch. She said she would make a note about the pepto and that we would be having group therapy today. She asked me if I had trouble sleeping because I stayed in bed all day yesterday and most of the morning today. I told her that there was nothing to do, so why not stay in bed? She said that if I wanted to be released, that I couldn't be in bed all day crying, otherwise the doctor will think I still need to be here. She said, ""if you need to cry, go to the bathroom, dont let 'them' see you cry, you'll be released sooner"" 

 I asked ""how does the doctor know anything about my mental well being if he spoke to me for all of 30 seconds."" She said that we are being monitored at all times and notes are made in our files of what we do.

So I said ""you hire nurses to watch us, but not help us?"" and she said ""they are not nurses."" Around this point I got up and slammed to door on my way out of her office. Then I was paranoid that any second I was going to be sedated like another girl from earlier that morning who had a fit.

In the 5 days I was there, we had group therapy once. We talked about hygiene. It was a lecture, not a discussion because some of the people that were there before me refused to shower (they didnt smell or anything, nobody would have noticed TBH).

On day 4 we had 30 minutes of patio time. We basically sat on this tiny porch at a wooden table for 30 minutes and then went inside.

During the 5 days, I got in an argument with a tech over pepto, and then asked to be released since it was passed the 72 hour hold. She said ""you cant leave until the doctor says so"" and i replied ""you guys arent helping me, you dont do anything here, this is so fucking stupid"" and as I was walking away she said ""well you shouldn't have tried to kill yourself then."" Of course all the other patients in the room heard her say this.

At one point my father visited me and I specifically asked for them NOT TO SHARE MY INFO WITH HIM, WHY I WAS THERE.... and the first thing he asks is ""why is she in here"" and the tech I JUST SPOKE TO said ""oh she tried to kill herself"" as if she was telling someone the fucking weather. 

The entire 5 days I was bored out of my fucking mind. The puzzle had a shit ton of missing pieces that one of the other patients kept stealing and flushing (I really wanted to fight this kid, ruining the one distraction I had). The books were unreadable, so many pages were ripped out. The TV had the same 10 channels, mostly news or talk shows, I had nonstop diarrhea, and no one was taking our mental health seriously.

On day 5, like 4am, the doctor comes around and wakes me up (the 2nd time I saw him the entire time), he says ""how are you feeling today?"" Half asleep, I replied something like ""fucking fantastic"". He says great and moves on. That's it.

On day 5, around 3pm, I'm told I get to leave. With my discharge papers they had given me a script for the antidepressant. I said I likely couldn't afford it, if I could get prescribed something cheaper, they said that I would have to see another doctor for that. They didn't even attempt to give me a referral. 

I made a call to be picked up once I was escorted out of the facility. The following day I made an attempt to fill my script. It was over $200 for a 1 month supply. I had a total shitshow meltdown in publix and told the pharm tech I wouldnt be filling my script. I cried all the way home, like a wave of anger and frustration hit me from being treated like nothing at the facility and then having the final punch being unable to afford the medication. I emailed my counselor and blamed her, told her snippets of my stay at the facility, and told her I never wanted to see her again.

I went back to therapy 3ish months later after a drug binge.",12Jun2019,12
26,"I have been diagnosed with SA and depression, that's not what I think I'm making up though. For the past few months I've been keeping a journal because I was concerned about my mental health, something felt wrong but I couldn't figure out what exactly.

In my journal I never referenced any problem more than once.

I was better off up there, I was more myself, happier then down here, I could relax, I could go out in peace, it was better. 

But back home, I feel like I'm being forced to enjoy it. Visit family I hate. Trying to start an argument with my father and mother. Try and be calm and nice to my rude sister and anger issue brother.
But I just can't help but just feel like shit. 

As it says in the title my birthday is coming this Thursday. Usually I would just celebrate by going drinking or chilling with my childhood friend, my ROTC friend, and the extremely small amount of friends I had. 
And yet I just feel like I'm a bother, an annoyance to them. That deep down they hate me. I try to be a great friend. Texting them, making sure they're good, and just being there for them. 

But, it's always me that texts first, that has to be the one to start a conversation. I can count the amount of times a friend has texted me first. 

And it's only twice. 

I just feel unworthy of being their friend. I want to stop. 

I wanted to have some for of a bright side by inviting one over to hangout with, but he would never respond. I get this busy but this has happened over and over again. 

And my family, especially my father, won't stop pestering me to celebrate my birthday. No matter how many times I tell them I don't want to do anything, I don't want to celebrate. They just see it as me being ungrateful to them.


I just want to sleep and never wake up sometimes. Or just pretend it's not my birthday in two days. 

I hate it. I just hate it. It has never felt good in years.",12Jun2019,1
30,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the appropriate place to post this, I have been struggling with this for a long time and I need some answers. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in middle school (2010-ish), I was extremely depressed and was struggling with anorexia and suicidal thoughts. One night I saw an episode of a TV show and created my own character to fit into the show (The Walking Dead). It started out as an innocent daydreaming thing, but it quickly turned into an entire world in my head and the character I created had her own backstory, personality, and life. 9 years later I am still going into my mind and living through her. She's had birthdays, she experienced losses, depression, and has flaws like any other living breathing human. It has gotten to the point where I'm in this alternate reality (?) 90% of the time and when I'm driving, I don't remember driving at all until I reach my destination. I'm more excited about being in my mind than actually being present in real life. I'm starting to confuse and blur the lines between my character's world and mine, and I am very dependent on this character now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My doctors looked at me like I was crazy, one even said I was too old for ""imaginary friends,"" except this character and I have NEVER interacted with one another. I'm her, in a sense, but she also acts independently. She has always stayed in my mind and has never manifested herself in real life. 

Multiple personality disorder was also brought up, and the amnesia-like symptoms matches up and I have experienced some of the risk factors including PTSD, depression, and childhood sexual abuse. However, this character has never been an alternate personality and I've never spoken or acted as her, if that makes sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea of any of this made sense, but I really need some answers because I can't drive anymore due to being in my own world instead of reality. Is it just an overactive imagination? My brain's way of coping with trauma? ADHD? Pure craziness? Any input and/or a direction to resources is greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and OCD. I did experience childhood and adulthood sexual, physical, and mental abuse. I do take medication and other than this problem, I'm feeling much better than years ago.",12Jun2019,1
31,"So when I was around 16-17 I used to have a very high sex drive but soon after I was put on antidepressants, now I’m 21 years old and my sex drive is practically non existent. I still think women are attractive and would like to be in a relationship with one. I was just wondering if it’s at all possible to become Asexual after having a high sex drive in my teens",12Jun2019,1
32,"I have anxiety and depression and every so often, I have a freakout, which can lead to a panic attack. During these, I'll often hyperventilate (breath very quickly in and out) and my parents get angry when I do this. They say stuff like, ""You better stop doing that or I'm taking your phone/electronics away."" These statements make me even more stressed and hyperventilate even more. My parents are good people and they try to help, but I'm not sure how to help them understand. I tell them I can't stop with tears coming down my eyes and they just say like,"" Yes, you can! Don't talk like that."" This also stresses me out. What am I supposed to do in these situations?",12Jun2019,2
33,"I’m not entirely sure if this would be the best place for me to do this, or how reddit works yet but bare with me. I tend to ramble a lot and this could be a lengthy text. I’ve felt this sudden urge to wanna get some stuff off my chest.

I’m a 17/F from Canada, and over the years I’ve dealt with what I’ve been told by friends that seems to be anxiety issues. You might be thinking “What if they’re wrong, or simply not reliable enough to diagnose whatever it is that I feel.” I’ve been told that i’m one to seem like i don’t give a crap, but underneath the mask is someone overly sensitive. After posting this I’m hoping to find some more advice from others. I’m honestly not entirely sure where I wanna start, but here goes nothing. 

I’ve dealt with a various amount of feelings that make me question my mental health. They leave me wondering if what I feel is really as it seems? I’ve spend a number of nights over the years questioning if what I feel is anxiety, or if what I went through was depression. You spend so much time keeping to yourself, overthinking, bottling up all the stress and thoughts in you till you completely break down. At 15 I remember spending my days at home in my room isolating myself from my supposed ‘friends’ and away from my family. Blasting music loud enough so that you wouldn’t hear me crying over this and that. Just thinking of it jokes me up because reading it out loud seems unreal. To have slept half my days away, and spend my days in bed. 

As time went by I’ve grown, but still in confusion of what exactly it is I’m going through. I’ve tried talking to my parents when I feel the way I do, and if anything is asked along the lines of feeling sad or generally mental health, they immediately ask if I pray, or even just say it’s all in my head and that I could be over exaggerating. Almost as if nothing is really wrong with me, and I think that’s probably one of the reasons I’m confused or lost about it. 

Not that long ago I was kinda in a dark place, if not a few times. I noticed myself feeling really down and not wanting to go to school. My brother noticed I spent my days off sleeping a lot more than I should have been. After he pointed that out, one night I had decided that I advocate for myself and seek help. I noticed that going to friends was getting hard because I was struggling and there was only so much they could do on their end. I planned to go to my school office and tell them I need to talk to someone to discuss possible anxiety issues. The next day I felt myself wanting to chicken out about the whole idea, and forget about it. Seeking help has always been something I wanted to do but could never seem to fall through with. It took some time but after 30 minutes of feeling uneasy, I grew the courage to do what I had planned. It took some days to get things going being that I continued missing days and the days I went to school the child and youth worker was away or busy. After some time the cyw (child and youth worker) finally met up with me and told me what the next steps were. I had signed a consent form, and since then my attendance continued to be terrible, and days I were at school I sat in classes hoping the cyw would call me to his office. With the school year ending I feel like i’ve gotten no where. Like i’m stuck and back to feeling alone and bottling up my emotions. 

This year I’ve been struggling academically and It’s been really taking a toll on me. It’s the last week of school before exams, and I have a pile of outstanding assignments and failing marks in my classes. It’s my Junior year and I’ve done terrible. My mom has been really hard on me about it, and we’re constantly arguing about this or that. She tells me I spend too much time on my phone, and that i’m lazy. When what I feel is unmotivated and hard to focus with school. I could tell you I’m on my phone to distract me, and it does. But it’s also I get a hold of my real friends. My online friends. The people that know the real me, and people I can trust. Sure that might not be reason enough to some, but it is for me. She’s never been supportive, or encouraging when it comes to school. I feel like I only ever disappoint her and that i’m not enough. 

I’m starting to feel that everything I’ve written is all over and has no main purpose to it. I feel it doesn’t make very much sense what so ever.  I think I felt the urge to get stuff off my chest because I need to figure out the whole seeking help situation. Do I go to the school and see if I could talk to the cyw? Do I book an appointment at the clinic or something?? What would I talk about to the cyw if he’s able to finally meet?? What does this all this sound like? What will all this sound like to others?? An endless amount of questions are running through my head and I’m beginning to feel alone. I hate this. 

If you gotten this far, or even bothered to read it. Give me your input. I’d appreciate it a whole lot.",12Jun2019,2
34,"Resilient

A person able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions.

Throughout our lives, we are all exposed to trials and unexpected events that will ultimately impact us. These adversities can be anything from daily struggles such as an alarm not going off or an argument with a friend. To life-altering events such as a divorce or death of a loved one. Big or small, quick or long lasting, every experience will have an effect on us. The question is, how will these experiences affect us. Will we learn from them? Will we overcome them? Will we succumb to them? Even if we don’t know it, how we handle these situations and what we gain or lose form them is slowly changing us and developing our patterns of behavior. Like falling dominoes, these patterns will begin to impact every aspect of our lives, from our success to our relationships to our sense of self.

Resiliency

Example: Two individuals living in similar demographics, exposed to slimilar traumas. Assumptions would be that given the similarity in their lives they would likely also share similarities as adults. Some might predict patterns of unhealthy behavior often associated with trauma. However, what if instead we found that only one of the individuals followed unhealthy patterns such as substance use, toxic relationships, and violence? What could account for this difference in outcome?

Benefits:

Reduces mental health issues (depression, Anxiety, PTSD)

Increases self-esteem

Reduces unhealthy behaviors (substance use, toxic relationships, violence)

Reduces chances for retraumatization

Improves the quality of life

Contributions to Resiliency

Motivation: Deciding to Be Different

Example: For one individual we may see a pattern of continued substance use leading to additional trauma experiences. After years of this cycle, this individual has likely learned helplessness in their situation and no longer sees a way or reason for the change. The other individual has likely avoided this pattern through therapeutic or personal means, thus avoiding unhealthy behaviors and therefore reducing the likelihood of additional trauma. This individual in return has learned the power of their decisions and has increased the sense of control they have in their life. The first difference in the resiliency level of these individuals has come down to their decisions. In other words, what we can gather from this is that our decisions matter.

It is important to have goals and dreams. These help us feel that there is a reason for us to strive to be the best versions of ourselves that we can be.

Cognition: All About Perception

Example: We may find that only one of these individuals viewed themselves as able to overcome the adversity faced. This would contribute to their having the coping skills to deal with the failure and the pain experienced as well as allow them to continue to see the world, and themselves, in a positive way. The other likely suffered from low self-efficiency believing that they were too weak, or the situation was too big to overcome. Continuing this pattern in life this individual may have never felt capable of achieving better things feeling that the experiences in their past put them too far down to be able to rise from.

How we see the events in our lives can determine whether we respond to them. Our perspective will impact the way we approach all situations. If we think the world is just out to get us why would we try to make it different? But if we see adversity learning opportunity we can make it just a new challenge to defeat.

Emotion: Benefits of a Good Attitude

Example: We may conclude that only one of them possessed positive affect allowing them to see the positive in the adversity. This individual may be more likely to form positive relationships and reduce the effects of mental disorders through positive self-esteem. This does not mean that mental health disorders, such as PTSD, were not present, only that they was able to overcome them due to strong emotional coping skills. The other person we may find struggles with negative affect even into adulthood. They may be more likely to have less healthy attachments and a more negative reflection of the world and thier past.

Having a positive attitude can help us overcome many obstacles. Not only do positive emotions actually keep our bodies healthier it can help build relationships and increases self-esteem. All of which can help up overcome adversity.

Conclusion

Although both individuals have many shared experiences and have shared similar trauma, both individuals went on to lead very different lives. For one, poor motivation and a lack of cognitive and emotional coping skills led them down a path that not only increased their trauma exposure but prevented them from living a high quality of life. The other managed to motivate themselves out of the situation and grow beyond it with the use of positive cognitive perception and emotional effect. Although some natural poses personality traits and disposition in order to accomplish this, this does not mean that the skills are not achievable through therapeutic means. Counselors trained in trauma recovery may help clients form these skills leading to a better life and the overcoming of a tragic past. These counselors can help clients form goals, identify motivators and increase cognitive and emotional coping skills. In the end, clients are able to improve the capability for resiliency not only over past events but for anything life throws their way.

36,"I missed my last appointment two months ago. I don't have refills for my lexapro until I go back to the therapist, but I have no desire to take it again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was on a migraine medicine from fourth to eighth grade. Starting in fifth grade, I developed an anxiety disorder that escalated to extreme social anxiety in eighth grade. I dropped those meds and was feeling reasonably better.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew I needed to see a therapist in ninth grade, so I went and immediately, I had pills shoved in my face. That was the one thing I didn't want to happen. I expected to be taught coping mechanisms and asked questions, and have someone actually listen- not make me fill out a sheet and send me on my way.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have a feeling your therapist shouldn't make you feel like your problems don't matter. She left my file open on the computer with one sentence: ""The patient does not seem to be having real panic attacks.""

&amp;#x200B;

She proceeded to return to the room, talk over me, ignore me, and tell me to leave and come back in a couple months.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't go to public school anymore because I'd end up stuck in the bathroom almost daily having panic attacks. My doctor actually made me feel suicidal. I will not return, though I have a feeling I might be dragged to the office because my mother is convinced I need medication instead of actual therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no other options besides the therapist I'm already seeing. I want to quit the pills, never see that woman again, and find a natural approach to coping with my condition. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I should try socializing, but how? Where? I would literally just hang out at the local diner every morning if I had the money. I tried getting a job, but had a panic attack and got fired. (I loved my job and I really miss it, but I'm scared to try again.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have two friends. One is an extremely bad influence and the other lives a little too far for me to see often. Plus, I'm the type who can't sit around and do nothing. I need stimulation and to feel like every action achieves something.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people apparently just don't like me, so I can't make new friends very easily. I'm extremely kind apart from being slightly strange.

&amp;#x200B;

Yoga makes me feel better. So does writing, meditation, and every other thing I want to do that my family thinks is stupid and pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to think I'm never gonna feel better and I'll never be able to cope. I overheard my mom telling my aunt the doctor might tell me to apply for disability if she hears I can't work because of my problem. It feels like because I don't go to public school, every one thinks my efforts are nonexistent and nothing I do counts. I cried all night when I got fired. It was like the world had confirmed that I'm useless, and I really don't know how to take it.

&amp;#x200B;

I refused to tell the hiring manager I had an anxiety disorder because I wanted to be strong enough that it didn't matter. I loved working so much. It hurt, but I loved it. I recently got a very low-paying freelance job in online transcription, but haven't worked all week because I was told the internet would get turned off any second and I can't start a job without absolute assurance I'll be able to finish in time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every morning, I wake up ready to go and then life shits on my efforts. Mom always says we'll go to the bank and set up my account, then never takes me. I try to work, but something makes it impossible. Same with studying. I want to eat healthy, but literally have no choice about what I eat unless I want to steal. Which isn't an option. My family would laugh at me if I tried to eat better anyway.

It feels like I'm not allowed to succeed.

Im a 20 yr old male. I hate myself so goddamn much. I feel hopeless, worthless. I was a ""gifted kid"" in elementary school. Straight A's without paying attention, I had friends, had a good relationship with my family. Then we moved out, and my teen years were garbage. People tought me to hate myself. I had very little friends, and the rest of the world seemed to find me disgusting. I was ugly, dumb, worthless, and at best people would simply ignore me. People would hang out make friends get laid etc while I'd stay in my room playing video games and masturbating.
Last year I dropped out of school, too scared to face the crowd and too tired to study and stuff. I got my own place in the city and thought I'd do music, the only thing that kept me company through it all. I've been playing guitar and various other instruments since I was life beforeBut even that I can't do, even with all the effort I put in I can't seem to write a single song, while my depressed heroes wrote my anthems at 18 with minimal equipment and more intense mental health problems. I work a garbage minimum wage job to pay for drugs and material stuff. I've made friends, I've had relationships and people tell me I'm good and pretty and worth something, but the mantra I chant in my head is always ""I'm the worst piece of shit ever, I should have accomplished more by this age and I'm wasting everyone's time, space and oxygen by being alive, yet I'm too much of a pussy to actually be depressed and anxious enough to end it all."" I've never attempted suicide but I always think of it, always wish I had the guts to just end it all and let go. I now fill my arms with cigarette burns (too much of a pussy to cut myself apparently), I'm convinced I have no future. I'm emotionally dependent and I've recently entered a relationship with someone I think I actually love for real, not just because they like me, but I know I'm gonna fuck it up like I've fucked everything up in my life before.
I'm not special, I don't have the worst upbringing ever. But I'm tired of waking up every day and tired of pretending everything will be better cause I still hate every day. I still feel like the worst piece of shit to ever live. 
Sorry for wasting your time with my uninteresting and not so bad situation. Maybe I just needed like minded people to hear my story, cause I don't even feel like my friends are my friends.

I have generalized anxiety, and one of my worst triggers is health. I'm terrified of getting sick, passing out, panic attacks, and especially of things like heart attacks. If I feel even a little unwell I start to get anxious.

I get uncomfortable and anxious when I can feel or hear my heartbeat. It makes me focus on it, and if it feels faster than normal or like its pounding, I start to get anxious, worrying that it's leading to a panic attack or something else awful. And naturally, the anxiety makes it worse.  The worse my anxiety gets, the closer I get to a full blown panic attack.

51,"Hello, I’m currently 20 years old and I’ll be turning 21 soon. I’m in college and I’ll be getting my AA spring 2020, and from there I will be transferring to a school not to far from me.
I want to leave my house, this was my only escape, but my parents would me to stay until I start studying for my masters.

To anyone else this would be okay. But just the thought made me cry like a child.

My father used to be fun until he came back from the army in 2007. He made us stop celebrating all holidays and he became very abusive and mentally abusive to me, my two brothers and my mom. My sister was spoiled. 
     
Years go by, summer before becoming a 7th grader I was sent to a Salvation Army Christian camp. While there I won a contest, the prize was a large peanut m&amp;m bag. I shared with some kids but not many since I was bullied quite harshly there. When I got home I was happy to see my parents but my father would constantly comment on my weight. I was 11. My family would laugh it off but I grew uncomfortable. As soon as the next day came he made me stand on a broken scale that read 110 pounds. He screamed at me and shouted and called me a fat*ss and told me I would be a fat whore. He then told me to run for 30 minutes straight in the backyard. Once my mom left he would take me in, beat me then make me go back out. If I couldn’t sprint for 30 minutes straight he would repeat the process.
     
I became depressed and I would self harm heavily. My self esteem was gone and I would find myself randomly crying. I would cry when someone didn’t want to be my friend, I even tried to hang out with people who did not like me. When I got home my dad would make me run and beat me anytime I couldn’t do something he wanted. So I gave up on straight As and he beat me for that too. 
    
One day I decided to tell him that I was hurting myself and he screamed and beat me for doing that. The next day they asked why and I told my parents that I was unhappy and I wanted to die. They said I was just crying for attention and the next time I cut myself I better die. I will never forget that conversation...
      
He would take my little cousins and laugh and say “we aren’t going to grow up like **** right? We aren’t going to grow up to be a dumb *ss like ****!” And I would sit there and grow hate for the kids he compared me to.
     
He would take the food I was eating and replace it with plain Greek yogurt. I was banned from using certain toppings and eating certain foods. I remember at a party he yelled at me in front of everyone for putting mayo on my burger. 
      
He would make me pick up rocks while wearing 60 pounds of weights on my back while carrying a heavy bottle of water. One day he made me do this and told me he would fetch me in an hour, 5 hours pass and it was dark and I began to cry. Neighbors tried to intervene but I begged them not to say anything. And when I came inside no one batted an eye at me. 
      
One time he wanted to be sprint at the gym, we have access to a private one. Since I couldn’t he beat me with a weighted jump rope in front of his coworker who just chuckled at me. 
       
After he stopped beating me for working out, after I graduated early, he refused to let me go to college because I haven’t earned it. He would then make me (thank his uncle for this lovely idea!) remember 40 words and their definition and how to spell them in one day. Each word I couldn’t remember is 1 blow I would suffer. One day he assigned 80 words and I couldn’t remember any of them, so on Halloween night is when he made me kneel over the couch before beating me while my mom sat in the garage. Apparently she had no idea what was going on. And in the end she blamed it on me anyways.

He also would drop me off in random areas 10-30 miles from home and make me walk home with no phone and with bad shoes and no water. 

He would randomly wake me up and kick me out in the middle of the night.
When I was younger he would beat me while I was asleep which made me have a fear of sleeping on my back.

Now that I’m older he says that he never beat me, that I was spoiled. My mom agrees.
Now that I want to move out they are saying that they don’t know what the rush is. They don’t understand why I want to leave.

Am I wrong for wanting to leave and possibly cut them out of day about 90%? My father never apologized... and claims it never happened.. should I remind him when I’m about to leave?",12Jun2019,4

Can't sleep

I hate that I feel like I have to ask strangers on here instead of Facebook and Instagram... and person 

Long story short, my grandma is back in the hospital for the 5th or 6th time in the last 6 months. She has heart failure and kidney failure... again. Before, it was a whole bunch of other things.

It's not simply ""losing a grandparent.""

I already lost my language and culture on both sides of my family because of colonization from Residential School on one side of the family and the Vietnam War on the other.

I hate when people judge and ask why I don't speak my languages. 

I grew up living with a pedophile on each side of my family up until I moved out at the age of 18, so because of the ripple effects of intergenerational  trauma, as well as that, I wanted nothing to do with the languages and cultures on both sides of my family.

I tried to go to Vietnam to get to know my extended family, language, and culture, to try give back to my community by teaching English. I was shunned by family, locked in the house during the day, locked away from washroom access so I pissed in a bag in my bedroom. 

I fucked off and got a hotel room where I was locked in my hotel room and raped by hotel workers. I dealt with their corrupt police who wanted a bribe. I didn't. The police laughed in my face. Bribing would have come up in court. Not bribing prolonged my pointless fight and poor justice system where I found out vketnam doesn't have rape kits, the people lack empathy and don't  even know what counsellors and mental health are, and the testing was done in a dusty open garbage where the door was a clear rubber duck shower curtain for children.

When I told what happened and showed the bruises to my family, my husband's family, friends, and work (only the gyst when I've had mental break downs because of xyz and they asked), I've been told:

\- ""What the hell do you except us to do from here?!"" 

\- ""Get over it"" 

\- ""You're uninvited to our wedding"" 

\- I've been fucking shunned 

\- and fired.

I have been in 5 car accidents, dealt with bully bosses and corrupt perverted managers, and am married to somebody who also comes from a family where one side dealt with residential school, and the other, poverty and the many issues that go along with that.

I know that nobody is perfect and that ""all"" families are dysfunctional in their own ways, but when I went to couple's counseling, one of the phrases keeps ringing in my mind. ""You two were born to fail."" Meaning, with such shit upbringings, being surrounded by racism (complete strangers, family, lifelong friends, and so on, including non-\_\_\_ and people dealing with internal racism, have been racist around me and be like, ""Natives this, Asians that.... except you guys. You guys are different.""),  and with one traumatic event after the other, how the fuck were we supposed to make it big or far?!

In my early 20s, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As I get older, my sleep and back issues (etc.) are finally taken more seriously \*THIS YEAR\*. I am constantly seeking professional help...

I'm now back at my parents' place struggling to balance who to put first. Supposedly I should put myself, husband, then grandma first... I struggle because of the debt Vietnam spiraled into all these years with all the doctors, counsellors, psychiatrists, medications, acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine, massages chiropractors, etc. Healing being a lifelong journey feels like a neverending lonely eternity. 

I have chosen my grandma above my husband and I and it has clearly taken a toll. I need to get the fuck out of this house that has fucked me up beyond repair, but I am constantly struggling to simply live in the moment. Every time I feel like I have positive things lined up and things prioritized, shit hits the fan. You get kicked down and try to get back up, but you keep getting kicked and fucking beaten down again and again. It has always been an issue. 

So, I choose my grandma. She's basically the only close relative on that side where I can try squeeze stories and information on who our other relatives may be on my native side. I basically disowned the other side of my family (Vietnamese), but am slowly warming up to some of them and slowly remembering happy times in Vietnam...

It's a fucking pain to have family help, yet also trigger and push those buttons again. We've been there for a little while and a relative was judging, asking how much and why we have a certain amount saved up. I explained how part of the issue is having to drop things to take care of my grandma. It fucking twists me up inside to be told that it's my choice and fault I can't afford to move out and that it should be my mom's responsibility.  I've been my grandma's main caregiver and then my mom has been the next. The rest of the fucking family lives in town, but for xyz, they rarely visit or help. My Asian grandparents are gone now as well as my foster grandparents who helped take care of my parent as a teenage Vietnam war refugee.

Side note, the phrase ""normal, but not okay: has come up. One example is that it has become normal to watch family slam a mickey of vodka first thing in the morning, but not okay. It's normal for my family to have quiet awkward dinners (big family gatherings) where everyone sits quietly and doesn't talk because of all of the grudges, or snapping ""out of nowhere"" instead of working shit out. There are so many of these in both mine and my husband's that we need to break, but how? It is so confusing and confusing to break away from the people you are supposed to be able to turn to, look up to, and love.

I am jumping up and down on my page plus I've been writing this since 2 or 3 am. It is now 4:07.  So pardon if I'm not making much sense right now... but I need this shit out.

Just to say it, my art, modeling, photography, and so on is an expression of the shit life, breaking social norms, and female empowerment. I was raised where sex was bad, I was told I was fat, lazy, stubborn etc. as a child. I always got good grades, yet was ridiculed for getting a B+ in math because they got an A in math.... They never showed up at recitals, left in the middle of my graduation... the only time I ever remember being called a good girl was when I got my learner's.... it was normal to get hit, spanked, yelled at, change clothes and not know which relative was watching me, etc... I was exposed to sex at the age of 7. I was exposed to cheating and drugs around the same time, too. I was left home alone with my infant sister starting at the age of 4.5-5 at night, thus starting my insomnia... waiting for safety... Cleaning and arranging my room all night and morning, sleeping from about 7 am-830 am before running to school at the age of 10. Hard to explain to family who judge and don't care to ask directly but asks others about my modelling or when I was camming. Other relatives who clearly have some sort of mental health issues who laughs at others"" mental health, as if it's not real. IT'S 2019!!!!!!!!!

Hopefully last rant. I took care of a sick family member who tried sexually molesting me in my sleep. He and his wife treated me like shit before and after I helped when he was fucking dying in his hospital bed. They are a person of power and a relative. I fucking hate that when I explained to work why this was even harder to handle because of being retraumatized, etc. and they have always claimed that they understand mental health, but they ""let me go"" out of nowhere ""due to lack of work."" I can go off about the brutal corruption in that one workplace forever, too. Holy shit. Anyways. It fucking hurts when those you love loves those who hurt you.

Again, these are all in brief and each individual segment should be its own novel. 

The hard thing is, as a victim, I am still trying to be vague and protect the perpetrators. I forgive some, and if it were only so simple to say who each asshole was so you can really grasp how fucked all of this is.

I can truly verify that family, friends, coworkers, strangers, and people of power are corrupt and getting away with it. 

I try look at their past, but there's only so much that can be forgiven, and I dont understand where these perpetrators are so selfish or somehow believe that their actions are justified just because it happened to them, they are so hurt that they dont care who else they hurt through their actions whether direct or indirect (sexual assault, rape, pedophilia, drug and addictions, etc.)

It's now 444

The whole point was to vent because I cant sleep

I am scared I'll lose my grandma

I am lost trying to do all this self care shit and balance that with work and husband

I just want to be happy

That's all I ever wanted 

And why is it that those around me are okay?

I get so confused when supports around me and lifelong friends have blurted that they love white privilege and that they think that gender inequality isn't real (regarding rape and sexual assaults, the workplace, etc).

I'm stuck back in my hometown where I feel like I'm surrounded by small town closedminded people 

Like, yeah, again, trh live in the moment and live day by day, but I cant even sit for a half hour without depression or anxiety taking over.

Ugh, again. Whole point.

I was told ots my fault I chose grandma over making money and if I'm too busy working to push it back to my mom where I know she wont push it onto other people to help. ""Its then her fault if grandma gets sick and dies, not your problem""

It crushes me

It goes against everhtbjng I've lived for

Tl help others

Prevent shit

I took care of my little siblings growing up,  got into teaching, homecare, and all kinds of jobs where I've always been the person behind the scenes somehow helping out... but how can I give when I am so lost? 

I brought up how I cant feel comfortable sharing this on Facebook, Instagram, and in person at times (I do rant, but delete and regret.) but my family tends to keep shit in, keep it private,  and pretend shit is okay and think that when I share this, I am sharing their story, but it's my fucking story too. These are people who were supposed to be there for me, these were supposed to be my role models, theh were supposed to protect me. They were supposed to love me I'm healthy ways instead of fucking bein jail and on drugs, cheating, getting in car accidents, beating me, etc. So it's not jsut their fuckkng story.

I came out as suicidal last year (more than usual. But it's my first time admitting online to EVERYONE). I told my best friend all this. Known him for 25 years.  He had NO CLUE. That's how bottled up things were. It literally feels like blackness I've been holding onto for years and just explodes - even though I've seen professional after professional,  it simply isnt the same as having human connection and interaction.

Another insult is being told that ""taking care of grandma isn't a real job."" I used to take care of seniors for a fucking living. How dare they. About their own family. Spoiled little ungrateful selfish shit.

How is anybody supposed to heal if people don't know?! Spread the fucking word. You're not alone. 

Anyways, fuck. 5 am.

70,"Just a bit of context, I love my mum 
because she is my mum but at the same time I can't be with her and I think all chance of a relationship is out of the question.  I also live in the UK with my grandmother. Parents are not together.

So my mum has an illness and I get that life for her hasn't by any means be easy. Sometimes she had to go to the hospital because of her illness. Which I get I'd go visit her a lot when I was a teenager, like from school straight to the hospital which is quite far from my home. But the thing that pisses me off about this is she would just up and leave. Like one day you'd wake up and mum was gone like she would disappear from the house, wouldn't tell anyone and wouldn't answer her phone. You'd have to call the hospital to find out what ward she was on and if she was even admitted.  As a 12 year old this really messed with my head and I guess now I have abandonment issues and a long struggle with mental illness. But yeah moving on. Because if my mum's illness she can't work so she got benefits for me and my brother. But she was really bad with money and would try and buy us off to make up for all the messed up stuff she'd do. And it got to the point where I was 17 doing A Levels and my mum wouldn't give me any money like I had no money to buy food or anything. And I know I sound really entitled but I was trying to focus on my studies because I wanted to go to a good uni. So I just needed s bit of support. She'd always say she had no money but then buy herself lots of stuff. At this point I realized I was on my own now. So I got a job. I literally would go from school to work and then spent all my free time studying. It wasn't fun but I did what I had to do.
But then she started asking me for money which would annoy me because she's getting money from the government and she isn't giving my brother and me any of it so what is she spending it on? I've tried to help her but she just won't so now I don't bother. I just want to live my life a bit. My mum is ungrateful, she's done worst things but yeah. I do everything for myself since the age of 12 pretty much. But I don't want a relationship with her at all when she's around me I feel so angry like I can't breathe. My nan is not helping either.

TL;DR : I'm dealing with the shame and guilt following my hypomanic phase that sent my life into ruins. I need advice and kinds words. Thank you.

I recently come out from a hypomanic phase that lasted for about three months. It's my first time experiencing it and actually being aware of it. I've stopped seeing my therapists ever since I moved out of the country I was living in, where I was diagnosed for the first time last year. I did not get any insight from professionels, but I would love to hear your opinions.

I got diagnosed during my stay in a psych ward. It took a really long time to find the right treatment for I have stayed there for about two months. The weird thing is, I'm usually a very calm, quiet person who's in depression. That's how I've always seen myself, that was my identity during my teens to my early adulthood. I've only experienced hypomania briefly when I was prescribed an anxiolytic by a therapist only after one session, for social anxiety. That's what the doctors in the mental hospital based their diagnosis on for ""a bipolar disorder"". That's what they called it, they never specified the type.

I was also diagnosed with social phobia/general anxiety disorder. So I had to take anxiolytics again, mainly for my anxiety attacks and for my insomnia. The thing is, whenever I took my anxiolytics before my bedtime, I would get random busts of energy, my social anxiety would disappear completely, I would become hypersexual, and I would have a brain fog, much like drinking alcohol. Whenever I would wake up, I would feel guilt and shame. It was like that for a while until I got admitted again to the hospital for my panic attacks.

I stopped taking those anxiolytics cause I asked my doctor to prescribe something else. Until I was prescribed benzos, and this time the effect lasted longer. I was thrown into this hypomanic phase without me knowing. I liked how I felt under benzos. I felt confident, energetic, motivated, and I loved it. I went from being isolated to having an actual social life with people who actually wanted to be around me. I think that fueled my hypomania even more. But I never felt shame or guilt. I started becoming more and more impulsive, and had really unhealthy coping behaviors. I started smoking weed, and mixing that with benzos was the worst. Moving forward, I just became a really toxic person, I ruined many precious relationships in my life for being really impulsive and making the wrong decisions until I stopped taking my meds, isolated myself from everyone and stopped going to school. My parents took notice of how bad of a place I was in and decided to take me back home. I didn't say goodbye to anyone, I didn't even tell them that I was leaving for good. I still don't talk to anyone and I know they might be worried about me. But the shame and guilt that I feel make me very anxious and I don't have the guts to face them nor apologize for my past behavior.

If you've read the whole thing, thank you so much. I haven't opened up to anyone as much as I did right now. I might've left some important details, but it doesn't matter cause this is all I've been thinking about for the past few months following my hypomanic phase. The descent was brutal by the way. If you have any advice concerning anything, or just opinions, feel free to share them. Or just kind words, really. Anything.",12Jun2019,12

73,"It pretty much looks like I have quite severe physical symptoms when I get overly anxious. 

Last time it got serious, I was off from work for 2 weeks. It started with my extremites feeling numb, me losing focus, getting dizzy all the time and being confused slightly. Then came the vomitting, extreme sense of impending doom and insomnia. Of course I started worrying that something serious was happening to me, which only made thing worse.

74,"I (25 F) had EDNOS my teen years. I’ve been healthy about five years now, hard to pin down exactly you know, but about that long.

Last Fall, I was on a medication that made me gain some weight. Going from low-end of healthy BMI to high-end of healthy BMI. 

It hasn’t been bothering me too much (and stopped med and weight gain), but lately I’ve been thinking I would like to lose just ten pounds.

This would be helpful for my clothes. They don’t fit too great, and I can’t afford even thrift shopping right now.

But I realize it could be a dangerous slope. My weight gain bothers me in one aspect- during sex. I won’t let my SO touch my stomach anymore because it makes me feel unsexy to bring attention to it. So, saying I’m completely unbothered would not be truthful.

Also, I very well could be struggling with self-worth again. A few months ago we lost our home and moved in with family. That’s around when I started to want to lose weight.

I definitely could stand to lose ten pounds. But that’s how it started when I was 14- “just ten pounds,” “just twenty,” “just ten more,” etc.

What I wonder though, is if exercise would be safe. My ED was restrictive and purging. I never over-exercised, barely exercised at all. Tbh I’m pretty lazy haha. Always have been, physical work is just not appealing.

Dieting isn’t much of an option even if it were safe. I eat as healthily as I can afford and just what I need. Not much room to healthily improve unless I had more money. 

So, if I exercised some to lose weight- would that be safe? I very highly doubt I would ever over-exercise, I’m just too lazy. Buuut, would I be putting myself on a slippery slope toward restricting again? That’s what I worry about.

Many thanks.",12Jun2019,1

76,"Right now I have a decent job with good pay, the opertunity fell into my lap (which seems to happen alot.)
Im going on around 6 months now and I'm starting to hate it.

My dad always said that you just gotta turn your brain off and get Er done.. I can't turn my brain off. It's full throttle 100% of the time. I wouldn't say intrusive thoughts, but it's full of curiositys, ideas, and everything else besides the task at hand.. I do get distracted easy but I'm pretty good at staying on task. 

After around 6 months, even if I have a good job I start to find things that piss me off. All the shortcuts or small things an employer does gets under my skin. I feel like these are excuses that push me to quit or move on to somthing else.. 
I think alot of it has to do with tht repetitive days. I understand every job is going to be repetitive at some point. I hate the feeling of being ""trapped"" somewhere for 8+ hours a day to pay for all the stuff I need to pay for (plus now, there's debt so I'm extra stuck.). Again, that's part of adulting and I understand that. 

The pattern is what worries me, I don't think I have had a job for anything longer then a year. Somthing inside my head isn't right. I can't get on a schedule. I can't ""fall in line"". Really, if I could not work, I would not work. 
That doesn't mean I don't want to do stuff. I like building things, I like all sorts of hobbies.. My current job is, in a sense an extention of one hobby (a repetitive, repetitive hobby.) so it's not like I just want to do nothing. 

I can't seem to get away from the rinse and repeat job cycle and its only hurting me in the long run. I think it might be a mental issue. Somewhere in the gooy blob of a brain is the problem and I can't find it... (I have tried ADHD meds a bunch of times with various success. Mostly negative consequences however.)",12Jun2019,3

83,"Hello, 16 F, thank you so much for taking your time out to read this. 
I haven’t been diagnosed with depression, but my therapist says that I am having a major depressive episode. I saw my GP a few days ago and he mentioned to me that my counsellor, therapist and him had been talking amongst each other about me and he mentioned that they wanted to put me on medication.
I’m not against medication, if anything I’m willing to have a try at anything that could help me and my personal situation. However I slightly detested because I haven’t even had more than 5 sessions with my therapist yet (sessions which I feel like I get nothing out of) and it feels like to me that it’d be easier for them to put my on medication. I’d like to try out any other path, or have more comprehensive sessions with my therapist before medication. I don’t feel like I resonate with my therapist, and I leave sessions feeling weird and uncomfortable and like nothing has changed for the better, and she often has to postpone or reschedule appointments because she’s sick. I’m yet to communicate how I feel, and that I feel like the sessions are unhelpful to my therapist, but I would like a second opinion. Is it worth seeking out a new therapist? And maybe private? (I’m currently seeing a public therapist for a youth and adolescent mental health clinic.

I was doing very well in the beginning and everything was fine.

But then I completely fucked up one week. I had to turn in two assignments and I didn't have the books. I went to the book store but they were sold out. I really, really fucked up and talked to my professor and he decided to give me a zero for both projects. This single week pretty much doomed me and I failed.

And the online class, everything was fine. But we had to turn in two papers at the end for the final. And my professor sent me an email saying that I didn't understand the guidelines and that I was supposed to connect it to the readings. So I failed that class.

I entered grad school and I completely fucked up. I feel so ashamed and humiliated.

I want to continue my education and go back in the fall.

Can I just keep moving forward? I mean, so what I failed...I can still keep going and do my best and keep doing good in the world, right?

91,"I've been in therapy for about two years , got diagnosed with depression a year ago but it started getting worse a few months ago.
My therapist doesn't have an office , all her appointments are held in her living room , which definitely makes me more comfortable than being in a clinic. She's always been very sweet and understanding and I do think she's helped a lot . However , since I got my diagnosis , her advice just isn't helping me any more . Go out in the sun ? Take a walk ? Socialize? If I was capable of doing all of that , I wouldn't be here now. She has stated multiple times that she is against antidepressants. I've tried every nootropic you can think of - valerian, st. John's wort , everything.

She hadn't told me anything that bothered me too much , until now . She recommended I pick up a new language or a sport , so that I'd be in a group , socialazing . I told her that I simply can't do that , that's one of the reasons I'm in therapy anyway , I've never been able to work in a group . I don't know if it's social anxiety or just me being a loner , but it's just not happening. I told her that and she simply said , ""Why would you choose unhappiness over happiness?""

Seriously? You're the /one/ person who's supposed to understand me and give me actual advice . You think that I choose to be miserable every single day of my life ? What kind of professional says that ? 

I know I shouldn't take such things to heart , but when it's coming from someone like her , it really does make me mad . I don't have any ""friends"" that I consider to be trustworthy so I relied on her way too much. I'm seriously considering stopping therapy altogether , and just ""dealing with it"" for as long as I can .",12Jun2019,4

I've never really told anyone how I feel and it's the range to ask strangers on the Internet to help solve your problems.

For context, I am a 27 y/o Brit, work a decent job am single and have no kids.

I can't hold down a relationship due to being unstable (or atleast that's how my ex put it).

The only way to describe my emotions is by referring to them like a cloud that hangs over my head. Some days (a lot recently), it feels like it's always raining and is so cold and other days it's like the cloud is hugging me and everything is okay.

The dark days are getting pretty grim and I've started thinking about disappearing and not being here anymore.

Most days, I force myself out of bed, but have told myself that I'm going to save and move abroad - because running solves everyone's problems(?!)

97,"Okay, so some clarification before I post. Firstly, I ordinarily would avoid doing this. Social media and socialization period has never been my thing.

Secondly, I don't like people. So there's that.

And finally, thought there's probably other things that I've forgotten, which I always do, I don't think anybody can help me. I think I'm going to go around and around in this bullshit cycle of mine (oh, /there's/ one of the aforementioned reasons.) because I'll never change.

100,"I'm sick of this!

I was in a horrible relationship and got diagnosed with a physical ""ilness"" a few years ago when I was 19 and it ""unlocked"" something inside of me. 

After that period in my life I have so much more emotions that I at first could not handle, it is better now but I still get so frustrated when my emotional run wild. I'm also sensetive to everything: a badly worded comment, a look from a friend will have me believe I've done something wrong, loud music and intense light can cause me to cry and I'm so scared of people; what they might say or what they might think. I do not do coffee or alcohol anymore since that will get me so anxious that I'm unable to think clearly. Sometimes when I let this stuff go and just enjoy myself I know that I talk to much, I can see it in peoples faces but it gets so weirdly quiet if I stop talking

Worst part is that I'm a logical person, I hate ""accept your feelings"" talk. I have to know the reason behind then before I can let then go. All my closest friends are logical individuals, all my boyfriends has been that to. Over emotional persons just makes me upset and tired. When one of my friends were going through a depression I could hardly sleep for being worried about her. The only person I cry in front is my bf, it is impossible for me to hide my feelings from him. He always says that he doesn't mind because I can always explain what is happening in a way that he can understand, I can always find the logic behind the emotion. 

Do not let me start on TV and books. When I read fantasy too much or watch a tv series too much I will almost loose contact with reality. People in books and tv are so real to me. I can be devestated for days after a character dies and it took me 4 days to watch 30years a slave since I had mini meltdowns during the movie

I have been to therapy loads of time but all they have found is that I have GAD. My sister thinks I'm autistic, or that is at least what she has ""joked"" about the last 3 years and I sometimes believe her. I also have suspicion about being a HSP. But honestly, I do not want a diagnosis. I just want to be normal. To have people stop calling me over emotional.

109,"Disclaimer: I’m a cis(?), bisexual male in my early twenties. I’ll try to condense my feelings down a lot otherwise this become a wall of text. 

For about as long as I can remember I’ve suffered from body dysmorphia, specifically in regard to viewing myself as overweight and unattractive. I suffered from anorexia when I was a teenager because of this, and then I suffered from extreme depression and anxiety, and now I just suffer from anxiety with a small portion of depression on top. 

For a few months I’ve had some thoughts about myself, mostly regarding (you guessed it) whether I would be happier if I were instead female. Truthfully, I try to suppress it every time I think about it because I’ve been comfortable as a male my whole life (probably?). I also feel guilty when I think this way because I understand the pain people with genuine dysphoria go through. 

When I look at myself in a mirror, I’ve never been happy. I hate my face, my hair, my whole body. I guess my eyes are cool because they’re two colours. I wear light makeup to make my face look paler but it’s not enough.
I enjoy my clothing style, but I’m never confident when I wear all these clothes I own. I’m envious of women who look so damn cool when they wear artistic skirts and dresses.
Despite how much I love her, I constantly feel jealous of my girlfriend (disclaimer: bisexual as well) for how amazing she looks all the time and I wish I could I look as good as her. I’m happy she’s so beautiful and outwardly confidant, so I feel awful for feeling jealous of what she has. 

I feel like I’m using this idea as some kind of solution, like I’ll magically feel better and lose my dysmorphia if I were just a pretty girl that could wear quirky clothes and cute makeup and feel the confidence I’ve longed for. It sounds so fairytale and ridiculous, and I hate myself for subconsciously thinking this. 

I’m incredibly confused and desperate for answers. I want to feel confidant, but I don’t want to be wrong about what my true feelings are whether that goes one way or the other.

112,"I have a friend who has been depressed and suicidal for many years, most the time I have known him.  He suffered bullying all through his childhood and because of this believes everyone is always out to get him and no one cares about him when this is simply not true.  There is a group of 10+ of us, his friends, that are here for him and listen and try our best to help.

Lately he has been getting worse and worse.  7 months ago he was sending pictures of himself cutting to multiple people, myself included, and we had enough. We had a meeting with his parents explaining the severity of the issue, and they said they would work on it. Since then they have tried to get him into a program, he refused the help, and I haven't heard anything else from them since. Just this week his parents also canceled his cell service, and he just continues to spiral more and more.  

Because of this we have to help him ourselves. He is resisting it constantly, saying he doesn't want help and that we are threatening him.  We tell him we care about him but we can only do so much as friends, and he needs to get professional help.  He has tried medication and therapy in the past, not sure if he still does either.  He just vents to me daily (which I gave him full permission to do, say anything he needs to, etc) about how horrible his life is, how all he does is drink and smoke all day, yet won't let us help him. 

He has shared his Reddit username with me and I can't help but check it, and see him posting on subs like suicidewatch, foreveralone, etc, sayin he has no one in his life, everyone abandons him, and asking for help.  Just this morning he texted another friend saying ""I spent the morning cutting, probably ODd too"" and no other information, and when we offered to help him seek help TODAY, he said we were just threatening him and he doesn't need us in his life. I hate to say it's a cry for attention but more and more it's seeming that way.  

Should we attempt to get him involuntarily admitted to a psych ward? Our biggest worry is that he'll see it as us betraying him and he cuts us from his life or ends up actually killing himself because of it.

We have tried a couple different medications, PHP treatment (partial hospitalization), started seeing a therapist but due to restructuring with the facility I go to I lost the therapist after only three visits as she would now only be focusing on drug or alcohol addictions (of which I dont have). Since January she has tried to get a new therapist for me but the only one that was taking new patients was one I briefly had before (we didnt work well together). Apparently no one else is taking on new patients. Over the past few visits I have been disappointed with the way my psych nurse has been treating me for my PTSD, depression and anxiety. Its to the point that I dont want to be a patient with them anymore. The problem is they are all I have. No other psych doctors are taking new patients anywhere near me. My primary care told me that he will only treat me temporarily and not to rely on him for my mental health treatment. (I havent been happy with him either for my regular health and am looking at replacing him as well).

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my treatment is moving nowhere. Im not getting better, and if anything its only getting worse. Im not suicidal and am not really at the point where I need to be inpatient anywhere. Ive been on countless different medications since my mental health issues started back in 2012 and none seem to be very helpful. The only other thing I can think of to try is trying to see a doctor about medical marijuana. Ive never tried it, but have tried just about everything else to treat my mental health issues. What else could I do?",12Jun2019,1
114,"I stopped taking my medication two weeks ago. I was too broke and I felt resentment at having to spend my little spare money on meds, like I've been doing for 6 months now. I wanted to go out with my friends, I wanted a new pair of pants, after having 5 pairs of pants break on me this year. I wanted to buy fancy beer. I wanted to borrow the car from my mom and gas it to go to the beach. I didn't buy my meds.

And now I went and did it again. Not only did I want to kill myself today, but I lied about it at work. I said a friend tried to kill himself and I had to rush to the hospital. I cried and everything. I was so convincing. Inside I wanted to end my life. Not die, but end this life of being broke and mediocre and useless. Also, I was so mad about working under the table and having none of the worker's rights that should be provided to me by my country's laws. Like sick days.

I've taken only 8 sick days in 4 years. None of them paid, even though it's my right.

How can someone not go insane when they're getting fucked in the ass by their life each and every day?

I regret it now. But I got a free day at home, and I already did two loads of laundry and cleaned the kitchen. At least I'm being useful.

120,"I’ve never been diagnosed with anything but I just know I have CPTSD (stemming from CSA and an unhealthy childhood home which contained domestic violence among many other things - my mom even went to jail for attempted murder of my dad! 🙃) Ive had issues with anxiety, dissociation and self-loathing since I was a child. I went though a traumatic experience four years ago and I’m not sure if I developed severe depression from it or if it just worsened my CPTSD. My boyfriend left me due to me being unable to take care of myself and my personal hygiene. My poor mental health is now affecting me physically (I’m underweight, according to my BMI which is 16.6) since I don’t feel hungry and thus don’t eat or have trouble eating. 

So what I want to know is, is it even worth trying to get help? I’m questionable about it due to the large amounts of money it may require and also I’m sure part of my uneasiness regarding it is because of how scared I would be talking about my childhood. If I should get help, where would I even start? I don’t have a doctor and I don’t have insurance right now. I tried reaching out to a mental health facility for weeks (every time I call they never answer the phone. I received a call back and a voicemail once but after that they still never answered the phone) but I never spoke to anyone there about scheduling my “intake” so it makes me feel like these “professionals” don’t actually care.

123,"Dear Mental Health reddit members,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm brand new to this thread and rarely post anything on the internet in general.  Here is a list of some ongoing stressors in my life that I feel spread just a bit too thin to emotionally grapple with on my own:

&amp;#x200B;

1.)  My dad's in the hospital for the 3rd time this year for heart and other health issues. He had a debilitating stroke at the young age of 40, lost his job and the ability to provide for us growing up, and changed into a much quieter, less confident person. We went from upper-middle class to working-class for the rest of my childhood (about 10 years) in the seeming snap of a finger. Moved around and down-scaled a ton. The hospital visit before this one was the result of him, once again, not taking care of himself because he doesn't really want to. He had severe pneumonia he successfully hid for two weeks before he stopped being able to breath. He fainted, and the doctors found 80% heart failure in him due to how much fluid there was in his lungs, literally weighing on and preventing his heart from operating normally. Thankfully, his heart's chambers didn't harden for permanent damage and he made a fully recovery in a week. That was a month and 1/2 ago. Today, he fainted on his wheelchair-bound wife at a bus stop and went to the hospital via ambulance. He tried to get both his wife and the EMTs to call off the ambulance because it makes him so uncomfortable. We're all currently waiting for new information from doctors. While not strictly related to this health situation, they both live on social disability and have for the past 15 years.  So they don't have great insurance. I've already lost my mother, and this would be a lot for a 31 year old only child to handle (me). 

&amp;#x200B;

2.)  My long-term girlfriend (a very happy 5 years!!) has an eating disorder based on intense childhood trauma and abuse from her mother. She's gifted, frankly: just got into a top 5 grad school on a full ride, gorgeous and aesthetically WELL out of my league, makes her twice-a-week therapist laugh so hard she starts getting teary, and very accurately describes herself as ""the most hostile sweetheart you know."" I'd add charismatic and articulate to that. In addition to a therapist, she's seeing a nutritionist AND attends a 3-days-a-week intensive outpatient program from 8am - 12pm. She works full-time from home on those days and is still the most productive person in her office (she turned down a promotion they offered after she told them she got into grad school and they didn't offer the position to anyone else). So yeah, she's incredible, but understandably comes home sobbing after each outpatient session due to the nature of personal stories shared there and the very sight of required eating makes her very nauseous. NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT OFFER EATING DISORDER ADVICE/GUIDANCE/COMMENTS. She, and tangentially me, have all the professional help we need there.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) We're moving as a couple to the city she's going to grad school in! We've got the apartment locked for an August move-in, and we're excited about the area and have visited a few times. But we don't know \*exactly\* how to continue her food and talk therapy there. That's less of an issue, but she's so scared of slipping back into bad habits while learning and studying in a new place. 

&amp;#x200B;

4.) I was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder as a teen, but since my family didn't have health insurance at the time, I just had to deal with it. I've got decent coping habits for it specifically, but I don't currently have health insurance (just graduated grad school) and work freelance for now. I'm finding it increasingly more difficult to focus on my own work and passionate side projects while juggling it all. Since we're moving to different states, applying for assisted coverage via govt. programs in the state we're currently in would take too long to process (up to 6ish weeks), so I'm waiting post-move.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm not even sure what I'm exactly asking for beyond advice on how to ""feel better"" about the above. Death and health struggles are inevitable, it's just hard to deal with so much at once while making life transitions. Any ideas on how to make any of that smoother would be much appreciated!

124,"I’m 20 years old and diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Disorder. I take meds (which I am slowly trying to decrease) and continue my life/education. I had a really awful semester and it didn’t really go as planned. When it ended I realized that I had no personality. I don’t know how to explain it, I went through nasty depression from January - May probably due to stress from the Nursing Program I am in. I find it hard to talk to people, I feel so bland, and when I was once so funny and full of energy I feel like I literally have nothing to say - like I’d rather observe from now on than even talk. I just don’t feel like myself, I feel blank and withdrawn. I was really unmotivated to do anything but that’s slowly gone away, I just don’t know when or if my original personality will come back.

125,"Lately there was an incident on our school...
I (m/16) have been going on my PE class when I saw my friend (f/16) crying in front of our teacher, she didn't let her pass the class...
If felt bad for her and wanted to go check up if she is alright, but she has gone by...
The class is over...
I am on my English class when we all heared some kind of screaming and crying, we all went out when it went to a deaf punching...
She was beating her head at the wall, and that a much, it was blood on the wall and she was just crying and punching even more.... I was shocked, so shoked that I couldn't do anything.... She fell and passed out of the pain, we called an ambulance and they came and put her away. Believe me it was horrible: Blood on the wall, her Harry Potter like glasses destroyed and bloody on the floor, her teeth punched out by herself...
She was in the psychiatry for a week and she came back, the first thing I have done is hugging her ;{
But now it got worse, while she was away people started joking about her, being crazy and dangerous, told me to stop being a friend to her and so on...
She acts like she doesn't mind it, but I know how much it hurts her... Her friends she trusted now betraying her so easily :(
I have been doing my best to be with her and to help her, I have been arguing with people saying horrible things after her back and I am proud of it :) She is just great and I hope that she will go on ^^
But I have a question?
How shall I act about this, I don't know if it is right for me to put my nose into smth that doesn't is my business?

Not one of my ""friends"" invited me for jackshit. I don't know how tf am I gonna pass the 2 exams I have left to finish my degree. I don't feel the will to do it but my mind is contemplating suicide about 3/4 of the day. Even though I have a job and go to the gym, my perspectives are not good. Last weekend I got sick and a part of me just wanted to be taken out already from this place. They never mentioned it, but I know since the accident they live with the fear and the weight of not knowing if I'll make it to the end of the year. For God knows how many years. Because it's not like, the rest of your life is fine just get over that hand thing and you will be back on track. It never was everything fine since I was 3. I just really really fought tooth and nail to pursue my dreams, and I m exhausted, and I have no friends I can really count on, and I look to the big picture of things and I wonder, how long will I be able to hold on. How long will my family have to live with this fear. Why can't I just be a fucking normal happy person.

127,"I'm sure this has been mentioned hundreds of times on here, but finding support has been the greatest thing that I have done for myself and my recovery. 

I know it's not easy, it's far from that. It's insanely difficult to be vulnerable with others, especially with the fear of judgement/involuntary commitment, but if you set your boundaries and find others that will respect them, I can't even begin to express the amount of joy that it can bring you to be surrounded by people that want to help you achieve your recovery. 

I know how difficult it is to find a therapist that you can click with, let alone the cost, so if that isn't an option, and I know this may sound taboo if you don't have an addiction, there are a lot of open NA and AA meetings across the country with people who are more than happy for you to attend just for the support. I've personally been attending SMART recovery due to psychotropic drug withdrawal, and they are really amazing people. 

Like I said, I know it's difficult and even more so when you hardly have the motivation to do anything, but this is what personally has been saving my life for the past 8 years, and I just wanted to share it.

128,"So. This is kind of weird, but a couple of days ago I started feeling like I need to get this out of my system. A lot of these behaviors aren't new, in fact I can remember doing some of these stuff when I was like, like nine years old or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

It kind of started when I was 14. I'd been developing strange behavior before that, but I just seemed like a very shy kid. However, when I was 14, that's when I started being Very Online, and that's when it started to go downhill. I started at first with, you know, regularly stalking Twitter feeds of people who lived in my area. Standard internet behavior. I don't want to talk for too long, so I'm just going to say it got worse. I'd spend months locked up in my house stalking people on the internet. I'd check on them several times a day. I'd find their Instagram accounts, read every and each of  their interactions with other people, try to find out personal information. I don't know why I did it. I just did. A lot of the stuff I found out was pretty easy to find, but still.  I found out where their parents work. I found out about their families and relationships. I made fake accounts on social media and befriended them. And it worked for a while, so I spent even more time stalking them. It was that time I saw one of the girls I stalked -- I wished I could kind of be her friend, which is very fucked up -- that I kind of wanted to throw up. It was by complete coincidence, I didn't frequent places I knew she'd go to (I can barely answer the phone on my own without freaking out,) but she just happened to be in front of me. And oh my fucking God, it was horrible. I spend hours - actual hours, I'm not joking - walking around my house, headphones in my ears, daydreaming about a pathetic life where I could be friends with them. I'd be better with people and I'd be able to keep friends. I wouldn't be comforted by the thought that I might die and FINALLY be comfortable and at peace in a few years, or I wouldn't remember the fact that I have to live a lot more years of \*this\* and feels this horrible crushing weight on my chest that makes me feel like I can't breath.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even deal with people anymore without feeling so fucking angry or sick. I can't help but noticing how every literal gesture of mine or theirs is performative -- I mean I don't even know what I'm saying or doing half of the time. I'm doing something that I know the other party will perceive positively or negatively (depending on the reaction I want to get) and I try to establish a very manufactured presence through precise gestures and words to paint a particular picture for that person to get a desired reaction depending on what I observe from them. I'm not even real. And I know that everybody does this to a certain degree, of course, but I just take it to the next level. (Like what if I stopped to talk to that girl who I used to stalk when I saw her in real life? I could've said hi. I could've said stuff that I knew she'd find funny, or pretend to listen to bands she liked. I'd know what to say or do to make her like me.)  It's like I'm a gimmick or something. Most of the time I want to crush a glass or something just take a handful of shards and squeeze my fist around it and I just keep thinking about how good will that feel, to see all that blood and feel that amazing pain

132,"So I posted on AITA with the question if I'm an asshole for ignoring texts. People in the comments were saying I had social anxiety and I do see someone for other things, but my question is; do I really need help? Because, do I really have 'social anxiety'. I always thought that what I had is what everyone has and that social anxiety is far from what I thought I was: just awkward and stupid. I'll try to give some examples?
For exanple: I homeschool (school was too much) and sometimes my mom asks me to get some sandwiches at the local bakery. I usually try to avoid this, because I think that the woman at the bakery probably finds me weird and unhealthy because I come there a lot, but when there is no avoiding it: I'll go. My mom asked me to get two breads (a type I don't know the English word for) and she wanted a specific type of sandwich. I get there, she asks me what I want and normally there were papers on this specific spot with all the sandwiches there was and the name of them and my mom asked a sandwich I was sort of sure about was one made at the bakery, but not completely sure about. So I panick and I had agreed that if it wasn't there I would get her one we were both sure of was made there. And I didn't want to ask if it was there because she might find that annoying (she is really kind, though) if it wasn't there and I didn't want her to have that. I felt that if I asked it and it wasn't there I would have done something terrible but I can't say why. So, I ask her the one my mom and I agreed on if they didn't have it and also order mine. I also have trouble talking loudly bc I don't want to say anything or do anything that could be wrong. If they ask me anything I panick and almost always say yes. (For example: I picked the wrong thing in another store and they could notice it but I didn't want to say bc they might get mad and they would need to do extra work. Or this once she made the wrong thing and I could have stopped her and said: Oh no I meant this. But, I didn't cauz I was too scared.)  Then I order the bread but I can't see the name on the shelves and I was too scared to ask her and have her not having it so I ordered a different type. While I was looking I also noticed the list with types of sandwiches in a different place and it did have the one my mom actually wanted and I felt so stupid, which I was. And then it's all done and this is something that also always stresses me out: You need to get your items in the beg, pay and put it back in the wallet and I never want to make it slow, always do it as fast as possible bc I don't want to annoy anyone but (even though I can see I am not slower then other people) I always think I am super slow and annoy everyone and when I was walking back I just wanted to cry while also thinking that everyone that saw me was thinking I was ugly bc the wind blew my hair out of my face, which just makes me look really ugly. And this is basically how most of my trips to the bakery go. Or trips to the shop. Or going shopping for clothes. Or being at a party. Or how it was for me at school. But, do I actually need help? Because, sometimes when I step over some kind of barrier for a couple of seconds I can be really confident. And is this 'social anxiety', because isn't this what everyone thinks about? 
Sorry this is so long.
Sorry for asking advice.
Sorry if this is a post not meant on here.

136,"I'm really not sure if these two things are just something people with mental health issues face or if it's more common.

1) Delayed reward systems. They kinda worked when I was a kid, nowadays I feel like most rewards aren't even worth 1/5th of the hassle of getting to them. Goes into Sunk Cost Fallacy territory more than anything else. Ideally I'd need to receive a considerably large reward for medium effort max for me to stay invested and with time it just gets worse no matter what I do. In the end nothing in life really feels worth putting effort in when in the end the reward (if there is even any) is so miniscule it's like wanting to sell your PS3 and you're offered 12 bucks.

2) Doing things on repeat burns me out. Exercise is a good example. First few times (mild exercise) make me feel great afterwards and I feel like doing a bunch of things. With time, I quickly don't get a boost out of it anymore until I'm exercising and it just feels like a chore. Then I stop and take a long break. Cycle begins anew. Happens with almost anything I try to do regularly - always ""burn out"" really fast regardless of intensity of the task as long as I begin to do something regularly, all I can think of (after like a week max) is when this will be over. Even hobbies. Need a huge break from all things in my life regularly or I end up hating the thing or at the very least totally losing my interest. Kinda like gum that's veen chewed that it completely lost its flavor and is stale. I just don't understand how anyone can do things regularly and not feel tired of it, how people can do something regularly and still wake up the next day and be like ""hell yeah, I can't wait to do that thing again!""

137,"I feel trapped with the life I have.
In theory I should be happy with everything I have. I have a good job that pays decently. I am close with my family, and am still in my small hometown, so I still have a few good childhood friends. And I have a loving boyfriend who helps out at home, although he does work lots, leaving my kinda lonely. 

I don’t want to be here anymore tho. I thought by this point in my life I’d have done some traveling and have learned about myself a little. I didn’t think I would still be living in the shitty little town I grew up in, and be in a serious relationship, without any hope for leaving in the near future. Both my bf and I have too good of jobs that it would be foolish to quit for no reason. And my bf doesn’t want to leave even if we could, because his family is here. 

I miss being my own person, and not having to worry about anyone else in my decisions. I don’t get to go out dancing anymore, or have anything exciting happen to me whatsoever. I don’t think I could leave my bf over something as little as “missing the single life” type thing. I might enjoy myself for a little while but I would regret my decision I think. 

I have struggled with depression for my whole life. It’s better to the point where I no longer cry every day anymore. But now I have this internal struggle of trying to convince myself that I am happy with my life. I can’t really share this with anyone either. And I’ve brought up with my bf that I want to move somewhere or do something, but he doesn’t get any vacation, and he wants me to wait a couple more years before we move for his work to slow down.

Seriously, for some reason, all these people who are 'aware' of mental health and the stigma do the worst. It was actually the people who were the least versed in mental health that listened. They understood these are waters they're unfamiliar with, so they listened.

I’m so angry that I’m always crying and shaking because I can’t do anything about it.  I’ve been a victim of child abuse, sexual assault, and whatever I tell myself to fuel my self-pity and hatred.  People are dead because of me, I’ve had a man on top of me strangling me and I had to flip him off me and stab his neck.  I’ve given money to friends with addiction problems and lead them to their deaths unknowingly.  Everyone has everybody else’s back but my own.  I want to be a decent human so bad, and contribute to society, and I’m scared.  I’m so angry and depressed, I can’t sleep, eat, or bathe regularly.  I make pathetic excuses for myself to not pay bills or do any work.  I’m a toxic leech and I can’t do anything to change that no matter how hard I try.  I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m scared.

However, I do miss social media. I know I shouldn't, but it's a form of communication and it can be an addiction. However, other Redditors (not all of you) seem to find fault in whatever I comment.

I look over and of course he's moving again. I don't seem to want to do anything as well. Maybe it's the medication I'm on, mirtazapine 30mg.

I’ve called around and all I’ve found is that I can’t get into a psychiatrist for months, and evals/neuro testing will cost me anywhere from $1,500 to $3500.

I’ve been going on highways block parties downtown etc with little to no anxiety 

My GAD is still really bad but I’m working on it 

Monday I had a panic attack over taking my benzo to get to my psych appointment 
They switched my Xanax to Ativan which I have a med phobia 

I felt like I lost the only medicine that helped me ever if I needed too

I never took my Xanax at Home but always had it just in case you know 

Last night I woke up gasping for breath again something I haven’t had since 7? Months ago now when I mentally broke down

So I know it’s bad because I only get that under extreme stress

Today I was supposed to go get bloodwork done shouldn’t have been an issue because it’s in my safe zone
And an ekg not in my safe zone

I had a massive panic attack bad took my first Ativan it didn’t work as well as Xanax and I’m still very anxious 

I’m afraid my panic attacks are back :( 
I don’t know what to do everything seems to dark

I’ve been moving so far in getting better but I feel like I can’t move on right now due to these panic attacks

I’m doing my CBT and my next therapy appointment is Tuesday 
Hoping I can get my ekg before my appointment that day 

And my bloodwork Saturday

Today lots of people graduated, just like me 4 years ago, but I feel I don't progress as much as others. I'm really having difficulties keeping up with my studies. Besides that, taking a look at my old pictures graduating I'm wearing baggy clothes, joggingpants, while most people are having those perfect Instagram pictures and are all fashionably dressed while they are 4 years younger than me. And it makes me depressed really. I know it sounds stupid and exaggerated but that's the reason I know something is wrong with me, mentally. I'm getting depressed a few times a week of things like that, always comparing myself to others, never satisfied, having no goals in life. I can't pause life while I want to. I love life but I feel like I didn't live my life the way it had to be lived. And I can't turn it around. I'm 21. I feel so dumb and stupid.

150,"BACKGROUND: I'm 19 years old and I got diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety when I was either 15 or 16. I had a great few therapists but recently had to leave because I had to go to college. I used the campus counselors and they helped some but now it's summer and a lot of my symptoms are coming back strong. (I'm on Lexapro and Buproprion but cognitive therapy helped me the most.) 

One of the biggest problems I'm having right now is the lack of structure in summer combined with this sense of lockdown whenever I expect something to happen within the next few days. If there's a plan, it's like I can't do anything because I might be unprepared, I might forget the thing, etc. But it's mostly illogical anxiety that's the problem. I can't even fully describe the feelings but it's like this fear that I won't have the right amount of time to do the thing so I might as well wait until I have ""the right time"" (which never comes). 

Even something as simple as knowing my mother is coming home this afternoon has kept me from doing anything but TV/Reddit all day. It's infuriating. And I'm anxious because I know my parents are expecting me to do things like the dishes, the lawn, the cat litter, even just ANYTHING productive. I have had a history of a bad emotional relationship with one parent which definitely affects me and causes perfectionism and procrastination issues (which is probably why this lockdown is happening as well). 

Do you have any tips to jumpstart motivation, or how to make a structure for the summer and get myself on it?",12Jun2019,1

Last night I cried about water. It's been miserable and all I ever want to do is sleep.

152,"Last week I went to CSU (Crisis Stabilization Unit). I was at risk of hurting myself and others so I forced my parents to take me and I stayed there for three days. During my time there I was seen by a nurse and a worker daily to check up on me. It was honestly really nice. I don't care if they're paid to pretend to care, but having someone who really cared about what I had to say was nice.

My parents weren't too happy with the fact that I hurt myself. Obviously. They put in new rules like I have to be more open towards them. I did not want to come home because I was scared of the reprocussions I was going to face. I honestly still don't feel safe here. There's something about this house that makes me feel weird.

It's weird. At the CSU I slept like a baby. Everywhere else I sleep that's not in my bed, I sleep fine. Whenever I do sleep in my bed, however, I wake up in the middle of the night a couple times. I take sleeping pills, so I should be out all night, right?

Idk. I just feel weird right now.

Oh, it also doesn't help that my therapist almost tried to kill me. She's the one who put me on meds that made me suicidal. Hell, I'm still feeling suicidal and I'm not taking those meds anymore. I would stop seeing her but I can't, I need an injection that only she can provide me.

I hear voices. I've been diagnosed with Schizoaffectice disorder. It's schizophrenia mixed with mood disorders, such as depression and/or anxiety. I have both, unfortunately. These voices are telling me to kill myself every day now. Even more so without my injection.

Ugh. I'm turning 20 in a month, and I don't feel like I've accomplished anything. I'm worthless, at least, that's what I'm being told. My voices are always negative unless I'm at work, then they help me count stock.

I want to die. I seriously want to die. I either want to go back to CSU and stay there for longer, or overdose on my pills and not wake up tomorrow. Im just done with life.

Idk. Sorry for complaining. I know people have it worse than me. I just needed to rant I guess. I know nobody's gonna read this long text wall anyway, so what's the point of even posting it? Idk.

153,"I didn't realize it until I asked him to write a letter for my study abroad program (to get through customs with my medication). Now, he is not a shitty psychiatrist or shitty professional. Well, I guess he has diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder a while ago. :/

We did talk about the ways where I DO share similarities with BPD, but we didn't talk about an official \*diagnosis\*.  He did say that my therapist would know me better (she doesn't think I have BPD), but that was his professional opinion. I have no idea what this means to me, or if it should mean anything. Why would someone diagnose someone if they think that a therapist would give a better answer? (I can't understand why he would diagnose, since he isn't reporting it to the insurance money for coverage. I have anxiety and depression already).

A while ago, I was uncertain if I had BPD, and talked with my therapist, who said that I don't. But now...

That's a really stupid diagnosis if it doesn't mean anything for my treatment. Then again, he did put me on a mood stabilizer, but I thought that was just for my depression. ugh.",12Jun2019,1

I can’t sleep at night, because all these thoughts of why people must not like me floor my mind. So I do sudoku and other little things until I am so tired I fall straight asleep.
