1,"I was on an anti depressant and switched to another one that might help, it might still be taking a while to kick in but I feel angry and ""done"" all the time. But for some reason, I can't explain I'm not interested in getting it fixed. I wouldn't say I'm happy or like that, I'm angry, bitter and irritable, but I also kind of enjoy.

2,"A very close friend of mine is struggling mentally and has been for many years but has never really opened up to me (or anyone) about it until now. 
He says he needs to figure it out on his own, but he just doesn’t know how to. When I try to help, he says he doesn’t want to lean on anyone. He also doesn’t get too deep about it so it’s hard to understand. He says he can’t explain it; it’s just a deep feeling he has. From what he has said about it is that he doesn’t feel happy with himself and like he isn’t a good person - which isn’t true at all. In my eyes, he’s the most down to earth person I’ve ever met, but me telling him that of course isn’t going to change how he sees himself. I just wish there were something I could do or say. It hurts me a lot to know he’s feeling this way. 
Does anyone have any advice?",31May2019,7
3,"I’ve been changing medications recently due to the fact that it just wasn’t working anymore and I’m have suicidal thoughts that I haven’t had in 5 years. I know it’s because of how much we’ve been messing with my meds. I’ve been decreasing from 160mg of Geodon to eventually none and starting Abilify. I went down to 40mg and I was on it for about 2 nights and I did not tolerate it well at all. So I saw my Dr. and he decided to bump me back to 80mg and increase the Abilify to 20mg. It’s just gotten worse, I’m not depersonalizing anymore but honestly I’d take that any day over this shit. Like I said I haven’t had suicidal thoughts for 5 years and it’s scaring me so much because I don’t remember what they feel like or how to deal with it. And it’s  not even thoughts that I’ll do it or I should do it, just the fact that I could and I have the means in my house to do it. I’m not wanting to right now but I’m scared at some point I will and I’ll act on it. The phrase I’m in a downward spiral keeps running through my head. I was bad on the Geodon, having psychotic episodes, couldn’t look in mirrors, couldn’t speak when I was alone because I was scared of my own voice, I almost always thought I wasn’t real. That’s gotten so much better but this shit is popping up now and I’m scared. I’m just praying to God that this is just my brain being fucked up because of all the messing around we’ve been doing, and that once it evens out it will get better.",31May2019,3
4,I was carrying my niece because she was tried and then my mind immediately went to some creepy intrusive thought on whether or not I'm being creepy by carrying her. I was just walking with her and then BOOM creepy question. Logically I know that all I'm doing nothing weird or wrong but I hear these thoughts or see these creepy images and I feel like I'm some kind of molester. Honestly sometimes I feel so tired and its easier to not interact with my triggers.,31May2019,1
5,"I was laid off from a job that I truly loved just over 2 months ago. The job was at a guitar company (guitar is one of my main hobbies). They laid me and many other people off so I don’t think it was personal. I landed another job since then and have been working there for nearly 2 months. It’s a press company, and it’s really not that bad. 
I thought I was out of the weeds when I landed the job but honestly the job kinda sucks. I’m not good at what I’m doing, and I’m enduring quite a bit of ridicule from my boss. It’s nothing I can’t handle, but it still bothers me. 
I’ve never been truly depressed I don’t think. I’ve always tried to make the best of what I have and believe me I’ve been trying with this new job and new environment, but lately I just cannot find a way to be happy. I know that my situation is pretty fortunate, I am paid fairly and It’s full time but I am just so bummed about losing that job I loved.  I know that so many people never work at a place they love in their whole life and I’m so glad I had the opportunity to work at a place I actually loved. 
I need encouragement from my fellow reddit users. There’s an infinite pool of people that have it way worse than me but jeez, I just really need to be encouraged!

6,"I don’t really know what to put here. I just want to say what’s on my mind about my current situation which, fortunately, is no where near as bad as it has been or as bad as other people’s situations. 

I find myself in a loop. My depression and anxiety comes back in strong waves every so often, recently I’ve been going through about 2 weeks of just constant negative thoughts. Not feeling wanted or appreciated, hating myself, my appearance, my job, my home, constantly being out of money. Instead of doing anything productive about it, I do nothing. I go to work, come home, order a takeaway for dinner and eat it in bed watching YouTube, regretting the takeaway I’ve just ordered. This is after I bought food from the restaurant at work, sweets and other snacks during the day and again on the way home from work. 
Every time I’m in one of these spirals, I almost double my food intake and stop walking to work and going to the gym. I do nothing. My existence pretty much comes to an end in that period. 
I need advice. If any of you have suggestions as to how I can keep in a solid routine with walking to work and the gym I would appreciate it. That way I can see if it works for me. Even just ways to find reason to get out of bed in the mornings so I’m not laying there until I NEED to get up for work. Any advice would be really appreciated 🙂",31May2019,1
7,"I just joined subreddit so I'd like to just talk about me.  
I suppose I'll start what I've been diagnosed with. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Bipolar, and Mild Autism Spectrum Disorder. My mood is always meh, depressive, or angry. It's been so long since I've been happy. And pretty much anything can set off my anxiety at this point.

I've struggled with these things all of my life really. I first noticed my depressive behaviors in 4th grade, but I know I've had panic attacks as far back as pre-k. I only found out I have Mild ASD a couple weeks ago, but my mom said I was diagnosed with it as a kid.   
My triggers for anxiety are things like large crowds, loud places, new environments, getting yelled at (or just someone raising their voice or have authority over me), any mention of my dad, and things like that. I also get irritable for basically no reason the majority of the time. I think that's just the bipolar though.   
I am on a lot of medicine for my anxiety, as well as mood stabilizers. I am supposed to see a counselor every week but it's so difficult. It's such a bother and we don't have a car. We have to take a step bus (idk if other places have it, it's just public transportation basically). I haven't seen her in a month, and I haven't seen my psych doctor either.

8,"I don't really post on Reddit much, forgive me. I've been struggling with excessive thoughts of suicide for years now. I'm 19 now, and I think I'm at the end. My constant mood is just angry, tired, and just not present. Im always thinking of where I'd rather be, or what I'd rather be doing. I could be home alone wishing I was with a friend at a park or something, but if I went out I'd just be wishing I was home. Nothing makes me content anymore. It's not even about being happy. I just want to feel okay. I want to feel like I have a reason to fight. I want to be able to love my friends and family and not just hide away in annoyance in my room. I have good insurance, but no psychiatric facility near me takes insurance. It's always $300 just for consultation, and then $200 every appointment after that. Idk.

An example: deep down I think my skin is impenetrable. I know for a fact this is untrue, I've needed stitches a few times and I had a problem with cutting myself for a long time in my youth (partly due to numbed emotions partly due to this delusion). The problem is, unless I'm actively bleeding my mental go to is that my skin is unique and impenetrable. I can tell myself all day long that it's not true, i can give myself examples where I've proved the delusion wrong... but this belief remains. 

This particular delusion doesn't really affect my life, as I don't take risks based on it anymore... mostly just curious if I've ""beaten"" this delusion or if they are supposed to go away entirely? I haven't brought it up to my therapist as we've been working on more imortant things, not sure if i ever will tbh. Should I?

12,To give you a little background I am seen as the funny guy in a group and am always joking around. I’m not saying that to say that I am this great comedian. I am mostly sarcastic and for me it makes it hard for me to feel like anyone ever takes me anything other than a joke. I don’t feel like anyone would want to be in a relationship with me because I am such a joke. I know that be sarcastic probably stems from insecurities. Anyone got any advice?,31May2019,1
13,"I found Reddit about a year ago, maybe less. And the best way to put it was that it was extraordinarily refreshing. While I knew I wouldn't agree with everything on here, almost everything I read was so much more coherent and well-structured than about 80% of what I read on other social media sites. I felt like I could have a proper debate here, learn something from someone I disagreed with, make so much more progress than in a place like the Youtube comment section. And for a while, that was the case. The site overall was lowered in my eyes after a few incidents, but nothing too bad.

Over the past few days, however, things have suddenly felt worse.

I think it started when I grew into the habit of scrolling to the very bottom of news subreddits, which has been going on for a while. Because I found myself wanting to see something controversial and poorly informed, which the bottom comments usually were. This is where I admit it: I'm addicted to arguing online. It's not that I'm hoping to win; I learned a long time ago that that is next to impossible. But maybe... maybe I could get through to them. Maybe I could at least get them to open up to a new idea, to at least accept something different. And over the years, even before Reddit, there are times where I believe I succeeded. That's what I set my sights on. I ended up creating a minor set of rules in my head; Don't act smug, for smugness is meant to hide insecurity, thereby inadvertently revealing it. Don't just counter their arguments; dissect them as well. Point out where they may have delivered an unintentional message. If you're repeating yourself, switch to another point. Boil it down to an ""A + B = C"" format, showing how they're actually arguing ""A + B = B"", and bring up how that means A is 0 and therefore making it an incomplete argument in the first place. Etc. I didn't always follow these rules, but hindsight proved to be the best lens for teaching myself. And again, Reddit seemed like the perfect place for that sort of thing.

But over the past few weeks, and especially the past few days, I feel like I've been involving myself in more and more arguments. I don't know if it was an accident, but earlier this week I stumbled upon two or three comments that I couldn't resist engaging. Plus on Youtube, out of nowhere someone replied to a dissension I'd made seven months ago, leading to yet another argument. Most of these also had that kind of condescending tone, the kind that should signal to me that the speaker is only their to reaffirm themselves, nothing more.

It was over these few days of arguing that I was getting more and more aggravated. The arguments ranged from something as intense as talking down a racist line of thinking to something as insignificant as the specifics of game controllers. And as I lost more and more patience, I started ignoring those rules I'd set up; I started getting smug, getting stuck in argument loops, as I call them, where both sides end up only rewording the same points over and over again. I became (or maybe more appropriately, ""I've become"") what I promised myself I'd avoid at all cost. I'd fallen for it, more than ever before. And that's where I started feeling shame, and worse, a panic, which came on whenever I was informed that something was in my inbox. And funnily enough, half the time it turned out to be completely harmless.

And then one of these arguments led to one particular subreddit: r/iamatotalpieceofshit. I'd heard of it before, maybe even looked at it, but it hadn't stuck with me. It was in this heat of replies that I found myself really absorbed by the page. Yesterday and today, I visited almost each post and looked through the comments.

This led to two habits that scared me. One: I discovered soon enough that almost each post held comments that almost defended the subjected POS of the post. On one hand, some of it was along the lines of prejudice. Transphobia especially appeared to be upvoted more than usual. I don't even identify as trans, but it scares me how much some of those arguments echo arguments of the past decades and centuries. But on the other hand, in hindsight, I'm not even sure how much of it was as bad as I thought. Either way, I realized it had become difficult to assume the best of a commenter, to assume that they weren't being radical or even irrational. I was already becoming aware that my mental state was getting messed up, but I was also so angry that I wanted to find that *gratifcation.*

Which takes us to the second habit: As the name of the subreddit implies, it's for posting footage of the worst of the worst. People who beat innocent bystanders, a creep who followed a woman to her apartment, posters celebrating the dehumanization of groups, etc. Not only was I losing faith in humanity; the anger I'd built up over all that arguing was directed at those people as well. I couldn't interact with them directly, of course; but I found myself imaging what if I had. Several times I did this, and several times I had to pull out, because I realized it wasn't a healthy practice. I convinced myself that as long as I brought myself back to reality, I wasn't going over the edge. 

Then came the case that managed to convince me. There was a post that showed a commenter explaining that they found it fun to randomly kick people from severs with their moderator privileges, essentially ruining their game. A very POS thing to do, yes, but not the worst of crimes. Still, I found myself in another fantasy. I imagined myself seeing them on their laptop, saying something cheesy like ""You know what else is fun?"" and then smashing their laptop. Then I imagined them getting upset, maybe lunging at me, giving me the excuse to fight back. And let's just say that is when I realize I was in deep trouble.

I don't know if this is just me. I've searched a couple of times, to see if there were other people who were having issues like this. But searches like ""get me off reddit"" only gave me existing subreddits that had nothing to do with my dilemma. I don't know if this is only because I've had much more free time on my hands, with it being summer break between college semesters. I've been trying to keep busy. I have a job, I have a game I want to keep updating, I have books to read, relatives to visit, and that's only stuff I'm actually doing, ignoring everything else I want to do, like practicing drawing, keep in contact with friends, writing, etc. But then I see the latest news post on another ridiculous thing Trump did, and I feel the heat rising again, and the ego that refuses to settle down, that keeps me up until two in the morning.

Now, I want two things clear: I don't want to drop Reddit completely. Despite all I've said, there are things worth salvaging, things that have improved my mental health, I believe. I follow several art subreddits that inspire me. I'm kept up to date on world events more than ever. There are subreddits based on writing and reading fiction that I want to contribute to someday; but my writing energy gets tapped out on explaining something I've explained a hundred times before.

The other thing is that I don't want this to be about my actual history. Whether or not I stand by what I said I still have to decide; but not here. I don't want this to become about politics. That might not stop you (especially considering that, whether I like it or not, transgenderism may be a touchy subject here), but please, *please,* just don't. I'm sick of it for one post. All I want to know is how do I break this vicious cycle?",31May2019,1
14,"I’m 41(m) I’ve spent most of my adult life trying not to think to deeply about myself or any problems. Sometimes I think there is something wrong with me as other people seem to obsess about their decisions and the way other people say things to them, while I never think about such things. 
But I am at a changing point in my life and I have to think about the past. I did stupid petty bad things (nothing major. Theft and drugs mostly) and I left the town I grew up in and went to the other side of the planet. I’ve always been law abiding hard working and try to be nice to people. 
But I buried the guilt and shame of my past for so long that I never feel like I deserve anything.

15,"My friend which ill now refer to as Gabe, who I've known since middle-school has come to me recently venting about his parents. ([https://imgur.com/a/5MS0lem](https://imgur.com/a/5MS0lem)) Gabe can't get them to change because they just get even angrier at him. One of his brothers (Who may I add has sucked up to his parents his whole life) is going off to college soon and is also scared to talk to his parents. His other brother hasn't sucked up so much but is afraid to talk because he might get kicked out. Gabe is a smart kid and gets A's and B's in the Californian School System (which might I add is FULL of low wages and old hags that don't give a shit.) but still, his parents couldn't give less of a crap. He's lucky if he can be online for 3+ hours because he can be ""Doing more useful things than playing video games"", and if they catch him online at all they give or remind him about his timeframe and get angry for zero reason.

So, I've recommended to him that he call Child Protective Services. His own parents fail to see that they're driving their youngest son to depression, but he believes this is going too far and has refused to call.

17,"Hey, anyone who takes the time to read this. Im desperate for some advice here, because at this point, I feel like im losing it. Im so stressed and anxious right now, i feel like im constantly on edge. I feel like (and have been told by a few of them), that my friends and loved ones are being pushed away due to my constant snappiness, and Anxiety. Im constantly on edge. All of the anxiety relievers that would normally work for me just arent cutting it. I feel like even my S.O hardly wants anything to do with me at this point. Hell, im starting to just give up, and give into the fact that im a lost cause.

For background, im in the middle of moving to a new house right now with my S.O, starting a new position at work, and working over time to help pay off the fact i just wrecked my new car last Thursday. Ontop of that, its the new car my s.o and i got together, because my credit isn't great right now, and im just paying him back as i can (he sold one of his cars to help me, when my other car broke down past repair) . Oh, and i got a ticket for the wreck im also paying off (my car spun out of control on wet pavement, and i wrecked into a fence, and truck on the other side of said fence). Oh, did i mention my S.O got a ticket for speeding in a school zone (school has been out in this school for 2 weeks) whilst taking me to work because the car i wrecked is un-drivable? 

I feel like an idiot for sitting here and playing the ""woe is me"" game, but Im seriously a mess right now, and im not sure how much longer i can take this. My body aches from the whiplash. Im feeling so paranoid and anxious. Im feeling awful that ive wrecked the car we got together. I tried so hard to stop, but i couldn't stop sliding and im trying my best to help work on it, but im no help at all (s.o is an ex mechanic). His female friend is helping is repair it as well, and i feel like a complete moron and ogre compared to her. She knows so much about cars, and it pretty to boot, and all my overweight self can do is hold thd flashlights and feel like a complete burden. A stressed, depressed, burden. She has told my s.o im making her feel unwelcome because of how just utterly shit i am to be around. Im jealous of her, and she can feel it. Im jealous that she's able to be so calm, and collected. And i can tell my s.o is enjoying her company much more than mine at the moment, which is understandable with how im acting. 



I used to be fun, and relaxed, and happy. I just want so badly to be back to the person i was before. Before my past trauma (pre S.O), and before all of this mess. I just want to have friends and not push them away, and to not fear that everyone has an alternative motive. I just want to feel beautiful again, and like my s.o is proud to have me by his side. I want to be calm so badly. Im just dying to feel ok again. Before stress and anxiety ruined the me i used to love.

&amp;#x200B;

i saw my psychiatrist today, had a great time, she gave me a gift today and made a plan for me that i completely agree with. the list of my current mental diagnosis's is schizophrenia, PTSD, schizoid personality disorder, severe depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and psychopathic tendencies, among many physical disabilities (12+)

&amp;#x200B;

something my psychiatrist wants to help me with is becoming social, i have no friends, and my only blood family member alive is my father. struggling with SPD (schizoid personality disorder), its hard for me to become social, but i tried to talk to my dad a few times today and was met with nothing but disrespect from him, which is usual.

&amp;#x200B;

ive had 26+ tumors removed in the past 12 years, and i have an appointment monday to get a special check up at a university ive been going to for 10 years since local hospitals and specialists wont see me because they feel they dont have enough experience with this type of tumor. the tumors are occuring in multiple places in my face and brain often, they reoccur very fast in multiple numbers, and the only option to save my life is checkups and surgeries.

&amp;#x200B;

i asked my dad for a ride to the university monday since my PCP doctor thinks hes sure my tumors came back again. bus, taxi, or uber are not an option because the distance is too far and im not allowed to drive because of Epilepsy. 

&amp;#x200B;

he cursed me out so bad because he wanted to go see his friend on monday at that time in the morning (makes no sense to me), and i told him ive been waiting for this appointment for 3 months because its so hard to get in there, it cant be rescheduled or id have to wait long again (potentially fatal for me). 

&amp;#x200B;

i heard my dads new wife talking about he doesnt need me, he only needs her, that I dont matter to her or their lives. she doesnt treat her 2 daughters that way at all. so later on my dad bought a box of KFC, i ate one drum leg, and he decided to throw the entire bucket all over my room saying i ate it all... wtf? i ordered us 3 subs from delivery and he threw all 3 of the subs in the trash. 

&amp;#x200B;

ive been dealing with his temper my entire life... IM REACHING A SNAPPING POINT RIGHT NOW... anger is something that i never feel and i bottle it up everytime, right now im about to explode... i havent said a word to them 2 since the incidents, im not feeling or acting right right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

long story short... my mom abandoned me as a child, then kidnapped me one day when i was 9, i ran away from her and came back to my dad from 3 counties away. when i was growing up... when my dad lost everything to 2 nasty divorces... i slept in the car with him. ive always had his back... there was literally an incident when a group of people surrounded my house when i was 15, they all had guns and were trying to break in, my neighbor and me stood outside the house with a shotgun and an AR15, my dad was hiding inside really. i fear almost everyday the day that my dad will pass away because no matter what happened to the both of us, he was all i had.

&amp;#x200B;

i recently got out of prison 6 months ago, i have 14 felonies on my record... and i dont want to do anything stupid. my dad is not my dad anymore, his new wife is changing who he is, and its terribly effecting my mental health for the worse.

&amp;#x200B;

ive tried to commit suicide 2 times while in prison, and this is the first time ive thought about it since...

21,"Hey everyone, my name is Si. I just feel like I need to put my thoughts out somewhere where others can see them. I don't expect any profound wisdom or such.

I am a 16 year-old male, and I have not been diagnosed with any disorders, nor have I ever sook professional help. But over the course of the last few years I feel like there has been something wrong with me, something eating away at my very self. I never really talked about it until now, mostly because I felt guilty that I was feeling this way while others had it so much worse, or that no one would care because my problems seemed so insignifigant, or afraid that I might just be a completely fine teenager and waste everyone's time. But I feel like I'm getting worse, and I need to vent.

Up until about the 9th grade I never noticed any irregularities, and although I was and always have been a bit socially awkward, I just assumed it was due to my not being raised among other kids due to homeschooling, which I was subjected to until my parents' divorce in the 7th grade. But once I began highschool, everything seemed off to me. I started to experience periods of emotional numbness, and would sort of struggle to find motivation to succeed. As a result my grades took a hit. I had always been a high-80s to mid-90s student, but some course marks dipped as low as 70. I naturally blamed myself for not trying hard enough, and swore I would do better.
Since then every physical aspect of my life has improved. I have a job, I have new friends who I have been able to have fun with. I am doing well in school, and have my future plans set out before me.

But I feel like it's all worthless garbage. The only motivation to do anything at all I feel is the pain I would cause those I so selfishly let care about me. It is a strong motivator most of the time.
The numbness lasts longer, sometimes days, and I find myself losing grips on reality. I will lay on the floor for hours, thinking, but not thinking. It's more like a trance or something. I will lock eyes with my reflection and the same thing will happen. Even when I've been hanging out with my friends I've been sucked out of the moment, going quiet and small. Sometimes they say something to me about it, and I just shrug it off. Honestly it's gotten to the point where, in this state, I don't care what happens to me or anyone and that scares me. I feel normal for the most part sometimes, but other times everything is void. And I feel like it's made up until I experience it again. And I feel like questioning my insanity is worse than questioning my sanity. I don't know what, if anything, is wrong with me and it really sucks, big time.

I don't really feel like continuing to write, it's late and this was draining. I have hope things will get better, but honestly I've come to terms with the idea of living the rest of my life this way. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",31May2019,4
22,"I work a full-time job, with benefits. Financially, I'm not rich, but I'm not poor. My insurance supposedly covers mental health services, but I recently made the call for a referral, and I was only given a list of 3 providers. None of them are accepting new patients, and even if they were, I can't find enough info on them online to even know if they will be a good fit for me. 

There are a few providers in town that I think I would feel really comfortable with, but they are not covered under my insurance and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I make enough that I don't qualify for sliding scale, but not enough to actually pay the full rates. 

This is ridiculous to me that, at this point in my life, I am more financially stable than I ever have been and quite frankly, pretty privileged in terms of money. Yet, I cannot get decent mental health care. 

Honestly, it scares me and it makes me feel a bit hopeless. I've been going back and forth with even wanting help, and it took a lot for me to finally decide to make that phone call. I'm super disappointed that I am not finding anything that can help me.",31May2019,310

25,"I'll keep it succinct.

I have gone through a lot of positive life changes in the past 6 months. I have lost almost 40 pounds and I'm in phenomenal shape. I was never grossly obese, just 'hefty,' but it is crazy how much better I look and feel. It is so powerful that I almost want to cry thinking about it (in a positive way). I'm a 23 year old dude with a good office job, just for some background.

I've come to realize I'm a really talented runner. I think I can get to the Boston Marathon. Of course, this will take a while to get to. I have been training religiously, eating really clean, and feeling like a champ. This has paid dividends throughout every part of my life.

I have two races coming up within a couple weeks, and I felt like I was going to absolutely crush it.

And then, after being undisciplined and overtraining, I have a knee injury now. I don't think it's anything severe at all, and it should be fine within a week or two.

But I feel completely demoralized and sad. I want to lay down and cry. I can't do what I love. I'm really worried I'm going to fail. I've completely let myself go the last few days, and have literally been in bed with Ben &amp; Jerry's. I don't even feel good at all doing that, but it's just scratching the self-loathing itch.

It all feels so damn unfortunate and I'm really down on myself. How do I pick myself up out of this funk, right **NOW**, before letting it become a negative slide? I really need some advice right now.",31May2019,5
26,"So I'm a straight man. I know this for a fact due to me always having been attracted to women and women alone for most of my young adult life. During my early twenties, I experienced a mania episode of bipolar and one of the symptoms was hypersexuality.

At first, I simply went out and had sex with women. It was sometimes up to three times a week. Beforehand I had never engaged in any type of sexual promiscuous behaviour like this and I never had a desire to. My tastes kept changing. Eventually vanilla sex stopped cutting it and I sought more and more thrills. I started watching more extreme porn and on some occasions, even had sex twice a day. I was on hookup sites, dating sites, you name it. Eventually, I came across crossdressers and transgenders and I started having sex even with them too and once with a man. 

After my episode ended, I convinced myself that I must be bisexual and just didn't realise it. Eventually I realised that it was just my desire for sex at the time. I wasn't attracted to men or transgenders. I just desired sex and new experiences whoever they may have come from. I even used prostitutes on occasions. That's how obsessed with sex I had become.  No longer could I look at gay or transgender porn either. In my ""normal"" state, I feel either nothing but indifference or disgust if I come across such porn or think back to those experiences. And remembering even some of the women I had slept with, I think how could I have done it with them? They were not the women I am normally attracted to. 

This is where my OCD came into play. I have intrusive thoughts and the half of the thoughts that keep coming into my head now are that I must be bisexual because of all the sex I was having in the past. Other intrusive thoughts I have are sexually explicit ones that I have sometimes when talking to somebody and the thoughts are about them even though I don't have any desire to do any of those things and find these thoughts disgusting. 

I have this OCD of even just having to look at porn to denounce it and I believe this came because of my past excessive viewership of porn during my episode and it's just ridiculous. I know that but no matter how much I use reason in my mind, the OCD thoughts about my sexuality will return, so does the ritual of having to look at porn even when I'm not interested in it and the intrusive sexual thoughts I will have of somebody while talking to them.

Has anyone else been through this type of experience? And how have you dealt with intrusive OCD thoughts and behaviours?",31May2019,0

When I went to secondary school I had to have 3/4 years off for hospital and operation and recovery, being in ITU for three weeks being awake and unable to take.

32,"This is more to vent than anything. Not native English speaker, be nice. Also I think you are supposed to apologize for writing on your phone, so, sorry.

Tldr at the bottom 

Well, first, some context.
I was born and raised at a small town in rural Brazil. I studied most my life with this girl, V. She is outgoing and friends with everyone, and pretty much my only friend. She was also a not very good student. At tests, she would sit behind me, and I let her copy my answers. I was just happy to have a friend.  I was a little nerd girl, whose idea of fun was reading. Thinking back, that was probably the start of my anxiety thingy. It was easier to deal with stories than people, and I would be praised for reading so much, so why bother? 

And being called the teachers' pet was the smallest of my troubles. Because my mom used to teach Biology at a college, she would sometimes fight with my biology teacher for the various stupid mistakes she would make while teaching us, things my mom would notice while helping me with homework and tell me to inform the teacher that this and that information was wrong/dated. And because the school was so very small (I'm talking one class per year, 12 - 25 students max.), the teachers were all very close to each other, and I ended up being marked by several of them for daring to correct a teacher. Also during one of the history classes I realised Catholicism didn't make sense to me, thus further separating me from my religious orientated city.

I didn't really have friends to spend my summer break with, so my parents would send me to summer camps. I loved those, but they were filled with temporary friends that I never did manage to keep in touch with. So when school came back, I was alone again. 

When I was nearly 15, and going to Brazil's High School equivalent, my parents took me to  this scholarship test in a brand new school at a city three hours away. That school didn't have Primary School, so everyone would be starting from zero in terms of friend making. I started living alone at a nearby apartment complex across the street, and I loved it. I finally had a few friends, and I adored my new teachers. All during this, I more or less lost touch with my friend V. I learned later that she got expelled, and at her new school her friends were into drugs: cigarettes, pot, mushrooms, lança-perfume, acid, MD and more that I don't know the name.

Anyway, I managed to get accepted into a very nice public Law university. But at a different city. A different state even. And I didn't, don't fit in here. I didn't manage to make friends, my teachers show up for class if they want, the place is underfunded too, and they are currently trying to cut even more of the costs. I've had classmates dropping the course because they were being forced to choose if they wanted to eat that week or have the materials for the next class. Just Google the scandals of the politics from Rio de Janeiro,  you'll see what we're dealing with. 

I struggled to fit in, in any way I could. I thought about giving up and trying for a new college, the one most of my High Schools friends were, and which was at the city I was living at before as well. But I didn't want to face that, to admit failure. During this, I learned V got into a Law School as well. It was an expensive private one, and we got to compare them.

I struggled quite a bit during this time. I simply had no will to go to the classes, not even to read or watch series or eat or anything. Then I got mad at myself for having wasted all day doing nothing. I was miserable. The only group I was a member of was one that simulated UN conferences, and one that required the participants to take on pretend roles of diplomatic, so I wasn't even myself during those. 
Also, I talked more regularly with V. She told me a bit of her friends, some of whom were drug dealers, and her classes, which she liked to go to while high. One day she called me in despair, because someone had drugged her joint with what we later figured out was some rape drug. In short, everything n her life was related to drugs.

Well, comes the Holidays, and she decides we could go on a trip to Central America. I said sure, could be fun, right? Well, she also decides to smoke pot the whole time. Now, I liked pot. But only a way to turn things better, not as the fun thing to do. She didn't agree. She would smoke herself to a coma, and we got into some pretty dangerous situations because of her recklessness. During all this, we were staying at hostels, with plenty of supply.  I put my foot down when she mentioned a few other things that they were offering. During this trip she told me of little details I didn't know. About her drug dealer, and his boss, who both liked to come around her place. About the time she tried to kill herself, because she mixed her meds with pot. About all her meds, some of which really should NOT be mixed with other drugs. Drugs like what we had been using. You know, details.  

With less than a week to spend, we got the news that a certain police operation got most if not every supplier of her university, including close friends of hers. The next morning, we got a message that one of her friends died as well. He was abusing drugs for a few years, and his kidney failed. And his heart, and a few major veins and arteries,  and lastly  his pulmonary system. She was wrecked. I was too. I had just gotten hit by the realization that this girl had friends ending up in jail because of drugs, had just lost a close friend because of drugs, and her response was to use more of them. I returned home exhausted, much more than I was before the trip, and an emotional wreck. 

Now back at Rio, I found a psychologist and a psychiatrist, and have started to getting myself back together. But I can't keep talking to her like normal. I had a serious talk with her but I don't think she gets it. She just don't understand why I want to distance myself. But I know she won't stop doing drugs, and I know that I can't force her to stop it either. But I'm going crazy with worry, and it's too draining to worry about her on top of everything else right now. 

I just don't know what to do. Right now I have been answering when she talks to me, but have avoided sending messages myself. I don't know if it's the right thing to do, or whatever else I should be doing. 
Is it wrong of me to not talk to her? What can I do in this situation? Has anyone gone through something similar?

35,"Trying to figure some stuff out. 

For context, I am in therapy but am also dealing with serious real life shit (my mom has brain and lung cancer, the lung is stage 3), I’m 26, living home to help w my mom and just really struggling.

I had a suicide attempt almost a year ago, the hospital somehow released me the very next morning after they asked if I still wanted to kill myself and I said no. I’m having a really hard time lately. My thoughts are all consumed with wanting to hurt myself and or end my life.

I also have an eating disorder, I barely eat and barely sleep right now. I am able to hold down my full time job, and socialize and just put on a “normal face.” No one understands how badly I’m struggling, and I obviously don’t want to overshadow my mom.

I’m getting increasingly worried I won’t be able to continue to ignore my thoughts of doing some serious self harm, or attempting again. My therapist typically just wants to talk to me about my mom, like 35 mins of a session are dedicated to that. She has gotten in depth about my attempt in the past, but since then hasn’t brought it up. I have a really hard time bringing anything up without being prompted. My eating disorder is also driving me up a wall lately, and even though she specializes in that, we never touch on that either. It just makes me feel like I’m not sick enough.

I don’t really know why I’m posting or what I’m doing. I guess my question is, do I keep trying and going day by day and hope things get better? Are thoughts, but not actions (yet) about serious self harm or another attempt enough to go to a hospital for? I just find that hard to believe because they didn’t even keep me after my last attempt. Do I try and open this dialogue with my therapist? I don’t see her until next week (Friday) I just had her today and I didn’t mention any of this and a week just seems long. I just am at a loss.

37,"I would say my worst trait is that I am a jealous person. I never act on this, like I don't cause people problems to stop their success but the feeling of inadequacy eats away at me. I feel paralized by it, I am so angry that I am not the person and don't have what they have that I begin to hate the person, and hate myself. Then instead of this becoming a motivation for me to want to achieve it, it instead turns into self-destructive behavior. Here's an example: 

I live with an extremely fit and healthy person. He works out 3 hours a day, measures every signle thing he eats, is calculated about eating right and never eats junk food, he gets 10 hours of sleep a day as well. He spends hours with his friends after work, has a girlfriend whom he spends a healthy amount of time with sometimes not even coming home to stay at her place. He goes on trips, roadtrips, to parties. He has his own car, he works part time as a teacher, and is finishing up an engineering degree. He still compains about his life, and that just makes me more angry at him. 

I see this person every single day living with him. My life is the total opposite. I eat a lot of junk food because that's my escape. I sleep 4 hours a night, not because I'm working, but because I can't sleep. I'm sluggish all day, I'm obese, I have anemia so I'm tired on top of all that evne with medication, I spend 80% of my day lying on my bed with my lap top on my belly watching tv shows. Sometimes the ones I've seen 2-3 times before, avoiding thinking about things. I have 0 friends. I'm still a virgin, and it doesn't look like that will change any time soon. I don't drive (have a license, but don't drive because everyone kept telling me I was a bad driver when I was practicing to get my license). I don't work. I don't exercise. I barely leave the house, because being outside is terrifying to me. I'm going crazy because I hate every single thing about how I'm living my life... and it's reinforced on the daily because my roommate is living the life I want to be living. 

Except, you would think that being around him would make me want to change. Nope. I am so jealous, so angry, so honestly discouraged that I do the opposite. I don't know why, I don't know what I'm trying to prove, but I do the exact opposite of what I need to do! I eat more junk food when I'm mad and compare myself to him, because I'll never be fit and I've been trying to lose weight for years and people make fun of me for trying ""yet again"" (him included) and I'm just sick of it. The one good thing in my life is food, so I'm gonna have even mroe of it. He goes out with his friends?

I've begun to question reality because I thought a shirt pocket on one of my pyjamas ised to be on the other side (though I can't remember anymore if it was or wasn't on that side originally), and I don't feel like I can really trust my friends or psychiatrist (despite having been pretty open with them before). I think all my friends are just tolerating me right now and are ready to abandon me the second they know they can't see me again, and because of that fear, I'm considering staying shut away from them under the guise that my phone doesn't work so that I don't have to face what I consider to be ""the truth"". I thought a man on the bus today was talking on the phone about me, and tried to listen into the conversation for a while to see if he does (I thought he might be a government agent).

I also very likely have narcissistic, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.

But one of the things she has told me is a list of pop culture things that give her panic attacks due to a strong negative association with the person from her past
We were watching a movie and she forgot that one of the items on that list was a character in the movie, and she started getting really upset and all.  She started apologizing for being like that, and going on about how I didn’t sign up for this and that I deserve a better first girlfriend than her (this is my first relationship).

50,"Okay so, I’m 22, female and live in Switzerland. I’ve been struggling with severe agoraphobia and avoidant personality disorder for the past six years of my life when I suddenly decided to quit my internship and totally isolate myself from the rest of the world. Of course I had my reasons, like dealing with long term psychological trauma that resurfaced from childhood experiences after working with other children (I worked in a daycare facility).  

Since then I’ve been in therapy with an older but experienced psychiatrist who helped me understand myself better. For the longest of time, cognitive therapy helped me deal with the trauma, but the depression never truly went away. That’s why we tried medication. And we tried a lot of it. I’ve been on every well known antidepressants but every single one of them had an unpleasant side effect I could not deal with. Until finally we tried Wellbutrin and it helped me very much with my concentration issues and overall depressed mood. That’s also when I was suddenly diagnosed with bipolar disorder because the Wellbutrin essentially made me into a moody person who switched from very depressive to very energetic. So I stopped the meds (gradually), which led me to where I am now. Since then I also broke off the therapy because I had some issues with the therapist I could only identify when I was antidepressants free, like for example she was using certain phrases my father did too, and then found out that she was relying to me my father’s wishes through therapy instead of letting me guide where the issues where. She admitted that by the way, when I confronted her, I’m not making it up. 

I’ve been slowly isolating myself from everyone. I’ve broken ties with family members and only leave the room at night when everyone’s asleep. I’ve successfully avoided my brother (who desperately wants to see me and doesn’t live at home) for the last three months, and my cousin who once was a dear friend of mine. 

I feel like I’m saying goodbye to everyone. All I think about is suicide and I don’t cry anymore at the thought of dying, on contrary, I feel euphoric. Shortly before my menstrual periods I’m at my lowest and always very close to ending it. I’m afraid of hospitals because of past negative experiences and I can’t say anything to my parents because my father is very good at manipulating the situations in his favor and my mother has suffered psychotic breakdowns because of my past suicide attempt and overall bad decisions. I don’t know what to do, in general because every time I try to think about a solution my brain automatically shuts it down. Basically, suicide is the only solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Think about suicide all the time but alcohol really gets me over that hump and just going for death. Pretty sure I've done a lot of damage to my body after these recent attempts and taking all of the prescribed meds that have accumulated since last year.

Havent really worked since last July, with a small 3 week stint in March and I've just really become a hermit. I question my mind and am scared of the public,my family ,how much I can't get a job, the pressures put upon me to give so much to family that obviously don't care about my feelings etc etc.

Just a fucking loser at life and as much as I hate him, I have become my father but instead of getting breaks and love left and right by his family, I get treated like garbage from those same people or how my moms family sees I have a problem with alcohol but will gladly let my mother keep living in the same house as me while basically holding her beer under my face.

Yesterday my Mom came to me and just asked if I was breathing(Laying in bed) and left.(So Feeling The Fucking Love!!) Went for a smoke 20 min ago and she said that she was getting tired of it, as in annoyed by it.

Feel like this weight of absolute bullshit is suffocating me. I think I just might be autistic or something past my adhd ""diagnosis"" but who fucking cares.

Anyways so my mom mentioned this last year but reminded me just now about how if I get committed again, the State of Wi can keep me away for a year or something like that and I honestly would probably fucking love it!!

People leave me the fuck alone and maybe I'll end up at another place that doesn't monitor your food intake. Had one where I didn't eat or drink for 2 days straight.

I'm not lying to myself and say that's how it is going to be and I'm sure it would be pretty serious but I think for myself and my mind it would be better to get away from public living or whatever for awhile.

54,"I've only recently admitted to myself that my mom might be abusive towards me. When I was little, she would beat me (a lot of parents use physical punishment, which fucked up). Nowadays it's mostly emotional and mental abuse.

She's very undermining and nitpicky and flat-out mean sometimes. For instance, she just said something along the lines ""Be sure to pick up the phone so I can remind you to do X thing because you're too stupid to remember on your own"". She's controlling and I feel like I have a responsibility to always please her.

In my senior year of HS I didn't want to invite her to the graduation ceremony (because not a lot of my friends' parents could make it and being a teenager, I was like, you know, ""if my friends' parents aren't coming, I don't wanna be the only one being embarassed by my mother). 

She found out the date and time without me telling her and came anyway. Afterwards, she made such a big tragedy out of it and cried for days and made me feel like the shittiest person in the world. I admit, I was being stupid, but she didn't have to act like that. 

She's extremely immature sometimes (even though she blames me for being immature). I never got to go through a rebellious phase as a tenager because I always always worried not to step on her toe and now I can see the unhealthy side effects of the lack of self-expression.

The worst part is that she can also be very loving and fun. It's like she has split personalities. It leaves me confused. One minute she's talking to me in this really sweet voice about whatnot, the next minute she's changing to this daunting tone and starts critising me for things I do wrong and I've done wrong in the past.

I'm torn beause she's like this. It would be easier for me if she was a c*nt all the time, but no... I hope you understand my issue.

58,"It happened after an argument with my girlfriend.

I'm not going into detail about the argument, but afterwards, I got pissed off and tried to unwind by playing Farcry 3. When I finished, at about 4am, I got up to go to the bathroom.

At this point, I grabbed my door handle, but I hesitated. My mind started racing. Here are what my thoughts were:

""These four walls of my bedroom are my existence. I have died and this is my purgatory. I can't leave, because this is literally my universe now. 

Where can I go to the bathroom? Eat? Drink? Bathe? Fuck, what have I done, how did I get here, where am I""

It's kinda grey from there on, until I calmed down a bit. I worked up the courage to open my door, to see what I should have expected. The corridor. The bathroom at the end of the corridor seemed further away than usual, but to me, it seemed like it was getting further and further away from me. I just stood there.

My rationality kicked in, and I approached it, knowing that I would eventually get there. Everything was coming back to normal. I was reconnecting with myself, and the door became it's original state. I came back to my senses.

I heard this idea in [Jocko Willink](https://www.facebook.com/Jocko-Willink-818075548306978/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARArGejfkFptwJ8gP2efzUecN2vJZVjIizQhxiK2Rg_MxRXciUXHi1qXU7ksU5tqMO3JmtaFZnhwOdgw5no9v0xnFlyx9qshErytB896n24RF9oj7OGDuQXhv6UBItHy0frGGOMTNV1cyMGW6uU7OGtdf6oKFCb82bhSnqgGwILhan-Z-g18Mf-PdZfIEWcEONKRIZZM3a3W&amp;__xts__%5B1%5D=68.ARATV_Jk-mqVON2hoMAub71YJsRroqhZvm8wKPynORslBC1lrnR5B3meJbNP8nojcQ8NkplYzLz6nGqowkXStIWyPCPsOLncubqW2swOQBJCPsmtndsDPjkMcNhgPaqfpwZqEc-51rdiwDWeYfA4Sa0TO5DrGoQyMFkdl_wphFwAGYcuEDcqTqMDPJbz1v4qexFK-3vW9L1q&amp;__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAjufJArc5zKW7nEY8Ao2X9JH4flIEfru3luXLWWP8wR-c1FYb1PUyHoS7gJge5zfxmSte9eQk_lj1K&amp;fref=mentions)'s podcast and it got me thinking for a while. It sounds simple and maybe trivial but is very unfamiliar to the human mind. The statement insinuates that given the mind is “tough enough” to endure psychological pain, it is possible to fail your whole life at everything, then dust off, stand up for a millionth time and move forward yet to fail again. I like this idea.

Mental toughness for me is how much the mind agrees with the statement above. By “the mind” I mean the part of the brain that triggers instinctive survival mechanism. When active, it shuts down your rational thinking, desires, wants, needs. Now the body acts on its own to survive. There is no you there. This mechanism works well in life threatening situations, but also does a very good job at working passively, leading you away from any kind of discomfort, including the fear of failure.

In battle, an average soldier quits if something terrible happens. Might be a severe injury, failed operation or freezing after seeing death. A warrior quits when he dies. No limbs intact, no allies alive, no supplies left, fight is not over until the last breath is taken. Warrior’s mentality is the peak of mental toughness.

Why mental toughness? Life does not cooperate. At least, not for me. For some of us it might be substance abuse, depression, abusive household, failed exam, failed job interview, ego issues, eating disorder, getting bullied, losing yourself in pursuit of trying to fit in, being last at everything, loss of loved ones, hating the reflection in the mirror, etc. Without mental toughness, problems like these will break anyone. Some might say they have a perfect life and no problems at all. In that case, you are either extremely gifted and/or set your goals very low, if any. There is no problem now, but everything will surface, trust me. Life hits everyone in the guts at some point in time.

Is mental toughness inherent? Is someone just born weak? I do not know. All I know, the weakest, most broken person in the world can become unbroken and later, unbreakable. Not a fact, rather a belief. However, there is proof. Go read “𝐶𝑎𝑛’𝑡 𝐻𝑢𝑟𝑡 𝑀𝑒” by [David Goggins](https://www.facebook.com/iamdavidgoggins/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARArGejfkFptwJ8gP2efzUecN2vJZVjIizQhxiK2Rg_MxRXciUXHi1qXU7ksU5tqMO3JmtaFZnhwOdgw5no9v0xnFlyx9qshErytB896n24RF9oj7OGDuQXhv6UBItHy0frGGOMTNV1cyMGW6uU7OGtdf6oKFCb82bhSnqgGwILhan-Z-g18Mf-PdZfIEWcEONKRIZZM3a3W&amp;__xts__%5B1%5D=68.ARATV_Jk-mqVON2hoMAub71YJsRroqhZvm8wKPynORslBC1lrnR5B3meJbNP8nojcQ8NkplYzLz6nGqowkXStIWyPCPsOLncubqW2swOQBJCPsmtndsDPjkMcNhgPaqfpwZqEc-51rdiwDWeYfA4Sa0TO5DrGoQyMFkdl_wphFwAGYcuEDcqTqMDPJbz1v4qexFK-3vW9L1q&amp;__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARBSnF0TK-1M_gaC6eGpBHH2_y2XuEYdJVUefgBEVyEbS5lpYNcETj3FuJt7tk1rs53JQR8FqjRY3crM&amp;fref=mentions). It is a real story about finding yourself through struggle. I still go back to it every day. Still, some things in the book do not make sense to me. I literally cannot process it. It is expected, as I have not struggled enough.

How one becomes mentally strong? One solution is contradictory. “𝑃𝑢𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑙” as some call it. It means doing something uncomfortable every single day and little by little, victim’s mentality starts to break. Breaking yourself down through physical effort, having fear of speaking and then doing a public speech, taking cold showers all seasons, waking up before sunrise, staying true to yourself and the reflection in the mirror, leaving a toxic group of people who drinks a lot, surrounding yourself with people who are better than you and make you feel worthless, meditating, or in general, getting after every single insecurity, every single fear you have are all good examples. It can be as little as looking in the mirror, given you have self-image issues.

For me, physical effort works wonders. You break yourself down, train hard until your mind screams stop. Take moment to rationalise, reset the timer and then start the workout. It takes everything. It is a simulation of triggering safety mechanism in the brain and then flipping it off. All insecurities suddenly surface: “𝑊ℎ𝑦 𝐼 𝑎𝑚 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠? 𝐼 𝑎𝑚 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ, 𝐼 𝑎𝑚 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑔𝑢𝑦, 𝐼 𝑎𝑚 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑘.” The fight begins.

Self-discipline. Self is the key word here. Discipline by itself is nothing. I was disciplined at school, I had mentors and other people to force me through it. Yet I was broken. To fix yourself, everything must come from yourself, not your close friends, relatives or parents. Having someone motivate you is not going to work. Watching a motivational video or reading an inspiring book is also not going to work. It might give you the spark to light the fire, but motivation is temporary. It comes as quickly as it goes away. On the other hand, self-discipline implies long-term motivation. Some call it obsession.

“𝑂ℎ, 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑖𝑠 𝑠𝑜 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐼 𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑙 𝑠𝑜 ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑦, 𝑠𝑜 𝐼 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑟𝑢𝑛 𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦.” – said a motivated person.

“𝑂ℎ 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑧𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒, ℎ𝑜𝑤 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔. 𝐼 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑟𝑢𝑛 𝑛𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠.” – said an obsessed person.

A person who willingly makes his/her life challenging and hard can never be happy. This statement is false. In fact, happiness is amplified. Being happy means having a different perspective in life. From my own experience, once you struggle every single day, you learn to appreciate the little things. Having a 10 am breakfast after 4 hour long training session is heaven, compared to having breakfast just after getting up. Similarly, even going for a relaxing walk in the park has more satisfaction if you earned it before. More so, happiness comes from the sense of self-accomplishment and proving yourself wrong. It is not about competition, relatively comparing yourself to others, but about comparing today’s you to yesterday’s you and seeing the change no matter how small.

Surely, thinking only about yourself and your problems, insecurities is extremely egotistical. Yes, this is true. But there is a bigger picture here. One can never drive a necessary narrative of change in this world without being mentally ready. Same goes for helping others. Today’s world needs changes, no secret here. It might be too late to do anything, but taking this as an argument to do nothing is absolutely ignorant. Our world faces enormous issues. To collectively fix the world means starting from its smallest instances – ourselves.

I wrote all of this as a reflection of who I am not but aiming to be. No wonder, I had the best childhood ever. I literally had no real life problems. Every meal was ready, clothes cleaned and laid out, had a place in a private school, what a sweet life. I was given everything, but had nothing inside. Nothing to deal with struggles yet to come. No toolbox in the mind to deal with hardship. No sponge to suck the pain up. That is why I view struggle as mental training ground. Getting ready before the storm.

I thought he had already stopped harassing people but I recently found out that he did the same thing to his friend a couple of weeks ago. This could have been prevented if the justice system didn't suck. It'll probably take years for all of this to be resolved and honestly I am so sick and tired of waiting.

The medication I’m currently taking  sent me in to what I believe was a hypomanic episode, which when I mentioned was told to speak to my normal gp, who will no doubt tell me to speak to my mental health team about!

I’m so angry that I’ve not been taken seriously and my care is being compromised because of it.

I just spin it out in my head for sometimes like an hour, it usually is that I might have a mental illness, like onset schizophrenia or something (even if a large part of me knows I don’t) or that my family doesn’t think I care about them, things like that. Even if I KNOW it’s not reality, I more dread the thought at this point because I know the thought will debilitate me.

That really hurt me because I pictured myself with her so now it’s hard for me to restart my life I guess. Seeing her doing well makes me very happy for her because she deserves it but it’s hard for me to see her move on so easily and me sitting here literally not sure what to do with myself. I don’t know if this is me actually having a emotional problem because my older brother does have bipolar disorder and I’ve always worried that I have something along those lines.

68,"So today I was reading the news and I saw that last year about 3400 car accidents, then I did a quick research and found that more than 10 000 people died from suicide, and that there are at least 100 000 suicide attempts every year in my country. What really annoyed me is that there is so much prevention for road safety, like you can see ads on TV, you have to get your license, everyone tell you not to drink and drive, every year in middle and high school (or the equivalent here) policeman or firefighters come and talk to us bout road safety. But on the other hand NO ONE ever told us about mental health. Ok in middle school we had a speech against bullying but after that I still got bullied af and was still too ashamed to talk about it. And every year teachers say ""if u have personal problems come to us and tell us we'll be more lenient"" and that's all. Moreover things like suicide, depression, and all other mental health issues are quite taboo here, no one ever talk about it, and most people act like it don't exist, while 1 person out of five, or even more, will have a mental health related issue in their life. 

Sorry this is the part were I talk a bit about myself, but I guess it's to give an exemple. So I was bullied but I was too ashamed to talk about it because whenever someone would mock me in class the teacher would laugh too, or my bullies always made it look like it was my fault so I couldn't get help from teachers because they didn't believe me, so I ended up being suicidal. Thanks to that I have had anxiety so I recently just learned that it's not normal to have an anxiety attack whenever you have to leave home. It took me years to open up because I've always been told by most of the people it's nothing, you're ok. In the end I went to therapy, which I find really helpful as I'm getting better, while a few years ago I thought I'd be seen as crazy if I ever asked to see a therapist. And I realize that most people just ignore mental health and that there should be more awareness about it.

So sorry this was a bit long but I'm getting to my point finally. As the system is broken about this and the society ignores mental health I really want to help to raise awareness because otherwise not many people will do it. I don't really know what to do so I figured out I should try to spread a message on social networks, as it may reach many young people, which is good. So I created a throwaway account and contacted someone with quite a lot of followers (more than 400k), and he kindly accepted to retweet my tweet. So now I have to write  thread to raise awareness about mental health issues. I already have a ideas of what to say about it, for exemple that it's more common that we think, also that there is no shame to have any problem, and that its OK to reach someone for help (I'll like the suicide hotline), and that it's not ok to have issues.

 But idk I'm not a writer and I feel like I missed many things to say, so if you have any idea of what I should say too that'd be great. Also if you know any other way about how I can spread this message, I was thinking to do a short (10 minutes) video about it but I'll see.

70,"As I write this I am experiencing this. I just got home from work, it was one of the strangest shifts I've had at this place so far, not due to the circumstances, but rather what is happening to my mental functions. Before I continue it is worth mentioning that I am somewhat heavily addicted to Nicotine, I have JUUL device (I know lol). I don't bring my JUUL to work, so I am without nicotine without 5-6 hrs, if this happened to me everynight that I would chalk it up to nicotine withdrawal, but I've never had this problem before and I am on a very low nicotine dosage compared to how I was when I started my job (4 months ago)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my current symptom as I can best describe them:

\-Some normal things that I am used to seeing/doing nearly every day seem foreign and strange. 

\-Distorted sense of time, 5 minutes felt closer to 20-30. This is hard to describe.

\-Intense mental fog, I absoultely could not focus on any task. I was intensly in my own mind to the point where it felt like I wasn't in control of my body. It was almost like watching footage but I knew it was me, and I still had all my senses with me. This is also hard to describe.

\-Dream-like state. I have had immensely vivid dreams in my past, to the point where I wake up disorientated and it takes me a minute to release that everything was a dream. Tonight felt like/still feels like (somewhat) one of those vivid dreams. I questioned to myself multiple time if this was a dream, I knew that everything was real but my mental state was so strange that I found myself wondering. 

\-I felt ""high"", I mean this in a good and bad way. If I wasn't working while it happened to me I would probably be a mix of stoked and concerned. I mean this as a THC high, I am not by any means a heavy weed smoker but I am experienced enough to draw the connection to how I felt to be high. Just a detached sense of self.

\-Spotty memory, I don't remember most of what I did. I only know that I somehow completed all my work responsibilities, drove home (short drive), and arrived home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want this post to be any longer so I'm gonna cut it here, if anyone has some insight on what this is please let me know. I have experienced this before, but it was always very mild. This is something that I have struggled with for a little while and it would be great to get some answers. Thanks, sorry if this post makes no sense",31May2019,1
72,"Basically. Long story short. I have a disability called Dyspraxia which affects my social skills. 

Basically my social life is nonexistent now. I had a great social life in school with my friends but we barely speak anymore. I got bullied in school. In my first year in college, I got socially isolated by my class. Sometimes people pretended I wasn’t there, I was constantly arguing with people. My lecturers forced me on a gap year. 

I’ve been applying for jobs but I keep getting unsuccessful 24/7. I am also a drama student and every audition I have done hasn’t went well. I’m trying to brush it off but I can’t anymore. 

So I joined a musical theatre class to gain confidence and friends but things are going wrong. Basically I’m a boy and I keep hearing boys in my class talking about hanging out outside in class like ‘remember when we saw that movie on Saturday’ or ‘that party was cool!’ and stuff. I only joined like last year and basically boys who joined after me are getting invited to parties in the class but I’m not... and it’s so annoying as I’ve been here longer but people don’t think of me to hang out with. 

I felt so stupid yesterday as well as a guy in my class was joking about how old he looks and I messaged him with a positive message but he said he was only joking and sent a laughing emoji. 

Yesterday night I couldn’t stop crying and I felt so low this morning like I couldn’t feel any emotions or thoughts. I was just empty and woke up with no energy. 

I literally have no social life now. I start back in college in August. I’m 19 and I feel like a stay at home dad who is doing chores constantly and never has a social life.  The only social life I have is my internet friends on twitter. Who are the only ones who actually care about me. I care about many people but I get nothing back.

Google is being a massive B\*\*\* about getting help about this so I presume at least someone might know what's up. 

I'm currently in an LDR and have a deep connection with this person. I'm a pretty damn tough nut when it comes to stuff and am mentally strong and confident. However, my partner is less so. The partner has decided to commit, just like I did, but there will be long separation of a couple months before we see each other again (after that, much more often so that will be good). The person at hand is a little less confident and can get some irrational anxiety attacks which I was able to help with but I want to help this person become confident and less scared of the unknown while I'm not around. I do love my partner to bits, but have no clue how to go about the process being not invasive and for it to stick.

76,"To those who are contemplating suicide as a solution to their struggles:
On March 28th I committed suicide. I say ""commited suicide"" vs. ""attempted suicide"" because I didn't attempt anything. I made the active decision to end my life and followed through with it. 
Personally I am bi-polar with borderline personality disorder and PTSD. To say that I have struggled throughout my life is an understatement. Before this I have no history of physical self-harm. I quantify my reference to self-harm as ""physical"" because a lot of my behaviors and actions in other areas could be viewed as a different form of self-harm.
That day I was at work and had a terrible headache. I decided to go home for the day and tend to it. I have a history of missing work due to my instability and have even lost jobs over it. My very patient and loving husband was understandably frustrated with my leaving early again. We got into a bit of a spat and in a split second random decision I was going to kill myself. I enacted a plan, partially researched and partially from years of working in the pharmaceutical industry. I put together a cocktail of medications that would suppress my respiratory system until I finally stopped breathing. Before taking this medications I took phenergan to make sure that i didn't throw up my cocktail. 
Through text messages, calls, and facetime my husband realized that something was wrong. When he got home to me I was already aspirating and violently coughing. I had taken the medications 2 hours prior. He immediately called 911 and was told to secure the animals so that EMS could quickly get to me. He heard the sirens outside but due to our apartment complex being very confusing he knew that they were struggling to find us. In what I'm sure was the most terrifying decision of his life he left me in bed and ran downstairs to lead the paramedics to our apartment. 
By the time I made it to the hospital, all of the medications has been processed in my body and there was no point in trying to pump my stomach. I was in the ICU for 3 days, intubated and on the verge of death. 
Luckily I pulled through and made a full recovery. Had my husband been 5 or 10 minutes later getting home, I wouldn't be writing this post. I immediately went from the hospital to a treatment facility in Tennessee called the Ranch. I was there for 4 weeks and it was an incredibly life-changing experience. I highly recommend it to anyone with mental health or addiction issues. The Ranch is widely considered to be one of the best treatment centers in the country.
My point in sharing all of this is that I have seen first hand the effects that suicide has on your family and friends. It is a terrible decision that is selfish and uncaring. I will never forget the state that my family was in when I regained consciousness. It was devastating. 
To anyone who is considering suicide, please find another option. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and it is not worth it.",31May2019,7

78,"Hey Reddit, sorry for the long post.

I never used to have social anxiety or depression. I actually never really understood how people even could have those problems. 

I am in college and had a lot of fun for the first two years. In my first year my friends and I started smoking weed, just once or week or so when we’re just chilling or watching a movie or something. But as the semesters went on I realized I had to study a lot to pass the tests.

In my country (Netherlands) there are different tiers of high school and college. The “lower” the tier the more practical stuff you get. Like welding or electrics. You go to the tier that works with your academic abilities. During high school I did the second highest tier; which is all theoretical. It’s kinda weird but needed for the story.

I never had to study in high school. I could just follow the classes and get a 7/10 on tests which was good enough. My point is I never had to study. I never learned the will power to sit down and stay focused on studying for an hour or two.
So when I began to fail classes in college I started to get seriously depressed. I can’t stop college. I don’t want to disappoint my parents, but I also can’t seem to pass. So I started smoking 2 grams of weed everyday to numb my emotions and be okay with not studying today. “I’ll do it tomorrow” I always said. 

I can’t study when I’m stoned. So naturally I failed everything. I also started gaining weight, and now I’m at the point that I don’t fit most of my clothes and the shirts I do fit, show my fat belly and man boobs. So I always wear a hat and a jacket no matter how hot the weather. I started to lock myself in my room. I resent having to go outside to get groceries and stuff. When I hear random people laugh in public, I always think they’re laughing at me. I noticed today that I can’t even look strangers in the eye anymore. Thinking about it, I haven’t looked any stranger in the eyes for months. I always look at something else.

The only comfort I feel is from weed or shitty junk food. I know I’m destroying my life. My saving are completely gone and my throat hurts all the time from all my smoking. I feel like I’m stuck. And I’m deeply ashamed of what I have become. I’m afraid to tell my friends or family. Even though my parents are the nicest people ever. My siblings both have advanced degrees and I can’t even get through college. I can’t tell them about what’s going on. I’d rather lie than admit that their kid is a fucking loser addict.
My best friends are like brothers to me, but their both muscular and very comfortable in public. They pick up girls all the time and they’re doing great at college. How can I confide in them? Their life’s are awesome and I don’t think they’d understand. Besides I don’t want to admit to them that I’m actually pathetic.

I have thought about killing myself. I can’t kill myself outright because my parents will be devastated. Especially if they think they could have done something. I don’t want that they’re tormented with that thought all their lives. I thought about maybe stage an accident at a train crossing or provoke a group of aggressive drunk people going out. But I don’t want to hurt the people around me. A friend from college lost his friend when she got hit by a train when the crossing lights failed. It really messed him up and I don’t want to hurt the people around me like that.

I’m just stuck in a spiral. I can’t stop smoking, cause it stops me from feeling even shittier but if I keep going I’ll never break out. I am totally ashamed of what I am and can’t talk to my friends or family about it. I can’t kill myself and I don’t want to keep going. Therapy is expensive so I’d have to ask my parents to fund it, which would mean I’d have to explain whats going on.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. Did anyone go through something similar and have some advice?",31May2019,1
79,"I'm so angry. And I just have one group of friends and one of them is my problem so I can't talk to them probably.  
I don't even know how to start.   
I have/had a good friend. We saw each other every two weeks(My Anxiety loves this stuff). And suddenly it gets less and less. When my Anxiety got really bad this year I said somethign like ""Not everyone can run around showing off their depression and being loved by everyone"" as an Answer to: ""Just ask some people to hang put""  and I'm still ashamed that I said it. I apologized and didn't get an answer. I wrote a letter and they said that I'm important to them, that they would miss me if I would be gone and that they care. At this point we didn't see each other for five month. My Anxiety was going crazy when we met and it just felt like something changed. They are not writing at all, I always have to start the conversation. They never have time when I aksed. They said something mean when we met on the street and I needed to adress it later, because ""I'm not good at apologizing"" and then I got a Sorry. Which I alread feel bad about because I'm the one who said something mean first and then I'm making such a big deal out of this.  
A friend told me that I should just talk to them. So I said that I have the feeling something changed and that I really miss them and they told me that we should hang out again, not talking to me at all after this again. So why did I even adressed my feelings? When they are totally unimportant...  
Five week ago I wrote them ""You knwo it's easier when you just tell me when you got time and then we can meet"" and they said fine, we will do it that way.  
Nothing happend.  
Except the invitation of a friend to meet and an instand ""I'm there"" from said friend. While I'm here, waiting. Not even getting a message of five minutes of time.  
And still I don't feel like my anger is valid.

80,"Basically my illness consists of me having the obsessive thought that I'm saying all my thoughts out loud (not through telepathy - literally saying them out loud through my mouth). In addition to that, I have VERY intrusive thoughts. I would say this was OCD, if it weren't for the fact that I'm also hearing voices, in the form of replies to my thoughts, from the people around me. What's interesting is that I only hear voices when I have an intrusive thought. They're not constant. Basically when I'm alone in my apartment everything is good. 

Also, I always feel stuck in this limbo of not know for SURE whether I'm saying my thoughts out loud or not. I'm basically somewhere in between on believing whether these are just delusions or they're real. 

I'm trying to figure out how I can manage my illness. Basically the only things that I've found to help are antihistemites (namely difenhydramine and promethazine) and zolpidem (Ambien). When I take those I get a temporary relief from my irrational thoughts and hearing voices. I've done some research and found that one of the things that these have in common is their action on the GABA receptors. 

As antipsychotics don't seem to help, I am theorising that my illness isn't due to a dopamine imbalance, but a GABA imbalance. I would use these substances to treat my illness, if it weren't for their short effect and rapid tolerance build up. Due to those, I cannot be under their effect at all times. 

My question is, if these help, will CBD be a more permanent solution to my illness? I don't use recreational drugs anymore, but back when I did, and I only used a small amount of cannabis per day, I got a lot better in my normal state, but would sometimes go psychotic when I was high. My theory is that the CBD in the cannabis provided long term relief, while the THC made my condition worse. Thus, I felt better than now when I wasn't high, but sometimes felt worse when I was.

These are all my theories, gathered from the research that I've done. What I'd like to know is whether CBD might help, or whether there is any other medication that might?

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Sunday and will of course talk to him about all this stuff, however I would like to know whether any of you had any input about this. Unfortunately the doctors that I've seen haven't been able to help much in the past 3 years, so I'm hoping that one of you will be able to connect the dots on all the information that I've given.

I'm currently living at my dad's house because I had many issues with my mom in the past, but he doesnt understand the fact that I have probably multiple mental illnesses and suffer from trauma.

84,"My family and I were recently talking about how they feel when they take their first few drinks of alcohol, and I started to be concerned that I’m broken somehow. They all describe feeling a bit of euphoria, or a calming sensation. It effects their mood. (None are addicts, just normal social drinking at special occassions.)



I’m sure if I were to drink enough, I’d get intoxicated. But other than that I feel nothing when I drink. I may enjoy the taste, but that is it. If I drink a few glasses of wine I may start to feel my reactions being dulled, or feel dizzy, and I know it’s time to stop. But my mood has never been effected. 



I have realized that when I take narcotic pain pills (after surgeries) I also do not feel any euphoria. I didn’t realized I should until I began to think about this. I feel a slight lessening of my pain and nothing else. If I take multiple doses I feel extremely sleepy and dizzy. But again, my mood is not effected.



How unusual is this? My husband suggested I might have anhedonia. 



I suffered physical and sexual abuse as a child and have struggled with depression for my entire life. I’ve been in therapy regularly from 2001 to 2015, and that has helped some with the depression. 



I still have to force myself to live life most of the time, instead of staying in bed all day. I do experience pleasure, and I feel generally happy. I look forward to some special events. But I don’t feel extreme pleasure. Just mild happiness. It is better than I’ve ever felt before, so it is enough. 



I’ve taken antidepressants, and they have never worked. All that has helped (to limited degrees) is cognitave behavioral therapy, exercising regularly and having a good diet. 



Is any of this within the realm of normalcy, or is there still an issue that I’m not seeing because relatively speaking things are better than they have ever been? 

I’m asking Reddit instead of a psychiatrist because I’m sick of going to doctors and being told there is nothing wrong with me.

What I want to know is if there is a reasonable concern that I could have some disorder. If you can see it from what I’ve posted, then so will a doctor. If so, yes, I will go to a doctor.

85,"Hi, I think I need some opinions about this topic, it's been a major concern for most of my life, every time I've tried to bring this topic (may have been 3-4 times before) I just get ridiculed, missunderstood or just got answers like ""whatever dude"" so I'm going to try to open myself on reddit, the thing is that I happen to have an over-average intelligence (to clarify I'm seriously concerned about this, I'm not here to brag about it nor to fulfill my ego, I already got those answers before, I suffer from incredibly low self-esteem due to it, and specially dealing with frustration and anxiety because of me not fitting in well, by intelligence I mean IQ, logic, common sense, cognitive capabilities or however you want to call it) so basically I find myself being the smartest person in the room MOST of the time, I may have personally met 2-3 people (not counting people I listen to or read through other types of media) in my entire life that I really admire for their intelligence (I absolutely do not think it's the only important trait in life but it's the trait that I want an opinion about in this post and the one I'm concerned about, I may be claryfing too much but I just want to make sure that I explain myself the best I can). I'm gonna write down two of the main problems I've found:

•I choose VERY carefully the words I use when speaking (automatically, I don't spend 5 minutes thinking before saying something) because I know they have a meaning so I use them specifically when they fit exactly what I want to mean, with not a single exception, If I said a word and you look up its meaning I meant 100% that exact thing, same with how I put together any sentence, I do not leave any room for mistake, however I have to over explain myself (very often) due to missunderstandings and I always got really frustrated over it (never got angry at the other person, just got generally frustrated) that's why over the time I developed into choosing my words this way but somehow it won't change the outcome. It's as if people assume I meant something without me meaning anything close to it at all (and I'm talking about situations where I knew for sure my facial expressions, tone and body language didn't give any reason to missunderstand what I meant).

•I like to try new stuff so I've been through a lot of hobbies, also I crave for new knowledge constantly so this lead me to know a bit about a lot of topics and a bit more about what I'm more interested at the moment or that's what I thought when I was in high school until I've slowly come to realize that when I thought that I knew a ""bit"" about a topic I really knew a LOT more than most of the people mainly interested in that and when I'm into some field I can barely personally share it with anyone and that led me to feel quite lonely in a lot of things (of course there's people that know WAY more then me in every single topic, I'm not saying I know all about everything, I'm just saying that when I think I just got a bit curious about a topic and browsed/researched about it for a week or two I already found myself just absorbing everything I read and being precise with the sources so that I know I'm reading/seeing the correct info, and always thought that this was average, still I don't know what to think about that without the fear of falling into any narcissistic thoughts).

•This one is going to be a bit vague and I'm not sure if I'm gonna explain myself well enough (english is not my main language) but the third problem is regarding thought processes of people. When I'm socializing and a problem/hard question shows up even if I'm not familiar with the topic or I've never been in a similar context I end up being the fastest getting the most efficient answer without even noticing how hard it gets for other people and I sometimes get a really anxious when they seem to be really slow processing some thoughts to finally come to an answer if they even get there.

Finally, every time I shared this I've been told to look for therapy, I know it would probably help a lot but I can't afford it in my country and I can live with this but It's still a big problem in my life so I hope I may find an answer to all of this some day if I keep seeking help through other means.

For those of you that are curious I've been tested and have an IQ of roughly 160 still nothing crazy but enough to initially make me doubt if that's an important factor regarding the problems I started noticing happening to me when I was young.

I really appreciate your patience if you read all of it, I'll happily reply any questions. Thanks!!

TL;DR: I don't know if I have a problem or if my surroundings are the problem but I've been trhough severe anxiety and depression due to what I think is an over-average IQ and I'm trying to find some opinions about it in reddit.",31May2019,0
86,"Hello Reddit! I want you to help me find what's wrong with me because it becomes unbearable. I've struggled with depression before. And to mention my dad is indecisive as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I've been having problem which really makes life hard to live. I don't know when it started (side note: I think it started after I got ""addicted"" to self-help and ""becoming successful"") but the last month it's been so severe that I'm getting headaches on daily basis, feel my chest tightening, binge eat, miss sleep et cetera.

&amp;#x200B;

So the problem is constant, extreme indecisiveness. I can't make decisions at all. When I finally make one, I second guess it. When I finally make a decisions to not second guess it, I second guess it. Also something unusual is that my subconcious creates scenarios where I have to take a decision (impactful or not) and if I decide to not act (because fuck you fucking subconcious!), it will pass...for a few minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

&amp;#x200B;

\*Should I clean the windows - yes/no. 

If ""yes"" -my mind- but you have more important things to do now. Don't clean it, it's not that important.

If ""no"" -my mind- ""Ah, so you're being lazy again, uh?""

&amp;#x200B;

\*Should I go make an appointment for a haircut:

Yes: You can do it some time later, it's not that bad, or you can cut your hair yourself.

No: Ha, pussy, again got afraid.

\*\*I did it BTW.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Should I take notes while studying:

Yes: But they're a waste of time, you already do well reading and trying to understand instead of trying to memorize.

No: Lazy fucker!

&amp;#x200B;

\*Should I be ""productive"" all the time:

Yes: You'll burn out so fast that you'll regret it.

No: Stop being so lazy, you won't achieve anything!

When I thought I was a perfectionist (IDK if I'm, IDK if I know anything about me) I started applying the principle of ""it's good enough"" to EVERYTHING (in my mind and sometimes IRL). I would fucking leave all the baseboards in the apartment piling up with dust cuz you know ""you're being perfectionistic, you already vaccumed.

&amp;#x200B;

When I learnt about essentialism and started applying it to everything (in my mind and sometimes IRL). I would not clean my teeth if they weren't smooth because you did the important, you cleaned your teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

There are infinite amount of examples that I don't want to write about.

But often when I step out of the house, I feel judged and I hate to be looked at. Like, can't people ignore me the way I ignore them? I hate making eye-contact with strangers.

91,"Hello everyone. First of all I have to apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes I might make. My first language is not English.
Today has not been a great day. For no apparent reason I started doubting the fact that my relationship with my older brother was normal.
I am a male 20 year old university student living alone at the time away from my hometown. I grew up with a single mom and my brother who is 3 years older than me. As you'd expect we had problems with each other. My brother was a very problematic kid, extremely proud with a massive ego that was very easy to hurt. We would often fight and those fights would end up in me cursing like crazy and him targeting me based on my insecurities and hurting me physically again and again. He would often humiliate me by torturing me until I started crying and screaming in front of my cousin and once in front of a friend from elementary school. Things would get worse in highschool. I was in the closet and didn't like typically boyish things like sports. He figured that out and as a result called me the f word quite often. He would also make fun of me for not having friends. One time I desperately tried to prove to him that I did in fact have friends to hang out with (I didn't) . When he asked I told him who they were and he threatened to call and ask them. Later when I was around 16 he would tell my I'd never get into university and that I had no talents or anything special about me. When I told my mom she would often normalize this behavior. I don't blame her that much. Singlings fight. My brother would tell her I cursed at him and she would focus on that indirectly allowing him to beat me every time I cursed. That was not her intention of course.
I won't tell you I was an angel. But my curse words meant nothing and to physically abuse my older more muscular brother was impossible.
I hated him which was a horrible feeling to have for someone. It made me feel guilty. I do love my brother now. He is more mature and our occasional arguments seem normal as well.
I now struggle with so many insecurities. I struggle with socializing even though I have gotten better at it and made a few amazing friends. I often think I'm worthless and attempt to fit in different groups or take up hobbies to feel like I have a personality. I feel like all these issues might have something to do with the relationship I had with him.
Today I cried multiple times while thinking about this among other things and for a few minutes I felt terrified that one day I might commit suicide. I don't want to. I don't plan to. But I'm scared I will and that is a very confusing feeling. I want to talk to my mother about this. I'm financially dependent on her at the moment and I know for a fact she will pay for therapy if I ask her. But I love her to death and if I talk to her about this she is going to feel extremely guilty which is not what I want. 
Basically what I wonder is, is that a normal relationship? Are there any signs of abuse? Should I feel guilty for blaming so many things that are wrong with me on him?",31May2019,0

97,"My entire life I've felt anxious and had horrible self worth, but I was able to manage it. That all changed when my dad died. A few months after, my mental health fell hard and fast. I was unable to function like a normal person. I hid in my bedroom. I stopped cooking, my favorite hobby.

There is a lyric from Hamilton that describes what I was going through perfectly: there are moments when you're in so deep, it feels easier to just swim down.

The world was dark. I didn't think I could get out of it. I hated myself.

I wanted to die.

I sought out therapy, which I still go to. I found a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with anxiety, depression, and OCD. I do behavioral-cognitive exercises and I take 100mg of Zoloft every day.

It took a while, but things got better. The world isn't as dark. I don't hate myself. I don't want to die anymore. The OCD is still there but it's WAY more manageable. I have even started cooking again!

There is no shame in needing help. There is no shame in needing antidepressants to function. There is no shame in taking care of your mental health.

102,"So, this was my first year in upper secondary school (or whatever, European school systems vary from country to country, and I never know which term to use). I'm a perfectionist who strives to overachieve in everything. Due to that, I had a really stressful and straining year. I had a burnout right at the end of my last exam week, earlier this week.

My summer vacation started officially today, unofficially on Wednesday. Regardless, I haven't had any time to relax. Every day, there's places I need to go and things I need to do. On top of that, my mom pressures me to immediately clean everything so I can ""vacay in peace"". But my burnout is still haunting me and preventing me from cleaning. I'd just like a few day of doing nothing, please.

The rest of the week is going to be busy, too. On top of that, my summer job starts on Monday. Don't get me wrong, I'm very excited for my first job ever and appreciative of getting the job. I just feel that my vacation got robbed away. After my job, I do have a month for relaxing but then I have to start my second year in upper secondary.

Everyone has been warning me that as the courses get more demanding, the second year will be extremely more difficult and stressful. I also want to get a weekend job to earn money while going to school. One of my goals is to have my 18th birthday party at my own apartment, my birthday being in next March. Then a busy summer and the next year in school I start to take my two years of finals.

I feel very lost at the moment. I've crying the whole day because I'm not sure, if I'll make it. There's just so much that'll be going on in the few following years. After that, I want to move abroad to study in a university.

Basically, my problem is that I have intensely unstable moods, usually either very irritable or very depressed.  I have self harmed in the not so distant past and have also been vaguely suicidal (thinking things like “it’d be so much easier if you just killed yourself” or “you know that no one would miss you, just do it”) though my actions have never gone that far. The kinda strange thing is that these I guess symptoms show up the most at night or when I’m isolated (in my room alone, left at home alone). I’m trying to work up the nerve to possibly see a therapist, but we’re generally not in a great spot to do that right now. I really just want to know what’s going on because it’s confusing and kind of scary. Any recommendations as to things I could do or what ever this could be would be appreciated.",31May2019,5

He usually talks to himself, which has been quite alright for a long time now. It used to be just murmurs and thinking about stuff but lately, he has been more aggressive in the way he talks. Yesterday he slammed a door while talking to himself out of nowhere. Today he screamed ""do it yourself"" and stumped his feet really hard on the floor. A common friend told us that he sometimes says ""I want to kill myself"" to himself. He asked if he was doing okay and suggested that he sees a professional. He just said ""I'm fine, it's normal""

I think something is going on with him lately. But I have only dealt with depression and anxiety and this sounds like neither. I don't have an answer to ""why do you think I should go see someone?"" since he isn't actually being aggressive towards anyone else and he isn't attempting suicide or anything.

108,"I suffered from depression and anxiety a lot in my life but it didn’t occur until hardcore until I had my first child. I did not know how to cope or deal with it then. I didn’t even know I was depressed until a years later. I put on a show for people because I felt I had to. It got worse. I had no emotion. I woke up feeling like why am I even here? I would cry for hours. I felt pointless. As years progressed and trying to cope and developed my own self therapy and telling husband my mental problems I was good. No longer depressed. I had my twins a few years later after self therapy. After having my twins I suffered from post partum depression. This time it was much less intense but still sucked. I knew I needed help but didn’t trust therapists. Finally took a chance and am 100% postpartum depression free and depression free. I can feel when I need a break though and I know my triggers which can lead to depression. 

I say this to all people who are getting help and treated and no longer have depression and or postpartum depression, it will get much better although it doesn’t seem or feel like it AND get very familiar with your triggers and what will lead you to depression again. Me being a mother with twins and a 7 year old with really no outside help, i really have no outlet. So it put me in a situation where I’m around my children constantly, no time for myself, and it was a repeat. And twins are a lot of work. My children are the best thing in my life but to be healthy you need time for yourself to be your own individual. I felt me being sad for know reason and just drained and I realized I was going down that same path again leading to depression. I realized that. I now make sure I take time for me, work out alone, go on drives for myself, spend time with just husband and get ME TIME. I was able to stop the cycle.

114,"This is kind of a long and convoluted story but I'll try to summarize it as best I can. Back in January of 2018 I started seeing a new therapist for my binge eating disorder. I moved to South Korea for my last semester of school in February, and we continued to have weekly online sessions. I also communicated with her by email and through an eating disorder recovery app. I was 22 years old at the time and my parents were paying for my treatment. In June of 2018, they showed up in South Korea with no forewarning, demanding to see me and demanding that I take a bunch of different medical tests in Seoul...keep in mind I only had 3 weeks left in South Korea at this point. I angrily refused to see them, see a doctor, and terminated my treatment with the therapist, as I felt uncomfortable using my parents money to undergo treatment. (I felt like they were using my dependence on them in order to guilt me into doing what they wanted.)

Fast forward to August of 2018--I'm considering inpatient treatment and talking with the therapist again about options. Then, I discover a notebook in my parent's house filled with--guess what--notes about ME. It turns out my parents were seeing this SAME THERAPIST to discuss me and my eating disorder. In horror, I looked at my mother's email and found an entire folder dedicated to communications between her and my therapist. They started in January of 2018 when I started to see this therapist and went all the way to the present. In them, they discussed me, my therapist revealed private information I had told her in sessions, forwarded emails to my parents that I had sent her, and it turns out, was the individual who told my parents to fly to South Korea and accost me. Not once did I give my therapist permission to do any of this.

Needless to say I was livid. I saved the emails, confronted my therapist about it, and filed a HIPAA complaint. Unfortunately the HIPAA complaint was refused which makes me frustrated. My therapist completely violated my confidentiality and I feel like there should be consequences, but I don't know what else to do. I have the emails saved on my computer as proof, but it seems HIPAA doesn't care.

You could call it moderate social anxiety which becomes severe if I'm put in front of a large crowd to perform. Alcohol helps - but is not a healthy coping mechanism - it goes without saying. And yes, I know, people drink at parties. Most people need a little alcoholic lubrication to lighten themselves up. But it just doesn't feel right to rely on it for some kind of illusory confidence/get drunk to the point where you don't care any more. And for what? For a night you can't remember and a stinking hangover the next day? I don't think it's worth it any more. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past I'd force myself to go to these things just to be ""social"" or to please other people - for example because it was their birthday and I felt I needed to ""show up for them"". But you know what? I couldn't be bothered with the crippling anxiety tonight. I did not want to feel that way, so why would I put myself in that god-awful position? It's just madness to do so when you don't have to. Tonight I respected myself more than that, for the first time in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know avoiding things can make the anxiety worse long-term, but I'm on the waiting list for cognitive behavioural therapy to help with this. I believe the therapist may encourage exposure therapy - but exposure only works if you take baby steps i.e. expose yourself to anxiety-inducing situations gradually. If I went diving into this party tonight just to ""push the comfort zone"", I'd no doubt end up feeling just as bad as ever. So there was literally no point. I feel good about this decision, and surprisingly don't feel guilt for bailing. The person was not a close friend so I suppose it's not too much of a big deal for her.",31May2019,1
125,"When I am between reality and sleep I hear music in my head. I don't hear real sound. I hear it in head. It is like when you try to remember some song. You don't hear real sound, but you hear it in head. I hear original music that is never made before. Than I wake up to record it. Then I try to sleep again. After 10 minutes I hear new composition again. Then I sing and record it on iPod, to use it in compositions. Then it repeats over and over again. I try to sleep, i hear music, i record it... As you can see from my user name I like to make music. This is a reason why I record it. Is it normal? or i have some mental illness? Sometimes I am tired because I don't sleep enough because I record those ideas 2 hours.",31May2019,1
126,"My sister had a gathering for her BDay with family and a few friends who I don't know.  One Lady was talking about how rough her week has been since her sisters were gone and she was the only one to visit their mom.  She says she's berated ""but mom is mentally ill so I expect it.""  I don't know what the mental illness is but WOW I was speechless!  The intonation in her voice was shocking. Of course she was going on about her problems including diabetes diagnosed when she was 30.

I'm truly sad about the misconceptions still surrounding mental illness.",31May2019,3
127,"So on top of every other ducking reason I wanna quit life, it all comes back to fucking money. I hate my stupid job at Dunkin’ Donuts and I hate every customer. They’re all assholes. I’ve started pouring coffee from the pot onto my hand when I’m angry at the way customers treat me. I would be homeless without this shitty job. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past. I went to college for music because it’s my fucking dream. But I can’t afford the equipment to make pro sounding music. Nobody wants to listen to GarageBand produced songs. I can’t make money from music if I don’t have the money to make quality music. I can’t make money at Dunkin’ Donuts because it doesn’t provide me with enough money to rise. Just enough to barely live at this terrible fucking level of almost getting by. I don’t gain profit. I hate customers. The worst part is never having time or energy to work on music bc dunkin fucking Donuts is taking all of my time and energy. I already have energy and motivation problems because of my depression. And omg I hate customers. They fill me with so much rage. Why should I be making them coffee when I’m dying inside? Why does their bacon egg and cheese sandwich come before my mental health? I wanna kill my self but I’d miss my boyfriend and I’m terrified of non existence. Donald trump makes me wanna kill myself.

128,"I didn't really know where else to post this but this seemed like the best place to do so.

I live in the UK, I'm a male and I'm 20 years old. I don't know if it's much different in the USA or elsewhere but here it's pretty common for landlords and their families to live in the pubs/bars they work in, there's pretty often house sized accommodation on the property in some manner or another.

Anyway to get to the point, I was a child that grew up in pubs, and as a result often moved around a lot too since publicans can rarely stay at one place for too long before the company that owns the place decides they're gonna try and squeeze all the pennies out of you they can. However living in that environment also meant I spent a lot of time around drunk adults talking about all sorts of things that a small child probably has no place hearing. 

I also have a sister (16) who also went through this. She's been going to counseling and a clinical psychologist these past few months trying to deal with extreme anxiety. When I say extreme I mean like she'll have panic attacks for no perceivable reason, not even perceivable to her and according to her clinical psychologist regularly suffers from derealization as a result of her anxiety. She also has a terrible short term memory, also as a result of her anxiety. Long and short of it, she's a mess, and the counselors and psychologist types seem to be in agreement that it was growing up how she did and moving around so much as a kid that caused this but only started to become apparent as she got older. She's very immature for her age and I don't mean as in like silly behaviour immature but more in the sense of where as at 16 her friends are starting to show signs of becoming young adults, she does not at all. Her mind and attitude towards life is essentially still that of a child in every way. She's not stupid mind, just child like.

I, however, did not suffer anything like she has despite sharing the same upbringing. If anything I went the complete opposite way to my sister. I developed an interest in political and religious discussion before I was even a teenager and still heavily pursue those interests today almost entirely with an objective interest in learning about them as much as I can more so than just to get involved in the political climate. It was always remarked by teachers, form tutors, head of years, headteachers and bosses from my earliest jobs that I was more mature than most people my age. However whereas my sister always found it easy to get on with kids her age when she was little and became increasingly isolated as her lack of maturity became apparent as she got older, I always struggled to associate with children my own age as I just couldn't relate to their interests, I found them boring. As I got older however though especially into my later teen years my extra maturity became an advantage when it came to making friends and generally getting on with people.

My question is, why? Why did the same upbringing effect me and my sister so wildly differently? Are there any studies/papers on the upbringing of children in this environment? I know some counselors have said that children of publicans very often exhibit similarities with military brats when it comes to mental health. How true is that?

Any information at all would be great.",31May2019,1
129,"I’ve been feeling like, no, for a really long time now. One of my friends says I have depression, and I’m not going to lie, I think so to, but I’m to scared to say it to anyone, beacause any time I think about it, I have a panic attack. 

Everything I do is just no. Study for the leaving cert, which will shape my future? Nope, can’t do that. Not motivated. Try to sleep? Nope, let’s think about every little embarrassing thing I’ve ever done until the sun comes up. Try and pretend to be happy? Definitely nope. I have no energy to even fake a smile anymore, it takes so much energy and effort to even try to maintain a conversation.

In conclusion, I’m just really loving life a lot. Nope.",31May2019,1

131,"Hey everyone, as the title states a few nights ago I came very close to suicide. Obviously I didn't go through with it but since that night I haven't told anyone. I can't get in to see my psych for over a week and I don't know why but just feel shameful going to see my GP. Again, I don't know why, I just do. 

But should I be telling anyone? I kind of feel like I should but also get a lot of anxiety just thinking about it. What do you guys think I should do?",31May2019,1
132,"I've always tried to help people, utilising my social skills. It usually worked pretty good, as it always seemed like I could give that missing piece of advice to someone, or just see what was bugging them that they were not really aware of. Friends often ask me for advice, I'm familiar with NVC etc. 

But there is this case of several people that I've always known have these issues of being unhappy with themselves, making wrong life decisions, and ignoring rational arguments and advice. In their case I eventually learned that I might be doing something wrong this time, as all my best efforts did not help, and I'm sure that if I continued I would only make the matters worse. It seemed that giving them some fresh view of the situation made them more biased with each advice and argument I gave them. I tried to help for some time, but I eventually gave up and just admitted that ""You can't help someone who does not want your help"", I guess to make myself feel better.

Anyway only recently have I realised that the mechanism laying behind their behavior is possibly them trying to cope with severe cognitive dissonance that my advice was causing, and they are afraid to let go of their long held beliefs and refuse to change their behaviors. Obviously the more I tried to help the worse it got - dissonance got bigger, and they coped by producing new delusions  and using some makeshift excuses to deny my advices and justify their beliefs.

To give it some background story: there is this lost man, that has rough history and still causes trouble, and believes that this is not his fault, as he is not only a good person, but also an incredibly smart one. It does not add up so he reasons that it is because everyone was always against him, or that it was just meant to be this way. Unfortunately now this gets deeper, and he is just fortified inside his own mind, justifying beliefs based on his feelings, and openly admitting that he won't take into account any information he does not like. I couldn't believe when I was told he has a response for everything, so I pushed him very hard, and we eventually got to a point where he just admitted that ""I only believe what I like, and I believe it is the truth. So even if your argument is logical, it just means I should not believe in logic anymore"".

There are also some people loving him, and suffering, but refusing to take actions to try and change the situation, I guess out of fear of it getting worse. To make up for that they refuse to see his destructive behaviors. ""We can't do anything about it, it would not work. Also it is not that bad, it was worse back then.""

I'm that type of person that can't stand seeing this but I don't really know how to have them solve this without making matter worse. Also changing their environment or forcing them to change behaviors does not seem to be an option.

I think the only option would be to make them realize the above principles , and possibly also to make them think that they worked it out themselves without any pressure from the outside. What do you think, do you have any ideas, are there any other options? Can I help them? Also, about that guy, should I push it further and say that ""believing what you like is kind of weak and stupid"", in some way that makes him consider his beliefs once more? Also, am I being too manipulative with my help attempts?",31May2019,1
133,"Hi all. 

I’m going to try to make this as brief as possible. Please feel free to ask questions.

I am a 28f 5/6 years into my career. It’s been… Quite an experience to say the least. A roller coaster, frankly. 

I work in the field of advertising/marketing. And I’m starting to get really burnt out because I just don’t feel like I’m accomplishing or where I need to be. Some background, I have a history of  anxiety, and have been medicated and have had therapy for it. I’m not on my meds anymore because of how they made me feel. 

My first two jobs didn’t work out - wasn’t fired just bad abusive management. The third job was just... Incredible. I won awards, was named the top person in my state, etc. they ended up doing a re-structure and I got laid off. My forth Job was just a mess. The job was not only not what was described but I was put on a very unfair and unjust PIP two months into my job there which prompted me to look for another job. My manager was shocked when I put in my resignation at 8 months- well, A month has gone by, you haven’t told me where I stand, and I’m not going to ask where I stand. 

My job now isn’t bad. I’ve been here almost a year. The problem is I started during a re-organization. Actually, my first day was the organization. Two weeks later, my boss accepted a new position, and I was left without a manager for two months ( I was actually reporting to my bosses boss, but needless to say there was a lot of change). 

I haven’t had a lot of direction and my new manager is... she’s okay. Recently I had a performance review and got good remarks with what I thought were fair areas of improvement including my powerpoints being a bit better. 

My counterpart recently quit, and I’m feeling really overwhelmed. My boss and I had a one on one today and she had mentioned how she wants to see all powerpoints as there have been “challenges”. 

We have talked about this, but it just hurt she brought it up again. My self esteem is super low, and I just feel like I’m awful at my job. 

Has anyone felt this way? Am i being over sensitive?",31May2019,1
134,"Hi my name is Aron. I've been depressed for 5 years now and the only thing I have keeping me on this planet is my father. See I grew up loving my mother and hating my dad. This is because he was alway harsh which looking back was him trying to make sure we're ready for disappointment. But over the years I've grown closer to him and its now to the point where we talk with each other about almost everything. I told him about being depressed and thinking about ending my own life (at this point I had scars on my thighs from cutting myself) and we started talking. At one point he says 'if you kill yourself ill kill myself as well because I cant live without you'. I remembered it but didn't talk about it much. Fast forward 2 years and I'm now 17, on antidepressants and having work instead of school. I was working and that sentence popped in my mind and I started thinking. 'if my father dies will I be ready for the world without him?'. No. No I am not ready for a world without him. If he dies in the next few weeks I'll follow him. Theres nothing anyone can do to stop this. Which is why I want him to know I love him. I'm just not ready for him to go. I want him to live and love for me... I want to live with him... I want to live... But I can't... Not without him. This is driving me insane and I dont know what to do.",31May2019,1
135,"Hi all, sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile. My mental health has always been kind of crappy, but I never had any long-lasting issues with eating. I’m starting to notice I’m eating less and less, and when I looked down at the scale, I’m actually really happy and a little tiny voice in my head keeps saying “don’t eat a lot”. This is happened quite a few times for a little bit of over the past four years, but it starts getting worse and worse as life goes on.  I don’t really know how to enjoy food, my mom offered money so I could go get food at my favorite restaurant, panda express, and I prayed and I had the nerve to say “no thank you I’m on a diet”. I’m not sure what to do, as I can’t confide in anyone because everyone is already concerned for my mental well-being as I had a mental break down a couple weeks ago to the point where I was contemplating suicide. I wish I could get over this, because the migraines don’t seem worth it. However, I’m down 7 pounds in just a week so I’m fairly happy but I know it’s not something to be proud about in regards to my method.",31May2019,2
136,"28M. I've had depression for about a decade now. I've been seeing a therapist for about three and have made amazing strides. I no longer have thoughts of suicide and I have the tools necessary to fight the negative thoughts as they arise.

However, some minor things still affect me. I rarely find joy in my hobbies, even when I enjoy them. For example, I'm halfway through a new book. It's a good story, I connect with the characters, and I enjoy reading it. The catch is that I never *want* to read it. Instead, I'll be looking for a time-filler and I'll think: ""I haven't read today, I could do that."" It's similar with all of my hobbies. 

This phenomenon goes for social outings as well. I find myself losing interest and wondering when I can go home and go to bed. It's like I expect the next day to be better, but things remain the same.

I do all of the things that are recommended for depression. I eat healthy, exercise, get enough sleep, drink enough water, meditate, maintain a social life, read, be selfish and take care of myself, travel. I just can't seem to find the little bit of joy that I've lost.

My therapist has floated the idea of trying medication. I have some reservations, but my main inquiry is this: would an anti-depressant help me find the joy I've lost? Will I be excited about my hobbies again instead of having to force myself to do them? Can I just enjoy a care free night out on the town with my friends?",31May2019,1

141,"So, I have a problem. I eat. A lot. The greasier the better. I order takeaway almost every week, multiple times. Pizza, burgers, Chinese food.

 It's gotten out of hand. I used to be good at handling my money, but now I spend every cent I have on food. I can't stop myself. I eat even if I'm not particularly hungry. To the point where I feel sick and embarrased. Or if I'm bored, or watching tv. I can't do it without having something to chew on. 

Sometimes I throw out the leftovers, or even the whole meal once it arrives because I know I shouldn't eat it. But today was a low point. I ate unhealthy crap during the day, and decided that would be that. 

Then I started craving something to eat with my Netflix. I went to the store and got some food. Decided to eat some right away and the rest tomorrow, to be reasonable. But I binged all of it. And felt so so sick that I threw up 4 times into the bathroom sink, with chunks flying everywhere.

I'm so disgusted with myself and I need to stop. I'm not sure if I'm just a gluttonous pig or if I have BED. Please somebody help me, give me tips, scold me or something. I can't do this anymore.",31May2019,1
