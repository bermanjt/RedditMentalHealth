0,"Hello, so in the past couple weeks, there's this guy. He's a friend of a friend. I hang out with him sometimes. But he seems to have, like, mood swings. Some days he's really mopey. He'll just sit at his desk with his head down, sometimes he falls asleep.

But other days, he's very energetic. It's fun sometimes, but some of his behaviors on his energetic days have me concerned. He just says and does things that are...odd.

He tends to be a little obsessive about certain things. He'll talk endlessly about games he's played or some movie he saw. Then, he got this mask. A cheap plastic halloween mask of a sheep and this shirt of the same thing, he treated them like they were the coolest thing. Whenever the teacher was out, he'd put it on. At lunch he wanted to put it on and scare the other kids outside. He brought it to school every day, wore the shirt for about 3 days straight.

One day, i saw him getting bullied. But, he was, you know...smiling and laughing the whole time. Like it was a joke. But i know the bully, he doesn't joke about these things. He's a real bully. Speaking of the bully, he had this wrestling game when i went to his house. He created the bully and was beating him up in the game. I asked why, he said there was no better alternative to deal with it.

There was this girl, he talked about her to the point of obsession. It's all he talked about for a week.

I caught him doing the Naruto run down the hallway, once.

Oh, and a few days ago, he came over for this assignment. He couldn't sit still to save his life. Couldn't focus at all. And, as soon he got to my house, i told him about my parent's rule for no shoes on the carpet. He said ""I didn't know you were Japanese"". Which, we aren't. And he put his shoes on a table. Not the floor, but a table. Then, my weenie dog started to bark at him, like she does all company. He literally got on all four's and started barking back at her. Thank God, my parents didn't see.

Anyway, afterwards, my dad was watching UFC. One of the matches had a triangle choke. He ssaid ""Oh that looks fun. Wanna try it?"", i said no and every day since then, he always asks ""Can i put you in that chokehold"".

That's another thing, i think he might be gay. He seems very, like, hands on. Always wanting to put his arm around other people's shoulder or touching their hair. Just guys though, never girls. Sometimes he'll talk in kind of a lisp. ""Oh, that's soooo fabulous"". He says it anytime something cool happens.

We played badminton in gym class once and he just smacked another boy on the butt with the paddle. Why? No idea. And in the locker room, even after he changes, he just kinda sits on the bench and looks around for a few minutes.

And, he even asked to sit on my lap a few times, as a joke.

But yeah, he seemingly has endless energy. He got in trouble by one of the teachers, and she just kept lecturing him. He cracked a smile the whole time. Made a joke about the vein popping in her head.

Like, nothing gets him down...when he's in an energetic mood at least. He's unpredictable, never violent but he has some bad habits. He's never hurt anyone or anything. I just wonder if i should be worried about his behavior.",23Aug2019,1
1,"My sister and I have shared a room for our whole lives. I’m 20 and I live at home and go to a state college. She just graduated and last week I helped her move into her dorm at a university a few hours away. For about 2 days nobody heard from her. We called the police station and turns out she had been “arrested” after trying to kill herself and is now at an inpatient center. My mother asked her to come home so she is when she is released in a few days. I have so many feelings right now and I’m so confused. 

I’ve been depressed and felt suicidal all my life but I’ve never attempted suicide or really talked about it. It’s not something my family talks about, everyone treats it like a taboo subject. My sister has self harmed in the past but my moms always dismissed it as an attention seeking behavior and never gotten her any help. A few weeks ago she told my mom that voices in her head tell her to kill herself so my mom finally started looking for a doctor for her. My mom isn’t taking this serious either and thinks she did it for attention. 

I know how it feels to feel that way and I also know how it feels to not be taken seriously and to be shamed for it by my mom. I’ve been looking into getting help for myself because I have really bad depression too but now I don’t feel like I can. Like I feel like it’s not as serious because she actually tried to kill herself and I never have. I feel like I can’t be upset about her suicide attempt because she didn’t succeed. And my moms calling her dramatic for it. I don’t feel like I can get help for myself now. I was going to confide in my mom that I’m depressed and see if she could help me find a psychiatrist but now I don’t want to and I feel like I have nobody to talk to. 

I don’t have a dad and my sister and I aren’t close and we really don’t talk about things like that because it’s always been a taboo subject in my house. 

I was also excited to finally have my own room and I feel bad because I’ve been really enjoying it for the past week. I feel horrible for even thinking this but I’m kind of sad that I’m not going to have my own space anymore and things are going to go back to normal. But of course I know it’s probably best for her to come back. 

My mom already asked I told anyone. And when I told her no she said not to tell anyone, even my boyfriend. She said my sister wouldn’t want anyone to know, which may be true but 1. It’s not a shameful thing that we should hide and I hate that my mom is making it seem that way. And 2. I feel like I need to vent about it and now I can’t.  It makes me wonder if I ever killed myself if my mom would try to hide how I died and be ashamed of it",23Aug2019,1
2,"Here’s my story. So in 3rd grade I became friends with this kid in my class and at this time I didn’t know he was insane or had a problem and we were friends that year, he never did anything crazy or got angry. But in 4th grade he started getting angry and that’s when I found out he had tourette’s syndrome, he would always scream and go insane. In 5th grade it got worse, I tried to stay away from him but I couldn’t because I was afraid he would attack me or do something and the school never did anything about it. We were only in the same class during 3rd grade but in 4th and 5th grade we weren’t but I would sometimes hear him screaming and throwing desks in his class. My classroom was next to his. During elementary school my mental health was perfect and I rarely got angry.   But later in 6th grade we were in the same class, we had every class together except PE. He wouldn’t leave me alone I couldn’t get rid of him. I became friends with other people but it was hard to stay friends with them because during lunch he would always sit with us and they would leave because they were scared of him, because anything you do would trigger him. I was with him during all my classes and during lunch, it was horrible. During class, many times he would throw chairs and tables when he got mad. This was almost everyday, the whole class would have to leave and wait outside until he calmed down. During the middle of 6th grade my mental health got worse around maybe March. That’s when I started failing my classes and stopped doing my homework. I stopped attending school. I became very depressed. I told him we couldn’t be friends anymore during the April or something like that and I told him to leave me alone because I couldn’t deal with what he does everyday, and it was too much stress for me. He said ok in  angry way and left. Later that day in class he throw chairs and tables again and was screaming and my name and was blaming me for his stress, and I know he was doing this for attention, because he seemed calm when I told him and I know he was planning to do it in class in front of everyone to make me look like a bad guy. Around late April I left that school, and became home schooled, I mostly left because I stopped doing my homework and wasn’t attending school. I was homeschooled the rest of that year and also during 7th grade. During 6th grade summer My mental health was not good and I would often get mad easily.  I was usually just playing video games and not exercising and I was depressed and I would watch tv a lot and sleep too much. During 7th grade summer my mental health was better, I became more social. Then in 8th grade I went back to that middle school and graduated with good grades, mostly b+. I didn’t really talk to that kid, I saw him a couple times during lunch but we had no classes together. That year I had good friends and I had a good time that school year, maybe one of the best years  in that middle school.  During that summer I was doing pretty ok. Then when 9th grade that’s when everything went downhill, things got worse for me and my anxiety got worse and I was doing pretty good in school and I had pretty good grades. But my mental health was not good and I started getting mad more, during January or February of 2019 I started repeating things like I would have to do things for a certain amount of times,  like I had to count how many times I did something. I would also have to put things in a certain such as how I place my phone on a table or how I put the remote down on the couch or table. This started, maybe during January or February of this year, I don’t exactly remember it could’ve started during March or April. But I’m thinking around January or February. So now it’s gotten worse where it’s affecting my daily life, and I rarely leave the house. Because of how I’m at home all day during summer, time goes by so fast and now school has started and I’m getting even more anxiety and I’m guessing all my troubles throughout the  years could have been caused by what happened to me in elementary and middle school.  I hope this post helps everyone understand what I go through everyday even thought I wasn’t born with a mental illness. I distanced my self from my family and cousins but not my sisters or my parents or, my aunts, but mostly from my cousins and uncles. I deeply regret that. Thank you for reading this. Bless all of you.",23Aug2019,2
3,"I went to a psychiatrist for the first time and was diagnosed with depression and paranoia. Since it's my first time, I mentioned to my psych that my mother probably won't allow me to take medication cause she's a ""holistic"" person. Now my mom makes it all about her, saying she's depressed that I'm depressed, crying, etc. I'm getting worse and she's holding my prescription hostage. Instead of making myself better, I still have to consider ""what she thinks is best for me"".   I'm out of things to do than rot here with my mother's ""pray and you'll get better ways"".",23Aug2019,3

5,"Too much stress, too much uncertainty, too many things I cannot control, too many losses/heartbreaks, being flat broke, getting shunned from your very large family, and feeling like you’re such a burden on the 5 whole people you do have in your life.

6,"I... I just wanted to share this with anyone, someone. I, we need to face reality and seek help. But convincing the Others is a lot of effort.  

My mind is rather fractured. It’s broken into many different pieces but it’s surprisingly whole. And somewhat stable, but nevertheless fractured.

I was a bit neglected as a child, and wasn’t taught any of the basics of life. Or what’s it like to meet people or any advice. There was no advice for anything. So I had to teach myself.  

And over the years. I’ve developed a system to keep my mind healthy, well to keep the body stable. It’s more along the lines of keeping the body stable and the mind stable. It’s not really healthy. 

Over the years, I’ve split my mind up into many pieces.",23Aug2019,1
7,"I’ve always wondered if I have psychotic idk symptoms or tendencies but I’m scared to bring any of that up to my therapist since I feel like it doesn’t effect my day to day life

I mean always as a kid and teenager I had strong serious delusions. Like the biggest one as a kid I remember having a damn near panic attack or melt down or something over thinking everyone could see my thoughts in a cartoon/comic style bubble above my head. Like every time anyone looked at me or laughed or smiled or talked period I just kept freaking out in my head to my self like “they’re laughing at me they can see my thoughts” 

I remember telling my self that isn’t real or possible but it still made me go into like hyper planning mode how to think “normal” so they’d all “stop making fun of me” even tho realistically no one probably was(at that moment anyways bc I got the ever living fuck bullied out of me in like elementary school lol) I think this was in 3rd grade.


The next most delusional thing I remember happening is my boyfriend st the time(now husband) did SOMETHING like.. said something to me over phone call while I was at work and I thought he was spying on me some how?? I don’t remember all the specific details but I know I genuinely thought he was listening to me thru my work walkie/phone mic and watching me thru my phone camera/the work cameras

I put tape over my phone cameras and I was SO MAD AT HIM 

I don’t remember how that situation ended but I think I eventually explained it to him that I know it’s impossible and makes no sense, but that even tho I KNOW FOR SURE that is all impossible, I still FEEL like it’s true.


There have been soo 
So
Many 
Others too all in between those two experiences from like 
Early Elementary school to shit probably now who knows


Anyways I guess
Does this seem like idk abnormal??

I’ve always mostly been able to tell my self that these things are impossible and make no sense.  But at the same time I can’t make my self truly feel that they’re not real. Like I still feel all the stress, the only way I can get thru hem is by forcing telling my self this shit is illogical.



Another one that happened this morning i think is during a 12 mile ruck this morning I was doing from like 4 am to 8 am, when it was still dark I lost track of where I was like.. I got so disoriented I couldn’t tell where I was on my route(which was just a 3 mile lap done 4 times in a row)
It felt like and looked like I was like.. in my home town. I’m no where near there. Out of state 14 hrs away. It just was like.. I was in a small Hampshire ball moving along and anything outside of he light of the street lamps didn’t exist visibly but in my mind it was my home town. 
Idk how to explain it honestly.



I guess while I’m at it I’ve also been recently diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I’m about to be msd boarded out of the army for it, from too many times with suicidal ideation with a plan/intent and resulting anxiety and alcoholism.


That also being said maybe this morning feeling lost and thinking I’m in my home town made me almost SICK to my stomach it was so disorienting. But maybe that’s from idk alcohol withdrawal since at that time I hadn’t drank in like 3 days.

I also have been on lexapro 10mg for 2 weeks now.. so maybe it’s bc of that too 


Idk I’m just rambling st this point


Does this sound like I’m psychotic or something?? Idk if I should mention it to my therapist. I’ve been hospitalized once recently I do not want to go back.",23Aug2019,1
8,"Was diagnosed with ADHD years ago and as I got older its become more and more difficult to manage . my outlook is pretty grim and when shit hits the fan , because Ive acted upon it . quit a job etc or am burnt out dealing with it day to day in the hectic but isolating environment I live in , depression creeps in , one step forward two steps back

I wreckon I'm in for an endless cycle of this , throwing everything away and dissociating from life. Feels like fate 

With an outlook like mine I basically deny myself any chances . like a mental block. Avoiding serious relationships, not committing or just not completely aware I wasn't really in it. I  have thrown away a lot of opportunities. 

It's something I can never get my head around and unless I do something about nothing will ever change.

Depression crops up for many different reasons. it's hard to make sense of it. Fucked up childhood, chaotic life and so much pressure on my shoulders . 

So many issues no idea where to start, when depression kicks in its like a tidal wave , sometimes I think I'm lucky to be alive.",23Aug2019,1
9,"Hi all,

I have had issues with depression and anxiety for several years now. I've been a phd student in STEM during this time, so my demanding work has taken quite a lot of the blame for my issues. I can usually keep ahead of my symptoms by proactively pushing for a good work life balance, and exercising semi-intensely. Exercise will almost always stave away my symptoms for 2-3 days, but after 3 days of being relatively inactive, my mind turns to mush and its a coin flip if I'm going to be an anxious mess or a depressed zombie.

I've been going to a therapist for a few years now, but I've always tried to work out the root causes of my issues before relying on chemicals to patch up a leaking ship.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if my experience is the normal response for a human put in a high demand job, or if I should really consider that I've got a legit chemical imbalance in my brain. Are most people this reliant on exercise, even if they don't recognize it? I wonder if chemicals will make my life significantly better or easier.

I don't expect a diagnosis, but maybe some comments would help me think about the issue.

Thanks",23Aug2019,1

I went out today and I as always I was very nervous and jittery because I have an anxiety disorder and it was a while since I was out ( like 2 days I think) so I just wasn’t feeling very well. I was just walking out from the mall and I felt a bug fly into my face and I tried to get it off but it was still there and it wouldn’t leave. Then it felt like there were even more bugs on my face and then the feeling started spreading all over my body (mostly back) and it felt like there bugs crawling all over me and biting me.

So, I've been diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder as well as General Anxiety Disorder. I've been dealing with both of these for as long as I remember, but my anxiety has been worse as of recent so i decided to go back and get some more counseling to help me and learn how to cope more. My therapist suggested I get a psych eval. I agreed because I wanted something as needed in case a panic attack arises. However, at the end of the psych eval my psychiatrist prescribed me something called Paxil to take every day, only 5 mg. I didnt want something I would have to take every day, but I figured since I have been dealing with these illnesses for so long maybe it's a good thing in tandem with therapy. 

Because I didnt want to be on something every day, I got worked up and had a full blown panic attack in my car in the parking lot of the place for a half hour. I calmed down eventually and talked to my PCP and asked him what he thought of it. He said it isnt possible to get addicted to Paxil, which was one of my main concerns. I'm just trying to do my own research on it before I start taking something I might not want to do. 

Has anyone had any experience with Paxil? If so, please share. I could use the guidance.",23Aug2019,1

Im from Australia if that is needed. 

I want to ask a mental health professional of some kind, mainly a psychiatrist, if waiting 3 years for a diagnosis is typical for the average person.  I don’t want to ask regular people as they most likely don’t have the experience to know.

17,I have a friend who starting dating this guy when she was going to work out problems with another relationship. This guy has moved in in under 3 months and she has completely changed. She isn't really talking to her parents and her ex tried to reach out to know what's wrong and she went off claiming a lot of things that are just wrong. Anyone who tried to talk to her about this new guy got blacklisted and it seems like the guy is preying on her insecurities and depression. He has done just that in the past along with physical abuse. She seems to have stopped going to therapy sessions and stopped taking her meds because of him. We are all worried about her and as I said the ones who brought something up about this guy get blacklisted. She is renting an apartment and he moved in so we can't really do anything to get him away from her. When he moved in she forced her parents to give up the spare key to the place and told them not to come by anymore they aren't allowed. Everyone has noticed a massive change in her she use to be more talkative and our going since the therapy and meds but now she barely talks and interacts and he is basically planning everything and monitoring her. I want to know of anything we can do because she won't talk about anything and she seems like he is mentally controlling her and isolating her from the people that care about her. He has a history of mental and physical abuse and the stories from his ex's are basically the same as what is currently happening. We want to protect her because if he goes off on her she might make a suicide attempt and he won't stop her if she does we know that because one of the ex's did and he just left her to do it.

23,"18 y/o male here!

I dont really know how to explain it but ill try my best. Everytime someone hurts me, or i embarrass myself or feel really strong self hatred/ depression for whatever reason, i become really self destructive.

Id make plans to go on a dry fast for a week (dry fast= no food or water) , and exercise in the heat outside. Or id tell myself “no sleep for a week” or I’d ban myself from contacting my friends, id delete all social media. Id also tell myself, “you cant be happy for 5 days” which basically means i cant smile or laugh or even talk properly to anyone until ive “disciplined” myself. 

Ive done a week water fast and i got so light headed during it i had to skip school. I couldnt not drink water so i gave in because i felt like i was gonna die. Dying/weight loss is never my intention. I just do it to hurt myself.

The longest ive gone with no sleep was 2 and a half days. Of course im only human so i passed out on the couch. I was really furious at myself though so i kept trying to go a week with no sleep but 2 nights was my limit.

Ive tried overdosing on every pain killer we have. Once again my intention is not dying, just maybe rupturing my stomach or something so i make sure not to over do it. I only fall into deep sleep afterwards which is fine by me. I dont want to kill myself, but the thought of hurting myself brings me pleasure. 

Apparently 5 crushed up cherry pits have enough cyanide to kill a human being so i took 3. Nothing happened. 

I also get blackout drunk every damn time i hang out with friends just because. Like puking my guts out and passing out drunk. 

Im becoming more socially withdrawn from my friends and family too. Im always quiet and sad. I dont have a reason to be sad. Nice family and good friends. But i am, or rather i force myself to be. 

My school life is going downhill too. I really do try to study, thats what i tell myself when im not sleeping or eating or talking “youre doing this for you, study hard” or something like this. But my grades have never been worse.

The thing is that for pretty much all my life, the only two emotions I’ve ever really experienced are happy or ambivalent (several of my friends have joked along with me about my limited emotional range), however, over the last year or so, another emotion has entered; moderate depressive phases that tend to last about a week or longer that I don’t know how to deal with.

I’m currently in the midst of a depressive phase and I don’t know what to do. I can’t muster the effort to do anything and it’s affecting my work life. Does anyone have any advice?",23Aug2019,8
30,"My family just took in a friend of my daughter's-we are going to foster her.  Her mom has a drinking and drug problem, but I think there is a mental health component.  She was screaming and yelling at her daughter (which prompted her to call us to pick her up.) Her mother jumped in the shower and was just getting out when her daughter was on her way out the door.  Her mother acted like she had no idea why her daughter was leaving and said, ""Where are you going?  You need to get ready for church."". 

Three weeks later, she still claims to not know why her daughter left.  Social Services were called.  They had her do a drug test and it came back positive for meth.  She is in total denial about it.  She will not admit it to anyone.  She keeps telling everyone that the drug test was clean, and she doesn't understand why her daughter can't come home.  She has refused further testing, yet she claims she has done all the tests and they were all clean.  She even said all this to a judge, and he told her the facts say otherwise.  

She keeps saying someone is messing with her phone, when no one has touched it. You'll have an argument with her, and she'll turn around and act like nothing happened 10 minutes later.  And, the opposite.  Nice one minute, then screaming in your face another.  She's been doing drugs a long time-since high School.  She's in her late 30's now.

Is this behavior due to brain damage from years of drugs, or maybe the drug use started because of mental illness?  Maybe it's a bit of both.

I really want her to get help.  It seems her family and the system have failed them both-she grew up in foster care due to her mother(the grandmother) being a gambling addict.  I don't think they've done a psychiatric evaluation on her.  Is a psychiatric evaluation part of rehab?  Because she's gone through rehab several times at least.

Any insight would be appreciated.  I would like to see her get her life together.",23Aug2019,1
31,"I have always had this because my mother is a perfect, perfectionist. She would complain about tiny things when I did 99% of it right. So to please her, I did everything 100% right. The best compliment was no comment what I need to improve on. And when I had to do something but knew I wouldn’t have the time to do it perfectly I just didn’t do it at all since she would complain if I ”just” did 80% of the chores, so why not let her complain at 0%.


Now it had stuck with me. It leaves me either super focused or I dont even try. I never feel joy in anythin unless I can perfect it. I dont even play games where there is no leaderboard that can show how ”perfect” i am or not.",23Aug2019,2

33,I've always struggled with paranoia. I have been doing so much better lately I thought I was finally getting over it. But here I am laying in bed on a day I have to get up at 5 in the morning just cuz I'm scared to death of what happens when I close my eyes.,23Aug2019,1
35,"I'm irrationally paranoid. At work there is alot of gossip and in order to try to fit in I partake in it. I know that it's happening about me too. I'm paranoid about being fired for taking place in the gossip even though I'm a victim to the environment that already existed upon my arrival here. There are extremely toxic people here who are good at their jobs but seemingly get bored during down time and have nothing else to talk about so they gossip about things that I truly know are worthy of being fired for. I noticed the co worker who sits next to me makes this weird noise and I pointed it out to my other co worker and now I realize I'm contributing to the negativity. Im paranoid and question my worth to the company constantly even though I've never been spoken to about my performance or conduct. My coworkers laugh when I talk about my paranoia and I'm sure they gossip about me when I'm not around. There's one co worker who is the root of all of it but he's also the best worker here so there's no way they are going to get rid of him. He's not even that bad of a guy but he just can't go one day without gossiping about things and talking about why certain people should get fired. I talk to him about my fears of getting fired and he tells me how it makes no sense and that essentially i have 0 percent chance of getting fired. The whole environment is poisonous but I have no choice but to work here. It pays well and it's extremely easy money. I also have transportation problems and the job is extremely close to my home. I want to just come to work and be quiet in peaceful silence to avoid the verbal minefield and potential HR related issues that may occur. Today I pointed out that one of our co workers makes this weird noise when she's on the phone with customers and that I noticed it and it bugs me. He said he's gonna listen for it and tell one of my managers if she heard it and she's gonna think it's funny. I told him that has HR written all over it and he said no it doesn't and that the manager will think it's funny. I'm too deep in. I should have just came to this job and been quiet and positive despite the contagious environment but I feel like now it's too late to turn it around. If I start now then I'm just going to be worried about the gossip about me being the weird guy who fit in at first but now doesn't say anything to anyone. I lose sleep about all of this every night. 

I put myself through all of this for 40 hours a week and then blow all my money on pay day on a crippling gambling addiction that I inherited genetically from my family. The gambling is the only thing that provides me enough immersion to lose myself in it and give myself some time away from the paranoid thoughts. I've been gambling for 6 years and have probably blown 80k on mostly slot machines. I am 25 and have nothing to show for all the work I've put in in college and all my jobs. I live at home with my parents and still have no savings. 

I have medical, IRS, credit card debt. I haven't paid the medical or IRS debts for about 3 years and I haven't paid the credit cards in about 4 months. Everyday I think about getting taken to court and having my wages garnished. I hate myself. I hate my life. I hate my predispition. I hate my decisions to experiment with phycadelic drugs at an extensive rate at one point about a year and a half ago. The paranoia was way worse back then. I thought about people following me, wanting to kill me, wanting to get me locked up etc. With no rational grounds to really think this way. I've came a far way from those thought patterns and am no longer hallucinating these invalid ideas. I'm bored with everything. I have no hobbies or interest in anything. I'm too prideful to even think that I'm going to pay my debts back. I see a dim future for myself in court and everything. Im considering fleeing the country and never coming back but I will miss my family and friends. I feel that I don't make my own choices and that everything is predetermined based off my genetics, environment, and childhood trauma. I'm a complete cop out. I won't take any responsibility for my actions. I'm pathetic.

The phycatrist gave me a shot for paranoid schitzofrenia and I really thought I was gonna die. I couldn't stop moving for 5 days and I was in pure agony and now I'm scared to be treated for my paranoia because of it. I think I'm paranoid personality disorder now because I don't hallucinate so I don't see how I'm schitzofrenic. I'm only currently prescribed anti anxiety medicine and sleeping medicine but oubviously it isn't working. I also smoke pot quite frequently and it feels like it does nothing for me. I've been smoking for so long it just feels like I smoked a cigeratte. I don't even remember what being high feels like other than my acid flashbacks now. My experiences with LSD greatly traumatized me. I had went from being extremely religous to a 100 percent agnostic / nihilist literally after one bad acid trip alone. God use to give me alot of hope. Now I see it as entirely idiotic. The only thing that comforts me is thinking about at night the most sure fire way I could kill myself and succeed doing it. It's the only way I can fall asleep.

36,"long story short, i was really pressured by the people in my life to apply for this new job they thought would be great for me. i wasn’t on board 100% but did it anyways. i ended up getting the job and around the time i started it my mental health plummeted, and it’s been worsening for about 3 months.

i’ve been nothing but negative since (especially since i hate the job i took), and about a month ago my s/o mentioned to me that it’s taking a toll on him when i’m expressing my negative emotions all the time.

trying to figure out how to let them all out. i’ve isolated myself from almost all of my friends and my family is that type of family that doesn’t discuss emotions &amp; how we’re feeling.

37,"Lately I've been struck with how purposeless (my) life seems. I work a pointless job for a big company (at home) so I can make money to live alone in this apartment in a city where I don't know anyone. Nothing has any point. I'm stuck in this loop. I can't quit because then I can't afford my bills. The bills only support this life I kind of hate. I'm trapped. The only reason I have this job is because I stayed with the company so long - so no where else will pay me the same type of wage.  I'm concerned if I move out of the city, I will become even more disconnected.

Hello everyone,

My name is Allison and I’m seeking advice and guidance for my partner. She is 26 years old, a PhD student, and she has been dealing with some difficulties with something we are calling blackouts. We are writing this post together as an attempt for us to reach out to find what good next steps would be since they are causing her a lot of distress.

The blackouts started a year and a half ago and occur irregularly, averaging 2-3 times a month, and we are still trying to identify their cause. She doesn’t use drugs, and hasn’t drank alcohol since this began. They happen at various times of the day. Sometimes they seem to be triggered by a stressful interaction with another person, but other times they come out of nowhere. During the blackouts she continues to do normal things: she eats, talks with people, and on one occasion she even wrote herself a reminder and apparently drove to pick up dinner. Despite that, she does not act like herself during the blackouts. She varies in how she acts: sometimes quiet, sometimes talkative. In general however, she tends to say things that she would not otherwise. Sometimes they are harsh or out of character. On a few occasions she has even been hostile.

These actions alone are distressing for her but following the blackout she has no memory of what happened. Anything she said, wrote, or did is completely lost to her as though she has amnesia for that period of time. These have all been isolated incidents and she has thankfully been able to function normally outside of these blackouts.They seem to occur outside her school and work times and to mainly occur when she is interacting with people she is intimate or close with.

She has been to her general practitioner doctor, a neurologist, and a neurosurgeon, and had an MRI and EEG, all of which confirmed there is no neurological cause for the blackouts and they suggested it might have to do with stress. She has also confirmed with her gynecologist there are no hormonal issues. She is on a waiting list for a psychiatrist but the timeframe for it is uncertain. To make matters worse, she had a very unhelpful experience with the therapist she’s been seeing for the past year. Her therapist said she was “stumped” and at a loss on how to proceed. She was really hoping that therapy would provide guidance and hope for her with these difficulties. She also recently visited a local general mental health support group which was full of kind people, but it wasn’t very helpful for her particular problem.

We are hoping for a few things here. Firstly, it would be nice to hear from others who experience something similar to blackouts. My partner is feeling very alone with what she’s dealing with and the lack of assistance from medical professionals has made things very daunting. Secondly, suggestions on next steps or good resources would be very appreciated. At this point, we are in a bit of waiting game for the psychiatrist and it would be good to have more immediate steps.

Any help, insight, guidance, or advice is much appreciated. Thank you very much from both of us.",23Aug2019,2

My friend told me something tonight. He said ""this is crazy, but have you seen black mirror archangel?""
Then he went on to explain he had an implant in his brain and that the government was watching him all the time and that it must be due to suspected drug dealing (I don't think he is or was a drug dealer). He continued to say that his house, car and parents houses are all bugged and he can hear them chattering some times. He says that people will acknowledge his thoughts without him speaking them aloud. He is on a lot of medications for ibs that is beyond ibs. I'm not certain what he is on but it's a list pages long. He is also on anti depressants and xanax and had gone on and off different meds for years. 


Obviously I cannot diagnose him but he is certain he's not mentally Ill and that this implant is 100% real.

46,"Has anyone gotten disability income for anxiety or depression (more notably anxiety in my case)? 

How did that process go? I've done freelance work since 2016 and started out alright, but since the end of 2017 I've worked less and less because of my anxiety and depression. 

I've tried medicine but it doesn't help a lot. And as time goes by the more anxious I get, in both my professional and personal life. Sometimes I can't even traverse a grocery store without a panic attack and more than half of the days in a week I can't do basic household chores without getting extremely stressed, even with help. 

Is there a way to get disability income for anxiety? I don't have a doctor right now and the previous one I had wasn't very helpful to patients who had more than an easily treatable/curable illness.

This is my first reddit post so please don’t be too harsh about my English even if I’m a fluent speaker of it lmao

So I’m 14 and I will be the ripe age of 15 in December so you may be thinking that I’m in the prime of my life but it’s quite the opposite.

I’ve been struggling with suicidal and really negative feelings for about 4 years now, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything but I’ve seeing people on and off for a while now. I recently started seeing a psychologist again after I had started self harming again after 2 years and after one of our sessions, she suggested that I could have depression with everything had told her.

I ended freaking out over it as having a answer to what I’ve been feeling after such a long time was really crazy to think about as it had become normal for me, mental illness runs in my family so I wasn’t completely oblivious to the possible reason of depression but I’m really scared because there’s never been a proper reason why so just having a reason now just terrifies me.

I’m also part of the LGBTQ+ which has been struggling throughout my life so far due to teasing (Of well being “straight” and dating my friend (boy) ) and self loathing/acceptance. I’ve had people say not very nice things about it so I’m secretly insecure about my sexuality even if my friends and family are very accepting (some of them are actually somewhat not straight too so they can relate)


Things have become worse these past few days, I’ve been distant with my friends because I believe they would better off without me and the suicidal thoughts have become stronger so I’m just really stuck on what to do in life at the moment, I feel like I’m dead already even though I’m physically alive.

My family and friends know about what has been happening and they are very supportive and really care for me but I have a friend who is judgemental even though he calls it “questioning” and he has known some parts about it but I haven’t told him anything since last year because he’s been really just crushing my self esteem. He’s a really good friend but some things he just says is just horrible, it’s become a lot worse ever since I returned back from school (about 2 months ago) so I’m scared about him finding out.

So any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you so much :)

I abused my meds and had alcohol while on them; ten years later, I'm a recovering alcoholic (14 months) and my depression is manageable most of the time but I still get hit with exhausting lows that leave me drained and feeling like I want to die. My anxiety is terrible. I can't be in a small room full of people, I push others away, I'm incredibly rough around the edges/rude at times and I know it.  I'm doing what I can to get better; I've started a strict diet/exercise regime, I do more chores around the apartment, use cognitive behavioral therapy, and try to create more.

I haven’t touched it in a year. On top of that I currently have a full time job as well as a million other stupid things that I need to do or have needed to do for a long time. 

So now I have setup the base for my real issues. A couple days ago the girl that I liked and had been talking with for about 2 months just called me. Keep in mind that it was not obvious that I liked her and she most definitely knew. She called to tell me that 3 hours prior to calling me she had sex with her ex and then proceeded to explain in great detail everything that happened. So is destroyed as I was I want along with it and hoped her luck in getting back with him.

Now just today is icing on the cake. This is what sent me over. I have been in a discord server with about 23 people whom I would call friends... well I fucked that up. They ended up kicking me from the server. And to be honest I don’t blame them I’m quick to anger and over the dumbest thing too, I am not funny and I’m a dickhead at times. So yeah either way the felling of loneliness is killing me. Every second it eats at me. So I thought instead of totally breaking down like I have been for the past hour crying drinking rum out of the bottle in the shower I would try and find help.

The earliest memory I have of my stress manifesting into a physical illnesses was when I was 12 years old. Within hours of my grandfathers funeral I was vomiting, I had diarrhea, and an extremely high fever. 

It wasn't until recently that I realized I only become physically ill when something stressful occurs. Lately I've been experiencing what I thought were allergies, although I'm not allergic to anything, and have never had an issue with even dust. I've had a lot going on this past year, and recently it feels like anything will cause me to sneeze. 

The last time I got really sick, was last February, when my husband attempted suicide, which ultimately got us evicted from out apartment. Once everything settled down, and we had a stable place to live, I was sick for almost 2 weeks with the flu.

What can I do to stop getting a cold, or the flu, every time something terrible happens?",23Aug2019,14
61,Everything in my brain hurts. I just want someone to help me but no-one will help me.  I want to be looked after. I want doctor's to help me. I'm sick.

63,"I feel like at the age of 30 I'm not sure if I'll be able to convince myself to play by all of the rules of society. Sometimes I rather just be on the fringe of it all, doing my own thing and letting my mind roam freely amidst the strange and beautiful thing that is the world. It's really far too wondrous, that I can't help but be amazed by it all. I love technology, and the incredible intricacies of all different forms of life. I just repeatedly focus on what I \*can't\* do/have/etc, and I am practically stuck in a fantasy-like way of thinking about things after being so enveloped in fantasy roleplaying and ways of escaping the real world.  


  


  


  


  


  
I genuinely question how I could go from living the life I'm living now to working a rewarding career doing something I'm passionate about. Cowering in fear and hiding away for too long certainly makes it harder to relate to others. My mind races and races while I miss out on the current moment. My life is...

64,"I have always wondered if I have some kind of mental disorder. I dont want to go to a therapist not being sure i have something. To not embarass myself. Alright, here it is.

Sometimes when i cant do something and I keep failing at it over and over again like tieing my shoe, cleaning something, doing homework etc. etc. I have this thing where i just start crying, my stomach hurts and i hyperventilate with no control. Sometimes it gets to the point where i want to throw up and i feel like everybody is looking at me. Im pretty normal most of the time.

This also happens when somebody or me drops something that i like and that is mine. For example i am a speedcuber (i try to solve a rubiks cube as fast as possible) and when somebody (or me) drops the cube, I become really stressed out. Its not under my control and I hate when people say things like ""man up"" and ""what are you crying about!????"" Because that makes it even worse.",23Aug2019,3

66,"I am posting this purely for those who may be concerned about weight gain caused by antipsychotics. 

&amp;#x200B;

I gained about 15kg since I went on risperidone last year. I didn't realise it was the risperidone at first, until I started to put the pieces together... ""Weight gain"" is listed as a common side-effect in the brochure; appetite increase and slowed metabolism are listed online; nearly EVERYONE on online forums who were on risperidone said they gained noticeable weight (some gained up to 30kg); on the days I forgot to take my risperidone, I would barely feel hungry the next day, consistently, and so I would eat normally (and, of course, the day after I DID take it, I would pig out and experience overwhelming cravings all day). It made sense. This drug is what made me compulsively overeat. That's what made me gain weight. It was bad enough that I hated my body before this - the weight gain just tipped me overboard. I was so miserable. I honestly didn't even know why  I was on an antipsychotic in the first place. No one had ever given me an explanation. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I visited a psychiatrist a few months ago, I told her I wanted to taper off the risperidone. She asked why, and I said, ""Well, I gained 15kg in the last year-"" and she abruptly cut me off, saying, ""Risperidone would NEVER make you gain weight. At most, in a worst case scenario, you would gain 1kg."" So I asked her why I'm on risperidone anyway, and I swear to you, she said, ""I don't know, obviously someone wanted you to be on it for a reason."" Umm... so not only am I never told that reason by anyone, she also doesn't bother to look through my file and find out?? Okay. That's besides the point, though. I started secretly reducing my dose anyway, going down to 1mg. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last psychiatrist I saw was MUCH better. After my evaluation he said, ""I'm not prescribing you risperidone this month, you really don't need it."" Yessssss, finally. So now I am down to 0.25mg, and guess what? I've already lost 6kg and I'm slowly losing more every week. My appetite isn't like an untamed tiger anymore. I actually feel full now. I am no longer obsessing over consuming whatever junk I can find and stuffing my face even when I am not hungry. It's a relief. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is just one of the benefits I have experienced from tapering off. I am starting to feel much happier, clear-minded and energetic without it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I am not advocating stopping a medication you NEED to be on just so you don't gain weight. Your mental health is always more important than what your body looks like. And trust me, I am not trying to scare you - you probably wouldn't gain as much as I did, anyway (as I already had a predisposition towards overindulgence and putting on weight very easily). However, if you do already have deeply ingrained body image issues and a sincere fear of gaining weight, do bear my and others' experiences in mind when you are discussing with your doctor whether to go on an antipsychotic. I know very well that for people with these problems, weight gain can make them feel even more horrible. You just gotta do what's best for you, whether that be taking the medication and dealing with the side-effects, or not taking it and finding something else that works for you. Personally, though, if I had known beforehand that it would make me so miserable with myself, or that I didn't actually need it at all, I would've come off it much sooner.",23Aug2019,4

69,"I had a very strong and terrible nightmare about 7 years ago. I can remember it badly but I know that my mother made an old Russian prayer on or for me with a candle over my head and I should paint the head of the figure and then tear it. In this dream was a green black and very tall Figur with big yellow eyes (like from the cat of Alice in Wonderland)(the Body was like the body of Babadook (movie)). After a few days, I was fine again but from this moment the Horros has taken its course.

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning, it was just mild dizziness, just like that. but then over time it got stronger and stronger. Then I started to see this figure again. I do not see her directly but in the corner of my eye or feel it behind me.

&amp;#x200B;

For about a year, this ""dizziness"" has become so strong that I get tingling, cramping, breathe badly and forget for a short time where I am what I wanted to do and in the last 5 months it has already happened I forget who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, I can not see anything during the dizziness. Although that is not quite right. I see a ,,different world,,. There is everything black but with a hint of gray. I see some figures or shapes. I do not know what I'm seeing, but it scares me for no reason. And when I have that feeling again what I had when I had this nightmare. Only next to when I feel all the things until this dizziness stops because thereafter I feel nothing not even myself. When everything is over, I feel like I've come into my body as if I've been away for a while. In addition, I almost only have that when I am alone at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that sounds stupid but I am afraid that I have such a strong ,,attack,, at some point that I do not know who I am and that forever or worse. Like when I have  Woman and Kids or something like that.",23Aug2019,3
70,"Honestly my life seems pretty nice — coming from a generally supportive and loving family, going to a prestigious university, doing rather well in life without much to worry about. I feel like I shouldn’t be complaining about anything. 

However, I don’t know since when I’ve been feeling as though life is purposeless. I can’t pinpoint exactly what’s wrong, but I’ve been consumed by a sense of extreme emptiness. I am lacking the passion to really pursue any hobbies, and I find it hard to make lasting connections with people. It bothers me quite a bit — is it natural for life to be meaningless and relationships to be superficial or is there something fundamentally wrong with my personality. Perhaps I’m just too apathetic?

I don’t really care if I die, and I secretly want to end my life so I can stop feeling bad all the time, but a sense of guilt is keeping me alive. My parents invested and sacrificed so much to make me who I am today. I pretend to joke about suicide sometimes and they always get offended when I talk about my death. I know that my death would devastate them and they can’t even think of that as a possibility. 

I’m going to college soon. I’m excited for things to get better but I know they’ll probably not. Life feels like a sinking ship and I want out :)",23Aug2019,1

73,"This summer I decided to get a job, and after a month in I only found a place as helping hand of a supervisor at a factory.

 The problem wasn't the job at all, I liked what I did and my supervisor was a sweetheart. The problem was that the job is at the village my mother grew up in. ( she had gone to the city and built herself a life there, where I grew up). 

I hated coming to visit so much, my grandma was an ashole, all of the kids would insult me and throw firecrackers at me, they terrified me. 
And the thing that I hated the most was teens insulting me on the street. They would come with their bikes, scream something hurtful while biking, then turn around and come back to do the same.
After that happened twice I stopped going out at all. Just kept inside my grandmas home and watch TV until we went back to the city with my mother.

 Now, it's been a while since I had been there, and I've grown up so i went to work there anyways. I really thought all of that had stopped, so I went out with my cousin when i was free. 

But no. While walking to work at six in the morning, three 30 year olds started walking behind me and screaming. They where indeed, screaming at me, a lot of hurtful things and all I could think is ""no way this is happening again"",I just walked faster and at some point one of my mothers friend asked me if they where screaming at me and if that was why I was crying, but I just told her I was on my way to work and kept walking ( I can barely talk while crying). 

Since then I didn't go out again in, my grandma told me I was lazy and I just took it because I dont want to go out and that's it.

 
Today I've decided the pay isn't enough to keep me working, I made my bags and told the supervisor that I was going back to the city to prepare for college. My grandpa just took me to the station and I'm now on a train on my way home. 

Being at home alone so much was bad for my mental health and I started to feel very depressed, not to talk of the fear of going outside. So I feel I took a good decision for myself. 

TLDR: I hate the village I work at, I was insulted on the street and the fear of going outside it caused was bad for my mental health. So I just upped and left.

How can I exclude the possibility they're just lying to me and acting really well? Sure, I can determine if someone is deceiving me if they tell me something and later I hear them telling something different to another person. It sounds kind of absurd to think my close friends and family would go this far to lie to me and I don't feel like they're lying.

77,"So, apparently this is my first post on reddit and Iam not really experienced with it but I want to ask and share something. Apparently I struggle with depression since at least two years and I am getting better lately. Ive taken medication for over half a year now, so these are helping but I don't think they are the leading cause of what is helping me. In that time when I was very depressed (in this winter) I've made lots of sport (I play football since I was 7 and often went to the gym) which was like very intense sport (with hearth rate levels up to 190 bpm or so; I've always wanted to be pro but with the realisation of ""that it might be to late"" would be a trigger for the depression).  
 I always thought this kind of workout would lift up my mood and sometimes it did. But I would think it caused more harm than it helped and since then I don't make that sport very often and think this would be one big factor of how I am getting better (sure there might be other factors to; and I've been in therapy for at least one and a half year). And in Soccer practice, I trie to give my best as usual but if it gets to exhausting I will slow down and take a break (in the training) to protect myself (if that is logical to you).   


So I don't know if I am right here but had someone in a similar Situation had a same experience? Did you try Sports and in what kind of heart rate section do you train?  
And someone in a diffrent situation, what has helped you to get out of depression?",23Aug2019,1
78,"I don't really know where I'd be able to discuss this sort of thing on the internet, though I suppose this is a good place to start. The thing is, I think I might be a compulsive liar, and this is really the first time I'm confronting that to myself. I've always been quite an anxious person and gone through chronic bouts of anorexia, so 'not trusting myself' is certainly not a foreign concept to me, but I'm starting to not be able to trust myself **at all**. I guess I realised I might have a problem with lying today once a few of them caught up with me and destroyed my relationship with my best friend, though I had absolutely no reason to lie in the first place. Never. They just flow out of me, and I don't even realise I'm lying half the time until they're already out. In my head, they're just syllables. You see, I lie about the stupidest things - literally, the most insignificant, inconsequential things things in the world, and then they just cumulate into unnecessary messes. Today I lied about attending a protest march, what meat I like to eat, and what musical instruments my siblings play. Earlier in the week I lied about getting tickets to a music festival I have absolutely no intention of going to. Sometimes the lies are bigger. I've been having to keep up this stupid one I said about five years ago about my nationality. I've also lied about where I grew up and what countries I go overseas to on my holidays. Most of the time the lies make me look better, but sometimes they're self-degrading. I just have no purpose to lie, but they just come out so easily that it takes more effort to recognise they're lies than to form them in the first place.

I guess I wanted to put this here to see if anyone else is going through the same things. It's ruining all of my relationships one by one. I'm even ruining my relationship with myself. I'm struggling to be able to distinguish what is reality and what is fantasy created by these lies, especially in regard to my own memories.

I've started seeing a therapist, but we've only recently completed session number two. She's a nice enough lady.
I sought out some help as after a breakup in April I was feeling completely dead inside. My ex and I had some issues and emotionally I got to a place where I just couldn't deal anymore. We had a cat, whom I loved so dearly, and now... I don't even miss him. I don't miss her even though I think about her often. I have thought about just up and leaving everything in my life behind just on a whim, and it didn't bother me to know my family and friends wouldn't have any idea what happened. Logically, I could recognize this as ""probably not a good thing, so let's talk to someone so can help wrangle the brain demons.""

I've started smoking as a result of being diagnosed with RA. My body hurts all the fucking time, the meds are barely effective, and I'm 29. 
A couple weeks ago I was smoking some weed and had a really bad high. You know how you have a few layers of consciousness? The one that actually is your voice you use to speak with others. One that is your instantaneous thought, ""this is cold. I'm annoyed at xyz. ..."" The filter in between. I felt like I was ten layers deep and just stuck. Every second literally felt like twenty minutes, and it was torturous.

It got to the point where I was questioning my own reality and the best analogy I've found is: ""If you've ever watched Rick and Morty, consider the game 'Roy.' I felt like I'm Roy who has realized he is just a game: the player unable to remove the headset. Why does anything matter now? The goal of Borderlands is to get the loot and kill the bosses, but if Roland were to realize his world was just a game what motivation does he have for anything? Why would he place value in anything? Why is it important to fight against Jack - a man who no longer matters.""

This train of thought extended beyond my high. After sobering up, I was still having this existential crisis / realization of reality.

I couldn't understand values any longer. The importance of anything. Even something as base level as ""Why do you care about being happy?"" just wasn't there any more. 

Eventually I smoked again, started having the same bad high feelings and realized it was because I was high that I felt that way. Put some of it to rest.

But now... After some reflection, I am terrified to be alone. Without the ability to interact with someone, to distract, I am constantly lost in evaluating my reality. Why does this matter? Aside from societal norms, why should I not say fuck it and go do xyz? Why should I even give the societal norms any value? I don't understand anymore. I used to be so comfortable with everything: no god, death, I am my own person, morality, ... Everything. And now I feel broken and trapped inside my own head. And yet more free than I've ever been, and it's not a good thing.

I feel like if anything, prior to these thoughts I was drugged and happy (and, to be clear, I don't mean I was literally drugged - I've always been the type to have my shit together, and almost never under the influence of any drugs). That I have simply opened a box in my head and it can't be put back. 

I continue to do the normal daily things simply because I know I was good before and hopefully I can get back to it with help. But I don't know what is wrong. I don't know how to word it, and as a result afraid the help won't come. I just feel broken and... Psychotic.",23Aug2019,1

I’m not even 30 but I feel like the best years of my life have just slipped through my hands. I have so many regrets. What could’ve been, I’ll never know because I was so careless with what I said and did. I replay moments and think, maybe if I had worn different shoes, maybe if I had just said hello to x,y and z things wouldn’t have fallen apart, maybe if I hadn’t said this, maybe if I had been more outgoing, maybe if I had saved my money, maybe if I had been more picky things would be different. But the truth is, I’ll never know. I know I will never know and I can’t accept it for some reason. 

I long for the happiness and hopefulness I felt just a few short years ago. I miss the magic that life held. I miss how things felt “new”. I could’ve faced the entire world head on, and in some sense I did. Everything seems so dull and lifeless now like there’s no light in life, no hope anymore. It just is what it is and I have to accept the unhappy dullness of it all right now. But I don’t want to. I want the sun to shine on my face and just erase all of the pain I feel just like it used to. 

I just feel like someone or something is missing from my life and I’m just waiting on them/it to show up. Maybe I’m feeling empty? I don’t know but it’s horrible and I just want it to pass.",23Aug2019,2
92,"Long story short but I’ve been feeling suicidal for a couple of months. Lost my father in an RTC 9 years ago when I was 16, lost my dog, recently broke up with the love of my life, which has then resulted in losing the home we bought together, her family (who took me in and treated me as if I was family), and now I’m being made redundant.

My work have been extremely helpful in trying to get me the help I need, despite my resistance in that it won’t help (I can’t change the circumstances, only how I feel about them). A week ago they called an ambulance and had a brilliant session with them, who then referred me to A&amp;amp;E which was a long wait for a short session. That resulted in talking to the Crisis Team (UK, as the name implies they help with urgent cases) which the outcome was to talk to a GP. Signed up and spoke to the GP yesterday and they suggest that I talk to another local team next week. Prior to seeing the GP however, I was detained in custody for 10 hours for my safety, to then speak to a group of 2 mental health professionals and 2 psychologists — the outcome of that again was the GP. 

I feel like I’m just going round in circles with long hours waiting in empty rooms to talk to somebody, to be told I need to see somebody else.

I also strongly believe they cannot help me. As much as everybody says that is relatively normal, I just don’t know how to feel. I feel absolutely helpless. I’m only taking up this help as my friends and colleagues are very invested in helping me, and literally holding my hand to see these people.

Where do I go from here? Thanks.",23Aug2019,10
93,"I’ve been taking Wellbutrin for about a month now for depression, and sometimes I get this feeling of slight dissociation or a numb, tingling sensation in my head or body. I have episodic derealization, and I was wondering if Wellbutrin could possibly trigger an episode.",23Aug2019,1
94,"I'm tired. I'm tired of everything in life. I'm an adult who has been severely depressed for the past 4-5 years or so. I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING GOOD!!! I can just feel the bad things. I don't have any self confidence, I don't any friends. I struggle making friends. My family is under a lot of stress all the freaking time! I can't and don't want to approach them because I know how much pressure they have financially. I mean like we owe $100000 or even more to a lot of people. I'm just an adult who doesn't know how am I supposed to pay it back quickly because it's just too much pressure and I want to save my family from this burden but the interest is killing me when we're not able to pay the amount of debt to someone. Also, I'm from a developing country like India and Pakistan so like 1 dollar is equal to like 75 bucks here. I don't how how am I supposed to pay off the debt. How am I supposed to get out of this soul sucking depression and actually feel something good for once? How am I supposed to live when I can't even afford to consult a psychiatrist for my condition when I feel like life has just been killing me forever. Even if I work hard and get over my depression and start paying off all the debt, it will take almost 40 years of my life to do that and I don't know if I will burnout and go crazy and become depressed again or not. I NEED HELP. I'm done letting life do this to me and my family. Please someone help. Guide me somewhere at least!! I don't want to see my family like this. 

I SURRENDER.",23Aug2019,1
95,"Let me started by saying I grew up with a mother who always told me adhd is not a real thing. I believe she'd give an excuse that kids are just hyper. 

Growing up I had difficulty reading which lead to my poor grammar, spelling, and math problems with words. I had 3 brothers that often made fun of me for this. They are good people but just teased a lot. My parents would jump in with the teasing and I'd cry and my mom would say I'm too sensitive. I'm not sure if this is true or not but it hurt my confidence. Plus I already had poor confidence with how I look. As school went on I did okay unless there was a math problem on the board or I had to read aloud. Oh my gosh the anexity made me sick. I stare at the problem and just can't solve it. I hear anyone laugh and I want to cry, even if it wasn't at me. In school I got some A's but mostly B's and C's.

I do love learning especially with science and history. I specifically loved a teacher what would test us in essay form. She didn't check grammar or spelling but you just wrote everything you could remember and get points from that. It was amazing and I did very well with this. I'm sure it was a mess just like this post though.

I went to college and unfortunately only did 2.5 years. It is a blur. The first year I failed everything. I was put into a class that help keep you organized and focus which actually placed me on the Dean's list the following year. Then the next year I fell through again. I started dating at this time and from there on out I had fail relationship after relationship. I had a nasty temper and just never thought people were telling the truth. I was so insecure. I had went through at least 6 longer relationships and none worked. Once 23 hit I also started drinking. It helped with the anexity I got from social interaction. I to be social but I dredded it. Before and after I hung out with people. I would just think over random thoughts and be like, ""oh my god why did I say those things!?"" Or ""why do people even like me?"" My mind would always be racing on what people thought of me to random other things. It was like my mind never got rest. This lead to more failed relationships, drinking, and not being able to hold a stable job. I thought this was because of anexity or depression. 

My dad died when I was 21 after being sick on and off for years plus all my grandparents. Which started random thoughts about death and the after part. This would create panic attacks later in life (currently) and this extreme fear of death. I was never suicidal but one time during a huge fight with an ex I had downed a bottle of ibuprofen. We were drinking a lot too. We drank almost every night. I was definitely an alcoholic. I really believe this made me calm or focused. It wasn't until recently that I met someone else who is a saint. He is the most calming person and it help me a little. I was still drinking and sadly I was hiding it in places so my boyfriend wouldn't know. I'd black out more than I'd like to say. I would have a stressful day at work and or my brother's brain tumor diagnosis that made me feel it was okay to have a little to calm down all my thoughts. My thoughts wouldn't just be on this things. I mean it could be any random thing in the world, like what was the Egyptian lifestyle like. Again, I love learning just at my own pace and on what I want. I get bored VERY fast though. So I would jump topics all the time. I'm pretty good a random trivia though! 

Anyways, I realized I was an alcoholic and I hated that I was doing this to my boyfriend. He would hide it from me and I'd feel sick about it. I could and cant lose him. I finally went to doctor A. She put me on effexor and we tried propranolol (did nothing), clozapine(hated it), and gabapentin (which help a ton but I can't really tell if it's still working.) The effexor alone did me absolute wonders. I stopped drinking. I stopped the day I started the meds. I haven't looked back and it's never on my mind except being proud of myself and this felt like an accomplishment that I couldn't really blurt out to anyone. I lost 15lbs. I 5'2 and I was pushing 130ish and above. I'm not really active though. The effexor side effects make me kind of eh and tired, but it isn't the worst. My emotions seem way better except I instead of constantly worrying I'm thinking about so many random things. I spend way to much time on my phone just researching random stuff. So my work life is still being interfered with these thoughts and unfortunately I haven't been able to get much more than an administrative assistant job. Ironically I had to take a personality test that my boss swears by and said that my score was great for this position because I enjoy doing all kinds of subjects and not more focused like our accounting departments. Though for my performance review I did get docked for looking or things and careless mistakes. I don't want to be in this position but I just never felt I could finish anything else.

My hobbies are all gone. I just can't focus on them. Video games that I loved just never happen. I just feel stuck. I feel happy though! I keep positive! Again, effexor helped a great deal I'm just scared it will stop. I'm also terrified about weening off. It sounds like torture.

So here I am, with a new doctor because doctor A was extremely disorganized (I am too.) and had no staff. She lost my records on top of other things. Plus I was really upset about being put on benzos which I told her I really did not want to start. 

This new doctor seems very genuine and got me talking so much. However when I left I was like, ""holy cow my conversation was all over the place."" I don't even know if he could understand everything. The things that scared me is that he suggest taking me off my 150mg of effexor. Which felt like a life saver. He knew before i said anything that my sex life was non existent and I do really feel bad about this. Not that it was great before it but it's nowhere now. I feel so bad for my boyfriend. He never complains though. I guess there are other side effects too but they seemed okay to put up with. I told him as of this time I cant think about stopping it. 

As we kept talking he did mention I seemed to show some signs of adhd. I laughed because I have never heard this and again all my life I believed it was made up. I have looked up symptoms before and thought, ""nah that's not me and I'm not hyper."" But as I searched more things seemed to fit with it. I'm not sure if anyone saw an article about rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) and link to adhd, but rsd describes exactly what I feel a lot. So here I am. I'm very confused and not sure what i have. I'm worried about losing the effexor and what my new mental health plan would be. 

I know I need to bring this up to the doctor, but did anyone else have symptoms like this and is it at all related to adhd or is it just general anxiety? Am I just lazy and not motivated? Is it even worth considering? Do people get over diagnosed with adhd? My doctor mention a test I needed to take but our appt was around 2 hours and we both forgot. I'm not even sure if that was what the test was for. 

In my mind I thought adhd was a super hyper person that just talks all the time. Sorry, I was ignorant to all of it. Thank you all for taking this time to read this. Sorry for the mess and word vomit. I really appreciate it.

Edit: Oh not to sound gross but I have this real bad urge to pick scabs. I hate it. I have to put band aids on. Nothing at all has helped me with this. I have lots of scars. It's really sad. Anyone have this?",23Aug2019,4

97,"So, on Wednesday, I found out I was allergic to cats, and I felt extremely suicidal and depressed. 2 days later, I'm back to being energetic. This happened several times before, either because I messed up something, or it just randomly happened. I used to shrug it off as ""I'm just sensitive"", but now it's been worsening, and I think something is actually wrong with me.

I suspect that I have depression (haven't been diagnosed yet), but this behavior is starting to make me think it's something much worse, or my ""depression"" is actually non existent. I still have low motivation and apathy during both ""phases"", so I somewhat doubt myself for having bipolar.

I'm not necessarily seeking a diagnosis from here, but some insight on what *might* be happening would be appreciated.",23Aug2019,1

99,"Had my first real session today, I'm really new to this whole therapy thing. And now like 2 hours later I can't help but feel really embarrassed and stupid over how much I revealed about myself. I hate talking about myself. I keep over-analyzing everything I said, maybe I was being too dramatic and one time I fucked up what I was trying to say so now I feel like an idiot about that. And I feel so exposed. Like, in my family we don't talk about our feelings and thoughts and shit. 

Should I bring this up next appointment or just like suck it up and keep going and feeling embarrassed?",23Aug2019,241
101,"It's hard to even know where to begin, I'm unsure if I'm even in the appropriate subreddit. As the title states, I had what I suspect to be an extreme psychotic reaction to THC. The only way I can illustrate to anyone what I experienced requires me to explain chronologically. It's a lot so get ready for a wild ride.


I was with friends, and we partook of some relatively potent THC product. I felt fine at first, I struggled to take the hit because I don't smoke much, but I felt fine enough to sit down and remain fairly grounded in reality. Slow at first, I started to get intense vertigo. The vertigo became more and more intense until I suspected that perhaps what we smoked wasn't just THC.


My two friends were acting weird at this point too, like completely out of it and I wondered, maybe they feel the same, maybe this shit is affecting all of us. And I thought, this is starting to get bad. So slipping in and out of consciousness, I grabbed my phone and pulled everyone out of the house, because at one point I thought maybe there is a gas leak. I pull them out and make sure the door is closed so my cats don't get out, even though I guess if it was a gas leak they'd just be dead, but there is still this rational part of me trying to keep things under control. 


It's a struggle, but I managed to dial 911. The other two were trying to stop me so I ran away from them when the operator picked up. I told them I was having a really bad drug trip and I needed help. All the above I know happened because my friends confirmed it. But after that I ran out of earshot. I remember the operator asking me where I was and who I was. As I perceived it, I was able to answer all of her questions perfectly, down to where I was, but I was starting to really lose it at this point. I remember marching to stay focused, and yelling out the address numbers as if something else entirely took over my body to tell her these things. 


This is where it really starts to fall apart, and it still feels like it is. I still feel like I'm falling. I remember slipping face forward into a ditch near a cement culvert, but it felt like one of those dreams where you miss a step in the stair or fall back into your body super quick, like a jolt. This kept happening for a bit. I kept slipping, as if every dream I ever had where I jolted back in my body was replaying in my head. Then there was a sudden slow pain, as if all my teeth were being ripped from my skull. The same pain kept repeating, over and over. As if grass was being ripped from the earth over and over, or that I was grass bursting through the earth over and over. This pulling ripping pain was accompanied by a light, followed by a dark nothingness. I kept thinking kinda these pretentious and profound thoughts like, this is how the universe was born, this is my punishment for not believing god. This intense pain and light that kept coming back. It started to decompress, like come apart. I could feel the pain become more nuanced and whatever pleasure I was feeling also became more detailed. Like all the good and bad things were happening in my life all at once, but it was also occurring in a singular line too. I would remember really bad experiences happening and think, it gets worse, it gets so much worse, or that when good experiences happen they get better and better. But as the good things got better and the bad things got worse, I caught the pattern and the pattern in of itself was also simultaneously pure joy and pure pain. 


At this point, my friends are pulling me out of the ditch, but it keeps happening over and over again. They pull me up, they pull me up again and again, and finally I feel like I'm coming back to reality somewhat. They're frantic of course and take me inside, but I feel each traumatic reaction I experience starts the whole pain/joy cycle again but I kept thinking one of my friends were going to rape me or that the two of them were going to kill me. Staring at a singular thing helped me focus and stay out of the loop. I would also go into these dark places full of color that were soothing, like anxious ticks I had as a child that I do not remember. 


My friends were frantic, wondering what to do in the situation as they were explaining to me what happened. It was still hard to understand though. Cops came and I wondered why wasn't an ambulance sent, I'm dying, I feel like I'm dying. The ambulance didn't come until the cops called them. They took me in the ambulance and hooked me up to machines where my heart rate is up to 140. I remember seeing bits of grass on my arm that reminded me of that growing grass feeling, pain and joy. The lady helping me in the ambulance kept changing. She was a bigger brunette lady, but my mind kept making her look like Rebel Wilson, and I realized, this is another part of my punishment, another part of the cycle. And she knew and strapped me down and winked at me like this is the point you realize that you're about to experience all the sexually depraved things you've ever thought about, get ready.


After going through that cycle again, I start to get back into my body, but it hurts all over. The ambulance lady asks me for a pain number and I said 10. My head wasn't connecting with my body, there are things I was thinking and wanting to say but I couldn't. When I moved my arms it felt like I was moving them through dirt and bones. I was so cold and only got colder. I remember them wheeling me into the emergency room lobby but I hated being there, I hated being so exposed, I thought they may had brought me into a jail. The nurses were extremely rude to me. I couldn't get my body up to go and give a urine sample so I had to get a catheter. It was extremely painful and they had to hold me down. At one point I thought I was giving birth and I had just been in a coma the whole time I was pregnant, or that I didn't know I was pregnant. I was in so much pain I grabbed one of the nurses and I guess dug my nails into her. I remember her hitting me and chastising me. After this they leave me with my pants off (i'm still wearing the shit I rolled around in a ditch in) and a doctor comes and checks me to make sure I don't have any brain or nerve damage. I'm able to respond to all of his orders perfectly and I'm even able to follow the light with my eyes. 


After this I guess I'm just dozing in the er, a few other doctors come and see me, one of their billing people comes and see me before I'm even lucid and I feel like I hear my family outside or my bosses, but no one was there except one of my friends. He stays with me and I still feel woozy but I supposed it was coming down now. I really want to go home at this point because I feel embarrassed and stupid. After what feels like another hour, I get discharged with a paper about substance abuse. 


I've been home for about 12 hours now and I still feel very spacey. Like when I look at certain things, they remind me of part of the pain/pleasure cycle I went through and it scares me into thinking I'm still caught up in it and it won't get better. I'm angry that I was treated so poorly at the hospital, I'm sad that I put my friends in such a horrible position, I'm embarrassed because this all happened outside my front door. 


I'm having a hard time feeling normal, and I just wanted to ask anyone if they've felt the same? I have a hard time not just staring off into space thinking about everything that happened. Is it just the THC that caused this, can it cause something like this at high enough levels, or did it trigger something inside of me? I still feel wrong and crazy and I don't know what to do because doctors didn't tell me anything or refer me to any kind of psychiatric help. I was ignored and when I was lucid enough to explain anything they were discharging me. I felt like people kept looking at me and wanting me to leave instead of actually helping me, but this may have just been part of the bad trip. I don't know because no on cared enough to help me or explain to me what I had just went through.


TL;DR
I had a bad reaction after taking a hit of THC. Could it be that I'm just not used to taking such a high level of it, or did it trigger some underlying mental illness in me?


I'm sorry if this post has any errors, it's really hard for me to read and read over it without feeling all of it again. I appreciate any advice or any resources anyone can help me with if it seems like any mental illness and not just drug related. I'm in the United States.",23Aug2019,4

107,"So I tried scheduling an appointment but they said they don’t except cash only insurance which I don’t have because my mom told me to not get it at my job. I’m just worried that my problems will get worse.

How do I schedule an appointment to a Psychiatrist without insurance?",23Aug2019,1
108,"I think some habits of mine are not normal, like I can pick the skin around my fingers for hours, daily. It's been going on for a few years (say about 2) and on &amp; off for many years before that in my life. I don't exactly remember about it from when I was young. I think a trigger might be, how I worry about anything and everything.

 Two years ago, I got into grad school (masters), and the stressful, competitive environment here has done nothing but added fuel to my already anxious, overthinking  personality. And most recently, I've been thinking a lot about grad admissions (phd) and so this bad habit has worsened a lot more, hence I felt the need to come here and accept that something has to change. 

I've also been reflecting a lot on my past mistakes (in the past 2 years) like why I haven't ever performer academically as much as I've wanted to) could do and what exactly went wrong and I've concluded that even though I was serious about my studies, I've wasted hours, sometimes days, when some little thing worried me a lot, and made me so anxious that I found it difficult to focus on my studies. And of course, I don't want it to happen again, ever. I am now beginning to realise that I might need some kind of help, but I don't know to ask how. 

My current uni doesn't have very active mental health/ counselling services (if they exist) and in the past, I've tried going to visit a psychiatrist twice but they've always been dismissive of me, saying things like, 'You're too young to have anxiety problems, after all, if you have good food and some money, you don't have a thing to worry about (other ambitions can go to hell)"". And that's why I am quite hesitant to go meet another professional. It takes a lot to bare your problems to a stranger and it doesn't feel good when they're this ignorant. 

I'm sorry if this was somewhat incoherent, I usually get like this when I'm feeling helpless and don't have anyone to share it to. I just don't want my past to cripple my future too. I can do hard work to make my career but I am sometimes unable to control where my thoughts drift off to.

But after that I also stopped talking with my parents. They live in another country and we would talk *roughly* once a week, though sometimes weeks would go by without us talking. But now I haven't spoken with them since June 2018. Note, I didn't stop talking with them because of a fight, or some mental trauma, or any other reason. Once day we talked and the next I just decided I didn't need that anymore. And we are otherwise on perfectly fine terms with no drama.

When I stopped talking with those friends, I felt a bit of a pang of loss. It's still there but I'm okay with it. When I stopped talking with my parents I felt, continue to feel, nothing at all. They try to reach me by phone or email once a week but I feel no desire to check their messages or respond.

I am also feeling a desire to just pull away even more from everyone that remains in my life.

So here's the thing. Am I depressed or something? I imagine someone who is depressed, who is disconnecting from others, would be feeling something. Sadness. But I'm generally not. So I'm not sure if I should be talking to someone or getting help. I don't have any childhood or even more recent traumas, mental or otherwise. Life hasn't been easy but it hasn't been bad. I'm not consumed with rage. I feel like I'm pretty average. 

An outside perspective on this would be welcome.",23Aug2019,1

120,"So ive been diagnosed with major depression for a while now and i really dont have enjoyment or anything when it even comes to hobbies. Like when i was younger my go to were card games and video games. And now those dont really interest me at all, im fairly certain that may be depression.

BUT the main reason for this post is ive noticed that not only do i find it hard to enjoy things but i also put down hobbies and kind of Express that im better than doing them. Like for instance ive played card games my whole life and i think ive hurt peoples feelings unintentionally by saying hearthstone isnt very difficult at all and anybody can do well with it. Then they asked me ""then why haven't you done it?"" And my response was basicially ""because i dont find it enjoyable or challenging"" which both i actually believe if that matters.

So im wondering if me devaluing things like above is part of depression or of thats just a flaw in my personality that i need to find a way to fix. Because i dont feel this way about everything in life, particularly things like sports i think those take skill to compete in its honestly mostly for video games and card games that i feel like people over exaggerate how much skill is needed to excel in them(it honestly seems like people believe being good at a childrens card game is some extraordinary feat that only a select few ""elite"" human beings can do and the people who put in the time should be revered for whatever reason).

I recently released a new music video called [""Dear Doctor""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRf0uSJIWY8) and would love to hear  your thoughts! You can view/listen to here: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRf0uSJIWY8

More information in press release below:

“Doctor, I don’t need another pill,

I just need someone who can listen to me…”

(Burlington, ON) – Following up on his recent single, “Opioid Crisis,” Toronto-born hip hop emcee/rapper and Registered Psychotherapist MC FÜBB (pronounced “emcee foob”; aka Daniel Farb) has released a new song and accompanying music video: “Dear Doctor.” Speaking from the perspective of being both a past consumer and a current provider of mental health services, “Dear Doctor” is a response to the legacy of over-medicalized, disease-focused treatment in psychiatry’s history, and a call for greater humanism and person-centeredness in the world of mental healthcare.

Performed over a boom-bap instrumental by producer and beat-maker Execute, “Dear Doctor” explores themes of being pigeon-holed by diagnostic categories; the often overlooked impact of the social determinants of mental health; and pleads with those in the helping professions to “be real” and authentic in their interactions with their patients/clients.

“Dear Doctor” is the second single to be release from MC FÜBB’s forthcoming EP, Wounded Healer (a project for which the artist received a recording grant from the Ontario Arts Council), which is scheduled to be released in the fall of 2019.

“Dear Doctor” can be viewed at the following link: https://youtu.be/WRf0uSJIWY8

124,"sorry for confusing post, im just really confused myself. for reference, im diagnosed with major depressive disorder, ocd, and anxiety. i have a history of self harm and suicidal tendencies. trigger warning for all of those.

ive always been an introvert. i loved being alone and sometimes around a friend or two, but i needed to recharge very often. being alone was never an issue.

for some reason, the last few weeks ive needed to be with my only close friend or my mom. whenever theyre even in a different room i get incredibly depressed and relapse into self harm and suicidal thoughts. when im with them, for the most part, im fine. its incredibly strange and my only theory is that i started prozac a month or so ago, but i cant really imagine how that leads to me not wanting to be alone? the only other effects ive noticed of it is more energy and better sleep, which is obviously good.

what do i do? i dont want to constantly be with someone (well i mean i do, but i dont want to ask that of them, thats be outrageous and selfish), but i also feel like much more of this and it could escalate. any little thing makes me consider suicide, and i dont know what i should do.",23Aug2019,1

Today I woke up, late morning, feeling well rested, made lunch for B and I to share and we were both super happy. I walked with him back towards work and split off to run an errand. And I made a start on my list. I did everything else before phonecalls, I left those till last. I found out I could email or fill out forms for most things. I just had to make one call. And of course my anxiety kicks in and I start to panic. It's just one call, nothing major, it won't take long, etc. But the call took 15+ minutes and it was personal questions. They asked about mental health issues. And unfortunately talking about them to a stranger, dragged them out into the open. And since that moment my mood has tanked. I started feeling low. I managed to hide it okay Infront of my son. I snapped at him a couple of times but I managed to control it mostly. 

But once he went to bed it was a different matter. The mask dropped and the facade ended. I felt safe to be myself with B, he always makes me feel safe. Unfortunately the voices took over and made themselves known. She snapped at B and started an argument about something completely stupid and anxiety took over as I tried to explain the reasoning behind it. He told me to take my mood elsewhere. It's only now I realised what happened. I feel awful I just wanna crawl into a hole and never come out. 

I feel like I'm slowly being suffocated by a dark cloud. It just looms ever closer making it hard to think, feel or breathe. I feel so sad and lonely, so depressed, angry, tired, physically and mentally exhausted.

Now I don’t ever cry over movies, like I teared up from “The hate u give” but that’s about it. I haven’t cried in months and I usually never cry, but i feel like crying all the time.

129,"Hi everyone!

I've been following this sub for a really long time and y'all motivate me to keep going, especially when days get rough. I've been in recovery for depression/anxiety/ADHD for almost a year now and since getting formally diagnosed and FINALLY finding meds that work for me, I've been able to actually WORK on myself and face my demons.

Since October of last year I've been working on a planner designed specifically to help people who struggle with mental health. I plan to eventually do a kickstarter and try to get it produced, but for now I want to have a (second) beta test of the planner. Your participation is ENTIRELY free. I just ask that you try to stay as committed to using the planner for the month of the test as you can and ideally I would like to set up a call so we can talk about goals and such. I will also include an optional mindfulness plan to help you get grounded and start to build coping mechanisms and a budgeting sheet for the month.

If you are interested, shoot me a message and I will send you more information.

131,"So here's some background info about me. I'm 20 years old and in college and since I was 13 I have always felt ugly. In high school I was asked out by guys and I didn't like them back, so I never had a boyfriend in high school and because of that I always felt ugly. So last November, I got my first boyfriend and he dumped me in February, he felt like we had none in common and wasn't supportive of me studying cyber security at school. He was very old fashioned. Most people would say that I'm pretty outgoing, so I can meet guys quite easily. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before I started college and I take Lexapro 15 mg for it. 

College has not been nice to my self esteem. I go to a mainly white school and most of the girls look like what I always wanted to look like. They're thin, blue eyes, blonde hair. I'm white, its just that I can actually pass for Hispanic or Latina so people confuse on what I actually am. To be more specific I'm Italian.  I'm working on losing weight and since I've been home for the summer I lost 7 pounds. Its been slow but once I'm back on campus I plan to hit the gym again. I've been studying for certifications so going to the gym hasn't been top priority. I try to find other ways to get my exercise. 

Lately, its been difficult handling my insecurities.  I always feel ugly and even if I feel good there will always be something to make me feel bad. Instagram has been so bad for my self esteem. I go on it less because I hate seeing girls on Instagram who literally get thousands of followers and hundreds of likes because of their looks. Here is my Instagram if you're curious how I look like: danyixa. I understand I have 3.1k followers on here but these girls literally are what I really always wanted to look like.

Anyways, that's not important. lets get to the point. I have been considering plastic surgery. I don't have the money for it but everyday I have the urge to seek the surgery. I haven't yet because I  know my parents wouldn't approve and my doctor probably wont allow me. I want bigger lips, bigger butt and higher cheek bones. My insecurities have gotten so bad that I lose motivation to do anything, I literally can't get myself to study or do anything important because I ruminate so much on how I look. I've been in therapy. Its helped with my anxiety and depression. But my self image is still an issue for me.

I've started getting panic attacks again, whenever a man doesn't like me, or goes cold on me for someone else, or just ghosts me.

138,"Hi reddit. I have lots to cover but I will try to make it quick. I’m a 21 year old male US engineering student. I just moved in on campus and I really like my room. That being said, I think I’m ready to confront some fundamental problems in my life and if any of you have some advice I’d be happy to hear it. Okay here goes.

I’m bad at social situations. I wouldn’t call it anxiety; I don’t get nervous, but when people put me on the spot and demand instant charisma and finesse with no hesitation or prior consideration, I tend to underperform. I don’t say anything mean or insensitive, in fact quite the opposite is true. I don’t ever put my foot down and assert myself. I never seem to have anything interesting to say. Because of this, people seem to get bored and walk away. I’ve lost most of the people I would call friends because they eventually seem to get sick of me. It’s become very lonely, where I only talk to people in a very superficial way, how’s the weather treating you, yada yada yada. I don’t go to parties or anything; the chaos is too much and like I said, under pressure I tend to underperform socially. I cannot wave a magic wand and become more charismatic, but I can ask, what can I do to outwardly appear more interesting?

tl;dr How do I, an otherwise average college student, stand out in a positive way that’s gonna help me find a place here? I’m not super charismatic but I do struggle with loneliness. Any suggestions?",23Aug2019,1
139,"TL;DR: I am obsessive and paranoid to the point where it's hard to do most things without ""overdoing"", or interact with people, meet new people and maintain the relationship, or do or get anything from a person without straining or pushing them.

Like I said in the post. It seems I can't do most things without causing some sort of strain on other people.

I obsess and obsess and give in to my paranoia and I don't know how to stop. I've tried, hard, and I can't seem to stop it or keep it together without following my obsessions and paranoia (I have severe OCD and my therapist says it's the main culprit). It ruins my interactions with people. I ask so many questions and make people repeat things to me over and over until I feel safe, or until my brain can rest. And I probably seem like such a nuisance, just this obsessed, paranoid little person, like a fly that won't stop buzzing around people's heads.

I hate it and I hate myself for it.

It can be big things, or it can be small things.

Like today, well, for the past days, I've been obsessed with getting a tint on my prescription glasses. Small thing. I got a tint I was happy with and the tint was nice, then I needed to change my prescription, I said ""maybe a little darker"" *mistake*. So they got it too dark, too much color. So I asked if they could lighten it, then it was too light, I spent a day with it, then went back to change it *mistake*, and they got it too dark, so I asked for a lighter tint and for some reason it came out dark like sunglasses. They then said it cannot be changed anymore. So I'm buying new lenses with no tint, clear, I should've just done that in the first place and I wouldn't have bothered them so much. But I did. And they probably think I'm just this annoying piece of shit.

So there's that.

And then there's stuff like constantly asking, calling, and confirming things with my bank, social security, friends, family, other things. And it's always about stupid stuff that should be obvious or left alone. I'm just that guy saying, 
""ok, hey! Sorry I just wanted to make sure *blah blah blah blah*""
Or ""hey sorry I'm calling again, did you say *blah*? or *blah*? I thought you might've meant *blah* but I'm just checking""
Or calling my friends and family saying stuff like ""hey I didn't offend you did I?"" ""Are you sure? I just dont want you to be *blah*""
Or ""ok tell me the honest truth""
Or ""are you *blah*ing? Would you ever do that? I just want to know, would you ever *blah*?''
And other stupid stuff. And by the end, people are so tired and repelled by me. I ruin it.

Some people have patience and they somehow still like me. My family can't stand me sometimes but they're my family and they don't push me out. My best friends are somehow still my best friends, and that's awesome, but I think it takes a special kind of person.
And I can tell my roommates are so tired of me, they avoid me and don't talk to me unless it's a ""hi"" or something they NEED to tell me.

And also I'm way too annoyingly polite
And I always think people are either lying to me, hiding things from me, being fake, secretly talking about me, or plotting against me. I also constantly think people are watching me or listening to me, and I haven't had a chance to go deeper into that with my therapist because there are other big problems we're working on, but it's becoming a huge problem.
And I get so nervous and scared to see people that I avoid it, or force myself to basically shut off my reasoning and logic, because my reasoning and logic is horrible and overactive to the point where it's never correct.

142,"I’ve tried everything else. I’ve asked every family member that I know, none of them had room for me. I don’t have any friends to move in with either. I’ve applied for countless places but none of them accepted my application or called me back or returned my emails. I even tried dating one of my mom’s old friends but she never accepted any of my friend requests on FaceBook nor did she ever respond to any of my messages. I even tried to get my aunt to ruin her for me but nothing came from that either. I tried asking them for a moped but they wouldn’t let me have one. I tried getting into this apartment place at this mental health center but they rejected my application because of what my grandmother told them. I also tried calling several homeless shelters and halfway houses and all of them either had no room for me as they were currently filled or they didn’t answer my call or something was wrong with the number (ie they were out of service). I feel like I have no hope at this point. And I tried calling IMPACT America twice and they weren’t able to take my call and took me straight to the voicemail. Jesus fucking Christ man. Is there anything that won’t go wrong at this point? I called the suicide prevention lifeline again and they told me to call up my social security office about my mom leeching off my SSI, so I did but they only took me to some robocall answering service giving me a list of options that were unrelated to what I was looking for. I then decided to go to their website and filed a report for fraud against my mother and I’m also about to call up medicaid on Monday to find a new counselor because I never see her hardly nor do they ever answer their phonecalls or voice messages. I don’t want to be here for one more day and if this SSI shit goes south, I’m walking away without saying a word. There is nothing anybody can do to help me, I’m on my own.",23Aug2019,2
143,"I’ve had multiple clairvoyant experiences that were induced by marijuana where the following occurred: 

Normal existing as a person is like sitting in the drivers seat of a car. The driver (the observing presence which you are) controls the car (your body). What I experienced was being a passenger in the car, observing what I, as the driver, was doing. Basically, I had to experience over a year of my life as the passenger with all sensory experiences and the ability to hear my own thoughts. Eventually this experience came to an end, and I woke up back in my body at the time and place where the experience began, this time as the driver again. I created memories while being the passenger, seeing what I would eventually experience as the driver. So now that I’m the driver, I constantly have things that are like deja vus but they’re different because I can remember “experiencing” them multiple times in the past during these clairvoyant experiences. No matter what I “choose” to do with my “free will”, recognition that this event is one of the millions of things that I experienced during the clairvoyant experience. 

This is driving me crazy because I can’t do anything to stop it or calm it down. I feel like a robot with scripted actions and that everything is predetermined. This lack of perceived control is causing anger and anxiety with no where to put it. I can’t enjoy anything in life anymore because it feels like the 3rd, 4th, or 5th time I’ve had to experience it. 

What the can I do?",23Aug2019,0

145,"A while back r/mentalhealth member stated how Avengers Endgame and then death of Tony Stark impacted their mental health. I was absolutely gutted to learn this as I wasn’t fortunate enough to see the film in cinemas and despite trying to avoid spoilers at all costs, this unlikely source spoilt for me... or so I thought. Tonight, upon dvd release I finally watched endgame and I thought it was very apt. Yes it’s sad but as most will understand if your in this subreddit, it’s life. Personally I thought it was the right way to sign off.",23Aug2019,2
146,"I am currently in a long distance relationship with a man I really love and see a future with.
Next year we are planning to live together and whenever we spent time, there really is a great harmony between us.

However, everytime we seperate again I simply break down.
I cry. I miss him and my whole day solely serves as a distraction for me from this whole situation.
My insecurities peak and I am nervous almost 24/6. 

Being alone again basically triggers my anxiety in a really really bad way.
I know the reasons why, but I feel like I can't ever find a solution.

I tried working on myself. Meditation. Sports. Hobbies. More talking on the phone with him. Less talking on the phone with him.

I am at a point where I feel like I will never be able to handle myself without a partner by my side and I am just fucking frustrated at this point...",23Aug2019,1
147,"Hi, I'm at the end of my tether. Not sure what to do. My wife is mentally ill, not sure what is wrong, she has been on sertraline for a while and the highest dosage. But I don't think it's the right drug. She is very paranoid. She thinks that I go around and tell the neighboorood to say thing to her. It has recently got a lot worse, we got kicked out of a hotel cos she woke up at 2am and started having a go at the staff and fellow guests, saying they were all in on it. I cannot take her anywhere without her thinking I have told everyone to say certain trigger words to her (which are very common words). I have spoken to crises team, but they seem useless, what can I do, its making me question my sanity",23Aug2019,1
149,"I am currently in somewhat deep debt. Almost 10,000 dirhams or $3,500 and been jobless for months now. I had a job interview earlier but if I fail this one I think I might lose it. I’m really thinking about ending it and I don’t want to cause any trouble for my family here because it’s punishable by law if you commit suicide in this country. But I think I found a loophole. If I killed myself somewhere far for my family I think they’ll be off the hook. Do anyone know if I suffocate myself with plastic bag over my head would take long and would it hurt bad? 25 years is long enough and I’m tired of being a fuck up.",23Aug2019,1
