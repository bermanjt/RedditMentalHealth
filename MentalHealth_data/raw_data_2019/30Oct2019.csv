0,Hi! So I learned about mindfulness in high school and it was brought up again in a social work panel I went to for school and they mentioned how important it was working in that field and that it’s a good idea to get into the habit now. Does anyone know of any apps that can help?,30Oct2019,2
1,"Sorry for the lack of karma, this is a new account made in order to keep myself anonymous, my last post was found by a person at my school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel depressed today. The reason being is that I may have found what I don't want to do with my life. I'm in school to be an engineer, yet I feel like this path is not working for me, and this is the only my first semester. I feel like im in a prison that i'm told will ""benefit"" me, but I feel like is hurting me mentally.

I'm currently at an Engineering University to be a Computer Engineer and, at the moment. I'm not sure I want to be. I feel like I'm slowly loosing interest in what I want to do with the rest of my life and am just stuck in a hard place in my life in which and I don't know what to do. I'm not doing to well in some classes and have some mildly-serious mental health problems that I have to wait more than two weeks to get into the school psychology center for and for that reason, I've thought a lot about leaving the school for good. There is rarely a day in which I feel like I'm doing what I want to do with the rest of my life. I feel like my parents, including my engineering Professor Dad, have thrust me into this career path because they think its the best for me. I just want to have the control in my life to go my own road and do what I want for the rest of my life, yet I also think that staying here would be a good option too because of ""opportunities"" Id get. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I know some of you will go on your keyboards calling me a whinny little bitch who doesn't appreciate what his mommy and daddy spoiled we with, and that is not the case. I very much appreciate what my parents did for me and I want to make them proud, but I'm just not sure how I can do that at the moment. Should I leave this school and go my own way and be who I want to be, or do I Just suffer through this and hope something good comes from it?",30Oct2019,1

3,"I go through pretty radical shifts in my state of mind over the course of a day, it’s sorta manic and depressive. In the depressive part I think all these terrible things about myself, and it seems super clear to me that I’m fundamentally broken in some way. I don’t talk to anyone or really do much, I make these pathetic posts or the social skills subreddit about solving problems that I don’t have,  I find myself super unattractive physically socially intellectually etc etc. Then it all flips and I’m in a positive state of mind, now this doesn’t mean I think everything is awesome, but I generally hold myself in high regard, and think that all believe I can fairly easily solve any problems that I do have with a little time and a little effort. In either state of mind I feel completely convinced that what I’m feeling at that time is the true state of things. The effect on my actions is pretty profound to. If I show up to a party or event in a happy period I’ll joke and have fun with everyone, if not I’ll sit in a corner silently. This rollercoaster and exhausting and I don’t really know how to deal with it.",30Oct2019,5

Hello. I am concerned about my friend (who is seeing a therapist by the way) because of how bad the extent of his mental health is, and how it impacts pretty much everyone around him.

He definitely has anxiety and depression along with anger issues which can be attributed to both. He is dependent on this friend of is from across the country to talk about his depression, but then expects so much from this person that she had to take a break. I will try my best to list as many things as I can on this post.

This friend of his is a girl who lives in California, we live in New Jersey. They met up once over the summer. My friend and I met her on a Minecraft Realm, and we are all friends. I will give this girl the name Jill, and my friend the name Albert.

List of people to know:

Albert - My friend

Jill - Our friend/Albert's crush

Bob - Bully

Insecurity: Albert is RELIANT on Jill for emotional support. He never talks to anybody else about his issues. It took a suicide attempt a few months ago for anybody besides Jill to know he even HAD depression. Albert likes Jill, but Jill only sees Albert as a close friend. Despite this, Albert pursues a relationship with her in the future, and also has extremely high expectations for her. Jill once made an unrealistic promise to Albert about how she would always be there for him, but recently, she needed a break from Albert, as Albert would fight her (over things that I will mention later), causing a detriment to Jill's grades. During that break, Albert would repeatedly message me during school saying, things along the lines of ""I think Jill wants to leave me"" and whatnot, and I had to keep telling him that she only needed a break because of how much he fighted her. Then, she came back anyways, which basically proved his insecurities wrong.

His insecurity is not limited to Jill, but also to his suicide attempt, which I do not really blame him for, but more the way he deals with people he does not want knowing about it. Some of the kids who bullied him found out due to me mistakenly telling Albert's friend. Albert's friend told one of the bullies. Due to that, Albert is somewhat frustrated at me, but REFUSES to forgive his old friend, and this has been months. Any time I even mention his name, Albert gets mad at me for doing so.

When he was in regular contact with these bullies, the worst they did in his opinion was start talking to Jill. Albert himself has claimed that he does not care that they used to put him in a headlock, or call him names. He just won't shut up about how they talked to Jill, and how that made it feel like they were taking her from him. To this day, almost four months since he last went to school with them, he legitimately wants to kill these bullies, and again, for the horrendous crime, of talking to Jill.

He often messages me saying that if he had died in his suicide attempt, Jill would still be friends with one of the bullies, and I keep telling him that if she does, it's because that bully may have been bad to him, but he helped Jill out a lot once, and because talking to other people isn't actual harassment.

High expectations of Jill: The fights with Jill largely stem from her still talking to one bully, same one from the final paragraph of the Insecurity part. He first wanted her to admit that the bully (we'll call him Bob) is a bad person. When she does admit that, he wants MORE from her, wanting her to stop talking to him completely. I believe that he sees Bob as direct competition to get Jill, and it is extremely hard for me to get him to leave it without being rude. When Jill went on her break, he kept messaging me over and over saying that she broke her promise of being there for him forever. When Jill made a small joke about his mic quality when we were playing a video game, and posted it on a chat with other friends, he ended up leaving the chat without explanation for hours, then got mad when he returned and saw that both Jill and I were mad at him about it. He expects Jill to be a saint who will be there for him 24/7, and whenever she does make a stupid decision, and I call her ""stupid"", he replies with something like, ""Don't you dare call her that.""

Not being able to forgive: I already said in the Insecurity section about his friend who told the bullies. Well, that friend was 60 pounds lighter, and far weaker than any of those bullies, and told him that as an error thinking it would be better. Albert REFUSES to forgive even that mistake. Then there are other things, like how I stated he wants to literally kill the two other bullies for ""mentally torturing"" him. Hell, if he sees this post on my Reddit, he's probably going to get mad at me about it. I keep telling him to just forgive and forget, and he always responds with some stupid reason to not forgive them because of how they keep talking to Jill. He brings up how Bob put him into a headlock once, but he stated himself that it is only an excuse to get him back for talking to Jill. I tell Albert to not let spite control him, but he doesn't listen.

Anxiety and trauma: When I tell him to start working out, he refuses to do it because he has ""trauma"" due to how his father made him bike extremely hard at night which made him sore. When I tell him to take another SAT to improve his score, he says he doesn't want to go through the anxiety of preparing for it again. Not much else I can say about this, as I did not try to say my own things about this.

History: He says that his father was abusive to both him and his mother in the past. Since his suicide attempt, he has not done much else. Whenever I do go to his house, I look for any opportunity to just mess with his father (tell me if this is wrong). Due to bad fathering, I feel as though he is in a way ""feminine"" in his mindset, with the way he gets hurt by people so easily for small jokes, and hates the phrase ""man up"". Him and Jill try to get me to talk about my own problems because Jill always calls it ""toxic masculinity"" and whatnot, and he tends to agree. He states that his suicide attempt was caused because he had to bottle everything in.

Before his suicide attempt, Jill was introduced to Bob and the other bully. She did end up talking to him less, and he had nobody else to talk to about his thoughts. Only recently has he actually started kind of talking to me, but as shown throughout this post, I'm not the calming presence of Jill, I'm a far more aggressive presence. He is currently with a therapist who comes once a week, and does take medications, though he says his depression is not getting better unless he talks to Jill.

In case this information is important, he is agnostic. Does not believe in heaven or hell, thus no real incentive to not kill himself besides Jill.

My questions:

How do I get him to be less dependent on Jill?

How do I get him to forgive or at least forget the bullies and that other poor friend who made a mistake?

How do I make him not be as easily hurt by small jokes?

How do I make him take personal responsibility for the bad things he has done like how he previously treated Jill?

I may have more questions in the future. If you are a psychiatrist, and know how to deal with this situation, either comments or private messages will be GREATLY appreciated.",30Oct2019,2
5,"In this post, I'm going to change my approach and stop describing myself as ugly, unintelligent, worthless, useless, boring, etc. 

If I'm honest I have average to slightly below average looks, average height, average body, above average intelligence, above average moral fiber. Everything's average. Ever notice how when you use the same word too many times it ceases to look like a real word? Average. 

I do have depression and I'm on medication for it. 

Why is it that if I make an error in judgment, I immediately conclude that my judgment is terrible? 

Just because I'm average-looking, why do I call myself ugly? 

Just because I'm not a genius, why do I say that I'm stupid? 

When I slack, why does that mean I am completely devoid of discipline?

In short, why do I magnify my flaws? Why can't I ever give myself credit for what I do well? 

**Why doesn't an** ***intellectual*** **understanding that I am basically decent translate to a proportionally decent amount of self-esteem?**

Is this a symptom of not-completely-under-control depression? Is it possible that I'm on a dosage that's strong enough to quell the suicidal thoughts, but too weak to dispel the feelings of worthlessness? We are talking about 5mg abilify daily. 

If there is a better sub for this question, let me know. I appreciate your comments and questions.",30Oct2019,13

12,"Stop talking about always feeling sad and figure it out.  Telling yourself you feel sad will only lead to feeling sad. If you feel negative emotions approaching, distract your mind immediately. Song a song, call someone, watch a YouTube video. The emotion will pass and you will be able to face it with more rationality. Rant oncoming beware. I'm so fucking sick of the attitude of the current generation which I am part of (I’m 24).  This type of generation has always made the following one's life miserable. E.g -World war 1?( hard times) was followed by the roaring 20’s ( soft times. Me myself and I generation following a generation that defeated a huge obstacle to change the way society would continue afterward)which was followed by the great depression that culminated with the arguably most dynamic future defying event depending on the winner in the history of the free world. WW2.  

The soft attitudes of the 20’s we forced to change during the depression, that they caused.  The result of the attitude change is the only reason we won ww2. Our societal attitude was so hardened from scraping our way through the 30’s, that nothing was too big to overcome. Team work and self sacrifice was the only way people made it through the depression and the only reason we defeated hitler. Imagine our society now, focused on the things we take offense to every day, the meaningless shit, in the face of a complete fucking psychopath leading a global power trying to redifine the way we live. 

We would all aruge about the best way to approach it and by the time a decision was made, the stars on our flag would have been replaced by a swastika. The Great Depression generation knew that they needed to put all personal opinions to the side and think as a group. Nobody talked about left , right , politically correct, morals, etc. they thought about the productive actions they needed to take in order to keep society happy and improving. 

Shut the fuck up. Nobody honestly cares what you complain about. They really don’t. If they act like they do , they do so because  for their own mental wellbeing.  If you don’t like something take action. Don’t talk about it.",30Oct2019,4
13,"I think I just had my first psychosis/panic attack, I don’t know what it was. 

I guess I’m posting this for a cry for help and someone to talk to anonymously as I’m overwhelmed and scared and do t want to see anyone. 

I was walking home from my ex’s, I went to pick up some stuff. He did some bad shit to me that’s traumatised me, changed my way of thinking mentally and made me flinchy and paranoid and made my current mental health problems a lot worse.
. 

While I was walking I was overthinking about everything that just happened, but simple stuff like for example, we were laughing and properly talking for the first time in weeks and suddenly he went quiet and wasn’t laughing or responding to my reactions or not answering or listening to me 3 or 4 times when I asked a question, just little things like that has triggered because I’m scared that I’ve offended him or he doesn’t want me there. I even think about that he’s just depressed suddenly because he might miss our relationship and I don’t want to get back with him and offend him, or that he literally just took his meds and he’s getting sleepy.

It then lead to where all I could hear was this high pitched sound, a lot louder than my tinnitus that sometimes happens, it got louder and louder. It got that bad where I started crying because my chest was hurting and my brain was so over thought with things, I ended up talking to myself trying to convince that I’m just over thinking and I was telling myself how good I am as a person (I am a nice guy, nothing special, but I do put myself first in front of everyone, but I’d never do anything to intentionally hurt or offend someone, that’s my worst fear haha so I just shut myself off because it stops me from over thinking more than I already do) 

I was even talking to god who I don’t even believe in and I still don’t, I was just begging him for to change me as a person because I don’t want to get better as it won’t be worth it. I truly think that if I put myself out there and get a life, life will be harder because that’s more overthinking and more things I have to do to live a normal life, like working and friends.. (even family, which sounds harsh because I love them so fucking much) I ended up doing the stereotypical stuff like smacking myself on the head to distract myself even more from those thoughts. 

I’m 23, have Asperger’s syndrome which is on the autistic spectrum but I’m living in my prime, I should be going out and exploring the world and having fun.. even meeting someone again to date and not off dating which I’ve had bad experiences out of the 3 people I’ve met on there. I used to be out going and had a lot of friends, although not the most loyal haha. 

I’ve never done anything like this before, so please if you see anyone do something like this, instead of being scared of them and walking off, try and calm them down or something. If you think they’re dangerous, at least you can outrun them because they aren’t in the state of mind to chase you. I think if someone talked to me and tried to distract me from my thoughts instead of making me more paranoid, I would of been fine. Now I’m at home shaking and I don’t even know if this makes sense, because I don’t feel like reading it back, but please.. just be nice and help people more. We live in the generation where mental health is getting more serious I think as time gets on and I believe it gets passed on to generation to generation. Social media and the internet is more toxic than ever, people don’t even have their own beliefs anymore as they just mostly follow what happens on the news or follows what most people say is right because they think the majority thinks the “correct way”. 

When I try to talk to someone about all this stuff I’m talking about now, even my family, they just tell me I’m wrong (but in a nice way, I guess) and that I’m just overthinking and going crazy from isolating myself.. but I’ve always felt this way about the world, but it’s gotten a lot stronger for the last 4-5 years)

I don’t even know what this post is meant to contribute or be, but I’d like to know if I anyone else thinks this way. Should I get help? And how the hell do I make myself get help if I don’t have the motivation or want to get better sometimes? I’m so stuck now.",30Oct2019,2

You know how people say they don't feel comfortable in their own skin/body, as they think it is ugly? Well, I feel the same way, but literally. I think I am attractive for who I am, for the most part. My biggest issue is my body itself....(???) I am sorry this is hard to explain. When I think about my naked body or look down at it, I immediately get nauseous. The skin, the flesh underneath, the bones, the blood, and most importantly, the internal organs, what makes up my body makes me immediately want to throw up. I want to get rid of my organs just magically and automatically so badly and I don't know why. The only internal organ I am comfortable with that I can name is the brain (including IRL gore), but even the mention of any other organs makes me nauseous, even the word itself. I just want to leave my body.

17,"So, I am having a terrible family crisis that caused me to call up my old therapist to try and resume therapy. I started crying when she answered the phone and I feel like she only focused on setting up a meeting soon but didn't ask me what was going on in that moment of grief. I felt this especially sucked because we won't be able to meet for a few days.

 I realize they need to have boundaries for themselves and can't deal with patients crying to them on the phone outside of an appointment but it was during business hours and she did say she was available on the phone during that half hour. I feel that she could have at least said something comforting even if it was quick.

Part of the reason I stopped therapy is because I always felt that she was always exactly on time with ending our meetings and sometimes I just didn't feel she understood me. She also generally was not talkative enough for me and I sometimes felt that I had to run the session and decide what to talk about when I think I need someone to push me a little more.

She is a nice lady though and she did remember names of people I mentioned etc and she did help me with some issues I was having.

My brother eventually stopped but my dad cut off all contact with me and later killed himself after my brother started doing heroin again. My brother later took his own life about a week and a half later. This all happened about 1 year ago. I'm 14.

She also knows my dad died, but she doesn't know the details because I didn't want to tell her because I felt like its something I should keep to myself. I have really bad trust issues and this was a big step for me I think.
She knows I struggle with depression and I think she knows about my self harm. But after a long conversation I went onto autopilot and made a comment about me being suicidal. I caused her to cry, i feel bad about it. I don't want to make her feel pain. It only makes me feel worse",30Oct2019,1

Why do people continue to live? What keeps people going, ticking, whatever




The desire for fame, wealth, love, skill, what have you. 







Why do people seek these things? What is the purpose for these desires?




It is to attain to happiness and/or a sense of accomplishment.







What does this happinesses or feeling of accomplishment amount to? 






It could help others, bring joy to others, and most likely bring enjoyment to yourself.





Why is happiness for yourself or others the ultimate goal? Even ""helping others"" ultimately leads to helping them simply enjoy their lives more






It feels good.

23,"I don't really know how to start this so I'll just tell you from the beginning.

When I was around 2 years old my mom separated from my father and until I was 7 years old I lived with grandparents from both sides of my family (more often with my mother's side). I don't remember much until I was 7, just that I was afraid of my grandfather because sometimes he got really mad at my uncle (long story) and sometimes at my grandmother so I was always very... the closest word I can think of is ""tense"", maybe ""afraid"" around him. I don't know, it was a long time ago.

When I was 8 I moved to live with my mother and it was good until I was 14, I started to get addicted to a specific game until I was 16, playing non stop, in holidays playing more than 50hours/week and I started to get angry but still playing it (if I could turn back time I would have kicked the shit out of 14 to 16 year old me every time he thought about that game) and I started being aggressive with my mother. What made me even more angry? The fact that she laughed about the way I acted when I was around her (I was always shaking around her and couldn't think straight because of the anger) and told things, I told her in confidence, to other people in a cynical manner. Then I started to never leave my room, I had such hatred towards my family that I started to have homicidal thoughts towards everyone (i guess it's normal to a teen to want to kill everyone, it's just a phase).

When I turned 16 I realized I wasn't thinking straight so I deliberately got professional help, I don't remember the conversation with the doctor but there is one thing I remember he said: ""It's really strange, your way you talk and how you rationalize things is completely normal, it's very weird for someone like you to do poorly in school."" I was surprised that he said that about my rationalization skills, my family members always disagreed with me in every argument, agreed with me ironically or not even trying hard to hide the fact they were pretending to listen, I always thought that my thoughts we're right and I guess I wasn't expecting an adult to approve them. In later appointments he asks me a question that stuck my mind, I talked about my homicidal thoughts and he asked ""Why don't you go through with those thoughts?"" and I answered obviously ""Because I don't want to go to prison."" After that he diagnosed me with anxiety which was probably true, then he gave me a medication (a muscle relaxant/anti-psychotic) that made me feel like pretty bad, so I talked to my mother and after 2 says, I stopped. I switched doctors due to the contract of the current one ending. The new one talked to me for more that 6 months, I had to talk in a room with more than 10 psychiatrists and in the end they told me I had psychosis. Then I started the same medication from the last doctor...

Two years passed (I was 18) and I returned to where it all started, with my grandparents. It was my own decision so I was feeling good about it. I got there and the first few months were great but I was heavily medicated and feeling super sleepy and tired and it was highschool so of course people are going to make fun of you. But it wasn't only in school, there was a cycle going on with my grandparents that took me a year to say ""enough"". It went like this: 1st I told them what was bothering me; 2nd they used what I told them against me; 3rd I got angry and tell them that I didn't like what they were saying; 4th everything was good and it was all part of the past. That lasted for a year, always repeating and I felt so stupid that I trusted them to change.

I turned 19 and I realized that I couldn't keep up the medication, I felt like shit, I was super fat, I was always breathing through my mouth (I don't know why but it was hard to breathe through my nose) and I wanted to be human, not a zombie. I stopped it cold-turkey. (I was in a ""high"" dose but the only withdrawal symptom I had was constipated diarrhea and insomnia.) After my last dose 23 hours passed, my anxiety was gone and my anger was gone (I guess this is strange because I've never read anywhere that this could happens), I loved the way I was, I hadn't felt like that in year I was happy and I didn't need anyone, I was happy alone with my own thoughts, one of my thoughts was ""All I want to do is to make everyone feel the way I felt, I don't need other people to be happy and now it's my time to hurt them the way they hurt me. If I handled it, so can they."" . After a few weeks a couple of friends asked if I wanted to go out with them and I said yes. Everyone told me I was different, and I could tell I was, I didn't have any problems socializing, I wasn't afraid to walk home alone, I wasn't afraid of anything and I could talk to everyone, I even thought that I might have been manic, but that thought of ""making others feel the way I felt"" disappeared, all I wanted was to socialize, to make other people feel good around me and for me to be happy. That feeling stopped which was a bit of a downer but I blame myself for expecting too much from people. I'm not depressed nor sad, just mad. I realized I now (19 years old) live with manipulative people, after I stopped taking the meds it was clear that my grandparents were manipulating me. After realizing that, first I laughed when I saw their strategy but now it has become annoying and exhausting to the point that I can't be near them. For example, my grandmother started to tear up in front of me and I just smiled at her, just to see what she would do, she kept tearing for 30 seconds, after that she smiled and started laughing and making fun of me, I don't recall what it was. To me, they are and mean absolutely nothing. 

I thought about me having depression and maybe that applies because the only feeling I've had for a long time is anger, but I also feel happy and can function. I've never felt love (I just felt obsessed), instead of feeling empathy I feel angry because I can't talk to people that are suffering, I literally don't know how to help them. The anger and obsessions faded after I stopped taking my medication, I realized that I need to put myself first and others second. I won't feel angry just because someone is sad and I can't help them, it's their problem. If they ask for my help then I'll do my best to help but if I see that I'm making things worse then I'll stop. I've also thought I have ASPD but I don't think so because there are people I respect, people I want to keep around, they mean something to me, they make me feel good and happy and we share interests. The thing is that I can't really love someone, but that doesn't mean I can't respect them. I just don't respect people who make me feel like crap... and that's completely normal.

I want to talk about this to my doctor but since he thought I have psychosis, even though I am not paranoid at all, he might hospitalize me since I am ""psychotic"" and stopped taking medication.",30Oct2019,1

30,"Hi everyone, I don't feel very well in my mind, I need to vent.

This is my story, I want to tell it, to people I don't know. I don't know why, but maybe it gonna help me getting help or realize where I need to start to be happy with myself.

I'm a 27 men from Canada. Be kind about my grammar, english isn't my primary language. I live in Quebec. I have a Girlfriend that I love very much and we've got a kit together. The only problem is that I don't know if i'm in a toxic relationship or not... We'll get to it. But now I don't feel right in my head and I'm not able to talk about it in person to anyone. I'm scared to say anything that could hurt anybody.

If we do a little resume of my biography, i'm a normal boy. I lived an ordinary childhood. My parents were not poor, I even went to private high school. But in elementary and high school I've got bullied a lot because of my shape. I was the fattiest in the whole school. But I wasn't that big. They told me I've got bigger boobs than the girls there and it hurt me enough to make me ark my back so my shirts would hang a little and hid my manboob. The downside of it was that I developed kyphosis and lordosis out of it. And I'm still stuck with that 14 years after.

Even my close friend got fun of me. I told them who was my crush of the time. They told everybody. So today I have a lot of trust issues.

I hated school so much, but there's was one thing that kept me to go to school everyday. A girl, I was so much in love with her. Even today, I can say that I never was that much in love with someone. She was a sunshine in my days. I could have got all the bullying of the world of my back it would have be enough just to see her. At first we were not friend. But after a couples of years we've go pretty close. I've even got in the school choirs just to hang with her. And one day, I told her about my feelings. If I could go back in time I would slap myself so hard! It was the worst way ever to tell your feelings to a girl. But still, it can't erease the 'I can do like you've not told me this' she told me after. I was devastated. The day after she took me into the wood around the school to talk to me. I don't really remember what she told me. But I remember crying all my tears of my body after. The month after was a living hell. I finally did some stupid things that drove me to pedopsychiatric hospital. I drop out of school and finished my highschool in another place. Today I know it wasn't about doing stupid things, but a cry for help. The only problem is, that it's like I'm still angry after her, because she never gave me a chance to prove her that I could be a good match. (Even if I know today I wasn't.) This years mark the 10 years anniversary of my internment. I alway taught myself that it was over. That this time is behind me and that I forgot her. Even if I dream about her some time to time.

But this weekend, while at the mail, I saw her, sitting in a bench, while I was walking pushing my daughter in her stroller. For a moment we we're like 1 feet away from each other. I saw her at the last minute. She was looking at my daughter. I don't know if she saw me of anything. But man, I almost fainted. My hearth was pumping like hell, I got dizzy, it was one of a ride in my head!  Nobody saw nothing. Years and years of trust issues grant me the power to never have an emotion in any moment. At the point that I have to think about having an emotion. I was so affected that I can't stop thinking about it 3 days later. It's like a ghost of the past came hunting me. My present life. My brain was not ready to process to see her and my girlfriend at the same time. And it affect me really much.

About my present life.

I'm with my girlfriend since 2013. Before that, I've got some other girlfriend but the biggest relationship was for about 9 months. I broke up with her because she wanted kids, but really agressive about it. I loved her a lot but I knew we wasn't at the same place of our lives. But I regretted breaking up with her. Because I had a lot of love and kindness with her. She was an angel. And I miss that kind of love and kindness I never had the chance to live with my actual girlfriend.

My actual relationship, if I can resume. Is on auto pilot. Since our daughter arrived in our life. All my gf energy go for her. It's really rare that I get even just a smile. She tell me that she love me only when I told her. Every time I try to just hug her it's really difficult. She don't want me to touch her, or she feel dirty of anything else. In bed it's not really better. She have HUGE condition before intercourse and even like that she tell me that she need to be in the mood to be in the mood, but never allow me to touch her or anything. She's not really mentally stable ether... Her doctor and mental health professional tell her to take some medicine to help her, but she refuse. Taking pills is one of her phobia. On in a lot of phobia. Like: Can't eat a little bellow the date food. Everything need to be extremely fresh. (We trow a lot of food because of that). She can't eat two time the same thing in a week. She's scared about taking pills because it could harm her liver (but will drink like a viking more than ever). And when she drink she become really mean. And she know how to make me fell like shit and do it most of the time.

There's a lot of other things but, the principal is that she complains about litterally anything. And if our daughter get hurt, she have panic attack. She even punch me in one of those panic attack. Why I'm still with her? Mostly because of our daughter, because I'm scared off what she could do, I'm scared to have to fight for my parent duty. I know she's going down emmotionnally and she taking me with her. I'm not happy in our relationship and it can't help anything about it.

And if we spoke about me...

I'm still overweight and lazy. I don't have the energy to do anything. But I love my job and work well. But at home it's another thing. I don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drug. The only pleasure I got in life are working, being with my daughter even If I need to stop being on my phone that much! And sex... The only problem is the occurence... I wan't to do it to relax. But my girlfriend... well you know. And it irritate me so much. It cause me litterally panic attack. I'm scared to talk, to say anything. Even to post anything on facebook. I can't open up to anybody because of my trust issues. But when I can, it's only women because I hate men. And I don't have a lot of female friend because my gf if jealous... So...

I eat my emotions and keep absolutely everything to myself. Because i'm so tired to ear nothing but complains all day long that I don't want anybody to live this.

I know i'm a bomb about to explode. I see my doctor in 3 weeks, I want to changes some things. we'll see...

It’ll be the most random memory too. It might be a scene from a video game I played years ago. But for some reason it then triggers this same scent. I’ve had this for years and I never know how to properly describe it. It’s frustrating at times because I can’t control it. I don’t have the scent without the memory.

34,"Not that long but TL;DR at the bottom anyways.

Hi folks,
26y/o F in and out of talk therapy most of my life, also seeing a psychiatrist.
I've started seeing a psychologist again after a break of several years. Initially (years ago) I was diagnosed with GAD and SAnD and it was fairly easy to stay on topic and have some continuity between appointments.
In the meantime I have been diagnosed with MDD, OCPD, Binge Eating Disorder and working on a possible ADHD diagnosis on top of everything else.
I wanted to go back into therapy to try CBT but
everytime I see my psychologist we end up talking about something different, hardly scratching the surface of the issue before my appointment ends and then moving onto a new issue at the next appointment.
This leaves my care feeling very disjointed and ineffective. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with multiple diagnoses at once?

TL;DR:
I have several comorbid diagnoses and I dont know how to deal with all of them in therapy without constantly feeling like we're just skipping all over the place.
Thanks!",30Oct2019,2
35,"I've been seeing my psychiatrist for a few months and he seems alright. I have trouble trusting mental health professionals but I've been forcing myself to go to my appointments so I can get better.

At our last meeting, he told me to read a certain book before we meet again: *Man's Search for Meaning.* If you haven't heard of it, I'll save you a google search and tell you it's about a psychiatrist's experience as a prisoner in a nazi concentration camp during WW2. My doctor told me he wants to hear my thoughts on the book once I finish it.

I want to know why he would want me to read it.

Have I been complaining too much, and this is his way of reminding me others have had it worse? Does he want me to answer something specific? Is this a test to see if I'll answer my true thoughts or what I think he wants to hear? If there is meaning in suffering, should I suffer more? Am I allowed to relate to the author? Would relating be the wrong answer because his suffering was both physical and psychological and also objectively *so much worse*? In that case, should I not take away anything from the book at all? This feels like a test. I don't want him to write down rude things about me, they find professional words to call you a loser and they joke about it with each other and they never let you see your file. I asked to see mine once and they sent me to the room that was supposedly the file office but it was entirely empty.

Somehow I have taken offense to my doctor asking me to read a book. If I let on that I've been offended, though, that would be the wrong answer too. Oh my god, I could use some advice at this point. I'm so anxious about this and I feel like everyone is out to get me. I don't know, maybe it's the vulnerability. Why am I overthinking this?",30Oct2019,1

He told me that he was on the phone with one of his friends and that his friend had one of the girls at my new school over her name is Brooke so my friend from my old school told me they had got on the topic of me moving to that school somehow and that Brooke said I was emo, annoying, and weird.

Bit of background. I had a difficult childhood. My aunt had a severe stroke when I was the age of 6. She had two children a girl my age and boy 3 years younger. My brother was five at the time. 
My parents took them in as the cause of her stroke was the result of the stress of her upcoming divorce. Id like to say it was a happy ending for my aunt but she was bitter and mean and refused to do any pt to help herself. She coddled her son and ignored her daughter. Long story short, childhood was rough. Led me to get involved in an abusive relationship, which is the primary cause of my PTSD. 
Fast forward to today. I was doing great. Well pretty close to great. I finished school in the field of my dreams. I had a loving boyfriend and a future I was excited about. 
I came home one day and the love of my life told me he no longer romantically loves me. I fought to save the relationship but he had already made up his mind.
I'm lost now. I'm empty and depressed. I go through spells of anger and panic. Substance abuse such as alcohol and maybe just a couple more Xanax than my prescription allows.

38,"Hi everyone!

Just wanted to share a few things I've learned on teaching people how to treat me with respect.

Because it can be so frustrating and disheartening when someone behaves badly towards us and we wish SO MUCH that they can see their bad behavior and correct it.

But unfortunately, we can't change anyone's rude behavior, but I want to focus on what we can control...and that is us.

So here are 3 examples of how we can be in CONTROL and teach others how to treat us with RESPECT, especially when we find ourselves in awkward and disrespectful situations.

Here's a video I made all about it:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvH97uusFng&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvH97uusFng&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

If you prefer reading:

The first way we can teach others how we want to be treated is to

1. Respond don’t React

Say you’re in a good mood, minding your own business. You’re watching your fav youtube channel, and then out of no where your significant other, let’s call him Bob, storms into the room, starts yelling about how enormous the electricity bill is this month. Then he starts blaming it on you, because you like to keep your heater on. And he starts calling you names..like stupid and careless

When this happens, what emotions are you feeling? You’re probably feeling a variety of emotions. Angry that Bob stormed in and yelled, confused as to why the bill is so high, guilty because you think you may be the culprit of the high electricity bill, and mostly hurt because Bob is being disrespectful.

And you’ve got a couple of choices on how to address this situation:

• 1. You can choose to react negatively which means you change your good mood and take on the negativity, which now puts YOU in a BAD mood and then you fight back and start yelling at Bob and calling him names. OR

• 2. You can choose to respond positively. Which means that you don’t engage with his negative actions. Instead you calmly say “I understand that you may be feeling frustrated right now, Bob. However, I don’t want to talk to you when you’re yelling at me and calling me names. I find it completely disrespectful. So, I’m going to leave the room and when you’re a bit more calm, then I’ll be more than happy to talk with you.

See the difference. When we choose to react, we take on whatever emotion the other person is feeling and we wear it. Our good mood gets ruined and we immediately go into a negative headspace.

But when we respond, we’re not going to take on negative emotions. We’re not going to allow ourselves to get pushed down to the other person’s level. We take control of the situation and distance ourselves from it, so it doesn’t affect us at all. When we do this, we TEACH the other person that we don’t accept that kind of behavior towards us.

I like to look at this situation the same as if you were dealing with a toddler throwing a tantrum. Because essentially this is what the other person is doing--acting like a toddler. And If a toddler yelled and screamed at you, you wouldn’t yell and scream back, right? You would calmly explain what is an acceptable way to talk to you. You don’t yell back at them and call them names, because you’ve got to role model and SHOW THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS what is acceptable behavior. That’s how they learn. Right?

The exact same principle applies to adults. Whenever we run into someone who is acting disrespectful towards us, we respond by staying calm and in control of our words and actions, instead of reacting negatively by mimicking the other person’s rude behavior.

The next way we teach people how to treat us is to:

2. Enforce Boundaries

Say you’ve had one of the most stressful work days of your life and you have a coworker who invites you out to dinner. But you are EXHAUSTED and all you can think about is wrapping yourself in a blanket, grabbing your fav snack, and vegging out to your fav Netflix show.

So you’ve got two choices to make when this kind of situation happens: You say yes to your coworker and spend the rest of the evening probably regretting your decision.

Or you can set a boundary and communicate your wants and needs. A boundary is basically understanding what is best for you -emotionally, physically, and mentally. So, in this example, what you may feel is best is to say “no” because you want to rest. So as a response to our coworker we can say “Thanks so much for the invite. I won’t be able to make it tonight but I hope you have fun.”

Now, if we say yes, even if we don’t want to go…we may be the type of person who says yes to everything, regardless of what it is, because we don’t want to disappoint anyone or we don’t want to be seen as the boring person. The problem with this is that we become the “yes person.” People start to know us as the “yes” person, so they think they can ask us to do anything, because we will ALWAYS agree… Why do they do that? Because we’ve unintentionally taught people that’s what we do. If we never stand up for ourselves. If we never say no, then people learn… “oh ok, she says yes to everything, so if I ask anything of her, I know she’ll do it.”

Now, if we have the courage to say no, then sometimes we have someone who doesn’t respect our boundaries and tries to push us to do something anyway. And usually there’s some flattery or guilt thrown in like…

“please it won’t be the same without you!” or...”just this one time…you hardly ever go out” or “you don’t want to leave me hanging do you” Do these responses sound familiar to you? It’s hard to say no when we get these sort of responses, right?

But if we change our response from no to yes…then without even realizing, we teach people that they can push our boundaries if they want a certain response from us.

Again, this situation reminds me of communicating with a child. If a child asks for a piece of chocolate and you tell them they can’t have any…then they may throw a tantrum, or use flattery or try to guilt you by saying “you never let us have chocolate” or “pleaseee I’ve been so good today” you’re the best mom in the whole world”

If you give in and say yes, then that teaches the child that they can push your boundary to get what they want when you say no.

So, whenever we say no, it needs to be firm. Whenever we enforce any kind of boundary, we need to be firm with it.

When we do this, we teach people that we respect ourselves and they should do the same.

The next way we teach people how we want to be treated is by:

3. Communicate Your Feelings

Say you have a family member who always picks on you about your career. In so many words, they tell you that your job isn’t good enough and that you need to make more money. When they do this, it can make you feel angry, upset, or frustrated, because it makes you feel as if you’re not good enough even though you LOVE your job.

When this kind of situation arises, whenever a family member picks on you about something, usually two things happen, o You give the silent treatment and avoid this family member like the plague or 

o You just take it. You sit there. say nothing. and maybe even kinda laugh it off a bit

But when you do those two things, it’s not addressing the issue that is at hand which is: when that family member says unkind words to you, it makes you feel worthless. And because you’re not communicating with that family member, you’re essentially showing them that it’s ok to say those things.

So, what we should do instead is communicate our wants and needs with that family member. We should tell them how we feel when they say something that offends us and that we would appreciate it if they stopped.

Now some family members are completely oblivious when they say hurtful things to us. They aren’t intentionally trying to be mean or hurtful…they just have no idea that what they’re saying is offensive. And it takes us standing up and communicating with them, so they can realize that their words are actually hurtful. When this happens, they usually feel pretty bad and change their behavior.

Other times, you have family members who keep repeating the bad behavior, which at that point, you’ll have to set and enforce some boundaries, which may mean that you have communicate to them that you are going to distance yourself until they are able to correct their behavior.

Otherwise, if you do nothing, they don’t take you seriously and continue with their behavior.",30Oct2019,1

40,"I self-harmed for ten years before I quit a little over two years ago. 

I’ve been going through an incredibly low period the last two days, and today I’m feeling worse than I have in months. 

I keep spiralling, thinking worse and worse. I keep fantasizing about suicide. I have my suicide planned but I don’t want to do it until I move out of my parents house. Telling myself that I have to wait at least another three years (until I finish my diploma) is so hard. 

I feel like if I self-harm it will stop the negative spiralling and at least leave my mind empty for a while. I’m losing the resolve to stop. I’ve tried distracting myself all day and have used all the regular coping mechanisms. 

I’ve emailed my therapist, took a shower, hung out with my pets, used a crisis texting service, watched a funny TV show, and tried being productive (currently doing some chores.) nothing is helping and I have no one I can talk to.

41,So I wanna start off by saying I’m 18 and a lot of people would say that I’m “cold” or unfeeling.

42,"I’ve always had anxiety but haven’t we all it was just basic stuff that everyone has problems with but recently my anxiety has skyrocketed I just moved to a new school this year because my old school became to much for me I thought the change would be good but I had a hard time making friends I thought this would blow over and eventually I’d start talking to people but I feel like I’m constantly shot down every time I try to make conversation with someone there they just act like they aren’t interested whatsoever and most of the time they don’t even answer me they just glare at me at first I thought I was just overthinking things that I just need to talk more and maybe it would get better I started to feel better about it until my friend from my old school called me. He told me that he was on the phone with one of his friends and that his friend had one of the girls at my new school over her name is Brooke so my friend from my old school told me they had got on the topic of me moving to that school somehow and that Brooke said I was emo, annoying, and weird. We hadn’t talk to each other in five years the last time I saw here was in 3rd grade and she just judged me right off the bat. This crushed me I spent the next few night crying. I dreaded going back to school when I started to feel like everyone’s watching me and laughing at everything I do I feel like no one likes me or wants to talk to me and I can’t figure out why. It just bothers me so much. I spend most of my days now wondering why I’m not pretty enough or why people just seem to immediately stop liking me. Another problem is my breast are more developed than most girls my age so during gym I hate running any exercising I just feel like everyone’s watching nag me and I hate it. every second of my day is spent just being terrified of being humiliated. I’ve given up trying to make friends. My own cousin doesn’t even want to talk to me anymore. I feel like I may have a real anxiety issue but I’m so scared to talk to my parents about it because I feel like my mom is just gonna say that it’s hormones and that everyone goes through this and that she’s sorry and hopes it gets better every time I come to her with something that I think is serious she says that same stuff.

45,"I've been a NEET for almost a year now again, after quitting school a second time.
While at least now I got basic things like hygiene and eating properly in check and quit drinking alcohol almost entirely I still suffer from a severe lack of motivation to do anything on many days and end up procrastinating away day after day in front of my computer.

However recently there have been some big things happening in my life. I've lost almost all contact to all friends except for one and found a couple of new ones. I've also found a girlfriend and had some relatives dying and after all my life somehow doesn't feel like it did before anymore. The relationship feels underwhelming even though I love my gf and I can't find a reason why it does. I have lost sight of all goals I had previously and I now don't think getting a job to fix my financial situation, moving out and generally getting my life in check, is gonna make me happy again.
Also the relationship feels surreal to me. Like it's not actually happening but just a thing in my mind and some meaningless sex. I somehow feel just as envious and anxious about her really liking me as if I was still single, even though I should know better and I get to spend a good amount of time with her.

The fact I've definitely got a spending addiction that I can't get in check and I'm writing minor red numbers most of the time doesn't make it better. I keep buying video games I'll never play and when I actually manage to save some money I'll usually just spend it on stuff that friends want me to do like going to a restaurant or a concert with them when I really can't afford to.

I feel like I wanna start a new life because everything I have left in this one is feeling surreal and I feel unable to get back on the right path.

I have had temporary motivation boosts for some weeks after the use of psychedelic drugs before. Maybe when I can find a day I feel confident enough for it they can help me again. They can be a good crutch.

I'm just happy to get all of this off my chest because I'm too anxious to tell anybody I know.

Hi guys,

In  the wake of the release of Joker, I'm working on a project centered  around the representation of different mental health issues in  mainstream films. I'll be looking at how portrayals of several different  disorders contribute to stigma surrounding the issues. I'll be arguing  how films such as Shutter Island, Fight Club and Split glamourise mental  illnesses, create associations between them and violence and ultimately  drive misinformation which negatively impacts upon public perceptions  of different disorders.

Was just  wondering if anyone would like to share their thoughts and experience on  these things and others such as the realities of mental illness vs. film representations, how they have been affected by the  release of any particular films and other any issues surrounding day to  day stigma?

Would be very grateful for any contributions.

Much appreciated

i dont really want to do names however im on the brink of 18, have already graduated, have a job, and am in college. im just gonna get into this. for awhile now ive felt as if i dont know who i am. i often times change my career paths or the way i think about things. i tend to dress in different ways or the way i feel about the world every day and it makes me feel like shit. i have a long history of depression and substance abuse so this probably has some effect, i am however feeling a lot better and have been clean for some time. i just want to know how i can find myself, my beliefs, the way i want to dress, or where i want to be. if i keep on going like this im afraid i might take steps to a career that may effect my future or the paths ill be able to take. i would just like some help. maybe some books or videos or something that can help guide me.

56,"Short Background: Male, 19 years of age, German

&amp;#x200B;

I got out of therapy around a month ago. I had a very pleasent experience there and learned alot about myself and psychology in general. As written above I got diagnosed with (what seems to me) a boatload of disorders. I knew going in I was depressed. I had been thinking of taking my own life rather often and I had no real drive to go forward. I had tried visiting therapy before but it was a rather distructive experience. Aside from that I knew I had shown strange thought and behavioural patterns. Constantly criticising myself, questioning my actions and things I said and such. Something I had become accustomed to over the years and while I knew it wasn't healthy I didn't think I could do anything about it. Eitherway, being given the diagnosis of my personality disorders worried me. Looking back I can recognize alot of the behaviour in myself, described in the general behaviour in those with these disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

I have hurt alot of my friends with my paradoxical actions. Crying out for help one minute, then blocking and removing them from all social media, which is the main way I have contact with anyone these days. I feel immense guilt and I worry constantly that they secretly hate me. I KNOW they don't but I FEEL like they do, if that makes any sense. This worry that people hate me is also a constant follower and something my therapist commented on a couple of times. They described it as ""a firm believe that any relationship is built on the believe that the person sitting infront of you hates you"". Another thing I struggle with is the lack of self worth as it's practically non existent. The only way I can regulate my feeling of self worth is through fishing for constant feedback from people and I fear this leads to a certain disassociation between me and them. Almost like I'm only using my friends and aquaintances for personal gain, so to speak. There's alot more I could go into here right now but I feel this might bloat the post more then it already is.

 

I feel great worry and guilt writing here as well. It's 5 am as of typing this and having spent a sleeples night mulling over my issues and current live situation has led me here. I worry my post could be seen as attention seeking, which in a way it is (see section above for comment on my lack of self worth). this kind of behaviour is generally seen as selfish which in turn makes me feel awful.

 

I'm planning to move out soon, this has me excited yet worried for obvious reasons as living on my own might be harder then I'm imagining right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be greatful for input from people who have any insight into a similar situation and how they may handle it. Any ideas going  forward and if any of my fears and worry is even justified. If anyone needs more specific information please just ask as im usually open to share my thoughts and feelings. Sorry for any typos I may have missed.",30Oct2019,1
57,"As the title states, my mental health has been going down since March of this year. I lost my job because of it, and moved back home to my parents.

However, my mental health just seemed to decrease more and more, and I've relapsed back into self-harming behavior. I've even given up my car keys and drivers license due to how I was planning my own suicide.

I feel like I need to be hospitalized to be able to get the help I need, but I'm scared of never coming out, or seeing my friends again (I have paranoid thoughts of them hating me if I don't talk to them), or of ever getting better again.

I just want to live my life again, without consently wanting to die or think that the world hates me.

Anyways, some people in my classes are really negative and lower my self esteem a lot. There is this one kid in my math class that is really obnoxious and brags about his *amazing* grades. He always puts down others just to make himself feel better. There is this other kid in my health class who I thought was nice, but turns out to be a huge ass. He keeps on making fun of me and how I'm lonely and have no friends. At first we got along, but now I'm just realizing his toxicity. I don't know how to avoid them because I see them everyday. The second person I mentioned calls me dumb and yells inappropriate things out loud for no reason. He introduced me to his friends that are equally as toxic. I would consider them the losers of the class, just because they are not popular with the rest of the class and are rude people. One of my classmates who is nice told me not to hang out with them and join their friend group because one of them will start smelling me or something (IDK).

59,"It’s really difficult figuring out how to deal with your parents, especially when they can be over brewing and controlling. 


After an incident with my parents where I was almost thrown out due to my mom invading my privacy (you can see my previous post), we are working over it now and are much better. I am actually willing to see their side and understand them more because I really do see how much they love me. But I’m still having trouble understanding their behaviors sometimes. Moreso my mother. My dad is not one to hold grudges. I see their sides but I constantly feel like my mom isn’t normal as well. I felt bad for not appreciating what she’s done for me but Even tho I do, I realize now she uses that to guilt trip me into accepting some of their “not-so-nice” behaviors. It’s like.....manipulative in a way. 

So, my mom had called my boyfriend the other day to ask him some questions about a specific thing she was upset about and he returned her call after he got off his work shift. She never returned back his call since she didn’t want to explode on him and would feel bad. However, she just never returned it, never gave a text back telling him “it’s okay now, never mind” or at least something. My boyfriend text her a couple days later when he was off from college classes, just checking if everything is okay because he wasn’t sure why she just called him out of the blue like that. She reassured him everything was okay and that was that. Her last text to him was her response to him asking if they were going to church since he wanted to come, “Yes we are and you’re welcome to come”. My mother then starts to nitpick or complain that he didn’t respond to her last message. Saying maybe “okay”. I left it alone because I found it odd she would seem to get a bit salty at that,  when there was not much say back? 

So I left that alone.....later we find out that we are busy this weekend so we can’t go to church. She tells me tonight that she went “out of her way” as she put it because she “didn’t have to”, to text him today at 9:30 am that we will not be going to church this weekend and by her words “he didn’t BOTHER to text her back”. My boyfriend didn’t really respond back, til 12 hours later. I agree he shouldn’t taken a minute to respond but mind you. He’s in college with classes all day. He has an early morning class with a long assignment that was due at 6 pm today, and his OTHER class goes from 5pm-9:30 pm. Long ass class. This is actually one of his worst days of the week. Because also after his morning class he catches a   quick nap. She then goes on to say how he’s a little rude and coming home late from college today, she begins to have an attitude with me creating some unnecessary tension between us. She seems to really be taking this personally. I had reminded him to text her back, and he did apologizing to her. And honestly what he said really broke my heart because he really values my mom, and her approval and her love.....and this is one of the reasons why I begin to not like her.....

I felt so bad, I showed him what she said he said “This is a problem I have even with my parents. I should’ve taken a minute to respond. Idk why but seeing her say that breaks my heart more than my own mom saying it...” 

.....

He then texts her right after he gets out of class saying “Thank you for letting me know. I have a lot of things to do so I’m not sure if I’ll be able to go but I’ll definitely give hmmm it a shot. I’m sorry for not getting back to you earlier I’ve been pretty busy all day doing homework and working on a project. I hope you didn’t think I was ignoring the message.” 

All she says is: “ok” 

I mean idk, is this narcissistic behavior? Was my boyfriend wrong in this situation? While I do agree he could’ve taken ANY minute in the day to give her a quick text, it was a simple slip up. I mean. Is she forgetting that this dude called her and she didn’t even return it. He even texted her as a follow up just to make sure everything was okay, since she didn’t “BOTHER” to do that either. It’s like she’s getting mad at him and me for the things she does. It really broke my heart when all she said “ok” compared to what he said. I’m really trying to see my moms side of things. But this is the stuff that blocks all of that. It’s like I see a side of her that’s sympathetic, understanding and even crying her eyes out, and then there’s this side....

Idk I constantly feel like she only looks or negative things about my boyfriend on her purpose. Like she’s trying to get rid of him. And I heard she’s trying to set me up for lunch with some guy to see if we’d get along well. IDEK. I can’t stand that behavior. My boyfriend has made some mistakes. But never to the point, where it’s unhealthy or he makes me feel a certain way. I just feel my mom is very odd, and way too sensitive. And can be a overbearing. For example, she like to go thru my phone randomly.

She just has tension with me now I guess for no reason. All I did was come home from class in college. These are things that give me anxiety because she’s one of those moms, that feel like they got the power to do anything and will abuse that power. So I always get afraid of what she might do or what she may imprison me more with. There’s always that nice, loving side but then there’s that side...",30Oct2019,2
60,"I'm not sure if you are all familiar with the CBAT acronym, but it boils down to ""Community-Based Acute Treatment"" and I was sent to one such facility for two weeks nearly 10 years ago (this upcoming March) and I still have nightmares about the entire experience.

I am 25 years old now -- a grown man.... ye t I still have nightmares and awful flashbacks to that single, 2 -week period of my teenage life.   


The whole reason I was even sent there was to scare me into attending school -- which worked for about 2 weeks. Afterwards I fell back into the same patterns of extreme anxiety and fear surrounding school (I had been sent to a private, self-proclaimed ""therapeutic"" school at the time) and despite all of that I still was deathly afraid to even enter the building. My last day there I was in my favorite class (History) and some kid from another class burst into the room and started yelling and throwing desks around.  They had private little rooms to excuse yourselves to or to have 1 on 12 meetings with teachers in and I had to excuse myself to one such room just to put my head on the table and cry.   It was what should have been my  Junior Year  (11th Grade) of High School but by that point I only had nearly half of the credentials I needed to advance from 9th grade. I dropped out at 16 and earned my GED shortly there-afterwards.... But I still feel like a gigantic loser and failure.

70,"most of the time my mind is pretty absent. im posting this because i cant tell anybody else, because i dont talk to anybody else. im considering some dark stuff. but im going to see my psych again. im not going to be hospitalized again though. anyways. 

im very uncomfortable with myself, my body and personality and such. to be more specific, i dont like the lower area if you know what i mean. i never have. this is a very personal issue for me and not easy to talk about. it also feels kind of irrelevant.

i have this feeling that im going to die soon. i want to run away to a country, less developed than my own, and live a new life. whats scary is that the more i fantasize about it and the more i research it, the more it seems possible and like something i would want to do. leaving everything behind honestly seems like the easiest part.

well. who knows. theres a lot of information i could put out. but im paranoid about other people knowing things. should i post on some lgbt subreddit? i dont know much about that. i feel like i need to tell someone about whats going on but even typing this is making my heart race.

71,"These past few days have been pretty stressful. 

Mostly today.

I think enlightening is a good word for the two thing about myself and my situation that have come to light. 

They are both pretty long so I dont expect you to hang around. 

First will be my romantic situation. Emotionally, physically, and socially I have improved hugely this past year and a half. I am happier than I ever was in high school. I'm in better shape. I go to the gym 5 times a week and really enjoy it. I have gotten so much better at taking to people. I was even described as an extrovert and good infront of people by several different people. I have gotten better at making friends with people I see everyday. But I am further from finding anyone to love than I have ever been. In high school I have a good 6 girls who I knew where into me. A couple even asked me out. I said no because I was in a bad place and was not ready for a relationship. There were 2 my first semester of college who ghosted me for weeks after our first date before I finally got in touch and they said they weren't interested. The better I have gotten the further I have gotten from finding anyone.

 I dont get it. 

Part two is mostly guess work going off what my teacher says and what other classmates talk about. 

Not to me or anything but about topics in class. 

I made the mistake of seeing Joker. Dont get any bad ideas. 

Turns out I may have a trigger for abnormal psychology. I have notices this since freshman year of high school but only now do I see that it could be real thing for my reaction to things like that. I often try to avoid movies, articles, books, images, or anything relating to abnormal psychology because how I react to it. I thought I was over it but know i see that i am not after watching it and spiraling a good bit. I've started smoking again, I have gotten too little sleep, I have been having bad thoughts again, and people no longer seem real. I dont know whether or not this is real or  I am just being stupid. 

I cant tell.",30Oct2019,1

73,"I know i need to talk to somone but I feel like I have no one to go to. So I'm just gonna rant on here until I feel better.

I'm 15, sophomore in highschool. Recently I've been dealing with really bad anxiety and I'm stressed out all the time. Theres lots of problems going on in my life right now and at times I feel so hopeless. I never expected to find myself in the situation I am in now. I messed up badly, possibly fucked my future up. 

I recently got arrested for possession of a schedule 1 substance with intent to distribute. I'm (was) a good honors student, got good grades, I never got in any trouble. I was a good kid and now I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I've dealt with depression in the past but it's never been this bad.

I think to myself how could I fuck up this bad?
How did I end up like this? How could I just throw everything I have away for something so stupid.
Growing up as a kid I had it good, my parents always supported me, I had a good childhood and it's not their fault I messed up.

 When I got to middle school I feel like that's when it all started to go downhill for me. I was still a good kid, still got good grades, and I still stayed out of trouble. But during this time is when it all hit me at once and it was hard for me. My mom and dad were fighting alot they were gonna get separated because my dad cheated on my mom. During this time my brother also became addicted to hard drugs. It got really bad with my brother, he started beating my mom and we were scared of him. He would lose control and hit us. I remember I wasn't allowed to leave my moms room because she was scared my brother would do something to me. My dad is a truck driver and he drives all across the U.S. so he was never home for all of this. Because he was away all the time I would never see him, mabey just 2 or 3 times a year. At times I felt like I didnt have a dad, I know he was working and providing for us but I still felt like I didnt have my dad. The times he would come he and my mom would just end up fighting so he would just leave early. Because of all this I fell in a really bad depression.

I stopped talking to people, I lost all my freinds, I was so lonley. What made it worse was the bullying. At school I was looked at as the weird lonley kid. People would make fun of me for not having freinds, make fun of my clothes and stuff like that. I started playing lots of video games during this time. I used video games as a way to escape reality. I used it to distract me from everything that was going on. Video games saved me, I dont know what else I would've done. It got really bad, like I was playing for 12+ hours everyday. Eventually I stopped wanting to go to school, my grades started dropping, then I stopped going completely. I missed about the last 3 months of my 8th grade year but I still barley passed becuase of independent study. 

When I got to highschool so many things changed for me. I moved to a new city and went to a new school. My brother ended up living on the streets so we didnt have to deal with him anymore. My mom and dad made up and they're still together. I felt like I had a fresh start, and I did. Becuase I didnt have any freinds or didnt talk to any people, my social skills were horrible. After 2 years of barley socializing with anyone other than people online, it was really hard for me to make freinds at first. 

My freshman year of highschool was really the turning point for me. For the first time in a long time, I started talking to people, making freinds, and I started to enjoy school again. I felt like I finally had something going for me. From then on things only got better. During this time I also stopped playing as much video games and I started to feel happy again. 

Around half way through my freshman year I smoked weed for the first time. This opened alot of doors for me. I met so many new people and I made alot of new freinds. Eventually they were the only people that I hung out with. I got influenced by them alot. Looking back at it now I just wanted freinds and I found them. I started slacking off more and more. As time passed my grades started to drop. I ended up finishing my freshman year with a gpa below 2.0 

My sophomore year. Going into my sophomore I told myself I would stop slacking off and start focusing more on school. That didn't happen.
I got involved in alot of stuff that I probably shouldn't have been involved in. Eventually I just stoped trying in school completely. My grades plummeted from there. I started to fail all my classes and I just gave up. Long story short because I feel like I've been writing this for wayy to long, one thing leads to another and I got arrested for possession and intent to distribute a schedule 1 controlled substance.

Fast forward a bit to the present. I've had sometime to reflect on my errors. I know what I did was wrong and I dont know how I ever allowed myself to screw up so badly. I had it so good and I fucked it all up. I was blinded by ignorance. I wish I could go back and right my wrongs. I was a fool. Now I dont know what to do.  No college is gonna accept me with bad grades and a record. Sometimes I wish I stayed the quiet and respectful kid I was. 

I've been trying to right my wrongs. I've been trying to get my grades up and recover. I feel so hopeless at times. I feel like no matter how hard I try I'll never be able to fully recover. My anxiety and stress has been really bad lately. Today at school I had my first panick attack, it was really bad. What hurts the most is letting my parents down. They did their best but I still let them down. All of this has really just put me in a bad mental state. I don't know what to do. Most nights the anxiety is so bad that I just cry myself to sleep. I feel so hopeless I just wanna lay in bed and cry all day.",30Oct2019,1

I will ask my friends a million times if they think I’m pretty or just acquaintances and every time they reassure me. But, the times that the answer isn’t something I want, it ruins my mood completely. It will be on my mind forever and make me feel pretty to ugly really quick. My looks get me really depressed to the point where I question if live is worth living. I think about my looks more than anything in the world. My sister gets the worst of it, I ask her questions like, “Do you think I look like a man?”, “Are my boobs saggy?”, “Do I look sick or unhealthy?”, I ask her so many questions that some sound so ridiculous. Not only that, but I always think people are judging me, no matter what. For example, in my class, I sit in the front. I try not to move too much, because I worry that people will judge me for moving too much. Or, if I use my phone during class, I worry that people think of me as stupid and a dumb ass. Not only that, but I always think that people are talking about me when I leave the room. It sounds so stupid, because why would a teacher talk about me to the class? But, my mind is so convinced and the feeling just won’t leave no matter how much logic tried to tell me I’m being ridiculous. I know it’s not body dysmorphia, because there are times I do feel pretty. I also hate how one person’s opinion of me, in my brain, is 100% facts. If one person tells me, “mm you look pretty, but your hair is kind of funny”, I Will assume that everyone thinks that of me too and will do everything in my power to change my hair. It’s as if I’m trying to please everyone. I know that the truth is is that no one cares about me like that, but I can’t help it.

I told him this made me uncomfortable and he got super defensive, disregarding my feelings and explaining this meant nothing. I told him I understood him and believed him, but he made no efforts to understand the fact that I was uncomfortable with this situation.

Should I not have gotten uncomfortable by this action? I know “likes” are a silly thing, but when in a relationship for years I think it’d be normal to want a partner to be understanding when you’re uncomfortable with their actions.

Small things like this get me into a really bad mood. Can’t sleep, don’t wanna do anything, don’t wanna get up out of bed, etc. so it really impacts me.

86,"Basically, there's been a lot of trauma in my life regarding my father. Held my family hostage at gunpoint when I was 9. Recently, he was indicted on capital murder charges on a meth binge. I'll spare you the gruesome details but he murdered someone with a pair of gardening loppers. 

I don't feel like I care that much about this. I rarely think of it, I eat normally, I work, I enjoy hobbies, have a social life, etc. However, he shows up in my dreams a lot, and these dreams usually end with him shooting me. 

I'm not exactly a professional but that sounds a hell of a lot like memory repression to me. Can that actually be having a negative effect on my life? I have noticed since his indictment that I've been lazier than normal, but I wouldn't call it depression or anything.

About a year ago something changed. Some old childhood memories came back and I began to have completely unrelated dreams.

I dream of stabbing someone, or more like shaking someone to death, with 8 or more stabs. The worst about it, is that they are axtremly vivid. I can feel the Blood on my hand, I can see his scared eyes, I can feel him stiff up in Schock and how life leaves him in the end. I wake up about once times a week, in the dead of night, completly convinced that I just murdered some one and that I will go to prison for life.

Also I began hating fluids on my hands. Every time they are only very slightly sticky I wasch my hands, multiple times every hour. It just feels like the Blood.

During day, I sometimes have pictures flash I fornt my eyes, how I could murder this person, sitting next to me in the bus. The problem is, I am a little bit paranoid and always have a knife with me. So I feel like my dreams are,'t far from reality.

I knew that she used to cry alot because of it but i would talk to her to brighten her mood, today, she told me tht she had cut herself and i believe this time it wont just be enough to brighten her mood. Some of her exact words are after she told me abt her cuts,

94,"It's winter, so my head isnt in the right place any way. 

I have a history of being ""horrible minded"" in the winter due to the lack of sunlight, and all that jazz, but my mind is literally starting to wind me up something chronic! 

I've previously been put on medication to 'numb' my thoughts, as they have gotten to the point where I cant go out of the house due to paranoid thoughts. (I'm not dressed right for the weather, people will think I'm weird, I walk funny, it's dark, I might get attacked etc) 

I'm currently struggling at work with these thoughts. It was my birthday recently, for which I went on holiday. Now, everyone gets a card for the birthday at my work place - even if no one particularly likes them. I've come back to work, with no card, no happy birthday but a card is going round for someone else, also a wedding card. (Dont they like me that much to not get me a card?) 

I've never been an outspoken person, very much introverted. I find it incredibly hard to make conversation, and make friends with the fear that they'll think I'm far to weird. I've also struggled with recognising my personality, and have confident issues regarding trying to 'be me' when I cant figure out who I, as a person, am! 

I've been there nearly 10 months, and I havent made friends, and I hardly talk to people- my management have pulled me in because of this, worried for me. I've simply told them, I'm quiet, I talk when spoken too, and make coffee when people want it and get my job done to go home and chill out because social interaction for me is very hard. 

I need help, and not in a drs sense, but from an outside view to realise that maybe I'm being silly? 

How do I make conversation? How do I stop worrying that people dont like me(I feel like I've got a 6th sense when someone doesnt). How do I be...me, in this horrible time of dark mornings, dark evenings, and staring at the wall for hours letting my mind getting overridden with horror?!",30Oct2019,1
95,"I have a relative who has had depression for years.  She is on the waiting list for mental health treatment and in the meantime was seen by an assessor and had some sessions with a mental health professional, called the Change programme.  They listened and talked to her about her depression and eating disorder, and said the treatment she's waiting for could help with that (I can't remember what the actual treatment is called.)

However she has another issue, which is distressing her greatly and which she has told the mental health team about, but the mental health team clearly have no idea what it is, and so pretty much ignore it and change the subject when she talks about it.  Basically, she goes through periods, lasting sometimes weeks and sometimes months, where she feels either intensely spiritual or intensely religious, and then it goes away.  It causes her to do things she wouldn't otherwise do.  At first the feelings were just spiritual, and caused her to believe in new age stuff (can't remember what she said exactly).  She didn't mind this.  However, a few years ago these feelings stopped being new age/spiritual and became Christian.  

Basically for a few months she'll be just a normal depressed agnostic person, then she'll suddenly find herself intensely believing in Christianity to a distressing extent.  She starts confessing her sins - in other words telling people any little unpleasant thing she might have done and trying to make it up to them, she'll throw away all her heavy metal music, thinking it's of the devil, and she'll be in a constant state of terror that she'll spend eternity in hell if she doesn't have enough faith in Jesus.

Then eventually those feelings go away and she regrets getting rid of her music and confessing all the bad little things she's done, and is always worried about the religious feelings coming back.  She's on benefits as she has too many physical and mental problems to work and she's very worried that she'll be in this religious state when her next benefits assessment comes around, because the bible says ""he who will not work, let him not eat,"" and she might find herself saying she's fine and refusing benefits because of this and then regretting it when the religiosity goes away.  She's also worried when these feelings go away, in case the feelings are actually god reaching out to her and if she stops believing then she'll go to hell.

Does anyone know what could be causing this as the mental health team seem at a loss and aren't taking it seriously, but my cousin says it's far more distressing than the depression or eating disorder.",30Oct2019,1

97,"I noticed that my academic performance was decreasing and my anxiety was to blame, so I went to the school general psycologist whom referred me to a psychology nurse, she sent me to relaxation therapy and referred my case to a psychiatrist next month to know if I need medication or not.

I have bad intrusive memories that bother me and can ruin my day, I try to talk this to my mother, in fact I've been asking her for at least 5 years for psychological attention and she usually says that I can get over it alone ""If you want to feel better that's up to you"" (thanks I'm cured) and low-key tells me that all I is want to call the attention. 

The truth is that I suffered from depression and anxiety since I was a child due to the constant psychological and physical abuses from o my half sister who babysitted me since I was a 4. I even showed child abuse sings at school I cried a lot, hid under the table, didn't socialize that much, sucked my thumb (I still do after 12 years and I'm working hard to leave it. It concerned a lot the general psychologist but she didn't want to tell me much) but teachers thought I was just spoiled. 

At the age of 5 our guardian teacher and the principal convocated an assembly to exonerateme from preschool and send me directly to first grade. They tell me the principal liked to go to my classroom at lunch time and talk with me, she liked how enthusiastic of science I was and how much I liked learning. But just one teacher was against my upgrading and her argument was that I wasn't emotionally mature enough. 

You have no idea how many opportunities I've lost for being an emotional cripple and how much I've been struggling to endure emotionally, just see how events that happened 13 years ago still affect me. I've to add the bullying I suffered in all my fucking school years (except this and the last year when they changed me from school). 

I'm in a new school I became completely different.

I'm currently quite good at dealing with oncoming depressive episodes as I've learnt over the years to know when they're coming on and have coping mechanisms in place to lessen the blow. Problem is, I'm now in my first full time job, in my dream career path and now that it's getting winter that nice seasonal low is coming on strong. I'm talking lethargy, no drive, having a hard time getting out of bed, feeling tired all the time etc. Usually I would just completely chill out for a few days, go on a cleaning spree etc, but i can't do that now, since I have to go to work for 9 hrs a day and I definitely can't afford to take any sick days anymore atm.

100,"Not using a throwaway; not ashamed for having strong feelings.

I have been heavily involved in competitive activities since I was 3 and picked up t-ball. Multiple sports through high school, college athletics, and I've been playing competitive card and video games (M:tG/Hearthstone, Rocket League, speedrunning, etc) ever since.

I have a wife and 5 children (3 bio, 2 foster) that I love dearly, and a good job. No outside reason that I can identify for feeling how I do.

But every 4-6 months, I have a while where I feel very weighed down and upset because I have this competitively-driven desire to be ""the best"" at something. I find it difficult to enjoy activities if I can't ""beat"" someone at them. It's not a negative compulsion either. I truly enjoy doing competitive things and I can't imagine my life without doing something competitive. I enjoy the games I play and I'm generally good-to-very-good at them. But without any type of achievements, awards, recognition, or tournament results, I just slowly begin to feel awful about it.

That's how I am currently. I can't get out of my slowed down, mopey mood. I'm not currently enjoying anything because I recognize that no matter what I'm doing, no one cares and I'm not the best at it. I'm finding myself googling things like ""video games with highest skill ceiling"" or ""e-sports tournaments near me"" and just feeling terrible about myself.

I rarely drink, I've never done drugs or smoked, and after recovering from a serious foot injury, I've been working out 4x a week for 2 months and am feeling much better health-wise. It just doesn't seem like I have any reason to feel like I do, but I can't handle feeling like I'm not the best.

I work as a forklift driver, at work I only have to interact with one or two people.

Lately it’s increased to where I don’t want to interact with my wife or children.
When forced to be around others I become increasingly agitated.
The only things I generally want to do is work with my hobbies or read.
I do not have social anxiety, I can be very extroverted or have been in the past.
I’m intelligent, 134 IQ but I’ve never had the drive to do anything with it.
I dislike unintelligent conversation, it’s not stimulating.
The majority of people simply want to talk about their day, or complain about this or that.

That being said, my tendency towards social isolationism is causing problems in my life.
I’m not sure how to break the cycle or if I truly even want to.

106,"Hey guys , 

First time on this page; thought I would try to see if y'all have any advice or ideas on what has been going on in my life.  Well I'll do my best to paraphrase here.  Basically I've been moving from place to place for about 2-3 years now and every 1-3 months I tend to go a bit off the rails; paranoia, delusions or heavily isolate (and I mean heavily).   Which in turn either gets me asked to leave or I do it myself cause I'm so uncomfortable with the place.  I don't have a history of violence or harassment, I just usually am too stressful because of the intensity of what Im dealing with.  I think most people just want a normal roommate , less stress and more predictable. 

Anyways, any thoughts on what to do for housing for someone who is mentally ill?  Are there ways or strategies to mitigate problems and remain safe?    


 Unfortunately staying with family is not a option and money is quiet tight.  I've applied for the programs that are available to me , but the waiting lists are long.  I worry about renting another room somewhere because I dont want to repeat the past.  And living alone is equally as cumbersome because it turns into a 'echo' chamber for my negative thoughts.  Long term mental health facilities appear to be a thing of the past.  I have medicare a/b , not sure if that would help much.  Thank you very much for reading, any advice or thoughts is greatly appreciated.  Hope you guys have a good day.

But it seems more and more like I just want to stay miserable, because it's just easier - even when the things I'm asked to do to get better (and which have helped in the past) aren't even such a big deal.

I guess a lot of it is just me rationalising my inaction, but those being my own thoughts, I can never really counter them effectively. And even when I'm doing pretty good, my base thought is always a hopeful 'maybe I'll die', and not in a bad way...

My mom died three years ago after a nasty battle with cancer, substance abuse, and personality disorder stuff. Now my dad is terminally ill. I recently flew back home because he was in the hospital and missed work for about five days. I came back and worked last week, but yesterday and today I’ve been sick with a virus and had to call out again. 

My boss was less than thrilled on the phone and chastised me about waiting until the last minute to call out (not entirely fair, since I was trying to pull myself together enough to be able to work) and for the past two hours I’ve been agonizing over it.

Why do I feel so guilty and horrible? I’m genuinely sick, and the week before last I had to deal with the stress of my father being possibly near death. Why am I more concerned about what my boss thinks of me, or letting my coworkers down? Why can’t I just accept that maybe I’m going through a hard time and responding in a reasonable way?

113,"I have no idea how to start this but I need advice, insight, help.. or a better therapist?

For context, I am a 33f and have been living on my own (with my son part-time) for about a year after fleeing an emotionally abusive ex. Medicated for BPD, depression, anxiety. BF is BPD also (not sure if diagnosed) but refuses to educate himself on the different aspects and facets of coping with having bpd and loving someone with bpd. He's been living with me for 3 months, pays his share and everything. Its mostly good. He can be encouraging and supportive at times, he can be very loving at times as well. But communication is (one of) our major issues. He is very easily irritated and angered. He gets manic often and will talk non-stop about stuff and he explains everything and goes into great detail about whatever subject he is speaking (more often than not he tends to talk about himself. He often talks about things that I do that he doesnt agree with or like, it feels like constant criticism to me. He wont just tell me whats bothering him, he spins off and tells me why he thinks im doing something in particular my reasons for it and whats wrong with me that makes me do it. If I attempt to join in on his conversation, about me or otherwise, he is often short with me, gets upset as if i am trying to cut him off, which we both admittedly have a problem with doing. He'll roll his eyes or exclaim ""oh my god"" if i say or do something that he doesn't understand or that doesn't make sense or is a stupid question. Or I'll ask something and he'll give me an annoyed look  and say stuff like ""let me talk"" or ""you don't get it"" or often just not acknowledge what I've said at all. If we're talking about feelings he'll ask me my thoughts or feelings and then after I've explained them he responds defensively and feels like I'm being unfair by feeling hurt or bothered, tells me that I'm emotionally manipulating him because it makes him feel bad/guilty when i bring up things that are an issue for me. We have very different communication styles and he is quite a selfish person. He says that he doesn't try or intend to react or act these ways and that he's sorry for being grumpy and never intends to make me feel badly for expressing myself. Yet he repeatedly does the same things. I get upset and we argue and it goes nowhere so i try and stop it and take time and space to think and reflect and he calls me immature and a child and a drama queen for this. That I just enjoy stretching out the fights as long as possible and i must enjoy making him feel bad. He doesnt try to respect my need for quiet and peace and introspection after even mild confrontation. I know I don't cope with my emotions well, but i feel like its impossible to speak to him at this point. It always turns into an argument and he already thinks everything i say is argumentative which I've been trying to figure out and fix but i don't understand how I'm coming off as argumentative so i don't know how to fix it. Its like I just have to shut down apologize and make him feel like he's right before he'll stop being confrontational and stop trying to make me stay and continue fighting instead of letting me take a time out like every issue needs to come to a solution within an hour or I'm ridiculous and a drama queen and just blowing things out of proportion. 

I am so fucking emotionally confused and I feel isolated and worthless and I don't know what to do. I'm not trying to paint him in a negative way either. I love him and he can be super great and sweet but the stuff that isn't great kills me. He's not very sensitive to others feelings or experiences, he is rarely affectionate, there's a severe lack of any kind of intimacy, i don't feel like i can open up to him I don't feel like I can approach him for physical or emotional intimacy or affection. But when I bring anything up he blames his mental health and brushes it off as the way he is and says it comes  from a place of caring but he says he'll try harder and that he loves me so much and I'm just spiraling in my head unable to figure out what to  feel or say or do. I feel crazy and I don't know how to begin to find solutions cause I'm convinced I actually am the problem.

I'm far from perfect and I have my issues for sure but I feel like I don't criticize or judge or call him out on the poor choices he makes every day.  I feel helpless. I want to tell  him to fuck off and leave but at the same time i love him and feel like maybe its just my fault and I need to be a better person. 

Can't do anything right. So I'll just go left. Right?

That process involved talking to a couple of people working in that field and I had to explain what was going on. In every instance, I cried the first time I talk to them and was physically incapable of stopping myself from crying. As much as I tried to hold it down, I couldn't.

For once my mind isn't telling me they're just pretending, or focusing only on the potential problems. I'm feeling mostly confident about myself. On top of all this, I worked with a girl who I might actually have a chance with and I'm just allowing myself to accept that.

That's it. Thank you universe, because I haven't felt like this in a very long time. I know it might be over in a few hours so I'm just going to enjoy it while it lasts, but boy am I enjoying this.",30Oct2019,45

135,"Hello everyone!

My name is MrGrompo, I'm a 26 years old male, if that helps.

I'm not sure if this is the right sub but I'll just go ahead and get this off my chest.

There are several issues I'm struggling with right now.

Procrastination: 

This is the biggest one at the moment but it's been haunting me for years now. I need to pay bills, look for a job, clean up my room, study for school, see a doctor etc., the list goes on. Yet I do nothing apart from playing video games all day, which brings us to the next point.

Excessive video gaming:

I've been playing computer games almost all day long since saturday(currently on vacation) despite the things I have to take care of. In the summer holidays I spent weeks playing all day long. I'm afraid I might have a video game addiction?

It's clearly gotten out of hand.

Another thing that's bothering me is...

Self-neglect:

This one is rather embarrassing but i don't even brush my teeth or take a shower every day. My room is a horrible mess.

Atrocious.

I should see a doctor because there's something wrong with my feet but I've been ignoring that as well.

On top of that I am neglecting social contacts, the last time I visited my friend was three months ago.

I am hiding at home and have barely any contact with anyone except my mom and my siblings.

I'm not in a good state right now.

I am currently in therapy and on medication(one anti-depressant and two different antipsychotics) but I'm starting to think that neither of these things are working.

In the last four to five years I've been in the psych ward twice for a couple of months each time and I've been seeing several therapists and four different psychiatrist.

I've been diagnosed with borderline-personality disorder twice, with depression even more often than that and once with

schizotypal personality disorder and I have been through several tests with no clear outcome.

I have no idea what my actual illness or disorder really is, if I even have one, but I am sure there is some underlying issue.

I know there is something wrong with me but I just can't figure out what it is.

Anyways, thanks for reading!",30Oct2019,1

I’ve been to a therapist and everything, and I got “diagnosed”; they handed me a paper with some results from what I filled in earlier, and it said that there are enough symptoms of a persistent depressive disorder and that they also see symptoms of borderline personality disorder.

Our relationship is going smoothly, but she does want to open to me more about her real problems, but  is unable to as she finds it hard to share this stuff. She probably thinks that she is not comfortable enough to share this.

141,"Two years ago I started seeing a low-income therapist at a women’s center because I felt my self-harm and depression was unbearable. It was the worst decision of my life and I regret ever seeking help. If I could give myself in the past instructions I’d tell myself to never go to a therapist.

So that December I was committed to a psych hospital and missed playing the Nutcracker which was my literal dream to play which I had been excited about for months and since I was a little kid. My relationship with my mom was ruined.

I was put on medication that caused severe genital numbing. I couldn’t feel my genitals at all. I would have to rub myself to the point it physically hurt. My sexual function has never fully returned.
Another medication I was in caused me to start having seizures. I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I was pulled off the medication and went through withdrawals and brain zaps.


Then, I was hospitalized again and forced into residential care for months against my will in a different state. There, I was hospitalized again and it was the worst experience of my life which left me with symptoms of PTSD. Residential care was horrific. They completely controlled you in every way. You were literally locked inside all day. No phones and no internet. Forced group therapy participation. When you went to a drug store once a week you were only allowed under 20 dollars and everything you wanted had to be listed and approved. I wasn’t approved for magazines a few times. The only things to read were trashy novels at the drug store. I missed a year of college and orchestra. All of my friends realized they were better off without me and no longer speak to me. One friend was upset I was so angry and bitter from what happened to me and left. There’s more stuff I could talk about, but what’s the point.


My life isn’t any better after getting “help”. I have all the same problems as before except now I’m angry, traumatized, broken, alone, and bitter. All my relationships with my friends and smiley are destroyed. I regret ever having seen a therapist. I regret trying to have gotten “help.” I wish I never sought out psychological “help” in the first place. My life would be so much better if I never got “treatment.” Seeing that therapist is the biggest regret of my entire life.",30Oct2019,3

144,"Narcissists can drive us crazy.

Still, there is something about them that makes us think, “I wish I were that confident, too.”

You are about to learn the real secret to their outrageous self-confidence and happiness.

It boils down to 5 characteristics of a narcissist that everyone must cultivate.

&amp;#x200B;

If you prefer watching to reading, here's a link to a quick video that I recorded:

[https://youtu.be/Sq973bmbbxE](https://youtu.be/Sq973bmbbxE)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a cousin who is a narcissist.

Although he can be a nuisance, he’s also a role model of positive traits of a narcissist for me.

I observed him and cultivated those traits in myself, without taking them to extremes as he does.

And they changed my life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Characteristic of a narcissist #1: Loving ourselves**

My cousin loves himself a lot.

For example, he sleeps 10 hours every night.

He also pampers himself with things such as tanning or massage. 

I don’t do that enough because I am all about productivity and results.

I put too much pressure on myself and need to love myself more as he does.

Why is it good?

Because it helps me feel good all the time and not just at those times when I am super productive.

As a result, I feel better, I relax more, I’m happier and healthier.

Here is a quote from Louise Hay:

&gt;“There is only one thing that heals every problem, and that is: to know how to love yourself.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Characteristic of a narcissist #2: Healthy self-esteem**

Another characteristic that I see a lot in my cousin is thinking high of himself.

For example, he has very high standards for women that he meets.

They must be gorgeous, smart, and successful. Wow!

He trained himself to believe that he is worthy of a high-quality woman.

And he is not afraid of gorgeous women as a result.

When he sees one, he goes right up to her and chats her up.

A great role model for people like me who are more introverted and shy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Characteristic of a narcissist #3: Setting boundaries**

My cousin loves saying no to people.

And he enjoys observing and soaking in their reaction.

It’s deeply satisfying to honor our priorities instead of letting others take advantage of us.

I need to do this more often.

I love helping people too much and sometimes do that to the detriment of my own priorities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Characteristic of a narcissist #4: Unlearning to compare ourselves to others**

My cousin never compares himself to others.

He is in a league of his own. 

That’s one characteristic of a narcissist that we just can’t overdo.

See, most unhappiness in life comes from comparisons.

We compare ourselves to neighbors, movie stars, and our ideal selves (“I should’ve been better”).

But it’s a rat race really.

What happens when we get what we want?

We aren’t happy.

We don’t have the time for that because we immediately set our eyes on the next target.

I’d rather sing the song that my cousin sings to himself: “Nothing compares to you.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Characteristic of a narcissist #5: Detachment from outcome**

My cousin always does what he wants and he couldn’t care less about failure or rejection.

He thinks that he shares his gift with the Universe.

When he doesn’t get what he wants, he thinks, “Well, too bad for them. They don’t know what they are missing.”

For me, being detached from the outcome like this is a great role model for killing my fear of rejection.

I just do my thing, my very best, and look at the result almost indifferently.

Actionable tip: cultivate these character traits of a narcissist

Do you have a narcissist in your life?

Look who is lucky here!

Use them as a role model.

Observe them for these 5 characteristics of a narcissist.

And cultivate them in yourself in a positive way.",30Oct2019,3

148,"I decided to reach out to my PCP and try to bring up that I want to see a psychiatrist. I keep having periods where I want to go away. But also where I dont feel like anything? It's kind of whatever. I grew up being mentally and physically abused by my grandma, but she moved away a long time ago. My parents always fought and it was physical sometimes. My dad is an angry person. My siblings and I grew up taking care of each other. My oldest sister left to join the convent because she couldnt take it anymore. My other sister is moving out soon because she cant stand my face. She said she felt betrayed I didnt tell her about my feelings and that I substance abused. My mom and dad doesnt believe in being sad. My brother cried when he saw me in the morning yesterday sobbing. Monday night I didnt sleep, and had a meltdown where I couldnt breathe, uncontrollably crying, nauseous, and shaking. My cousin helped me cause I needed to frantically type my thoughts out. I made a doctor's appointment because I wanted to go away. I planned something like 2 months ago but my friends persuaded me. Maybe I do want to live idk. But right now I oddly feel nothing. I'm not sad. I just dont feel anything. Idk if I want help anymore. I dont want to talk to anyone. I'm only going cause everyone said they're worried and want me to go.

150,"I have these episodes where I lose it, maybe it's a panic attack or something. I don't know how to describe it very well. I have tried using CBT techniques and used to work with a therapist on that which helped a little with day to day stuff but I don't recognize when these episodes start and I don't feel like I'm present enough to work through them when they do.

Last night was one of them. I was supposed to be on this show and I left before I was set to go on stage. I don't remember what happened to set me off. I remember being a little anxious when I got there but then I just snapped and I felt like I lost gravity or something. I didn't feel in control of myself or that I was in my body. I stopped processing where I was. I was just in this dark space with a bunch of people I didn't really recognize. Then I left.

A lot of the people that were on this show are people I've known for awhile but I didn't feel like I knew them any more. I don't know if it didn't seem like the same people or I just don't believe I knew who they were to begin with. I thought that they were against me, that there was some kind of plot. I don't remember. It all feels kind of like a dream now and doesn't make sense.

I don't really remember walking home, and when I got home I just remember feeling like something was scraping the inside of my head. I felt so low. I wanted to hurt myself but I didn't even feel in control enough to do that. I don't remember sleeping but I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up this morning. I don't feel great, I don't think I can leave my house but I'm better and I know if I work on it I'll be fine. This is actually one of the more mild and thankfully quicker times this has happened to me, but it's still really scary. I've lost days at my worst. I didn't take drugs or drink anything. I've had this happen before, maybe once a year or so. I keep derailing my life over these things. I've lost jobs because I no call no show or walk out entirely, lost opportunities because I'm not dependable, and relationships because people can't take the strain.

151,"I'm not sure how to word this, but I'm afraid to let go of my childhood.

I feel like every part of college right now is torturous and degrading on my sanity, and I cant get an appointment in the psychologist center because of the backup from all of the ""depressed"" students. I feel as though no matter how hard I try and how much progress I think I'm making, I will still fail, and I feel nothing but hatred for myself and anyone else who has helped me develop this sense of hopelessness.

153,"I am not sure if this is appropriate for this sub, if not please let me know! Sorry because its going to be a mess

A friend of mine's (F24) mother (late 60s) recently died suddenly (or so she says) and she is acting really strange. First she was telling us that her dad is being really selfish, controlling and making the death about him (she says he was looking through her moms bank statements and going through her things) which is normal for a husband to do, but she was acting like her dad is being conniving and trying to steal her mother's things.

Then she said her father is yelling at her and is being ""abusive"" towards her, and he was being abusive to her mother 2 months before she passed. When I ask her what does he do she basically said they argue (like any couple do). thats not abuse its just an argument. When i try to tell her that she says she has to go and arrange things for her mother's death.

Then she said her father is trying to poison her because he keeps asking her if she ate or not. When any of us ask her how, where, and with what poison. AGAIN she says she has to go because she has to move out because her father's abuse is too much.

Then she said her dad took all her others gold and wont give her, her share. But then 2 hours later when i asked if she needs help she laughed and said she it fine she has some gold her mother gave her and she can sell it for money.

Then she says she is scared and needs money ASAP cuz she needs to leave the house. AND when we asked why, she said she thinks her brother(M18) is going to rape her, when i asked why do you feel like that; she said ""he keeps staring at me weird and looking at my chest"". Her brother is 18 and never showed any kind of signs of being wacked. He plays video games and goes to school pretty much and never was violent. I asked her more about it and again she said she had to go to find somewhere to stay.

When her mother died I offered to help with the funeral costs, and some other of my friends wanted to help her get a place (because we thought her father was acting crazy from the things she says) but now we are not sure she should. Since she's been lying so much and making huge dangerous claims against her family, we don't think she should be alone.

&amp;#x200B;

This all happened in the span of 4 days. (she said way more things, too much to get into)

she said her parents don't have a joint bank account, now she is saying they do and her dad is holding the money and gold and all her mothers possessions. Then she said she is going to go sort her mothers clothing and room. 

More about her, these lies are not new, she usually lies on the daily about her life to make it more interesting. Like if one of us gets asked out all of a sudden the same happened to her, she even said her students try to grope her breasts and asked her out when she had an internship at a school (9th graders). She says she was engaged to someone a few years back when we didn't know her, only for her to admit it was only a crush she had after we pressed her about it. She has never been in a relationship but every once in a while she makes something up to about a past experience she had.

When ever we are talking sometimes she brings up something about abuse to make us feel bad or stop questioning the validity of her story. Or If i ask my friends something totally random she jumps out saying I insulted her family and i was trying to make a point by asking that question and she is hurt, because her great aunt went through that and how dare we talk about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I talked to her and from what it seems she wants all her mother's gold and is throwing a fit and trying to make it seem like she is being abused at home and even accusing her brother of wanting to rape her!

157,"So I suffer from anxiety, wouldn't be surprised if depression was in play too since I have a genetic predisposition to it on my mom and dad's side. I started going to a therapist in recent years and that has helped, but he insisted I try meditating. It sort of helped, but I just could not focus and I would still find myself in ""down"" periods despite habitual mediation. At one point, I even felt worse with more regular mediation. It also would not get me out of down or negative feelings. Recently when I was feeling pretty down and dark, I was playing with my two daughters who were coloring. They asked me to draw a pink and a purple Yoshi from Mario. After drawing those pictures, it was like my negative feelings were instantly gone and I felt so much better. Because of that experience, I purchased a sketch book and colored pencils, and just starting drawing pictures. So far for me personally, I felt it to be a very good alternative to meditation (one may make the case drawing is meditation). I am able to focus on the details of the sketch I am working on and disconnect. I was curious if others had a similar experience.

&amp;#x200B;

As a disclosure - I am not diminishing the power of meditation to many, it simply wasn't working for me.",30Oct2019,1
158,"I have bipolar so what might work for me may not for other people who have other disorders.

A few years after HS I decided I wanted to go to college. I picked a Southern State that had a good community college tie in with the University system. At first I was still miserable, being nearly silent in school, but then I decided to do comedy open mics and found I was really good at it and it gave me a much needed boost of confidence as well as giving my friends something to do...come to bars and watch me fuck with words to make people laugh. I started getting paid a few months in but most of my sets were still for free at mics and always were. I sorta stagnated at a point and decided I was going to talk about mental illness. All the comics were somewhat depressive and often had substance issues (like me). People were seeing me doing what I loved the most so to hear me talk so candidly and also deliberantly irreverently about stuff like getting dragged into mental hospitals. Tied down and shot up with sedatives and stuff about suicide, wholly making a cariacture out of my issues and not giving people appropriate context often came as a shock to them and they often would laugh. Sometimes people would be uncomfortable either because they didn't want to laugh at me or because I was a nutty person playing up how nuts I was, and having a good time doing it. It worked way better than it should have and was probably what jolted me back to life after a few years of darkness.

So as all this was going on I was getting my Associates and moving up to the university. I didn't like the University at first. People seemed so bratty and childish while the CC was more blue collar and about getting work done. But I'd always been a good student and had a good group of friends. Gilfriend etc. I was very quiet at school.

When my relationship started going downhill, and I was dealing with a lot of shit, I had the worst professor in a 3hr discussion class, where nobody wanted to talk. Because I was a natural class clown I would debate and shit talk this guy both seriously and using humor. The relationship ended in shambles but I had definitely made an impression and I did so without realizing it. I genuinely didn't care what my class mates were like and this joke splattered bravado, coupled with not caring if I looked crazy, as well as being legitimately funny, made people want to get to know me.

At the smoking section, a girl I would end up dating basically started telling me about a hospitalization and being bipolar, without me having ever spoken to her. I was playing the character, while also being bipolar, so I signaled it to other people with mental health issues. I still was very introverted and cool with that, and didn't have room for too many friends, but I would make room for female fixer-uppers for a couple reasons: Obviously the sex/dating angle but also because I genuinely prefer the company of women because they are always nicer to guys, than guys are to guys.

So jump cut to recently, after graduating, moving somewhere I didn't know anyone, bombing out of a good job and working several crappy jobs, and quitting drinking (though still taking drugs) the depression was getting worse n worse until when working, it dawned on me to 

Just. Go. Crazy.

I decided to tell anyone about bipolar as well as joke and play it up in the way familiar to me. My conversations in this form always have a keen focus on comedic timing and nuances of language. I ended up dating her for a couple months and though it was a tough breakup, I know I can do this whenever I want and I will make it work for me. I do act like a normal person a lot of the time but really put an emphasis on my difference.

This isn't some sort of bullshit PUA shit. This IS a coping mechanism. But it is Central to my sense of self and me in my truest form when freest and unencumbered by any sort of social expectations, except to be fundamentally unexpected. To be supremely confident, or what Kanye West calls the ""Superpower.""

Now I took this well beyond it's logical extreme and it was only because I'd been doing this shit as an act for a few nights a week for a few years, without really expecting too much social success, let alone commercial success. I got way more of the former, less of the latter, and knew I couldn't be a pro.

This isn't without risk. I feel bad knowing I scared a couple people. Interestingly it was when working as a Journalist that I did this. Because I wanted to talk about the news and politics, and because they are considered fundamentally UNFUNNY, and because I don't back down from an argument, people saw an abrupt shift from being the ""funny"" guy to the ""angry"" guy, and I had already seemed unhinged, so I feel bad for that. Those people weren't willing to listen though. It isn't really my fault.

So be careful.

People are less judgmental than you think they are and this also heads off any gossip because you are in charge of your narrative and at least some elements should work for you. I project funny, fun, eccentricity and that's who I am a good deal of the time.

However that depressive side is always there and that's why it's hard to let people get too close to me. They see too much.

159,"So, I have a crush on a girl that i know from Youtube. Because of her i know that I'm not the only one with the mix of mental health issues I have. I know I'll never get to know her and my heart aches at the thought of that. I would love to be her friend, because everytime she tells about the ""weird"" or just unusual things she does I'm like ""omg, that's me"". Im 3 years younger than her so there isn't such a big age gap and if i would move to the same city she lives in (don't worry, i always wanted to live there when i was a kid, this isn't for her) there could be a chances of meeting her and becoming friend. I know it's farfetched and that it might not happen, but i need this hopeful thought to keep me going. I've just been to a event she was attending, and now that I'm going home i feel as if I'm leaving my ""happy"" me behind and the dark clouds are coming back. the struggle to get through the day without it being one of the countless bad ones is going to start again. While i was away i set a goal for myself to someday drink thea with her and make her something to eat. I'm also planning on making a Youtube channel and do all kinds of video's because my job is crushing me mentally. I hope that one day I'll find a person like her that knows how it's like to be so sad, mad and have such dark thoughts. My friends always try to understand it but you dont know what it's like if you haven't experienced it.

Now I'm a little curious, does anyone know who I'm talking about?",30Oct2019,1
160,"Feeling shit because people who are supposed to help me always end up telling me I'm a screw up anyways. Happened again last week with my PT and I haven't been able to shake it off. I was proud of myself. I've lost 30lbs. And she told me I wasn't doing good enough. I worked my ass off for that. Gave up all my favorite foods and everything. My best still isn't good enough.

I've had this happen so many times throughout my life. Psychiatrists who told me I wasn't putting in enough effort to get better. Some who just flat out didn't believe anything I said. Teachers who took the bully's side because they were popular. Family that yelled at me because I struggled with social interaction.

In short, every time I start to trust someone they straight up destroy my self confidence again. I'm tired of it. It's getting harder and harder to trust people and all of my motivation to get healthy has gone. If I'm going to be told I look like crap anyways then why bother trying?",30Oct2019,0
161,"I've been depressed for so long that I don't remember not being depressed. Lately though, like the past year, I've been so unmotivated to do anything.

I want to sing, I want to draw, I want to do all these things that l have interest in but I just can't be bothered. I feel so tired the majority of the time and when I think about doing the things I want to do, I think what's the point and just go to bed.

I don't have a job anymore. I left it a month ago because my anxiety was getting too bad. I have no friends. The only people I interact with are my immediate family at home.

I struggle with my personal hygiene and my diet. I'm at my heaviest weight I've ever been at 84kg.

I'm just going through the motions everyday but the majority of the day I will sleep.

I'm hesitant to see a psychologist again because every time I've had one they haven't helped at all. They don't work on my problems, they just tell me to think of positive things and do breathing exercises.

I'm so lost and I don't know what to do.

At this point I feel like I'm never going to get better.",30Oct2019,1
162,"So, for a few days ive been feeling oddly excited, perhaps extreme. These feelings were piling up until today, where as i was sitting smoking a cig in my balcony, i suddenly had an EXTREME urge to fiddle with my hands. I started doing that until it got out of control and i had thoughts of ripping my skin out of my hands. I had a lot of trouble to properly think after that, then after a few minutes i was feeling perfectly fine. I do not know what happened, but i was talking abbout how i was feeling with my ex, and it was during this conversation that i felt like simply tuning out. I was also thinking that maybe i forced myself somehow to have this kind of episode happen to me, and now in this moment i think that every single thing that happened was simply a lie, a mere fabrication of my putrid self trying to convince me that i{m crazy. I normally dont feel like this, but i guess it has happened before. I have a history with anxiousness, panic attacks and anger issues as well. WOuld love some help, i just want to understand why am i acting like this and why has it happened before. This episode also happened today. It happened an hour ago",30Oct2019,1

165,"This might be a bit of a vent but I'm 17. When I was a kid I should probably mention that I was bullied in middle school and had a ton of suicidal thoughts daily and attempted self harm a few times. When I graduated middle school the bullying stopped and I was usually fine after but I never forgot about what happened. It's haunted me for years and I think I'm starting to come to terms with it but my self esteem keeps decreasing every day. It's become little things like saying hi to people the wrong way makes me think I'm disgusting or worthless for not being able to do simple things and a part of me has begun isolating myself. I know it's an issue and I know I might not be completely normal but because of my age, I just assumed it was teen angst and just tried my best to deal with it. But now I began to have alot of suicidal thoughts lately. I keep imagining jumping out in front of a car or taking too many pills and the feeling is sometimes relieving to think about but scary when I think about how other people will respond. I guess I should maybe mention one time I had chest pain and foolishly thought I was having a heart attack and I felt really disgusted at the thought of my family having a funeral for me and saying nice things about someone as gross as me so that's the reason I wouldn't go through with actually ending my life. I think these types of things alot but I don't know why I do. My life seems completely fine in regards to school and family but I just feel bored or hate myself all the time. It's mainly what I feel nowadays. I don't want to say I have depression because I don't think I do. I do have social anxiety though. (Diagnosed) And my lack of socializing is making me feel worse and hate myself more by the day. I used to also have therapy (for social anxiety) at the age of 12-16 but I didn't like having to go and didn't like my therapist/didn't like talking about my emotions so I faked being fine and having friends. Because of this and the budget cuts to my state, I don't have a therapist anymore and since I always complained as a kid about therapy I would feel insanely ashamed to admit that now I might need it. I know I'm thinking unhealthy things and most people say to get help if you think stuff like this but I don't want to waste a doctor's time if it's just teen angst and I don't want my family to think differently of me and try hard to act nice out of pity. My parents are already overprotective enough too. They wouldn't let me do anything on my own if they knew I thought these things. So now I'm wondering if the way I act might mean that I need to see a doctor or therapist or maybe It's just teen angst and I'm being a classic edgy teenager. I can't tell but I'll say for now in case anyone worries that I don't plan on taking my life or harming myself. Because besides hating myself, I don't think It'd do me or anyone else any good. I just think about it constantly and don't know if that's a problem or not. I don't want to seem like that toxic self diagnosing stereotype but I just want to know what I should do or can do to stop feeling like this all the time. Sorry this was so long but If anyone read this, thank you for taking the time to.",30Oct2019,1

168,"I've noticed a pattern since I graduated college, I have been getting depressed after I settle in to a new job and it's no longer new or challenging for me. I get depressed having basically the same routine all the time. Changing jobs helps for a bit but its not a lasting fix and its obviously bad for my resume if I do it too frequently.

I didnt feel this way so much in college because each quarter was different. I had different classes, a different schedule, different assignments. 

The thought of doing this for the rest of my life, having the same routine eventually no matter what I fall into, really sucks. I try to do activities I enjoy and teach myself new things so I feel like I'm moving forward and not stagnant in life but it only seems to take the edge off. I still hate doing almost the same things week after week.

For anyone that doesn't know what that is, it's basically one of the greatest joys you can experience in sports. About 2 weeks ago though, I stopped caring and I fell into a depressive state. I have improved upon fixing that depression, and I've been pretty successful. I'm a die hard sports fan so if my team wins I'm ecstatic, and my team has never made it this far. However even after I started becoming less depressed, I still don't feel any emotions towards them. It's like my brain could care less if they won or lost.

172,"Hello, I have a feeling in my life that everything is overwhelming and that I just want to end it all but just dont know how.

I am 17 year old student living in Sarajevo, living in not really good circumstances as home finance goes and my parents fighting like non stop. As far as I can remember I was the unloved one, the loser in school, at home, my grades bad, I went to a shitty elementary school where I was the most hated one, went into lots of fights and arguments with professors. Started smoking cigarettes in eight grade or when I was 14, then in the ninth grade I was spending a lot of time with a girl which later resulted in marijuana smoking.

So then I told my mom everything how far I can remember it was late 2016, she was shocked but allowed me to smoke a cigarette then and now. As 2017 began and winter vacation ended school started again, and slowly I started smoking weed again. My mom got a job in Croatia and went away for the next few months. I ended the ninth grade with bad grades but still I could get into arts school where I had a crush and a lot of friends. But my father careless how he is putted me in technical high school. That was like a break for me I cried for like days and wanted to die. Anyway I got somehow over it and got thoughts that I could become a criminal and flee away, so I started making bad friends, really bad friends. Did speed and weed, and a little bit after that started selling weed to finance myself. I remember that I smoked like 2 packs of cigs a day and drank a lot during that time. As time passed, and the date when my mother was going to come back got closer and closer I wanted to get out of the ""game"". So I sold almost everything before she was back. When she came it was like a shock to me so the day after she came I sold everything I had for little. School began, me still smoking dope and getting badder and badder grades, I figured out that I need to stop, so I told everything to my mom.

She was shocked and I think that she is never looking with the same eyes at me again. So i weaned off dope and the year 2018 began, for some reason I was really really depressed and didn't go to school, of course without my parents knowing. I was again with those bad friends but I wasn't using drugs, I wanted to make a criminal organisation, make money and flee away. Of course I didn't succeeded, my parents got a call from school and I was forced to go to school and make my grades better, I did, I went through the first grade of high school. Then summer vacation began and primarily I was lonely, sitting in front of my computer most of the time. Second grade began and I had sudden boost of energy and love for school and went through second grade as a airplane with an A grade or 5. 

2019 summer vacation began, I was happy, my parents were happy, I had nice friends, weaned off the bad ones, and living just nice. As summer vacation ended I felt depressed, sad, restless, even scared for some reason. And the third grade of high school started but I wasn't interested, somehow even began to be scared from people for no reason. I managed to keep my grades somewhere in between and talked to my mom that maybe I should go to a psychologist. But my father was against, anyway against his will I went and the psychologist told me I had severe anxiety and deppression, and told me to go a  psychiatrist. So I did. Last week I was in her office for like 5 minutes and she told me to take diazepam 5 mg 3 times a day cuz she was busy and that I need to come back in Monday. So I did. My impression is that she was totally uninterested, just wanted to wean me off, the visit was durating like 15 minutes and she prescribed me to take:

Sertraline 50mg in the morning, Promazine 25 mg 3 times a day, and the same diazepam tablets if I feel stressed.

That was two days ago, so yesterday morning i took one tablet of setraline and promazine. And went to school, I felt great, nothing anymore worried me, I was gaining interest and love for school. But when I came home it hit me like rock, I just wanted to kill myself. So half conscious i took 3 promazines and 7 diazepams and feel to sleep. Today I woke up feeling like shit and took the sertraline and promazine and went to school, and decided not to take anymore tablets before I hear someones other opinion. 

I want to fix myself, to finally live happily and like all others, but i just cant i dont know what to do, I became aggressive, suicidal, hit my cat, hit myself, I just want everything to stop.

Thank you very much if you read my story and please leave a opinion if you can, im sorry because its so long but i just couldnt make it any shorter.",30Oct2019,1

I’ve been in and out of treatment places, individual therapists, psychiatrists,etc. Over these 8 long years (I’m 21 now) I’ve had 2 suicide attempts and I’m still somehow here. It’s very frustrating and discrediting because I have worked so hard to better myself. I had to withdraw from school AGAIN to get back on my feet. Never had a girlfriend, manipulated and taken advantage of by friends, and much more keeps me ruminating and I’m so old now. I’m exhausted at this point. I’ve always heard “it always gets worse before it gets better”. But will it ever get better? That’s how it feels in the present moment. I’m hoping at some point I can move on from my demons. But these next 10 years of my life are going to be the most important and I’m trying to brace myself once again like every year. I’ve never felt so uneasy in my life. I never like to give up, I just hope this work pays off. I really don’t deserve any of this. In this generation it’s difficult for people to understand what it’s like for me.

I'm a freshman at university and I usually want to be alone and hanging out with people sounds like a hassle to me, but at the same time me being alone makes me feel extra down. I wouldn't say 'depressed' because I don't feel any certain emotion on a daily basis aside from empty/emotionless. When I feel this way (most of the time), I don't do any of my homework and therefore I have a bunch of missed assignments and work that I'm procrastinating on. Some days I feel good for most of the day for no reason, I'll clean my room and be productive. I have these short term drastic mood changes and also long term ones.

189,"Lemme first apologize for the length. There's a tl;dr at the bottom if you care to skip this whole ass essay.

When I was in my teens-early 20's, I was--admittedly--a very needy, clingy girl who'd get way too attached, far too quickly to objectively shitty guys who made it abundantly clear they didn't care for me nearly as much as I cared for them. I used to dream of dating someone who felt as strongly about me as I did for them. I used to fall HARD, dudes.

 I met a guy who, at first, seemed like a godsend; he confessed he'd crushed on me from afar for years, that I was his dream girl, he wanted to spend every second together, I was flooded with affection &amp; compliments. It SEEMED amazing, but now, in hindsight, I understand that it was textbook love bombing--a tactic used by abusive partners to get you hooked--and, like all love bombing, it eventually gave way to increasingly alarming, abusive, toxic behavior. I spent two years walking on eggshells &amp; hoping it'd go back to how it'd been in the beginning. A pointless endeavor. The toxic, raging asshole was the real him, the honeymoon phase was an act. He knew I had low self worth, was desperate for validation &amp; was in a very vulnerable state when he met me, he was a calculating predator who controlled my life, manipulated me, lied, cheated, verbally abused &amp;, finally, physically abused me for years.

I spent 2 years single after we broke up, trying to collect myself, process what happened, learn to recognize &amp; heed red flags, etc, but I'd also developed INTENSE anxiety, like ""lost 50lbs in 3mo"" anxiety. The relationship deeply impacted my life.

When I met my next boyfriend, it was like the opposite. No honeymoon phase, no affection, no compliments (literally didn't compliment me even once in 6 years). We'd see each other once a week at most...and the thing was: I was fine with it. The idea of a deep romantic attachment felt emotionally exhausting. He was essentially my best friend with whom I had an exclusive sexual relationship, who I'd occasionally watch/laugh at Hellraiser movies with while eating trash delivery food. That worked for me. I loved him, I still love him, but I was never IN love with him. As bad as the previous relationship was, during the good times, I felt madly in love with my abusive ex.

I'm single yet again, this time because I simply couldn't be fucked to find the time to see my ex. I just...didn't care. I've been dating (eyooo, tinderrrr) &amp; it feels like I'm emotionally and spiritually incapable of developing a meaningful connection with anybody. I WANT to fall head over heels for someone, I crave the connection, but instead I just feel sort of hollow &amp; bored. I'll ghost people because the emotional aspect feels like a chore &amp; I'm not invested enough to giving them a proper goodbye.

I think the abusive relationship possibly gave me PTSD, SOME kind of trauma. I think, on some unconscious level, my brain decided ""you can avoid this ever happening again if you just close yourself off emotionally"". It feels like my emotions are running at half capacity as an involuntary defense mechanism and it uhhh sucks. It sucks not having meaningful, intimate connections, hell, I can't even develop them with friends anymore. I just want to be alone, but at the same time, it depresses the hell out of me.

Sorry. Just venting.

190,"Not sure if this is even mental health related but idk where else to post  
but also when it most commonly happens is when i'm having a bipolar upswing and I don't sleep and I go outside and I hear whispering or screams in the rain.

or when im doing fine sometimes i hear voices inside of peoples voices but not like I can understand what's being said more im looking around to see if anyone else is actually talking

or today when this dog was barking really loud the door bell kept going on and on but the person i was with wasn't reacting to it so i guess it probably didn't ring

maybe im just scared of developing psychosis too or maybe i have tinnitus  
i know hallucinating when you've just woken up is pretty normal but i cant find anyone talking about hearing sounds inside of other sounds",30Oct2019,3
191,"For quite a while back I've realized I've been feeling this strange urges to do things I absolutely don't want to, for instance, when I'm in the bus going to college and the window is open I feel this almost overpowering will to throw my phone through the window, I need my phone, I like my phone, I'm not angry, but I feel this urge and sometimes I think this feeling is going to win.

I've always felt this way in high places, like wanting to jump when I'm in a high building or something, and apparently more people feels this way, so I thought it was normal, but I've been experiencing more and more of those feelings with things that doesn't make any sense, like throwing my phone over the window.

What does that mean? Is there something I should worry about? Is this stress? I starting to get afraid.",30Oct2019,1
192,"For the last couple of months I've been feeling emotionless and numb. I don't think I'm sad, I go out with my friends, I joke around, I'm generally a positive person, but I just sort of lost interest in everything that I used to love and I feel tired most of the time for no particular reason which leads to some irregular sleeping patterns, for example sometimes I can only be awake for a couple of hours at most while on other days I don't feel tired at all. I don't really know how to explain it, but I also realized that I only feel emotions in the moment. For example, I had a fight with my mother recently about something and it made me really emotional for a couple of minutes I was sobbing and then as if some switch was pulled in my brain, I just stopped crying all of a sudden and I had this numb feeling and I just went to sleep. The same thing goes with my ability to feel affection for other people, I feel as though I only acknowledge another person emotionally if we are talking right now in this moment, but then I would go home and feel nothing for that person, even if it's someone I really care about like my friends and family. I used to be really sad last year and I would just cry all the time over one person, but now I'm over that person and I just don't feel anything for anyone. I know that this may seem normal, but really, I'm a type of a person who falls in and out of love quite easily and for me to not harbor any romantic feelings or even notice anyone for such a long time is just odd. I kinda miss being sad, however stupid that sounded. At least then I could say that what I felt was sadness. Concerning other aspects of my life, my relationship with friends and family is relatively normal, my grades are also okay and nothing happened to me that would make me feel this way. I'm mostly interested in the whole momentary emotions prospect. Does anyone know why could I possibly be feeling emotions in such a short term?",30Oct2019,3
193,"So it started with just general worry. After hanging with friends I would just..break down and cry. After I got home of course. Not in front of them. I would just feel as if I made a fool of myself. Like I'm the annoying one. The one people just..put up with. Like my friends don't really care about me. Even if I tell myself it isn't true, another part of me will just convince me I'm wrong. That all those negative thoughts really are true.
Then, I started having panic attacks. I used to only have them before halftime show performances with my high school band. I thought maybe I just had some performance anxiety. Nothing bigger. Then, they started occurring more often. They didn't only happen before performances anymore. It was almost a daily thing. The longest I could go without one was 2 days.
Then, I started not enjoying music at all anymore. The one thing that really made me happy stopped making me happy. I lost/am losing interest in doing it anymore. 
Now, it's still all of those things, but there's more. I'm losing motivation in school. I struggled today to do a simple assignment. I've been really tired. I've been procrastinating more and now I have lots of work due this Friday. I don't want to talk to people as much. I feel like I just annoy everyone. I just feel bummed out + stressed out all the time. My mother is working on getting me a therapist, but until then all I can do is deal with it and wait. 
Any advice? Any idea what might be causing me to feel this way? Or maybe I'm just fine and I'm overreacting to all of this. I don't know..",30Oct2019,2

195,"Kinda long, first post here

I don't know what's wrong with me but most of the time I'm a super relaxed person and I value patience with myself, other people and any situation. But sometimes I have moments(only lasting for maybe 40 seconds idk) of unjustifiable rage. 

Its not so much that I'm genuinely angry but when Im stressed and something super small tips me over the edge I cry, sometimes scream profanities and my whole body tenses up and I get racing thoughts (usually just ""dammit"" over and over) 

I thought maybe it was related to tic disorder since I was diagnosed with that a few years ago but that wouldn't cover the crying and the thoughts. None of my friends know about this and would probably never suspect this of me (the reason I haven't told them is because I never thought it could happen outside the house and I didn't think it was important) the only person who knows is my mother because she has seen it several times but it's weird bringing it up with her(I will if it gets worse)

the reason I'm posting is because it happened today at a party in the bathroom. It's the first time it's ever happened outside of the house and I would rather not get it in a more public setting. I've looked online and stuff but I can't find more than IED and I'm certain it's not that.",30Oct2019,1
196,"Hi! First of all, thank you for this community. I’m not diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, but I do struggle with occasional paranoia and delusions and this is one of the most active subreddits for people dealing with problems similar to mine.

Now ... Psychiatrists and doctors. What should I do? I’ve pretty much never been in contact with mental health services.

I get scared they’ll experiment on me. Or lock me up. I DO NOT want any medicine whatsoever, not unless it’s absolutely necessary and i’m completely disconnected to my sense of self and everyday life. But as it is now, i’m balancing, but doing it quite well thankyouverymuch.

For the past few years i’ve gone through periods if depression and apathy, interspersed with bone-deep paranoia and delusions. The usual stuff - i’m being spied on, “THEY” are out to get me, i’m being hacked by the neighbour, i’m being poisoned in a elaborate plot by a terrorist and other such fun stuff.

It is SHORT periods where I lose insight and it all becomes super real. Nowadays I mostly get it in the way of strong intrusive thoughts, and I kind of shrug it off mostly with a “might be true, but let’s just go on for a bit and choose not to act on that belief”, if you get me?

Like, a few months ago i had worms crawling around in my left eye. Felt real, but I checked in the mirror a few times and didn’t see anything when they crawled out. How probable are these worms? Should we go to the doctor, or carry on at home and see if it passes? I CHOSE not to freak out, and just carried on with the worms in my eye. It passed after like .. a week or so.

Now, I had one longer “break” with (consensus) reality, where I was God. Delusions of reference galore, where the universe tried to “trick” me into thinking wrong thoughts that would collapse all of reality. Everything became quite the exhausting play, where I desperately tried to hold onto not letting reality know I knew it knew I knew lmao

Anyway, that passed slowly and i reintegrated with my sense of self, although with a different view of reality that I still have to this day, that very much goes against the reductionist view that is the norm.

Anyway, It does not interfere with my life as a human though, not that much, but it’s there in the background and I still get that “the universe is communicating with me everything is a mirror of a mirror of a mirror, congruence upon congruence o shit-“

But you guys, I just shrug it off and play my part?

However, I naturally do not want a longer break with reality.

But my REAL REAL problem is apathy, inability to get things done and depression!!!

THAT is what gets in the way of my everyday life! And I’m just worried that if a doctor/psychiatrist gets involved, they’ll diagnose me with a psychotic-spectrum disorder and handwave away MY REAL problems as “negative symptoms” and pump me full of antipsychotics that will just make it all the more difficult.

The “positive” symptoms I can currently deal with. What I REALLY want help with is my depression and inability to just ... get going in life. I feel locked up in my own head, and I hate it.

Should I tell any psychiatrist all my symptoms, or should I focus on what I really want help with (inability to carry a task/apathy/anxiety/feel “locked in” in my own head.)? Any other advice? What is your experience wiith mental health-care?

Thank you all for reading this rambling text. Any feedback or just a hi is much appreciated ... Love to all of you!!",30Oct2019,2
197,"The title is worded a bit poorly I think. I always feel like I'm happier with the anticipation of something good rather than the good thing itself. An example being, I took time out of education for four years, I had to start from foundation classes and work my way up. The entire time I was obsessing about being at university and how happy I'd be when I finally get there, but I'm not. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress and I'm grateful for the opportunity but it just scares me because it makes me feel like I'm constantly fighting against suicidal thoughts and trying to cope just for a couple of days of ""yay I did it"" then the pride fades, the excitement fades and it's back to the usual feelings of hopelessness. It seems pointless and exhausting. I'm not naive enough to believe that the excitement would be ongoing but I thought it would at least make me feel a bit more content with myself or with life.

198,"So, I know it's a bit weird to ask complete strangers about this, but I want to get your opinions on what has become my life today..

There's a tl;dr at the end, because this will be long.

First things first, I have been having some real self trust and self-esteem issues ever since I was 7 or so. Their origin is unknown to me or my parents, they've been telling me I have been harsh on myself ever since then without knowing why.
It still happens today, heck it's not rare that when I do mistakes, I end up hitting my head on a wall or plant my fingernails into an arm or leg.

These mistakes often come from school, when I've failed a test (living in Europe), answered a question wrong or acted weird. About that, I'm also really awkward in public, always stuttering even when I know what I'm talking about. Again, no clue why.
People have been saying to me ""It's alright, no need to beat yourself up about it"" but most of the time I don't want to let these unpunished.

Though, that's not quite all.
Lately, my behaviour has been really weird : I tend to hit my head or scratch my arms (like someone with panic attacks) randomly, without any particular reason to. It helps me calm down, even if there's no danger or anything to be worried about.

And okay, this part is the one I'm more ashamed of, kinda why it's in the middle of this post. It's gonna sound absolutely emo, completely childish. Sorry...but if I want to get a honest opinion (and advice), I gotta talk about that.
I hate humans. I don't hate *you*, the one reading this, and I love my family and friends but I hate humanity as a whole, for plenty of reasons that'd take an entire post to tell. Yeah, you've heard this a thousand times already, probably.
Hence why I don't want to be human. So, my subconscious has been looking for other, well..non-human models, even if they're anthropomorphic.

..here comes the thing. I have been dreaming so, so much to go to another world. If you look at my comment history (and my profile picture if you're on the new Reddit), you'll easily guess where. Childish, ridiculous, call it the way you want, I do the same.
I'm fully aware it's impossible - heck, I've been repeating it to myself every single day - but I have been thinking about it a LOT over the past few years. I'd do anything to get there, even dedicate my life to working on physics if I needed to.
As I obviously can't get there by normal means, I've been thinking about the other means, i.e. *forcing myself* out of this world. I haven't done it (yet) because I love my family and friends too much, and I know it'd hurt them really bad.
In the meantime, I've been suffering. Imagine if you felt your dream life was millimeters away from you but you missed your chance. It's that feeling repeated multiple times a week when it's not multiple times a day.

And that's it, told you it'd be long. I know you've been internally judging while you've been reading this post, so please, tell me. If you have some advice for me to improve my mindset a bit, send it too. Thank you!

tl;dr: I'm hating myself and humanity, I want to get to a video game world or kill myself. Help.",30Oct2019,2

These past few days have obviously been rough for her because she has been telling me how she had been wanting to kill herself.

I really dont want to lose her. She means absolutely everything to me. I have lost a friend before to suicide and it hit me like a train. I still beat myself up for not being able to help enough.

201,"just a rant or ramble

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if its because im high functioning or because im not as expressive as some but i feel trapped in my situation at the moment. 

So where im from, they dont give out student loans and healthcare costs. my parents saved so much for me to get a good education and now im currently doing 2 posgraduate qualifications at the same time (still shocked at how this happened but what can i do?) and i feel like this is important for me getting a good job.

my parents (dad to be specific) has been ill for a long long time. he manages to mask it with a shit tonne of medication and supplements (and i feel like i do the same but  not even nearly as extreme as him). he has a bunch of health problems like diabetes, blood pressure problems, kidney stones, liver damage etc. but he is one of the most down to earth, kind, fun and understanding person i know. it makes it worse that he is sacrificing his health for our family and for me and my brother to have a good education. 

and we spoke about this, truthfully and heart to heart. he said that this is the only chance he has of supporting us in education/qualification. so i cannot mess this up. hes old and he will retire, or worse.... just reach his limit. so that is our background...

my issue is that im absolutely damaged. I can function but sometimes it goes away and I break down. and knowing that i am slacking makes it worse. 

I am so suicidal but i cannot just let my parents sacrifice all this for nothing. Plus, i need to get a good job to help support them. But because of my severe social anxiety and depression..... i dont know if i can. and to me that is devastating because they deserve someone who actually can help them. instead, they get this useless ball of illness. plus, fun fact, i also have a bunch of physical problems. right now, im alright but it took a toll on them when i was a young kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

they deserve so much better. so much more than i can ever give them.

so thats why i feel trapped. i feel so terrible with myself. i want it to end. but i cant. i cant even slack because its my duty to help them. to help others. but it hurts so much..

never been good at starting writing so I'll just dive in.

I sometimes feel as if I care far too much about how you feel about me to the point it can affect my mood or consume my thoughts until I know you don't dislike me, and my thoughts of being disliked seem to be amplified with you compared to others, perhaps partly because we mostly talk online and you already have plans to move away so I feel like it's easier for you to leave, as well as admiring you for how you could be so honest with your anxiety. I feel as if this leads to me constantly worrying about whether you actually like me and I guess(\\hope) I negativly interpret alot,and reccently I feel really confused as some things make me feel like you're annoyed or don't acctually like talking to me, such as I'll negativly interpret a tone, or the fact we're not talking for long periods most days in a xbox party as you not wanting to talk, even though I know I'm wrong because you join parties with just me in or you'll invite me to one if I don't invite you. Plus whilst I don't consider you the 'girl who has mental issues and self-harms', I worry not just about you, but how I'm helping, Am I bringing it up too much?, Am I letting stuff go that you want to talk about?, how do we help when you find feeling cared for and helped new and weird?, why can't I make you feel better about your self??, why can't you just feel as comfortable around me as I do with you? even though I know it's logical to not be closest to a person you've only been friends and not just aquintances with for a few months. All of this leads to what I really want to say, the conversation today, you managed to worry all of my fears, how you seemed to me off-put by me pushing for an answer when I wanted to know if you were alright the other night as you seemed strangly spaced out even though you don't drink or do drugs, made me worry I'm being over worried about you. You complaining almost a week later about me poking your sides to scare you whilst playing a horror game, was me being a dick (not your words, but what I felt you meant),since 'I know you don't like being touched' even though to me I thought you just didn't liked being hugged or patted (which I want to do sometimes to make you feel better but don't),and 'why the sides like its normal to just do the shoulders' when to me all I was doing was jokingly trying to scare you whilst playing a horror game, not being malicious in doing it in the worst place, just a thought that came to my head because it seemed funny. finally your comment about missing the time before we were friends where you could just talk to &lt;insert 3rd friend here&gt;, and how you've known him for 2 years and have a crush on him, makes me feel like I'm the 3rd wheel of the group to you and you'd love to be rid of me, but I'm there for &lt;insert 3rd friend here&gt;'s sake. When I initially heard this and felt annoyed, I tried to hide it because I don't hate you for saying it and I didn't want you to get the idea that I do.

I don't know which one too think, is me denying that maybe us being friends just isn't working that well just me again not wanting to be left by you or caring too much about helping you through a tough time, or is me thinking maybe I should just go me again just assuming that I'm disliked and being over negative because deep down I feel like I'm not good enough.",30Oct2019,1

212," 

So my dad has had a few girlfriends (now a wife) who had other kids and family.. obviously.

The problem I have with this, is not that I don't want my dad to be happy but it's been with every girlfriend and now his wife that they become more important than my biological sister and I. Like for example, it was my birthday Oct 4th and my dad was so set on seeing me that Friday and then all of a sudden my birthday rolls around and he can't make it because him and my step mom are babysitting my step sisters kid. I felt kind of upset over that but I tried to get over it. He had done something similar like this on my 16th bday when he was with his ex gf. Her and I shared the same birthday. They both gave me the choice to choose where I wanted to go for dinner, I chose. Then the day before I ask if we were still going and then he said oh i was thinking such and such for pizza. Not trying to be rude I was just like I thought you guys said I could choose. He then said ""fine, maybe your mother can take you"" Long story short, didn't see my dad at all for my 16th. Most recent birthday I turned 22.

Another instance is when I lived with my step mom in the UP and they had bought me a car from an alcoholic, presumably because I said I wanted to start working on cars, but soon this car was going to be my daily driver once I moved back to WI. This car was bought for 2k. I spent 900$ of my own money on fixing it, even had to open a new credit card to pay for the repairs and now I'm in even more debt on a car that only lasted 6 months and that my family and I had put over 2k into fixing it. But my dad said I should be grateful because it was a free car, despite me having to work my ass off in the UP to ""earn"" it without getting paid. Then he proceeded to fight tooth and nail to give me my original car back that I was letting my grandma use since at the time I didn't need one. Then my step brother needed a new car because his car took a shit on him. My step mom then proceeded to cosign a loan for him to get a 2019 nissan altima. Basically the same 2019 car she got my dad to buy her, just without the bells and whistles for him. When I confronted my dad about this, claimed he didn't cosign, and it was none of my business because I wasn't able to swing a 600$ car payment. Lets get one thing straight, I was not asking for a brand new car. I just wanted a reliable one because I drive a lot.

I guess what I'm getting at is that it seems like my dad's wife and her kids are always so much more important than my sister and I. It hurts me. I'm bad at confrontation and communication and even if I bring it up to him he will just spin it on me and make me sound like I'm being ungrateful. This doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how he treated me from 15-17 when he was with his psycho ex gf.",30Oct2019,1

The issue with this is that if i tried to ask my mom, she would probably just shrug it off and tell me its temporary and to stop complaining, etc. 

Ive done some research on a few conditions and of course i dont want to self-diagnose myself but BPD  seems to be pretty much spot on symptom wise. This whole thing is getting bad. I cant focus at all because i keep zoning out and i have went from an A-B student to a D-F student. I have some great friends but honestly half the time i wish i could just cut them all off and commit suicide to end this all because i dont want to feel like this forever. I feel like an empty pit that people get swallowed into. I put on a fake smile everyday but honestly i hate life and everything about it. Its all so fucked up and i feel completely lost.

To add on top of this, its my senior year and i have been accepted into my number 1 college which is about 3 hours away from everything i know. My family puts so much pressure on me to go to college that i cant tell them no.

So what i want to know is, is there any way i can get a diagnosis wothout my parents knowing? Once i got diagnosed i would tell them of course but id rather them not know about it prior.",30Oct2019,1
214,"I'm just so sick of my inner voice telling me constantly that I'm not good enough, that I only annoy people, that I'm a burden etc. For a long time she was quiet or just whispering. But since a week or two she screams so often. I'm trying to fight against her and not let her criticism overcome me but I'm just so tired. I'm in therapy and learnd some skills and they help but right now I just feel so lost with myself. (sorry for my bad english!)

Help

I’m 17, Male

I genuinely don’t know how to describe how I feel

There’s a voice, a feeling in the back of my mind, it undercuts everything genuine I feel. It wants to turn everything into this dramatized movie, and it’s always been there. It makes me feel like the way I present myself to everyone, the me everyone knows based on what I say and do is just an act, a puppet it uses. And I’ve always just thought that was the real me, which is horrible, but it never made me sad. But as time has gone on the feeling and its strange agenda have grown more and more different than the me I present, and I want it to go away. Everything genuine I feel is followed by the feeling that its all fake, none of it is real. All my friends who I see so often I’m told are just tricked into liking someone that isn’t me. But why do I want to trick them? Even the voice has no motive, no manipulation, do I just feel like I should have friends? And what if its not the real me? What if the me I present is me and the brief moments of genuine connection I feel when I talk to people about emotions and life are real unlike what I’m told by it moments after. Even as I type this now it tells me this is just part of the dramatic story I’m typing but Its not. Every time I give it an inch and let it tell me it is me and I’m fake I want to cry, and I often do, I am right now. I want it to stop, I have no way of knowing is that’s really then truth but as far as I know I want it gone. I call it a voice but its more of a feeling, it’s not distinctly separate from everything else I feel but I can identify its influence. How do I get rid of it, I need help, I want it out of me I want the mask it made to be me, I want to break free from it? I want to be genuine I want this to be me.",30Oct2019,2
217,"My parents won't let me get any help with my mental health. I've been googling how to get that help, but everything just says to talk to a school counselor. One big problem with that though: my grandmother runs my school(it's a shitty charter school) and we don't have a counselor that cares about mental health. 

Even if one of the teachers could try to get me some help, everything gets passed by my grandmother, so I guess the school is no dice. I think it's pretty urgent, but what the hell do I do?",30Oct2019,1
218,"For as long as I can remember I've never had an ability to picture images in my head, nor feeling my own emotions. It was confusing growing up but not hindering, I've never taken medications or had problems reading/ expressing emotion and not depressed. Life is great, cracking jokes, I love seeing people smile, loving friends and family but at the end of the day there's no memorable feeling, just an endless train of thought. 
Are we supposed to feel something?",30Oct2019,2
219,"I’m a 15 year old girl who has already been diagnosed with depression and PTSD caused by being mentally abused as a little kid, and I’ve recently been thinking I might also have OCD. I’m not trying to self-diagnose, but I’m wondering if these symptoms are worth checking out.
I have very specific eating habits. My food cannot be touching. If a tiny piece of lettuce touches my pasta or something I get very upset. I also have to eat it a certain order. I have to eat all of a certain food, then eat all of another food, I can’t take a bite of chicken then some stuffing, it has to be in order. And any sort of assorted food must be eaten in order (for example, I must eat Skittles in the order orange, green, purple, yellow, red). If my eating rituals get messed up, I almost can’t continue eating.
I also hate even numbers. I refuse to sit on even numbered seats on the bus and when eating food that comes in pieces (ex. pizza rolls or chicken nuggets) I must have an odd amount. This is a minor thing though
I also love forcing myself to do repetitive, tedious tasks, such as writing down the names of all my classmates or counting the number of songs in a long playlist, for no reason. I don’t even enjoy it, I just feel like I have to do it. Sometimes J don’t let myself do anything else until I finish it
I’m also a bit of a hoarder. I have drawers filled with stuff that is basically trash because I’m scare if I throw it away it will come to bite me in the ass. I keep homework from years ago in case I forget how to do math or something, or I keep a literal piece of trash like a gum wrapper because I have a fond memory ties to it.
I’ve also experienced intrusive thoughts for a little while and I don’t let my brother near me without washing his hands. These are some of the things that alarmed me. Would it be worth getting checked out. I have a fear of doctors so if it’s not that likely there’s something wrong I might not bother to get checked out",30Oct2019,4

221,"I’m sick of people who don’t have depression acting like they know what it’s like, and acting like they relate to not being able to function just because they have some sort or victim complex or like to be the centre of attention so just agree so that they can get back to talking about themselves faster.",30Oct2019,1
222,"I’m probably gonna have to check myself into psyche ward later this week.  Anyone know if there is a site that ranks the different psych wards, kind of like a yelp for psyche wards.

I’ve been to psyche in the past and some facilities are helpful but others are a nightmare so don’t want to go in blind.",30Oct2019,5
223,"A week ago was my birthday and the day after that a very close friend passed away.  Two years ago she was diagnosed with non-smallcell lung cancer.  She called me the night of my birthday to tell me she was beyond the point of no return.  She wanted to say goodbye and we did.  We cried and said we loved each other.  The next day I received a message from one of her friends, she had passed.  I knew this was coming ad it hurt none the less.  I know that I will recover, it's just hard right now.  Lots of things remind me of her, her smile, her laugh.  I just need people to know this.",30Oct2019,1
