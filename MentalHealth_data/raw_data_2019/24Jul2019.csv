1,"Trigger Warning- suicide

So this is my first post on Reddit. This isn’t intended to a “poor me” situation I don’t want sympathy I just want to talk about this to those who don’t know me personally and aren’t biased.
So I’m a 22 year old girl, I live in the midwest and I’ve struggled with mental illness basically my whole life. I hurt people because of it. I feel like sometimes I have no sympathy or remorse, but then I feel bad for not having it and the things I’ve done so others tell me I’m being too hard on myself. I still have a lot going for me, I’m a musician, I have a wonderful family and am in a 2 year serious relationship. The problem is no matter how much I try to better myself I always end up destructing others and everything good in my life. I don’t do this on purpose. I’ve been told I’m an “energy vampire”. At this point I feel like even existing just causes problems for everyone else. I’ll never feel unashamed of who I am and what I’ve done, so I feel like at this point my best option is to kill myself. I don’t actually think I’ll do it, which another reason I hate myself and feel stupid for even making this post. I wanna hear others thoughts and similar experiences, or not similar I’d love to hear any stories, with suicide. 
Thanks, hope everyone has a good day/night",24Jul2019,1
2,"I've always sorta known that my mood can quite radically change over the course of about 2-4 weeks, it's been happening as if it's like scheduled for the past about 2 years

However it's really started getting worse in the past couple of months

What I mean is that, for the most part, i tend to be happy, I enjoy things and care for others, but after a couple weeks of this, something changes in me, I want to say it happens over a couple days but recently it's happened over the course of a single day

When this happens I feel like another person, I no longer feel even remotely as much happiness, thoughts of depression flood my mind, and sometimes suicide

It feels as though my emotions, the good ones get locked away, while the bad ones get set loose across my mind

The things I say to even my closest friends seem so heartless, i hate myself for even doing it but i dont know why i dont just stop myself, it pains me to even think about but in these moments I genuinely feel above people I'm talking to

At it's worse I've just felt like a backseat driver, watching everything, unable to take control, while this horrible side of me rips my relationships with all my friends apart, I've already lost 3 friends because of how cruel I become, but everything I've said sounds so fake they wouldn't believe me, I wish I could apologise but they cut all connection with me, I've started to become scared of making new friends because I dont want to hurt anyone in the same way

After a couple days of this I slowly come back to normal, I feel like my emotions come back to me, and I'm able to care for others again, I've noticed soon after this happens I've had to go and apologise to most people for how horrible I am to them, and hope they forgive me, but at this point my apologies mean nothing because I know I'll do it again, and they've noticed too that I will

I'm just scared that something is seriously wrong with me, and I hope I can overcome whatever is happening to me before I do something to myself",24Jul2019,1
3,"So this happened like 5 minutes ago. we were laying in bed about to fall asleep when she suddenly starts to freak out and talk about shouting. something or someone shouting and everything kind of turning white. after calming her down she tells me she has been like this since she was little (she is almost 18 now) and that she has never told anyone about it before. She says she sometimes hears shouting that gets louder and louder or just talking that gets louder and louder. while this is happening she talks about things getting white.
I think it might be because of a traumatic fight her sister had with her parents when she was little that is surfacing but I honestly don't have a clue. I'm pretty worried about her and she says she has had them for so long and had them so frequently that she is used to it but is anxious about what is might be. Any idea?",24Jul2019,2
4,"Over the last few months we had a new woman join our team at work, and at first she seemed really nice. Seemed. It's come to light that actually, she's incredibly nasty and manipulative. She constantly bitches about everyone behind their back, tells lies about them, refuses to do our job correctly simply to pick a fight with our senior team members, and just causes drama after drama.

The way she talks and acts reminds me very much of my grandmother, a woman I cut contact with years ago because I was finished with her verbal, emotional, and mental abuse. That woman left me with horrible psychological scars that I've been working hard to heal for many years.

With the realisation that the woman at my work place shares eerie behavioral similarities with my grandmother, I've started having flashbacks and nightmares. I'm on anti depressants that usually work really well, however lately they're not effective at all. I'm not in a place for therapy just yet, but I'm getting there, and I intend on it very soon - I want to move out first so I actually have space to decompress alone after sessions, and I'll be moving out in the next month or so.

I was wondering if any of you have any advice you could share on how best to cope, and perhaps reduce these incidents.",24Jul2019,1
5,"Dear Ash, 

You appear to be at a turning point in your story.

You've been asleep for some time, under the cover of dark.

But I can see you there. You're finding your voice - I can feel it.

Please stay strong and stay kind to others. In this life, people will cross your path and leave a mark on you. These will be both loved ones and not so loved ones.

Just try your best to do the one thing that should be the easiest, but is arguably the most difficult.

BE YOURSELF.

I believe you're lost right now and actually since you've actively started looking for yourself, you feel more lost than ever because what you once thought you knew about yourself may actually not be true. So you're seeing yourself as more of a blank canvas. You find this scary.

Throughout this journey, please remember the people in your life whose lives you've touched and enriched. Remember, you have support around you and lots of people that love and care for you.

In the past four years, you've gone from one dramatic change to another. It comes as no surprise that these series of events have shaken your own perception of who you are, but I believe you're more well rounded than you even know and that the future that awaits you will shine an even greater spotlight on the Ash we've come to love.

In the meantime, just take care of him.

7,"Hey, reddit. First time really posting anywhere on here. I don't know where to begin, so I'll just start here:  


The past year has been my worst yet. I lived with my brother and since we REALLY do not get along, I've noticed some things wrong with my mental health. He put me through what I thought were mental breakdowns, but while I was doing them (collapsing on the floor, screaming), I felt like I was acting. Like I did it to get him off of my ass, since there is so much wrong with him, I can't fully explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back towards the end of winter of this year, I googled up symptoms of schizophrenia after feeling really anxious, with mood changes triggered by my brother's anger. These mood changes would then be easily triggered by something negative, and would ruin my whole day. The symptoms really started to fit (the negative ones, along with some cognitive.) I smoked weed since 14, took shrooms at 15 after my mother passed. Took 400 morning glory seeds (LSA) when I was 17 and had a horrifying trip. It didn't really scar me, but it taught me what true terror was. Then during some of the time worrying about schizophrenia (a couple months back), I did shrooms twice. Since the LSA trip, I've discovered if I stare at something long enough, not moving my eyes, my vision will change. Everything I am not focusing on will disappear or blend into the environment. It will look as if my field of vision was hit with a filter from photoshop. Some things will shrink and grow. I looked at a sign once that said ""God is in this home"" or something, and the Os would fill in black, or completely disappear. I can still do this. Recently, whenever I'm walking awhile and I'm a bit winded, I look at the ground, and it looks like the patterns in the ground are zooming in and out. But with both of these things, if i close my eyes if all goes away, until I keep staring. I wear glasses, so I'm not sure if its some problem with my eyes, or something mental I am 19 now, and trying to get into the navy, but I'm seeing that might not happen with the recent health problems

&amp;#x200B;

Around the time I lived with my brother, I withdrew from friends. I knew I could not keep a conversation going, because I lacked the care.

I slowly began to lose interest in all that I enjoyed. For a time, I kind of wanted schizophrenia, hoping I'd have it with some hope it would give me a unique creativity (how wrong I am.) That desire quickly went away. I had a flat face once after googling symptoms, but I think that was me forcing it. The whole time I felt like I was doing it to prove it to myself. It scared me when I looked up delusions as well. I felt I was close to a few. I'd look at someone and believe they could be the next influential person, but it was always on the standpoint that you never know you could pass by the next MLK or something. I never 100% believed me walking past someone was totally significant, but I thought it could've been the start of a delusion. Back when I was around 12, my mother thought God was talking to her, and that God was telling her we'd lead the end times. She grew out of it, though she was sick with liver disease at the time. We all wanted to believe her, yet knew in our hearts we couldn't. Although, she told me I'd be like John the Baptist. That was, and still kind of is one of my greatest desires. Doing something so great for God and people that it must be written down. I believed it on and off for a time, but always doubting it with a level head. Knowing it could always be untrue. Ill get to WHY that plays a big role.

&amp;#x200B;

The recent shroom trip was very uncomfortable, and fearful at the end. I kept listening to one song (Digital love by daft punk) on repeat, since it kept me from having another hellish trip. At the end, my brother woke up from his trip, saying he saw God (it scares me as well, since during the trip, his was going bad, and I prayed for God to help him). His trip was done, but mine was still going. I would just keep seeing hellish and insane faces whenever I'd open or close my eyes. I prayed to God, crying to him to come back into my life, saying I'd give up my life desires just to not go insane, since I had found that was my new greatest fear.

&amp;#x200B;

For awhile, felt like God definitely came back. I was feeling genuinely happier and hopeful. My brother and I have always been on end times shit since we were in high school, and I had got back into it again. I started to believe psychedelics were the fruits of knowledge. That I may have cracked the code to how to stop sin (not totally,) and that I may have been destined to be a saint. All the while I was doing this, I always doubted it. I'd need more evidence to believe it. I never fully did. I just believe since it was my greatest desire, I was convincing myself of it. I always kept an eye on that. Then at June 24th this year, when I was smoking with a friend, and I felt more high than usual. And we started to shoot the shit about the last time i had chilled at his place. I don't remember what I said (I have some memory problems as well), but I think I said ""That was the last day I was here, really,"" And he was freaked out after I said that. He swore I said ""that was the last day that was real to me."" I started to have an anxiety attack. I thought that was my psychotic break, that I was about to start hallucinating. I was shaking so much, and all hopeful attitude about God turned into pure fear of psychosis. Did I say that? If that was a hallucination, what else was? Was I having a delusion about God? Was this me in the prodome phase of schizophrenia? Later, my brother called me on the phone, and he was calling my name on the phone (John,) because I was listening, not talking. I swear I heard him say 'Jeremy"" ( a friend at the time I was trying to get in contact with again), but he says he never said it. I was stricken with more fear. In hindsight, I think he might've said ""D'ya hear me?"" It also gets me that the same time, since friend has a ghost in his house (from his experience, with witnesses), and it would screw with the TV in the basement whenever we'd play games. It would mess with the volume only when we'd play games on this certain TV, only in the basement. One day, I talked to it, having it use the volume meter as a yes/no indicator. It answered questions in specific detail. But it did not want to be put on film, which scares me. I am still wondering if I hallucinated that, yet my friend has had many paranormal experiences in that house. That experience i had was about a month before the anxiety attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since that anxiety attack, I've been so anxious and utterly terrified about developing this illness. My mind has been on the lookout for anything that could be a hallucination. Googling every symptom I could have. A lot of coincidences have been happening, and my mind would hook onto it and I'd think ""Is that real? Am I making connections where there are none? Is this the start of a delusion?"" A certain song would come on, and it would describe my situation, or I would be fearful that I'd think it would be speaking to me. The song wouldn't literally talk to me, but the song would eerily describe what I was going through at the time, and a certain line that would have to do with the mind or going crazy, I'd get so anxious about it being such a coincidence. I'd think I was believing it, when I wasn't, but I fear its the start of something. One day, I looked at a Rorschach, (one with the two men or women), and I read that it was a schizophrenic thing to see that it was two men beating the head of a woman, saying that what they said was a womans head did not look like one. I looked back at it, and saw a face in it. It still terrifies me to the point I don't want to look at it again. I'll just get flooded with thoughts of hallucinating. I'm nearly sure at this point that I have bad anxiety, and that the ghost thing may have been a ghost, but just bad luck I did that around the time I'm worrying about this. All of the possible delusions I've stated I've always doubted, and needed more proof if I was going to believe any of it. As of July 6th, I had moved back into my Gram's house from being homeless since 22nd of may. I stopped smoking shortly after that anxiety attack, with the fear if I kept smoking, I would bring on psychosis.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a logical person, don't get me wrong. Before I believe anything, I need total proof, and I can definitely be swayed if you have it. I have also had insight into what I've been going through recently, noticing that a lot of my fears were just anxiety overthinking everything. The other night, I swore I saw a shadowy dot in the corner of my eye, and disappeared when I looked at it. I know how reality works, I'm just worried that my mind will change to the point where I don't anymore. There is no way I could put everything on here. Maybe with some replies, I will share the rest. Please help, because this fear will not go away. I wake up with it, and go to bed with it. It's been improving during this last month, but I hope it won't be short lived before something else happens.",24Jul2019,1

To cut it short, i dont feel most emotions such as love for an example. and if I can feel something, its like its hiding behind a security mirror in an interrigation room. There are some emotions however wich i can notice far to well such as sadness, anger, fear, rage and an incredible amount of uncontrollable pure hate on everything and everyone. Specially this hate is allways with me. There are days wich it controlls every step i make and everything that i do. Sometimes im not able to feel my own body and my sense for danger is completely shut down. this leading to some dangerous events for my self and more importantly others. Things as self harm and suicidal thoughts are well known for me. On the other hand Im very percise on analysing what other people think or feel. Its almost as if i could read them like a book. Just for information: I am on medication and I do therapy. It's just that i don't make as much progress like i would want it to be. I know that i am probably part of this problem.

10,"This first little section is kind of just a little venting and explanation, you don't have to read through it if you don't care I guess.

The past few years of my life have been kind of rough for me. I feel like I've embarrassed myself at school beyond recovery and nobody likes or cares for me besides teachers. I am ahead by a year in school because I think my mom admitted me a year early yet some classmates call me stupid and autistic, both behind my back and directly to my face. Also a nasty rumor spread two years ago that I watched hentai during class because I watched a show called 'Jojo's Bizarre Adventure' on my school issued iPad which was in Japanese. Also for some reason girls think I'm a homosexual because I hadn't made an attempt at getting a female partner and kind of shut down any advancements out of embarrassment rather then lack of interest.

With all that out of the way, in short my public life in ruined at school. School starts for me on the 15th of next month and I was wondering if I should kill myself in front of everyone during one of my classes. I never made a plan for it though. The thing is that I am REALLY afraid of death and dying. Does this mean that I'm suicidal or depressed or is my mind just entertaining the thought? I don't want to make a big deal out of it if I'm just subconsciously attention seeking. I already take anti-depressants but I think my life is either just torture until I can reach a seperate environment where I'm anonymous or it's a matter of just ending it. I'm a senio",24Jul2019,2

14,"I have anxiety, sometimes depression, I exhibit symptoms of ADHD. On top of this, I'm a perfectionist. I like everything orderly and organized, but I often feel out of control and don't always have a handle on time, emotions, words... I don't always understand myself or my actions and have to have time to process what I'm feeling.

The truth is, ever since I was little, I have felt different from everyone around me. I felt like there was this disconnect between me and everyone else, like a wire in my brain wasn't functioning properly, and it kept me from being able to interact with people in the way I should. I found expressing my feelings difficult. Pictures from when I was 4 show me stoic, although I remember trying to smile when being told to smile. When people gave me gifts, I was never sure how to react. I remember my mom's slightly disappointed face when I opened a gift without the excitement she hoped for. Nonetheless, I was a happy child and often joyful. When I was upset, however, I often overreacted. I would throw tantrums or, conversely, cry uncontrollably. My emotions overwhelmed me, and I easily felt overstimulated. To this day, my emotions still overwhelm me. There are days when I do still feel overstimulated and my mind wants to explode because too much is happening, and I can't handle it.

On the outside, I appear pretty normal. It's easy for me to socialize, and I get along well with people. Conversation comes easily to me, although I do talk too much at times. I get absorbed by ideas, not so unusual for a PhD student. Nonetheless, it's very easy for me to fall into the habit of thinking abstractly or focusing too intently on small details. (Which sometimes leads to anxiety.) I overthink my interactions with people all the time, and can be quite awkward as a result. Conversely, I often speak without thinking and put my foot in my mouth. I have a hard time finding words to express myself and find it easiest to express my feelings through writing. Even then, it often takes time before I can fully process my emotions. I often experience physical pain when my emotions overwhelm me: a headache or lack of appetite and inability to sleep when I'm anxious. I get anxious very easily. After a panic attack, I almost immediately recognize the irrationality of my feelings and feel deep shame and embarrassment. Sometimes I get numb when I have an overwhelming depressive or anxious episode.

But still, why did I feel so different from such a young age? Why did it feel like a wire was loose in my brain? To this day, I often feel like a child sometimes: I have a hard time filtering myself, I can be naive, I'm gullible and fall for pranks easily, I don't fully understand my own emotions nor am I able to explain them. I'm 31. I mostly feel normal when I'm discussing ideas and abstracts. Otherwise, I feel at odds with the rest of the world. (And yet I can function pretty effectively in the world.)

I'm overthinking about such a little thing, and I can't stop. This has happened before, but usually I just talk to my boyfriend, but this time, he's the reason I'm overthinking.

I've been dating this guy for 3 months. We usually talk to eachother about everthing. But now, He hasn't been online since yesterday morning. It's the next day and almost 10pm rn. Hes always online. Usually I wouldn't worry so much, but we had plans today, plans i messaged him about yesterday. He said he might not be able to go. he was supposed to message me sometime yesterday saying whether he could go or not for sure, but no message, and hes been offline.

Now, the reason I'm worried is, what if hes ghosting me? What if he's too scared to actually break up with me, so this is his way of doing it. He's a pretty awkward, anxious guy. I'm his second girlfriend, his first one broke up with him. He told me a while ago that he was too scared to break up with that girlfriend, but she ended up breaking up with him. I'd like to think he cares about me too much to ghost me, but what if?

This is probably all just nothing, but idk. everytime I try to push the thought away, it keeps coming back even louder.

Plus, I've been ghosted before, two times. So thats not exactky making me feel any better. Plus, I've ghosted someone once, which i regret so much, i didnt know what i was doing, but yeah, i understand the motive somewhat.

The only job offer I've had so far was PT minimum wage which I calculated wouldn't have been enough to pay my rent, let alone gas to cover the ridiculous commute. It was a joke. I have a bachelor's and have well-rounded experiences in an area where most people don't go to college and many don't even finish HS, and I still can't get anyone to take me seriously enough to get an interview. 

To top it all off, I moved my whole life to this small town last year because of a group of people I genuinely loved and cared about associated with a local religious community I had volunteered with before. Something happened with one of the leaders in the group that just completely wrecked my faith and trust in all of them, mostly because of how everyone else reacted (super long story with too much painful detail that I honestly can't handle recounting here and don't want to share someone else's private crap on here). I've reconciled with that particular leader, but don't have the same closeness or trust as before, and the effects of their actions still hurt me deeply on a daily basis. But what was worse was everyone else brushing me off and acting like everything was back to normal like I didn't really have a right to be so affected by it all. I literally told two other leaders after the incident that I was drowning and they basically gave me a pat on the back and asked if I was talking to a therapist and sent me on my way. They did nothing. They all had each other to cope and process what happened but I had no one, and they pushed me out further even knowing this. Now our regular weekly gatherings are a source of pure misery for me and I can barely get out of the parking lot before bursting into tears. It makes me so angry to hear messages about how we need to be taking practical steps to lift each other up and involve ourselves in other's lives when they knew that I was hurting and no one has asked me how I've been in months. Even the mention of the incident today can still bring me to tears, and no one has bothered to check up on how I'm doing with all of that. I have one friend who does their best to love me and has been there for me. I do appreciate this friend, but if I'm being honest they just don't know how to help me and most of what I tell them goes over their head and it gets really frustrating sometimes because I know they are totally willing to listen but they don't get it and don't know how to respond in a helpful way. 

I feel like therapy hasn't been all that helpful either. It's nice to talk to someone, but my counselor is a more traditional talk therapist for individuals and families, and I don't feel like they know what to do with all the trauma of this recent incident or my past trauma growing up, which was basically only talked about in passing and never brought up again. Most of what we've deduced through sessions I could have told my therapist already just from my own research. I hate to self diagnose, but I'm pretty sure I have an alphabet soup of stuff going on in my head and body that isn't being addressed. My mother always thought I had Adhd as a kid but I brushed it off, but now I'm seeing key markers for it in adulthood which is making things harder, not to mention anxiety, depression, and symptoms of CPTSD. I'm not even sure my therapist believes I still have ongoing depression after all these months, and had it several years before even seeing this counselor. I can appear high functioning from the outside, but I'm in a state of emotional anguish the majority of the time. I want to look for more intensive trauma therapy, but don't even know what kind of therapy to look for or where to find it. It's a moderately isolated area where most specialized things like that are at least an hour away driving.

I'm just completely exhausted in every possible way. I nap or wander around my apartment most of the day because I'm too tired to do much else. I rarely even have the physical energy and mental focus (at the same time) to go out anywhere to hunt for jobs (I don't have internet at my place so I have to find free wifi to apply online anywhere). I wish I had the energy and mindset to just go do things where I could meet new people. I feel completely stuck and isolated here. I stayed this long because I initially thought this was a safe place to start healing from past traumas, but this new trauma has left me alone again and I'm trying to stick it out until I can be myself again but it's been almost a year and still have flashbacks and get terrible anxiety in certain places, and everyone seems even more distant. I don't want to move and run away, because that's always been my default and I want to try and heal, but I just feel totally broken and unable to do anything to fix it. At this point I'm so angry and hurt that when people from this group do say hi I just give them the shortest possible response because even if they do ask how I am it's too late. They're asking the corpse they let drown how it's doing, and I'm not doing great. I'm rotting away here, but what's that matter? 

I guess I don't really know what I'm hoping to accomplish here, I just need to get it all out since I have no one to really talk to about it. Everything is just a tangle of really messy intense emotions that I don't know what to do with. In the beginning this group made it seem like they were there to help support me and guide me as I sought healing but after this incident everyone pulled away from me entirely, like I was expected to just figure it all out from there. I really thought I was getting better in spite of that initially, but now I'm even worse off than before. I feel like I'm one incident or careless word away from a mental breakdown.

30,"To begin, this post is about my own mental health around sex and I'm really looking for any comments or thoughts on my situation.

I was previously in a relationship for about four years. The beginning of 2019 I got the courage to leave (with the help of the advice on here) because I knew the man I was dating wasn't treating me right and it had begun to take a toll of me mentally. In the next few paragraphs I'm going to give a run down of how everything went down.

&amp;#x200B;

August 2018 I left for college seven hours away from my hometown and in turn,  left my (ex)boyfriend who was attending the local university. We planned on doing long distance and in the first month it was going well. We made plans to visit each other at a halfway city one weekend and this is where I began to rethink our relationship. We had been very close sexually but when I left for college I realized that sex isn't everything and I wanted more than a sexual partner (we went on dates and such but a large portion of our relationship was based around sex). During our weekend, I had turned down the offer to have sex and it bothered him but he didn't say much. However, as the months went on, anytime I would deny sex (which at most was one time per weekend we'd be able to see each other) he began to get harsher and harsher on my decision. Basically, he would make me feel really really bad (by disputing my decision and saying it was because I didn't love him or I was cheating on him) for not wanting to do it with him. 

There was one night we were visiting each other and I really did not want to do anything because we had already done it a few times that day and it sort of hurt down there. I told him I didn't want to and for the next half hour he tried to convince me to have sex with him. By the end of the half hour I was honestly fed up and tired so I gave in and that was the first time I cried after having sex. I felt used. I felt like I was just becoming an object in his mind and it was really hurting me. The second time I cried was because I had turned down sex and my boyfriend had gotten very angry at me and slammed the bedroom door and went outside. This is when I got scared. He didn't harm me in any way but it really didn't feel good to have him get so mad about me saying no. 

While I was at college, I started talking to him less and less per day and it got to the point where I'd maybe message him once a day. He wouldn't text first. Through all of this I had my best friend of four years by my side at college who I leaned on heavily to make me happy but I never told him about what was going on in my relationship. Because of me having a male best friend, my boyfriend would often times accuse me of cheating (which I never once did or thought about). I leaned really heavily on my BFF and over time, I fell in love with him because he's the nicest man I've ever met and always makes me laugh and smile and forget about my problems. This is when I made the decision to break up with my boyfriend. When I broke up with him he got very angry at first and threw many insults my way and I took them without saying any back because I didn't want to be the bad guy. In this situation he honestly made me feel like a horrible person and I felt so bad for how I made him feel. Throughout us talking through the break up he kept changing from being angry to saying he was sorry for how he treated me then going back to being angry at me, and then produced the thought that he'd be able to get back with me. Then he just got angry again and I got more insults and then he finally stopped talking to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to where I am now, I'm in a very healthy and blossoming relationship with said best friend (who professed his love for me with the thought that I didn't love him too but I've liked him since forever so now we're very happy that we can finally start being more than friends) but today my brain really got in my way. I really didn't think saying no to sex again would make me subconsciously feel bad but it did. I told him I couldn't because it's that time of the month and he understood completely but I still felt so horrible for saying no to him. I reverted back to thinking he was going to get mad at me and keep trying to get me to and even though he never did, in my head I just kept thinking about how he was mad at me and now he's not gonna like me anymore. This got me thinking about how I was categorizing him with my previous boyfriend even though he is the complete opposite. 

I don't want to feel guilty for saying no to sex and I didn't think that what my previous boyfriend did was going to affect me in my next relationships. It sucks when my head gets in the way and makes me get sad again because I'm at such a good point in my life right now I just want to stay happy. Everything I've wanted for the past year is happening and I don't want my own brain and thoughts to harm my current relationship and happiness. 

If you've read this far, thank you :)  I'd really appreciate some input or comments on my situation to help me better understand and get through this little bump in the road. If you have any questions to better help I'll be glad to answer",24Jul2019,1

I cant keep on living this way. I feel like i will explode. I just want  this to stop so please make it stop. Please. So why is it nit the answer? It will literally relieve me from my anxiety, my stress, my fears, my everything. I dont enjoy life i dpnt enjoy anything. It just seems logical to want to end it and it seems reasonable. Can you possibly imagine living with constant fear of the work going to fall apart? God i cant keep this up im not strong enough. So please just let me. Why is suicide not a solution if it takes away everything that is bad. Tell me, explain to me! Family? Lol this is about me not about anyone else.

33,"Life has been pretty rough for me lately, I don't really want to dive on the details, I just want to mention that this year hasn't been the best so far.

In 2015 I was diagnosed by a professional with light depression, I started medication, went for professional care, etc, and in early 2017, I was getting a lot better, my family was united back again, I had a loving cute girlfriend who I loved, good friends, etc, which really helped me out... But it's no longer 2017, my girlfriend left me because she got bored of me, my family fell apart back again, all of this in the span of just one year, and now, all I have is a small group of friends who really help me out, but I can only see them on certain weekends, as we left school, and my parents won't let me go out with them every weekend, and I have to live the sad reality that in a few years, I won't be able to see them anymore, as I'll move for college to another city, all in my own... So basically, in two years, I will have nothing of what helped me to get rid of my depression, and I've been living with that thought ever since I realized a few months ago... What if I get depression again, but I'm all alone? I don't want to kill myself, I'm kinda impulsive, I know I would be capable of doing it... I live in a 19th floor, every time I walk from the elevator to my door, I stare at the fall I would have if I wanted to jump. When I walk anywhere, I always think of what if a vehicle ran over me. When I'm alone in my apartment, I always think of what would happen if I had a mortal accident doing anything and I pass out all alone?! 

I'm in need of sleeping pills to have a good sleep, otherwise, I would just roll in bed thinking about all of this, any help or tips about how to overcome these problems would be much appreciated

Tldr; Everything outside of the healthcare that helped me to cure my depression two years ago isn't a part of my life anymore/won't be here in a short time, I can't stop thinking about my death and I'll be living completely alone in two years. I need sleeping pills to sleep now",24Jul2019,1
34,"A fee months ago my wife and I befriended someone through the video game Overwatch.

In that time we've learned a few details about him in our time playing together.

He's 15 years old from California.

Last week he confided to my wife that he has been depressed and even thought of suicide. She told him that we would be sad if that were to happen.

We've also learned that he's had a very hard life. He's been in foster care since 3, and his current foster family is unsupported. Currently we are one of his closest contacts other than his girlfriend. 

While we've never met this boy in person, and it's not likely that we will, we're very concerned for him. We want to do want we can to help and support him. 


I feel like he really needs someone to be with him in person to support him. So I think one of my steps will be to try search for some local resources for him, groups and crisis lines.

36,"I've been a control freak as long as I can remember. It has caused a lot of problems for me and the people around me so I guess I wanna change and become a less shitty person, and attacking the root of the problem seems like a decent idea.

The problem is that this trait is so deeply ingrained in my personality that I don't know if its actually possible and I feel like its a core part of my identity sadly.

I think that the biggest reason I'm unable to change is that when I lose control of something, my brain just kind of stops caring about it? And this applies to basically anything, hobbies, people, responsibilities, places... you name it. And its pretty hard to keep doing something that is 1). Outside of your comfort zone and 2). Uninteresting. 

Big fat F I guess. I really don't know if I should try changing or just give up and focus on the problems caused by me being a control freak which include things like procrastination and just me being an asshole in general amongst other things.

I've always had the philosophy that you should go straight to the root of the problem but when the root is so deeply ingrained, is it worth it to remove it or should you just try and control its growth?

37,"I’ve recently been having extreme anxiety at work when I am working with a specific doctor (I work at an animal clinic).  This particular doctor is “high energy” and have anxiety but to where it’s more of anger when she is overwhelmed. She’ll become twitchy and clench her teeth and wave her arms/hands around. Really making a huge scene weather it’s really called for or not in a situation. When first being there she let me know that she is a high energy person and to not take her reactions personally. I tired my best to but with myself having anxiety it’s harder for me to brush it off. Since working with her I’ve begin to doubt my skills (even with working in the field for almost 3 plus years) and I’ve honestly seen myself slip and messing up more. i feel that this is due to her reactions to me if I am not understanding something, things aren’t running the way she wants it to (if a patient is being difficult ect) or asking to verify instructions.  I don’t want to try and run away from the issue and quit since besides that one doctor, I do enjoy working with my other coworkers but it has really taken a toll on myself and how I view and trust my skills.  I’m just not sure how to deal with the issue or keep my anxiety at bay.

40,"Please excuse any errors in spelling, grammar ect, for that i am nervous for doing this. Here goes.

I have been battling with myself since pretty much half my life. I am thirty years old, in have a six year old son, a girlfriend (not his mother) and work at a decent job where i get along with almost everyone. With that being said, i still feel a tension with in me that wont seem to let up as of late.

Ill start at the very beginning. When it comes to my childhood my memory gets fuzzy. But its the traumatic things that happened to me i remember vividly . One instant i remember that there was a dentist that went nuts because i wouldnt stop crying (i believe i was five at the time) he took me to an other room, grabbed me by my face and proceeded to scream at me. It wad until my mom saw and took me away from there. I dont know what happened after because i feel thats when i started to shut down. I hope he got fired, who knows. 

Around the same time i was babysat by some chick my mom knew and her husband would be there too. I cant remember why but again i couldnt stop crying and it made him mad until he actually grabbed my throat and again i shut down (see the trend here?). 

*im starting to breathe heavily but need to continue.

Now lets fast forward to something that happened to me that i never opened up to my parents, my current girlfriend and many of my closest friends. *tears starting to well up*

I was molested by a person who used to watch me when i was in the 3rd grade. I will not say his name due to the fact that his family didnt know and also he died years later. All i can say is that he made me touch him and watch him get off. After that i tried my best to avoid that place. I didnt say anything because he threaten to kill me. So i didnt. Then when i left that town to my new school my mom pulled me aside and told me that he died. I acted sad in front of her but inside i was laughing to the point i almost slipped. If theres a hell i bet that fucker is there.

Not in between that and most of my middle school things at home werent much better. My parents split and re married (mom twice) so all i knew was them. One side used physical punishment, the other used scream tactics. 

There were a couple times i was whipped with a belt for forgetting my homework. Or thrown across the room for a bad grade. Youd think my own mother would stop it all but no she joind in on it as well. Not to mention the pressures that was middle school. Being bullied, molested AGAIN but this time by some eighth grade girls, verbally abusive counsilers shit goes on and on. The same thing happens i shut down but this time its different. I started to feel a hot feeling in my body. Something that was building up for a long time. It was rage. Pure rage. It wasnt until i got in my very first fight it came out. Even though it lasted about eight seconds but it felt like the best eight seconds ever. He hit me in the face with a sprite can and then i punched his fucking lights out. The buzz of that was probably compareable to having sex for the first time. And i wanted more... ",24Jul2019,1
41,"I am a female, 23, and live in Canada. I have never immensely struggled with my own mental health except for what I am posting below. Today is the first time that I have come to terms with it and am seeking advice from others who may have more knowledge. 

On the outside, I appear to be a ""social butterfly"" and do not struggle with social situations. I have a large group of friends. I typically do not struggle too much in making new friends; however, it does take me a while to open up to new individuals in my life. I enjoy attending parties with my friends &amp; I enjoy hosting parties for my friends. When I'm with friends at large social events, I have a great time and do not feel anxious at all. 

When I am alone, everything is different. I would never go to a concert alone. I would never go to a party alone. I struggle immensely with even walking through a grocery store alone and I always feel the need to call someone while I'm there so that I feel as if someone is with me. I will always use self-check out when alone at stores. I stayed at a hotel last weekend and woke up at 5am each morning to prepare myself for the thirty second conversation that I would have with the housekeeping staff at 9am. A maintenance man was supposed to come to my house today and I was awake all last night in preparing the conversation I would have with him, and I then woke up at 6am to wait for him even though he was not arriving until 5pm. I ended up rescheduling his visit to when my boyfriend would also be home. I always ensure that my packages are being delivered to the depot so I don't risk any chance of interacting with the individual delivering it. I will **never** answer a telephone call from a number I do not know. I am always afraid that people are watching me when I am alone, and feel the weight of the world on my shoulders to even walk around my neighborhood because I do not want others to see me. I played pictionary the other day with a group of individuals that I do not know well, and I had to fight the lump in my throat each time that it came to my turn. It feels as though I cannot be happy until I get through each of these interactions. 

I do not know if this is social anxiety. Perhaps I'm just being silly and need to grow up, but I do not know that it is something that disrupts my life and I'm just not sure what to do about it. My boyfriend tells me that it is a problem and I should reach out for further assistance in coping with it; whereas my mother thinks that it just something that I will grow out of and does not believe it is a genuine issue since I am someone with lots of friends and enjoy certain social situations. Anyway, after freaking out about the maintenance man today, I just felt the need to reach out because I don't know if this is a real problem and should look further into this, or if it is something I am thinking too much about. 

Thanks for listening everyone. I really appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - i think i may have social anxiety, but am not sure and may just be overthinking this. i am fine with certain social situations and have no problems in making friends, but completely freak out in every day interactions that should not be an issue for most.",24Jul2019,2

43,"So fast forward a few years later at twenty four my girl at the time and i gave birth to our son. That was the greatest achievement i could ever accomplish because i sought out to be better than my parents and raise him better than how i was brought up and protect him from the hurt that i went through. I felt (still feel) like a superhero when i was watching him grow. Felt like nothong could touch me. Boy was i wrong.

At the start it was the usual challenges on first time parenting. Her and i argued at times. Id go to work (winco at the time) shed be at home. Money was always tight, going from place to place, just trying to be a successful family. But at some point we fell out of love for each other. And it was later on she found comfort in other men. I was devastated.

Rewind a little because in the middle of all this i lost my grandmother on Christmas eve and to even add more to this we find out that my mother was diagnosed with an appendix cancer as well which she passed away just two months after my grandma. Now this is where it gets better. On the last few moments my mom was on her death bed, my was going to be wife was out with some guy. 

So lets do the math. Discounting the shit i went through what in entry one. I lost both my mother and grandmother and was cheated on and became a single dad all pretty much at once. Pretty fucked up.

So how does this all affect me now. Well for starters i cant take it when random people touch me, im self conscious when it comes to relationships where i feel like im driving my current girlfriend away from me, i go to bed crying almost too frequent, im a short fuse and i dont know how to relay my feelings in a productive manner and this is all to a point where id rather suffer in silence than to open up because i fear of being judged or people looked at me like im crazy. 

Now this isnt suppose to be a pity party of any kind because despite all that has happened to me other people have either suffered what ive been through or worse. This is to show that no matter how happy or tough they and i look on the outside theres something hurting on the inside.

49,"This probably isn’t gonna be expressed all too well and I’ll forewarn you that I’m gonna go on some tangents, but here we go:

I’m a pretty mild-mannered guy, but I’ve noticed what’s described in the title. It’s probably been happening for a few years, and how badly it happens depends on how I’m feeling at the time. I’ll give an example:

I haven’t been doing too well for the past couple weeks. Don’t really have a reason, work’s been boring and I’ve been talking to my friends on Snapchat, but either way I’ve been feeling kind of numb, down, etc. A couple days ago, I was home alone and in my room and my dog started losing his shit downstairs, barking at some dog walking past our house (he does this a lot). Normally, if I’m in a decent mood or there are other people home I’ll just try to move him away from the window, but this time I basically exploded. Yelled louder than I remember ever doing from upstairs then stormed down and chased him away from the window (I didn’t touch or hurt him, would never dream of it). The part that got me was he ran away and hid under a side table, which I’d never seen him do. Right after seeing that, I went from pissed to sort of horrified in an instant.

From there I walked over to a door near me and just started hitting my head against it. (I don’t know when I started hitting my head on things, but I find that I do it when I’m especially upset or stressed about something. I talked to a counselor about it and the best explanation I could give was that I was doing to it cope while half hoping I’d accidentally injure myself while it was happening.) It wasn’t hard enough to cause any damage (it never is).

I’ve never been diagnosed as having any sort of mental health issues, though I have gone to “therapy” (counseling) at school for anxiety and then low self-esteem.

I’m kind of wondering if anyone has any similar experiences of this. I know I should talk to a professional, and I plan on it once school starts up again.",24Jul2019,2

51,"Hi everyone,

As the title says, I have a catchy name that sticks in my mind for over a month...

It all started when I have trouble sleeping and was bothered by weird thoughts every day. Then I Googled whether those thoughts will go away, but then the f\*\*\*ing searching algorithm shows the ""symptoms"" of a word, a phrase or a song that stucks in mind. Then I got super anxious that my mind would get stuck in a phrase. And then things happen, I had a night when I could not sleep, then I think of people that passed away in my family, which is normal. But then my mind diverted to a catchy name of a person that I haven't even met or known of on the internet, and it just stays there in my mind...

I wish I NEVER KNOW these symptoms exist and my life would be so much better.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone been in the same situation and how did you overcome it?

Thank you!",24Jul2019,3
52,"I'm 19, I've gone to therapy twice before, once for family problems with my father when I was 17 and one for self harm when I was 16. Both only lasted a few months and I stopped showing up to the first one because I felt it was making everything worse, and I didn't feel comfortable enough at either to really tell the full truth of everything.

The first therapist told me I showed signs of anxiety and depression, but just gave me coloring pages to help me. The second one told me I seemed normal and my stepmom seemed to be causing me a lot of stress but she didn't know about me going to therapy previously.

I left for school in the fall and was drinking heavily and started abusing substances more. I almost threw myself out of my dorm window but instead cried uncontrollably while texting my friend who lived in my building that I needed to go to the hospital because I was scared I would actually do it. I never ended up going. The next quarter I took a handful of pills and ended up being dragged out of my room and into the student rec building where I ended up puking up the pills in the bathroom. No one knows about the second time. I ended up moving home after I was sexually assaulted, but no one knows that is the reason I came home. 

I have had a series of irrational feels my entire life. The first was the fear of public restrooms because I feel like someone could come through the ceiling and do something. I'm afraid of my toes being exposed while I'm sleeping because I think someone is going to take a rake to my toes and legs. I'm afraid of tap water and water from the fridge spout because I think that it is going to have toxins from either the government or some higher authority and I'll either die or turn into some sort of undead monster.

I have a talent of talking myself into believing almost anything I say. Recently, I was trying to fall asleep and thought I could hear a heart beat monitor in my left ear and convinced my self that I am in a coma and can't wake up. Part, of me believes this is true. I think I am going to get cancer or I already have it, but I am too scared to make an appointment to actually find out.

I haven't been sleeping well and haven't been able to focus on my school work and I constantly freak out at everyone I love.

I've been meaning to make an appointment to see if something is wrong with me but I'm scared my parents will find out and tell me I'm fine. Or worse that me feeling not normal is in fact normal.",24Jul2019,2

2. Can never make a choice of what I want to do so I usually end up never doing anything.
3. If I actually do start doing something I usually just give up out of frustration or boredom or find some other excuse to not do it.
4. I have aspiration to do things, but I just don't have the motivation or willpower to do it.
5. I feel like I have to be special or be talented in some way to be validated by my peers.

55,"the last time i posted about this someone was kind of a dick about it but i have nowhere else to turn (again) 

i remember an afternoon in the summer right before we had to leave my childhood home, after spending years extremely depressed in my room, where i suddenly felt awake again, and suddenly the world was beautiful again. 

since then i thought i was getting better, but life kinda gave me the shaft and now i'm miserable, and i'm miserable that i'm back to being this depressed 

not being able to drive due to moderate/severe anxiety is really really really shafting me over to the point there's just no point in existing anymore, i'm not doing anything, waking up every day doing very little then going to sleep is no use

because i can't drive and it's not safe to walk around here, i can't even get a bare minimum of autonomy as i waste away in my grandparents' basement, get older having done nothing with my teens and at this rate i won't do anything with my 20s either 

i'd get a job and move out but i'd have to be driven to my job by my granddad who already has a job to go to, and most employers around here ask for a valid driver's license  

i've never really had a life and on this pace i never will, despite everything my family's gone through to try and set me up and every day i tried so hard to ""make it"" doing art it's all come down to this, completely empty and pointless

the only friend i have is too far away to reasonably ask to come over, i've spent my whole life just smiling and playing to my grandparents &amp; my crazy parent and not being a person, ever. even if i did get out of here somehow i wouldn't know how to do anything and i'd be too scared to do the rest 

sure, in theory i can like, do chores and shit to be of some use during the day but that doesn't help *my* life

i'm in my 20s, i don't get to choose to go anywhere, i don't get to choose how to use my space, i don't get to choose what to do with my time except when granddad's at work, i don't even get to choose what or how i eat

I am really good at doing all the things you're supposed to do, like get enough sleep,  exercise,  talking about how I feel, create a structured life etc. Sometimes I will go on medication but I'm usually as ble to get through without it.

But every time she goes more than 5 minutes without texting me, I start to get incredibly anxious, and I get this intense emotional pain, which is so bad I start feeling physical pain in my chest. I’ve tried distracting myself, but I literally can’t. Nothing makes that pain go away except for when she texts me back. 


In all of my past relationships, my girlfriend started drifting away before eventually breaking up with me. My current girlfriend hasn’t shown any real signs of that yet, but I keep overthinking everything and get this horrible feeling in my gut that I’m slowly losing her, or that she’s gonna cheat on me or leave me for another guy. 


I’m so obsessed with her (not in a healthy, loving way. Like an unhealthy, crazy way) that it literally makes me nauseous. 


Because of this, I’m getting more stress from this relationship than good. But I can’t lose her. It would kill me. And it would also hurt her, because she has repeatedly told me that she loves me very much and that she doesn’t want to lose me, and that she hopes to marry me someday.

I get the same support and help from them as I do from friends and family. Luckily, the therapy so far has been free due to my parent's work benefits.

Long story short, at this point I feel like I need to see a psychiatrist. But I have always had a hard time admitting when I need help especially to the ones I love and know. I guess it really has to do with my pride. I try to blur out the bad parts of my life to those I care about. I want everyone to think I am put together and have my life figured out. I am unsure how to go about getting started. Having to tell my husband or my parents that I need this help literally makes me sick to my stomach so I have been avoiding it but I am at a breaking point and I don't know how much longer I can take it. 

Then, I think about my first session and my anxiety sky rockets. Do I just go in there and blurt out all my issues the first session? How do I decide what to start with?

hi reddit. so i’ve known that i lie more than others for years now, but within the last 2 or so years i’ve noticed that i lie constantly; i lie about big things, small things, good things, bad things, etc. my friends think i have a way more interesting life than i have (and that i have way more medical ailments than i have). 

i lie to my parents, my friends, and everyone else around me for no real reason. and it’s getting so scary, i feel like the real me is trapped inside my brain.

anyways, i started to research and i think i most likely have pathological lying/compulsive lying tendencies. what scares me about that is that it’s usually a sign of something larger that i would need to seek help for, but seeking help would mean i would need to come out to my family/friends about it.

i think they’d either not believe me, or hate me for constantly lying about anything that suits me.

67,"Hi,

Since I moved to Belgian five years ago, I developed a phobia of people and stopped interacting socially (withdrawn) in the last few years.

Why? I perceive most people as angry with me in everyday situations- doctors, hospital, work, walking down the street, storekeeper, bankteller, police, ex-friends, everybody except my parents and sibling (who live abroad). Previous lifelong friends ceased contact with me: stopped returning calls , and made excuses why we could not meet up: they looked angry when they did see me.
Doctors look really annoyed with me and I see them quite relieved when the appointment comes to an end.  i have found one GP who seems quite nice and not angry so will continue to see him as and when.

I joined some local social groups, but was quickly excluded from conversations and have since stopped attending. 

 I have lived in 7 different countries and cultures over the past 30 years, but never developed this problem. This is new for me.

I do not see angry people when I visit other countries. On the contary, I am quite happy to chat with other outside of my current country.

I looked for psychologists here but few are in English, but I admit I have developed a total distrust of everybody where I live. I saw two Psychologists locally but they lacked interest in what i was telling them and there was no diagnosis  because I ran out of money at the time. They didn't look angry, but more indifferent and cold. Maybe there is hope!

When the world is for the taking I am appartment unbearable to be around. So when everything is better than it has ever been my friends hate me. I can hear them talking in the room. The better part of me knows they aren't talking about me, but I think they are. Every so often when they talk I can hear my name or I hear him or he. Surely there are other things for them to talk about. Why bad mouth someone when you could talk about things that make you feel good.

No One Can Relate To Me. I Am Just a Sick Fuck With a Scrambled Ass Brain",24Jul2019,5
76,"For the last year I didn't dream at all. I hoped that I would because enjoy dreams.. if they're nice. Now I regret hoping for that. A bit over a week ago I dreamed about my old school (bigest and most successful school altho going on a conveyor and in the 4th bigest city in ny country, so a lot of peeps) getting bombed, the terrorists chasing me and my NEW school's friend running away with me. Then the next day there was another bad dream that I forgot, but I know it was there. Now this night I dreamed about again, some bad people using insects as a bio weapon and somehow letting them into the big superbowl type field where a soccer cup was going on??? And there was my mom, even tho she doesn't like soccer. I forgot the part where and how I noticed what's going on in reality but what I do remember is that I called my mom and said something about it happening and saying I love you and shit like that. I remember myself hysterically crying at the last seconds. Then when all hell went loose, I woke up, sad.

Sorry for the long story which is most likely badly worded, but I just want to know why is this happening. I don't want this.",24Jul2019,1
77,"When you are high functioning, that is despite everything you can still somewhat take care of yourself, people’s empathy decreases drastically, their apathy increases, and their tolerance level is at a zero. If you complain, it’s annoying. You are looking for excuses because obviously, you can do it. Obviously, you can help yourself. You have been doing it for many years and it hasn’t hurt you (on the outside). 

I am at my wrists’ end. Truth be told I don’t have anyone. I seek validation and attention on Reddit. This is my 15th account or something. Whenever I sort of get to know someone, I get the same old platitudes, and when that person really gets to know me, those platitudes become dismissive. “why don’t you just try?” “why don’t you do it yourself?” Because I have always been doing it myself, what’s so different today? 

Literally since I was a child, I was the one doing things important to me, for me. My parents were not at all involved. It taught me to rely on myself only, but I still feel solitude and I still feel broken and I still feel tired! I just want once ounce of genuine empathy. Not empty platitudes, and not dismissive words disguised as encouragement. 

I am so sad. I was on discord yesterday, and this person who I grew to trust turned dismissive. I was letting him know that there was yet another roadblock in my life and I truly don’t know how to get over it. He suggested me to just, figure it out. I asked him I don’t know what to do, does he know? He said no. I blocked him. 

It sounds petty, and actually I wasn’t really seeking help from him. But it’s the fact that he started giving me platitudes in the past couple of days, and I was in the middle of a mental breakdown. So him giving up so easily after promising he’d “never give up for me” or whatever else, empty promises I hear all the damn time, I snapped. I don’t care. Anyway, I’m gonna have to rely on myself once again. Despite having a mental breakdown on a daily basis now, I am all alone again. I am so, so close to the edge. One major roadblock and I’m done. I have a date scheduled and if life doesn’t stay stable for 2 weeks, it’s over. I’ll just die.

This posted started off as something, and ended up being something else. I don’t know what I’m trying to do other than ask for attention. I don’t know anymore. I am literally losing my mind. I have no control over who I am, but I am genuinely alone. What should I do??? I need genuine, genuine help please.",24Jul2019,1

79,"Hey, sorry for that first word, I don’t know how to dive into this, but I’ll try my best.

I’m not diagnosed with any mental condition, thus far, but I do have family history of Bipolar and ADHD. I don’t really know what’s wrong with me. I feel really foggy a lot of the times. I just feel like everything happening around me is impossible, like the world is a lie. I used to self-harm some months ago, I managed to break it off due to fear of getting caught. I some days feel really energized but the fog is still there and other days more low. My parents always complain about me not doing what they say, that I don’t respect authority and that I shouldn’t talk back to them. I just don’t know how to. When I say to myself, I’ll stop doing this and that. I never stop. I just can’t.

I was always told I was smart or brilliant or nice, but I never think of myself like that. I believe myself to be the opposite of that. I just don’t believe how I can be called that when my grades dipped, my attitude is annoying, and when I promise to myself that I’ll stop I never managed to do so. I, sometimes, hate what I do. I take too long to do things. I have foggy brain, bad memory for certain things and sometimes a self-hatred that I myself can’t understand. Between all that coupled with the self harm. I just don’t know what to do. Even worse, sometimes I do drastic things or I take thing too seriously or get angry at small things. Sometimes  I feel like an asshole for things I do but I don’t know how to control. For some reason, when my mom was diagnosed with cancer I didn’t cry, I didn’t get sad, I was just smiling. When my aunt warned me to not give her stress I was smiling. Sometimes I don’t take what I should seriously.

And, after all of that, I don’t want to believe I can have any mental disorder, or problems. I don’t want to tell my parents to take me to a psychiatrist. I’m scared of it. I don’t know what will happen. And I just don’t want my parents to find out how I actually tick like inside. I don’t want them to think I’m an emotionless bastard, which from what I see myself I am. I don’t know why I complain about so much things yet I don’t help at all. I don’t understand why I’m so useless to everyone in my family. I don’t understand why I sometimes think of suicide as an answer yet somehow manage to control it. I don’t understand why I even think that sometimes people hate me or why I do a lot of things. I know that those people don’t hate me or it’s very minimal, but I just don’t know.

I wish I had some answer, some way to get help, without being so stressed out. Can anyone please help me with what I should do, or if I’m just lying to myself?",24Jul2019,1
80,"I'm 16 and have had really bad social anxiety for a long time. I probably haven't made friends in school in 4 years. I very rarely talk to people and have really poor confidence in myself. The only people I ever talk to are two friends I've met online and one I recently met in person for the first time in ages. I have a VERY unstable home/family life and am literally only happy when I'm able to be around that friend, I've gotten to the point where I'm desperate for socialization and cry myself to sleep on many nights. I feel really pathetic and worthless and lost right now.",24Jul2019,10
81,"After asking a few friends and I have had a few mixed responses.

In February my relationship ended with a girl who I really loved and I just haven't been the same since. During February/March I was at my worst, I couldn't stop thinking about her and I kind of pushed friends away as I just wanted to be alone and away from everything.

It got really bad and during these months I started to burn myself, I know this was really stupid but at the time it just felt like the only form of relief if that makes sense? I had really deep thoughts and at the time I just wanted everything to stop, it felt like my brain was causing me so many issues.

Anyway since February/march (my worst months) things have got better but not significantly better. I still think about things a lot especially late at night and it makes me get really upset and I then lose motivation for everything and have considered the burning since but haven't done it since March.

A few friends have said maybe you should seek some help where as others have suggested that its just a heart break thing and things will eventually get better.

I have had a few other issues in my life that have caused me to feel upset however the break up being the most significant. 

As mentioned things have got better but I do start to feel depressed when I think about it more and more and I just cant stop thinking about it and it drives me crazy. I just don't want to get back into the stage of the burning again because I couldn't stop myself.

Anyway my question is should I seek help or leave it a bit and see if I do feel better?",24Jul2019,2

86,"My Fiancée has BPD. We’ve been together 4 years, both 25. She’s live with my Mother while I’m away for work. 

For my Fiancée it’s sudden and violent mood swings, extreme irrational anger that comes out as an almost paranoia. The thing is though, she’ll be the best version of herself outside and then come home and then it’s a nightmare. 

I’m truly at my whits end with dealing with it. Although I love and care for her I am feeling increasingly stressed and depressed in my own home. My mother and she also feels the same way. We both have tried our best to support her, but the home is becoming increasingly a negative, volatile environment to live in. 

I’ve just come back home for two weeks of leave after being away 2 months of a 4 month stint away from home and it’s been nothing but a roller coaster of emotions on a level I’ve never experienced before with her. I’m going back away in a few days and I am dreading the thought of leaving with this instability lingering. I honestly thought this time at home would be great, and it was for two days, but like I said before it’s just been an absolute roller coaster.

Not my family, not the people who call themselves my friends, not myself. I feel like my body is on autopilot, and any therapist I've seen just medicates me with sedatives.

90,"I feel... extremely weird. I don't know what other word than that I could use, I just can't find any. I feel like my mind is blocked and my tongue is stuck in my mouth, cause whenever I want to make a sound, something's stopping me. I still would like to talk about it though, share my case and just... unload, hopefully. 

I can't find meaning in anything, but at the same time I want to do so many things -- I think it's the best way I can put it, the easiest. I'm constantly tired, angry, mad at everyone, I want to scream and cry, run away, be alone and away from the whole world -- but I also feel so alive? It's dumb, it probably doesn't make any sense, but while feeling so numb, I still feel like doing something. I feel like writing, traveling, visiting new places, taking photos, meeting new people... I feel like I want to be alive. 

As you may expect, I usually end up doing nothing though. For example, I have so many stories in mind that I would like to write, I'm almost excited, dare to say, to just come back home from work each day and write something, put my feelings on paper as I used to do so before this whole thing with mixed up feelings has started. I want to do it, I know I would enjoy it -- but when I finally sit down and try to write, I just freeze. I suddenly forget all the words that exist, I don't know how to express myself, how to write down a single sentence. So then I give up. And I just sit there, completely still, looking straight ahead and sometimes not even thinking about anything. I'm just so empty. Empty but somehow, still so full of things, feelings and emotions. 

And of course, it's not only about writing. It's about anything. Just few days ago, Hubby and I wanted to watch a movie and because of me being so disoriented and disconnected from the world, we were pausing it so often. The movie was 1,5 hour but it took us at least 3 to finish it. After that, I just went to bed, wanting to end that day as fast as I could, hoping that tomorrow would be better -- it wasn't. It was just the same and all the days after that still are. 

I don't know how else to explain it, what else to say. It's hard to write, talk, think... It's a miracle I wrote this post at all. My question is though, has anyone experienced something like this before? What is this feeling? Where does it come from? And how to get rid of it?",24Jul2019,1
91,"This is my first post on here, and i'm sorry in advance for its length, but i'm desperate and in neeed of an honest, unbiased opinion on what should i do with my current situation or in the near future.

I will include my backstory, as i believe every detail is important.

I am a 16 yrs old girl, i am from Romania and i struggle with depression, or at least that's what i was diagnosed with. I was born with a weird case of syndactyly (2 fingers' skin completely fused together, the rest, excepting the thumb, are webbed together half way. It has also severely affected my bone growth, as my fingers are way shorter than normal, my phalanx are fused and the bones are very thin, basically turning them into sticks.) I am still able to use that hand but it looks really weird, and when i was little i was bullied for it. I was also bullied for my skin color, since i am mixed race (white and african) and kids would run away from me saying i'm a gipsy (wich in my country is oftenly used as an insult), gorrila, monkey etc. 

My mother and grandmother, my only parents then, since dad is in the us, enrolled me into a piano course since it was suggested by doctors because it would help with the flexibility and strength in my affected hand. After a while, seeing i was good they enrolled me into multiple choirs, some modelling and dancing stuff, a proper course for piano and later percussion, and in a bigger, more important choir. I never really had a childhood. I was busy running around between school and those activities until 8th grade when i dropped everything. I couldn't take it anymore. I would cry as i was practicing and my teacher noticed, tried to tell my parents about it but they just said he's senile (he was quite old, but he was still sharp as a tack). 

My grandmother would put both me and mom under so much stress. She was, and still is, the main cause of our problems. She'd call me names every day, like retarded, stupid, useless, worthless, gipsy etc. Every day. When i would break down and start calling her out she'd get mad and deny all this, sometimes snapping at me, grabbing me by the arms and yelling at me, sometimes banging herself in the head with her fists, palms or almost pulling her own hair out. I could hear how she and mom would fight almost every day. I saw mom almost throwing herself out the window (we used to live on the 8th floor), screaming, throwing, i was crying, it was hell. I remember she slapped me once so hard my glasses broke and one of the nose pads broke of so i had crooked glasses for almost a month.

Because of the stress mom would scream at me too when i made any mistakes or if grandma called her at work (she'd call her n amount of times at work for the dumbest reasons: i was wearing black, i wasnot wearing the pants SHE wanted me to wear, i wasn't doing homework when i already finished or didn't have homework etc.) Grandmother was incredibly controlling and would start screaming as soon as i didn't do what SHE wanted me to do. What i dressed with, where i would go, who i talked to etc. She only let me walk to school on my own at 14, up until then she walked me to school, even if it was literally 5 minutes away.

I was cutting viciously at my arm in 6th and 7th grade, would threathen to call the police when i would have a breakdown (which they made me think was a bad thing since they'd ""lock me up"" and other stuff. Telling me i was embarassing them cuz ""the neighbours would hear"" when i was crying and screaming in those breakdowns. In 8th grade it was the worst since i had an important exam that basically settles the fate of students (if they would get into a good highscool, if they would get into the major they wanted etc. You basically have to know what you want to do with the rest of your life at just 14 years old since it's hard to change majors or highschools after). 

During this period it was horrible. Breakdowns and fights would happen almost every 1-2 weeks, name calling, screaming etc. Most of this was coming from my grandmother, my mom just wanted out of the crossfire so she wouldn't do anything. I have also attempted suicide multiple times, by trying to jump out the window (from the 8th floor) and almost letting myself get hit by cars. 

In 9th grade i and mom moved away. Grandmother would still come (we were 7 km away from her house) almost every day or weekend to ""help me with homework"". More fights, more arguing etc. We then finally made her stay away, mom would still insist she should come over in weekends because ""she's family"" (she was ber mother), ""it's just how she is, you can't change elders"", ""she loves you very much"", ""she looked after you and raised you for so many years and you'll abandon her like that?"" etc. 

Mom started being controlling too. I asked her, begged her even to go to a psychologist and a psichiatrist because i needed help but she refused until just a few months ago. She said ""what are THEY gonna do?"" ""They're only after our money"" ""Whatever they can say i can tell you for free"" etc. We also started having fights over me not doing homework even though i did do it and i was an almost straight A student (we have grades from 1-10, and i would only occasionaly get an 8, which i would later fix with good grades anyways). It was never enough, i was never good enough, she'd belittle and argue with me over the most useless things. Again, i was called names and just generally neglected emotionally and mentally. She was only focusing on school, food, and tutoring. She said i was ""wasting her money with my behaviour"" and that i was ""mocking/screwing with her"". I told her i needed help, that i might have depression, that i couldn't take it anymore. My anxiety was so bad when people talked to me, say in the bus and would tell me ""look that seat is empty, do you want to sit down"", just simple things, i would have to walk away because my stomach would tie up in knots. I couldn't speak and i would fumble my words and start sweating and getting scared for no reason. I would be afraid, and still am, of talking with casheers or any unfamiliar person in general. I've been paranoid for years, and still am, though it's gotten better now, thinking that she and grandma are watching me through cameras. I used to think they hid them in the eyes of toys, so i keep all the toys or plushies on my shelf turned away.

I finally went and got help after several panic attacks after the fights we had. Occasionally mom would still force me to go over to grandma's, where, the second i stepped in the house she would start arguing. I would say nothing to her and she just went on and on and on and on. I couldn't take it anymore so i started screaming at her too which would sometimes result in panic attacks. While i was on the floor, hyperventilating, unable to stand up because i couldn't feel my legs or arms and because i was so dizzy, she'd yell at me to ""cut it out"" ""get up"" and even nudged me with her foot. It would make me so angry and it only got worse. Were i able to stand up, i would have killed her because at that moment i just wanted her to shut up. All i heard was screams and loud noise and i could feel, hear and see EVERYTHING. Everything, every sensation and emotion was amplified and i couldn't handle it. I once threathened to kill myself with a large kitchen knife. She called an ambulance and the medics were sympathetic towards me. I and mom refused to be taken into the hospital, because since i threathened to kill myself it could appear on my medical record. Several medics (emergency was called multiple times) told her to stop stressing me but she wouldn't listen cuz one was ""young so he must be freshly graduated and doesn't know what they're talking about"" or ""he's an arab so he's dumb"" etc. 

I've been somewhat succesful in cutting ties with her and after both me and my psychologist insisting to not force me to make contact with her anymore, mom finally stopped (not completely, she still rarely wants to bring grandma over or wants me to go over to help her) forcing me to interact with her.

Mom is still a problem. She refuses or is just not able to understand mental issues. She keeps asking why i'm tired, why i'm so mad all the time but if i start trying to explain what i feel, making myself vulnerable in front of her she shuts it down with ""you just read that on the internet"". This is another problem. She blames everything on me using my phone ""all day"", when the people i talk to on my phone (friends, friends of friends etc.) supported me through dark times better than she ever did. 

She is trying to change, she did change, but only a little. She still doesn't understand that i am still hurting. She keeps guilt-tripping me. Telling me i'm ""mocking her"" or wasting her money and that ""she invested so much in me"" (we recently payed for a lot of courses in game dev since that is what i want to do. She never supported me with my drawing and art until a few months ago since i started doing art commissions and earning money. Up until then she'd keep telling me to ""draw prettier things"" or ""stop drawing those nasty things"". I'd draw monsters and stuff like that. Anatomy and biology fascinates me so i like creating various creatures and monsters). She probably thinks i'll get a well paying job and give her money too. Although she never said it, she hinted at it sometimes. I also think she and dad made me to get american citizenship. I have american citizenship and from what i heard and know i can sponsor them for immigration at 21 yrs old or something like that.

I feel nothing now. I am always so tired. I can't sleep because of all the thoughts in my bead. It can take me up to 4 hours to fall asleep. I can't feel anything except anger, loneliness and jealousy. I can never be happy for a longer period of time, say, 3-4 days. If i go out with friends i'm just happy then and then as soon as i leave it passes. I want to be happy. She and grandma, especially grandma, now irritate me whenever they talk to me. I can't stand them. They've taken everything from me, even my feelings. I can't feel empathy towards people, nothing. I know it's bad, because i wasn't like this before. I was normal. But now there's nothing. If a friend were to be killed in front of me i would feel nothing. I understand what happened is bad, but i simply can't feel anything for them. I have next to no social skills, and longer social interactions simply exhaust me. Meds didn't work. I took zoloft 50mg and my head hurt horribly. It severely affected my school performance, to the point where i asked my teachers to not count the tests i took while on that medication because my grades would be destroyed, and since my country is horrible and has very little opportunity, you have to have almost perfect grades to get a chance for scholarships or stuff like that, since few can pay for college. 

Mom would even get mad at me for wanting to go at the doctor for things (because life happens) to the point i'm now afraid of asking to go to the doctor, so i usually wait until it gets worse to tell her (she still gets mad.) Health care here is free, so i don't understand what she gets so mad about.

She also doesn't approve that i am homosexual. Saying that ""i just read it on the internet"" when i've known for years that i liked girls, not boys, way before all the lgbtq stuff wave hit our country.

I feel very lonely. I have little to no physical contact and i want to feel warmth. I'm to afraid to ask my friends for hugs and when they do hug or touch me in any way i shut down because i just don't know how to react/respond. During vacations or holidays it gets worse. School somewhat distracts me from the loneliness but during breaks and holidays i mostly stay at home, alone, so a huge wave of loneliness overcomes me.

We've gotten a second dog, a shiba inu, to keep me company. She is incredibly intelligent and actually made me feel better for a while. But now mom locks her in the garden and intends to leave her there forever. She took away one of the last few things that brought me joy. Because ""she's making a mess"" even though she never chewed, never peed on the carpet, never did any big mess. I also wanted to clean up after whatever mess she claimed she makes but she still wanted to throw her out.

I know mom is very stressed because of her work. She works almost 12 hours a day. But still, i don't think she has a right to just. Break me like this. Everyone in the family just dumps their own stress on top of me. I can't take it anymore. I just want to feel relaxed and happy for one day. I can't even cry anymore, not even when i want to, not even when i need to. And what bothers me mostly is that she blames everything on ""thst damned phone"" and she denies everything i tell her. She denies things she said mere minutes ago.

I want to leave the country as soon as possible. I want to cut all ties with her or grandma and just live my life. I wanted to call cps on her several times. Only reason i didn't is because of all the horror stories i heard from orphanages, in case they did take me away from her (children being molested, raped, beaten etc) Should i have called them? Am i in the right? It feels like i have 2 voices, one that knows i'm right and one that doubts it because mom and grandma have filled me with doubt for as long as i can remember. I can't make decisions on my own or take an unatural amount of time to decide over the simplest of things. What should i do? Is this really neglect? What can i do to escape this horrible loneliness. I've been thinking about ending it again, in the is past month. I keep getting horrible, hyper-realistic dreams. I've killed and i've been killed countless times. I was burned, beaten, skinned, gutted and raped. I've been getting horrible thoughts lately and i am afraid i might hurt myself or someone else and ruin my future. I want this to end. I'm so so tired. Please, any help or advice is appreciated. I'm afraid i won't make it to 18 year if things keep going like this.",24Jul2019,5

93,"I’m dating a 30 year old man who suffers from anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and ADHD.

I introduced him to my family but my mom thinks that he’s not “normal“ and have serious mental issues. We went to vacations with my family and in car, he looked sideways at my mother for a long time and looked to her feet (like if he was analysing her). He can’t see that doing that is creepy and make people feel uncomfortable. He does the same with me, keeps staring me a lot of time eye-wided and analyses my clothes.

Nothing really makes me that sad. I don't know if I should get help or if this is normal.  

A streamer I really like died recently and I didn't feel anything. I watched that man for years, I practically grew up with him but nothing I wasn't sad or angry. I tried to force myself to cry or be sad or anything but nothing.

95,"I’ve been struggling to get treatment for my mental health for years now. My mother who doesn’t believe in therapy, has told me for years that I’m strong enough to deal with things on my own and that asking for help is looking for attention. 

Finally, after going off to college I’ve had the courage and ability to start seeking out resources to start to deal with my depression and other issues. Last year, I got Neuropsychological testing done and was diagnosed with Major Depression, ADHD, and I scored high enough that the doctor wanted to rule out Borderline Personality Disorder. During my diagnosis the man who worked with me was one of the first people to look at me and tell me he understood that I was struggling. He gave me hope that I wasn’t crazy or making it up, and that it could be something I could fix. During the appointment, the Dr. made it a point to explain Borderline Personality Disorder to me. He started by asking me what I knew and explained that there were a lot of misconceptions surrounding it. At the time, I hadn’t known much and he made sure to tell me where to find proper information about. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I started to see therapists with my testing results in hand. It baffles me as to why getting treatment for mental health is such a difficult process. The first therapist I saw looked me in the eyes after reading my results that stated I have extremely high levels of depression, say, « Well you don’t look like you’re sad, so what is the issue » I never went back. The second the therapist I saw really got to me though. When going through the intake items, i listed the diagnoses from my testing, which she was happily scribbling down until I said BPD. Upon which, she proceeded to refuse that I had it. Mind you, i have only known this woman for 10 mins as this was our first visit. She said there was no way I could have BPD because people like that are awful people and she would have know the second I came in, if I had it. It now made sense why my first Dr. went out of his way to explain the miscommunications. I’m so angry because how dare a mental health professional act that way about a condition. It really bothers me that she could be like that and also have just the flawed way of thinking that having BPD makes you a bad person.",24Jul2019,1

97,"Hi there,

ever since my mom left home, I grew up quick. I learned to handle most stuff, so when I moved out of home at 19, I already knew how to live as a ""grown-up"", including stuff like taxes etc.

But I feel like I get worse every year.

I cannot even handle the smallest things anymore. I just took a week off because I want to get my shit together and, dang it, this stuff would not have piled up 5 years ago.

I know I need therapy and I am on a waiting list. I just need to vent. I am looking at myself and I think ""What the hell happened to you?"" The older I get, the harder it gets for me to be responsible. It is not just huge stuff, even small stuff seems overwhelming these days.

I could always visit my boyfriend, but I do not want to rely on him, since I know I will not get anything done then. I need to be alone for this, but everything feels so hard, while I know these are actually simple tasks and I hate myself for being so stupid. I lost so much money because of my depression, it hurts.",24Jul2019,21

99,"Hi,

Recently, a close family member started showing signs of delusion (e.g. delusional grandiose thoughts). This was precipitated by a traumatic life event that is still underway. I don't want to go into too much detail to maintain as much anonymity as possible.

He is isolated from other family members, and I am the only one who regularly checked in on him and hung out (e.g. getting lunch, going for runs, etc.). 

One day he started saying things that made no sense. I just thought he was tired from lack of sleep and high stress from work and the traumatic life event.

Over the last few weeks the delusional thoughts have intensified, culminating to a point where I had to say something to him. I realize now that I didn't handle the situation appropriately; I said he was most likely suffering from psychosis and that what he was thinking was not the case.

He got defensive and started calling me a snake, and that he had known for a while that I was. I've given him thousands of dollars to help through his turmoil, spent quality time with him, and told him I love him and that I will help him through this. I told him that I don't want the money back, and that he would have done the same for me if it had been me in his situation. He, in fact, has helped me in the past when I was going through a rough life transition.

I don't know what to do. I'm not worried about him hurting anyone, but I am worried that he might hurt himself.

103,"I've suffered with depression probably since I was a teenager and I'm actively working on my mental health and for a long time, I felt like I was at a place where I was able to cope with my thoughts and feelings and knowing how to properly take care of myself. After university I lived with my mum for a year in a city where I have lots of family and friends, and then last month I moved in with my partner of 4 years into a house that's in the valleys, because his dad owns a bunch of properties and he said we could rent it for a while, then take over the mortgage and then sell it on if we wanted to. This seemed like a really good opportunity for us to not be stuck with renting properties for the rest of our lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, since moving in, I've been feeling isolated and lonely, overwhelmed by the amount of work the house needs doing, and like I'm no longer in a team in my relationship. I feel like most of the burden of general housework and upkeep (like and laundry dishes etc) and then the painting/decorating sort of DIY house stuff is all falling on me. I feel like things to do with the house aren't getting done unless I ask my partner to do them so I'm feeling a bit like a parent to my boyfriend. I'm feeling really isolated because my friends and family are now a 50-minute drive away from my house and I don't really know many people here other than my partner's parents and his cousins. I made a bunch of new friends from doing exercise dance classes before moving home and now I'm feeling like moving here was a huge mistake and I don't know what to do about it.

I've moved away from home twice now, once with an ex, and that was like 5 hours away, and once for university which was an hour away from my friends and family.

When I went in I was maybe a 7 on a fuckthisshiti'mnotok scale from 1 to 10, when I was there I got better to a.. 4? I was genuenly happy with my meds (50 zoloft, Xanax and 100 galabentin). Then I got home and I'm on a constant 8 to 9.

To explain, I haven't a precise illness or condition, I have a personality disorder, cptsd, panic and anxiety problems, phobia.. They said I'm faceted like a diamond and they cannot put a label on that.
My psichiatrist is not responding to my texts, and I have no psychological help yet (just my old one).

I have been reading the ""healing developmental trauma"" book I was suggested on here and found it helpful, especially the Autonomy Survival Style, that I'm convinced is 80% of my issues. I think is easily found on a Google search but basically I have difficulty setting limits and boundaries, I avoid conflicts and try to please others and for that I am deeeeeply resentful even if I don't recognize it.

I agreed that these were problems, and said I would actively work to improve on these areas and I was so happy he brought these up so I could work on them.

Then after a couple days, he said he needed some time and went to a friends house for two days. When he got back, we had a very long talk and he agreed to work on things together.

Then two days after this (which was last Friday), he told me that he actually needs time away again, and that he needed to see if he misses me. He packed a bag, said he would need three weeks and left. I have tried to maintain some contact, but he has not been very responsive. I have reached out to two of his friends, and they are trying to monitor his well-being.

&amp;#x200B;

25-year-old male here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I keep experiencing frequent episodes of overwhelming and crippling emotions that just makes me want to end it all. Last night I popped some Xanax and fell asleep. Woke up super late, spent the entire day in a haze.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been suffering from depression for quite a while. It wasn't serious, but it's something both my mother and her mother has. That, plus anxiety issues. From time to time, I had to take medication. Things started to get worse after I finished college. Right out of college, I got a job, but I wanted to get into a masters program after my bachelors, I always wanted to stay in academics. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things got worse right after I left the job and started studying to get into a masters program. I was all alone, stuck at home. I never had a lot of friends. At the same time, my girlfriend of six years (and my only friend) finished college and got into a job. It was quite taxing and she didn't have time for me. Slowly, isolation crept in. Along with that, the depression worsened. My girlfriend was my only valid support system and she slowly distanced herself from me. She wanted to prioritize her career, it's understandable. However, seeing her having fun with her colleagues also made me jealous. Over the year, I started to depend on medication more and more. I also gained weight. By the end of December 2018, I weighed 96 kilograms (172cm). My relationship of six years decayed into nothingness, I had no friends, my family was never quite there. The isolation worsened. I was on constant medication by this time.

&amp;#x200B;

These sudden overwhelming episodes became more and more frequent. I spent nights awake, alone, crying. I decided that I had to do something. I spent most of my fellowship money on buying a gravel bike. I started riding. I decided to ride a total of a thousand kilometers by the end of the year, and I also (stupidly) stopped taking my meds. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it worked.

&amp;#x200B;

By mid-April 2019, I already rode 500 kilometers on my bike, lost around 15 kilograms. I started working out at home too. I kinda' became obsessed with the numbers on the weight machine and the cyclometer. The episodes became less and less frequent, but they were always there. I completed my masters with quite a decent grade and got into a Ph.D. program. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, I became a close friend with a girl I used to know from college. She left the country in December 2018 but we stayed in touch, even helped her get a job abroad. And there's when it started again. As she slowly got into her job, I started feeling alone again. She stopped texting unless she needed me. And I stopped texting because I didn't want to appear as a needy person. Seeing her having fun when I was being suffocated by this isolation made me angry too. I know it's completely unreasonable but I'm just stating what I felt. I  didn't give up on cycling, completing 960 kilometers by early-July 2019, and got my weight down to 79 kilograms. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I always wanted to get into research, at this moment, I am not enjoying this Ph.D. Doctoral programs can be quite lonely and stressful. Being an introvert, my social life at work is also nearly non-existent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I feel like I'm at the fringe of everyone's social circle. I'm someone no one truly cares about. I've always been that nice guy, the one who's always available when needed. I feel alone, angry, and used. It's been two weeks I didn't go out cycling. Nothing seems to give me a sense of meaning or purpose. I don't know what to do. I don't want to get back on medication either.",24Jul2019,1

131,"I don’t know if this will help anyone, but I wanted to put my experience out there for anyone who could use it.

2 years ago I was mentally drained, constantly anxious, and felt completely helpless. I was stressed out of my mind over academic related problems, along with family issues and an overall sense of existential dread. I felt like I was running out of time for everything.

I came really close to killing myself. Thought about it a lot, wondered how much it would hurt if I just stabbed myself with a kitchen knife.

The main reason that I didn’t was the unfinished business I had here on earth.

It occurred to me that I did not want to die without seeing the next Marvel movie. Then I realized I had dozens of webtoon comics I wanted to see the end of. And I hadn’t caught up on my favorite TV shows. There were books on my own shelf that I hadn’t read.

Books, comics, movies and TV provide an entertaining escape from our lives. In some ways, it’s like alcohol or drugs, but without the side affects.

In the same way people drink to escape their reality, I used most of my free time to immerse myself into the series that I loved.

My problems didn’t disappear, and my mental health was not magically tip top shape the next day, but it was a start. 

It’s been almost 2 years since I wanted to kill myself. 

Maybe it’s pathetic, but I am alive and in a better place mentally because of my drive to see the endings of my favorite shows, comics, and books.

This might not help anyone, but if it gives you hope, I credit my survival to me being a really good couch potato. Be positive, be productive, and binge watch Netflix in your free time 💛",24Jul2019,1

141,"So I have always had difficulty even attempting to do a Google search or even study on what my mental problems actually are. I'm obviously paranoid but my visual ""hallucinations"" dont seem to match any diagnosed thing I know.

I'm 21 and currently living with my fiance. I have been diagnosed with adhd, depression,  anxiety, paranoia and potentially bipolar. I am aware that some of my problems are just paranoia but it's the way some things occur that I cant quite seem to understand

 Whenever I'm with anyone that I know I am completely fine most of the time, however when I am alone or feel unsafe/paranoid I tend to get a couple of different symptoms like mild hallucinations and paranoid thoughts that seem so real in my head that I can almost perfectly imagine it happening to the point it almost seems like it will, but obviously in reality I never physically see anything. On top of that I see things out of the corner of my eyes and sometimes it's just a shape but sometimes it's like a blurry person running past. I can NEVER look directly at a hallucination because it's never there, only in my corner vision do I see things. Sometimes it's an object that I perceived as a person or something other than itself. So only ever seeing things that I cant look at is a little rough, but not only that when I'm in a dark room i feel like i can see shadows and objects morphing. Not necessarily changing shape completely but only the borders or vague shape morph and sometimes grow. Dark spots all the sudden can be terrifying if I dont stare at them because my corner vision will see things in the dark, and even in the light if I'm in the bathroom and the glass door is slid shut and my clothes are on the floor, I can see them slightly morph just vaguely like they are living blobs and I fear them. But if I look directly at them it's fine.

143,"I grew up in a pretty hostile home. Regular physical and verbal abuse. In my late 20s, I still don’t really have any relationship with my dad. 

I had a girlfriend in high school and through most of college. I felt safety, comfort, love, and trust with her that I don’t think I’d ever really felt in my life before. I was sure I wanted to marry her. Our breakup wrecked me. 

For a long time, I was sure I wouldn’t ever love anyone again, and I’m still in a place where I’m not really sure what love actually is or how to know you’ve got it. And I think I’ve felt a pit in my stomach ever since. First because I missed my ex, but later—once that passed and I’d moved on—the residual depression of feeling isolated and scared of love never really passed.

While I’ve dated a few people since, I hadn’t been able to say “I love you” to anyone for about five years since. Not even to my own mother. In the past year, I’ve started to say “you too” when my mum says “I love you,” and sometimes—and this breaks my heart—she replies with, “thanks.” You shouldn’t have to thank me for that, mom. It’s still a bit too much for me to say the whole thing out loud (to anybody) even though I love my mom a lot.

I should note that even when I was in grade school, I had trouble getting over childhood crushes until years later. 

Needless to say, in the years since college, I’ve left a wake of hurt people behind me, and reflecting on my last relationship has really woken me up to how much of a problem I’ve got and how much pain I’ve caused, and it makes me feel terrible. At the same time, I don’t know how to crawl out of my mental prison.

I know my reaction to that breakup wasn’t normal. But it’s not like I can just go, “that wasn’t normal, so I’m all better now.” So I’d like to get help—maybe I can’t fix myself, but if I can identify what the hell’s wrong with me, maybe I can feel less crushingly alone and maybe I can protect other people from me.

145,"Long story short: Back in 2017, I was being treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for my OCD, which I've struggled with since my adolescence (I am turning 29 next month).  I also have a history of depression and anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

During the course of seeing this therapist, my anxiety and OCD/obsessive thoughts worsened to the point that I pretty much became manic and suicidal.  I expressed this to the therapist and told him that I felt I needed to be hospitalized.  He told me that there was no where for me to go and that if I went to an emergency room they would ""knock me out and cold"" and send me home in a day or two, if that.  Well, it turns out he was wrong and I ended up finding a hospital to go to thanks to a friend of mine, and I was hospitalized for a month.  When I called this therapist from the hospital to tell him I was there, he never called me back and I never heard back from him.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I am traumatized by what I experienced in the months leading up to my hospitalization.  This therapist essentially had me going back for more sessions so that I could keep giving him money (he charged $150-$175 per session and did not accept insurance).  Had I been given proper advice sooner, I don't think I would have spent a month in the hospital and missed a month of work.  I have nightmares almost every night of my recurring anxiety and being taken to the hospital again.

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for 3 years. 

My ex wore me down and made me feel like I had all these mental issues which were just manifestations of how they treated and regarded me. 

I went to a psychiatrist and dealt with trying all these different medications to handle “me being bipolar” but none of these meds really worked.

I finally was able to get out the relationship after I realized I wasn’t the problem and that the relationship was abusive and I was just mentally exhausted. 

When I split from my ex, I stopped taking the meds I was on. Told my doctor. And proceeded to make my life better again being single. 

Everything completely flipped post-breakup. I was happier. I was hanging out with my friends again. I wasn’t moody and sad all the time anymore. My family was floored when they saw how different I was was outside of this relationship. Overall, I felt like I did before. Which was normal. 

About 8 months after the breakup, I went back to the doctor and told him I didn’t think I was actually bipolar at all and that the relationship was what was driving me over the edge. We talked about getting the diagnosis removed and moving on without medication.

158,"Hello, I wasn't sure if it would be better to post here or in another subreddit, but I thought I'd try here first. 

I've had trouble with my mental health for a long time now. Despite seeking help from multiple sources, most of my problems are self-diagnosed rather than professionally labeled. So, I'm looking online to see if I can find more details about an aspect of my depression that I can't really find any info about!

Sometimes when I'm pretty deep in depression I have this moment where it just goes away like a snap. It happens within seconds and I don't know if it is caused by outside events or not. I feel like sometimes I'm just not doing anything in particular when it happens. I don't know if that's true, though. It doesn't happen often, and sometimes it doesn't last long. Last time it lasted a day. Sometimes it lasts until depression gradually sets in again.

It is such an odd sensation, and it feels like a light switch was flipped. I can still picture how the world looked and felt before, but it feels like I have so much more clarity and potential. It feels like the world lost the gray fuzziness that tinged it before and my thoughts are positive. I don't think it's mania, but I don't know much about that spectrum of depressive disorders. It's more like I can think about making something I enjoy for dinner and be happy at the idea and feel like I am able to do it. 

This aspect makes me have trouble with some of the CBT ideas of changing how you think. When I try to think positively when I'm super depressed my brain turns it around and makes it negative, and other times I am positive without thinking about it.

I don't control this reaction, but I was hoping that it could give me a hint of what might help me to improve.

I think my main question is how this relates to depression and if anyone else has had this experience. My therapist thinks it's mostly situational depression. I don't disagree with that, but I wonder if that is all there is to it. Is there a particular type of depression that has this aspect?

163,"It all started in middle school, I was doin fine on my first day of school actually, I had a few of my old schoolmates with me and made some new ones along the way and through out the school year, things were goin fine!... That when until the bullying and strange behavior started. There were some people that I couldn't stand and sometime I just feel uncomfortable when I'm around, sometimes there are people that tease me a bit but sometimes take it TOO far, And most of the time were just... I don't even know. And then there were the anxiety attacks in the hall and y symptoms of **ASD** kickin in. Which led me to the desirable urge to switch schools. IDK why but, I just felt like I hated **EVERY-SINGLE-THING** about it. I even gave my speech teacher a suicide note and blame the reason on one of my new friends.... So, even tho 6th grade wasn't at it greatest year point, it was still enjoyable. But, then came 7th grade where my urging wish actually came true... A school with a smaller setting (which was the thing I was technically askin for) with... MENTALLY AND BEHAVIORALLY CHALLENGED PEERS. Ik I have a disability but it ain't SEVERE like them. After awhile, the school I went to was a ""SPECIALIZED PROGRAM"" and It made me learn valuable lessons on ""Don't judge a book by it cover"" (Which me and many others will still not hold a grasp on the quote) , to get a **BETTER** explanation of the school beforehand, and learn the concept of ""You get what you get and you **DON'T** get upset""!.... 

&amp;#x200B;

7th grade was fine for a little bit till we got to the part of realization. Kids were so awkward and weird compared to me, we did past grade work instead of current grade work (and there was **NOTHING** on **ANY SUBJECT** that I've learned in my previous school), sometimes kids get super upset at someone and they start tryin to leave the building which was the first time I saw a kid get apprehended for something that was beating someone up, and most of all... the graduation system. The goal in that school was to prove that any of get to go back into a regular ed setting. But, it can only be proven by how we do in  **BEHAVIOR**. (Which sounds way too much of an elementary thing to me) Especially, when we had to wear our elementary uniforms yet again, like seriously. I almost had thoughts that people think I got held WAY back. I plead and plead to take my decision back and go back to OG school but, everytime it always **NO.** They said that no further transferring can be done. So, I had to endure for the remaining semester... It was rough but I almost made it through. But, there was **ONE** student I would wish death upon, cursed on, or maybe even just full on erased from this world. (I'm not gonna say the name tho) Everytime I'm with him, It like I'm looking at a stained, disgusted,annoying version of myself. Someone I never wanted to become. But, I felt my whole life ending when I felt a weird sensation in my left ear when walkin pass him. When I turned around he was straight up talkin and I thought ""Did somethin from his mouth flew into my ear"" That was the only reason. But, everytime I went to a doctor they would **ALWAYS** tell me that ""There nothin in there"" but.... I know deep down that there is. But, after graduation I finally thought that I could make a new fresh start in high school and life would go back to normal but... It didn't. Over time I still was thinking about that piece of food that was stuck in my left ear for a few years that no one can see AT ALL. It only took me awhile to just leave it up to the ENT specialists to get the job done. But, it was already too late. I felt that his saliva,DNA,and whatever junk from that bit of food converted from my ear to my brain makin me feel.... Broken. Lost. Mindless. And... Depressed. I was severely depressed but, I never thought of it until I actually went to therapy. I took some anti-depressants and I felt them wrkin but, to me.... not enough. After a few sessions, my psychiatrist told me that ""There stuff in your ear that protects it from debris and.... maybe you were just doubting yourself for it."" I felt her words hatchin my brain like an egg and finally letting it see the light for the first time ever. I gotten my realization yet, I still knew deep down that it might've bee too late still. Soon after that therapy session, I felt myself comin around and feelin like I'm finally me again. And had a miraculous improvement on my communication,speech,motor functions, ETC. But, on July 22nd, everything fell apart yet again. It was the day of our therapy session and I was ready to go yet... I hadn't bathed yet. I told her that I would bathe tomorrow, but Mom being Mom ranted about the principles of bathing oneself and that no one wants to be around a smelly person. But, I smelt decent and there was nothin bad so she was just over-exaggerating. But, then I realized that I wasn't in the need of therapy today so, I told her to cancel today and reschedule for another time cause again, I was miraculously improving on my own but, She just wouldn't quit. After a few disputes and arguments, I gave in and took the shower already... **BIG MISTAKE.** I hadn't bathed oftenly at my grandma's house (which is where I was stayin for the summer) but, for a good yet sanitary reason cause I was kind-of a complicated germaphobe and I was skeptical about most of my past germs from previously used products. Especially my bathing sponge and bar soap, in my grandma's house. I thought the best way to ensure nothin bad go wrong, I washed my bar soap with some rubbing alcohol. I thought that did the trick but, at the same time it didn't cause I forgot my bath sponge. I did wash it a few times but there were still some body hair and dirts from my nails that got cleaned because of it. Now, I felt like my old self again (And not the good kind) The self that should've been dead by now after all that has happened until this point. So, I felt like my mom washed away all my improvement down the drain. I told her I was done with the appointment and went back inside... I just wanted to cry in my sleep and do it for the next few days but, me havin ASD, that didn't happen. So, in conclusion my life is complicated, my mind doesn't know when to grow up and thanks to that food chunk (which was kind of removed thanks to the specialists) I got a mild Ear Infection which I thought was a Fly Stuck in my ear. Can somebody please tell me what this germaphobic, ASDing, life ruining symptom or illness or WHATEVER it is, IS?!

165,"So, I have been having some side effects from anti anxiety medications and I tired to talk to my current doctor about this twice, in case of changing it. I tired talking to another doctor about the same issue, they treat me like I am a person who wants to go off medication. I am thinking that since 2 people good at their jobs and told me the same thing, it is a red flag about me. The thing is, I believe medication works for me, but each time I take this, I feel intense things for half an hour, or at moments during the day. I was thinking maybe I was overreacting, but the truth is that with previous medications I didn't have these problems. They tell me that maybe mistakenly I think it is the medication's problem. But no one ever explains anything else to me, maybe if you told me what happens and why I think this happens and why it doesn't it would be better? On the other hand, I am not an educated doctor and doctors don't have to explain everything to patients. 

So, is it ok for the patient to want to change medicine? Is this a sign of denial to therapy?",24Jul2019,1
166," My mom is a very sensitive woman and she has a ton of things on her shoulders. She desperately needs a therapist. The problem is that my dad is very controlling with finances and can be emotionally abusive when it comes to money. He would never allow her to spend any money on therapy. Their church offers financial support to people in need of therapy, but my dad makes a fair amount of money, so she doesn't qualify for their financial assistance. Also, the church leaders are all friends with my dad, so when my mom has gone to the pastor one on one for counsel/support with the stresses of her marriage, they don't believe her because they all think my dad is such a great guy. How can I get my mom some emotional support/professional help?",24Jul2019,2
