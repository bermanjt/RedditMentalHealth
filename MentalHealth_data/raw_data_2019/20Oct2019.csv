0,"So I became friends with a guy in my class a few weeks ago. I was really excited to have a friend. We both smoked and it was really fun in the beginning. The more I’ve gotten to know him and the more time I’ve spent with him, the more triggering I’ve found him. He’s eerily similar to my brother and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. Lately he’s been bringing up his emotions in a way that starts off joking and then like all of a sudden gets serious and dark. I can’t quite explain it, but it feels physically painfully uncomfortable. I hate it, and he keeps asking to hang out. How do I go about this? We share a small class until probably mid-December. We’re in the same major so it’s likely that we’ll run into each other frequently. I’ve never been in this situation so I have absolutely 0 idea how to handle this. I’d be fine hanging out with him with other people around- it’s just 1-on-1 that’s starting to be unbearable. I’m at a loss at what to do?",20Oct2019,1
1,"I'm looking for counseling services for someone close to me and the process has been nothing short of infuriating. 

This person has had multiple serious suicide attempts in the last year and hasn't seen a counselor since and I have been trying to find a counselor for some time. 

I've called multiple offices and left messages and heard a lot of ""you'll be hearing back from is soon"", but they've rarely actually returned any of my calls. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on ways to help nail down services for someone? 

The person in question is on Medicare for the time being, so that greatly narrows down the field we can look for, but any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",20Oct2019,1
2,"Hi. This is the first time I’ve ever posted something like this but I’ve been feeling a little trapped recently, so I am hoping reaching out to others may help. I’ve been dealing with depression for over a year and a half now, and so far there’s no end in sight. I know that sounds bad to say, but it’s true. I wish I was happier, but don’t we all. I admit, I don’t think that the world would be much different without me in it; it will keep spinning and life will go on, just not with me there. It happens everyday. But, I hope I get to be there. I don’t know if anyone else feels like this, but if you do, know that you’re not alone. I know that doesn’t seem like much (I don’t think it is), but you have yourself. Even with all the bad thoughts that don’t ever seem to disappear, at least you’re having them. It means you’re still here. Breathing. Every breath shows that you’re still here. Even if it doesn’t feel like it. So, just try. Try to keep breathing and maybe it will get better someday. I hope you keep fighting, and I hope I do too. Let’s try together.",20Oct2019,27
3,"Sometimes , after a build up of overwhelming emotions or absolutely nothing at all, I get this horrible sensation like a surge of adrenaline to bash my head against a wall so hard I pass out, shake my limbs uncontrollably, to scream at the top of my lungs and rip at my hair and break my own hands. Urges to jump off the bridge I'm walking past and then I'll try to but come to my senses. Urges to pour all that burning hot oil all over my arms. And when I'm around people, I get urges to hurt those around me. Like, ""stab that person"". ""Shake that baby or drop and step on them until they're screaming"". ""Slap her so hard she cries"". ""Bash his head against a wall"". ""Beat him up"".

Its like an itch I can't scratch and it scares me that one day I'll do something. I don't want to hurt people. I really don't. It's not like I *could* hurt someone anyway - I'm 5'0 and weak as hell. But in those moments it feels like something deep in my body trying to surface and that makes me want to scream so fucking loud.",20Oct2019,1

5,"My girlfriend has had anxiety her whole life and depression for over a year, and occasionally she'll go into sudden a depressive state where her voice gets a bit higher, she gets very energetic, laughs at things that aren't funny, and when I talk to her while she's in this state she says that she is laughing about how worthless she is. Sometimes I can manage to talk her out of it after a while, but she truly seems like a different person when she gets like this in basically every way. To anyone else it seems like she's just extra energetic and even happy, but when I talk to her it's clear that she in an absolutely terrible state of mind, and truly believes that she is worthless. Plus, after she gets out of this state, she has absolutely no memory of it or anything that happened while she was in it. I've searched online for what this could possibly be but I haven't found anything. Does anyone know what this is? Does she have some personality disorder? Is this common?",20Oct2019,2

7,"# Before I start I want to state that I'm a 15 year old male and ""depression"" is typical around my age group so you can take that into consideration but please, any feedback would be appreciated!

I have always felt alienated from friends and family although I have lots. I've always been the therapist friend and had to deal with other peoples shit for hours on end. It came to the point where I just ended up blocking my friends because i couldn't handle all the pressure anymore.

I often contemplate suicide and ended up writing a note last month on the 19th.  I was going to jump off a water tower the next day. I went to multiple friends and got help from one but everyone else just shrugged it off saying stuff like ""don't be stupid"". This tears me apart because no one ever gives back to me after I have put so much time and effort into helping them. I get shit on wile everyone else keeps moving without helping. At this point I lost all faith in God and found life meaningless.  

I feel like no one understands me, they all think of life in such a linear way and I can't reach out to anyone when I say there is no point to life. They might think they get it but if they truly did they would be thinking how I do. 

I think that after death is the same as before you were born, a void of nothingness so whats there to be scared of. We live in a society where we're told whats right and wrong when there is absolutely no point to anything. There are no good and bad guys but just people who exist for no reason. Everyone and everything you love will one day die. There is no point to go on but i don't want to die right now.  I'm okay with death if it confronts because I know that I'll eventually die on day. I see no wrong with chaos because nothing you do matters. I'm always sad but I can temporarily experience happiness through laughter and being with certain people but I just go back to being sad.

I feel alone not from the fact that I'm misunderstood. I like to believe that I'm mature for my age and that I think very logically. No one my age that i have talked to can really comprehend what I'm saying. I have an IQ of 131 but I don't bother to do anything besides smoke weed or drink. I started being extra nice to people so I can feel like I'm making a difference but I know that I'm not. I want to be remembered when I did but I know that is not possible. I became very pessimistic after I stopped believing in god because I know that Optimism just sets you up for failure. Everyday I live in constant pain of just feeling nothingness, I started taking more risks and almost got railed by a school bus and it didn't phase me because I just don't care.",20Oct2019,1

10,"This past year has been a constant downward spiral for me. Suicidal thoughts, broken heart, lost friends, all the time I felt more and more angry, sad, confused and lost.

If I feel less sad, or almost happy, I try to remember why I felt that way, and theres nothing. Now Im getting a job, trying to move on with my life, but everything I do just adds to the weight. I feel, dead. I don't really have it left in me to really *live* at this point, because it feels like everything good in my life has ended. Its this constant feeling, *knowing*, that I feel nothing, I have nothing, I AM nothing anymore. And I don't know how I can keep going on.",20Oct2019,1
11,A good idea to choose this body to be born in I can’t talk to my doctor about this cause she will say your schizophrenic and I’m not a doctor thought I was schizophrenic before and I proved him wrong laughing so much on how they thought I heard voices which I didn’t do I took the medicine and after that I started hearing shit which was not fun they had to give me a sleeping shot to put me asleep and then in the morning I didn’t hear anything any voices so I told my doctor what the medicine did to me and he said I just wanted to try it and I told him how it made me feel and he said that I’m not schizophrenic and that he was wrong I hate life I have a okay life but I hate it so much I can’t meditate worth of shit I try and try and try and what happens My third eye doesn’t open I need to know who I am the only way to do that and become psychic and a medium is through meditation i need to see my dog she died in February 2018 she was dead at 3:57 and the only way to do that is to open my third eye which I can’t even seem to do that I used to be able to do that I almost had it open before a couple of times before but I quit meditating and my third eye closed and I stoped seeing spirits and being psychic again not schizophrenic so don’t call me that it’s called new age one doesn’t just develop schizophrenia through meditation do your research on third eye and meditation and esp abilities before you call me a schizophrenic I am normal I don’t hear voices I don’t see things I don’t have delusions and I don’t believe everyone is out to get me I don’t do drugs alcohol I’m not addicted to anything and my brain works fine accept not having a conscious having a little voice in my head tell me what I’m doing is wrong and I should stop which I’m talking about me my voice not some schizophrenic voice I don’t want to die and I don’t want to live I am not suicidal I am not depressed I don’t have anxiety or any other mental health problems,20Oct2019,1

13,"I met someone 4 years ago who I felt was one of the sweetest, kindest people on earth. They would do anything for me. Four years later, the entire story has changed.  She is basically the opposite of what she portrayed.  I fell seriously ill in the summertime. It was so bad, I started losing my hair, was severely weak, could barely put on my shoes, etc.  I had to stop working.

She got mad at me for getting sick. She didn't believe me even though I have blood work to prove it. She expected me to do everything I was doing before and belittled me when I couldn't.  I went to sleep most nights wondering if I would wake up the next day.

Granted, this behavior didn't START here. It peaked here.  Over the course of 4 years it went from fragile and shy to bullying and threatening.

I didn't want to get sick. I didn't want to stop working. But, my god, this is NOT the person I met 4 years ago. They are the exact opposite.

Every time I stand up for myself, she threatens my livelihood, breaks my stuff, threatens eviction.  Even though I'm working from home and making income (even while being sick).  Every time I open my mouth, she gets mad at me.  There's no talking. There's no ""working it out"". She is never wrong. It's always my fault. There's no apologies. Nothing.  She spit in my face and hit me in the mouth a few days ago.

I -know- this is abuse. But, our lives are so tied up together and my health still isn't stable enough to work full time and move out. And I love her son.  Oh, and since I had to stop working for a period of time, now I'm ""using her"". And if I didn't mention before, I still have an income because I'm doing everything I can to bring money in -WHILE- being sick.

You just can't win.  And I can't even believe someone would treat someone this way.  Yet, I feel guilty... because she has supported me in some ways, but has abused me severely in others.",20Oct2019,2

15,I’m being 100% serious with this. Whenever I troll online (just look at this accounts post history) I find it funnier than almost anything. I can be all by myself and say a bunch of weird shit then if I get a good reaction I laugh hysterically and even when I look back at it the next day or so I will still chuckle at whatever it was.

16,"First time posting. Background here is that I (20M) have had a history of depression, anxiety, insomnia, anger issues, and substance abuse. The past three years had been the worst, so come summer 2019, I decided to take a break and actually work on myself. I’d tried “working on myself” in the traditional sense wherein I got therapy (twice with different therapists), started exercising, etc. but none of them worked and I almost always found myself back to square one. Over the summer, I did a lot of things, but I felt the deepest change after I read Crime and Punishment (great read, especially for depression). By now, I’ve completely changed my attitude. Instead of seeing the world as I think it should be, I see it for what it is. I try my hardest not to make judgements about anyone. I feel a general sense of appreciation for life and the people I meet everyday. I’ve gotten to a point where I can empathize with complete strangers on the street. I would never have been able to do any of these things before because I was so caught up in my own pain. 

Despite all this, I still feel miserable and empty. This feeling is also making me very frustrated and I’m taking this anger out on people close to me. I am worried and I just want to know if this ever ends. Am I being impatient? Should I just accept my mental state as a fact of life and do the best I can?",20Oct2019,1

19,"Hi reddit, today is another day.

I've been paraniod recently about so many things that's it been hard to focus. I managed to occupy myself for a few hours today, but then I was back to nagging thoughts of the unknown. Aliens are what's been worrying me the most, to the point every night i get anxious about looking up at the sky alone. Or worse I've started to just curl in my bed at night and huddle in a ball to block all my thoughts out.

Hearing voices is like a curse. Sometimes they are nice and help you when you're down. Other times they hurt, they ruin everything good in your life and turn it into mush. My head feels murky. I can't really stay focused on what I want without feeling worse and worse about life. About myself. I rocked today as i tried to sort out my thoughts. I feel like I'm someone watching a building slowly collapse, I'm waiting for the debri to fully crush me to death.

I want to be loved. But I'm scared of being hurt. But I'm scared of being alone. But I don't have a person who'll love me romantically as I desired. But that's my own fault. See? Round and round and round we go and it never ever stops. I could write books upon books of my inner ramblings.

The debri hasn't made it's way to my body yet. To my vital organs, to my brain, my skull, my ribcage. I'm still aware but in pain and suffering. I feel. Like I am never going to escape this cycle of rinse and repeat rinse and repeat rinse and repeat. Over and over I'll get better, fall in love then lose it all. Over and over I'll make a friend and love them like a possesion only to end up actually being the doll.

Again. It never ends. Again. It won't ever end. Again. Even after my death.",20Oct2019,1
20,"I picked up my parents from work and as I pull up, I felt anxious, I had gotten bitten by my dog yesterday and although she has all her Vaccines and I do too, I thought of the worse. I picked up my parents and asked my dad to switch seats with me, so he did. I then had my first panic major attack. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, like something was blocking my airway, then my arms and my legs stiffened up and I couldn’t move, I had so many thoughts in my head, I told my parents I was gonna die and for them to take  me to the ER. I pulled up at the ER and I couldn’t walk, I got a wheel chair and my parents wheeled me in, I waited in the waiting room, taking deep breathes and the nurses called me to check in with me, every was normal, nothing was extreme, my heart was pounding but they didn’t find anything weird or out of the ordinary. I started to feel better, I gained feeling in my arms and legs, and now here I am, in the ER, the nurses think I’m okay and if I’m being honest I think I am too.

22,"My face is numb. I can feel it when I touch it, but I don't have that fine sensitivity that lets you tell whether or not there's food on your face without reaching up and feeling for it. I think there's food on my face after every meal. Every time I start to feel better and more connected, something touches my face and it all falls away again. I'm foggy and disorganized, easily confusing one thing for another, restless and aimless and unable to focus. I mention the face numbness because it's eerily similar to the way my face felt when I had a psychotic break last year from not sleeping. The smells in my house remind me of it and so does looking at certain parts of the rooms, and the way I'm feeling now feels a lot like then, too. I'm not delusional and I'm not hallucinating anything beyond split-second corner-of-the-eye flickers so I'm definitely not *actually* psychotic, but everything feels very wrong and I can't always figure out the difference between memories of doing things and imagining having done them. My body feels warped, my sense of space is fucked. My short-term memory is almost nonexistent. I can't stop rocking back and forth. I might be in hell.

I know it's probably just a particularly uncomfortable derealization episode paired with my preexisting anxieties. I know it's probably just me psyching myself out and fixating on the bad things.

23,"I live in a block of flats ,been here for 5 years , before I moved here I took citalopram for 30 days which has caused me damage to this day , sex drive is nowhere near the same , which is  shocking after all this time, genitals are almost numb and there's no real urge or feeling horny or desire the way it was before , i can still function but the natural sex cycle that is a huge factor over our entire life behaviour etc etc is not functioning properly since taking an ssri , I barely have any romantic desires, to be in a relationship , I do but the natural way I used to feel just made things happen, before taking an ssri naturally things just happened , you found someone attractive your hormones kept you in check and you navigate on alot of natural functions that allow you to feel and connect, ssri have damaged this and it's much more difficult.

it's seriously messed up I dont feel normal anymore its like I'm not even present . ssri blunt your rewards systems and nothing feels truly as it should there is no electricity everything is dulled right down, which overtime seems to effect behaviour and thought, because nothing feels natural.

you no longer have natural guidelines to behave based on how you should feel , the signals are not working properly and it's almost as though you begin to start freaking out abit because you are so disassociated.

Your personality changes , because you no longer feel much of your self but dissociation

For a while now I have been unable to feel like I'm present and fully in the moment ,  my mind is always sort of somewhere else and I'm not even fully aware of my body .

 I also realise the level of stress I've been living with, ontop of  the damage and dissociation from the ssri is only causing more dissociation. I worry it's  been triggering some worsening mental health to.the point I am not even fully aware of the severity.

Sometimes I'm not fully aware of just what state my mental health is in. Until I'm confronted by it suicidal  and others seem to be aware of it.

One thing I seem to lose track of time sometimes , time just seems to go by so fast then slowly , the I realise it's like 3am , I dont know I'm just not present, 

I believe the environment im living in ontop of the ssri dissociation has caused a massive decline .

When I first moved here I wasn't as bad, was mentally healthier , had a good work ethic , lived healthily , went to the gym, saved money ,my outlook was alot better , and although there was some issues from the ssri use , I was present , present in my mind and in my life .

 over the last few years , I've become more and more uncomfortable, stressed , can't get peace, my place of residence had begun to create paranoia, and stress of daily life etc and the issues around taking an ssri , dissociation, I think my mind  doesn't know how to manage it 

living in flats on top of each other , I've become weirdly paranoid ,about what I do in the flat , as though I'm being watched all the time ,
Started hearing voices , not actually ,but voices in my head .
I can hear neighbours making noise and going to the bathroom, and then sometimes there is just complete and utter silence , the ceilings are low and the rooms are on the claustrophobic side , what used to not bother , had seemed to eventually create some form of mental illness in conjunction with dissociation and high stress 

I have read studies that have shown flat blocks to be bad for mental health and can trigger schizophrenia .

 I haven't been able to relax in my own place for a few years now and the mental health issues have extended to everywhere , I'm paranoid out of the house , in the car I just can't get a way from it .

I've been suicidal more than once over the past few years but have kept everything bottled up as much as possible until eventually I start to crack up.

I don't see myself as schizophrenic but I could well have some traits I can't tell whether it's schizophrenia or wether I've been living in an unhealthy environment to your mental health and with chronic stress that's eventually caused some abnormal thinking .

I've been trying to get out of here for ages but due to mental health reasons and a damaged cornea ( also part of the problem) that sustaining long-term work has become a problem,

All and all, my mind has become completely warped, I'm worried I'm becoming a schizophrenic I'm becoming barely functional, half the time I'm barely present ,and just live  

I don't know having some sort of existential crisis 

I'm definitely neurotic or paranoid , I pick up of messages that arent even there, just as an example , if I'm doing something and someone sneezes in another room , I think they can see or hear you and know what your doing,

26,"Please help me, one of my closest friends is suffering from some problems right now and I have no idea how to help them. I can’t figure out whether or not the problem is seriously concerning or if I just have to leave them alone to sort it out themselves... Some of their “symptoms”, or concerning behavior, is as follows:
1. They tend to have a lot of panic attacks at school (sometimes from bad grades or sometimes just out of the blue).
2. They claim that they don’t feel emotion after the panic attack and say that they will feel better after spending some time crying (if that makes sense?).
3. They have a very strict family and their parents tend to compare them to other people for the smallest things. Their parents are especially strict about grades (hence getting a panic attack after getting an 80% after a 10 point quiz; which really isn’t a lot at all)
4. They are very unconfident in themselves and tend to say things like “math is the only thing I’m good at” or joke about how they will live in a dumpster when they’re out of school.
5. (This one is a little questionable) They told me once that they think they may be depressed, but refuses to go seek any professional help.
I don’t know if they are just very emotional or if their mental health really needs urgent attention. I am afraid they will become more stressed (as now they have a foreign exchange partner over and no longer has privacy in their own home) and at one point they will break. I want to be there for them but when they are breaking down in front of me I just can’t find words to say. They enjoy art and math, so I try to compliment them in those aspects in order to raise their self confidence, but these events keep happening and I am increasingly more worried.

This is a desperate plea from someone who is very worried for the mental health of their friend, if you have any suggestions at all please inform me. I really don’t want this situation to escalate more than it has already. I appreciate any help I can get, but I do not wish to waste anyone’s time. Thank you for reading this...",20Oct2019,10

28,"I do well in school. I’m studying biology. I’ve been selected for honor society, I’m above average for medical school matriculates. No where near time to apply as I’m a junior. My life looks successful and great on paper, but from the inside looking out, I realized I’m a mess. 

I’ve been pushing myself insanely hard to do well to prove a point to the family I’ve never felt accepted me. From being ‘disowned’ - twice - to being completely ignored by others for days at a time. I asked my mother about majoring in mathematics and was laughed at. 

Come to think about it, I can’t think of a single piece of wisdom my family showed me. It’s all me burning myself out to feel valid, or feeling shame because I said or did something stupid without knowing better.

My family only cares about results, and they’ll try to devalue something they never helped me to get constantly. For now and on, I attend school on my own accord. No more making me feel stupid for having ambitions. No more comparing me to other people. No more “shut up and listen to your elders”. 

My family is a clown show and I’m finally ready to grow a backbone for myself and I’m suddenly ‘trying to prove that I’m an adult ’ now. They’re unable to get over the fact that I don’t give two, fat filled, floating shits what they think of me anymore. I bet if I actually became a doctor I’d be their new ATM anyway.

See my parents were foster parents at a children's home, no I don't mean I was a foster kid, I was their biological son and we all went to the same school, and the same grade, and the same church, you get the picture.  I couldn't so much as make a sneeze without my parents knowing about it, as their son, it was expected of me to put on airs in so much as to make sure that nothing is wrong, and everything is always fine even if it wasn't.  When I was 16 my grandparents died and it was my first time to deal with this issue, my medication was increased significantly (mostly Zoloft at the time), but I eventually got through it in a couple of years, while it was very sad and I did mourn in my own way I was expected to excel at school so I could go to college and get a degree.  When I graduated high school I had one last summer before college, I decided to study Computer Science with a minor in Math, I never had a real career path of what I wanted to do (more on that later) and so I figured since math and science were my best subjects I should study those.  Shortly after summer started my father was in a major car accident, and was rushed to the hospital and was in a coma for the majority of summer, we spent an entire month in the hospital in the waiting room before he woke again.  Once he was awake, his voice was hoarse all the time as if he perpetually lost his voice, however he was stable that I was confident enough to go to school.  My first time in college was a disaster, without the rigid structure and how worried I was about my father I would go to class and then immediately go to my dorm, I didn't interact with my roommate, I didn't speak to anyone, and I kept to myself the entire time (which I do now mostly anyway it does come with Asperger's, however, this was even less so).  Eventually, my father went to another hospital in November that year as he seemed to be getting better, I told him I was doing fine in school (I wasn't) and he said he was proud of me for going.  Then on Thanksgiving, he died.  And I down spiraled.  I just quit, everything, I finished out the semester with Bs and Cs and one F and I started the second semester and just gave up halfway through it, I couldn't take it anymore and I did see counseling for it but I never truly opened up, as I thought I could do everything on my own, and I don't need help from anyone.  I kind of floated around for awhile and in 2008 I decided to go back to school to try again after giving it much thought, my mother agreed and I went to school at DeVry (big mistake).  I thought I could handle the accelerated courses but I just couldn't, I thought I was smarter than I was but my grades said otherwise and whenever I found a course of study was too hard I would just change my major instead of powering through it, or just give up on it once I knew I would be able to make a C in the class.  Eventually I found the whole thing wasn't working and got out of there and obtained an Associate's in Science at a local community college.  During this time, my mother started dating again (I never dated, not even in high school, I don't know how to and let's leave it at that) and at first I felt betrayed but I knew she was unhappy just as I was and if dating and eventually marrying someone else made her happy then I was all for it, my happiness was always a secondary matter.  Once she did remarry I did have a hard time warming up to the guy, however, and I hate to say this I found that he was as much and possibly a better father than my biological one.  He did have problems with his heart though.  In 2011, I decided to go back to my original college and finally focus on something I chose accounting this time mostly because anything with science required a master's degree and I just couldn't see myself in college for another 4-6 years with the amount of debt I had already accumulated.  Not long after that my stepfather had to have heart surgery to get a pacemaker put in, he had a heart attack on the operating table and died within the week.  How could this happen, the same school and I lose two fathers in a similar fashion, again I just stopped everything in school I performed what they call an unofficial withdrawal and I had to pay back my Pell Grant.  At this point I had been off medication for quite some time, I couldn't afford to go to the doctor to get a refill and I just decided to quit taking it on my own.  I eventually moved back in with my mother where I got a job selling appliances, until I could get on my feet, that business no longer exists anymore.  My mother remarried again and I'm having a hard getting to know him, I know he's a decent person and I do generally like to be around him, but I'm afraid to get close to him, to get close to anyone anymore.  Seeing the fall of my current position, I decided to move in with my cousin on my father's side, we were always really close and the past year has been, interesting, my new job was doing well, but again the company I worked for was going under and I had to once again live on credit.  I did find a new job and I'm on its 3rd week I'm still struggling financially and I believe I will continue to do so with this job, I'm tired of commissioned sales, I'm tired of missing everything because everyone is off on the weekends, and I'm tired of this life.  Not one good thing has come of it, I don't have a degree worth having, I can't go back to school because not only am I so in debt it would be irresponsible of me to do so I still don't know what I want to do, I know what I DON'T want to do.  I can't see a doctor and haven't been in over 7 years because I cannot afford it, I can't see a therapist for the same reason as well.  I can't talk to irl people about this because I'm not close to anyone, I've never even had sex because I don't know how to talk to people outside of the pretense of selling something.  I just...don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I'm a waste, I wasted my life, I wasted my good years away there was always something telling me in the back of my mind that if I just suffer on a little more I'd make it, but I can't anymore, I just can't.

I also experienced a severe sadness for a few months; however, I don't want to call it depression because I don't really want to do self-diagnosis. Anyway, I have this friend who's been telling me that they really want to die due to family mistreatment. I don't know what to say because we're only students and I can't support them financially even if I wanted to. They've been asking me if there's any reason to live and I feel like my responses just makes things worse.

I'm pathetic, I can't live by myself and can't do anything alone. I will never be independent from my parents due to the lack of the ability to fullfill basic tasks to live. I have too much fear from the future and too little energy to fight. Paying bills, washing clothes, buying and driving a car, getting an own apartment, going to authorities, doing paper stuff... No, that's too complicated and too energy consuming to me.

I feel alone. I have a good family that understands me and a good friend, but there's just no feeling of love. I feel no affection. Those who I feel affection towards, I'll never meet, because they're online and either too far away or just don't want to meet me. My best friend is living close to me, but we only met once 2 years ago and since then she doesn't want to meet me again.

I’ve been talking to this guy since May and I’ve really become extremely attached to him. Me and him are very close friends and at one point I really felt like we were about to start dating but everything has gone to shit. He’s starting fooling around with a girl and even the thought of it gives me full blown panic attacks. Sometimes he honestly is really toxic and fake to me and ghosts me. There’s been a lot of times where I really want to just completely cut him off but the thought of not talking to him gives me the worst anxiety and panic attacks I’ve ever had and I’m just so upset and confused and all over the place and none of my friends are helping me and I’m so drained. It’s honestly making me depressed and suicidal again. 

I know for a fact he cares about me a lot and he has his own mental health problems and I think that has a very big part in it too. I honestly think if we can get past this, things can go back to how they used to be.  I just don’t know how to get unattached to him or how to stop my anxiety. I don’t want to lose him either.

36,"Hello reddit from my throw away account.

Background I have been diagnosed with PTSD and major depressive disorder.

Not on any medication. I went through several different medications and none worked except celexa for 3 months. Even then just kind of.

No insurance anymore and can't afford to go to therapy and psychiatrist wooot.

Something that has always bothered me but I never worried about until tonight is I feel like I have a shutdown of emotions.

This will sound like me bitching about my husband but I want you to know what started the feelings to no feelings

My husband has made me so angry today.
We have a fairly new baby and she is a 'high needs' baby. She requires a lot of attention. I cannot put her down when she's awake(Not enough patience to go into it all) but I only take care of her now until she is a bit older and doctors say she'll grow out of it. Anyway my husband works so on his days off I never ask him to worry about her and if he wants to play video games all day I let him.

But today brought up a mental fit of mine. He went out. I figured he was doing his usual manly hobbies.
He comes home and sleeps and I find someone to watch baby while I clean the house.

Husband wakes up for a night excursion with friends. Whatever.

When I'm cleaning I discover he has went and eaten out at our favorite restaurant. Without even mentioning it to me or bringing back my favorite foods. I get a little angry. Text him that he's a traitor. But try and laugh off his thoughtlessness. 

Then I have to go pick up baby to discover all his friends have my car blocked in. I text him that I need to pick up our daughter. He just texts back sorry he forgot. I become belligerent.

Like I scream into the woods, they'd have called the cops if I lived in a city.

I think about how he hasn't even touched our daughter today.

How I haven't showered in days because I can't leave our newborn alone.

How he went out to eat with people and didn't think of me once.

How when my job to take care of our baby has a break I have to clean the house or it wont get done
.
I'm staring at his only job, the trash, that hasnt been taken out and is in piles around the actual can.

How his only attempt to talk to me today was because he was horny.

How he ran out with friends and forgot that our daughter needed picking up.

I go from a breaking things screaming rage (I don't do that much anymore, just his boxed food doggy bag) to crying but I went through that step very quick to. To the final I feel nothing.

What bothers me is the feeling of I dont care about anyone or anything.

Got someone to bring her home.
She was in her rocker crying my basic instincts kicked in taking care of her but all feelings were gone. It's like she wasn't even my child and my husband a stranger.

I hate this and it make me so guilty.
I've felt nothing but love for my daughter and diHeldn't think this feeling nothing could apply to her. R

Crying now because I'm 'feeling' once again. I love her so much. It's just like everything shuts down for a bit. Going numb. In that span of time everything around me could disappear and I wouldn't care.

I fucking hate this more than ever.
It didn't hit me as hard before but now with my child it's scary. Not like I would hurt anyone but just the fact that you don't feel or care.

Thanks for reading and any insight or your own experience would be nice.
Baby is curled up with me resting and I've never felt more ashamed.

38,"I [24F] don't know what I am going through, but it's costing me my limited sanity. I'm in a premier league B-School and I am supposed to talk to people. After conversing with people for some one and half hours, I feel drained and after that I drift away from the conversation, unable to focus on what the other person said to me. People usually make fun out of me for this. I've been a laughing stock because of this several times and this is not for the first time. 

I feel lost in usual stuffs, I look for own peace of mind but very few places allow me to be myself. The moment I step into the city, the crowd, the noises and lights: all of it starts to bother me a lot. A lot. When I say a lot, it means energy completely sucked out of me. Fatigue comes easy. My mom used to say that I am lazy, but I'm not. If I am fixated on something, I do it no matter whatever it takes.

 I don't know what to do about it. Staying alone doesn't help either, my own thoughts get louder. I'm willing to put efforts and invest in good relationships with people, but then this thing prevents me to actively participating in interesting conversations. Somedays, that interesting part of me is shut close- No matter how badly I want to be with people, it just isn't there. 

Also, whenever I speak, my sentence structure is jumbled. Plus, I have very less attention span. I reply to any yes-no question without a simple answer. Sometimes, air conditioner triggers me and I get panick attacks. I want to date, have a social life, everything that everybody else is doing. I just want to know the ways I can help myself.

But every time I call my parents, I still try to vent out a bit in hopes of seeking comfort. And they would tell me that: “What’s wrong with you? We have worked hard to help you achieve what you want, why are you still complaining and feeling unhappy all the time? Is it not enough for you?”

I understand what they’re coming from - I can go to school and have my three meals a day, but does that mean I cannot feel unhappy because of what I’m going through? Seems that it’s always my fault.

43,"For a long list of reasons I’d rather not elaborate, I’m mentally/emotionally unstable. Since my childhood I never have been. I was extremely obese as a child and had no friends. It took me a while to find fitness, and it was the only thing that made me feel better and helped me build relationships I still have to this day. I’m now in incredible shape, but the only problem is that I am addicted to this drug so to speak called exercising. I need to workout at least once a day or else it becomes extremely difficult for me to have the mental strength to get through a day at work, or even just normal stuff with my wife like going out and planning our future. If I’m having a really bad day I’ll train twice or maybe 3 times. The problem here is that I burn myself out every week and when I do I lose the mental healing effects of exercise. Also I skip a day of exercising I basically have to stay in my house and in my room to avoid feeling emotionally unstable so it’s hard for me to plan days to recover and take off. I have what seems to me a perpetual pit of hate inside me from my childhood, that comes with a very violent lust. I have urges to violently hurt people or slam objects on a regular basis. I also have this other kind of hatred that’s more sad, and makes me want to torture and make people feel pain. I also feel worthless and useless sometimes, as though I can never find fulfillment in this life in this day and age. A good day for me is waking up and exercising before heading to work, not having any violent thoughts at work and feeling like I’m an important part of the team. I feel like an effective manager and I enjoy helping customers who have problems instead of arguing with them. Then to finish the good day off coming home to my wife and spending time with her doing anything from going on a walk, playing video games, cooking or watching a movie. I don’t enjoy going out frequently, I find interactions with other humans that are not within my very small circle to be very overwhelming and taxing. If work was a little stressful for me I’d come home and have that second workout to get my mind right. A bad day is not working out before I go to work, (or working but being burned out from working out 2-3 times a day for the past couple of days)and then having a staff member call out or not show up and scrambling to call someone else to come in while there’s also problems with customers going on at the same time that are just being plain ignorant. This is where the violent thoughts and emotions come in. I then start to question myself and my worth. I will handle some situations a little unprofessionally because I’ve had it with being too nice to people who didn’t deserve it. Then I will go home and my wife will want to go out somewhere and I won’t want to because I will want to workout and being anywhere with random people will be too much for. We will go and I will be angry the whole time and we will get into some stupid arguments. When we get home she will ask what’s wrong with me and then I’ll just have flashbacks to something of my childhood and I’ll scream and punch walls, head butt walls, throw and break any object in my way. I’m not sure what’s really wrong with me, I don’t really have the money to see a medical professional to speak to about this. I also don’t think that it would help me since I’m extremely introverted and just the thought of having to open up face to face and relive my memories with someone emotionally and mentally drains me. I’m just hoping there’s someone out there who will read this and at least be able to relate to something (not that I wish anyone to have the memories and emotions I have) and maybe give a piece of advice as to something that has helped them out.",20Oct2019,1

First things first Iv got horrible depression and bad anxiety. It runs in the family, both my mom and dad.
I sometimes feel like I’m bipolar but I haven’t been told I am. 
Anyways onto why I need help. 
My ex girlfriend is in a relationship with another guy.
I still have feelings for my ex girlfriend even though she emotionally abused me for about 2 years. 
I don’t know why I still love her. 
I’m in high school and I don’t go to regular classes. 
I have to go in the morning do all my work on a computer for 3 hours and that’s it for the day.
It’s very depressing. I want to go into regular classes and be a “normal” person but I can’t seem to do so. 
My ex basically told everyone some rumors about me. 
Some true, some not. So everyone hates me or doesn’t like me. I’m unattractive so no one ever asks me out or whatever. Now I did go to regular classes for the first day. Only the first day. 
I felt so proud of myself for getting through the day. 
Now I forget the reason why but i couldn’t make it to school the second day, and a thing with me is. 
If I miss one day, my mind says I should miss another. 
And another. And so on.
I’m a bit of a slow learner so I’m very far behind.
Sorry for the long story (I talk a lot) 

First advice.
What do I do about my ex. How do I stop myself from liking her. How do I stop myself from texting her. 
We still talk but not often. 
How do I get over her fully. 

Second advice: My education is so behind and I can’t go to regular classes. So regular old school isn’t a option. How could I get better. Mostly math. 

Third advice.
My depression is really bad. I cry a lot and I’m very emotional. Does anyone know any tips on how to stay positive and distract myself from the big sad.

This isn’t something that I’m very comfortable talking about, but I started self harming again because it’s the only way I know how to distract myself and numb the pain enough to get by. I’m ashamed and I’m still hurting so much. It hasn’t helped but I can’t stop.

I can't find it online, or it doesn't exist. I look up the definition of ""introvert"" and it just says shy person, but I'm not shy. I can go out and have fun and I like making people laugh. I'm very creative and I spend alot of effort just being THAT person. 

But it exhausts me so quickly. I burn out like a candle under a blowtorch. Like, I'd go return bottles or something for the deposit, and I'm gone for like two hours. I talk to literally anyone dumb enough to walk up to me and I make them laugh and we have fun. Then I get home, and despite the long night sleep and a shot of 5 hour energy, I pass out for 5 hours and I don't want to see literally anyone for another 5. It's like I have a little health bar and once it's depleted I have to scuttle myself away like a hermit crab and wait for my instincts to tell me when to go out again. 


It can't be introversion. I'm not shy or whatever. I spent like 10 hours at a wedding being a social butterfly moving around and enjoying myself, which is the opposite of being an introvert. I'm trying to help myself out here. Everything at this point, especially if it involves other people, makes me feel like I just woke up from a 10 year coma and my muscles have wasted away.

So.. Here goes nothing.
Hey all Im wondering about people's use of the giggle Bush to deal with depression and or anxiety. I'm dealing with major depression and social and general anxiety disorders.( and possibly a personality disorder) I've been on 5 different antidepressants, from prozac to venlafaxine. Ssri's, Ssnri's the works. I've tried everything they've thrown at me and I'm taking quetiapine at the moment for anxiety and venlafaxine 225mg for the depression but the quetiapine knocks me out cold, funny that when zopiclone didn't work. I'm at my wits end again and have turned back to the green to help me relax. I can't stay on that path forever but the mental health programmes around here in nz seem hopelessly planned. To the extent where they only took it seriously after my 2nd attempt. I'm struggling currently and my next appointment is in a few weeks. The dark thoughts are creeping back in and the mind fuck of having been with someone that's bi polar and were still best friends but not together yet we share a bed even. We've been apart for a couple months then 'slept' together last weekend and she's been shut off emotionally yet still caring since. I'm beginning to think most of its me and I'm too fucked to realise. I'm I disassociate often and zone out too. Then there's the case of wanting socialisation but not having the energy or willpower to achieve it. I just stay in bed or work on my car. Hi work between 9 and 11 hour days and am wrecked after but its mentally less stressful than my old job which I quit for that reason. I'm really running out of drive to keep trying. If you made it this far, I applaud you. My minds ticking over too fast for me to work through this all properly so it's a tad scrambled. Thanks anyways guys and gals and whoever else.

I don't see anything that's actually around me when I hallucinate in that way. I only see the scene in my mind until I snap out of it or the music stops. I can do this for hours at a time.

Also if she says someone I like looks good or says they like her my hands start shaking, my heart rate speeds up, and I feel like I’m about to vomit. In addition to this I will spend a painful amount of time at night thinking about what she said and won’t be able to sleep.

56,"16m been arrested at school, put in a psych ward, interviewed by the fbi twice, on meds for over a year, ""got help"" whatever the fuck that means. 

To anyone who has suggested to ""seek help"" or is a ""professional"" I hope you drown in a pool of shit. No one literally fucking no one cares about cares about my problems. Psychologists and other scamming pieces of shit are fucking useless. Showing up to class and taking people's money for talking to them doesn't make you a professional it makes you absolute fucking scum. I've already ""got help"" and still every single problem goes dismissed. You want me to get better? Then you don't believe anything I say? What they really meant to say was ""your feelings aren't real go fuck yourself"". Social workers are fucking joke except they're not even funny.

58," So.... To explain everything from the beginning, so you can understand, I am currently 14 years old. Two years ago, everything started, a lot of things happened to me, I lost my friends, they were saying shit about me. I started a passion for difference. Everything that was different was something I was passionate about. And I began to see mental illness as a divine or at least superior state. I was diagnosed with ""Extremely Severe Social Phobia"" and ""Extremely Severe Anxiety Disorder"" when I was 12 years old... I hadn't noticed, but I was starting to become out of touch, literally. What is affecting me right now. In short, I was 12 years old and I wanted to die, I don't remember why, but I didn't want to put in any more efforts without rewards. And you're going to think it's stupid, but the Anime (Japanese) pulled me out of it. But now I'm back down. In 2019, I still go to school because the laws force me to... and there are 2500 students, which kills me with my social phobia. And I don't have much time to enjoy the rest. And of course, I don't talk to anyone at school, which always puts me in my thoughts. I'm still addicted to mental problems. And precisely, for the past few months, I've had episodes where I'm even more paranoid (normally I'm already a lot paranoid), I have hallucinations and I want to kill (I'll never kill anyone). In short, to make the most important point, I have no, really no, empathy for anything and I feel superior, without insulting or needing attention, just if someone hates me or is afraid, I will laugh and enjoy it. I don't know why, but I like it when someone's afraid of me. Sorry if I make mistakes. (I'm already seeing a psychologist,  I already talked this with him but he don't believe me.. And I already seen 4, without nothing..)",20Oct2019,1

62,"I’m 17, have struggled with anxiety my entire life but mostly had it under control. Whenever I would have panic attacks, they’d be the typical hyperventilating, hands and legs go numb, crying type of attack. They usually lasted a few minutes at a time, I could easily be coaxed out of them and after that, they were over and I was okay. Recently my friend convinced me to smoke weed with her, I had smoked it before, didn’t have a problem with it, so I went along. She ended up letting me use her DAB pen, and I had never used one before and she didn’t give me a limit to how much I could do, so I just kept hitting it. We got to a point where we were laughing so hard that I blacked out for a moment, said “I don’t remember the last 10 minutes” and laughed about it but once I said that, something inside me switched and I had the worst panic attack of my life. 

I thought I was dead, or dying, and nothing around me felt *there*. I wasn’t myself either, I was convinced I was my mom in my own body and I kept yelling at my friend that “my daughter is dying”. My voice sounded like my mom, my hands felt like hers when they touched my face. I tried calling 911bbut my friend tackled my phone out of my hand and instead I ran up into her parents bedroom and started yelling at them that “my daughter” was dying and they needed to call an ambulance. Her mom held onto me and started asking me questions, like where I was, who I was, and eventually something inside of me just switched and I became myself again. They drove me home after that, and I switched back and forth between me and my mom for 5 hours, ended up puking everywhere and whenever I tried falling asleep I would jolt up and gasp for air like I was suffocating. My mom had to hold me that night to get me to sleep and I didn’t fully recover from that for a week, but then I was fine and felt like myself again. 

I’m a college student though, and one night 2 weeks? later I was doing my homework and read something in a discord chat that made me overthink. I’m terrified of dying, and their comment made me think about it. I sat there trying to focus on my work but suddenly I felt a tight cold feeling in my chest and I knew exactly what was happening so I ran downstairs to my parents. My step dad was sleeping and I woke him and told him that I “wasn’t myself again” and he woke my mom and I ended up clutching onto her for awhile until she finally led me to her bed and held me until I fell asleep. That night though, I only switched for a few seconds. I still didn’t feel right though so I skipped school the following day. I forced myself to go back after the day I skipped school and I ended up having that type of panic attack again, on campus, in my commons building, ironically in front of the mental health booth. I didn’t fully switch, but my brain was trying its hardest to and I was fighting like fucking hell to stay myself. My friends held me and asked me questions until my mom could pick me up and from there it was a 30 minute drive home. My head was numb, my legs, arms, chest, they were numb too. I couldn’t keep a straight thought. I put on Hamilton to comfort me and the fact that I was perfectly singing along to every word just ended up scaring me more because I over thought that I was doing it without thinking and my heart just pounded in my chest. I couldn’t talk to my mom the whole way home. I just sat and stared out the window and silently begged for her to drive a little faster because I wanted to be in bed and I wanted her to hold me until I could sleep it off.  

It’s been nearly over a week and I haven’t recovered from that attack. My bedroom is in the attic, and I have a golden retriever. He stays up there with me because we have chihuahuas. I usually walk him every day at the park, he’s my baby. But I can’t be in my room anymore. I can barely sit on the stairs leading up there and I sob every time he runs down them to see me because I can’t be with him anymore. I have to sleep in my moms bed now. I can’t be alone anymore. I had a week long break from school this week, but I go back monday and I have no fucking idea what I’m gonna do. I’ve been lightheaded, super fucking nauseous, my entire body shakes and gets feverish but I feel freezing. I can’t focus, or I end up hyperfocusing on something and I freak out because I depersonalize from everything else around me and suddenly the cold numb feeling comes back. My mom has to hold me until I fall asleep. Falling asleep was my only way to feel normal, but 3 nights ago I had a nightmare. I ended up having a panic attack, while asleep, and couldn’t wake up on my own. I had to start yelling at myself to wake up in my own dream until I did and after that I started hallucinating. I was seeing things, hearing things. And I stayed up from 4 am until my parents woke up because I was too scared to wake them and I just broke down sobbing. I kept sobbing on and off all day that day, and then every day since then. I don’t feel like myself. I can’t call my friends, my boyfriend, I can’t talk to my parents or my little sisters or see or interact with any of my animals. I stutter whenever I try speaking now, my handwriting is fucking ineligible, I’m seeing double vision. Nothing in me feels right and I’m so scared. I’m so scared of everything now. I’m scared of thinking the wrong thing, of laughing too hard because that’s what triggered the first attack. I’m scared to be alone and I don’t know what I’m going to do once school starts back up again. I had projects to do over this break and I physically couldn’t get out of bed to do any of them and when I tried I just cried. I always praised myself for being dependent, but now I rely on everyone around me because I don’t even know me anymore. I don’t know how these posts work, I don’t know if anyone will read this disaster. It’s 3 am and I’m not even sure of what I’m writing. I just know that I’m scared I’m going to forever be like this and I won’t be able to live my life without the fear of going into one of those attacks. I miss me. I miss myself. I miss walking my dog and talking to my friends and just eating food and being a fucking functioning human being. I don’t understand what smoking triggered in me, I don’t know why this is happening. I just want it to stop",20Oct2019,3
63,"I am currently 20 and studying engineering at an elite university. Since I was a small child I have always been told that I am incredibly smart. I scored a 165 on an iq test for a gifted program entrance exam in middle school. My parents told my immediate family about this and since I have been jokingly compared to Einstein. I've never let on to how much it bothers me but over the years it has developed to the point that I measure my success in comparison to irrational benchmarks(Elon musk, Jeff bezos etc.). At some point I developed a fear of failure because from my point of view, given my natural ability, there was no acceptable reason for failure. My fear of failure has been bad enough for a while now that I don't put effort into anything because I feel like if I don't try I can't fail, I don't go to classes, I don't study and I copy others homeworks whenever I can. A number I scored on a test years ago still has a significant influence on my life and how I view myself. Things come very easily to me so my level of success isn't the problem really, I have a 3.5 and am most of the way through engineering school with a top tier internship lined up for the summer. But given my outward success I have to constantly lie and say I was off studying or doing homework when in reality I was probably just daydreaming. If i tell the truth everyone gets uncomfortable and treats me different or else they do not believe me and think I am trying to brag. My life really isn't bad I just don't know what to do sometimes.",20Oct2019,2

65,"Hi all. So I'll try to be brief. I'm looking for someone to talk to anonymously.  

I have struggled with mental illness and have been hospitalized three times.  Each time I was hospitalized it was my parents who sent me there. Psychologists have worked with my parents to this extent, and I don't enjoy nor trust psychologists at all. I do not think the entire profession is a waste of time, though I do believe on occasion it provides false hope for individuals, and may become dangerous when paired with power without reason. By reason, I mean the validity of common beliefs rather than the belief that one's own perception is ultimately true.  I think that psychoanalysis has a long way to go before I would act on it in the way that it functions today.  

I have struggled with coping with the memories and lack thereof of my time in hospitals. I have struggled with maintaining a normal healthy life and I get overwhelmed by my failings to reach my own standards.  I have struggled with bullying and non-applicable solutions (toughen up, just don't be a loser) for a long time to the point where my name feels triggering.  Where I find solace is in philosophy, and research, but even this is now faltering to Netflix binges and ""youtube"" sprees, where the self gratifaction feels just too easy to pass up for time better spent.  

Full disclosure. I have struggled (nothing crazy but lasting effects) with drugs in the past and some of the repercussions still haunt me. I am surrounded by people who support me, yet I am constantly feeling lonely.  I have struggled with epistemic and existential questions that led me to stop eating and drinking.  I have and do hallucinate and deeply struggle with concepts of love. I have very lucid dreams that feel very real at moments later on in time.  I am defensive, I recognize this I do not know how to change this. 

These problems have affected me, yet I have persisted as a functional member (I hope) of my community. It feels as if I am in church without believing in what I am there for.  I want to care, but I feel like the empathy that I once had and my faith in humanity are dissipating.  Please reach out to me, I would love to talk, if for anything just to talk. I am also interested in the theory of psychoanalysis too and would love to contribute to the conversation.",20Oct2019,2

I tried therapy in the past, medication too (zoloft primarely), but mostly it did more harm than good.

I just can't open up on the therapy, so I most of the time lie that I feel better than i really do. I just can't force myself to tell others how I feel and why I feel like i do.

Me not being able to open to physiatrist or therapy led to different diagnosis -bipolar moodswings, bipolar disorded, depression. Each doctor came with different one, though i dont blame them.

Work is taxing, sooo much taxing on me in terms of stress, but If i quit I know I won't force myself for some time to look for new one - happened twice with colleage and I can't really afford that.

About 3 weeks ago I was prescribed Quetiapine. I'm on 100mg day. Very soon after I noticed that the front third of my tongue felt sore, looked red and spicy food hurt. I initially though it might be an infection (not that my tongue has been anywhere) but this persists.

And spicy food now hurts. It's not just hot, it's actual pain and that pain is prolonged. Milk is not helping, ice cream is not helping, even ice cubes barely help.

 (I wrote most of this out and accidentally deleted it so I'm a bit annoyed lol)

Basically, I have Psychosis. It's not Officially diagnosed, but I know the symptoms. I piss the bed every once-in-a-while and have absolutely no control, I have a dream about putting away the groceries and remember it incorrectly to think that there actually is new food in the fridge, I'll dream up an entire day of school and get ready for the next one, on a Saturday, ect. ect. I've trained myself to wake up to specific sounds (and eventually, specific light levels and times) or else I might sleep for ~13 hours at a time and run the risk of tricking myself that Wednesday had already past.

And then, I feel like I'm kind of dependent on minor sounds. White Noise, if you will. I always have my Fans on or a game console/pc running. Or a light buzzing. Or, just the ambient outside noise. I could even be satisfied by the breaths of strangers at the library. (Wow, you're still reading? Thank you so much for listening to me! This message was added after I finished, ofcourse.) But, this one time last week, something strange happened... the power went out on the middle of the day. Weird. All of my little sounds around me turned off, and...

IT WAS SO. FUCKING. LOUD.

My head just started to pound and pulse, it felt like my eardrums were replaced with Bagpipes. I knew there was no noise, but my head was just... it was weird. It was loud. And it lasted about ~3 minutes.

74,"Need help

I need someone to talk to. I 32(f) feel like I am ruining my relationship with my fear of inadequacy. I’ve been with my boyfriend 28(m) for two years and it’s been a hard road for the last few months due to career changes on both ends. I am a person who needs a lot of validation and affection. We work opposite schedules. When I wake up he’s coming home from work. We don’t have days off together and we are making less money to make more later on. It’s hard. I feel like we are supposed to be together in my heart.  I don’t know how to manage my stress and end up being moody and emotional. I try to get the attention I need by end up pushing him away by being too needy. I made an appointment to talk to a counselor next week. 
I don’t have a relationship with my dad. He’s a big time drug user. He is a smart charismatic man who is awful to women and has never been in my life. He has made no effort to be a father. My mother is not much better, she doesn’t do drugs but she’s unsupportive and critical. 
I feel like a failure. Like I can’t get anyone to love me.
My boyfriend can be aloof and dismissive. He is dealing with completely changing his life to be a better man and has done everything right in that aspect. He went from a dead end job to becoming a firefighter. He was an addict and now does zero drugs and zero activities that are negative. He deals with stress but avoiding and space. I get panicked a deal with things by talking and working through things right when they arise. We have very different ways of managing stress. I have been so upset lately. 
I quit a job because it was negative and unfulfilling but it was steady and consistent and now am in school to become an esthetician, I work 2 crappy jobs and my schedule is hard to say the least. 
I feel like I start fights because I’m moody and afraid. I guess even if we are fighting I am getting attention. I feel like crumbling. 
I have a daughter who I adore and who adores my boyfriend and he is good to her. I feel like I am being unappreciative off his life changes. I feel like me arguing over petty things is ruining my life. I sometimes wonder if my birth control is a factor. I feel less in control of my emotions and it’s wearing me down. 
My boyfriend keeps telling me that it’s hard right not but it will get better but I am concerned with the moment and how we don’t spend time together. We have argued every day for a week and I hate it. I know I’m not completely wrong but I know I’m a part of the problem. 
I guess mostly I just wish I knew how to deal l with my fears. I feel alone and like a failure at life. I wish I had a family to lean on but I feel like I can only lean on myself. I feel like I’m not worth the time for anyone. I feel like a whiny bitch. Like I need to just grow up and deal. It’s hard not having a support system.

The thing is, this lasting symptom that I have with my sleep has kept me looking like a fucking zombie for the past couple of years. Without the massive dark circles around my eyes, I'd be fairly average looking. I hate it. It's nearing drug-addict-ness at this point. I hate it.

What can I do to get better sleep? I don't have trouble falling asleep, it's just that I have a very hard time deciding to go to bed when I should, and not staying up as late as possible (until I uncontrollably pass out, we're talking 3-7 hours a night for 2.5 years).

I don’t cry a lot, probably bc I’m always with my roommates in college and I never cry in front of anyone/I try really hard to suppress my feelings so I don’t have to cry.

Lately, I’ve noticed that my memory has worsened and I don’t know if it’s just the lack of sleep or if i’m just stressed, but I may not remember things my friends told me like 20 minutes ago. I feel horrible because they’d have to repeat the thing they said and it’s become such a common occurrence that I can see the “did she even listen the first time?” look in their eyes. I don’t remember anything from middle school besides these two incidents where I was bullied. High school memories are becoming fuzzy.

I know memory loss can happen due to depression but I only found out yesterday that it can also affect speech. I’m fluent in english and cantonese (native tongue), and am currently learning mandarin and korean. I can’t tell if the exposure to four different languages all at once is making my thoughts become unorganized but I would find myself forgetting certain words in canto and I would even mix some words up in english.

for example, i was talking about hokkaido melons to my friends but instead of melons, i said “hokkaido lemons.” another situation was where I told someone “you’re an amazing drawer” (which is dumb i know) when i meant to say “you’re an amazing artist” but my brain was only stuck on the word “drawing.”

i feel like i’m glitching bc i get words mixed up. i would say something but falter mid sentence and try to continue the talk of the subject by interjecting a completely new sentence. i don’t really think when i speak, or rather, i feel like i’m not in the moment, which makes me feel like i’m speaking just to speak, and not to actually have a conversation with someone. I can’t really formulate verbal, coherent sentences without feeling like a nervous wreck and it’s driving me crazy.

has anyone else experience this or know what i’m talking about? i’m not sure what to do and how to feel about this.",20Oct2019,1

Hi, this is the first time I’m posting on reddit and using a throwaway account. Basically I’m needing a little advice/ support on how to continue from here. 

I finally started seeing a psychologist a few months ago and we’ve had 5 sessions prior to this one. Things were going alright before this and we were working on recognising my distorted thoughts. When I saw her yesterday, I started to share about a recent event that had made me feel upset. She asked if I had utilised a technique we had discussed early on. Honestly it had not even occurred to me to use that, I’m not sure why. She appeared to get upset and started saying that she was questioning my commitment to this. The rest of the session was basically horrible. She mentioned several times that she questioned my motivation and was seeing a lack of willingness to engage in this area. 

I’m not sure how to feel about this. I do agree that I need to do be applying the techniques more consistently in order to see change. However on the other hand, it made me very upset as I have been trying and making some behavioural changes that we talked about and also thought I had been making some progress. She has also not mentioned this before. I shared the event hoping to work through it together in the session. During the rest of the session, she asked me other questions and appeared to get upset/ irritated when I couldn’t respond. I ended up making up some things to answer for the sake of answering. 

I’m unsure how to proceed from here. I feel sad that this happened as it was going alright before. The way she reacted has taken me aback, I’m not sure if I’m comfortable with her and feel like it has maybe destroyed some of the rapport we had. This is my first time going to therapy so I’m not sure if this is normal and I should continue seeing her. I don’t want to be defensive and limit the help I could be getting. 

Any thoughts/ advice would be much appreciated, thank you.",20Oct2019,2
82,"I’m M 33. It’s been a really hard year. From the beginning of the year me and my SO had a huge fallout so we weren’t together. It stemmed from the fact she has a disability and is getting more unwell. She became so demanding before the start of the year and was very rude. I know it sounds simple but trust me, when you give everything you can for someone and it feels like you are being taken for granted, it can drain you completely.

Also to add onto this I was expected to be there ALL the time. We have a daughter and I found myself having no social life, working full time, having to give up career progression as I couldn’t work more due to helping at home... We both work in the same building, just different departments. I never stopped her going out or having breaks from keeping the house a home (waking up early to do routine with little one, looking after pets, keeping house straight etc.) but when I’d say I wanted to see someone or my family was coming she got very upset and something always came up to make me miss it.

Anyways about February we sat and talked. She realised she was taking a lot for granted and it got a lot better. I had a lot of pressure taken off me. However she fell pregnant a little while after this. Unexpected as she was on contraception which normally all went well. Due to a change in her medication it failed. Because of her illness we had to decide what to do, if she carried it she could potentially die. However she felt that she couldn’t terminate it. I agreed, life gives us these challenges and as much as I couldn’t believe it I was both scared as to what could happen and made up.

Towards the end of spring the pregnancy took a huge toll on her health and she needed a lot more medication and specialists to help her. My birthday was coming up in the summer and we figured as I’m 33 this year, we would treat our daughter. That was the best thing on my birthday, we took her to a theme park for toddlers and she had the best day. During this time I received a phone call from my doctor after explaining about a pain in my testicle.

When I got home we went for a consultation and I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly both of us had illnesses. We have a family on the way too. I started to think more about our children and the possibility of them being orphaned. The doctors were very quick to act with me, giving me an operation within 3 weeks. After the op I had to relax at home. Not an easy feat with child and disabled SO. However help from family came in here and it was much appreciated. 

It was at this point the in-laws explained that I have had my fix now and focus needed to be back on SO. Little to no compassion about what was going thru my head or relax time again. Just straight back into caring. I received results back and they caught it at stage 1. Next step was chemo, to make sure everything had gone from me. Again in-laws happy with the news asked me when I was going back to work as finances were tough and we had no savings after having to use them and pretty much using income to scrape to the next month.

SO became a lot worse and had to spend time in another hospital during the end of summertime. Thankfully a specialist managed to diagnose her the right answer and she has been stable since. We were pushing thru it all, I didn’t focus on myself as we had our goal in mind.

Next cane my chemo, I wasn’t prepared. I thought after pushing thru everything else it would be just a quick blast then carry on. I have never felt so designed in my life. Constantly feeling like am hungover or on a massive comedown. Some days are fine next it’s back. During this time I was still expected to drive family about and carry on as normal. I explained to SO and in-laws about this. I had no compassion back, just “how do you think IM feeling?” The more I talked to others about it, SO would constantly query who I was talking to and why I couldn’t just talk to her. When I did she shut me down just as quickly as before. 

A week ago I lost it again, feeling like I did at the beginning of the year. I explained I cannot continue like this, always giving and being told who I can and can’t talk to. Offering her help from my family to be denied as she only trusts hers. I kept getting angry with our daughter over little things. I felt awful and took her out to places to keep her happy. SO was not helping at home anymore as she was getting worse again. 

The day after I explained to her she felt no movement from baby. I dropped all issues and we went to the hospital. She was only just past 30 weeks pregnant but they said after two days in they need to deliver baby. He made it all well, SO was in good shape despite all being against it. I was happy. As he is premature he is currently in an incubator. He struggled initially but is fighting thru. Our daughter has met him and speaks lovingly and fondly to him. 

I have to keep showing a happy face to everyone. But am so overwhelmed. SO needs care while she is in the hospital with him. I am staying there too but again I’ve lost all social life. I’m still going but feeling myself burning out completely. I want to give everyone all I can give but I’m so tired in my head and body. 

Slowly but surely the thoughts of if I had terminal illness I would not have to deal with all the stress it’s brought us. I’d have an expiry date to know when I can finally clock off. I’m still now getting hounded to go back to work to get money at the right level for us. I can’t do it. I currently can’t get time alone to just stop and assess what has happened. I still don’t realise am parent to two children now. I can’t see what makes me happy right now and I don’t know what to do next.

I have written this down. There are a lot more things that should have been said in here to get the full picture, but this is all my head can think right now. I want to read this myself in order to assess things. I know am strong to not let stuff get to me a lot of the time, sometimes just reading your own thoughts helps. If you have read this then thank you. I have written this selfishly as I have not looked after myself for a while so please don’t judge too harshly with things.

I hope you have a good day otherwise reader x",20Oct2019,1

Can anyone relate or am I just truely fucked.",20Oct2019,1
84,"So... I wrote here once I think. It was about my life story. Things have gotten really fucked up lately though.

I’m 15. I won’t say that I suffer from anything because I haven’t gotten any diagnosis from my new psychologist yet. The last one diagnosed me with depression but he also told me that I didn’t do good enough and that he couldn’t work with me. That didn’t help a lot so I changed to another one.

I guess my main problems are that I don’t see a way to live normally anymore. I haven’t felt happy for three years now and resulted to self harm. Once I went to far with it and now my mother tells me she will take away my cat (my biggest emotional support right now) if I do it again. But I can’t bear it anymore. I have to do it again or I’ll go crazy. 

I want to kill myself but at the same time my mother is someone who can easily kill herself when facing a heavy shock and I don’t want her doing that because of me. Suicide has been my little helper since I was nine. I thought it was a nice thing then though. I told myself I would kill myself as soon as my mother died because otherwise I wouldn’t be able to stand the shock. I always get extremely connected to people I like and find it unbearable when they leave me. But I always think they are leaving me and that they hate me and I am afraid of that. At the same time I can’t even comprehend how someone could like someone like me. I can’t look at myself in the mirror because I feel disgusting all the time. Because of that I am distancing myself from all people.

The third problem are drugs and hallucinations.
Let’s do hallucinations first. I see shadows in the corners of my eyes when I’m tired. And I’m tired really often as I can’t fall asleep before 2 am and I am a sleepwalker. But lately they seem to be following me around all the time. A month ago when I thought I was feeling a bit less tense i even thought I heard someone screaming and glass shattering or music playing when the tap was on to the point that I couldn’t distinguish real music to the music I thought I heard (only that “my music” was like real music but after a while it started to get faster and faster which isn’t very realistic). 
I started smoking a while ago to ease feelings of intense fear or panic but the the real drugs I took (mainly a few months ago) were benzodiazepines because they used to take all the pain away that I feel. I had a horrortrip with a hallucinogenic drug once and got caught by my parents. 
Right now I’m smoking weed and planning to take LSD or 2cb. I might go crazy when I take any of it but at least I will have all the more reason to kill myself then.

Even now I can’t take it anymore. This whole world or at least the side of it I get to see is disgusting. I am an awful and ugly person and I just can’t live with myself. Even smoking weed doesn’t let me forget everything it just makes me lose my mind even more. This whole text probably doesn’t make any sense, right? I feel like I am really annoying everyone by posting this here or maybe my problems aren’t even that special. Wow I don’t even know what I wrote in this post and what I didn’t. I just forgot why I’m even writing this. I should probably just kill myself now.",20Oct2019,2
85,"I (20 F) have had positive things going on this year but I feel that the negatives are overpowering. 

I got engaged this year, got another dog, and graduated college. 

But, I couldn't find a job in my field, it took me several months to find a simple retail job, my previous job at Starbucks wouldn't take me back because workers didn't like me apparently. Etc. 

I mainly feel so heavy with the fact that I have no friends to interact with, and I'm too awkward and introverted to do anything about it. I have old friends blocking me on social media for reasons I don't know. I feel that I saw myself in a positive way and I was a good worker/friend but it just seems to me that it's the opposite and I'm actually terrible.

I downloaded a Gay dating app and start looking for a partner I register my self there to be Bottom and I get a lot of ppl speaking to me thro the app. and I was getting close too close to meet up But then I block the person trying to connect with me. and what stope me because I am frightened to Meet Up. The idea that I am chatting with my wife and what I believe my self, that I do not need this. what well happened if I get disses or the guy that I meet will abuse me. 

I pushed this feeling off after that night. But the same thing happens must night. I wake up looking for gay intimacy. At this point, I do not know what to do I have never been gay in my life with anyone why this feeling coming up like this. if it is the frustration it is now gone.

( On weekends I sleep about 14 hours a day, on weekdays I try to expand it to 9 hours instead of 8, but it doesn't work) I'm a university student and a lot of times when I try to study I just sit over my books and try to concentrate, which is pretty difficult with this condition, and the results are far from my peak performances, but a there are numerous occasions when I just can't read a single sentence and remember it later, because it feels like my brain is totally exhausted.

So the problem here is that I’m scared to have fun and also to meet people because I’ve been hurt quite a few times in my life and I taught myself to just learn and enjoy to be alone and not have fun with others so that I can’t get disappointed when I get home and feel alone again. When I end up having fun, I’ll be more sad than usual when I get home because then I am aware of what I missing. But when I just decide to not go out and meet people and potentially have “fun”, then I wont really know what I’m missing + I can’t get hurt/disappointed more than I already am.. so it feels like the wiser and safer thing to do.

So I'm 21 and I'm not the person I used to be.  I've gone from an A and B student to a C and B student and I'm having mood swings.  Sometimes they last several days, sometimes my mood can change in a day.  

So a lot of times, I feel like crying or I feel sad, tired, guilty, worthless, etc.  I especially feel this way when I think about what's happened in the past few years, (e.g.. My dad leaving and my parents splitting up, financial difficulties that got better but lasted for a few years, e.t.c) then other days I feel different.  I wouldn't say better necessarily but I feel like i have more energy than I know what to do with, my brain won't shut up, (I almost can't understand the thoughts I'm having sometimes), I get super horny (sorry if that's TMI) and I can't sit still, I'm either anxious, irritable, or silly, but sometimes I have better focus so despite the silly or irritable mood, I get things done. 

 Sometimes I feel irritable but without the need to rush around and do stuff.  I just feel irritable along with wanting to cry and all that stuff.  I don't spend all day in bed but I'm not always productive either.  

I'm just concerned because like today, I woke up actually feeling kind of normal, but then before dinner, my mood just shifted into an irritable mood, I have no idea why and I snapped at my mom and it's been on my mind the whole evening and I feel awful for it.

I'm missing doses and I feel awful. This has happened again and again. It's going to keep happening. It's so frustrating. Have you ever had a psychiatrist like that? I think I should switch to someone else. Whenever I call my pharmacy, they act like it's my fault. They have no sympathy at all and don't understand that if you take these kinds of psychiatric meds and miss a dose, you feel like absolute garbage. 

Why put someone on meds that give you bad symptoms when you stop taking them if you're not even going to be consistent with authorizing refills?

This is adding more stress and negative symptoms to my life. I thought psychiatric meds were intended to help, not harm. But this whole situation is leaving me worse off than the time before I ever started taking these stupid pills.

At this point I almost feel like I should just deal with the withdrawal symptoms for a while and then stop taking meds altogether, permanently, because I can't keep dealing with this stupid refill issue which comes up over and over again.

Hi everyone, I’m looking for honest and constructive advice on how to proceed with what’s happening.

I currently live with my mom (63) and sister (30) Jane in an apartment. I have 5 siblings in total and there’s a lot of toxic ness between all of us, especially as the youngest sibling who escaped living in our home country, poverty and abuse. In general I’ve been so much more fortunate than my siblings, which is why they resent me. My parents have been divorced since I was 4. This post isn’t about my family feud. It’s about how to move forward with everyone’s best interests, particularly my mom, Jane,  Maria (37), and I.

I haven’t spoken to Maria since I was 16. The last time we ever spoke was when she had a meltdown and grabbed me by the hair in the kitchen, lambasting me while threatening to get my bf at them time arrested (he was 4 years older than me). “You think you’re so smart, and innocent, that’s what you to pretend to be....I’m going to expose your lies.” I vividly remember her trying to drag me by the arm into our room. My mom woke up from her nap to hear yelling in the kitchen. She immediately got in between us and separated us. Maria spilled my beans that I was dating a college student. Horrified and confused, I ran out the apartment and didn’t come back for an hour. I came back and felt tension. My mom was shocked by Maria’s behavior and wanted me to tell her the truth— which she was receptive to. Maria lived with us for a solid 5 months without saying a word. She worked nights at bar and was essentially a bat for the duration. She would simply walk past us like a ghost. Prior to the fight, Maria and I shared a bedroom. After the fight, i had to take my stuff out when she wasn’t home. So she simply left one day without a word, leaving behind a lot of shit. She moved in with boyfriend who had just inherited an apartment from a deceased aunt.


The process of cleaning the room was reveling. She hoarded a lot of strange crap, like seven gallon ziplock bags of used and dried up makeup, food wrappers, papers, just lots of garbage. Digging through the desk, I found several bottles of empty prescription painkillers with other people’s names. I knew she smoked pot, vaped, and drank but I didn’t know she did more. It really helped me understand why she had crazy mood swings, was dissociative, and unpredictable. 

Maria had a rough childhood. Imagine growing up in a country where you were devalued not only as a female and being fostered by abusive relatives using you to extract money from your parents sending money back ‘home’. She disclosed to my brother that she was also molested or raped by a relative. Furthermore when you came to America as an adult you were unloved by your father.

As a kid, Maria treated me well and I felt her love. She would sometimes pick me up from 1st grade. She started to disappear when I was in 3rd grade and didn’t re-emerge in my life until I was a hs freshman. She treated me very differently, she was unpredictable. Sometimes she would joke around and other times yell and berate me. She was very divisive, spreading rumors about me to my brothers. They would criticize me in every way from makeup, dressing up, and even dismissing my extra curricular activities being involved with student government and debate as a hoax. I first got drunk late sophomore year, off of a bottle of vodka that she bought me. I found out later she snitched on me to my family. Anyway I’m very traumatized by Maria. 


When she left, I entered an experimental phase with drugs. It helped me understand some her strange behavior that I was ignorant of before. I was depressed throughout high school and used drugs an escape from my traumas. Today I’m in a very good place mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically. I’ve recovered and been sober for 2 years. I’m close to graduating college. I have grown to love myself and others. I’m excited about the the future. 

This summer, I found out through relatives that Maria’s boyfriend broke up with her and now shes homeless, she’s being sued for $7,000  and her husband that she’s been separated from since 2012 filled for divorce. Shes called my brothers to confide in them that she’s suicidal. She has kept in touch with people in the family except for me and my mom. She texts Jane occasionally and pours out her love for her in text but flakes whenever they make a plans to hang out. Jane is mentally handicapped and vulnerable. Jane is also afraid of Maria bc she is aware of her unstable behavior.

Today i woke up at 1am to hear knocking and ringing at our door. “Jane let me in” she continues this for 10 minutes. I go to janes room and we hide in the bathroom calling our mom at work. My mom picks up and calls Maria to leave and come back the next day when she’s home. Maria claims she’s there to pick up the mail and is angry that we won’t open the door.


My dilemma is what is going to happen now? Now she’s showing up to get her mail, but what if next week she is trying to live with us? Is she safe to be around? Although i feel bad for her, I don’t trust her. Last week my mom expressed that if Maria was willing to change, then she would help out and let her live with us. I told my mom there’s no way I’d allow that. Maria is chaos,  I can’t imagine her being physically near me. Home is a safe place and Maria would disrupt that security. Maria is also a compulsive liar, I suspect she has a personality disorder.

I don’t know what to do, what to say, how to react. I’m just trying to protect my mom, Jane and I. We worked so hard to heal from the trauma. I sound selfish, but It’s out of preservation. I’m scared of having to deal with chaos again.  I don’t think family counseling is viable. I want to know what are some ways to gradually approach the matter. 

TLDR; Estranged sister pulled up to my apartment at 1am. Didn’t open the door, told her to come back during the day when my mom is present. Genuinely afraid of her, what she she’s capable of and the chaos that will ensue if we let her back into our lives. At the same time, concerned for her life.

Update: 3:08pm she’s ringing on the doorbell again. Honestly I’m not gonna call the cops on her and I’m not opening the door.

Maria texted my mom she is gonna take legal action for mail fraud and invasion. My mom told her around 1:40am via Facebook messenger that she can come during the day to pick it up.

10am I left Maria’s mail downstairs with the doorman. Told the doorman to put in the system Maria cannot come upstairs with our consent.",20Oct2019,2

105,"Hello all, 

Lately I have been feeling isolated in social situations and losing interest in everything for no reason. I thought I was quite happy with my life but suddenly the hobbies I used to love start to bore me and, for example, I have always been such an enthusiast about almost everything and now I feel down, like with no energy to do so anymore. I went to a friend’s wedding last night and even though I was with my boyfriend and surrounded by people I love I didn’t feel like talking to anyone or getting interested in knowing new people even though I was looking forward to that wedding the days earlier and wore and very nice dress for the ocassion. Even my boyfriend said I looked cold and arrogant and I got mad at him for seeing me that way because it didn’t feel like that for me. I was just feeling blocked and sort of isolated for no reason. And it isn’t the first time it has happened to me. I had the same situation two months ago in a very similar environment. 

For example, I have always loved traveling and found joy in arranging everything beforehand but now the thought of getting inside a plane bores me and doesn’t even make me happy. I find myself wanting to be more at home doing nothing. 

As I said earlier, I have been very lively and extroverted for the past years. I am currently starting my 30s and life is looking good and settled down, but my teenage years and the beginning of my adult years were lonely and depressive and I didn’t have friends at all. I got over it but I am scared I am slowly going back to a depressed and blocked mind, or maybe too bored of being settled down. 

Any ideas of what might be happening to me and how I can feel better and happier again? 

Thank you!",20Oct2019,2

I have no idea who I am anymore other than a mess of emotions - but only the bad ones. 
I’m so scared. All of the time. I’m scared I’m actually a sociopath because I’m either void of all emotion or totally full of it and it spills out and drowns everyone around me. I’ve lost all of my friends but I have lots of acquaintances. I work with the public and get sexually harassed a lot. I don’t know how to take it. I don’t know how to act in any social setting, I just guess or copy. I really don’t know who I am. If I was asked to describe myself I couldn’t tell you anything other than my experiences in life or my “symptoms”. 
I really think this is all a game and I’m an experiment or a simulation, I get signs all the time from music or the tv or just people, eg I’ll leave the house and go to play music through my phone and my mind will shout “IF ITS A SAD SONG YOU’RE A BAD PERSON” and it will be a sad song. “IF THIS PERSON LOOKS AT YOU WEIRD SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU” and they will. I don’t know if I’m psychic. The dr will say it’s a symptom but it’s all too perfect and makes too much sense. 
I have this overwhelming KNOWING that I’m not meant to be on this planet, like when you’re trespassing somewhere or looking around someone’s house and you know you shouldn’t be, that’s how I feel about existing.

This affects me negatively because I have a really hard time connecting with new people because I suspect they feel I am ""insincere"" in most of my communications.

122,"A few days ago I was on the phone with my friend. We were on a long rant about just how my mind works, he likes to try to help me figure things out. Though we tend to go in circles. 

Anyways, I never really thought about it in depth before but we uncovered that I was sexually assaulted at least 3 times. 

There were three times, that I can remember, well sort of remember (my memory is shit). 

We were wondering if this could be the cause of my issues with sex. My breakdowns during and after. But I still do not think so it does not feel like it is the cause. Mainly because even after I found out that these things that happened to me were sexual assault I still did not have any feelings toward these events. I am not upset about them, they do not hurt me, they do not instill any emotion besides a bit of anger because the fact that those people would do that to me. But at the time that these things happened I just let it.   
I basically just went with it, blank mind and all. I just didnt care. But these things were years ago, like 5 plus years. 

Why is it that I just do not care about things that most people would probably find difficult? 

Could this be a reason some how for my breakdowns during and after sex? Even though I have never had these memories in my mind during those breakdowns? 

I honestly really do not feel like it is but my bf wants to think that it is. But I think he just wants some answer. When honestly I think it might just be that I just feel like a sack, a play toy. I have no connection to sex being a good thing. I always used it as a way to get people to like me. I felt... well still feel like if I do not give them sex early on that the whole relationship is just built around that. The way they act, speak, their mannerisms are all conformed around the want to have sex with this person (me). So I just have the mind set that if I just give it to them I will find out if they actually like me for me and not just hanging around to get sex. I do not think that I will ever think differently. I have thought this way for over 10 years.

125,"So long story short, after a particularly rough patch with anxiety and depression, I was put on Cipralex (Escitalopram). I think it's helped, as I feel a little more stable. But unfortunately, i've been starting to notice some sexual side effects. It's been about 2 years since being put on the meds, and it's only starting to manifest itself now.

I basically dont get as horny as I used to. The only thing which helps is marijuana (I live in Canada so it's legal). If I haven't consumed any, my libido is basically at 0. I'm starting to feel reliant on cannabis, but going without means zero sex drive. I also have a hard time (pun definitely intended) getting and maintaining an erection. I feel like even mid masturbation, im still like half-hard. And lastly, when I have an orgasm, it's always kind of....meh. Kind of lackluster. My orgasms before were mind blowing, now they're just...boring. 

I've heard of people switching to Wellbutrin, but i've heard that it can cause anxiety, which is a big no-go for me, as anxiety is the main reason for being medicated. 

What are my options? Please, no comments about stopping with the marijuana. I know it's probably not the best way to self-medicate, but it's all I have now. I also use it to maintain a normal appetite, as my appetite sober is very low as well.",20Oct2019,1

My brother is in the middle of a crisis and I'm not sure what I can do to help. His story is complicated but I'll try to summarize: 

He is 40, currently living in Florida with two children (11 and 9 years old) who lived with him until last week. He has struggled with addiction his whole life. As a result, he doesn't hold down jobs and finds himself in toxic relationships. He's been on and off a spectrum of drugs (painkillers, heroine, and meth) for the last 25 years. He's been in and out of methadone clinics for the last 12 years. 

He has recently relapsed; he was evicted a few weeks ago and has been living out of his car. His daughters have been staying with the old neighbor. The neighbor reported several incidents of abuse and molestation of these girls (by my brother and his girlfriend) to the police, but nothing has really happened with it. Over the last day or two, my brother has been making serious threats directed at his old neighbors, his old roommates, his girlfriend, and his daughters.

My mother has been keeping me informed, but I spoke with my brother this morning for the first time in months. He is panicking, angry, lashing out at everyone, and he is extremely desperate. I believe he is dangerous. 

My family doesn't know how to handle this. The police aren't really helping, and he is not cooperating with DCF (or anyone really). In the last two months, he's been hospitalized for severe stomach pain, swelling of the feet and ankles, and a terrible laceration on his wrist (we suspect it was self-inflicted).

My parents, mostly my mom used to be mentally and physically abusive, doing to me what you’d do to someone if you wanted to break them down and just attack when your not happy. I still deal with self confidence issues, weight issues and a tendency to self hard and self sabotage. 
I try hard but I know I’m selfish, I know I put my needs first as no one else was going to, at least that’s a core belief even if my wife proves it wrong. I have tired to stop and be less guarded but I’m always waiting for the 2nd shoe to drop, the sky to fall or her just having enough. 
I used to talk to girls online, the attention, the newness of it and the fact that some part of me was still able to attract people used to boost my mood. 
When we got married, I said no more. 3 years ago I snapped and had the whole 6 months off, drugged up the the eyeballs just to function, not feeling anything and all intimacy died. We have sex about once a month (thank god for viagra) but I don’t really feel the need for it, and could probably go without for months. 

It keeps coming unto my head, get the ego boost, get the attention you want, and it might restart the flame I had before. Or it could be the spark that blows my marriage apart.

This sentence hit me hard, I still remember this moment year after.

Teenager me was weird, I was in research of a personality and I started to explore my sexuality.
I figured out years later I was transgender and different from every body else. However my lack of social skills and quest of my sexuality bring me to some dangerous people and I got sexually assaulted. I the suffered from depression during high school and barely made it.

Young adult me started to figure things out, like affirming my gender and coming out to my friends and family, I lost a lot of people during that process, I got insults coming at me everyday, some people threaten me, people are encouraging me to commit suicide, at this point in time I started suffering from major panic attack where my body get paralysed completely (my muscles where contracting with me controlling them anymore)

Then last year the remembrance of my trauma (sexual assault) came back to me. I was lost, alone and ashamed to talk about that to anyone, I tried to commit suicide but failed, I was sent to hospital, doctors said I was suffering from PTSD. 

Now I am broken, living most of my life alone with few friends with me I feel like I am an empty shell without a personality, I am waking up in the morning, doing nothing productive.

137,"So lately I’ve been feeling like my job is a dead end(there is no advancement potential).  

I have one actual friend, but after a few questionable comments regarding my recent sobriety, I’m even questioning that rather lengthy friendship.  

I recently went on a cruise and met what I’d consider the girl of my dreams on the first night.  We spent a lot of time together, and things did get romantic.  
She has it all- intelligence, beauty, personality, care for me...but she lives on the other side of the country.  
On the last night of the cruise, after being intimate, she admitted having feelings for me, but that her heart was with another guy.  
This really sent me into a mental spin and we ended up discussing a lot of dark mental stuff going on with me.   
I have been going solo on cruises despite having social anxiety, just as a way to be happy- something for me to continue working towards at my dead end terrible job.  I really had a problem with my drinking, and I’d use the open bar on the ship as a way to drink- and overcome my social anxiety.  

We spent the last morning together, and I had a pretty rough time saying “see you soon” when it was time for me to head to the airport.  I felt like a part of my heart was leaving me.  
How I fell so quickly for a girl is beyond me.  It’s not typical of me.  She broke down an inner wall and got inside me mentally, and I was comfortable with that.   

The last 3 weeks have been pretty much us texting throughout the day, and calling a few times.  I’m so much happier when I talk to her.   

We both have committed to sobriety- even reading a book “together”.   She’s really a big reason I haven’t given in to cravings.  

She mentioned only being friends “for now”, which I was okay with.  But over the past few weeks, I’ve only grown more fond of her, and have really fallen for her hard.  I’ve tried keeping my feelings for her at bay, but it’s incredibly tough to suppress my true feelings.  
We even agreed on me coming out over thanksgiving- something I have been super excited for.  Booked a non refundable flight, and a hotel(she lives with her parents- she has lived on her own but due to circumstances beyond her control she had to move home) and we didn’t want any uncomfortableness).  

Yesterday, she hit me with it.  She wants time alone to think, get her self on track.   Essentially for me to leave her alone.  And that her heart is with this other guy.  
I questioned how her heart could be with this guy after we made love on the cruise.  She doesn’t know.  I don’t know what this guy has over me.   
I was seriously considering changing my life and moving to her area- for her, but also for a new start- a new job, possibility of a family starting, better weather- it rains here all the damn time, etc.  There is nothing here for me.  No potential love- I’ve been on online dating, there’s just nothing here for me any more.  I live in a terribly unsocial area- people drink to be social, and I’m confident the choice of sobriety with her was the right one.  

She thinks I need to talk to a therapist, and not rely on her for my happiness- which I agree.  She does make me very happy.   She’s been the best friend I’ve ever had- her and I have been able to talk about everything under the sun, and it’s really helped me overcome some mental overthinking and worries I’ve had lately.  I’ve actually been sleeping at night, till now.  

She also doesn’t want me to come out to visit unless I can strictly be just friends only.  I’m finding that it’s terribly difficult to suppress my feelings, my care, etc for her.  That puts me out of almost $1000.  The money was never an issue for me, but it really sucks to just blow it like that.  I’ll probably still go out there, if she wants to see me, she can.  If not, I’ll try to enjoy my time alone :(.  

I reached out to a few local therapists that I thought I might be comfortable with talking to, all of which are incredibly expensive(not a lot around here accept insurance), and they all are booked up for months.  I’m on several waiting lists now, but all of them are uncertain if they’ll be able to see me in the coming months.  
These feelings I’m having are now, and they are real.  Waiting months isn’t something I can cope with.  My job ramps up excessively and becomes super stressful in the next coming months, and I’m not sure how I’m going to handle that either.  I do not want to put that stress or pressure on her.   She isn’t my therapist.  

I’m so heart wrenched right now.  It’s taking everything inside of me not texting her to see how her day is going.  How she’s feeling(recently was sick).   I’ve had waves of being super upset come over me when I think about this.  She’s stronger than I am.  

Instead, here I am spilling my feelings to strangers to see what they think, because I have no one else to talk to(considered positing this on relationships, lonely, but figure mental health was a good general community).  You all probably think that I’m crazy to fall for a girl so hard, but the heart wants what the heart wants.

I often feel guilty about things I can’t control. I have no motivation to do things I enjoy or things that I don’t enjoy but have to do. My mom is worried about me and telling me to not kill myself but that isn’t helping me. (I’m not suicidal). I’ve been crying out of confusion fairly often and I just feel hopeless.

147,"Hi, i'm a 20 years boy. I'm going to be as specific as I can so here is my story (english is my second or third language). I don't expect a lot of people to read this because it will be a long story which I will write anyway at least as a journal which I heard helps as well. I'll add timestamps to help my incoherency.

I recently figured out I have a depression that lasted for about 2 years (around sept 2017 - present time) and still going and it doesn't matter how much I try, I can't get myself out of it. I guess there are multiple causes of my depression because at that time it hit me from every aspect of life, I lost everything I thought I had and was left ""naked"". I don't know if these are things that typically happen to teenagers, but they happened to me, and I took them very personally. At this point I don't even know if I'm bitching about stupid things or I really got hit by something. Anyway, It changed me completely or... **I would say it somehow created me or slowly uncovered the real me**. I really don't remember when was the last time I felt some happiness, except the event I have written below at the end of the story. I'm specifically interested about the uncovering **the** **real self** i wrote below. If someone knows anything related to that, I would like to read more.

**Short self-description:** I can tell with no arrogance that I was always smarter then average. I was the genius kid in primary school and middle school. Introvert. I never had real social skills, and was pretty isolated. But I was a rich kid and the smartest in the room so extroverts adopted me really fast (yes, they were usually using me for self-gain). I was aware of my lack of social skills and in the 8-th grade it was my first time I tried and managed to have conversation with a girl from class for about an hour, while walking on our way to school. I mean I used to speak with my classmates, but only about something specifically. Never had long meaningful conversations, except boys. I had some good friends. But I was terrible with girls. There was one girl I liked and I never could make the first move, she liked me aswell btw. I was super anxious about this, so I only talked to her on social-media. It didn't get any further. After a about 2 years of only messaging I asked her out several times, but in an awful way and it didn't work out. It was all before 10 grade. I addressed a lot my lack of social skills and I managed to make a lot of friends there, which is how I got a girlfriend later on. After the 9 grade I changed my school and moved to one of the best high-schools in my country. There was where my genius collapsed. Everyone was smart and scared at the same time because of the high school requirements. I never had good grades after that. It took me 1 year and something to make some friends and to get social involved. In my 12 grade I got the girlfriend i'm writing right below. 

**Depression story:** Here is what happened 2 years ago: 

\-**I had a 2 year relationship** (aug 2016 - aug 2018) which started to become extremely toxic which ended 1 year later in rage;

\-**I finished one of the best high-schools** in my small country (2017) and decided not to go to university for 1 year in order to better decide what I want to do with my future, so I started a job at my family's small company as a helper manager or smth like that. Long story short, I was helping my father at what whatever was he doing.

\-At the time **I started working with my father**(sept 2017 - July 2018), he got in some serious financial problems, and my way of taking things for granted, everyone being nice to me because I was rich vanished. I had to contemplate my self being.

**How did the trouble begin?** 

**The stupid me in a relationship part.** I had a pretty nice relationship with that girl the first year and I was into the old fashioned way of serious relationships. I loved her the way a teenager does and I didnt recognize the moment when I had to breakup, and instead of 1 year of a nice relationship with a breakup, i had a second year of nightmare. She became distant, I felt unwanted. But as I didn't have social skills and I was backed up by money, I was delusional, and didn't breakup. I didn't breakup mainly because i wanted to have sex with her and I waited 1.5 years for that. We finally had it and the relationship didn't get any much better, contrary to my expectations. The second year of realtionship was very confusing. I knew something doesn't feel right, but it was that time I started to work with my family and didn't have enough time to figure it out. Also I had no evidence of her doing something wrong and i left things how they were. After a while, I just couldnt bear it anymore and broke up. 

**Here is the drama (betrayed by everyone) :** Shortly after the break up (aug 2018) 2 of her girl friends got in contact with me and told me all the shit she did behind my back. It wouldnt have been a big deal if the shit she did behind my back wasn't with people that I considered friends and best friends. Turn out she was a cheater, lier and didn't care about me at all, used to lie me even while crying to prove she doesn't lie, even though I was getting some suspicious half-evidence. I learned that she was seeing and at least once kissed a guy who I was considering to be my best friend for like 2 years (I had a lot of common interests with him, we were very alike and worked together on a project). It was like a double betrayal. She cheated on me with several guys, was desvirginated at some party after I went home (after one year of relationship). There is another guy who I considered to be my best friend for most of my life, I knew him since kindergarten, were in the same class for 9 years, sitted at the same desk in middle-school (i went to another high-school after). Turns out he became her emotional support after the fight I had with her after breakup and now they are still dating (She still cheats though, the guy doesn't know). I was betrayed by everyone, and by everyone I mean the fact that a lot of people knew what's going on and no one tried to light me up. After that, I realised that actually I have no one to talk to. And they really were people I considered closest to me and they were the only people I was really trusting. Probably here is where I completely stopped trusting people. The only close friends I have right know are 2 guys I met in high-school. I'm still in close touch with them, even though they are studying in different cities/countries. I have to mention that they are high-standards people. Both of them are extremely disciplined, hard-working, rational, and i'm sure they are going to be super successful, and usually they help me to get over my dark moments).  

**Meanwhile working with my father (insane amount of stress)**(sep 2017 - July 2018)...  I was working with my father, who turned out to be an extremely toxic boss. I figured out I never knew him. He never talked to me or supported me like a normal father would. In fact, i was educated by my extremely soft mother. I'm not delusional. All my relatives have the same opinion about him and her. He was only telling me his bussiness stories and how successful he is. In fact, he never was. At the same time he got in some serious financial trouble with his business, the money ended and I went from rich kid to ""question my existence"" kid. It hit me by making me question myself what is my personality based on, because I was used to taking things for granted just because I had money and everyone would like to befriend me. This is when I started teaching myself creating websites in order to do some freelancing work. My father was is an extremely impulsive person, I am extremely calm and rational. We were 2 opposites. Because of his way of impulsively managing things, I was getting more and more stressed with the work. In a pretty short period of time **I started sleeping 12-13 hours per night** and didn't feel rested (it was at the same time my girlfriend started being distant and at the same time I started having depression symptoms). After almost an year working with him I had a **stress crisis**, it was something like an **epileptic seizure**, but I was conscious and half an hour later I ended up in hospital, had to take opioids. My father still didn't do anything to address that. By his way of thinking, ""My nerves are as weak as my mother's"". I have to mention that my mother consistently takes opioids in order to cope with the stress my father creates. He is not physically violent, he never was, but he is extremely loud, and almost always raging (exactly my opposite). Luckily, after that, I moved abroad to study, were, unluckily, **my biggest and most cronic depression episode started**. (October 2018, right after breakup, after cheating and betrayal from almost everyone I knew, after toxic father) And it was right after all the relationship drama, betraying friends, and toxic father. I was barely sleeping at night, no way of getting asleep before 3 am for half an year, absolute chaos, couldn't talk to anyone(there was only one friend that used to call me from time to time for what I will always be grateful), I have no idea how I got over those months. I couldn't get over anything. I didn't know I need help. The only thing that kept me from having serious suicidal thoughts was the voice in my head that was telling me that I still have potential and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. That voice i think is the critical side of my personality that would keep me afloat in the darkest moments of my life by reminding me that there will be better days, or maybe I was too much of a coward to end it all. 

**Here is more about my current self**. I'm a smarter than average person except the social thing. I am student right know in my second year learning economic informatics, studying abroad and I'm the best at programming lessons in my group while doing considerably less effort than my colleagues, I mean I barely study at all because of my depression. I never had social skills and still have no idea how to get along with poeple from my class, but don't get me wrong, I worked as a freelancer after I taught myself developing websites and still have very good relations with my clients. **I can't get along with people** that I have no common interests with, i won't ever speak to them if I don't have a specific reason to and I'm talking about my current colleagues. There is no one I can get along with. I was like this all my life, since I was a kid. I tried to contemplate why I am like this numerous times, but no result. I simply think I'm better than they are and I think they aren't the same level I am. And by that I mean that there is a voice in my head arrogantly telling me I'm better than others and there is the other voice criticizing it and reminind me that I won't live up to those expectations of myself any time soon because of my depression. I'm not arrogant by saying this, it's just what I think, I keep my humility while i'm around others and i play the nice guy, I'm just aware that I can do thing others can not. 

Also I still don't know what I mean by ""same level as me"". The only explanation I have for myself is that there are very few people with whom I can get along and who can understand things with a greater perspective than usual.

It's my second year at this university and there is only one girl I met with whom I could really get along and speak ""at the same level"". **She is a super balanced person**, lives up to standards that look impossible for me to have because of depression and last year she had one of the highest average grades. 

**I was trying to discipline myself** in order to get better and get myself out of dark. I worked as a freelancer because my family **hardly could support me anymore** and I didn't even want to request money from them, but I did from time to time as I was literally starving. I developed some wordpress websites, had some good clients. My dream job was and still is to be a programmer. The rational and logical way of thinking that this job requires is completely suitable for me, but I had to learn a lot in order to get such a job. Therefore, at that time I was mainly doing design, which turned out to be something I hated so much it would make me burn out in a couple of hours, but I had no choice. I didn't expect that doing design work would make me more vulnerable to episodes of depression. 

(**October 2018 - Jan 2019**) **After 4 months of severe depression** I started to force myself to work on something. I was programming my day for productivity. It lasted 2 weeks and those were some of the most productive periods of time I ever had. By that time I had a complete understanding of business plans, how to make one, and actually made one. I did that by studying one specialisez book and a lot of internet resources. Right after these 2 weeks I collapsed. Lately, and by that I mean about 1 month ago I discovered I was self-sabotaging myself. After every try of getting better I finish up by punishing myself, procastinating, not carrying, and making myself to turn things in such a way so I would feel desperate.

**(March, 2019)** Meanwhile I descovered **Jordan Peterson**, and started reading some books like ""**No more Mr. Nice guy**"" which was exactly my description, ""**Iron John**"", ""**4 archetypes of men**"" etc. I got insights about the **masculine psychology** which explained to me why all of these things happened to me, I understood why i got betrayed, why my father was like that and everythhing. But it didn't motivate me trust people anymore, there were no arguments to sustain it. **Apparently, I started to get better**. I started dating that girl I was talking about. I started taking care of myself, doing more things to myself, exercising, eating much healthier, cooking for myself, made friends at the hostel I lived (which by the way didn't make me any happier. I was feeling like i'm stagnating, pausing my self discovery while losing a lot of time with people I don't really have a lot to learn from). I was desperate to get better. Back in March I applied to a marketing training at my university, where we made teams and worked on a project. I had previous experience in marketing since I was developing websites and I had more knowledge in the field than the average and some of them I barely talked to referred to me as being a genius. It was then when I realised that marketing is burning me out just like designing websites does as it requires the same way of thinking. There were a lot of people, but I couldn't get close to anyone, not even with the people from my team I worked with. I don't know what's the catch with that because I was being myself there, i was pretty happy, not really depressed, but it wasn't fulfilling. I felt like these people could never understand. Also at the same time I had to work on a big website, which completely burned me out. And another episode of depression kicked in. I couldn't provide enough of myself to the relationship and broke up after 1 month (still friends btw, I still appreciate her more than any girl I have ever met), couldn't get myself together, failed 1 exam**. I was punishing myself again, self-sabotaging, making me feel desperate.** Even though I collapsed, I was able to keep disciplining myself for more than a month, which was a record, I forced it as hard as I could, and I really have to mention that in this period of time I was able to solve an insane amount of personal problems, made an amount of money that allowed me to buy a new powerful laptop, a phone, and still had money to party all summer. All that in one month and half.  

I have to mention about my decision to work as a freelancer. I didn't want to lose time by working on some job that only required my time. I decided that my time is somewhat more important and used it to learn creating websites.

**After that specific collapse (Half April - July)**, I was still partly trying to take care of myself, trying to figure out ways of being more of myself, to embrace my wild instincts and the masculine self which I never did and to get easier with myself. By that I mean I was always rational, I was never impulsive and i was repressing my feelings with cowardness which I thought was rationality, I used to let people walk me over.

**(July - September 2019)** So here the summer begins with me still depressed. I went home, had tons of free time to complete some programming tutorials i planned earlier and to get better. Of course i didn't look at them even once. But the good part is that a lot of my **friends from high-school I still trusted** were home as well and we partied a lot. It didn't improve my situation, but... **There was one party** with 5 of my high-school friends and 2 girls that were friends with one of them. I tried to be as much of myself as I could and I tried to express my masculine self as much as I could. So I got drunk, and I mean really drunk. It felt like the best thing that happened to me in the last 2 years. I felt some sort of happiness I don't rememeber feeling for a very long time. Even if i was drunk as fuck after drinking more than 15 shots **I never felt more in control of myself** in my enitre life. **I could perfectly embrace my masculine self** and my rational self it was the moment **I really felt alive**. Currently, I'm pretty good at controlling myself while being drunk, and there is no chance to make the wild man from inside to take control so perhaps this is why I could feel the perfect balance. Even if my friends tried to make it out with those girls, I had both of them interested in me while not even trying. One of the girls just kissed me out of nowhere while dancing. And I really didn't even try to make it out with any of them because I was not interested. I still can't explain that episode of pure happiness, it felt like heaven, I was feeling that I have all power I need to to anything I want with my life, i felt the alpha male from inside, I felt that I could get along with anybody, while of course keeping my filter of ""not being at the same level"", but just cassually making friends, I was feeling like the perfect man I was always to be or better to say **to be the self i'm trying to uncover from inside,** because I know that the person I was in touch with when being drunk was the real me, the broken and reborn self. Sadly, I couldn't reproduce it while not being drunk. There were some other parties but I didn't get that drunk, therefore I didn't feel the hidden self just as intense. I can't get along with girls because I'm never living the present moment, I'm ambiguous.

**(October - 2019) Here I am**. University started again, finally started to learing more of programming. I'm getting better at it, and i'm getting better really fast. Fast enough to get a job in about on month. After about 3 months of depression I did pretty good at university for those 3 weeks, managed my time well enough. Started to have a high protein breakfast in order to deal with anxiety, which by the way worked better then I have expected. Besides uni, my current program consists of doing about 3 - 4 hours per day of learning programming. I have time for more, but for some reason I can not bear more than that. I don't hate it, **i enjoy what I do, but it's exhausing, it burnes me out slowly**. I have some assigments to do, but the thought of doing them is killing me. It's hard for me to do what I like to do(programming, but programming in real life applications. The way of programming we learn at university is far from giving me a chance to get employed) but taking time to do smth not exactly related to what I want to do right know(getting a job, learning programming) is stressing me out too hard to bear. And I sarted to collapse again. I feel how I'm slowly punishing myself, procastinating and getting less and less care of myself. After 3 weeks of doing pretty good at uni, I completely missed the last 2 days of lectures because I couldn't get myself in a mood to go there. **Everything gets too painful again.**

**Some of the reasons I can't accomplish basic daily goals are:**

\- **Sleep problems**. It's my biggest problem. It doesn't matter how early I go to sleep or how tired I am, I still fall asleep after 00.00. It can get me hours to get asleep if I go to bed earlier. It doesn't matter how much I sleep. I tried sleeping from 6 to 10 hours. Still yawning all day and getting tired way too fast. Even if I get tired, I can't get afternoon naps because I just can't fall asleep;

\- **Mood changing**. My moods can change really fast. I'm pretty sure I didn't become bipolar, but my moods vary a lot.

\- **Lack of focus**. It's basic.

\- **Social activities, talking to people.** During my dark times when I was freelancing, it would take me days to call that client for most basic things. It was triggering such an anxiety and such pain that **I was trembling for hours**. I even lost a customer because I could make myself make a call for 2 or 3 weeks. And the calls where just to inform some basic things, I was actually doing pretty great as a web designer.

\- **Can't stop thinking about the past**, everywhere, always.

I also have all the other **depression symptoms**, but those are the most significant.

Right know I'm waiting for to get a job. I am going to apply in about 1 month. I hope that that evnironment would help my mental health, but at the same time **I fear that I would not be able to bear a 8 hours** a day job and doing uni at the same time. I desperately need a job because a lot of anxiety and depression comes from the fact that I'm not fully independent, and I hate to request money from my family. I want to rent a flat, and live alone. Deep inside I feel I need time being alone. If getting a job would not make my mental health get any better, I will go to a psychologist/psychoterapist. I didn't go yet because I can't aford one (I'm not a hypocrite, I had money a while ago when I was partying that summer. But I really thought it was the end of my depression). Also, I'm kinda getting pleasure from my isolation, I don't won't any people ""who do not understand"" in my life. And I do not know what I mean by that, I just know there are such high quality people. I find them from time to time, people with limitless minds.

As I said earlier, **the only thing keeping me away from suicidal thoughts** or away from something darker than what currently is, is the critical side of my personality that judges me and finally tells me I still got potential, that there is a fix, that there are books about that and that someday it will get better, but until then, I'm self-destructive. Sometimes I see a light at the end of the tunnel by thinking of the big family I will build and I will be able to trust, but it's too damn away from the present time...

I identified my critical self as being a really strong Magician archetype, which allows me to survive in the darkness.

 I can't keep friends for that long because they always end up thinking I'm insincere and cold-hearted, I get so bored when I have no one to talk to that it makes me feel like throwing up so I don't want to lose all my friends forever. I don't necessarily like the idea of feeling guilty for things (because the concept is honestly kinda stupid) but if it gives me friends that don't leave the second they have the chance to then I guess it's a good thing but I don't get why or how me not being sad for things that helped me get the things I wanted is a bad thing, I'm confused and It's making me angry because I don't understand. 

People also expect me to feel sad when people die but I just don't, it's not that I didn't enjoy being around them, it's just once they're dead there's nothing I can do about it so why should I be sad, and that apparently also makes people not want to be friends with me? Isn't being sad all the time bad? why do they tell me that I'm a cruel person when I say I don't feel sad or I don't feel guilty. 

I'm really angry and confused right now, I just want people to understand that even though if they died I wouldn't feel sad, I still enjoy their company and want to be friends. I am able to make friends really easily but after a month or even sometimes after just a few weeks they decide they don't like me anymore even though I try my best to make them happy.",20Oct2019,2

I know it sounds weird, but lemme explain:

Psychological violence can be extremely hurtful to the people who have been receiving it, to the point that the person even... *likes it*. Those people, how their brains, how their neurons understood psychological PAIN as a good thing, how they like it, they smile, they even *want* to get hurt... It's fucking amazing

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been intrigued by human emotions, how do they work, and what leads to people to do such things as murder, violence, raping, mental deterioration, etc. What did they to make their brains think its either worth it or good to do that, people who have been so severely damaged, that they want to end their lives... holy fuck

&amp;#x200B;

But at the point of being so extremely damaged that you like being mentally hurt, you even *need* it, those people who keep a smile on their face while inside being full and full of negative thoughts, killing that person from the inside so brutally that he/she feels no more pain, its fucking awful and fascinating what people are capable to do to other people, what are our brains capable of making us *feel* like...

&amp;#x200B;

The ""I love the way it *hurts*"", I wonder what that person has lived to be like that, how bad must he/she is feeling, and what could I do to help h/s, to make hm/hr more mentally stable...

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear your opinion about this, and if you have reached this far, I just wanna say you thank you :)

151,"I recently started a new stage in my life that involves a high amount of daily stress. I’ve also recently been experiencing some very weird sensations, and was wondering if anyone can shed some light. 

When brushing anything, like taking a broom to a stone floor, I get this weird frustrating sensation. When brushing my teeth it’s the same way. Literally brushing anything but it’s worse when there’s stuff to sweep up like dust or sand. 

I’m not sure what it is or how to stop it but it’s very distracting. If also is very frustrating.

153,"I have a friend who suffers from depression. She believes that nothing except drugs will help, and that talking to a psychiatrist will do nothing. She seemingly believes that she needs to be on antidepressants for the rest of her life. I am of the belief that antidepressants need to be paired with therapy, i.e. talking to a psychiatrist to work through problems. When debating the use of psychiatric drugs, I expressed that I believe that such drugs aren't necessarily to be taken long term, and certainly not for the rest of your life. She says that any negative long term side effects from the medicine are not outweighed by the benefit these drugs would have. I want opinions on this debate.",20Oct2019,2

I just need to learn to give her more space and time to do her own things since I can't literally cling to her 24/7. A person who lives close just joined her relationship. She was at first only dating a guy who lives like an hour away but she can see her new partner a lot more than him. My girlfriend will stay over her house, or she will come here for two nights a week. I'm just incredibly anxious and half the time I'm not really sure why, I'm worried I won't be able to deal with it, even though I need more time to myself anyway to re-kindle old friendships that I let die down a little due to being so clingy.

157,"I'm a (young end) middle aged man living with his long term partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give a bit of history, my relationship with my Mother has been a bit patchy over the years. Especially as a teenager when she left my area in the country and barely visited. I felt pretty unimportant to her. She has always been difficult in that her opinions on some subjective things aren't flexible quite often. She's not a very open person. Up until recently all of her siblings had basically severed ties with her due to not wanting to deal with her constant projection and judgement I suppose. I managed to get her and her sister interacting again to lessen some of the burden I feel. She is also pretty hypocritical in that she can be hypersensitive about certain topics and expect you to tiptoe around her feelings but then completely disregard yours when she is on a tirade (often about something very petty). Lately we had counselling and had managed to overcome some history and have somewhat of a normal relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

However, yesterday I received an email from her (when she is angry she sends emails as it minimizes how personal the interaction is and allows her, I think, psychologically, to really let loose). She had been through my Facebook timeline, seen that I had posted a joke not intended for her that contained a swearword, and had now decided that I was a malicious asshole and needed to retract the filth that had come out of my mouth. Fuming, as the counselor had specifically told her not to send emails anymore I sent her a somewhat angry message telling her that a) she wasn't the intended audience, b) learn to think contextually c) I'm not retracting anything as she's the only one that took offence etc etc. She replied back adamant that I was a horrible person and one day I would realize that I should retract what I said blah blah. I really find this quite ironic as growing up with her many different boyfriends I distinctly remember them telling jokes that were completely filthy and not once did she object on moral grounds.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at my wits end with this woman. I feel that I will never gain her approval. I am not doing well economically and am struggling emotionally and financially. I have been depressed and suicidal recently. I really don't have the energy to deal with her and don't find any joy or meaning in the relationship. However on the other hand she is my mother and is elderly. I'm entertaining the idea of severing ties with her and am miserable with the conundrum. Please help me wise members of mental health.",20Oct2019,1
