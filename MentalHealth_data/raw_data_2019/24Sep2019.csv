0,"I've been battling depression for years. But every time it hits me real bad, I always, ALWAYS avoid playing video games.

The last time I got depressed (I'm talking near-suicidal), I just used Super Smash Bros Wii U and Super Mario 3D World just to get through the day. My best friend and I had a falling out, and it really hurt me. I just kept playing those games to cope with the depression. After four months of it, we reconciled. But now I cannot even LOOK at those games because I associate them with a bad time. Even thinking about it makes me feel sick.",24Sep2019,3
1,"I ought to care more about this job but I don't. I've been hating this job since November and all I want to do is focus on my studies in the hopes it will take me elsewhere. I got called into the office because again there is a recurring issue of me not being careful with reading things over and my business emails aren't formal. I didn't say I was going to do better instead I was aggravated at how checked I am out of this job and I am more angry that I got caught.

Why did I mess up during undergrad? Why couldn't I just stop bouncing around and be more deliberate in my choices I made. I halted therapy due to cost and I'm back on here writing out my pain so to speak.

4,"I am a female highschool senior and I haven’t put a single thought into college. The thought of leaving home scares me. I don’t want to leave my family. I dont know how I would make it on my own. I am afraid that if I leave for college I will further isolate, and without the support of my family I fear ill barely be able to get out of bed and  that ill waste their money by not having the motivation to go to my classes. I have been a top student all my life, my weighted gpa is a 4.4 and I am told I could get into any school i wanted to with my academic accomplishments. My interests in life are writing and editing for film but I dont know how im supposed to function handling school, a job or life. My grades are slipping because I just dont see a point in trying if it feels like my life will be over soon anyways. In general, I feel like I am invisible and am starting to think I just wasn’t meant to “live a life” if that makes sense. Its as if my purpose is to sit and do nothing  like an empty soul for the rest of my life and honestly at this point that doesnt sound too bad. I dont have suicidal thoughts, and I really try my hardest to put myself out there, make friends, socialize, be happy, dress nice  and think about the pros of creating a life for myself, but in the end I am only filled with fear and depression and loneliness. I don’t feel like I have a future and I have all this pressure on me about what Im gonna do with my life and I feel like such a failure because I dont have an answer for my friends, teachers or family. I havent opened up about my feelings on college to anyone. I have told my parents about how I am kinda depressed but I don’t think Ive communicated well enough how lost I feel and how bad it really is. I never open up to my friends about how im feeling due to the fact that I dont feel close enough to anyone, and I dont express my feelings through social media either. This is my first time really admitting that I am desperately struggling with my mental health and what I am looking for is others who feel the same way as me and to be heard.",24Sep2019,2
5,"(Please do not read if hearing about sexual abuse will upset you!)
TLDR at bottom 


I have had mental health issues my whole life, (from anxiety when I was 2 due to witnessing something traumatic, depression when I was 6+, and eating disorders since then... it’s been a wild ride to say the least) Anyway, I considered myself doing so much better the last couple of years (I’m 21/F) I’ve been off all meds, not been admitted to hospital since I was 17, maintaining my weight etc. 

A year and a half ago, I was sexually abused. It happened so fast, I thought it was my fault for not just leaving, and it was “only” digital r*pe (no genitalia of his involved..) so it “didn’t count”. I wasn’t upset about it for too long, I got on with it, didn’t go to the therapy the sexual assault clinic sent me to, I just thought it wasn’t a big deal because it wasn’t violent or serious. And there were so many people in the room, so if they had thought I lied, then maybe it actually wasn’t as bad as I thought and I didn’t want to come across as a liar. 

Lately, though, my eating disorder has come back with a bang, my anxiety is through the roof and whereas I wouldn’t say I’m “depressed” I definitely get episodes where I cry a LOT. I have a sort of “little” persona that tends to come out whenever I think about it or anything that’s going on in my life. It’s very NON SEXUAL, it is purely as if I have almost regressed a little bit and just need comfort, hugs, and some positivity from my boyfriend (never happens wit anyone else). 
It’s not like I’m a different person or anything but I will suddenly just almost act like a child and cry and cry and cry, like a child who has fallen and hurt themselves. I get horrible nightmares which I’ve never had in my life, and I’ll wake up crying needing my boyfriend  

Basically, I’m embarrassed, my boyfriend is amazing with it all but I’m fucking embarrassed. It’s only today I’ve thought it may be related to trauma. I can’t talk about it in therapy because I don’t know where to begin. I don’t know what’s happening me or how to deal with it. Any advice is warmly welcomed. 

Tldr; r*ped a year ago, wasn’t effected til now, gets very childish to cope with it and get comfort, embarrassed, help please lmao",24Sep2019,4

7,"This will sound dark, but it’s the thing I’ve found the most helpful recently. I lay down, eyes closed, and preferably in the dark. I then empty my lungs, doing so by letting them fall naturally. I’ll let that slowly occur over the course of a few seconds, and then, once they are empty, I simply let them stay that way. While I lay there, yearning for breath, every single issue in my life suddenly seems meaningless. After a while, you will have to breath, and it will feel amazing. I will do this over and over again, until I have no issues appearing in my head when I’m not breathing. It might sound dark, but I think that putting yourself through something like that will change your perspective. It makes me become much, much more peaceful, especially if I follow it by very intentionally breathing and thinking positively. I hope this helps anyone.",24Sep2019,1
8,"I've been battling depression for the majority of my life, nearly killed myself last December, my family and I almost ended up homeless. Everyone I care about seems to be fading away from me and caring less and less about me as the days go on; each day is a struggle to even get out of bed. I've tried looking for a job for nearly 2 years now, applied for 5 different ones over that period and got rejected every time; I'm at the point where I don't even want to try anymore. Being rejected 5 times has crippled my self esteem, my grandmother passing away when I was 11/12 and my mother nearly killing herself multiple times when I was little put me into a horrible mental state which I have yet to recover from.

I am going to therapy, but I feel like it's done nothing good for me at all. I have no friends outside of the ones I met online and I am thankful that they stayed with me and my shitty personality for all this time.

9,"every friday night me and my group of friends always, literally always hungout and had a great time. weed was present (i have a history with weed but i slowed down the previous year to that point) or beer and we always had fun and discussed controversial issues and anything happened but it was the best time of my life. at some point i started to use stimulants again and would help out a buddy or two every now and then. at some point i stopped selling it to them because i saw no point in “regetting my stuff” and i felt bad cause i know what its like to be without it whether i had cash or was broke and i care about them, i love my friends. my dad is the only one other than my grandmom who has a license but for two weeks it seemed like i was blowing my friends off cause “it was too far of a drive” (20 minutes, i need to get my license lol). after that point i completly decided to stop using and i think rumor had it i wanted to stop hanging out with certain people to stop using but idk just another thought that makes me feel bad someone said that. so days of fatigue passed seeming endlessly in dread and exhaustion, then the next week. i used again on the next weekend cause it was just so goddamn endless and pathetic, and it really just repeated like that for a month. after all that time, i felt no different, no better, no worse. just in a big lonely void. friends had called but i had no energy and felt negative cause i didnt answer last time. there have been two points where i thought about suicide but i stayed strong. they came over more often during this period but recently nobodys came for 2 weeks. i feel great when talking to them, but when theyre not here im stuck with my thoughts and daily problems. i have been taking care of my grandmom cause she has curved in knees and had cancer in one of them and over the span of time when i wasnt with friends ive been doing my best to take care of her the best that i can do. unfortunatly the pain is so excutiating she hasnt been getting up to walk, my dad works and gets laid off from time to time so we’re in a constant struggle and internal struggle because me and him dont get along. im always doing what i need to do but he is a SLOB. the house will be wrecked in a heartbeat and im left with to repeat again the next day. to summarize (rant alert), im in a constant cycle i cant get out of, i want to see my friends but im out of energy from not using uppers, and if i leave i dont think my dad will watch my grandmom all night, but i cant anyway cause its too far of a drive, and then the week starts again and im just drowning in frustration. idk whether to talk to someone or rant but goddamn hitting rock bottom hurts",24Sep2019,1
10,"I wrote a diary in prison. I'm typing out the entries and putting them online as a blog. It *might* be helping me with my PTSD. I'm posting it here because today's entry discussed a common mental health condition in prison and I thought some of you might enjoy.  


Prison is 70% mental health, 20% of that is severe. In case you ever have a chance to help, 100% of inmates have one main issue: poor self image. It's ubiquitous and if prisons would address that, we'd see real change.

13,"When I talk to my family or my best friend, I sound completely normal. However, when I speak to anyone, I mean ANYONE else(not exaggerating), I struggle to talk greatly. I always struggle no matter what, but most of the time I can function like normal and get by with it. Sometimes, randomly, it gets extremely difficult for a single word to get out. I just ordered food at a restaurant and it extremely hard to speak. My voice changes pitch(usually much lower, sometimes higher), it's very quiet, and it feels like I'm hoarse. I can't even order fucking food. This makes my life extremely difficult sometimes. I hate it. My family doesn't know about my anxiety but they have noticed my voice change a little when I talk to others around them. It's extremely embarrassing. What kind of worthless person am I not to be able to just speak to others? I can't function as a human being. It's all over the place though. Sometimes I can speak almost like normal, other times I can't speak at all. Five years ago I got fired from my first job for failing to communicate with my coworkers. I've been trying to get better since then with little progress. Just go see a therapist you might say. Well I don't have money if I can't work... My university has free counseling but I think I would need the best professional therapist there is to cure me. I avoid talking to my parents about it because it's extremely embarrassing. My dad knows nothing about it. My mom has general anxiety disorder but doesn't understand my social anxiety. I tried explaining it to her but she wouldn't listen. She thought I was crazy. I don't know what to do. I'm struggling in college, I was granted medical leave last year and I'm trying to do better this year. I can't work, can't afford therapy, can't function like a normal human being. I get severely depressed sometimes because of this. I applied for disability but was denied and I didn't appeal it.

14,"Hi, I have a couple friends who have a bad habit of partaking in patterns that are damaging to themselves. As a friend who cares, I find it often difficult to just sit back and watch without giving my two cents. This, however, has led to them becoming defensive towards me and pushing me away. 

Is the best move for me simply to distance myself? Is there anything more I can do to help? One of them is pretty self aware and told me they don’t want to change, even though they know they should.

21,"So I was put in a mental health institution about 2 or 3 days ago I forgot it's been a very busy time of my life. I was actively homicidal when I checked in and still am (i told my therapist this). But it doesn't seem like bad homicidal I know from god that I was sent down or up from either heaven or hell to fix some things (smiting unrighteous) but like that drive to do those things comes and goes and sometimes I think I am just a regular person. I don't hear voices or anything I just know that god has sent me as a judge of his holy will and  sometimes I don't feel like that at all and just feel well like everybody else. And I don't necessarily want to kill these people but they are evil and need judgement (an example of someone would be an abusive parent, a serial rapist or so forth) and I am just speeding up the process. But I don't want to kill them brutally I just want to do it quickly and quietly so they don't feel pain, why do i feel this way, my therapist hasn't told me anything and it's frustrating.

( I literally cannot finish watching a youtube video without these scenarios torturing me)  
I cannot keep the same opinion for even a day. My day goes by feeling Anger, sadness, Irritability, anxiety, confusion and not knowing how to even feel. Sometimes even someone walking past me will set me off. I feel extreme unmotivated because of the mental fatigue.  
i break down a lot due to not being able to be happy, i cry for no reason sometimes and i snap at my friends feeling completely justified and then later i look and see how easily i got angry.   
My whole dads side of the family is bipolar, so it wouldn't surprise me if i had something.  
I feel as if i don't have an identity as i am always changing my views, way of thinking, doing things.

29,"Ugh. Bipolar 2 here. I get really bad panic attacks sometimes despite being on medication. I hate panic attacks more than anything, and it seems that whenever I start to feel good and happy one hits. 

I've tried a lot of different coping mechanisms. Deep breathing does not work for me. Grounding myself by noting my surroundings also doesn't work for me. Usually I try to ground myself, by telling myself that this feeling isn't going to last forever, even though it feels like it will. For me panic attacks make me feel like I'm dying even though logically I know that I'm not. The worst part is that I feel trapped by it. I can't escape it because it's in my head, and I'm stuck there. My mind suddenly becomes a prison I can't escape.

My best friend of 9 years unexpectedly died last night. She has a mass on her spleen that ruptured. She was fine before. I got home from work and she was barely able to move and breathing so heavily. I brought her to the emergency vet clinic and there was nothing we could do. 

It was one of the most traumatic things I’ve been through, and I’ve been through a lot. I was able to see my therapist today and everyone has been incredibly supportive.

She’s been with me through the most shit I’ve ever dealt with in my entire life. I appreciate everyone but no one can bring my dog back. I don’t know how I’m supposed to keep on going when life keeps shitting on me and then on top of it took my best friend in the entire world from me.

I just wanted to write it out I guess because it just feels better. If anyone has been through this how did you cope? I don’t want to continue on, I feel like I’m being dramatic because she “was just a dog” but I can’t do this.

My mom has cancer, my home life in general is a mess, I’ve been though literally so much I just can’t even write it all out. I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel stable, I tried expressing that to my therapist I just don’t think she got it. I can’t stop blaming myself for not spending more time with her, just going on another hike just ANYTHING.

33,"from about 8 years old I remember throwing up after meals and restricting my calories I’ve never been obese but I was chubby, I was young and I would only throw up when I was really full. In 2016 I was 15 it was late summer my aunt made a comment to me “you’re too fat to be vegan” I was vegan for about 3 years at the time and this is where the pot stirred, I lost 25 pounds in about a month and half going from 160 pounds at 5’3 to 135 and by January I had just turned 16 I was 115 pounds then by April I was at my lowest 112, my hair fell out, I had heart palpitations, I was doing a lot of shit. By late June I was “recovering” going out with friends again, living a teen life, worried about my weight in the back of my mind but I didn’t let it control me. The rest of the year goes by and I would only go back to my eating disorder once in a while it wasn’t full time, of course the thoughts were always there but I wasn’t acting upon them. 2018 rolls around and I had gained every pound I lost back and maybe a little more. I deleted all social media Iissed out on all of senior year I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize myself, never took pictures, shut everyone out, it was hard but I was fighting my eating disorder I didn’t wanna go back to it. December 2018 comes around and I decided I wanted to be thin for my 18th birthday in January so I went back into my old ways and she’s about 18 pounds in a month, I started going out with friends again, everyone complimented me I felt like me again. I contained my eating disorder until about March, then I decided to work out 5 times a week cardio/weight training, I felt great I had energy, I was eating healthy portions, I felt in control. I went on the scale and I gained even more weight and I’m aware muscle weighs more than fat but I cried, and I got blood work done and my sugar was high so I gave up. Here I am, I’m 18 I miss my eating disorder so much, I hate looking at myself in the mirror I don’t weigh myself because it makes me genuinely suicidal and I went from weighing myself 20 times a day to not even looking at a scale.

 Some days I feel good about myself, I'm so energised and I laugh at nothing, more confident than usual, I definitely wouldn't call it happy though. it's usually not the full day though, it's quite fleeting honestly . 
Other times I go through days where I feel really low and cry for no reason, when this happens I sometimes feel sad af and like life is a giant sigh, other times I cry and feel nothing. These sad/nothing states last longer than the buzzing states. Like I say normally days.

This only made her mental health worse because the theraphy didnt work and made her agressive (she got over sensitivity disorder diagnose even she have  boderline personality disorder). We easily make ourselves look like we are the victimis even we want to tell the truth. Thats why its important that someone else is giving their side of the story about our situation.

I suffer from anxiety and depression, but no other illnesses that I’m aware of. I’m suddenly not feeling welcome by my friends. And I think every time they whisper to each other it’s about me. My auditory hallucinations range from music, to people whispering my name or things to me. While my suicidal thoughts are rather intrusive. I don’t really have a desire to kill myself. It’s just that I know that I’m gonna die anyways, and there’s so many ways I could end it for myself. And I could get out of school and other stressful responsibilities if I did die. My homicidal thoughts, or whatever you call them scare me the most. I space out, and suddenly start thinking about what it would be like to beat somebody to death, or some other type of murder.

48,"So backstory, almost a year a go my(M18) ex(F18) cheated on me by posting pictures of herself on a discord chat filled with minors, known perverts, a potential rapist(his gf at the time accused him of assault but she wouldn't explain, let us get help, or get help herself so all of her friends left it be. I found out months after the accusations) , and straight up bullies. Now not everyone in that chat was like that but you get the idea. 
Anyway right before she dumped me she would talk daily about this one guy(M15) everyday I got a little jealous but let it be since he lived 2 states away, and knowing how hard it was for her to make friends. Then it escalated she started to talk about how handsome, cute, tall, and amazing he was, she even talked about his dick size to me. I started to tell her she needed to stop and that her talking about him has gone on for over a month and I can't take it anymore. She stopped talking about him for a short while about a week and she never stopped talking to him even when she and I were together on dates. I was at my breaking point. Then I saw the pictures and this wasn't the first time either. During the first year of our relationship she got pressured to show her lingerie to her ex while they facetimed. I know I should've left then but she was honest with me and I blamed it on her anxious nature and tried to forgive but I couldn't forget. Then I saw everything happening again after 3 years of being together she does the same thing except she wasn't pressured or even told to she did it on her own all because one of her friends was doing it as well. I was mad I angry cried to her and demanded a weekend break so I could cool off and think about everything. She then wanted the break to go on a week I only wanted a reason but since I was denied a simple reason other than it's what I want. I didn't let her have it. I got mad that she took the pictures and she's now replacing me with some internet stranger who so far has only belittled me for not giving her the time she asks for or not being good enough. She just dumped me being mad I didnt give her space and that I was accusing her of replacing me. Recently she popped up in conversation again and against my better judgement I looked at her insta and saw her talking about how much she loves that guy. I loved her so much and after almost a year I'm still heartbroken. I've been bullied most of my life, even to the point I thought they'd kill me, but this unshakable feeling of betrayal hurts the most.

Tldr: she cheated on me and left with a minor.",24Sep2019,1
49,"  To preface this, I’m only 16. I’ve been self-harming for two years but haven’t had suicidal thoughts till a few months ago. No one knows about my self harm or how depressed I fell most of the time. Most of the time my suicidal thoughts were just thoughts that I could brush off, I mean I wasn’t actually going to kill myself, I wouldn’t want to hurt my family like that. But recently I had an episode of a few days were I was research ways to end my life, I couldn’t focus on anything else other than the idea committing suicide. At the time I didn’t see anything wrong with it, I was almost ready to do it. The bad mood kinda just lifted all of the sudden. I don’t feel amazing now, but definitely not as bad as I did before.

  Looking back this kinda scares me. If that happens again any time soon I don’t know if I’ll be able to get myself out of that thought process. I think I need to tell someone about this stuff but I’m to scared. I kept it inside for so long. Thank you for reading this far. I would really appreciate any replies or advice.",24Sep2019,2

I'm a pretty chill person, a person who would laugh on the lamest of jokes and sees a funny side to everything and anything. 

I recently received an amazing job offer which made a little scared but since I thought ""we should run towards the stuff we're scared at, to grow in life"" 

I accepted the offer. 

The work culture is the best! CEO and everyone is so welcoming, it feels amazing but.... 

As any company, they have expectations on me. Well, it's a work I've been doing for many months now and they want me to do the same for them... 

It makes me scared, anxious.etc that I'm now working for a company, I was a freelancer before who worked on my own terms... 

Last night, I wanted to sleep but a meeting that was going to happen late at night, didn't let me sleep. 

I woke up, I was getting sweaty, I was crying, I could feel a mild pain in my chest and I was short on breath. 

It was a bad feeling.. 

I googled and found out that it's called ""panic attack"" 


Idk what to do now. Do I fight this and continue in the company or else quit and let things take time to heal? 

Do I consult a doctor?

51,"SOS

I need help.
I am a 35 year old unemployed female struggling with extreme anxiety with paranoia and depression and c-ptsd. I had been seeking treatment via a doctor, therapist and a psychiatrist but I lost my job and health insurance and couldn’t afford the therapy anymore. This is a normal pattern in my life, but I have been unable to get another job. I think my history of my mental illness affecting my work has stained my career as an executive assistant- and even if it was something I wanted to pursue I don’t think I could anymore. 

I grew up in divided between a physically and emotionally abusive home and a sexually and mentally abusive one. I did not start seeking treatment until my mental health began to take a toll on my physical health and I was diagnosed with stage 3 hypertension at the age of 30. I have lost a lot of jobs due to my anxiety and paranoia. Despite that, I am very good at what I do. I usually get promoted and given more and more responsibilities, but after a while it’s like something happens and I snap. I start becoming paranoid that my boss and others are out to get me into trouble and that they all hate me. My anxiety grows and grows - even with therapy. It’s inevitable because I know I act anxious at work which makes people at work react differently to me which feeds my paranoia that there’s something happening. I get this small rock in the pit of my stomach that grows and grows - it’s feels like something bad is about to happen - like I am about to get caught or get into trouble. 

I try to stay at work but working as an executive assistant isn’t a job that’s easy to hide your anxiety. I have to be able to focus and - it’s hard not to read into a CEOs tone or something. And then be wracked with anxiety while trying to work - which results in sloppy jobs. This is definitely not work conducive to managing anxiety. Especially since most executives are very particular and do not leave much room for error. I usually do good at containing and hiding my anxiety for a little while. Then something sets it off and I find myself afraid to leave my house, afraid to go into public places, afraid to speak with anyone I don’t feel is safe. It starts becoming even worse when I become afraid to take a shower by myself. Or when I hide in my room when my boyfriend or sister have people come over. I am plagued my physical ailments that cause me to lock myself in my house. 

So I started trying to work from home. Which I enjoyed at first and only because I got lucky and found a job that wasn’t a scam. Unfortunately, the lawyer wasn’t financially able to keep an assistant. Since then I haven’t had any luck finding legitimate work. I seem to only get responses from scams. 

I’ve now started applying for in person office jobs, even though my stomach screams at me. I feel anxious just at the thought of working in that environment. Feeling like people are trying to get me into trouble or blaming me for things I didn’t do. It’s too easy to get stuck in my own head. I’ve gotten a few call backs but after that initial call, I don’t hear back. This makes me think that one of my jobs is speaking poorly of me- the ones I’ve lost were aware of my mental health. What if they are disclosing that information? Either way, I think my job loss has finally caught up with me getting new employment. 

Is there any employment help for people with mental illness? Is low income disability my only option to a steady but meager income? And without health insurance, how do I even go about doing that? 

My anxiety has been so crippling that I am having trouble doing anything. I feel very low and all I want to do is lay under the covers and go to sleep. I have been having very negative thoughts lately about my existence. I am either lashing out or hiding from the people I love the most. 

I just want to sleep until all the bad goes away and everything is figured out. Talking to people requires too much effort, especially those who don’t know me. And when it’s not, it’s usually for nothing - the words I choose never seem to really illustrate what I feel. I’m having trouble feeling like all of this is worth these constant knots 

 I feel like I am asking everyone around me for help, but no one understands what I am saying- no matter how many different ways I try to say it. I need help. Please help if you can, even if it is to just point me in the right direction.",24Sep2019,3
52,"The main problem was that I clung way too hard for someone, thinking that it would somehow keep me calm. It was dumb, and it delayed my progression significantly. It also likely was part of what ended our friendship. That I couldn't just back off and move on. But I've been so much better since July.

The friends I DO have, I get the chance to hang out with every day on campus. And I'd say it's even better now that I can focus on being with them. I first met them literally THE DAY after being at my ex's school. Safe to say my mind was kinda split. But now I can focus on them, support them. They give the same in return and I love it.

I've also gotten much more involved in campus athletics. I act as the sports director for our radio station and have loved every minute of it. Even if driving to the games is a pain in the ass. I still love what I do. Casting games is fun, being able to connect with all the athletics guys and gals is fun. Simply put, I'm enjoying the shit out of it.

53,"I’m not sure exactly when it started, but it gets worst as time goes on. I am happy but I always feel like somethings off deep in me. like I have a sadness that wants to come out. I can literally burst into tears at any moment. It hits worst when I’m alone. I get a sadness that overwhelms me and I just feel the need to cry. Waking up for school in the morning is probably the hardest thing in my day. Sometimes, I can sleep the whole day, others I can’t stay asleep for more than 30 minutes. I wake up with so much body pain and sadness. I remember there was a week where I would just wake up and look at myself in the mirror then cry and feel terrible about myself. When it comes to school I’ve been a honor roll student but this year it takes so much in me just to do the minimal effort. I still love going out with friends and sharing laughs but that feels like the only thing that makes me truly happy in the moment. Sometimes I think about is living worth it.

54,"So I’ve had a Problem with food since I was a little boy and I eat when I’m in emotional distress and have been overweight for a long time. My father has had problems with me being like this since forever and he is over controlling; he won’t let me go to college outside of the town he lives in, he checks my room regularly and does not respect my privacy and his girlfriend is also a b***h towards me. 

I’ve been sad constantly and I don’t care about anything anymore, I don’t care for anyone or any thing, and tonight the problems became worse. 

My father has anger issues and he arrived from a trip with his girlfriend and he saw I had gained some weight so he made me go on a scale and when he saw my weight he became mad, he told me I’m worthless, I’m a piece of trash, that I should kill myself and he started throwing things at me and throwing punches which luckily I didn’t get hit by. The thing is this has happened for a while and I don’t know what to do I’m not old enough to get a job to support myself and I’m desperate as all of his family supports him against me and they treat me like s**t.

We were together for a while and then broke up, and ever since we broke up, I start shaking when we text.

This was 7 or 8 months ago, I have a new girlfriend now and i've completely moved on. but 70% of the time it still happens? Just the shaking though, not much else.   
I'll be laughing about something or giving them advice on their new relationships or I'll be COMPLETELY fine mentally but for some reason I'll still start shaking still and sometimes my heart still drops when I see the little notification from their username.

58,"I think I feel emotions sometimes, but now I'm not entirely sure. The last time I cried was over a year ago, and I don't know if it was genuine or not. My dad is a pyschopath, I know that for a fact, so could I just be imitating him or did he somehow pass it on to me genetically? I light small fires for some reason, it just relaxes me. I could never hurt an animal, but I remember I did as a child, and that really disgusts me now. I have never wanted to hurt a person but I don't know if that will change in the future, hopefully not. I love my mom with all my heart but sometimes I hurt her feelings on purpose and I don't feel bad about it until she does something nice to me.

61,"so my friend asked me to watch around the apartments while he was gone since he got a job that has him out of town alot.  

I have a bit of a crush on him and I think I subconsciously been trying to come between them. I've telling myself that I was just helping a friend, but I betrayed my best friend (his woman) to try and be with him. I wanted my roomie back and I wanted the chance of maybe having something with him. 

Tonight they both cut me off and I suddenly realized what I been doing. it's the same shit that I've done to every guy. I go from not caring at all to being blindly infatuated. 

I sent a long message to this friend in my moment of clarity but I know it probably sounded like bullshit because I was denying everything moments before. I dont know what's wrong with me. I feel like when it comes to relationships, I'm still a teenager or something. I dont know. 

It doesn't help that I've been on a starvation diet lately because I'm broke and I've been on the edge of a mental breakdown from all the yelling for my best friend. 

I'm really hoping that I can fix things but I dont know. Maybe I dont deserve friends or an S/O. maybe I deserve to be alone, but I'd like to think that I'm a good person in everyway. I've gotten sober in the last month. I've gotten on top of my chores and I take care of a dog, a cat, and her 6 kittens.

62,"My partner of almost 3 years has been suffering from psychosis for the past 6 months now, and a bit of important backstory to him, he smokes weed every single day, does MDMA once or twice a month, acid once a month, he felt suicidal in late 2018 before showing signs of psychosis halfway this year, and his father committed suicide last year. 

(Note: He will not stop doing drugs no matter who tells him to stop, he is very stubborn and does not believe the drugs have anything to do with his situation in particular.)

Basically he believes a group of people have signed him up to a ""rapist punishment programme"", which in his mind is a programme designed to torture rapists by giving them psychosis and/or schizophrenia through something he calls a ""hypnotism"", which give the group of people full control over the subjects' thoughts and putting false memories into their head. He is not a rapist, but part of his narrative on how he received this ""hypnotism"" was that his teacher from school signed him up for it after she apparently caught him in class, masturbating to his cousin from across the classroom. (Which is a false memory, he doesn't know this though) for the next 6 months, he suffers from hearing lies being said to him in his head, and many stories of what he's apparently done in his past, or his mind telling him what disgusting things people have done. He says that he is a good person and hasn't violated anyone or done anything horribly bad to anyone in his life, and he believes this ""punishment"" is unfair for him but that is why he will find it easy to end his life, because he never deserved the torture in his mind. He feels really sorry for himself sometimes, and says that there are so many evil people in the world, then why did ""they"" have to target him, and why haven't they stopped if they knew that he's innocent.

He was admitted through to a mental health unit last month, in August. But upon hearing that the psychologist saying that he has psychosis, he began to lie his way out of the facility, still believing that people are controlling his brain, and that his thoughts aren't from psychosis. He asked me and his mum to keep quiet about the truth of his story, even though the doctors had it all on record. He didn't want to be in the mental health unit, and he was administered there for 5 days, if we said anything about the hypnotism, he'd be there for another 14 days. He dreaded it, so that's why he asked us to help him get him out of there. We felt bad for him, he didn't feel like he belonged there. I stayed with him throughout those 5 days at the unit, I pretty much lived there with him, and we talked about the details of his hypnotism, it was very detailed, I almost began to believe it myself, but it did have a lot of plot holes. I had to believe in his narrative so he could trust me, I genuinely wanted to support him throughout it all, but it was getting increasingly difficult to keep playing into his story that his mind has made up. I felt like absolute shit for telling him I believed his story. It was too farfetched. But I couldn't bare watching him be in a mental health unit for longer than 5 days, nor could I bare watching his mind suffer, I didn't know what to do at this moment. I could feel how much he was hurting while going through all of this.

When the 5 days were up and he was allowed to leave, only because he had begun closing himself off from the questions that the psychologist was asking, he lied and said that he was fine, and they ruled it out as a drug induced sorta psychosis, I'm guessing, because he had weed, MDMA and acid in his system before being administered into the unit. 

For about a month since, he'd been quiet on his experience with what he believed was the ""hypnosis"", until last week, he told me it gets worse everyday, and that ""they"" made it so that no one would believe him when he tried to get help for the hypnosis. He said he has no choice but to commit suicide because that's the only way to get them to leave him alone after 6 months. I protested every single time, and he told me that nothing I could do, could change his mind. And that he'd stop seeing me so that I wouldn't be involved in his death, out of care for me. 

Last week, he told me Sunday the 22nd would be the last time we see each other and that I couldn't change his mind. Sunday came, and we had been together all weekend, he was acting like his normal self, very sweet, being very lovable, even more lovable than he usually is. We went to a party on Friday night and saw some friends we haven't seen in a while, at first he didn't want to go because ""they"" wouldn't leave him alone, causing him to not be in the moment and truly have a good time. But he eventually ended up coming, saying that ""it will be the last time I will see most of the boys"". He revealed to me on Monday night that, while at the party, the hypnotists were trying to tell him that one of the guys there raped his little sister. Horrifying and completely untrue. 

We also made plans to hang out on Monday, in my mind I thought ""yes, he's forgotten that he wants to stop seeing me on Sunday, maybe he might've changed his mind"", Monday came and he messages me telling me that he doesn't want to see me. Said that he's bad for me, and that he doesn't want me to be involved in his suicide. He picked me up from the train station like he promised the night before, but as we got to his home, he asked me to pack up all my things, and that he didn't want to talk about it. I cried and tried to talk to him about it, only to get rejected and taken home, a couple hours later however, he wanted to meet up, we hung out together in the car in our neighbourhood for an hour, I tried to convince him not to leave me before trying to kill himself, he told me that nothing I say will change his mind. We talked like normal though, we laughed, talked, I cried, and he just looks off into space, telling me that he doesn't want to kill himself, but he has no choice, because the ""hypnotism"" won't stop. We embrace, and say to each other that we love each other a lot. After an hour, he drops me off home, he is calm and collected, and kisses me a couple times goodbye, and later messages me telling me that we're not to message each other, and it really was the last time we'd ever see each other. Responds to my ""I love you"" with an ""I love you too"", and says ""goodnight"".

The next morning I call our country's (NZ) early psychosis intervention team, I am fucking shaking at this point, I woke up every 2 hours the night before to check if he had been online on Facebook, and that I'd stop checking once I assumed he got to work, around 6am, I sent a text to his mum telling him the situation. The intervention team visited him at his work, and he messages me, furious, asking me what the fuck I said, and if I don't tell him now, he'll never forgive me. I told him the truth, that I was concerned about him and his suicidal tendencies. He tells me that this is the last time we'd ever speak, that I broke his trust for the last time, and that we'd never be together ever again, and there would be no more interactions between us, before blocking me on Facebook. 

I saw this exact reaction coming and I feel like shit, but I can't help but think that I did something wrong. He trusted me with the most sensitive information, and I alerted the team about it, I fear he will truly never talk to me or trust me again after what I had done. I was just so afraid that he'd choose death over trying. After about an hour or two, he unblocks me, is still mad, telling me that I'm a dumb bitch and the people who hypnotised him wanted him to be in the hospital, (but he told me they wanted him to kill himself, so I'm extra confused and scared), he insults me and tells me I've just gotten him the wrong help and that taking anti-psychotics will not help his ""hypnotism"" go away. ""You probably won't believe this since I've said this to you so much but we end now because you broke my trust for the last time. I will never forgive you."" I haven't seen him since last night, and I feel awful for trying to get help for him. Part of me knows it might be his anger or psychosis talking, but he is a very intelligent person who still thinks relatively fairly even when going through this, I can't help but think that doing this to him has ruined my lovelife and friendship with him forever. I feel like I've fucked up.

**TL;DR** I call the Early Psychosis Intervention Team on my suicidal boyfriend. He has been suffering from untreated psychosis for 6 months and smokes weed practically everyday, believes a group of powerful people w powerful technology control his thoughts and give him false memories.   
He's been taken to hospital and has to take anti-psychotic medication, he is deemed safe to go home but may have to reside at the hospital later on, depending on how safe they feel he is.   
My boyfriend hates me now and says he'll never forgive me for breaking his trust. He says that we'll never be together again after this, and I've made his life worse.   
I feel like absolute shit and feel like I have done him wrong. I'm not sure what to else I could've done. I love him more than anything and I didn't mean to make him angry with me. Am I wrong for what I did?",24Sep2019,3
63,"I am a single mom that has no form of financial help. I have to pay a lot of bills and deal with my everyday anxiety. I feel stressed and eating makes me nauseous. Every night when I hit my bed; If I don’t sleep fast enough it wounds up being a crying sesh. I’m tired of living. It’s hard to say because I have a son. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel miserable. I’m tired of crying, I’m tired of everyone hearing me be sad. I’m tired of it all. This has been my worst year and I don’t know if I can beat another.

64,"I've tried on countless occasions to write out exactly how I'm feeling, what I think might be wrong with me, and any general thoughts. This post will likely contain a lot of this, but much like those writings, it likely won't give a perfect portrayal, even when I go back and read it later.

I often struggle with not knowing what I really think and general confusion, and sometimes opinions or assessments are forced out in my writing as an attempt to feel definitive for once. Even as I'm writing that, I'm doubting myself. Do I really think that? Are thoughts supposed to be this omniscient and abstract? Why are people so capable of forming opinions or knowing so much about a topic when I can barely remember what I'm thinking? I hate feeling like an idiot in conversations because I can't contribute anything useful. It's hard to tell if it's just a lack of confidence or if I'm genuinely ignorant.

I've never been very social, as I was typically bullied in elementary school. Though it's hard to say whether my ADHD and general oddness led to my social difficulties, which then led to me being picked on, or if it was the other way around and became cyclical. Despite being bullied, I desperately tried making friends, primarily with the bullies themselves. Why? I'm not entirely sure, but it could be because they were popular and I really wanted to be liked. My trouble with making friends was not helped when I was tranfered to a new school for scoring high on a placement test. I didn't know many kids as most of them came from other schools, and of course their cliques had been well-established for years. My attempts to join in a group weren't immediate failures, but my conversation skills were nonexistent, and I simply did not know how to talk to people and contribute to a discussion. I became the kind of kid that wouldn't eat lunch in the cafeteria. Instead, I would either sit down the hall sometimes intentionally looking sad as a natural plea for someone to help me or realize that I was not in a good place, or I would eat with the teachers. I feel like they knew something was wrong with me, but nobody ever made any significant attempts to ask me what was wrong beyond ""are you alright?"" My body language often signalled that I needed help, but I also would say that I was fine or I would give a believable reason for not wanting to eat with the other kids. One day on the ride home on the bus, I was sitting on the edge of their social circle in the back of the bus, as I usually did. Sometimes they would address me directly, most likely sarcastically asking me a question so they could laugh at the answer. This time around, one of them turned and pointed at me with a smirk on his face saying ""look at Grant trying to be part of the conversation,"" which was quickly followed up by a group laugh. Embarrassed, I slid to the window side of the seat and slouched down, looking purposefully depressed out at the dreary rain. The entirety of elementary school was a horrible time of my life. No extended periods of happiness, no desire to learn. I would go to the nurse almost every day saying that I had a stomach or head ache and ask for my mom to pick me up. Some of my teachers would raise their voices at me in front of the whole class if I didn't do my homework, which I usually didn't. Even if they asked me what was wrong, I don't think I really knew what to say because there were so many factors at play. I was so inept with making friends, bullied, unmotivated, incredibly depressed, severely anxious, insecure, I had trouble focusing, and had trouble learning.

Towards the end of 6th grade and primarily in middle school, I decided that I did not need any friends. I would focus on school and not let social meanderings impede my aspirations which actually arose for the first time during chemistry class. For the first time I think in my entire educational career I was a dedicated student that wasn't failing because I was depressed and anxious and lacked motivation. My grades were actually great. But underneath this guise of success there was a growing resentment for other kids. I didn't really respect them and felt like I was smarter and more responsible. Having friends was meaningless when compared to school, I thought, and my ego built up and up and up. It was this mindset that I believe set me up for disaster in the following years.

High school orientation was an exciting time for me. I finally felt happy and was actively pursuing a field of interest with a plan for the future. I kept telling myself that I was going to excel in the coming years with the same mindset. It was in early October of freshman year when it finally hit me. The initial crack in my psyche that led to the bursting of the wall that I built up around me. I actually had started studying psychology and philosophy earlier that year. I challenged myself with the biggest questions, and I even declared myself an atheist, just not openly. I felt I was just as smart as any adult. I was the embodiment of logical thinking, or so I thought. It was also around this time that I gained a more intimate interest in sex and those sorts of things, and for the sake of this subreddit I will only say that, due to some mismeasurement, I set my confidence up for failure.

Everything came crashing down at once one day. I was in the middle of last period and this seemingly harmless thought struck me. Being the self proclaimed logician that I was, I braved the thought train. It was about trend. A trend of gradual and cyclical failures that I had every year with making friends. And grades. And everything. I literally could not think clearly and I distinctly remember intensely clouded thoughts. I could not handle it, and I broke inside that day. I clung to my psychology and philosophy studies in an attempt to fix what had happened, but it only led to over analysis and misguided thinking. Insecurity. Self-doubt. Worthlessness. Literally everything that I thought, and had built my happiness around, was completely false. My grades dropped tremendously. All I could tell myself for the next few years was that I'll never be back to the way I was. There were actually many ups and downs in hopefulness, but ultimately I am where I am now. Not much better, unfortunately. Or that's how it feels at least.

I never developed good study habits. Aside from those two years, I was never dedicated to bettering myself. I had become complacent and in doing so was left in the dust. Nowadays it's hard to say if I'm happy or sad, generally speaking. I notice so many issues with me that stem from earlier in my life, and therein lies the intention I had with writing this. I want to identify what's wrong with me, definitively. I don't want to speculate anymore and tell myself that I'm fine and moving in a good direction. (Another part of my mind is cutting in to say that there is a part of me that wants to be better and another that wants to just keep going as is and hope that everything turns out fine.) I am so incredibly insecure and I feel depressed and anxious every day. I want so badly to be the best at something, everything if possible, maybe to return to my former glory, so to speak. But sometimes I tell myself that it's too late, you wasted your life and missed your chance to be one of the best. You're not good enough now. You're behind everyone else and you should just give up college now and forget about your life.

I don't have to be the best, I know that, it's okay to not be the best and to even be average or below. My thoughts on this vary from characteristic to characteristic, but I don't know if it's really true. I try to tell myself that it is, but I don't really feel like it is to me. I don't feel okay being worse at something than someone else. I feel horrible around people that are better than me. I'm so damn envious and desperate and lazy and ambitious (sometimes in the wrong ways).

To some degree, I've left behind my desire to be the ""biggest"" and the associated feelings of inadequacy. I know I can't change it (even though I'm slightly above average), yet I still feel insecure quite often. It's actually one of the most significant parts of my emotional problems. Thinking about it just ruins my day.

I feel so awful around people who are smarter or know more than me, and no matter how much I tell myself that it doesnt matter, IT STILL MATTERS TO ME. And yet I do nothing about it. I just sit there and let it happen. They get smarter and I learn whatever is being taught in the class, most of the time. It's so often that I feel like a lost cause and worthless because of how far behind I am in every aspect. It really feels like I'm never going to be happy for more than a couple hours at a time. 

Now, to clarify, my opinions or the way that I present my issues could vary drastically from day to day. I may find tomorrow that I omitted large parts from this, specifically regarding more recent issues, or I presented something in an overly dramatic way. I overanalyze this stuff all the time and I worry so much about what people think, and I try to validate myself with the dumbest things. Sometimes things that I can't go into detail with on here.

I don't want to be this bundle of thoughts with no meaning anymore.


If you actually read all of that, I congratulate and thank you, it means a lot. It's late and I'm tired, and I'm aware of the poor way in which this was written, so I may revise or add to this tomorrow. If you have any input or help, aside from the obvious ""see a therapist,"" I'd appreciate to hear it. I know I need serious therapy, but I don't want to go in there not knowing what to say. I often need to write things instead of saying them. If they ask me questions, I need time to think about it deeply, otherwise I may give them an answer that misrepresents what I actually think. So anyways, that's enough for one night. Thank you.",24Sep2019,2
65,"I will keep it short. so over the past 2 years i consistently lost all my friends, and got dumped really harshly in a short-term relationship (4-5 months.). My peers usually avoid me (in work and class situations) and this leads me to believe my looks puts people off.   
For the past year I just went to work, and came home, or go to school, and come home. I cannot even pretend be happy around others anymore. I feel like they are all intensely judging me for my appearance. I have had my 'friends' in the past also make fun of me due to my appearance.

68,"One year ago yesterday my sister had to give birth to her 20 week old twin girls and watch them die , while this happened she got embryonic fluid on the blood and went into cardiac arrest and almost died.i flew home to be by her side she woke up the next day thankfully with no brain damage or other issues . 
The shock of the whole event meant I never grieved for my twin nieces and just went on living my life , in fact to hide the pain I over worked myself and ended up getting burn out .

Since this event it has felt like I can’t catch a break, a colleague committed suicide shortly after and another younger than me was diagnosed with breast cancer . Both affected me heavily .

I’ve struggled with work in the last couple of months and gone through rounds of anxiety where I can’t see anything going right and stress about everything fucking up or having no future . 

Then my aunt died a couple months after and last week my cat of ten years got a blood clot and we had to put her down .

All year I’ve tried my hardest to keep on trucking , to never let these things get on top of me and I feel worn and exhausted and like life won’t give me a break .
I know I can’t control these things but I’m not coping well and I feel my spirit starting to break . Today I just felt angry and passed off and that’s not me and who I am .

69,"My father would never go see a mental health professional so please help me. I think he exhibits a lot of Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms. I've spent my whole life trying to understand him but I need an outside perspective.

-My dad is very good at lying and can lie as easily as he draws breath. He can whip up a story on the fly, with such ease. He'll make you believe it, too.
-He tends to blame his failures on others and refuses to take responsibility for shit he does. When you call him out on something he did, he pretends to not know what you're talking about and makes you think that you're crazy and literally tells you that you need to go see a psychiatrist. Is this some form of gaslighting?
-99% of the time he's incapable of apologizing.
-He's promiscuous.
-He owes people a lot of money because he's one of those assholes who doesn't pay back what he borrows. He refuses to pay debts such as medical bills or parking tickets as well.
-He can be charming and funny and I'm sad when I see this part of him because I know it won't last, as he's very quick to anger (even at insignificant bullshit that you would never think would cause one to get angry) and will even call me horrible names that you wouldn't think a father would tell his child. For example, he's told me ""fuck you motherfucker"" called me an SOB, or in Spanish will call me a fucking bastard, a fucking bitch, a bastard bitch, a dog, a mare bitch, ""daughter of your whore mother,"" etc. He praises me when he speaks highly of me to other people, bragging that I graduated college (he had nothing to do with my education) but when he's angry, he'll call me an imbecile and that I have the brain of an ant.
-Whenever I tell him I have an interview for a job or back when I wanted to join the military, instead of raising my spirits and telling me that I could do it like my mom does, instead he put me down and told me that I'm not good enough, I'm not going to make it, that I lack the discipline or willpower to do x,y, and z.
-He's unable to see his own faults or admit them. He's perfect, yet the poor baby is always the victim of circumstances. Other people do things to him.
-He gets violent when he drinks, not that he needs an excuse.
-He has unstable relationships whether they be with family, romantic or friendships. His romantic relationships are either very short-lived, or if they last long enough, usually devolve into domestic violence on his part. He's also unstable in the sense that he has had so many vehicles, so many jobs, so many girlfriends or one-night stands, so many apartments because he moves from place to place. Especially when he was with my mom, he never lasted in a town for more than 3 months. It seemed as if he was running away from something. He never had things like furniture or electronics (or just things in general) for more than a few months because he would either break it in his fits of rage, or he would leave it all behind when he decided to suddenly move. Very odd. He doesn't seem to value things. The moment something ceases to be useful (or even if it's useful) he discards it easily.
-He sees the world in black or white.
-He doesn't understand why people can't be more like him, since he is a model human.
-He tends to exaggerate or embellish.
-He needs to be in control.
-He can turn on the water works on the fly and be quite histrionic.
-He's a cheat.
-He's manipulative af.
-He's needy af. If you go one day without calling him, the next time you speak to him, he is short with you. He feels like you don't love him, he feels like he's abandoned. His insecurity leads him to believe that if you don't pay him attention constantly, it means that you think you're better than him. No one ignores him and gets away with it! You should've seen the scene he caused at a store a couple of years back because I decided to go off on my own to the candle section. He legit began to scream at me near the entrance of the store as I walked by pretending not to know this lunatic. He does not give a single fuck if people stare or point at him. Speaking of which…
-He won't hesitate to make a scene in public or humiliate a (or argue with a) stranger. It's as if he's missing the ability to feel embarrassment. For example, if he wants to go return something like at the Walmart return center, he will actually skip the line and go directly to the cashier even if the person is busy with a customer. His entitled ass will stand there and slap the counter with his hand or snap his fingers to get the cashier's attention telling him/her that they need to serve him immediately.
-I have observed him steal at the store or he will even open something and eat it as he's walking around and not pay for it. Just a real classy dude.
-He thinks women fall into 2 categories: Virgin Mary or Mary Magdalene.
-He accuses others of what he is guilty of himself. (grammar? lol)
-He was abusive to my mom (not to me, though at 5 years old instead of being happy when he would come home from truck driving, I was terrified because I witnessed how he treated my mom) which is why we ran away. He used to throw the food she made on the floor and scream at her to clean the mess. He didn't respect her boundaries, there was no telling him no if you know what I mean. He fabricated scenarios in his mind that were driven by his jealousy. For example, my mom told me about one time before I was born, she was asking a cashier at a store about something and when they went back to the car he began to drive very erratically which scared her. He then proceeded to scream at her that she was a whore, that where did she know that male cashier from, was he her lover? ""What, do you think I'm stupid!? No bitch is going to make me look like a fool!"" He was driving very fast and she was terrified and she was too scared to talk back as usual, and he got angry at her silence. He then angrily grabbed her glasses off her face and threw them out the window and in the process he grazed her eye hard enough to cause her a black eye.

My mom never talked back out of fear which only angered him because he would then scream at her ""what, you think you're better than me? Answer me! No fucking bitch is going to ignore me!"" Another time, my mom was having very bad stomach pain and she only found relief by laying on the floor. (She didn't know how to drive and he refused to teach her or let her work so she didn't have money, and he didn't ""believe"" in going to the doctor because they just want money🙄) That night, she decided to sleep on the floor and you would think, oh no big deal. A normal person would be like I hope you feel better, good night. Nope. He got angry at her of course, accused her of ignoring him and thinking she was better than him, so he proceeded to get up to go kick her in her stomach.

When they would go to sleep, he would put his heavy leg on her that way he could feel her whenever she got up to go to the bathroom and he wouldn't fall asleep until she came back to bed. He ignored her repeated requests to stop doing that. When he was angry and they were either in bed, or watching a movie (that he of course chose) or eating, she had to ask him for permission to go to the bathroom. If she wanted to call her parents or if they called, he had to speak to them first and then hand over the phone to her, and he was always present during her phone calls. He was the chief censor so of course if she wrote home, or received mail, it had to pass by through his hands. She was not to visit the neighbor who was her friend without him present or without permission, she was not to open the door without permission especially if he wasn't home, she was not to use the phone without permission like I said not even to talk to her family, otherwise poor her when the phone bill came which he scrutinized (this was in the late 80s early 90s). She was also forbidden to look out the window. One time she was looking out through the blinds and he flew into a rage. Who was she looking at, was she looking for her lover? He always accused her, as he still does in general, of what he was guilty of doing. Random bitches he was fucking that week would always call the house, but my mom was the unfaithful slut here. My mom didn't care because she never loved him but that's another story.

My mom took me when I was 5 years old and we ran away. He refused to pay the $127/mo for child support (even though he earned a very good living, but my mom couldn't prove it to the judge because he got paid in cash because of course he doesn't want to pay taxes) to punish my mom for leaving. As a result, she had to work 2 or 3 jobs. He blames her of course. He accuses her of hiding me from him and that's why he never visited me. He never answered my letters or he was too busy to talk on the phone. I was a little kid who missed and loved my daddy. He of course flips that on me, blaming me that I was never available or that I never called him. I remember I was 8, and I wrote to him asking for money to buy a pink raincoat I saw at Walmart. He did write back saying that ""next week"" he would send me money. He never did. When he made promises, they were always to be fulfilled a ""next week"" that never came.

Anyway, he managed to find another poor lady (this time with a younger daughter from a previous marriage) and had a kid with her. My half sister told me that he treated them badly as well. She's all fucked up thanks to him and even accused him of sexual abuse. She says he began when she was around 9 and it lasted until her mom left him as well when my sister was around 13. I was 5 when we left him, but I wonder if we had stayed and grew up with him, would he have done the same to me? I shudder to think...
He's a crazy motherfucker. My sister told me that during their fights, one way that he would get her mom to stop screaming or talking back was by grabbing my sister by the hair and holding her as he flicked on a lighter next to her face. He would tell the lady to stfu or else he would set my sister on fire. She was in elementary when he would do this, and she's traumatized to this day. Neither she nor her sister speak to him. Why would they? He of course acts as if he doesn't understand why and that he was a perfect father who gave them everything, and that they are shitty ungrateful children who ignore him. He says that karma will take care of them. Hmph.

Well, dear readers, karma is certainly taking care of this scoundrel.

I know this is very long so thank you for reading. What are your opinions? I have way too much to write but this is long enough. Just what the hell is wrong with him? I have always wanted nothing more than to have a normal father. I want to know what that's like and I'm sad and resentful that I never got what I was looking for…what I'm still looking for now at nearly 30 years old 😥 Yes, I still talk to him &amp; I'm aware of everything that I've said but I find it very hard to just drop him. I don't have the heart to do so. Besides me, he's utterly alone. I know he deserves it and he has made his own bed,  but if I cut him out of my life, I would feel very guilty even though I have done nothing to warrant that emotion.

76,"Hi everyone, I'd be really grateful for anyone who reads and responds to this post, as I really need advice or reassuring words, or something, anything. Sorry if this post is a mess.

I've been in a really unstable position for a few months now. When I was 14 ish for a few years, I think I was really sad all the time and maybe had suicidal thoughts if you could call it that. But it kind of stopped for a while, and the last half of my sophomore year and first half of my junior year was smooth sailing and I think I forgot I had that problem.

However,  I guess something triggered something really bad in my brain somehow the spring of my junior year (2019). I watched a documentary with a mention of suicide and, from then on, I got the worst emotional instability I've ever had in my life. For ~3 days after I watched that, I felt some intense almost unbearable depression, and for the first time, my suicidal thoughts seemed so real and an option; it really really scared me. I knew that it was actually serious and that I needed therapy for sure. From then on, until the end of summer, even though I didn't feel something *as* intense, I still was depressed a lot of the time and had some really bad emotional lows. I even had some times when I felt so much self hatred and just straight up insane levels of instability and I don't know how to deal with it. I think I had a panic attack during the night when I was thinking about this--the lack of my coping methods and control over my intense emotions and the fear that it's all going to spiral out of control eventually--which I calmed down from by hugging a pillow and counting down from 100.

I do have some coping skills or whatever. I've read some posts on suicide and etc, and I have a document with links to supportive things /comments/videos I've found/collected throughout the years. But I still am scared that I can't handle this myself. I've told my parents, or at least my dad, and I asked to see a therapist, but he refused and said it was because I didn't sleep well enough, exercise well enough, etc...

So here's my plan: I'm definitely going to see some free campus therapist when I'm in college. I'll take medication if necessary. I'm starting to exercise now. I'm going to continue to try to reinforce a more positive mindset even if my mind eventually violently rejects it. I'll continue to do well in school and join hobbies I like, hopefully. I'm not in a bad place right now (referring to these few weeks), but I'm scared--you see, was my recent instability just a blip in normal-ness, or is it the start of a lot of instability and mental health issues? Can someone who's been through this please help shed some light onto this? Is this something that lasts for a long time and is never truly 100% ""resolved"", or are extreme emotional lows and dangerous thoughts more of a one time-ish thing? I don't ever want to die, I know that but sometimes I'm scared I'm going to be convinced when I'm in a low place...

This...is the smallest of my worries, but I really dislike how this instability has limited my life. A guy I really like and I mutually confessed, but of course I have to stop myself from dating him since I'm in such a unstable place right now and I can't do that to myself and I can't let him go through that...I just don't like how I have to limit my experiences because of this wretched situation.

To anyone who's read this whole thing, thanks for going through that mess, and any thoughts/advice would be so so appreciated.

Both days. 
And I came in crying the second day.

My head is swimming, the brain zaps hit me hard enough that I cant stay upright sometimes, and I constantly feel like I'm on a boat afloat some seriously turbulent waters.

But we're doing it! I'm hanging in here and we're getting through it! If you're taking this medication(or the off-brand like me, we don't have alllll that money) I can say it's been a godsend in the last four years of my life helping me stay healthy, safe, and sane while struggling with severe depression and anxiety. 

Have you ever swam in the ocean for hours, and come out all sunburnt and tired and sat down and you can still feel the oceans waves rocking you back and forth? I've been feeling that way for days now, and I'm tired, so I'm going to go to sleep. I wish you all the best, and know you've got the strength to get the help you need.",24Sep2019,1
79,"I've been wondering this a lot lately, and I find it to be an empowering question to consider on my worst days. Living as if my own happiness is sort of an afterthought is helpful in destigmatizing my depression and relieves the self-imposed pressure to be internally happy. What do you think?",24Sep2019,1
80,"Recently every mental issue I have has been flaring up, along with a few new ones. I've been laughing for no reason, I have these multiple hour long stretches where I'm terrified that there's someone in my house, I have this constant whispering just quiet enough that I can't quite make out what they're saying, I see people in the edges of my vision and hear footsteps and breathing, I have panic attacks almost constantly. I can't think straight and everything seems terrifying. I can hardly leave my house to do anything. It's all made so much worse by my family's complete dismissal of the notion that anything serious could be happening. I have an appointment with a therapist soon but I don't know what I can do until then. Any advice anyone can give would be much appreciated, I'm at my wit's end at this point.",24Sep2019,1

83,"I've noticed that I've been regularly having dreams where my life is on the line. One dream a few nights ago I had one where I was kidnapped. I remember feeling scared out of my mind in the dream. I was held in my friends house but by an elderly couple. In the dream the elderly man would throw stuff at me and abuse me. The woman wasn't nice, but she wasn't cruel. It was really weird. I remember sending sos messages in my dream and no one replied to them. I felt like I was fighting for my life and I was willing to do whatever it took to make it out of the situation alive. Another dream was I woke up in a locked room with a girl. I didn't know who she was but we were both confused as to what was going on. In the dream I walked up to the locked door and overheard male voices that were talking about what they were going to do to us. They said that they owned us and that they would kill us. I somehow made it out of the room and started sneaking around what I can only describe as a compound/school. People found me and were going to kill me and then I woke up from the dream. I've had multiple dreams about being raped. I haven't been raped. I was molested repeatedly when I was younger but never full on rape. One dream in particular I remember walking through a hotel and going to the bathroom. Out of nowhere a guy comes out and grabs me. I was terrified. It felt real. The fear was there, I swear I could everything. It was so surreal. Then I woke up and realized it didn't actually happen. Why do I have dreams like this? Especially so free?",24Sep2019,1
84,"I’ve suffered from depression my whole life. Over the years I’ve lost everyone whom I was friends with and I genuinely do mean everyone. I don’t open up to many people but every single time that I do, they leave me. I’ve lost all motivation and nothing makes me happy anymore.
   
2 weeks ago the love of my life (and I do not use that term lightly) told me she didn’t love me anymore and cut off all contact. I just don’t know what to do anymore because she was my one and only form of support. She’s been my only friend that’s stayed for roughly 3 years, and has been my girlfriend for the last 5 months. She changed my life. I had never felt happy with anyone before I met her. When she said those words to me I felt what was left of my heart shrivel up and die inside of me.
   
I’ve been in my room alone for the past 2 weeks and I’ve only eaten twice. I’ve spent most of my time sleeping and uncontrollably melting down to the point where I end up passing out. It all feels surreal, like this is all a horribly twisted nightmare that I wouldn’t even wish upon my worst enemy. I’ve tried to commit suicide 2 times in the past but never have I hurt as much as I do right now. I’m in unbearable physical and mental pain and I’ve tried everything from various therapists and meds to just trying to focus on myself or working out. Nothing has ever worked for me.

I’m making this post because I’m terribly desperate at this point and don’t know where else to go. I know about the suicide hotline but they  just say the same things over and over that you’ve heard a thousand times already. Is there some way I can get her back... Or should I just try to end my own life for certain",24Sep2019,5
85,My psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar and I am currently taking Lamotrigine. I am having second thoughts... like what if he is wrong? What if I have something that nobody knows exists? My head is so clouded that it is hard sometimes to see reality and I just went through a hard time after being told I’m bipolar that I actually just don’t want to believe it. I always say “I was TOLD I have bipolar” (I have amazing friends)... but I just can’t bring myself to think that is it... I feel like my mentality has been cornered into thinking I have a popular disorder.. it just seems wrong.. maybe I AM wrong.. idk.. is this normal after being diagnosed ?,24Sep2019,1
86,"I remember a time where regardless of what happened, I had a deep sense of inner peace with the beauty that was myself. I'm a lifelong artist and I always felt that whatever it was inside of me that enabled me to create was something outside of myself, like a superpower granted to me from beyond the material world. I felt that I had an ""other self"" which was responsible for all of the good within me, and when I interfaced with this entity, I would never be alone, never be uncertain, always be loved. 

In 2015, I became chronically ill with a condition that made me feel like I was suffocating on a regular basis. It created immense amounts of stress and anxiety and made it nearly impossible for me to relax. I became perpetually exhausted and suffered from severe insomnia. Doctors failed to help for several years and I am still suffering from these symptoms today. 

With these symptoms came a fundamental change in my psychology. I lost my sense of security and intellect. I lost my ability to concentrate and think on a high level. My art slowly screeched to a halt. I lost connection with my other self, and I became painfully lonely. 

My wife didn't properly support me during these times and I suffered from ongoing physical and verbal abuse due to her undiagnosed borderline personality disorder. My parents had a history of neglect and were not involved in my life. My family also excluded me from gatherings due to conflicts with my wife. My old college friends had all become distant and I was ashamed of presenting myself to them in my pitiful state. I dove heavily into nerd media as a coping mechanism and became incredibly pathetic. I embraced the identity of ""sick person"" and my MO became retreat-retreat-retreat. 

When I found I could retreat no further and became truly desperate, I decided to break my silence and reach out to someone I knew for support. I felt I needed someone to understand what I was going through, be on my side, and fight with me in order to continue living. The person I contacted I had previously went above and beyond for as a friend, and I believed they valued me. I asked for permission to open up and warned it would be heavy, and they agreed. Shortly after I told my story, they ghosted me. 

I didn't understand what was happening at first, why they were ignoring me. I kept contacting them, trying to understand and work out where the problem lied, and reconcile, but they continually ignored me. After awhile they blocked me on everything. When I made one last attempt to reach out, basically saying that I was sorry, they called the police on me, sharing all of the personal information I had given them, and I was told any further attempts would be considered harassment. 

This incident taught me to hate myself, that I was apparently repulsive, and didn't deserve to be treated with the basic respect of a human being.  It made me go from just being miserable to being overtly suicidal. 

I soon after reached out to my then ""best friend"" who had also grown distant. He had been in the military and it fucked him up. I had done all kinds of things for him throughout the years, as we've known each other since childhood. He was having problems financially and with mental health, and I stepped up big time to try to help him out. When I explained what was happening to me, he ghosted me too. I couldn't believe it was happening and kept assuming it was a mistake, he was busy, I don't know. I think I tried to contact him 10x over the course of a month until I finally realized my friend wasn't coming for me. I never heard from him again, no explanation no nothing. Even when I told him explicitly I was close to killing myself, he wouldn't lift a finger. This was August 2018.

I got divorced a few months later. I cared about my wife, but couldn't love her romantically. We operated a business together and planned to continue cooperating, but she met a new guy and abandoned her duties altogether on short notice. I've had to run everything myself since then, and due to my mental and physical health issues I'm not well equipped to handle it. Due to her BPD, she also wrote a narrative in her head that all these years I've been some kind of abuser, manipulator, and villain. Its the drama triangle in action. I went from rescuer to persecutor once new guy entered the picture, and she can't identify with any role other than victim. 

I had two romantic interests since then. They both became close friends, and both rejected me for other guys. Both subsequently ghosted me as well. 

When I count them up, 5 separate people abandoned me over the past year or so. Each one was different, but each devastated me and caused horrible pain. The message ingrained in my mind is that how I feel and what I think doesn't matter. I'm a disposable person, and once I lose my utility people will discard me. No one fights for me. No one has my back, truly. I can't care about myself because of these events. I've been to therapy, support groups, I've come a long way with self help and recovery but I'm still in so much pain. I'm damaged and I see no means to undo it. These events, the sickness, the stress, the divorce, the ghostings, the rejections, they've caused a certain trauma I think. I miss the days when I used to be able to love myself.",24Sep2019,1
87,"Basically what the title says. How do I cope with things before being able to see a therapist?

My insurance needs to be approved then I’ll be able to seek help w/ anxiety and depression, but playing a waiting game hurts pretty badly. Just wanna be okay already.",24Sep2019,1
88,"When I say that I can't ""feel"" the point, I mean that, logically, I can see what the point is. Life, work, family – those things are important, but I can't mentally register the importance. I just don't have the drive, the motivation to do well and I don't know what to do. Because even if I really don't care, it frustrates me to no end because everybody else expects me to care.",24Sep2019,3
89,"Hi, I am a 35 yrs old male, I have a history of sexual abuse when I was an adolescent, and I have been through therapy with many counselors &amp; psychologists. As the title states, I have what I would call definite cycles which seem to hinge on sexuality and sexual acts. 

This cycle goes from 'normal' (i.e. enjoy regular sex, not wound up)  to ---&gt; anxiety, depression, dread, some psychosis; I also get sexually extreme with myself, some self inflicted physical pain, feelings of transexuality, sometimes cross dressing, homosexuality, desire for extreme sex acts, especially the most degrading kinds. 

Then one day I wake up, and I think, *""What the fuck have I been doing to myself?!?""*

All this began when I was 13. I had been repeatedly raped by two men for close to a year, and when we moved, the rape ended. I was molested multiple times afterwards, and in hindsight I was just allowing it to happen because I was so submissive and weak. 

Anyways, I feel completely out of control when I am like this and I am in the midst of one as I type this. I have been feeling hyper-sexual, and to my credit I think I don't fuck around anymore, I just abuse myself and nobody knows and I feel like such total POS when I look at myself in the mirror. I have to go out in the world to see family, buy groceries, whatever, and I am walking with the real physical pain of what I did to myself last night, and other side effects, and I am just trying to appear 'normal'. 

I also hallucinate and I although I have seen a psychotherapist about it, I have never followed through with figuring that all out. I just live with shadow people all around me, sometimes bugs or mice, sometimes animals in the forest. 

I do have to say that the fact I am cognizant of these symptoms is good, I think, one of my counselors said that was a good sign. I worry about losing control, because I cannot stop myself sexually abusing my own body, I worry that one day I will just lose touch with reality and get commited involuntarily.

Speaking of involuntarily, I have been having a lot of very intrusive thoughts that cause me to involuntarily say 'NO', or 'STOP', or hum, snap my fingers, stutter-blab the same word for like a minute, just make stupid noises...I have it under wraps right now, it has been close a couple times but I just said I was talking to my dogs. 

I don't know what the hell more counseling would do, because I was doing all this *during treatment*, I even told them straight up what I was doing, no change in the cycle,; although I do have a ton of coping mechanisms &amp; 'mental tools' I have learned from years of treatment. 

Thanks for reading, I am fine.",24Sep2019,1
90,"Before I get started I haven’t thought of a way to end my life, no plans, no real desire to kill myself, I just can’t find a logical reason to stay alive. I flunked out of college because I lack the self control and drive to stay in/go to class and actually pass and not waste mine and my parents money. In the last six years I’ve had roughly 9 jobs because I let my lack of desire for the job build up until I walk out over pretty petty stuff. I don’t have any real desires or enjoyment in activities other than video games and my two favorites I’m barely mediocre at so I feel like it would be a waste of time to try and stream or go to tournaments to make an actual living off of them. I have the opportunity to go back to school but I have zero idea what to do with my life because I find very little joy in anything. And as far as relationships go, thanks to one girl in my class and the rumors she spread about me at the small town school I grew up in, I couldn’t get an actual girlfriend for the entirety of grade school and so out in the real world I have zero experience with girls and coupled with my lack of desire to put my personal baggage on anybody, because nobody deserves to deal with it, that aspect of life is basically null and void. I have really close friends but I feel like I can’t bring this to them because there really is no actual way to help me out of this rut on top of the fact that they are all in fact moving forward with their lives and frankly don’t have the time to be helping me with mine.

91,"So Uh. Before getting into this, I'll straight up say I'm a diagnosed schizophrenic. So I Totally understand if this is me just being, you know, that. 

Anyway, like. I guess I just needed to talk about it? And I suppose ASK if this is normal. I basically made this account to ask this...

So anyways. The past few nights I've been really struggling to get to sleep. And it wasn't for say, any usual reasoning I'd have. Say, being stressed out or something. It was for this super, damn specific reason. I couldn't really put it into words before it happened again? But it's happening now. 

I have been up, all, damn night, just. Thinking this one thing. Not like words or anything but this. Feeling? Feeling like something is just wrong. And I realised it was specifically about my BED of all things. I lay down in it and it just did not feel like it was mine? It doesn't feel safe. It feels like I'm somewhere I do not belong. It just feels like something is off about my bed specifically. No matter how hard I try, I can't get comfortable, because it feels like I'm unwelcome here. 

The second I'm off of my bed, I'm fine. But, I lay down on it, and I just totally feel like somethings telling me (It feels way, way more malicious than this awfully typed dialogue) ""Hey, dude, You're not welcome to sleep here, so this is gonna feel REAL bad!"" 

And, I don't know how to explain this part, but it's not just a mental feeling. It's physical too. Like I feel like something is just not allowing me to lay here without feeling physically and emotionally uncomfortable. Like I seriously feel like sleeping here is going to do something. Good or bad? I don't know! Probably bad, but who's to say.

Things really haven't been going well lately, and by lately I mean for the past month or two. He's making almost no effort to change things that detriment our relationship and I'm sure he's taking my affection for granted.

I really do love him but the relationship is taking its toll on me and I want to leave it, but there's a problem.

My boyfriend has schizophrenia.

He relies on me to hold himself together and if we don't talk for a while he starts to hear voices and has even hallucinated before. I took a break for four days once and he almost killed himself.

My boyfriend is from a poor family in America, so he can't afford therapy, since he has to pay for his meds.

97,"(Sorry for the financial drivel, this is a cross post. I still need advice though)

Hey everyone,

27 YO, married, two kids ( 2YO and 1MO) and my wife is on maternity leave.

I suffer from pretty severe depression and anxiety. I did try CBT and medication exactly a year ago but it didn't help, the pills certainly worsened everything. Now coping with cannabis. Not sure if I can get it legally.

Anyways, I've been pretty much feigning competence at work for the last 3-4 years. Okay maybe that's me being self depreciating. I do know what I'm doing but I feel a sense of impostor syndrome all the time, I work in IT. 

Currently on a salary of 25k in Canary Wharf, and I'm planning to move out of my current residence in Stratford. Willing to relocate if needed.

I'm sorry for this explosion of info, just wanted to give a solid background.

Right now, I feel like I'm about to explode. I'm really starting to feel the anxiety become unbearable. I really want to leave work and find proper help this time, as last time I was working FT and using weekend therapy services. But I feel I can't. 

I have tried applying to the government for help, but during their arbitrary assessment, they deemed me perfectly fit to work. The assessment nurse literally had said suck it up, you have kids, no time to focus on yourself fully. I'm a 'man' and should just tough it out and seek part time help. I mean if they can reject my disabled friends application for income support...I have no choice.

Which I kinda get. My kids mean the world to me. They are the single only thing keeping me going.

So here I am. What the frick do I do? I don't want to leave work, the government pretty much told me to bugger off. I'm just sitting in my bed, had to tell my boss I feel too mentally unwell to come in.

I'm so lost. I am so, so hopeless right now.

I can’t stand being alone with my thoughts at times like this. Then I try to sleep but in bed I have these premonitions of my inevitable death and I get really scared thinking of the cold, brutal reality of dying and it makes it hard to sleep. Years ago I used to get this really bad so I would stay up all night as I was afraid of going to bed.

I indulge in overeating to make myself feel better and/or looking at porn for hours. In the past I would visit prostitutes which was very expensive. I also impulse buy things and so I’m in a lot of debt that has accumulated over the years.

It’s not as bad as it used to be but I still feel so broken. I alienate people with my emotional ups and downs by being too needy and pathetic. I just feel like I have no one to talk to, because if i talk to my partner she will leave me and if i talk to my work colleagues I’ll be ostracised and my friends literally just don’t care because that’s how it goes when you get older.

At work sometimes I snap angrily at people who are rude to me and they understandably reject me. I get filled with rage at people being assholes. So then I become unemployed for a while and get depressed and my debt increases again.

They told me I was going to beautiful, as though they had seen whatever future lay ahead of me, and I, naïve as I was, believed them. I trusted that by the time I was sixteen, I would be perfect. I wished for sensual feminine curves, paired with the grown-up version of the rosy, childlike demeanor I was convinced I had.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I wish I never grew up.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was eleven, I had suddenly ballooned up. Nobody warned us of the other changes that would occur during puberty—they only told us that breasts would just magically sprout of our chests and we'd start bleeding out of an orifice we never even knew existed. We were never told about weight gain, or sudden cravings, or acne. I started binge-eating—I'd take snacks to my room after my mom had gone to bed, and stuff the wrappers in a handbag I kept in my closet. Over the course of a year, I had gained 26 pounds. I was no longer the wide-eyed child that was looked upon with affection, I was suddenly the girl who wore the same size of clothes as her mom. Of course, the bullying started. It hurt so much back then. I felt embarrassed for feeling pretty, and, being religious back then, started to wonder if I was being punished for being egoistic. My cousins started pointing out the fact that I had gotten ugly, the boy I liked was suddenly grossed out by me, and the loving gazes stopped coming. The only thing that was constant was the fact that I was a smart kid.

&amp;#x200B;

Come junior high school, I continued to gain weight. I was overweight, and I started getting acne all over my face. I couldn't care  less about my calorie intake, or washing my face, so my state continued to worsen. When I got braces at thirteen, I was told I had an underbite. Now I understood why I was told I had a moon-shaped face—my lower jaw jutted forward, my chin was aligned with my upper lip. Living in a country with, frankly, less-than-competent orthodontists, my braces couldn't fix my underbite. I was 5'0, weighed 140 pounds, and had an underbite. I suddenly understood why nobody liked me romantically—I was ugly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had all sorts of blemishes on my oddly-shaped face, my hair was a constant mess, and I was fat. I started becoming more extroverted as a strange way of coping. I forced a ""loud"" personality to make up for the fact that I was less than attractive, but I always took a step back when I realized that I wasn't comfortable being that kind of person. For a while, I was glad just being the way I was—sure, I wasn't much to look at, but my grades were good, and my friendships were alright. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I actually turned sixteen. One day I woke up and realized that, half a life ago, I envisioned myself as someone beautiful. I looked at the mirror and that wasn't what I saw. I started picking at minor details—my skin was bumpy, my nose was dotted with blackheads, there were acne scars on my chin that just wouldn't go away. Then, it got worse—I didn't like my feet, I didn't like my knees. My armpits were too dark, my bellybutton too deep, my lips too small. I used to look at my face with a twisted sense of satisfaction, now all I felt was sadness. I started skipping meals to restrict my food intake, only to binge afterwards. The cycle continued. My friendships got worse, my grades started to decline. My relationship with my mom started getting bad. I started cutting myself—my thighs were constant targets. I couldn't possibly wear anything long-sleeved in this country.

&amp;#x200B;

On my seventeenth birthday, I had to celebrate it alone, in a coffee shop where my only company was a tired-looking barista and a sweaty, middle-aged jogger reading the morning papers. I convinced myself I was happy. I was not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm eighteen. A decade after I first started thinking about how beautiful I'd be in my teenage years, a lot of things have remained unchanged—I continue to read voraciously, and there are times when I still want to be left alone. The difference is that people have now substituted the word ""pretty"" for ""smart"". Don't get me wrong, I appreciate being called smart, and I love my college major with an all-consuming passion, but it's, well, different. If anything, my obsession with my flaws has worsened. I once had an uncle approach me and tell me I had nothing left to me but my brains, and another walk up to me just to ask, ""How come you've gotten ugly after starting college?"" Those are the little remarks that eat at me. I feel bad for doing this, but I occasionally make subtle comments on my appearance, hoping that someone would retort and say, ""Oh no, you're not ugly!"" When someone doesn't, I feel terrible. When someone does, I think they're lying. Being called ""average"" is my temporary happy pill, hearing comments about my skin or body kills me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a bad relationship with food for a long time, but my disordered eating habits have actually taken effect this year. I went from weighing 144 pounds to 127, and this, to me, felt amazing. I knew I was killing myself slowly by starving myself to the point of exhaustion, but fuck did it feel satisfying. It never felt enough though. I now live in fear of a full, healthy meal, and I spend an abnormal amount of time looking at photographs of myself wondering why I've grown up so wrong. Recently, it's come to a point when I'd arrive at my dorm, see myself in the mirror, and just start crying. I'd catch my reflection in glass windows and my day would be over. Someone made a comment about my hair looking dead, so I cut it, and now people comment on how I look like someone's mom. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I surround myself with pretty things, secretly hoping that in doing so, I'd catch the pretty virus too. I started wearing makeup, but eventually stopped when someone joked about how it was terrible. I've received comments on how small my boobs were, or how flat my butt was, but the ones that put me through a lot were always the little remarks about my body weight. There are days when I feel embarrassed to be alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be beautiful again. I want people to look at me affectionately, and as selfish as this sounds, with a sense of envy. I want to be able to experience the thrill of romance at least once in my life. I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror and be happy—or at the very least, okay—with what I see. There are days when it's easier. There's something beautiful in the way my friends laugh over the smallest things, something so endearing in the way my dog licks my fingers to wake me up, and something so exciting about riding a bus with the windows rolled down on a Saturday morning. And yet it's always the brief moments of loneliness and vulnerability that just kill me inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to stop being so obsessed with my own flaws. I don't know why I find it easier to love and accept other people than it is to treat myself with the same amount of kindness and respect.",24Sep2019,2
101,"one thing I struggle with/have struggled with in my many experiences in needing a diagnosis is my family history of mental health issues. My biological father wasn't around from before I was even born, and I've never met him in my entire life; or so I thought - but that's a wild story for another time. My mother thinks he/his family never had MH issues, but they're both from Mexico (he still lives/lived there - mom says he's probably dead) and people don't talk about things like that. Last I knew, he quit medical school to pursue a career as a police officer who is active in corruption (cartel, etc - basically people you DON'T want to be associated with) and I've read everywhere that those are two prime career choices for people with personality disorders, especially sociopaths - so I've always wondered.

My mom claims ""she's perfect"" and even though she was halfway through medical school when she quit, and moved to Canada to have me (thank goodness; and something I'm always grateful for), somehow she doesn't believe mental health issues are real. She's recently resigned herself to saying ""she must have made me too smart"" and that's where my issues come from. ""She made my brain TOO GOOD"" so therefore...I have issues. Quote: I made sure to eat fish every day, multiple times a day so you'd be smart, I must have made you too smart. (she also thinks she gave mercury poisoning because of this.)

What I've come to notice, being around her again now as an adult, after 10 years...is I think she has some serious compulsions that she hides or thinks are normal, but is it worth it bringing up things I think I've noticed in my next hospital/diagnosis visit? 

She bleaches the dishes, thinks things NEED to be cleaned after X amount of days (example I made a giant batch of soup, being eaten over days, and it's been in the fridge in the metal pot with portions taken out and heated, but it NEEDED to be moved to something else to clean that pot after a certain amount of time 'because'), sprays FOOD with bleach, and overall thinks germs are going to get her. She thinks that essential oil diffusers are ""air purifiers"". She always thinks the neighbours are always listening to us/can hear us even inside the house and started to say something really weird starting the other week.

I've been very open with my current struggles with her, and fight to get her to believe them and have to use medicine and medical terms to get her to listen. She's started saying I need to ""learn magic""...that I must be magical and TOO POWERFUL but don't know how to ""use my powers"" and THAT is what is giving me MH issues....that we're from a ""family of witches"" and that my sister has even been trying to learn, but she's too weak, and that I must be some sort of uber powerful one who has no control over it.

Now, that does NOTHING to help my own personal delusions, especially my delusions of grandeur. My mind is looking to cling to anything that makes the mush of reality around me make sense, and this feels so easy.  

So, end venting, but is it worth telling my next psychiatrist my thoughts/observations (without any confirmations - and I'll make sure to be clear on that) about my mother...and that there may be an actual direct family history that has forever been ignored before?",24Sep2019,1

103,"I started seeing a therapist recently because I've been dealing with a lot of stress. I also recently went through a breakup that really messed me up. I felt like I need help dealing with all of it.

In my second appointment with my therapist she told me she thinks I'm incredibly anxious and she wanted to go through an anxiety questionnaire with me in my next appointment. So in my next appointment we went through a questionnaire that she claimed was about anxiety, but most of the questions were about how well I communicate with others, do I easily understand jokes and sarcasm, am I ever overwhelmed by certain smells/tastes/textures, and how much of a routine do I have and how much does it bother me if someone interrupts my routine. And many other things that were clearly about autism, not anxiety. I'm pretty sure I'm not autistic.

I honestly don't mind that she wanted to test me for autism, but it really upset me that she couldn't just tell me that she wanted to do that. I don't appreciate being lied to, especially by my therapist. 

And I've seen her a few times now, and I really haven't felt like she's been trying to help me cope with everything going on in my life. It seems more like she wants to slap a diagnosis on me as soon as possible. Even her receptionist has talked to be about how they need to get me a diagnosis.

107,"Hello friends.

I need some advice and some reassurance that I’m not alone.

Actual questions: 

- What is your experience with handling work while managing your mental health? 
- Have any of you gone on disability because of your mental health? 
- What did that process entail? 
- At what point / how did you determine that you could no longer work?
- how do you/did you cope with the negative self feelings that come along with this?

Story:

My work history is messy to put it nicely. Most places I worked at for only 4-6 months until I started working at the evil giant store where you can buy everything. I worked there for almost 4 years, moving departments and roles just about every 6 months. 

I’ve been working at a call center for the last 2.5 years. I promoted quickly into a salary trainer role and was doing okay until my facade crumbled and it became apparent that I had no idea what I was doing and I was failing miserably. I got into a fight with my boss, had a melt down in the HR office and stepped down from my position after 8 months.

They gave me a week off work during which I bleached and dyed my hair a neon color. When I returned they put me back at the lowest rank of call taker.

I’ve been back taking calls for 2 months.  I had my Pdoc fill out the paperwork for FMLA and I have been using it pretty frequently because I have been really struggling lately to go into work.

Either I wake up and start having anxiety attacks over having to go in or I’m too depressed, if I can actually manage to get to work and make it through part of my shift inevitably I’ll get screamed at by a customer over something I can’t control and it will put me in a mood and suddenly I’ll be in tears and a crumbling mess unable to get my shit together enough to resume working. 

I got an email today that the company that manages my FMLA is disputing it for the second time saying I use it too much. This caused me to have a breakdown at work. Luckily my partner works with me and we were able to take a break and go for a walk and I cried it out and was able to stay. 

Every day I work is a struggle. I’m looking for something part time instead of full time for now, I’m also looking into doing rideshare. 

I need guidance and words of wisdom.

116,"TL:DR - last August, I tried to end it after feeling I hit rock bottom. I now feel tremendous guilt on top of everything else. I genuinely don't know how I can cope with it. 

Full story:

After spending a couple of years stagnating in a minimum wage job, massive financial issues, and marital issues, I thought a new job would at least help the situation. 

I managed to get a new job last June, and it was going well... On the surface. Sure, I was earning slightly more money but that was being eaten up by travel... And the new hours and distance meant most days I left home before my children got our of bed and got home as they were going to bed. 

After a couple of months, it began to snowball... Things felt like they were getting so much worse. Our finances were taking a hit with the travelling I was doing, my relationship with my children was suffering and on top of it, the marital issues had gotten worse despite my efforts in trying to improve things. 

It was out 5 year anniversary in August, and a month or so before, i had said to my wife that i really don't want anything as i know we couldn't really afford it... I would just be happy with a card and her time so we can try and reconnect. 

Fast forward to the day and I get up slightly earlier, make breakfast for her and have a card and a rose ready for her - she didn't even acknowledge it. Not even a ""happy anniversary"" or a ""thank you"". To say it crushed what was left of my spirit was an understatement. It was the thing that pushed me over the edge.

I left for work after making sure I said goodbye to my children, and gave each of them the biggest cuddle I could manage - I knew I probably wasn't coming home. 

On the way to work there was a road that was national speed limit in a single carriageway - which in the UK is 60mph. 

The road was quiet. Almost too quiet. I took this opportunity and sped up a little over the speed limit and aimed to crash into a lamppost, hoping that'd do it. 

I somehow managed to swerve at the last minute avoiding it. Call it divine intervention, anxiety of dying or just cowardice, I didn't do it. 

I got to work and broke down, and was pretty much sent home to rest - I couldn't bring myself to explain what had just happened, so I made an excuse and said I wasn't well at all but couldn't afford time off, and luckily my manager was very understanding (and in hindsight, I think she knew something wasn't right).

I drive home and make it home after my wife had gone to work (at the time she worked 10-2), and broke down... Spending what seemed like forever balling my eyes out. My wife gets home with the children after doing the school run and sees me, asks why I'm home early and I make an excuse, saying I'm really not well. 

I think she picked up on it too, and asked me what's up... So I opened up and said I'm having a really tough time, and needed her. I didn't dare say that I nearly killed myself. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and things were getting better between us. I applied for new jobs to get closer to home and found one in the industry I loved, back in the finance industry. 

It paid slightly more and had no travelling, so that helped our finances a little bit.

But I felt tremendously guilty about what I nearly did.

Things were going so well. My wife and I had organised monthly date nights to spend time together, and had even thought of things we could do either on the cheap or free. 

My new job was going really well... In fact I had a meeting with my manager in January of this year, who said she's really pleased with my performance, and is looking at taking me off probation early. 

I got home that evening feeling so great. The best i had felt in years - but still had those feelings deep down, bubbling away.

The next day, i had a phone call from senior management. They had announced that they are closing several of our branches, and ours was one of them... And unfortunately, I would be made redundant in May. 

My whole world crashed around me, and I felt back at square one... But worse, I felt like I couldnt cope and coupled with the existing guilt I tried to get help and went to my doctors who said ""you'll get better but in the meantime try not to do anything stupid"". 

This made me feel worse - I felt alone. 

Fast forward to today, and I still feel suicidal. I spend most days holding back the tears knowing that I could be one bad day away. 

And I still have the guilt gnawing away at me, acting as a constant reminder.

The military(and I'm speaking mostly about the Marine Corps because that's what I know) promotes and forces an unhealthy lifestyle that is high stress, little reward, completely soul sucking and then spits you out with zero regard to your mental health as soon as they're done with you. 

I get it. They're government property technically, they sign their life away when they enlist, but goddamit they are still PEOPLE. I am sick and tired of these young people losing their lives and all the military does is ""promote suicide awareness"". Yeah, we're fucking aware they're killing themselves you dolts. I just cannot believe that this is happening so frequently and the military has taken zero responsiblity or action to ACTUALLY help these people who give their lives to these organizations. 

I am heartbroken and tired of seeing my husband, a big burly Marine veteran 
reduced to tears because *another* friend killed themself. This man who has had to try to keep himself afloat mentally himself because of the military, is left lonelier, sadder, and more confused every time this happens. 

What do I do? My generation's veterans are killing themselves off, and the military won't do anything. The VA, the thing we all pay for specifically to help these men and women, isn't doing anything.

I am mad. I am sad. I want solutions. I want accountability.",24Sep2019,46
123,"this is so long, i’m sorry!!!

i had a conversation with my mom about how i wanted to quit my job. for a bit of backstory, i only started my job about a week ago, and it’s my first food service job, which is difficult even for somebody without mental illness, but extra hard for me especially with my manager being misunderstanding about my learning of things. no need to go into detail about it, long story short, this job makes my mental illness worse and is definitely not helping with my depression and overall suicidal thinking. this job has definitely not helped with my wanting to kill myself (don’t worry about that, i am currently getting help &amp; am not a danger to myself!!)

i told my mom i wanted to quit this job and look for something not in food service because this job makes my mental illness worse. she told me to “stop making excuses”, then continued to tell me i need to be responsible and basically assuming that i was just going to no-call no-show instead of being professional and giving a two weeks notice. she’s also telling me to find a job before quitting this one, which i understand, but this job also literally puts my mental health at risk so i cannot stay here, especially if it takes as long to find a job as it did to find my current one. anyway, when she told me to “stop making excuses”, i got upset and told her i’m not making excuses and that my mental health matters and i need to look out for myself (something i have ALWAYS had a hard time coming to terms with). the call ended on a not very good note.

today she calls and starts talking about the job again, and she says “i know you got upset because i was telling you to be responsible” and i said “no, i was upset because you basically insinuated that my mental health is not important and that i was making excuses. which i wasn’t, this job makes me literally depressed.” and she replied “we all get depressed, no one likes working” and this is when i told her “no, mom, like i have depression. like i actually want to die.” i have never told her about my suicidal thinking before or even mentioned that i’ve wanted to die. and basically it just went downhill from there, where she IGNORED the fact that i essentially just told her i’m suicidal, and once again said i need to be responsible. i said “i don’t know why you always assume i’m going to do the worst possible solution” and she replied “you did that when you worked at this store [3 years ago]”.

note: i worked at [store] when i was 16. it was my first job. i admit it, i was irresponsible and stupid, i didn’t know how to handle a job. but i am 19 now, i have maintained a 3.5 gpa, made the deans list at my university both of my first semesters, and have been working as hard as i can to both make my dream of being a vet tech come true as well as FINALLY get help for my various undiagnosed mental illnesses. i have also had two jobs between then and now and have always been professional. i like to say i have improved massively in 3 years.

i say to her that i was 16 and stupid back then and that i’ve changed, plus it didn’t help that she screamed at me for two hours for calling out, so i was afraid to tell them i was quitting. she says “well i wouldn’t have yelled at you if you were responsible.”

i’m getting angry and telling her that i know i was irresponsible back then but i’m 19 now and more mature than i was at 16. she tells me she doesn’t want to hear my attitude and says goodbye, and we hang up.

am i overreacting? i just think that, regardless of my actions back then, i’ve had two jobs since then and have been completely professional. and also, her ignoring my statement about actually wanting to die hurt me deeply. the first time she told me to stop making excuses, i cried for the rest of the night because i felt like she didn’t care about my emotions, and now i feel even worse because it’s like she doesn’t care that i’m having a hard time dealing with suicidal thoughts. i don’t know. please be honest with me, maybe i need a reality check.",24Sep2019,1

126,"As soon as all the hypes gone down people will be back to not caring about people who are struggling with mental health. Lol The cycle goes on. 


Posting the phone number of a suicide prevention line on your FB or sharing a ""mental health awareness"" post isnt ""doing your part"". It's just virtue signalling to make you think you're doing something good.


Anyone else remember anti-bullying week in high school? Wearing blue because ""love is louder""? All the popular kids rode that train and as soon as the week was up they were right back to their usual cruelty to people they thought less of.


As soon as all this hype is done, it'll be back to isolating the most vulnerable till someone else jumps. But keep sharing all those candle gifs and saying ""thoughts and prayers"". Works every time, right?


I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, high anxiety, and have almost jumped that bridge numerous times personally. Last time I almost jumped it was onto traffic below. I remember every time I've tried to off myself. ""It literally doesn't affect you"" some have told me. Yeah, but it does. People like me whose minds have been through hell and back, who almost tapped out early, we know that this public ""support"" will be short lived. It always is. We are more than use to being let down.


No matter how bright and wonderful things are, some urges don't go away. It's a chemical imbalance and sometimes meds make it even worse depending on the person.


While made in good spirits, their ""thoughts and prayers"" are a poor attempt to virtue signal to feel better about yourselves. As I said, as soon as this ""mental health awareness"" hype is over, the rest of the people here will just ignore and isolate those in need. Because it's easier to type kind words publicly and post candle gifs or even ""march"" than to actually reach out to someone.

127,"Ive become acutely agorophobic in the last month with my phobia of vomiting in public. The panic attacks kept me from going to college or work. Yesterday I was perscribed Klonopin which is a benzodiazapene just like Xanax. I was afraid it would make me feel drunk and forget things, I was afraid I would wake up in jail and not remember what happened because of the klonopin. I was VERY wrong. 
What aftually happened is I took a shower for the first time in days. I put on my makeup and cute clothes (I had previously worn a raggy tshirt and sweatpants for 3 days straight) and went on a 30 minute drive to see my best friend at her new home. I was able to walk around the supermarket with her and ride in her car without sweating and shaking because I anticipated to vomit. I didn’t have panic attacks.
Anyone out there who is hesitant to start taking benzos, please don’t be. I wouldn’t reccomend Xanax as its half-life is 3 hours, so you feel compelled to take like 4 doses a day. With Klonopin at least its twice a day.
My biggest fear was that I would become addicted. But then I thought, “Would I rather be on this medicine for the rest of my life and be able to function, or become increasingly agoraphobic until I can’t leave the house for years?” I’m sure you can guess which one I picked.
It’s no different than your antidepressant. Since you have to take it every day for the rest of your life you must be addicted, right? And since diabetics take insulin everyday, they must be addicted, right? Wrong. You NEED this medicine.  Just like other people need other medicines. Just because you take it every day doesn’t mean you’re addicted. It could simply be that you genuinely need it to function because of a chemical imbalance.
If anyone out there is struggling like me, I know it’s hard to get out of your house to see the psychiatrist, but you need to do it. It’s the first step to feeing better and getting help. Tell him everything, about any panic attacks or phobias, about how your anxiety boxes you in and constrains you from living a productive life. Tell him about any triggers. any circumstances that could be contributing. It was clear from what I told my own psychiatrist that I needed immediete relief anxiety medicine. I have work and school this week and need to be able to go. It only makes sense that he would give me Klonopin. I feel so much better.",24Sep2019,15
128,"“Learned helplessness happens when a person chooses to not get out of a negative situation because the past has taught him/her that he/she is helpless”

So, the way I interpret a negative event has an impact on whether or not I feel helpless? YES. So, lets infer that if I take a negative event, choose intrinsic negative beliefs about myself to describe why this event happened, and let these attributions pervade into other areas of my life. Would I then be more likely to let this helplessness turn into depression? Thats why we’re here.

Internal beliefs one holds that are “internal, stable, and global” lead onward into literally learning helplessness. When we blame ourselves instead of outside circumstances to a negative outcome (internalization), take this belief and let it pervade into our future (stabilization), and finally let this pervasiveness extend across multiple arenas of our lives (globalization), we have the fuel to the learned helplessness fire. These attributes, or factors that a person blames for the outcome of a situation (in this case negative situation), directly correlate as a reason for learning helplessness.

https://images.app.goo.gl/7ApSqswkG8tLY9ZD9

My question is, what is the opportunity cost to lingering in our learned helplessness? Do we sit comfortably in this learned helplessness and use it as a self-fulfilling prophecy to not move forward? † This trend is likely to increase unless we collectively take a progressive &amp; proactive approach towards individually living mindfully, fully aware of possible secondary benefits that harm our growth and progression due to learned helplessness.

Look up Martin Seligman’s Learned Helplessness; going balls deep into the particulars of the background to the theory is not why we’re here. Instead, I’m going to relate to how I unintentionally learned the benefits of helplessness in my life. What follows will be my best attempt to be vulnerable, because lord knows I struggle with this face-to-face, especially with people I don’t know, most likely with people like you.

It was a brisk day in Illinois on April 20, 2016 (4/20 yes). My brother and I each woke up around 3:30 AM that morning with a shock of anxiety riddling through our veins, preventing both of us from falling back to sleep. This is highly unusual for me at the time, but I tried my best to think nothing of it and drove to Tinley Park for my 7th day leading as a superintendent for my first project to renovate Hollywood Casino.

The micro-burst prolonged to generalized anxiety when the uneasiness feeling extended into the late morning. On my first break, I tensely walked to my truck to check my personal phone out of curiosity (carrying two phones is a pain in the ass, if you know…you know). A sobering walk led me to open my phone to see it exploding with text messages. Before I could open a message, my pops called with the traumatic news that my beloved mother had passed on.

Growing Up

When I look back at the person I believed myself to be while growing up, I see a happy guy that radiated positivity, which in turn bled out to those around me. I used to be a part of multiple social groups and took pride in uniting people together. Coupled with positiveness was my ambition to learn and grow.

I always looked to my mother for knowledge and my father for wisdom. From the time I was a child, I observed my mother’s never-ending desire to learn for her job and for leisure. My father’s unrelenting work ethic towards his profession and life in general was of course something I strive to emulate. As I’ve aged, I’ve grown to believe that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. However, as I sit here and analyze myself presently, I sense a considerable delta in these positive qualities from which I was before my mom passed and who I am today.

Relevance?

“The shell shock is real, &amp; no one can be ready” is an excerpt from the “Your Love” poem I wrote 36 hours after the phone call, with maybe 2 hours of sleep under my belt. Looking back, this statement proves to be true, and unfortunately I’ve chosen to let the initial shell shock extend three years and pervade into thinking I am helpless not only with changing the events that led to my mother’s passing, but also in my ability to comfortably be “me” again.

“Wait a second crazy, you’re you everyday,” the reader suggests. My response is this: in order for you to comfortably be yourself, you must be mindfully aware of the ability to ride the dichotomies between the positive and negative qualities you possess. Do your best to find middle ground between bridging the two qualities. Remember the old phrase, “don’t let you highs get too high, and lows get too low?” Well, I’ve been living in a constant state of valley lows, with a short embrace to maybe a diminutive, plateaued-mountain every now and again, along this depressed path for the last 3 and some change years later.

When you’re not yourself, you disregard dichotomies and are in default mode, idling on one side of the double-edged sword.
What changed? I took the “a burden whose scar runs so deep one will never be the same,” &amp; engrained it negatively into my life. Today I’m arguably a foggy reflection of the person I used to stand up for myself as being.

Back to Growing Up

From mimicking the positive qualities of both my mom and dad, as I grew up I quickly figured out I had the same burning fire inside that my mom had with gaining knowledge, and the same hustler’s ambition mindset of my father. I danced in these qualities before the passing of my mother, and let them lead me to success in education, profession, and socially. No matter how hard life got, I stuck to these qualities and they were always able to get me to the other side of whatever struggle I was dealing with at the time. However, since my mom went upstairs, these qualities have been passively flickering, barely holding onto their relevance in my life as a young man.

Why am I talking about this?

The phrase: “I’ll never be the same” is of itself regarded as a highly pervasive phrase. Mix this pervasiveness with negativity, and you have learned helplessness. This is the phrase that catapulted me into my depression, and the reason stems from learned helplessness.
What does learned helplessness feel like, and how did this lead you into depression?
I’ll speak for myself, and to me learned helplessness feels like comfortable misery. 

Being unable to change the events leading towards my mother’s death is something I’ve held onto since the phone call. This feeling that I can do absolutely nothing to bring her back and/or change her state of mind before passing I hope will gradually change into acceptance upon absorbing this learned helplessness theory.

The infectious way of thinking crept into my mind when I was most vulnerable, after my heart was broken from loosing the most important person to me in life. I adopted the philosophy of doing the bare minimum to get by, which in turn gradually changed my “upbeat, positive demeanor” into a negative and helpless SOB (no pun intended). The fire that was once ignited as a young boy burnt out by the time I developed into a young man.

The way I used to dance in the positive qualities in my DNA has been succumbed down by my learning helplessness, which I let pervade into the foundation of my thinking towards any effort I put forth in life.

Why would I waste my time reading and writing? Why would I hit this extra sales call? Why go work out? Nothing I do is relevant enough to make a difference.

WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT?!

These phrases quickly lead you, in this case me, into a dark pit of depression. But is there a happy ending?

The secondary gains of a lazy &amp; uninspired life has drawn me into researching why it is that I always feel (by the time you’re reading this, felt) like shit, and Martin Seligman you could be my angel. Upon finding his research, an light bulb went on in my head when reflecting upon the last three years I’ve lived. Moreover, its helped me realize that my mom would call me a total pussycat for the way I’ve “acted”, which is an extra driving force to “unlearn helplessness.”

This is my formal goodbye to my “learned” helplessness. I choose to sink 10 toes down back into the foundation of the person my mom raised me to be. Happy late birthday mom, I love you very much.

142,"[TLDR:: *I physically/sexually harm myself during PTSD episodes and I need outside perspective*]

Hi, obvious throwaway account here, even made a throwaway email, because frankly I live alone with these feelings and acts and am very ashamed of them. Firstly, I recognize that there are people who actively take part in much of what I discuss, and that makes it 'normal' so I shouldn't feel that ashamed; yet I do, and I think once you read this you will see there is more to it than just the act. 

So really quick personal history; I am 35yr old male, I identify as bisexual, and I was first raped as an 11 yr old boy, and that was commited by two adult men for about a year. I was molested and sexually assaulted by multiple adults &amp; teenagers until I was 19, when I began getting violent, as well as drinking and doing a lot of drugs. IMO, self medicating. I was court ordered to psychological treatment at age 20, and since then I have completed many years of psychotherapy and medicinal treatment voluntarily.

Clinically, I have severe PTSD; with associated symptoms of GAD, depression, involuntary/intrusive thoughts, self harm, some short periods of psychosis in the past, alcoholism and drug addiction. I do not use hard drugs or drink anymore, and have been free of that for about 7 years now. I do smoke marijuana as where I live it is a legal recreational drug, and I use it to help me sleep as well as for anxiety. I prefer marijuana for anxiety over pills as I don't feel like a zombie, my dick still gets hard, and I can function in society without appearing like a doped-up mental case (which pills did to me). 

So on to the meat of the post, I have cycles of sexual behavior which coincide with periods of increased PTSD symptoms. When these symptoms arise, I become very hyper-sexual, but only homosexually. During my teens and 20's when I would get like this, I would engage in a lot of unsafe gay sex, especially sex that was degrading or painful. I am very lucky that I came out of that unscathed, and yes I have been tested many times. Although I have dropped that lifestyle, I still engage in painful, self-harming, degrading, self-inflicted sex acts when I go through these periods.

I said in the title that I also get 'increased homosexuality'. I have been a part of the LGBT community &amp; legitimately romantically dated men, so I understanf that saying *'increased homosexuality'* may get some eye rolls. However, I am speaking clinically, so I am saying that my inner-sexuality goes from a very firm bisexual who enjoys normal, safe, romantic sex to feeling like I want to be violently gang raped &amp; pissed on in a back alley (analogy). Instead of following through with what is an absolutely unstoppable desire for unsafe gay sex, I stay at home and physically/sexually harm and abuse myself. 

Then one day I wake up and feel 'normal', and I look at myself in the mirror with disgust &amp; think, *""What the fuck did you do to yourself you sick freak?""*

Other considerations; my intrusive thoughts have been getting much more intense, and these cause me to 'jump' like I was scared, involuntarily say 'NO', or 'STOP, snap my fingers rapidly, hum off tune, sing, quickly mumble the same word for a minute or so, etc. I also have times where I hallucinate peripheral shadow people, bugs, mice, nighttime spectors, and very rarely audio hallucinations which sound like voices of people I know. With these increased symptoms around my PTSD episodes, I also become a clean freak, I *must* organize, and I start a lot of projects, which to my benefit a lot projects are interesting and beneficial to me so I roll with it and complete most even after symptoms go down. I am an artist, so most projects are art related and I feel really inspired by them. I have a very, very small following for my paintings and historical work, although I don't currently sell anything as I am building a gallery collection.

Also, by all outward measures I am a fully functioning, successful adult. I own a home, have a successful career, a car and truck, &amp; two doggies I adore. I am however, very introverted and keep to myself mostly. I believe my neighbors think I am a weird artsy queer, they may be right.

So if you made it all the way down here, thanks for hanging in there, you're a real trooper and I appreciate you for that. What I am seeking from this post is the kind of perspective only anonymous strangers can give. I don't expect any kind of 'clinical' response, though if I do that would be great. I would love to meet other ppl who share these issues and form some kind pen-pal relationship as I feel I really need that sounding board, if for anything just to gain some outside perspective as I feel so locked inside my own mind sometimes.

146,"This will always be a sensitive topic to talk about because we don’t want to upset/offend/trigger anyone. 

I think people will agree with me that there is a huge difference between being suicidal, thinking about it, wanting to do it versus actually doing it. Actually taking the steps to do it.
I had always had suicidal thoughts, but the night I decided to attempt it was very different from anytime that I thought about it. I have been broken many times before, but something different has to break inside of you to do it. It’s hard to describe to someone who’s never felt it; who’s never attempted to take their own life. 
Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m just an asshole because i feel this way.

I know that it’s selfish but I hate pretending that everything’s fine, when I’m in a bad place I hate having conversations and just being social and everyone expects that of you on your birthday. My boyfriend has not stopped talking about the gifts he’s bought for over two weeks now and I somewhat wish he’d just forgotten. 
I appreciate the people that love me but I can’t help but just want to be alone tomorrow; except I can’t have that because they would know somethings wrong of course.

152,"Had an emergency Dr appointment today. From the moment I saw her, never met this Dr before, I felt uncomfortable around her.

Immediately, she addressed an issue I wasn't there for today and was still trying to build up the courage to ask for help with - my eczema. (I was there for possible appendicitis/chest infection.) I have voiced concerns before about using prescription creams for it, especially steroids, since my dad reacted so badly to them when he was using them, resulting in long term health complications. Obviously, I'm very cautious about going down that route myself. Normally, my Dr would accept this and move on. This Dr didn't even listen, and put the prescription through without my consent. I don't even know at this point if I can afford to get it, as I'm going to have very little money left after my rent payment.

Anyway, I started freaking out after this. I've had bad experiences before from both abusive parents and bad DRs who wouldn't listen to my concerns. My usual Dr, and even the ones I usually see for emergency appointments are willing to listen and be patient. Not this one. She ignored me slowly freaking out and starting to have a flashback.

She tried to get me to stand up for a chest examination, but I didn't respond. I couldn't, I was stuck rapidly switching between the past and present. She ignored my boyfriend trying to tell her that I couldn't do anything right then. So, the Dr then just told me over and over again to get up and leave the room, because she didn't have the time for this.

I managed to say, over and over again, I couldn't move. My body was stuck, reacting to past trauma. But she wouldn't stop telling me to get up and leave. This is yet another trigger for me, since my abusive mum often told me to do something no matter how many times I told her I just couldn't. So, my body stopped breathing. Completely. For around a minute, I couldn't breathe in or out. It felt like longer. Once I took in a breath, I managed to stand up - literally having to cling to my boyfriend so I didn't end up curled up on the floor- and the Dr sat us down in the corridor, where everyone walked past.

I feel utterly humiliated, and have lost all trust in doctors again. It took a long time to be comfortable enough to go to them in the first place, and now I'm back to square one.",24Sep2019,1

I recently started working as an intake coordinator for a mental health facility, so I get a lot of calls from people seeking treatment. I was made aware when I started the job that we occasionally will get crisis calls, where people are in immediate danger either to themselves or to others.

About thirty minutes ago, I got a call from a man about his wife, who was threatening to hurt herself. I was trying to provide him with the crisis number for his county, not fully knowing how bad the situation was until I heard his wife screaming in the background about god and “how bad it hurt.” 

I advised him that if she needed more immediate help to call 911. He said he might have to and hung up. Overall, it’s still sitting with me. I know it’s still fresh in my mind but, suffering with mental health issues of my own, I have a tendency to fixate on things and get anxious.

As a child, I was bullied a lot for being weird and doing «funny» stuff to get attention, and i used to cry myself to sleep a lot because of that. I started contemplating and fantasizing about suicide and self harm in the 7-8th grade, and started self harming in the 9th grade. Around this time I had a friend call me many many mean things behind my back, and refuse to apologise. I started going to therapy, and then dropped out as i hated my therapist and felt i never got anything out of it. In the end i was put out of therapy with the diagnosis «light depressive episode». On top of this, I am trans, FtM. That’s my «story», simply put.

I have always been weird. This is not something I say just to get qUirKy points, i would give my heart and kidneys to be or feel normal. But it has not been possible. I have one friend, but i have been friends with her from the fifth grade, when making friends was easier. We meet maybe once a week. I also have a gf, who i meet most days. But at school it is a whole different story. I have no friends, I sit alone all the time, I am literally invisible. My class has a class snapchat group, and i was not invited. I am just so annoyed that i am unable to make friends! I do not know how to, and even if i try, it just doesn’t work. Everyone has friends. Even the people who say «hahaha i have no friends at all» typically have one or two people they trust and talk to alot. (yes i do have friends, but i do not trust her, nor my gf entirely) I just don’t feel like i’m able to have that. Even the shyest, silent people i know make friends in a second. Maybe i lack the skill to communicate with others. Sometimes it feels like I do not understand emotions at all, and it is tearing my relationship with my gf apart. I really really try, and she tries to teach me but it doesn’t work. I also have a lot of anxiety around speaking to other people.
I have never heard of anyone else who feels this way, and I just want some advice, cause it is getting way too lonely to feel like the only person on earth who is unable to make and maintain relationships. I don’t know why, and no i haven’t talked to my therapist about this, because we are currently attempting to get to the next steps in transitioning medically.

172,"(This got longer than I expected, did add a very condensed tl;dr at the bottom)

When thinking about self harming, the first thing that jumps to mind is cutting. On top of that, I can imagine that things like banging your head against the wall regularly as a form of punishing counts as well? That sort of thing?

The line is a bit vague to me.

I have always tried to be careful with putting labels on situations, because there is this threat of making things worse for yourself (or even unnecessary forms of self diagnosing). Also, it seems disrespectful to the people who are *actually* dealing with the kind of things some people just use as a light-hearted label.

I am currently being treated for GAD, with depressed feelings as wel as complex trauma/PTSD. Medication daily and therapy weekly. Lately I have been wondering if I should take this ""thing"" I do seriously.

When I feel myself get dissociated from myself, I pinch the skin on my hand between my nails. This has left marks for a couple of hours, not really that serious. I do a ""normal"" amount of clenching my teeth, squeezing wrists, scratching wounds open and stuff. But lately I've been doing something a bit weird?

I have been using tweezers to individually get rid of hairs on my lower left leg. Yea, idk either.

It hurts, especially on some places, but that hurt isn't necessarily meant as a ""punishment"", so I should be fine, right? If it's only to get some more feeling in my body, feeling more grounded and present, it can't be *that* bad of a thing. Just a bit weird, but I can live with that.

Maybe it IS a problem though, I really don't know at this point. Would it be fine by itself, but gets serious under certain circumstances? Am I just coping in an odd way?

I sort of jokingly told my therapist about this, and she thought that it's reasonable that at moments I get spaced out, I have an urge to make contact with my body again. Plus, it also releases dopamine and stuff, so as long as it doesn't feel like a ""need"", it isn't that much of a deal (except for the underlying reasoning I suppose).

Should I count this as self-harm? Tell my therapist again with a more serious tone, telling the little things added to it as well?

TL;DR ~ To get a bit more feeling in my body when in a zombie-mode, I use tweezers on my leg hair. Could this fall under a light form of self-harm, or is it just a weird habit?",24Sep2019,1

176,"ok.. i don’t know what just happened to me half an hour ago. i googled it (i know not the best but i thought it would help if i knew it was a panic attack) but now i’m confused. sorry for the long post but you need backstory. also i’m religious (it plays into this).

i was reading a (christian) book and this mini story had a person with the same name as me. when i read the name i had this super intense feeling in my chest/heart. like a burst of adrenaline maybe but it felt like an emotion but i don’t know what it felt like.. just an intense feeling. my heart started racing while i continued to read. every time i read my name i felt that weird intense feeling again along with my already racing pulse. i know sometimes people read books and see their name and get excited so i thought maybe it was that feeling magnified by 100?

i felt the urge to praise the Lord but to bow.. the second i bowed i was bawling my eyes out. i had a racing pulse and was bawling my eyes out for who knows what reason.

this continues on.. me curled up in a ball bawling my eyes out for no apparent reason until i just stop. when i stopped i felt weird. i stood up but didn’t feel anything. i would say i was calm but again.. i wasn’t feeling anything, just completely emotionless. i stared at my reflection and it wasn’t clicking that it was me. i was staring into my eyes like i was staring at a blank wall. i’ve disassociated before so i knew what this was. i walked around but didn’t feel myself, i felt light.. like a ghost walking around. my body was moving because that’s what it was supposed to do, not because i was moving it.

i heard a voice come from my left ear. i knew it wasnt an audible voice , it was in my head but it was weird. i only heard it on the left of me.. it was a male voice. it said my name a couple times. i knew it was in my head but it didn’t feel like it was FROM my head.. it wasn’t my voice and i couldn’t hold a thought at this point so i wasn’t consciously saying my name in a male voice. 

the whole time i was disassociating i felt scared.. what had just happened to me.. why was i feeling like this.. i felt a panic attack coming on but i was able to curb it. also .. i couldn’t hold a thought.. when i tried to think nothing came or stuck to my head and that freaked me out as well. i kept feeling that weird feeling in my heart and i was scared something was about to happen again.

immediately after this happened i wrote down what happened to me in case it was worse than i thought it was and if something were to happen to me people could read what happened up until i “passed” or whatever i thought would happen. i can post screenshots in case you wanna know what my mental state was like at that point. 

and now one last note. i’ve had panic attacks before so i thought.. oh i’m prone to them that’s what this is, but.. what triggered this? out of nowhere i just start bawling my eyes out and then disassociate.. now, i’m not sure how this works which is why i’m asking this because i don’t know if anyone else knows, but can undealt with trauma lead to a psychotic break? my mom died 5 months ago and i haven’t really dealt with it, i’ve ignored what has happened. could me bottling up my trauma result in a psychotic break and that’s what just happened to me?

sorry for any typos.. i can barely hold a thought and my feelings are slowly coming back.",24Sep2019,6
177,"I can deal with isolation, but I live a flat block full of strangers, I ended up here when I had work related stress issues from working 100 hours a week for 3 years. A lot of the residents here live alone and seem pretty isolated aswell. I can hear everything my neighbours do and you can hear there routine behaviours , behaviours where they aren't actually doing anything but what seems to be to break the monotony of isolation, like walking into a room opening a drawer and literally closing it without as soon as it's opened. Walking around  opening and closing doors. A few people I've met here seem depressed. For a while there seemed to be a lot of drugs , now you never hear anything, people will sit outside , pensioners mainly ,all day to socialise , I know a few people in the building mainly pensioners or middle aged, who I'll chat with on my way out of the building, when I first moved in we were talking about the residents, there opinion was that people are weird they just sit in those flats all day, they don't know how they do it.  Since moving here I moved away from everyone I knew and lost contact , but have been in and out of work since. My plan was not to move as it's cheap and instead of paying for a expensive property rental I would start saving for a mortgage and get back on track.

At first I thought the place was alright , and. Could get my head down work and save , very cramped spaces though, noisy environment, and the vibe is generally claustrophobic and like walking on egg shells because the neighbours seem to living the same way. I had saved a lot of money , but life happens and getting myself on the property ladder was becoming more and more of a challenge , I earned good money but the work was high stress, that coming home to this , the isolation and the claustrophobia. It's undermining my mental health and is making getting out of here more and more difficult. 

I have quit a job a few months ago as I'm having vision problems with my right cornea .

This level of isolation and stress is wrecking me , Its definitely starting to age me as the veins in my hands are popping out as apposed to a year or two ago.

Should have left this place long ago , now I feel as though it's too late my head's fucked",24Sep2019,3

There are days where I seem to over think every little thing, I can't switch off and it can spiral to a point where I feel really crappy about everything, sometimes it can make me feel depressed/apathetic towards a lot of things that I should care about. It can also really cloud my mind to a point where I feel like I can't remember anything or when I try to recall something my mind seems to block it out with loads of useless thoughts. There are days where it's like I get ahead of it, being able to block out those thoughts for some reason or another and honestly I feel like a different person, like everything flows and feels great, like I can do anything, then the next day comes and it's a lottery on which experience I get.

I was wondering if anyone else had this issue/any advice on dealing with this.

I get into these stages where when I’m around other people I try to act normal but I start feeling hella weird and then when I’m by myself I make faces to myself and stare in the mirror and feel like hurting myself. But it then goes away for a while and comes back. I’m keeping it at bay now but this always happens???

182,"TL/DR: Unstructured and unstable job is causing my Mental health to Deteriorate and it's killing me.


So, let me start off by giving some background.

I've been working for this company for the last 5 years. I worked with them all throughout college, and right when I graduated (this past May), they promoted me to this position that they just came up with a couple months back.

I knew this was going to be an adjustment. It's my first office and post college job. There's a lot to learn of course and I'm totally fine with working from the bottom up.

However, I'm getting to a point where I can't take it anymore. I'm just going to list off some reasons:

1. First week into the job, my boss, a guy I really wanted to work for, got promoted to an international position. It sucks he's gone, but of course I'm super happy for him.

2. The boss that took over after him didn't fully come into the position until almost the end of July (I got the the job in May), so that's a quite a decent chunk of time to have a new job and not have any structure?

3. The HR lady that Interviewed me and who I really enjoyed working with, and probably learned the most from, just got promoted and is no longer working in the office either

4. My ""coworker"" is both passive aggressive and aggressive towards me at the same time if that makes any sense? She treats me like I'm her subordinate and even when she talks about things that aren't work related, it feels like an adult talking down to a kid (i.e. ""when you finally live on your own and get your own car insurance, you'll finally understand how expensive everything is) ((I've been living on my own for five years...)) 

5. The position I have is kind of bogus. It seems like they can't decide whether I'm just a secretary and should handle all the odds and ends of the office (which is 100% okay) or if I'm this weird Recruiter/HR/Compliance person, which would also be okay. But I can't do both. I literally don't have the time to do both jobs.

6. I'm hourly and I can only work 40 hours a week and can't hit OT. Which I didn't think would be an issue at all, and I can't believe I'm complaining about it. But I can't possibly get everything done in the week that they put on my plate. I probably actually do work more than 40 hours but just forget to put the time in for it because I'm stressed about meeting deadlines.


These are just some of the bigger issues, there's been more. But I don't want to ramble. I've been applying for other jobs because I mentally can't handle this anymore. It's a high stress and low reward job. I guess I'm just looking to vent, but if anyone has any advice for me while I'm stuck at this job (because I'm not going to quit unless I have another job lined up), then please share with me. All of my friends and family have noted how tired and spaced out I always seem. I just want to feel somewhat normal again",24Sep2019,1

And you know what? It IS real art work. It brings me joy. And if that's bothering you, it's a you-problem, not a me-problem. You don't get to decide whether what I'm creating is valuable or not.

She's having panic attacks in class and such. Of course she talks to me about it. Which I am very grateful for, of course. I'm glad she trusts me.
However, and I'm sorry if I sound like an asshole, but it's taking a huge toll on me. My depression and anxiety are now getting worse. I'm having mental breakdowns basically every night. I hurt myself like I used to. Everything overwhelms me. I cry way too easily. I dread going to school because I'm terrified that she's going to have another panic attack. Everything is just too much to handle and I don't know what to do anymore.
Whenever I try to talk about the issues I'm having to her, she just gets mad or says ""I'm not doing this right now."" Plus, my social anxiety prevents me from talking to anyone besides her, so I'm basically alone. I'm just overloading and so, so emotionally tired.

To the point where it affected my sex life... a teenager that wasn’t able to get up cause stress..

186,"Warning: this post discusses child abuse. 

Hi everyone, sorry I don’t know if this is a place to get advice for things like this but I honestly don’t know where to go at this point. 

Basically there’s this video that went viral recently of a man beating his very young child - reports claim she was 3 years old but she looked TINY like she was 1. 

I’ve already warned my family and friends that I cannot handle watching brutal content especially towards children because it makes me more or less hysterical. Unfortunately this was everywhere and got sent to me on WhatsApp. I’ve deleted it from my phone and it’s been four days now but I can’t stop freaking out about it. 

Luckily the man was arrested as a result of the video and the children (the girl and her 3 siblings) are reported to be in protective custody. 

I haven’t slept properly since I saw it, I have a physical reaction every time I even just think about it (my heart rate goes way up and I feel like my blood is on fire or something, and I start shaking). I am incessantly checking the news to see if there has been any update about the kids. 

It’s even started to slightly affect my work. My mind was so focused on this whole case that I felt like I needed to get out of the office, so I just walked out, completely forgetting that I had a deadline to meet for a bit of work that I had already completed and was just sitting in my computer. I got it done, but it was an hour past the deadline (very unlike me and my boss was a bit miffed). 

I’m trying to move on but I feel like I’ve become obsessed and I don’t like what it’s doing to me emotionally/mentally. I think my family are getting a bit confused about how to deal with this and although they haven’t said anything I feel like they’re thinking “just get over it, the kids are fine now”. 

I don’t know why but I just can’t. The thought that this man was such a monster to his own kids just sends me spiraling thinking of what else has he done off camera? What else is happening in other homes which will never get documented? It’s sort of killing me on the inside. 

Is there a way I can stop this train of thought? I just want to go back to the way I was before because this is not helping anyone, including those poor kids.",24Sep2019,10

188,"So I have a good job. But a really really boring job that often leaves me feeling useless, unappreciated, wasted, brain dead....I could go on and on here.

So today was a day.  Not a bad day.  Just a nothing day that left me having an anxiety attack 30 minutes before I was due to leave work.  I made the mistake of calculating how many days left I had until retirement.  Close to 6000 days, 16 years and this did not help things at all.  I called my husband to come pick me up because I knew getting onto a bus would be disastrous given my state of mind.

As I am exiting the building in a daze during my anxiety attack there are two guys working on a car on the street and one of the older fellows blurts out, ""look shes pretending to be comatose!""  

Like, what the fuck man.  Your comments are very much not needed.  Mind your own damn business. This makes the whole situation exacerbated and I get into the car for an anxiety ridden ride home.

189,"I've posted before on how I had built my pride/self-esteem/self-image around my intelligence, which over the last 2 years completely shattered. 

Now my mental health is in the gutter-I will clarify that I am have it NO where near as bad as some others and kudos to those people for hanging in there-and honesty it's not great. I feel like shit basically. Like my life feelings aren't stable. I f something good happens then I ride that high until something hits me. now this hit can be anything as little as someone solving a question that I was struggling with rather easily. 

My question is, does the shit storm of procrastination -you procrastinate cause you feel shit (and maybe other reasons) and then you feel shit cause you procrastinate-, the self-doubt, self-hate, etc actually effect how one performs. Like I've read the quotes ""change the way you see things and the things you see will change"" but honestly? does my self-criticism, the calling myself stupid stuff, does it actually affect how I perform when doing homework/tests and especially when I'm in lectures and they're explaining stuff and I'm at the point where I can't even ask about what I'm confused about because I just don't understand the stuff? Like I know about having a poor mental health in the workplace will affect one’s productivity but like I'm a college student so my problem is college stuff so the whole mental health in the workplace thing wouldn't apply to me.

I used to ""think outside the box"" and used to adapt to new things very well. Now everything feels un-grounded and confusing. I feel like I have no perspective. I go to one part of town and I forget what the other part looks like. I'm getting lost driving to routine locations. It's like my brain is not stringing information together anymore.

Thus, he saw several therapists but he says that none of them helped him because they got stuck on Asperger’s aspect, explained everything with Asperger’s and failed to focus on him or his real issues (severe depression). This may or may not be true from an objective sense but this is how he perceived his experiences, thus he has no trust in therapy. He was 16 when he saw a therapist for the last time. After 10 years, he thinks that he will be treated same and I finally convinced him to give it another try. He has huge anxiety about the whole process, so he asked my help. Please help me to find a great therapist for him.

His current main issues are anxiety, negative self-image and not being able to complete his studies. I am not sure if the therapist he will see should have a specialization in autism. On one hand, it may help the therapist to understand him better but on the other hand, I am scared that he will again feel like therapist is focusing on his autism. My second question, which therapy method should he seek? As he has severe anxiety, he has huge problem with opening up and is thinking to write everything he wants to say on a paper and read it during the session instead of actually talking. I don’t know in which treatment method he would feel the most comfortable although CBT looks the best in general from my POV. Any other recommendations are also appreciated. Thank you.",24Sep2019,1
199,"I was diagnosed with aspergers last July. Initially I was extremely happy to finally get a diagnosis so that we could start treating my symptoms. I looked into some information online regarding aspergers and I became frustrated because it was as though nobody else had the same symptoms as I did. I’m really starting to doubt this diagnosis. The guy literally sat with me for one session and I didn’t even begin to scratch the surface before he diagnosed me. 

It all started with head fog. At first it wasn’t so bad but it’s gotten to the point where I don’t even know what’s real or not. I have a hard time telling dream or reality apart. Sometimes it takes me months to realize an event actually happened or vice versa. I have trouble concentrating and organizing things. I’m failing school because my head is so foggy that I can’t organize my thoughts or schoolwork. I’m even starting to have trouble reading and I mix up the letters in words when I try to write. Thank goodness for auto correct.

Another thing is the voices. The fucking voices. I can’t stand them. They mostly start talking at night and in the morning but now they’re going off during the day too. It just progressively keeps getting worse. They used to just talk about nonsense but now they’ve gained intelligence. I have full on conversations with them. They tell me to do things sometimes. They haven’t told me to do anything horrible yet though. Other times I can hear sounds in the distance in places that just wouldn’t make sense. I was in school and heard the fire alarm go off in the hall for a few seconds but nobody else batted an eye. I also hear music playing in the back of my head most of the time. My head is like a jukebox that never shuts off no matter what I do. 

I also sometimes see things that aren’t there. In my peripheral vision I always see people walking, clear as day, sometimes shadows, sometimes visibly people, but whenever I look at them they disappear. If something has intricate designs it will begin to move. The floor, for example will look like it’s traveling in waves. It gets disorienting sometimes.

I've also been trying to get better by doing things like going to the store on my own. I'm just anxious about being in a new place. I want to make new friends and join clubs but it's hard. I'm also worried that I'll have to introduce myself in front of the class. Does anyone have any advice?,24Sep2019,1

203,"So short about myself, I have high functioning autism (Aspergers syndrome) along with ADD and depression started when i became more conscious with age.
I dealt with bullying starting in kindergarten up until i was 15.
I emigrated into another country (as a kid) which took me about 5 years to truly settle and find myself somewhat comfortable.
I never knew i was autistic until i was 17 since no one explained it to me (i am 19 now).
I came out of the closet and my parents didn’t take it well so there was some verbal and physical abuse for about 2 years which traumatized me, i think.
Dinner was not very normal either or having food at home so i ate about once a day in school or sometimes nothing at all for a day or more, the food problem was ongoing for about 4-6 years until i decided to sit down and talk to my parents about it since my little sister suffered from it too.
Over the years my memory got horrible, i became numb and when i am not numb i am usually very anxious or depressed to the point it leads to meltdowns.
I honestly get angry at myself for being autistic because i often really wish that I didn’t have to deal with the symptoms that i get along with it as well as witnessing myself messing up with pretty much everything, which is very unhealthy thinking but i have a hard time not seeing it that way.
I don’t expect anyone to have a magical answer that can tell me how to be okay and how to be happy but idk maybe someone can relate to this and won’t feel alone anymore.
Thank you for your time.",24Sep2019,3

205,Idk why but I just feel like I don’t care if anyone loves me. It seems like everyone is always looking for love and affection or whatever and I just don’t get it. I don’t understand the desire to have someone care about me. Is this bad? Am I some sort of freak for not caring?,24Sep2019,1

207,"I feel like I’m messing everything up! I experience bouts of panic when someone asks me something personal, and have recently started blurting out lies to escape the anxiety. This is really scaring me because I’ve never ever been like this before and  I feel extremely guilty and ashamed of this behavior! I’ve also been ruminating excessively over the most trivial conversations, and every time I try to reason myself out of guilt, failure or a negative thought, a new on comes along. For the past three months, my mind has been numb, my chest tense, and my stomach all knotted up. I feel terrible even saying this but I really want to slip out of consciousness and escape for a while. My family is very loving and supportive,  and my mom, especially,  is someone who understands the importance of mental health and has really been encouraging  me to seek help. I haven’t told her about the recent lying tendencies because I feel so  ashamed but I’m taking her advice and planning to go to a psychiatrist. 

I can’t put into words how scared, disoriented, and overwhelmed I feel right now. This has put me at the end of my tether as I’m beginning to question my morality and ability to discern between what is real and what is not!",24Sep2019,3
208,Why am I acting strange today??? I do not feel good. I do not know where to go. I feel like I’m faking everything wrong w me cause I’m perfectly aware how weird I’m being but I can’t stop it. I couldn’t move earlier. Like I could but it was very hard and I did not like it. Nothing even makes sense. I don’t know where to go,24Sep2019,1
209,"I’ve been on seroquel for approx 6-7 years, I take 75mg. My doctor gave me permission to go off of it but the insomnia has me worried. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to deal with the insomnia, and has anyone found CBD oil helpful?",24Sep2019,1
210,"Has anyone else struggled with co-dependency, and if so how did you overcome/manage it? I’ve lost 2 great women because of this toxic trait and am looking to grow from it. I am learning to see how bad it can impact me, my relationships, and my life. Any advice? Thank you so much!",24Sep2019,1
211,"I really just want to get how I’m feeling off my chest. (Also I’m sorry if I’m posting in the wrong place)

So I finished first year of uni and moved home for summer as well as had my relationship end, I started to gain weight because I was at home again, and because of that my jeans started to feel uncomfortable and tight and I felt fat, so I stopped liking how I looked and felt in them. So I wore dresses and skirts  but I still felt fat. Then I started hating how I looked in everything. I also started getting lonely because I was single again. 

I thought that these feelings and stresses would stop once i moved back to uni and went to the gym/lost weight/kept myself busy/surrounded myself with my friends. 

I was wrong.

So now I feel like I’m going crazy because I’m still lonely, I feel like my friends don’t like me, I cant sleep easily most nights, I feel emotionally exhausted all the time and I completely dread getting dressed every morning so much that I wanna cry, I’ve also started to hate everything else too like my hair, my stuff, my classes, my personality and I feel completely hopeless.

I am planning on going to the campus counselor in a couple days and hopefully get a little help, but until then I really wanted to just vent somewhere and see if anyone might have some advice? I’ve never felt so heavily like this before.",24Sep2019,1
212,"Growing up I was always the poor kid with no father or toys, no kid was aloud to spend the night. After high school I landed a job that let me travel for free with an airline. I posted pictures to Facebook from around the world to show what I had come up with..

I was figuratively yelling from the rooftops that I had done it! I beat poverty and depression ! I’m not like my father! I’ve got life figured out!

It only set me further behind my friends who were humbly developing lifelong friendships and growing their personal identity, silently, with good intentions.

Ultimately the chips have fallen and I’m still a version of my father. Bankrupt on friends, alienated myself, self loathing my actions of my naivety.

I’ve humiliated myself publicly, and there’s no part of me that enjoys the person I’ve become.",24Sep2019,1
213,"I was talking to my best friend in my geography class and I just had this feeling like I was going to vomit or pass out or something so I had to go to the toilet because I would have been so embarrassed to have one in front of everybody. I try to not let people see past my wall that I have set up, all the fake smiles and the jokes. I can feel it slowly crumbling as people are starting to see past it. I told the school nurse about it and she is telling the guidance councillor, so finally I hope I get some help and get out of this hole I’m in. Thanks for reading.",24Sep2019,155
214,"A little background info: I'm 22 and have General Anxiety, Separation Anxiety, Major Depressive, and ADHD.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a new job recently and it's really not panning out. I purchased a car through the dealership I work for and it's only $3,000 but I have to have it paid off by the end of the year. This month $1200 is getting taken out but the rest of the time it'll only be $800. My insurance is $215 a month on top of that. My girlfriend and I are about $850 under what we need for the month to afford our bills and I don't see a way to fix that. We don't even have money to afford groceries. I don't know how to fix this and I'm overwhelmed. Part of me is really afraid that this is what the rest of my life is going to be like and if that's how it's going to be, I'd rather check out early. It's really crossing my mind today.",24Sep2019,1
215,"I did some tests and had a talk with the therapist and their conclusions scared me so much. I was actually aware of my problems and kind of knew what they were, but hearing them listed so specifically, in a 'medical' way just scared me so bad.

Instead of looking forward to getting better, which I was, now I feel so much worse. Like a total fail, damaged goods. How can I think anything else when I'm so damaged?

We scraped the surface of my central life problems and it just left me so upset along with the diagnosis.",24Sep2019,1
216,"(F16) Hello guys. These past months I been feeling so fucking ill. I been having explosive anger, binge eating problems, and just a depressed feeling. Now I would NEVER EVER go self diagnosing around. But I genuinely think I have a binge eating disorder, and I searched up the symptoms of borderline personality disorder and the symptoms look really familiar. I opened up to my mom and she just laughed at my face. She just thinks it’s a trendy thing that teens do..like no I’m actually feeling so fucking terrible right now. I had 2 suicide attempts in my life that failed. I feel I have no one. My irl friends told me to seek therapy and this happened! Just me getting laughed at! All I wanna do is go back to my unhealthy coping mechanisms and sleep all day. Also I haven’t been going to school bc I just had a depressed feeling and I didn’t wanna get out of bed. Reddit, what do I do? I was thinking of consulting my school counselor but I feel that it’ll be weird.",24Sep2019,1
