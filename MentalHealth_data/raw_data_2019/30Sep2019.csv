0,17m. I've always had anxiety issues but a lot happened yesterday and I guess it caught up with me today because my chest has been hurting all day and my breathing is irregular. It's like I'm having trouble catching my breath and about and hour ago I had an anxiety attack. My chest still hurts and my breathing is off. I'm just wondering if any of this is normal.,30Sep2019,1
1,"I'm schizoaffective with severe anxiety and depression but I still don't understand this. If someone makes a sudden loud noise even by accident, like a switch, I just snap and have to restrain myself from violent urges. I usually walk away into a bathroom and isolate myself for a bit but it will ruin my mood for sometimes hours after.

What is this and why do I react like this?",30Sep2019,2
2,"So for the past few months I’ve been feeling like I’m not even a real person and one time I had thought I had died in my sleep and went to school the next day and it was all my regular day but everything was off. I felt like I was just a walking zombie all day but then after a few days I felt back to normal. I always think nothing is real and that my eyes aren’t showing me what’s truly in front of me and that everyone is made up. Every time I dream, they’re always so vivid. An example would be me falling asleep somewhere and waking up in my own bed or having very real conversations with people over the phone and when I wake up and ask them about it they said it never happened. What’s this about?? I’m starting to feel like I’m constantly lucid dreaming when I’m awake. And right now I’m on the verge of killing myself but I don’t feel like everything is fake right now, I feel like the only real emotions I feel are when I really want to kill myself, and I don’t even want to kill myself because my life is hard, I want to kill myself just to see what’s truly there. I can’t ever sleep because I’m afraid of the dreams and I’m too afraid to see a counselor. Is this normal?? Why am I even on earth?? Is anything we do even real? I feel like everything that I see is all that’s there until I go into another room if that makes any sense.. idk, if anyone can relate or if anyone has any advice please help. Sorry for grammar",30Sep2019,1

4,I have depression but dont think it's just that. Sometimes I feel high I guess or an overwhelming sense of happiness or energy. However I do have really bad depression and suicidal thoughts.

5,"I’m only 16 and in a recent post I said I have fatanasjes about killing/ torturing family members because it’s entertaining to do but I also have a few other “problems” I just see random people on the street and I want to hurt them, for example I see a guy on a bike on the sidewalk near the road I want to push on the road and see a car crush his body and sport out his insides like a go gurt tube. There’s also this other inconvonvience for me and that is I hate crowded places and loud places. I’m currently in Seoul for a trip and things are hectic here compared to Sydney there are so many people, crowds and music. I hate it in most stores they play loud music with crowds of people shopping. I want to 1. Get out of there as fast as I can 2. Pretend like I’m having fun just so I don’t worry my mother( which is what I always do).Having more people around me has caused me to get more intrusive thoughts about killing/ torturing strangers on the street. I can’t help it  I’m going to snap, maybe I should end it myself.",30Sep2019,1

7,"I've been wanting to say something to *someone,* really anyone, for the past few days but I haven't convinced myself to do much besides eat and sleep (surprised I could muster up the courage to eat). I absolutely hate my life, I hate living life and every single ounce of energy that I have on any given day goes towards me not swallowing a bunch of my stockpiled medication. 

I quit my medication because it made me a zombie. I have this habit of always quitting medication cold turkey because I always fucking hate taking it. Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, they're all the same and they all suck. Well, I decided I wasn't going to refill this round and so for the past few days sans medication, my head has felt like it's going to implode and whole body has the shakes. Withdrawals, they can be quite the devil. My head felt so bad that when it came time to start getting ready for my first shift of the week, I talked myself into outright quitting. I called my job and told them I wasn't coming in ever again and while that's a conversation that's been a long time coming anyways, in hindsight, I probably could've made it through another week at least had it not been for all of the withdrawal symptoms amplifying my despair. 

But then again, maybe not. That job sucked anyways and now I'm left with a string of bed-ridden days on my hand that doesn't seem to have an end in sight. I'm binging on junk food because I said to hell with trying to be healthy. I have avoided my friends in lieu of watching videos of suicide attempts and depression vlogs. I've slept for over 14 hours the past 4 days at least and have only been outside to let my dog out. I hate living. 

I hate living so much. People always want to say that with suicidal people, it's not that we want to die but rather it's that we just don't want to feel the way we feel. I'd like to say that for me, it's both. Sure, it's not exactly normal to want to kill yourself (or so I'm told) but when you think of the alternative, a life lived within this fuck crazy world, how would anyone *not* want to kill themselves? HOW???

I am definitely in the red zone, in the zone that is cause for major concern and nobody has any idea. I like it that way. So that when I, the only person who really stands between my states of mortality, decide it's time, I'll have literally nobody who will stop me. That definitely brings me comfort and to be honest, it's the only thing that has brought me any comfort or ease. If nothing else, at least I have that.",30Sep2019,5
8,"Hi all, so I've never really been someone who has needed any help with their emotion and mental wellbeing but over the past week I feel  like a complete different person, I'm not sad I'm not happy I'm not anything I just feel present if that makes sense. I feel although I'm walking with a haze over my vision and though I'm not in my body when I try sleep or take a shower. I have been distant with family and friends and it's effecting them but I just don't care and  normally I put others happiness before my own and honestly If I was to be fired from my job (I used to love my job) tomorrow or if I knew i had 3 hours to left to live I just wouldn't care.  if anyone has advice for just feeling myself again I'd really appreciate it.",30Sep2019,5
9,"I had OCD and depression for 2 years. This year in early January I had finally gotten over it (I think). Some symptoms of my OCD were Trichotillomania, and Excoriation. My hair pulling was the worst, I would pull every single one of my eyelashes out and almost all of my eyebrow hairs. Every single time they grew back in I would pull them back out. I would also pick out some of my pubis hairs, leg hairs,arm hairs, and occasionally hair on my scalp.
Some kids would make fun of me, others would try to help me, and a lot of them refused to talk to me bc they though I was “a psycho”. I am still in my teens and I have just recently moved to a new school. I like this new school and blah blah I don’t want to talk about that.
Anyways, I have gone to therapy and I am on a medication for acne which actually helps with my scars from the habit of picking at my skin. I haven’t told anyone yet about how I’ve recently felt a sudden rush of sadness that causes me to not want to wake up in the morning. I’ve also had the urge to do exactly what I was doing before (pulling out my eyelashes) but I have chose not too because I don’t want people to think I’m psycho. I really hope I don’t relapse bc ocd has made the last 2 years of my life a living hell and I want to just feel happy like I have been for the past 8 months. I have recently stopped living with my dad as well. What do I do. I need help. Thanks.",30Sep2019,1
10,"Hello my friends,

I have never posted on any platform like this, so here I go.

I am at a confusing stage of life. I have recently graduated from high school. The last 2 years of high school I started really struggling with my mental health - anxiety, depression, pornography addiction, and a toxic relationship. I was very anxious going into college, as I was going to a University far away from home. I attempted suicide a few weeks in and came back home. Since I have been back home, I have struggled extensively with more of the same issues, and my level of joy is at an all time low. Even though I don’t seriously consider suicide, I find myself thinking about it on my worst days - which concerns me because I am actively trying not to consider that and am trying to improve. I have been receiving treatment from a counselor and psychiatrist, but I have continued to deteriorate mentally. At this point, I do not at all enjoy attending community college or most aspects of existence, but I still am hopeful that I can improve.

I don’t mean to complain or play victim, I simply want to paint an accurate picture of my current state so readers of this can possibly suggest resources. Does anyone know of anything I can do with my life? Are there communities I can go to for improvement? Like a grouphome for those mentally ill and seeking improvement? I live in the US.

Please suggest any resources that come to mind, I would really appreciate it. Thank you all for your time. I wish you all well.",30Sep2019,2
11,"I deal with anxiety and I've been coping for the most part through writing music and through venting to people.  Over the past few years, I've drifted from a lot of people I felt close to and it's gradually gotten to the point where I question why I open up to people in the first place.  Despite how much I want to stay closed off, my career involves a lot of socializing and I end up getting close to people through commonalities and develop great relationships with them to the point where we're close, but I'm always afraid of change over time.  I'm afraid that people will only be there for a period of time and move on and I'll end up drifting from them because of different paths in life.  I sometimes wish moments would continue to last forever pretty much, but I know people move on at some point.  I also tend to give a lot of myself to people because I want to support them and I want to be there for them, regardless of whether or not that support is given back.  I'm afraid of losing all the people I'm close to because it's happened so much already and I sometimes question what the point is of getting close to people.

I also feel like myself as a person, when I open up to people, I start to get reliant and I don't want to be, but having support makes me feel like I have someone to go, but then when that person ends up drifting, I start to wonder why I opened up in the first place.  I don't blame the person, but I blame myself for not being able to deal with things on my own and for not being able to deal with change. 

Currently, the person I feel most close to, I feel like we're slowly drifting apart because there's a lot of things going on. We used to talk a lot about different things. They're also dealing w/ mental health stuff too, so we kinda supported each other.  I opened to them as a means to show that they weren't in it alone. Now that person is slowly becoming busier, meeting other people, all while i'm still in the same place and I'm scared to lose them as a friend.  Lately I've been feeling more prone to anxiety because I'm afraid that within due time, this person will also disappear from my life and it'll be like we were never really close to begin with and I really don't want that.

I kinda just been wanting to share this somewhere. I'm not looking for advice or anything, but if you deal w/ anxiety in this sense, I'd love to hear about your experience and how you're doing.",30Sep2019,1
12,"I’m not a violent person...I guess that’s a blessing and a curse. Sometimes...actually almost ALL the time I end up in situation where I’m just silent and on the receiving end of some devastating emotional blows.

I stay composed throughout the whole ordeal and when I get to my room I just lock the door and cry. What usually happens before so breakdown is this immense desire to punch something but I just end up thinking about the damage I will cause by doing that and being unable to punch ANYTHING within my vicinity just frustrates me to the point of breaking down in tears.

13,"Hey guys! Things have been weird in this last month. I tried to quit smoking and I went trough surgery recently, both things were hard to me but finally I coped with it. 
Then, I started having horrible panic attacks and anxiety about improbable things such as getting stuck in elevators or dying in an early age. 
Now I have few and small episodes of panic attacks, and also, I’m feeling some sort of intense sadness for no apparent reasons. Sometimes I think I’m getting out of my mind, and I’m having serious thoughts about being out of reality...
I started therapy three weeks ago, but I can’t help felling worried. I’m getting really scared about everything.

15,"I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety due to pressure (a lot of overwhelming events have been happening, needing to plan a lot for the upcoming months). I think that, despite the fact that I'm handling everything well (recently lost a scholarship, dealt with an abusive family), I've been struggling with keeping myself at bay. 

I've been sleep deprived. Haven't been able to keep food down (wanting to vomit from stress daily).

I do have history with self harm (clean for about 2 years) and a single suicide attempt. I'm quite conscious now with my thoughts, but I can't seem to shrug off this feeling. I was contemplating going back to therapy, but uncertain if I can self-manage for now.

I've tried:
- Journaling
- Extensive planning
- Giving myself time to pace out work
- Practicing self-care

And yet, I still feel a bit lost. Is there anything particular you guys do when you're overwhelmed to keep yourself stable? I don't like the idea of falling back in again after all the progress I've made. But I feel like all the planning I'm making is overwhelming me rather than helping.

Any piece of advice?",30Sep2019,3

19,"So my life story, lets start at the earliest memory i can remember it had to before i was 9 since that's when my mother dies i was sitting in a high chair asking for pancakes i remember her breaking down in crying in my fathers arms after that i remember being with my step father i don't remember the order of things but i remember him being quit but nice most of the time but not always once he started to drink he became violent i remember him making us on the back of the head me and my brother hard enough to knock us off are feet and if we setting down hard enough into a table some times knocking us out i remember the worse of it one day i had to hid between a large rose bush and concrete steps leading into the house so i would not get hit as my mother took the blows i remember her walking to me and my brother bed room when he set bruised as she song something to be some point i started to see things or i said i saw things just for attention so i was placed on meds that increased my weight quickly and significantly about a year maybe two prior to her death her mother my grandmother died from some type of cancer i cant remember what type but after that my mother started to try and kill her self she was a diabetic and kept over dosing on her insulin i remember visiting her in the hospital multiple time till one day i watch her inject multiple needles worth of insulin into her self she said something to me after i said something to her i ran back to my step fathers room were he was sleeping and woke him up trying to tell him wound up getting slapped so hard it dislocated my bottom jaw i know since it was not the first time we were told she was found dead three days after that, that day my father who up to that time i barely knew took us in he drunk a lot back thin he would go though a large bottle of vodka with cranberry juice ever two or less days at first things were great though we moved around a lot so i never made any friends but after moving to Florida my father desired to get married we will call her the crazy bitch or CB for short i think i was eleven or twelfth when they got marred didn't know or much before hand not that i can remember this is when my life took a 180 first year or so everything was fine though her 2 children always bulled me hitting name calling making fun of my weight ect basically what ever they could and i could never defend my self because if i did i would get grounded same as my brother as time went on this got worse fast the bulling turned into holding me down and each one taking turns beating me up after first time i went to the police despite me being covered in bruises they didn't believe me and some how my step mother found out and the beating i took was so bad i could barely breath CB two sons took turns sodomizing me after that i turned fourteenth and by brother left when a friend took him in and all they things that was happening split between us were now all on me do things got worse though i was never forced to indue the sodomizing again. the beating and abuse got so bad i was not even allowed to eat her food any more and was forced to sleep out side in the wet or dry hot or cold and i was only allowed inside to do my chores what i had to walk home from school witch was about 30 minutes away and i had to do all the chores before she got home at 4 so school gets out at 3 30 min to walk home and 2-3 hours worth of work in 30 min safe to say i rarely ever could so i would get screamed at and had things thrown at me till i did in order to be let in the house or to be allowed to eat i had to pay about $900 for rent and $400 for food i was fourteen about this time by father started so sober up a bit and would give me money to get me by and take me on his work trips since he was a handyman and would travel a lot of places though out the country i think it was his way of apologizing at the age of 17 her youngest son attack me and since her eldest was moved away i fought back for the first time since i didn't care if i lived or died any more i beat him til my first were bloody i would have killed him if his mother didn't knock me out with a skillet were i was sent to a place known as vista for a few weeks they left me out were my father informed me CB backed up after that day and left i though it was over but a few nights after when i finally had a bed to sleep in my father had to leave for work and would be gone a few days i can remember if it was day one or two but Robert came back i was sleeping when he but a shotgun up to my ear and pulled the trigger waking me up and beating on me and drags me out the door telling me hes going enjoy killing me he threw me into his truck and speed off any time i made a whimper i would get hit not long up the road there was a police road block with them yelling something at him he dragged me out of the truck to my neck i don't remember what happened after that all i remember is being in the hospital with my dad

23,"I live with my mother and my two younger brothers. My mother is very strict and more importantly very religious. All throughout my life I have been very angry and agitated. When I was in elementary school I always got in trouble. I would lash out at other children and teachers, scream curse words and even throw chairs at other people. I was a big problem so I switched schools a couple of times. Then my mother decided it would be best to home school me because I cannot socialize with others or focus in school. My mother has always said things like that I am a bad seed, cursed or even the human form of a demon. She also was not saying this jokingly and still believes to this day that I myself am a curse. Nowadays I rarely go outside or even speak to my mother or my brothers because I don't want to hear their mouths. I frequently hear voices and sounds such as people giggling, chattering, growling, humming, singing or even yelling. When I hear these voices everything around me seems to become a little less real. As if I'm not actually not really in the room and I'm just floating around. I often feel dizzy and tired even though I get plenty of sleep. I'm often scared of what could be lurking outside, especially late at night when I lay down to go to bed. Even if the curtains are down and the door is closed I still feel like somebody is staring holes through me. My mother says that it's because God is staring down at me and making me feel his wrath for having a heart full of hatred and revenge. I've asked to go to therapy but my mother refuses and insists that if I would just let God into my heart I would feel better and i would stop feeling these feelings. She said if i just opened myself up to the lord he'd stop screaming at me and I would feel at peace. Although I was hesitant at first I'm starting to believe her. I think that God is punishing me for being so mean and cruel. But another part of me believes that if I could only seek out the help of a doctor or a therapist that they could fix me. Since my mother won't let me the only help I have is speaking to people online and seeking advice. Is there anything that i can do to feel better and make this madness come to an end?",30Sep2019,1

26,"I'm a high school freshman, so that might contribute to some of this. Before I start, I'd like to give you guys some context about my situation. I've dealt with self esteem issues my whole life. I feel like what makes my situation unique is 2 things;
1: I'm not a super shy person, and I actually have a good amount of friends. I even have a date to homecoming. I'm not the most popular guy in school, but I'm definitely closer to the top of the totem pole, so to speak.
2: My conscious mind realizes that a lot of these concerns are unfounded. I'm not a bad looking guy, I'm athletic, and I am not socially awkward to the point where its crippling. I sometimes just have that teenage awkwardness, but on good days, I recognize that I can be charming.


I just said a lot of good things about myself. I realize that these things arent far from the truth, but my brain is telling me otherwise. But on the outside, I'm a happy go lucky kid, who couldn't give less of a shit about what others think about him.


On the inside, I'm the complete opposite. In reality, I always wonder what everybody thinks about me. I always feel paranoid that people are talking behind my back. Theres one friend that I have, where I'm completely certain, that when I turn my back, they arent talking bad about me. Even the littlest things get me down. Just yesterday, a girl who I dont even know left me on opened on Snapchat; normal people would shrug it off- I thought about it for hours. Everytime anything like that happens, I start to tell myself that nobody even likes me, and that I'm all on my own, which I know isnt exactly true, but my brain is telling me that it is. 
There is another situation going on at school between me and a close friend. That issue isnt even my fault, yet, due to some pressure from my parents to get the friendship back together, I have somehow put the blame on myself. The exact situation isnt necessary, but basically, the issue is that hes jealous of me. Not my fault, right? But somehow, I paint the picture in my mind that it is. The situation stressed me out so much that I almost cried during class. One of my close friends and my homecoming date were there, 2 people who I could completely trust with my feelings. Yet, I stopped myself, put on a smile, and went about my day. 
It's gotten to the point where, even though I'm not void of girl friends, whenever I see guys hanging out with girls, I become stressed out, and embarrassed, because I dont have as many friends that are girls as other people. That stems from the fact that guys at my middle school didnt really hang out with girls very much. Now, everytime I go to school, I feel stressed out about so many things. I just want this feeling of sadness and darkness to go away, but it seems like certain things trigger it (i.e. certain songs, certain reminders of people). I dont know what I'm looking for on this subreddit. I just want some help, some support, and mainly advice on how to stop whatever is oncoming before it gets worse, and gets in the way of school or sports.

the problem with my dad is that he has parkinson's disease so he stopped working when i was in high school, never had a good relationship with him. He always stole money from me and my siblings and recently stole some much from my mom.

Last week he went on a cruise with my grandma whom he currently takes care of ( not really, cause i do everything) and she has advance Alzheimer's. I found out he's been gambling over $1k a day for 8 days.

I really need him out of this house, he is toxic. Anyone know any rehab centre i can send him away too?! I can't take it much longer!",30Sep2019,1

31,"Hi everyone. Idk how to begin other than to just describe my symptoms. I’m tapering off Zoloft and I’ve been on Wellbutrin for about 3 weeks or so now, but I was on Zoloft for 2-3 years and recently my symptoms have gotten way worse (last 3-4mo)

Anyway: i experience intense delusion I think. I lay down in bed and instantly I just think of okay what if that happens at school, what if this happens at work, how do I act, how do I respond, how can I prevent x. The worries come and go but when they come, they come. I instantly tune out everything in the world.

Sometimes I talk to myself. I hear voice in my head, and I can’t really tell if it’s mine, but I have conversations in my head. 

I love being alone. I’m married and I love that, but other than my wife, I want to be alone. It’s not really social anxiety, but rather I just don’t WANT to do anything. I also have mood swings. In addition to that I pretty much don’t have much feelings. I don’t really have empathy or care much for others outside of my family. Not that I wish them bad but I just don’t really care.

If anything happens, even minor, I think about it which goes back to my compulsive worrying. One day at work, I messed up, and it was rather minor but the next 3-4 days I had scenarios playing out in my head for the most disastrous outcomes.

I can’t keep still in class. I’m always shaking my legs. I’m always on edge. It’s hard to study because I can’t sit down and relax and then just study. I feel I’m going crazy because my cognition is feeing like it’s going down. I read the same sentence, MINDFULLY, and have to read it 3-4 more times to even make sense of it. It’s so exhausting studying and takes hours. 

At night I get paranoia sometimes. If I get up to pee I instantly think of any scare movie I’ve seen and picture the villain or whatever sitting in my closet staring at me. Sometimes during the day maybe. I think people are staring at me, judging me, out to get me, and I just feel uncomfortable. 

I have random thoughts of hurting certain things. Like I hate cats and wouldn’t care if anything happened to one or I did anything to one. The paranoia of going to prison or something keeps me from doing most things bad. I’m not saying I would anyway because I wouldn’t. But yea I don’t like cats. I think of myself as a good person I guess. I try to be at least.  

Anyways idk what this was about but I needed to vent and maybe have some advice.

TLDR: I worry a lot, I have no empathy, I get paranoid, I don’t care sometimes, and I need help.",30Sep2019,1
32,"My first anti-depressant (Citalopram) worked great, but my doctor was concerned with some of its side effects and put me on Escitalopram. Ironically, I felt more side effects (primarily dizziness) on that one, so we went back to the first. While mentally Citalopram worked wonders, on it I gained 20 lbs in six months despite working out 2-3 times a week and hiking on Saturdays. Because of this, I switched to Bupropian. On top of the dizziness (despite a l-o-n-g tapering off Citalopram), I'm still dizzy and feeling super low and weepy.

I'm going to the doctor to discuss this but would like to know: How many anti-depressants did you have to try before finding one that worked? It would make me feel better to know I'm not the only one looking at trying a fourth.",30Sep2019,1

34,"I want to write this as briefly as possible. It started with severe anxiety. I ended up with panic attacks. I have learned over time how to mitigate, lower and control anxiety, so that is not a life-crippling issue. I consistently put myself into anxious situations to overcome my fears. But my other problem, for which I have no name, is this. When I am in a stressful situation, such as a job interview, I get teary eyed like I want to cry. I've had certain life events which left me with deep emotional ""blockage"" so to say. I have been unemployed for three years because of this hyper-sensitivity. I've had to rely on ""external aids"" in order to allow myself to cry, and that hasn't fixed the problem. All the professionals, except the counsellor I go irregularity, have been rude or haughty.

37,"Now, I was managing my life pretty well up until around a month ago. Occasional bad decisions here and there throughout highschool but nothing extreme and I was finally coming out of my shell at 18, however, some extremely concerning things have been happening.

I've been hearing muffled/mumbled words occasionally with no idea where they're coming from, as well as frequent knocking sounds and my father calling my name when I'm home alone. Naturally this freaks me out, but I've started to get extremely distrusting of everyone I meet. It feels like I'm constantly being watched by everyone I talk to and like they're all judging me or wanting to hurt me somehow. I know afterwards that this isn't true though most of the time, but sometimes it takes a while and the feeling doesn't go away.

Naturally alone that doesn't seem like it is necessarily a huge deal, could just be anxiety flaring up and stress, I guess, but my friends called me out on cancelling shit left and right and avoiding people, and today I'm 100% sure I briefly saw *water pouring out of my shoe* when I went to put it on leaving my buddy's house. He was just staring at me when I flinched and had to do a double take. Mild visual hallucinations like little white wisps for short periods are nothing new to me but I always discredited them as my eyes playing tricks on me until that. That shit freaked me the fuck out, yo, and it made me notice things I've been doing lately. Switched operating systems to Qubes because I'm paranoid about the NSA, browsing with Whonix frequently, IME neutering, just privacy freak shit. Started covering my webcam etc even though I know that's pretty stupid when I actually think about it. Weird speech patterns and inflections and movements.

 I've become hyper-aware of everything I'm doing since then, and I asked some friends if they've noticed anything, and it was universally yes, and apparently they've been noticing for weeks now. Maybe it's been building up slowly for longer and I only noticed recently. 

I've started taking notes on the shit I've been doing and feeling too so I can read them later and see what's happening. I've also been having a lot of trouble sticking to a regular sleep cycle.

Am I going out of my mind? I have a family history of psychotic disorders on both sides which doesn't help my paranoia. And even though I'm pretty sure I'm losing my SHIT here, for some reason I seem to forget all about that occasionally and not notice that I've been really, really off until someone points it out. I'm unable to seek professional help right now due to family issues and cost.

Am I a schizo...? I looked it up and the symptoms line up a bit too scarily as well as the onset and I'm freaking out here because I need to get professional help ASAP before i get really bad but I don't know when or if I can, parents aren't exactly A+ people and that shit costs a lot of money",30Sep2019,1

39,"hello kind strangers!

so i (23F) have a long history of depression and always around this time of year it gets much worse. overall, in the past two years i’ve been doing better and tend to have mostly good days with very few bad days. i’m currently unmediated and haven’t been going to therapy bc i’m a broke grad student and my school has a very long waitlist for therapists. 

while i generally have been doing well, i’ve noticed that when my boyfriend (24M) who lives with me is gone for longer than a day or two, i slip back into my old habits and essentially can’t take care of myself at all. (think no food, forgetting to shower, sleeping a lot, just netflix and basic stuff like showing up to class) i wouldn’t say he does things for me when he’s home, but more that he is my support system and i definitely rely on him a lot emotionally. i don’t live near family or many friends except for a few fellow grad students, so i’m at a loss at how to get through this when he’s gone.

i’m going to try to go to therapy as soon as i can, but he’s gone for the next week and i haven’t been eating and am afraid to start really slipping backwards. any advice or help is welcome!! (for reference i go to school in utah. i’ve checked with my CAPS program and the therapist wait list is crazy long)

41,"I don't even know if this is worth posting, compared to a lot of other people on this sub I don't know if I actually have a problem but whatever if I don't I'm sure someone will reality check me so here goes.

I often have suicidal thoughts, just throughout the day they just come into my head, for instance a common one when I am driving is ""life would be so much easier if I didn't make this turn and died in the crash"". Or if I am home alone, I think about drinking poison or cutting my wrists just so I don't have to do life anymore. I haven't acted on these thoughts ever and don't think I would, but I don't know why I keep thinking them. To an extent I do agree with the idea, to die is to relieve yourself on any burdens or hardships (but to also lose your chance to do the numerous good things in life)

My life is pretty good,I have a good family, I have a good job with good coworkers, I have lots of friends from church and friends from other activities like old school friends I still see very often and share life with, I'm active in my church and devout in my faith, no SO but that is what it is.

I can't get mental health help because of all my responsibilities with my 5 classes this term, I have 4 midterms next week which people say is enough to study for but my brain just can't focus even a little bit anymore. I come home from university and my mind just goes blank and I can't do anything.

I haven't made any friends, my OCD is incredibly awful to deal with when my school tensions ease up, and I'm having a crisis about getting uglier/going bald as I get older, I can't tell what I even truly look like anymore.

I got a doctors appointment outside of my Uni because wait times are horrendous inside, but she acted like I was an idiot for wanting that, but ended up booking me for a physical anyway.

45,"I can't believe I'm even making this post right now, but here I am typing this.  I'm 17 years old, which I know is still pretty young, but it's a lot longer than I ever thought I would live.  I honestly never imagined I would make it this far.  Only a while ago, I was in the hospital for around 7 months.  After that came a year of group therapy, family therapy, and personal therapy.  Along with those were the psychiatry visits and the locked silverware drawers and the mandatory chaperone everywhere I went.  Tonight I was researching ideas for my graduation party, and it just hit me how far I've come.  I hid my depression and anxiety for years, and when I went to the hospital, I was at rock bottom.  I honestly thought I might be a hopeless case.  

The concept of recovery was terrifying and foreign to me.  I didn't want to leave behind the things that were both destroying and comforting me.  It was the hardest thing I have ever done to recover, and I'm still working on it, honestly.  I recently relapsed pretty badly and I'm trying to dig myself back out of that hole again, but I'm pretty damn proud of myself.  There was a time when my bad days were a lot more serious than crying in bed and not being able to take a shower, and looking back on my progress so far, I'm so proud of the person I've become.  I don't have it all together yet, but I really love the process of figuring out who I am when I separate myself from my depression and anxiety.  Even things as simple as my favorite color have all changed as I tried to start over and meet myself for the first time and separate from my social anxiety and my depression.  I cannot tell you how amazing it is to look at myself now and realize that I love telling jokes, my favorite colors are lime green and teal, and I love Panic at the Disco.  Compared to how stiff and withdrawn I used to be, I'm so glad I've gotten comfortable enough in my own skin to crack a joke or two and to make new friends.  I even ditched some old 'friends' this year that were causing damage to my mental health and my self-esteem.  In the process, I realized the people who I care about more than anyone else, and I see a future full of hope.

To be writing this right now, I'm actually crying.  I'm going to graduate high school 5 months earlier than the rest of my class this year.  I went to the kitchen earlier and used a knife to cut an apple, and the drawers in our house don't have locks anymore.  I went to church alone the other day, because my parents finally trust that I can take care of myself again.  For once in my life, my smile is genuine.  Some days are still hard, but most are at least a little easier.  I know lots of people talk about how it gets better, and I think I finally understand what they mean now.  Life doesn't necessarily get better, but you do.  Over time, you learn how to navigate the waves, until you learn to swim.  Then, when your head goes underwater, you hold your breath and start swimming to the surface again, and every time you do, you get a little stronger and a little better at swimming.  

I guess what I'm getting at is that I'm so glad I chose to hold on, because I'm learning to value myself and my life, and for once I feel like I'm thriving instead of surviving.  I wouldn't trade this feeling for the world.",30Sep2019,14
46,"Throwaway because I dont know who may or may not know my username. I am currently working a full-time job while also going to school. I am the most mentally exhausted Ive been in my entire life an most days I can barely get through the things that I need to do. I know that this is not a serious mental health issue but honestly I am just burned out with everything in general. It has lead to decreased socialization and, what people who know me well perceive as, a ""lack of enthusiasm for being around them."" I am happy to be around them and it definitely helps me to have people to talk to but I honestly dont have the mental energy to exert on anything other than getting my points across in conversations without any other emotion behind it.

One of these people is my partner. They have noticed the change to my situation and have been pointing it out to me over the past few months. Now they are dealing with some possibly serious mental health issues of their own and Im having trouble balancing my life, my burnout and their situation. Everything about their personality has gotten worse and worse over the course of about a year (we have been together for around 3) including extreme mood swings, great bouts of sadness, and aggressiveness. Every time, we try to talk about getting help or the steps to take to get to that point it always arrives at the same conclusion, they are scared to know, dont want to know, and would rather just internalize the problem and deal with it possibly forever. That is honestly the alternative that they see is a better way to handle this situation rather than getting the help that they may want. 

It is getting unbelievable frustrating and I know that I am lashing out at them at this point when they complain about their issues (mood swings, general sadness) because I know that theses issues can be remedied if they just seek help that I cannot provide. Can anyone give me advice on how I should proceed because soon, I may reach my breaking point and it wont be healthy for either one of us if that happens given the timing of everything.

Honestly, I never thought about it until she asked me that and now I realize how bad my memory can be. No joke, I can do something in the morning and not even remember if I did it a few hours later. It almost hurts my brain if I try to remember and then I start to panic. It’s been especially bad with me taking my new medication. I’ll sit at work and think “holy crap did I take my antidepressants???” Freak out and go home to count how many I have left to make sure. I do have an alarm that tells me when I take it but it’s almost like I can’t remember if I actually did it.

I get really mad at anyone who does anything even a little mean to me, and I blow things out of proportion. I am constantly looking for reassurance, by asking people if they even care or like me, I can't continue any projects because I hate hitting hurdles, I hate feeling like I'm not good enough for anything.

Programming is a big hobby, I enjoy doing it, but I am afraid of overcoming my plateau, because I'm scared it'll only be a waste of time.

I have friends, but they don't make me feel valued. I don't trust anyone. Everything negative that has happened to me throughout my life has been my own problem, that is it's my fault. I'm not a smart guy either, infact I've got an average intelligence, so there not much room for career advancement. Did I mention my lackluster social skills? Infact upon further research I can almost say that I might be autistic. Its unfortunate because I want to go into business as a career path, but you need social skills for that. 

All I want right now is to feel romantic love. I want to feel a deep emotional connection with someone. I want to experience feeling like I truly mean something to someone outside my family.

I tell myself to think of the positives, but there are none, or well the negatives outweigh the positives.

The issue was with my dad, he didn’t and still doesn’t know about the subject and didn’t want to pay for it (which I understand is his money) he also doesn’t  want my grandmother to pay for it, and also wanted me to go underwent surgery with an unqualified doctor for less money..

59,i can feel myself spinning out and i have no idea how to stop it. i’ve been sitting in my sink for the last fourty minutes digging at my pores with my nails trying to pull all the dirt out of my skin (because i think the filth in my body has something to do with the filth at the core of my being and i know it’s delusional but i can’t snap out of it) and i haven’t showered since tuesday but i can’t go to inpatient again because 1) i have school and 2) if i go to the hospital again my parents will make me go home and being in the same house as them for so long just makes everything worse. i’m so much more comfortable on my own but i’m too anxious to make any appointments to get treatment and my meds don’t work so i stopped taking them and even if i wanted to try them again i wouldn’t be able to remember to take them every day so it wouldn’t even matter. this is the fourth med i’ve tried for depression and none of them work and the shit they give me for anxiety doesn’t work either and i’m so afraid i’m going to be like this forever. right before i spun out last year i managed to fuck up the strongest friendships i had in person just by isolating and i’m so worried i’m going to ice everyone out again and the ones who stayed will eventually leave too because i’m going insane. i have such a hard time even being interested in spending time with my friends it feels like i’m on another planet half the time. health just seems so far away that it’s not even worth trying,30Sep2019,4

I can't get out of bed. I don't think it's lack of motivation but rather that I don't see a reason to.  Everything just feels so gray and repetitive now, nothing is exciting or content. I have to literally drag myself to school where I sludge alongz but the second I get back it's straight to my bed with the door closed and covers pulls up. It's same for the weekends too.

I don't do my homework or talk to my friends. I've kind of separated from my friends it feels like, and it doesn't even bother me in the slightest. Eating is becoming hard. Typing this is taking much longer than it should.

69,"Sorry, I'm new here and I never really have done this kind of thing before. I know people will strongly suggest I go see a doctor / therapist / etc... In my story I will explain why that's not really an option. That being said, a handful of people know my story, and they browse reddit. If you do know me, please don't treat me differently, or talk about this. Onto the story...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old, typical nerdy guy. I turn 22 on Tuesday and that's partially why I'm writing this. I've had a really shitty 10 years, and today has felt the worst. So, I grew up with video games. My dad used to build computers, and one of my first video games ever was Quake 3: Arena. This was 2004. I also grew up playing Half-Life 2. Half-Life 2 was crazy to me, but it was one upped by Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Essentially from 5 to 16 I played HL2:DM religiously. I loved it, I met my closest friends on that game, and it was something I looked forward to after coming home from school. Around my 5th and 6th grade years of school I became victim to bullies. I withdrew socially, and just wanted to play hl2dm, and that's what I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I like to think I'm over the bullying, and torment, but it had some ""Unforeseen Consequences."" My parents, around this time started me on therapy, and psychiatry, for fairly obvious reasons, that weren't so obvious. My parents at a young age, had me tested for Autism, and apparently I came back positive with Asperger's Syndrome. So all of the sudden, they think I'm being bullied because of AS. I believed them for almost a decade. over time though, I saw some red flags. I did my own research and what not. I don't believe I have AS. I feel like that was an excuse my parent's used to explain my bullying. Even to this day they believe it. Now, why do I believe I don't have AS? Well, there are a couple of minor red flags, and one major red flag. I'll skip the minor details, but every time I ask them to provide any documents, doctors, or anything, they always respond with ""I don't know where it is,"" ""Ill have to look for them,"" etc... This started around 2012. 

&amp;#x200B;

So for years, I was being treated for something I don't feel like I have, taking meds, and talking to a therapist to ease tension between me and my parents at home. I don't believe I'm a problem child but I would always get into arguments with my parents. specifically my dad. It got to a point where one day it got physical. This in their minds reinforced I had AS. Where in my mind, I was being punished by having to go to therapy. All I ever wanted was to play hl2dm. So, I essentially isolated myself from the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

My 7th and 8th grade years were great, because I switched schools and met a group of amazing friends. The school was especially small, with the 7th and 8th grade class making up 25 kids, out of 70. We were close. I was happy then, but now I don't know how I feel. I had friends, both online and in person. It slowly started falling apart from there. I started high school at a very prestigious school known for its academics and high acceptance rate into ivy league schools. I wasn't dumb, or anything like that, but I threw away my greatest life opportunity. I got kicked out for bad grades. I wasn't failing tests or quizzes, but homework always caught me. I just didn't care about school, or life. I just wanted to play hl2dm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around the end of my freshmen year, I started becoming agitated easily. It got to the point where I would be fighting with my dad every day. One day was particularly bad. It was mid day Saturday. I don't even remember what we were fighting about, but I told him I wish he wasn't my dad, and I wanted him out of my life. fast forward a couple of months, and he decided to divorce my mom. I still remember the day he told me. Him and I went out to eat, and we were driving home when he told me he wanted to show me something. We drive past our house and around a few streets to another house. We parked and he told me that he was going to be living there for a little bit. I just sat there, with my head turned the other why trying so hard not to burst into tears. I just wish I said something that night, and not act like I didn't care. maybe he would still be around... That was the end of 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, the next few years are blurry. I just blocked everything out. By this point I had a new ambition. I was playing csgo now, with the same set of people I grew up with on hl2dm. That's all I cared about. I just wanted to play on my computer. I was alone in real life, and put on a facade of happiness. fast forward to now, where I feel like my life is a living nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

I turn 22, on October 1st. I constantly think about how different my life would have been if I just never played hl2dm. Would I have graduated from my original high school to go into an ivy league school? Would my dad have stayed around if I just said something that night? Would I be happy? I know thinking about that wont change anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Half-Life 2: Deathmatch was the start of my torment. I've pretty much always known what I wanted to do in life. I wanted to create games like Quake, and Half-life, because they made me happy. They distracted me from what was going on. Around my 9th grade year, I don't know what happened, but I lost all interest in everything. I wasn't having fun playing games, with the people I grew up with. I didn't want to talk to anyone because I have so much anxiety, and trust issues. I have become so self destructive, with the group of friends I did have IRL I recently just exploded over the tiniest thing. I'm losing all my friends online because I just don't want to do anything, and I've become extremely depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I had a clear vision, but somewhere my ambition fizzled out. I only wanted to play video games. I have no other hobbies, or interests. I'm alone again, and I don't want to be. I told my mom about my depression, and that was 6 months ago, nothing changed. I feel like I'm just in an endless loop. I try to do better, but I always fuck things up in the end. I literally only see my dad twice a year now, and not even on my birthday. I look at myself in the mirror and I just don't even know who I am. I don't know who my mom, or sister are. I just remember all the bad things that have happened to me, and the very few good memories I have are fading because I just get so sad now. Some days I feel like everything changed, and I get stuff done, but usually the next day I'm back at rock bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would go to a doctor on my own, but I don't have a drivers license because my mom wont let me get one, and even if I do get one I don't have a car. I don't even have enough money for an uber. I would talk to my friends, but I feel like im such a burden. I want friends, I want a life where I can be happy. I need help with socializing, with repairing things with my dad, with building a healthy life where I don't self destruct. I just need help...",30Sep2019,4

72,"hey, i'm a 17-year-old guy in the U.S. and i've really been struggling recently. my situation is pretty difficult to explain concisely, so i hope i can describe what i'm dealing with in a way that makes sense. in essence, i've participated in competitive interscholastic debate for the past 3 years of high school, and i've been extremely committed to the activity, garnering some level of national success and recognition last year (my junior year).  


however, a few months ago (around july), the entire debate team received an email from our coach, who was tendering his resignation. i was absolutely devastated. i had looked up to him, and a big part of the reason i wanted to succeed was to make him proud. i was under the impression that we had a somewhat close mentor-mentee relationship, and the fact that he had not once alluded to this or given me any sort of heads up destroyed me. i understood why he resigned, given that the school did not treat him particularly well, but the abruptness of his resignation has deeply affected me in a way that i struggle to explain. i feel abandoned. i feel like i'm not good enough. i feel like maybe i could've done something better. part of me knows that's not true, but another other part of me is convinced that inevitable abandonment is an absolute constant in the universe.  


now, since then, i have transferred schools, because my former coach's resignation led me to acknowledge that the only reason i had continued attending the private school where i had been was out of an obligation to the debate team. i hated the school, and am far better off now, in the abstract. the debate team at my new school is not nearly as toxic as the team at my old school, and i am more successful than ever.   


but i can't stop thinking about july, when i first read that email. recently, i've been staying up late, just thinking about it. thinking about how angry i am, how sad i am, and what could have been done differently. beyond that, i've noticed recently that every social anxiety issue i have (i've struggled with this for most of my teenage life, and haven't really sought treatment, but i have some friends who support me and i deal with it just fine, usually), has been magnified recently. i can barely carry out a conversation with a stranger. i will never ever ever approach anybody i don't know for any reason unless there is no alternative. i've even been scared to order food. i don't know why. i think part of me is scared that every new person i meet will recognize that i'm a failure or something; i'm not sure.  


i'm not really sure why i wrote all this. venting is good, i guess. i would appreciate advice on how to deal with this, because i've been struggling a lot.  


thanks!",30Sep2019,2
73,"So lately ive been having this weird thing happen where i just want everything to be normal. By and large it is but my brain is craving like, the sense of safety of a shitty family meal in the food court when we all laughed or a day where i dont feel so tired i cant laugh.  I know this just sounds kinda like depression but its different. Its like im yearning for a normal feeling in my heart that i dont think ever existed. i just want a strong family feeling of support to be there and it not be wrapped in all the trappings of adulthood.

74,"I'd like to start of by saying that I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough and that I hope you don't judge me too much on what I'm about to say. It's just been a problem I have and I don't want to tell my friends or family because I don't want to burden them anymore. 

I've been on medication for 3 years now and I've had my illness for 8 years. I have bipolar disorder 2 and the hypomania has been great. I mean. Really. Great. I get up in the morning with a smile, I go about the day's activities with so much love and happiness. I really feel like I can conquer the world and I do my best to make everyone around me feel the positive energy that I radiate. 

It just sucks to think that for every bout of happiness I get, comes the inevitable crash days after. And what's worse is that the crash happens to be twice as long as the high. I've had a recent episode of self harm and I am ashamed of the scars whenever I go to school. I wear jackets and long-sleeved shirts at the expense of my comfort to hide them. I also skip school almost every friday for the past month with different excuses to tell the people in school - sprain, fever, vomiting, etc. During the past three weeks, I have been severely depressed, but just this weekend, I've gotten into intense hypomania and now it feel like I'm crashing...

If there was a way that I could just stay hypomanic and happy all the time, I would do that. I've tried to address the problem by meditating, drinking my meds on time, sleeping early and waking up early, avoiding caffeine and nicotine, but it didn't last long. I also tried downloading a bunch of apps to track my mood. I've also listened to podcasts about my mental health disorder and a lot more in the hopes that I could find some treatment that I could do on my own if my psychiatrist wasn't available. These may all be great, but as soon as I gave into temptation, the coping mechanisms that I have (e.g. smoking) got worse. I relapsed hard. I find myself looking for a cigarette every time I'm stressed and it's been hard to control the addiction. 

If there are any tips, words of encouragement, personal anecdotes that could make me feel like I'm not so alone during these times, it would be really helpful. I just want to feel like I'm me again. Lately, it feels like I've been living someone else's life and it feels so surreal to think that nothing really matters... But it's really just an endless rabbit hole where I'm clawing my way to escape it. 

TLDR; I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 2. Had three weeks of severe depression and 2 days of hypomania. For the past week, I've tried to stabilize my mood but I relapsed... Need help, please.",30Sep2019,2
75,"We have heard it a million times. ""You get upset too easily."" Or ""why do you let things bother you?"" Usually followed by self adulation like ""I just don't sweat these things.""

Well, WHOOPIDIDY DOO you privileged piece of shit. Just Once, I'd like to just be able to say fuck it and show people what its like. Let  them experience the hell that I suffer when I get in my moments. For background, I have no clue what my diagnosis is. I've seen several doctors, each confounded as to what ""disorder"" to label me. Bi-Polar, Bi-Polar 1 or 2, Anxiety Disorder, Agoraphobic, Clinical Depression, Acute Panic attacks, OCD. I've been on Paxil, Lithium, Seroquel, Burspirone, Lamictal, Lexapro and other I can't remember. All at different times, sometimes all at once, at varying doses. Upping doses, lowering doses, cutting pills. All while the incalculable variations are altering my brain chemistry in unpredictable ways. While attempting to maintain some sort of semblance of an adult life, navigating the real world.

Hold your breath. Just hold it. As your body begins to use up the limited amount of oxygen if has taken in, something starts to happen. An unstoppable chain reaction occurs. Your muscles begin to tighten and twitch, slightly. Your eyes dart too and fro. The first 15 to 20 seconds, you seem fine. You are still rational. But reach 30 seconds, 40, 50... Things go down hill fast. Your body starts to want to act on its own. Begging to lash out. Grasp at your throat. Flail your limbs. You can still hold back the urge. 60 seconds...1 minute and 5 seconds. You begin to panic, ever so slightly. And then you breathe. A few quick huffs, and then it all seemed silly as you chuckle it all off. But now imagine this. You take that breathe, but your body still thinks you aren't breathing. Panic ramps up into overdrive. You breathe deeper, but it doesn't help. Your body is desperate to combat the something that isn't there. You want to scream out. Hit something. Run away. But there isn't anything there. At this point the world becomes distorted. Nothing is right, everything is wrong. Off. Your perception of reality is altered. While everyone around you is telling you to ""calm down.""

But I can't. I don't know how to control it, or turn it off. Except... Well, there Is one way. I've got to hurt myself, bad. I've jabbed countless pens and pencils into my limbs. Raked deep gashed through my skin with my nails. Bashed my head against brick walls. Which flips something in me. Like a wave, or vibration washes through my body. A sound I can't hear, only feel. And I can ""breathe"" again. And the world is focused. Reality is back to normal. I'm sobbing like a child, and then I have to check myself. How do I explains this bruise Now. Or why am I bleeding again? Where did that wound come from? And I can't tell ANYONE the truth. I've tried. No one wants the truth. I can't remember how many people I've alienated because of this. Family, friends, partners, co-workers. I've lost jobs, homes. I've lost possessions and parts of my life. What I can remember though is the reaction. That face. A blank look of contempt. I can clock the moment in someones eyes when I've lost them. And I can hear their voice in my head, or my voice, playing the broken record of judgmental labels and comments playing on repeat.

Then I slip into this, funk. I hurt, in ways so few will ever know. I'm lethargic. Apathetic. I'm SO lonely. But I can't handle the thought of someone leaving, again. So, I spend my time alone. Watching YouTube. Ranting anonymously on social media forum &lt;---. Then comes the ""Man Up"" inner voice. ""Stop being a bitch."" The guilt of not having ANY REASON TO BE LIKE THIS DAMMIT! I've never been sexually assaulted. I was never physically abused as a child. Starved or beaten. Sure, I was bullied a little. Big deal, I was the fat kid. So, why!? 

I once stepped onto the highway in the middle of the night. I just stood there. I wanted someone to end it. The car swerved. I just walked away. Fell behind some nearby bushes. and cried myself to sleep for about an hour. I told one person. He's no longer a part of my life.",30Sep2019,9

- Complete lack of motivation, which caused me to fail my first year of uni and is still affecting me

- Excessive nervousness, to the point that I can’t even leave my apartment because I’m scared that my neighbours are judging me

- Insomnia, and not being able to get out of bed when I wake up

- Overeating, due to the fact that I eat about a bag of chips a day, and usually finish off a 12 pack of soda in just a few days

- Convinced that everyone in my life doesn’t like me, even though I know it’s not true. This causes me not to talk to people for months at a time

I feel like there's something wrong with me as a person and I don't really want to talk to a professional about it because I just don't like talking therapists. Ever since I was 8, I felt like I was a sociopath or mentally ill. My mother was killed by my dad when I was 8 just two days after my birthday and I just remember that whole time frame as a blur. When my grandmother first told me my mom was gone I thought she was kidding and I didn't believe her but then it sunk in and all I felt or thought was ""wow so that happened"". Throughout that whole time I did not cry, not even at the funeral and I still don't cry now when I think about her. It's just a fleeting thought in my mind now that she's dead and that it happened. I've had some rough moments throughout my life like fighting with my brother or being losing friends and family members here and there but whenever something bad happens like a relative dying or a friend in need I can't sympathize with them. I feel nothing and I feel kind of bad because of that. I'm a female and 18 y.o now and I have a boyfriend. I don't have any romantic feelings for him but I feel like I need to demonstrate ""acts of love"" towards him, I'm not even sexually attracted towards him. It's been like with every guy I've ever dated for a long time and frankly I scare myself. I don't have violent urges and if I'm angry I just like to be by myself in silence or think about going to some other place.

Hello, so I have been diagnosed with depression 6 months ago but I had been feeling depressed about 1-1.5 years before that as well. In my case, depression is present along with dissociation disorder and because of that I always used to be uninterested in everything. However, these days it has become really bad. It's like I am living in another world and my body acts on autopilot. I do everything that I would normally do without my mind being there. Does that make sense?

On another note, I am very influenced by Japanese anime, manga, all of that. My goal before things got this bad was to learn all the Jouyou kanji so that I can read manga and light novels without english translations and I was very passionate about it.

But I don't feel anything about it anymore. I still want to read manga in Japanese of course but I can't muster up the strength to study the kanji. It's not laziness, I assure you.

Can someone help me with this? I really need to get back in my daily routine as fast as I can but I feel as if I'm at a dead end",30Sep2019,1
81,"I'm new here. Been dealing with some mental health issues for a couple years. Can't sleep tonight, starting writing down my thoughts in a note on my phone.  I'm scared of where I feel like I'm headed. Any advice from people who've gone through similar situations would be appreciated:

I have been having a very difficult time lately. My mental health is quite possibly at an all time low. I've had 2 sessions with a therapist, and they are going alright but I only feel like I am falling more off the rails. I want to talk to my mom about it, but she is hours away and I can't go down there, I really wish I could. Everytime she asks me how I am doing I lie, and tell her I'm doing well, things are getting better. 
I don't want her to worry about me. She has enough going on. I don't want to talk to any of my friends about it, all they know is that I've been having appointments, I don't want them to think differently of me or look down on me. 
The past couple of weeks have been the worst. I've always known that I needed to seek help, but I've always been scared of what they are going to say is wrong with me. I always thought it would be worse than Anxiety and Depression, but still I feel hopeless. Like I'm not going to be able to get through it. Like I can't talk about it with people because I can't gather the strength to start the conversation. 
I've never liked asking people for help, I want to be strong enough to get through it alone....but I've been missing work, locking myself in my room, and getting angry at anybody that tries to come in. I'm on a downward spiral and it's out of control, but I don't have the strength to pull myself back up. It's 3:46AM and I've been trying to fall asleep for hours.

I have a real hard time to connect with them or join a conversation i just stay there listen or stay on my phone, anxious dissociating and hating the present moment.

But the moment i leave them and go back home i immediately feel good again and start to smile thinking of funny things that happened and watching photos of those moments

I started taking a lot of photos of those moments because of that, it's like i can't live the present moment fully so i take pictures so i don't forget i was there

It's very strange to say ""ok i'm going to force myself to go to this event, i'm going to hate myself there but it'll feel good afterward"" i don't think it's a healthy way of thinking haha (even though it would be more toxic if i never go out at all)

87,"I've been wondering about this topic for a while ever since I realized a few things about myself. I feel like there's something wrong with me as a person and I don't really want to talk to a professional about it because I just don't like talking therapists. Ever since I was 8, I felt like I was a sociopath or mentally ill. My mother was killed by my dad when I was 8 just two days after my birthday and I just remember that whole time frame as a blur. When my grandmother first told me my mom was gone I thought she was kidding and I didn't believe her but then it sunk in and all I felt or thought was ""wow so that happened"". Throughout that whole time I did not cry, not even at the funeral and I still don't cry now when I think about her. It's just a fleeting thought in my mind now that she's dead and that it happened. I've had some rough moments throughout my life like fighting with my brother or being losing friends and family members here and there but whenever something bad happens like a relative dying or a friend in need I can't sympathize with them. I feel nothing and I feel kind of bad because of that. I'm a female and 18 y.o now and I have a boyfriend. I don't have any romantic feelings for him but I feel like I need to demonstrate ""acts of love"" towards him, I'm not even sexually attracted towards him. It's been like with every guy I've ever dated for a long time and frankly I scare myself. I don't have violent urges and if I'm angry I just like to be by myself in silence or think about going to some other place. I don't know of it's weird to thinki about things the way I do or why I'm so calm about stuff most of the time but I feel like weirdo and I want to end my worries. What do I do?",30Sep2019,2

I feel like this is something that should of been started a long time ago. they did an assessment and diagnosis and found something that wasn't full on depression? I don't remember what the exact name of it was, but it was something related to depression. They gave me medication for it.

90,"Good morning all,

So glad to say I’ve not been on here much lately as i feel I’m doing really well with my anxiety and thoughts but I have a question. My girlfriends father had schizophrenia when he was 28 and sadly passed away when he was 31 but I know it says it runs in families but I’m seeing mixed reviews online about this. My girlfriend is a normal girl who lives a good healthy and fun life but she has never questioned “what if I get this” well not to me anyways. She never really talks about her dad but my question is is she guaranteed to get this when she is older? My girlfriend is 21 and only suffers from a little bit of anxiety now and then but nothing more a few low moods now and then but on medication for it. I have heard that chances are still very low to nil for someone with a parent having the illness but it’s now making me worry about it and I have heard that you’d notice signs especially in someone you love and I’ll be honest I see no signs. Am I just worrying over nothing?

Thanks

all she wants is me dead and i know I'm a strong person but depression with schizophrenia is really hard to live with 😭, around 10:00pm last night i was having really great conversations with her she was telling me laughable jokes and sometimes demanding at getting me to do things i didn't feel like doing. 

Now you may think I'm crazy by laughing at myself even though their isent anythink their in reality but to me schizophrenia is ""REAL"" you see, hear, taste, touch, and smell things. it's a long term mental disorder of a type involving a breakdown in relation between thought, emotion, and behaviour. leading to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings. withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusions, and a sense of mental fragmentation.

93,"I had misdiagnosed tuberculosis for 6 months due to incorrect report. When I was finally diagnosed it was at a pretty advanced stage and I just got lucky that I got cured. What keeps bothering me is that my dad had tuberculosis when he was younger and he recognised all my symptoms as TB but still kept quiet about it and kept enforcing a bed time  and diet on me. My family physician also misdiagnosed it as bronchitis. When I was extremely weak after losing 11 kgs in 6 months, and decided to check with another doctor, my dad was against the idea as well. I ignored him as visited another doctor to finally get my diagnosis. During the treatment he was fully skeptical of my doctor.

My dad has had anxiety issues all his life and has had panic attack once. He never checks with a doctor for any of his illnesses. He made my home environment very toxic because of his uncontrolled anxiety and anger issues. I don't believe that he wanted me to die or anything but just cannot understand what made him go silent, like that. When i try to confront him about it, he starts streaming and puts the blame on me, that I am the only one responsible for myself. But in reality, both my parents are very controlling and never let me act independently. They throw a fit when I make my own choices. Both of them had difficult childhoods.

98,"Hey guys I'm looking for some advise or something to help me in my current mental health situation. 

Long story short about 4 months ago (coming onto 5months) I was on my way home from a friend's house on a Friday night. It was quite late about 11:30pm I was walking home and I ended up getting beaten up and robbed for my belongings. 

I know that it was kinda my fault walking home alone that late anything could of happened unfortunately something did this time. I have been seeing a psychologist as I still have PTSD from the incidence it only comes up when I'm outside and when cars drive pass me at night. 

I'm not 100% sure if I am in the right place or is this should be /r/legaladvise. (I am sorry if I have posted in the wrong place)

After a few session with my psychologist she has been giving me exercises to help challenge my PTSD and my stuck points, With these exercises it has brought up more passed emotions/feelings &amp; events in my life I had put behind me. I understand it's not good to block these things out as it could cause later problems down the line.  

My hardest point now trying to deal with this is my work. I'm currently employed under Department of human services working for a 3rd party company. I work in a very stressful environment dealing with all sorts of calls, due to the nature of my work I am unable to give out to much detail in what I do this is for Australian Department of human services.  

The work can be very stressful and abusive at points. Not all the time, but it does have to do with the demographic of people(customers) I deal with. It can be anywhere between Family and domestic violence to a general question. 

With what I have gone through and having all my passed events, thoughts and emotions coming back up I feel like my work is going to break me (mentally) there's no other position in my work that I can move to and I have already had some time off to try recover. 

I am alone most of the time I do try go out and see friend hoping to lighten my mood and move my thoughts across to more positive thoughts. But what is hanging on me and what is pushing my to my breaking point is the worry that I might lose/leave my job. 

I know it's not good to block out thoughts and emotions but does anyone here have any sort of technique or way of completely blocking out my negative thoughts to help get by my Job? I like to always do a good job at my work and do the best to my ability, I break down crying before I start my work I hold it back during my work and it breaks me again after work. 

If I was financially stable I would of left and found something that doesn't destroy my mental health. I can't just leave my job I'm worried I'm going to snap soon and wreck my future. I feel like I'm bragging on and to myself I don't even know what I'm asking for I'm really just lost at the moment and scared I'll do something stupid.",30Sep2019,2

At one point I smashed my forehead against the door of my closet that resulted in it shaking and me feeling dizzy afterwards(only for a few moments).
Since that day I can't really seem to think right or deeply enough e.g. follow through a thought.
I can still do my homework and stuff with not much of a problem but I just don't feel like I could think like I used to.
For example,  before the that day,  I had a passion for learning web development and other stuff, made plans etc and also had an interests but since then I lost all those interests.
I have also started to hit my forehead with my hand just reassure myself that it wasn't a big deal but then get into the paranoia that I might've worsened it(im paranoid that I might've got brain damage on my frontal cortex that explains why I'm like that now).
So my main concern is that if I have any sort of brain damage or mental health problem because I just can't seem to understand what's wrong with me.
Back at the problem of thinking,  I can't seem to really understand/think anything deeply for example at school since when I start to and reach a point,  I just can't think any more. Also can't think of the future or past as well,  I mean , I can recall my past but not really process it.

110,"First I want to say how deep I am currently in with my depression/suicidal ideation. I’m looking for a sliver of hope, or some ideas of how better to cope with my current situation. Please be kind.

I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for most my life. I’m in my early 30’s now. Since being married to my husband, depression has gotten beyond debilitating. I’ve lost all hope and I don’t know what to do. I have children, so it adds an enormous amount of guilt when I consider killing myself. (I have tried therapy, medications, and am currently in between treatments.)

I understand how frustrating and upsetting it can be for spouses who are married/in relationships with people who deal with depression, but it has gotten incredibly worse since being married. Before, I was able to function, keep a job, not stay in bed for more than half a day...but now I’m left feeling completely empty and heavy. It’s a vicious cycle of guilt and depression and I don’t know how much more I can take. 

When I get taken over by my depression, and it keeps me debilitated in my bed, my husband will say the most hurtful things to me most of the time. Sometimes he is nice and shows empathy, but when he hurts me, it tears through my soul. I’ve expressed to him many times that guilt affects me deeply and worsens my depression very much. When he says or does these things to me, I feel like I’m out of my body. I feel numb...too hurt to even cry. Sometimes though, it has gotten to a point where I have so much resentment and anger built up inside me, that I lash out and call him every name in the book, or break his things. I’ll list some examples later on so you get an idea of what I’m talking about, but I guess I wrote this up hoping for some direction, hope, advice, or just to have someone hear me out. I have no idea which way to turn so until then I am debilitated to my bed, staring at the ceiling waiting for the sweet relief of sleep to wash over me for as long as it lets me.

Examples:

-making fun of me for being in bed for days, to the point where my kids have started making it the butt of jokes in-front of family members, and at home.

-my husband has hurt my feelings a handful of times by making sarcastic and belittling jokes about my depression in front of a group of people, even after I have talked to him about it and told him how embarrassed it made me.

-telling me he refuses to have anymore children with me because “it doesn’t seem like I even like being a parent, I don’t teach them much, I don’t pack there lunches when I’m stuck in bed,etc”

-making me feel guilty for having to take medical leave due to my inability to function caused by depression, while patting himself constantly on the back for “not letting anything get in the way of his going to work full time”

-getting physically in my face and yelling when I’m really low and hiding under my covers telling me how awful of an example I am for the kids, how he has to take the brunt of the work around the house when I get this way, and how I need to just “get up” (like it’s so easy to do when you’re paralyzed by such a god awful illness).

-exposed my most personal information regarding my depression and anxiety that  I had shared with him to all of my family and his after me making it incredibly clear that what I go through and do/say needs to stay between me and him.(no it wasn’t because of self harm or threats of)

-taking away all my personal items (phone, laptop, apple watch, medications, etc) when he gets frustrated by my depressive episodes.

-calling me names and saying hurtful things such as; psycho, fucked up in the brain, horrible mom, lazy..

this list could go on and on but I’m just exhausted and at the end of my rope.  I have nobody to turn to because nobody believes me since he is such a good father and such a “great and supportive husband” on the outside. He truly is a great father to the kids, but he knows I love my kids more than my heart can handle. The reason I’ve even gotten to the point of suicide is because I don’t even care to leave my kids behind, as I’m such a horrible mom to them anyways...they deserve better and I know this. (I’ve never hurt them in any way, but I have missed waking up on time to take them to school, things like that.

I also found it hard to get used to college because I felt inferior to my classmates since they all had previous experience related to our major, while I had to start learning everything from zero.

However, even though college was hard, I still managed to be a top student, but I noticed that I started getting lazier and lazier on my junior year. I would feel very stressed about the assignments, but I would procrastinate until the last minute.

I am currently living abroad, where I recently got my bachelor's degree. Since I got my diploma, all I do is sleep late and wake up late. My daily life since then just involves having dinner and procrastinating online.

Today waking up nauseous as hell, been to work and had a panic attack around noon. Cold sweat, hand shaking, can’t breathe. Back then I was like what the fuck is happening to me. I had coffee so that might made it worse.

After work now back to the high stage, ate a lot again and now nauseous as hell again. Now I’m legit so hyperactive, so happy? So hyped so high to a point I’m having headache and want to throw up so bad. I’m not drinking anything or smoking anything. I only had a really weak coffee today.

I feel like I’m dying. Sorry for the messy writing I have no idea what’s going on right now my thoughts are all over the place.

121,"Lately I’ve been struggling so much with anxiety and misophonia that I can’t manage school which is making me depression and even more anxious. We’ve decided it’s best if I go get admitted once again. Except it’s been almost 2 years since I last went and I feel like a failure. They only have 16 beds at the hospital and they are completely full so we have to go in and see if there is any discharges today. I feel like I’m not sick enough to be in the hospital but I also feel like I need it. I’m scared I’m taking the spot (that is, is they even have one for me) from someone who is struggling more. I just don’t know what to do. I doubt they will admit me but I don’t know what I would do if they don’t. I need help and I want to be honest with them (that I’m not suicidal, if I go home I won’t kill myself, etc) but I also feel like telling the truth will make them think I’m fine and don’t need to be in the hospital. I feel so stuck. And the psych ER is a SCARY place. I’ve had a lot of bad experiences then and I basically have to sit in a TINY waiting room with mostly adults, not kids, for anywhere from 5-20+ hours. I’m dreading it but I want help.

Or like to bail something down I’ll pretend to describe it to someone, like the other day I had a paper due on the differences between Noh and Kyogen theatres and so I was like “well Noh typically features these kinds of things, and this differs to Kyogen which features this. But they do have some things in common like that.” The only part that kinda makes me think it’s strange is sometimes I’ll just go on a rant, just talking. Not for any reason, I’ll just be watching a movie and pause it to be like “oh I like that, that reminds me of this” and then I’ll just be talking aloud for 10 minutes of various things and then it’s like I hit a wall where I’m satisfied and I just stop. I don’t ever do it in public and I’m in control of it, I can stop whenever I want/need to, but it just feels good.

I went up to him without shoes and he got upset, I was trying to help him with his radio and he got upset, I folded his clothes and put them away but instead of a thank you he goes “I bet you mixed some of my clothes together”. I know he’s going through a tough time right now and there’s some things that he’s going through that he doesn’t want to say but what I don’t understand is that he won’t spend time with me. He’s not affectionate with me, he gets annoyed over everything I do, he always wants to be with his friends, he ignores my texts and texts everyone else yet he says he’s busy. I needed him to pick me up from some where cuz I didn’t have anyone to give me a ride and he was online ignoring my calls ending them and ignoring my texts. When I confront him about it he gets so angry and annoyed and won’t talk. I guess my question is, if someone has anger issues do they tend to put it all on the significant other when they’re in a relationship? He treats everyone normal but it seems like he’s out to get me when I’m just trying to put a smile on his face. I know nothing about having anger issues or anything like that.

130,"The past couple of days have been pretty surreal. On Friday afternoon I had a very important meeting at work. I woke up in the morning and all of a sudden my phone started behaving super weirdly (it would volume up/down by itself, open apps by itself, activate power off by itself all the time, it was acting crazy). The phone was unusable. I had to go to Apple to get it fixed, and by the time I was done and was able to get to work I found out my meeting had been moved (they called me, but since my phone was out of commission I missed their call) and I had missed the meeting. In the afternoon I get a fraud alert call from my credit card company, which takes almost 3 hours to deal with. I got kind of paranoid that my phone had been hacked and that’s how they got my credit card info, so I decided to check my bank to see if there has been any suspicious activity. I couldn’t login to the bank account, was not getting the codes they sent to reset the password, etc etc. My boss comes into my office so I have to get back to work without solving this. Then Saturday morning I was scheduled to move in to a new apartment. Everything is packed, moving company was on its way to my old apartment to get my furniture, and for some reason I decide that I just have to drive to my new apartment to drop some of the small suitcases (so the moving company wouldn’t waste a bunch of time moving small things that I could easily fit in my car). I get to my new apartment and find the bathroom ceiling has collapsed. I have to cancel everything and the apartment management is not responsive. I have to go back to my ex’s apartment until I get a response from management. Then this morning I go to the DMV to renew my drivers license and find that I have lost my old drivers license, and since it was an out of state license I cannot renew my license today. Then I get a fraud alert on my debit card this time, and find that nearly $1000 have been withdrawn from my account. Another hour spent locking the account and solving the issue. 

I mean... wtf is happening? I’m exhausted. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. I’m exhausted.

I'm done with my life. Even if im making progress with it, I'm done with my sexuality. As you look through my history you can see that it troubles me the most. And the vast majority of people don't understand it and don't want to.

I could be having a great day, until my sexuality pops up again in my head. Then it just fucks me over.

I hate how I'm never going to find someone, that I'll be alone forever. I deserve it anyways. I hate how i get scrutinised for not liking dick like its a sin. I hate how i will never have the family life i want, of a biological child, birthed by my partner or vise versa. I will never see a baby that is ours. I hate how i will always be seen as something off, something that shouldn't be there. And i shouldn't exist. I'm not supposed to like women, it makes no sense at all.

132,"I’m a 32Yo female and I’ve had anxiety my whole life. I have had a few “episodes” where my anxiety seems to spiral out of control for a few months here and there without anything in my life that is actually causing the anxiety. Usually I go to my dr and get a prescription for an SSRI/SNRI (the only ones she will prescribe) and once it doesn’t work out for me I stop taking it due to whatever side effects (with the ok from my dr, I don’t just do it alone) and just deal with the anxiety and eventually it goes away. 

Anyway, recently my anxiety got really bad and I began to have panic attacks. They aren’t triggered by anything I can identity yet, and so I went to my dr and she prescribed a new medicine cymbalta. 
I took cymbalta for 2 weeks but never got over the vomiting and once I stopped being able to have any sexual feelings, I called my dr and I decided to stop. She prescribed me another med but it’s in the same family and I tried it before with my old dr and I’m tired of trying meds so I haven’t filled it yet (my dr also knows this). 

So I stopped taking it a week ago, and then the past 3 days I have had some weird things happening, like de ja by but instead a full memory. Sometimes I’ll see something like a chair I’ve never seen before and have a memory of that chair being on fire and having to douse it with a fire extinguisher. I remember it so vividly that I can feel the push back from the extinguisher, hear the sound, feel the chill from the extinguisher and the heat from the flames. Except that chair is fine and I’ve never seen it before so obviously it was never on fire and I didn’t put it out. It feels like I’m recalling a dream, except it can be with something I’ve never seen before so I couldn’t have dreamt it. 
It’s also happened to me where I’ve done things at night and not remembered. Such as I found something I placed near the sink that I haven’t used/touched in weeks. My partner is a light sleeper and says I’m not sleep walking. 
I also had a dream where Jesus spoke to me (I’m not religious) and I honestly thought i was remembering a true event except I realized that it happened in the daytime and the only time I had been to that location where the dream took place was in the evening. 

Is this some weird side effect from going off meds even though I only took them for two weeks? Or am I starting to hallucinate? These aren’t the only two examples, they are just the only ones I can really describe.",30Sep2019,1

Ultimately, it got so bad i couldn't answer my work or cell phone without having a full on anxiety attack (didn't matter who was calling). To sum it up,  I ended up going to the hospital twice for severe anxiety attacks, being committed to a psych hospital, losing my job, and subsequently my health insurance. I was supposed to see a new psychologist today. For obvious reasons, I won't be. The people closest can't comprehend the impact this is having on my life.

OCD is a bully in your brain. It is going to spend time finding your vulnerabilities and seeing how it can attack. The intrusive thought tells you a lie that you want to quickly defend.

144,"I don't believe that. It's very hard to believe that. I've struggled with attending school for about 3 years now due to my mental health. It got to the point where I missed so much school that I had to test out of high school and move on with my life. I am not getting a proper senior year like all of my friends currently are and I'm in college. Head start. That's the perk. 

They say that you need to focus on helping yourself but in all honesty, you need to find a way to help yourself and somehow find a way to stay on top of everything. You have extra pressure. You need to find help and still do what other students are expected to do. Sure, there's programs that your school can put you in to give you leeway and help a bit but ultimately, a teacher can't give you different tests or anything. You still need to know everything. 

I don't know why I'm ranting. I guess I just wanted to talk about this because I can feel myself slipping and the last thing I want is to have a major breakdown in college that'll slow me down. It's getting to the point where I feel like a hospitalization may help but I don't want to let myself do that because I'd go crazy thinking about all that I'm missing. I'm still 17 so at the hospital I've gone to various times before, we aren't allowed to really do homework and think about school. I don't know what it's like in the adult unit but I know the adolescent unit very well. I just feel like I am not allowed to truly help myself in the way I need because life doesn't stop moving even when you need a break.

145,"At the hospital I've usually gone to, I've only ever been in the adolescent unit. It ranges in age from 13-17. The rule is so rigid that they have straight up told us that they have woken people up at midnight on their 18th birthday to get all their stuff and move them down to the adult unit. It's what is required by the law.

Anyone who's seen what it's like in an adult unit may know that it's a completely different ball game. Way different than what it's like in an adolescent unit. I just don't think it's helpful to push people into such an environment so suddenly. When I was 15 (17 now) I used to be so scared of ending up there close to my 18th birthday. I used to wish there was such a thing as a young adult section. I still kind of wish that was a thing, as I'm nearing my 18th birthday. My birthday is in March. I just feel like young adults would relate to each other better in a unit. I don't think it's right to put 18 year olds with every other adult age range. The law says that we're adults at 18 but that doesn't automatically mean we fit in well with 30 year olds, for example.",30Sep2019,1
146,"I had a lot of issues in years past with emotions. I kept them repressed for a very long time, and only really started confronting them about 2 1/2 years ago. And the thing that has caused me the most personal trouble is empathy. Sure, if I see a friend of mine is hurt or in a bad situation, I recognize it is a bad situation and want to help them out of it so they are not suffering, but I myself do not feel sad that they are in that position. And it's worse for positive emotions. When my friends, people I love and would give my life for, are doing well in life, it makes me mad. I want to be happy for them, but I can't. The only emotion I feel is either jealousy that they are doing well and I am not, rage that they are succeeding without me, or sadness that I am falling behind in life. The voice in my head tells me that I am a failure, or that they have betrayed me, because they have managed to find happiness without me.

I hate that my mind does this, I hate it so much. It makes me feel like I am a sociopath, like I am a fundamentally bad person. It keeps me from hanging out with a lot of my friends because they have relationships and I don't, and it hurts me to see them having that special something in their life that I don't. And I don't want to feel that way. I'm tired of not being able to hand out with my best friend because she has a significant other and I shut down whenever I even hear his name mentioned. Having a relationship would probably help me to be happy, I do want to find someone to share my life with, but I know it's a bad idea to go into something like that if you don't have proper control over your own head, and this is a major issue.

And it's not that I can't feel positive emotions, it's that they are all internalized. I feel for myself, but I cannot feel for others, and I want to but I do not know. Has anyone heard of anything like this and how it may be addressed?",30Sep2019,1

148,"For a while now I’ve had an issue with involuntary movement and saying things out loud that I don’t mean to. They’re like impulsive actions that my brain decides to do that happen faster than I have the chance to stop. I never paid them much mind because I could usually suppress them when I had to and they’d mostly happen when I was alone. Recently though they’ve been changing and becoming more frequent when I’m out around people. My most frequent ones are a soft grunt with an exhale, a sharp inhale through my nose while flinching foreword and slamming my hand on a table if I’m sitting. I’ve also been having a lot more stress lately and I think this might be linked. Is there a possibility I’m psyching myself out and convincing myself I have a tic disorder when I really don’t? I’ve tried telling myself that I don’t but that hasn’t done much. Has anyone else experienced this?",30Sep2019,1
149,"I realize that I've not contributed to this sub and I really only found it so that I could post my 'suffering' so I want to first apologize for that.  I hope that I can provide some helpful feedback in the future.  But I'll be honest, it's hard to read about others' struggles when you feel you're just crawling out of the hole and are afraid you'll fall back in.  Anyway...

I have recently had to second guess my own brain; namely, my perception of events, people's intentions, etc.  And that is really unsettling news because (a) if you can't rely on your own mind, what are you supposed to trust?; and (b) I'm middle aged and am far more aware of the chances of shit going sideways at this age.  Oddly enough, I think it was my legal background that actually led me to consider my perceptions objectively.

Here's the bad part.  I have everything that I could ever want - beautiful family, home, job, salary, free time - and I'm depressed most of the time.  And then I feel guilty about being so privileged and feeling like I need more.  I grew up in a crazy world with parental abandonment, bullying, a mentally ill parent, physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, the latter by a stranger my parent left me in the custody of who lived across the school and was a pedophile who had served time!  

I constantly dicker between adopting the stiff upper lip approach or trying to dig in and reconcile the past.  I have a contempt for the thought of considering myself a ""victim"" or ""survivor"".  So far I haven't found a therapist who is able to challenge me and forge that trust. I've tried a lot of counselling in the past so know the approaches well.  I know that exercise seems to work wonders for me but I can't get my ass to the gym these last 2 years.

My depression/mind state manifests in anxiety.  And my response to anxiety is to be physical.  I have had several run ins with the police recently for investigations of assault.  All willing participants I should add but not a good pattern.  Recently I had a run in with a police officer who briefly put his hands on me when I was upset and it was all I could do to not hit him.  I mean, that would have been the end of it right there.  The consequences would have been catastrophic.  But in those conditions, I can't think of anything other than violence. And my perception, distorted or not, is all about being disrespected, insulted, picked on, bullied and it's a trigger that is going to eventually get me jailed.  

My doctor has me on all sorts of medication: depression, anxiety, etc.  I smoke a lot of cannabis because I feel like it brings me down a notch; I'm not certain that is in fact true. If anybody reads this and says, ""hey, this sounds familiar"", I would appreciate a holler so I know there's one other person out there.

Thanks for listening.",30Sep2019,1

But the feeling of darkness and despair still came back to haunt me on darker days. Ive never been the same ever since that day. I never got to continue therapy as my parents refuse to help me out. Ive tried talking to the school councelor but i just cant bring myself to confess that i am still suicidal. Recently i broke up with my only ray of hope i still had. My girlfriend. And it was all my fault. I could go and blame my mental illness and what not. But that wont bring her back. I failed. I fucked up. And now im left with nothing. The same feeling of despair from the day i attempted to take my own life came crashing down back into me. Im trying my best, i really am. But if this goes on. I dont feel like ill even make it to christmas. I feel like this is the end of the road for me. And as much as id want to fight and keep going...i just dont feel like it.",30Sep2019,1

152,"I think I’m starting to not be okay. Not going to hurt myself or anything, but just sliding back into mental health issues. 

I work full time. It has also been uncharacteristically busy and not only are we understaffed, but a couple people do the bare minimum of what you could call “working”. Management is not doing anything about it. To top it all off, I’m training someone. 

I am in school part time. One is s 300-level class. Even though it is an undergrad class, there are graduate students. They are so smart that I am too scared to comment on anything, which is going to bring down my grade. I need my grade point average above 3.0 when I graduate. It’s around a 2.5. I want to eventually get into a DPT program someday. 

The reading load is insane. I read on my commute. I try to read at work. I read at home. I brought down my gym time from 5 days to 3. I know most people don’t think this is a big deal, but I *love love* the gym. I miss it. 

I am starting to have trouble sleeping. I am at the point of being exhausted each night and can’t turn my mind off. I listen to sleep stories to turn my mind off. It usually takes 1. Last night it took 3. 

I am beginning to feel bored by most things and I have to make myself do things I normally would not have any trouble doing. I got put my depression light. The seasons are changing and at the very least it will hopefully just reinforce my circadian rhythm to help me sleep. 

I can barely get my shit together to make food for myself. I used meal plan and now that seems to be done. 

I keep think about how Thursday starts week 4 out of 10 for school so I’m almost half way done. But I feel like me holding everything together was very fragile and I keep getting things thrown at it to knock it down. If that makes any sense.

It doesn't help that a week ago my 2 best friends moved to live in another country and even though I have other friends and my parents I feel alone. I don't want to talk to anyone of the fact that sometimes I miss my ex because I'm too proud to admit that in person and the only people I would tell are far away now. I'm rarely in the mood to study to get my bachelor degree and I get even sadder when I see other people finishing their studies. I know I should get my s\*\*t together and study but I end up doing something else like playing videogames or wasting time watching random videos. Working out helps a little bit because I like the way my body looks now and in the past I was very self conscious about that (I was skinny and had bad posture). So there is that.

157,"So I've just stumbled upon a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lPUnWcmR9U) by Alex Becker (CEO of Market Builder) that has really resonated with me and brought me back down to earth. Alex goes on to explain an experience he had while playing World of Warcraft - he had a brief thought of quitting his job to play video games. This shocked him and made him question why he even had that thought. He wondered why he would even think of abandoning his successful business that he enjoyed working for so long. Over the 3 weeks that he played WoW, he began associating his job with ""*boredom*"", and WoW as ""*fun*"". 

This prompted him to take a step back and recognize what was happening. He then goes on to explain how the human brain seeks dopamine releases, and favours quick access with minimal pain required to get it. Then he lists ""micro-addictions"" that do exactly that; smartphones, video games, social media, junk food, drinking, etc.

And then I realized that he was describing me. I'm a 22 year old university student and I'm exhausted. I'm constantly depressed, losing interest in what I'm doing, worried about my future, procrastinating. Meanwhile, I indulge in all of the dopamine shortcuts that he listed. **This is not how I should be.**

To give some context, I was pushed as a child to always go 100%, specifically in school. I had straight A's my whole life. I played sports. I was social. I was well rounded. I loved video games, technology, science. I was very confident and saw a bright future ahead. I had no doubts. I was a hard working kid. 

Flash forward to college (moving away from home), I put a lot of hours into video games. Not absurd amounts, but probably a bit too much (2-5 hours a night). On top of this, I don't eat very well, and I obviously use my phone as much as the next person... Then school started getting hard. If I were my 16 y/o self, I'd say, ""bring it"". But now I'm a mess. An absolute mess. Lost all of my confidence. More than half the time I'm bawling myself to sleep. School has become a dreadful job, when it used to be a welcomed challenge. Video games are now my primary source of relief. I'm way off track. And the worst part, I'm privileged *(god I hate that word).* My parents help me financially, I face no ethnic hardships, I really **should not complain**, yet I'm somehow depressed.

Apologies for the rant, but long story short, Alex recommends cutting these micro-addictions out of your life to re-wire your brain into doing productive things for dopamine, rather than the shortcuts. I really suggest you take the time to watch the video (at least 10 or so minutes of it to get the idea). Is he right? Has anyone followed through with this mindset to achieve positive results? I'm very interested. Even though the foundation of my life was built on video games - if I have to cut it out to stop this living hell, I will.",30Sep2019,3

my team in the UK used to bully me.

They used to tell me to be religious. i hate religion, so i won't ever be such.

they used to tell me not to have tattoos. sorry, many have them. why single me out?

they used to tell me to not go to bars and get drunk. many others do it - so why single me out?

they used to tell me that i ""looked smart"" and should ""help the world"" - what?! what does that even mean? why does somebody who ""looks smart"" ""help"" anybody else?

they told me I couldn't go to university since i ""couldn't hack it"". well many go to university, so why not me? is there a reason?

they clearly thought I was some kind of person based on some stereotype. sorry, but how I behaved and still behave is the same as many others. so judge me on the ""Normal"" type, not what you ""think"" I am.

My Best friend has his own bag of mental problems, I always try to listen and support even when not in best of mental states. But I cannot do it 24/7, especially when am having a brake down and they just change the topic to be about their problems and them needing help.

Same goes to internet people, who say ""y'all are loved"", the minority communities who say they will support you in any matter.

171,"Dear Reddit Users,

Lately, I have been experiencing feelings of fatigue that are inhibiting me from feeling or acting like a semi-functional human. I drag myself out of bed to make it to classes (most of the time), both of my two jobs, and then crawl back home to curl into bed each night. Taking a shower has even gotten to point where it feels like a chore. My willpower to complete assignments is dwindling down to nothing, as is my ability to keep face at my jobs. I leave my apartment each morning and will not return for another 12-15 hours at least on somedays. I have so many ideas and goals, but it feels like I have all but completely lost myself in the stress of my everyday life. Some background on me would be that I have struggled with feelings of depression and anxiety since I was a young teenager, and am now in my early twenties. With that being said, for a long time I was really able to strive in my stress. For years I worked these same type of schedules while completing my Associates, but now as I am on the cusp of receiving my Bachelor's degree I feel out of place and seem to question everything I have come to. I have recently changed my major plan, but I am still questioning my ability to complete this path I have started. As I did with my original major plan. It's a disappointing feeling when you put so much time and money into your schooling only to realize later that you are not where you feel you should be. I find myself working so much that weeks will pass me by before I realize how long it has been since I have seen friends and family members. As of right now, it really feels like I am doing all of this work and the only results I am obtaining are dramatic hits to my mental health.

I do not want to spend my hours laying in bed feeling unable to move anymore. My new response to stress has become an overwhelming feeling of sleepiness and numbness. I want to learn how to strive in my stress, not drown in it. This isn't something that friends, family, or coworkers seem to understand, no matter how I try to explain it to them. I feel like I come off as lazy or whiny when I do try to share this feeling with others. I love to exercise, read, cook, spend time with friends and family... As of lately, though, these things I have always loved feel a million miles away. As does finding the will to find those pieces of myself again.

I want to rediscover my motivation to take care of myself again... My motivation to work towards the goals I have set in place for myself. The motivation to feel healthy and happy again, instead of feeling isolated and numb. So I am posting on here in hopes of finding other individuals that have experienced and overcome this kind of mentality/state of being. Any advice on how some of you have overcome feelings similar to this would be much appreciated.

Thank you,

M",30Sep2019,1

I’m 22 years old and as far as I can remember I’ve always been an emotional dude, even in highschool when my parents would gets on to me about grades, sports, etc. I’d cry about it later on because it made me sad. But lately I don’t know if I feel much of anything, there is NOTHING wrong in my world rn, I live with my three best friends in a bachelor pad type house while two of them are in college, I work and make pretty decent money, I’m close with both my parents and my brother and sister we all get along and I even have a beautiful gf of almost two years who would do anything for me.

I’ve been always considered to be a caring person to everyone around me I even have been know to buy a homeless person a meal everytime a see a person in need.

173,"Before my CPN discharged me, we spoke about my weight again. I have lost half a stone. Putting me at 5 and a half stone. I'm usually between 6 and 6 and a half, and still underweight but it's my stable zone. Not healthy, but I function well 

She said she wanted to have my bloods done, heart checked etc. All the typical tests for anorexia before I was discharged. Because I had been having palpatations. But as with every other thing she suggested, it just got left and ignored. A month past and I get discharged.  

Thankfully I had a health check due with my GP. The health check brought up concerns with blood in my urine. 

My first health check was with the nurse who just asked me how much I weighed, even though the scales were right there. Along with knowing I have an eating disorder, I just find this a little bit stupid if I'm honest. At a health check it is part of the procedure to weigh the patient. Especially if they are known to have issues with their weight!

My follow up appointment with the actual doctor didnt even entertain my weight and instead seemed to quiz me about whether I knew how and why blood would be in my urine without an infection. Before sending me for bloods. 

Now in the past I have been underweight enough that my organs were ready to shut down and my main symptom was exhaustion. Just wanting to sleep all of the time. 
I wasnt far under the weight I'm currently at. 
I am sleeping as much as I can at the minute. I'm up for a couple of hours and then asleep again. This repeats all day. Every day.

It is absolutely baffling me that my weight is being ignored through all of this. I expressed my concerns to my doctor that I'm worried it's my kidneys due to my weight and he just nodded that it could be. Still not weighing me.
I'm still sat here left not knowing what is what while I wait for the doctor to check my blood test results.

It's doing my head in.

I have never gone to a Dr for this before &amp; I have been able to calm myself down &amp; relax before but for some reason this time around I physically feel sick and no matter what I do I just constantly feel on edge and I also cant sleep. I also dont want to be prescribed xans or anything because I just dont want to be on them. Any opinion is appreciated,  21 I live in florida.",30Sep2019,2
181,"So for the past five years (16 M) I’ve been unbelievably depressed and anxious, and sometimes it gets so bad that I have psychotic episodes where I will literally start hallucinating and passing out. But every time this happens, I kinda just put it on the back burner of life, because there’s more important things than being sad. Lately though, I’ve been starting to notice health problems on the left side of my body, such as heart pain, loss of vision and drooping in my left eye, and I’m even starting to lose a little bit of hair on the left side. I recently did some thinking during one of my meditation sessions, and I was wondering if, since the left part of your body is controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain, I’m just going through some sort of “mental deprivation” of some sort (I mean, I haven’t been happy at all these past two years especially, I really just sit at home all day and think) and if so, is it bad for my physical health?",30Sep2019,2
182,"Hey everyone, after struggling with anxiety and feelings of inadequacy, I started doing research on how to feel better. As I happen to be working on a startup to help people sleep better ([The Rest](https://www.jointherest.com/)), I was curious about the connection between sleep and mental health. Here are a few interesting things I learned:

1. Staying up late and interrupted sleep can both lead to significantly reduced feelings of positive mood (such as cheerfulness), and significantly increased feelings of negative mood (such as anger), according to research led by [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/sleep_interruptions_worse_for_mood_than_overall_reduced_amount_of_sleep_study_finds).
2. Beyond affecting the strength of our positive and negative moods, sleep deprivation affects the brain’s emotional center (the amygdala) in a way that can lead to greater emotional reactivity and impulsivity, according to research led by [UC Berkeley](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lack-sleep-disrupts-brains-emotional-controls).
3. The connection between sleep and mental health is a two-way street. People under high levels of stress, or with strong stress responses, tend to have sleep problems according to Harvard Medical School’s [Division of Sleep Medicine](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/mood).

Curious to know if anyone else here has noticed a connection between their sleep and mental health?",30Sep2019,3
183,"I’ve been going to therapy for almost a year now but it seems like I’m not doing it right if that makes sense. I had to get a new therapist this year for the new semester since my old one was an intern. I’m trying to make it better than with my last therapist.

184,"Hello everyone. I have never made a long or serious post before, so please bear with me. I am using a throwaway, due to privacy issues. 

I (20F) got out of a long term relationship in June 2019 (4.5 years). I was more or less completely dependent on this person for all of high school, and even lived with him for 2 years (he is a little less than a year younger than me). I relied heavily on housing, meals, and a lot of other things due to issues with my own family but thats irrelevant right now. 

I broke up with him due to being unhappy and trying to find myself. I still stand by this decision and have somewhat began seeing someone new. I moved in with my cousin, where I pay very low rent/mo and I have had a well paying job for half a year now. Well paying for someone my age, at least. 

Unfortunately, I think I may be depressed. I feel like all my time to devoted to work/school. And even then, I am failing one of my favorite classes and am hurting to keep up. My motivation has completely diminished and I assume it is because I feel as if I have been through into the deep end and I do not know how to swim.

I have no clue how to budget money, My registration has gone out on my car but I need to get repairs before it will pass inspection. I am in a very odd situation romantically. I feel as if I have no other hobbies for myself and even if I did, I feel as if I could not truly have space to do them (ex: i love printmaking, but I cannot afford all the supplies I need nor do I truly have space to work). My room is constantly messy, not for any reason other than no motivation to clean. I have realized I am very good at pretending to be happy but constantly fight myself on experiencing the true emotions I know I have. I truly love my job and I truly want to do good in school, but I feel as if my world has been flipped and the one person I feel that I can talk to this about seems to turn it around and talk about himself, no matter what I say. 

I dont know what to do anymore and I am so tired of trying. 

I need advice or something because I am taking out my frustrations on people who do not deserve it and little things set me off constantly. I do not know what I am supposed to do, I feel as if I am totally alone, even though I know I am not. 

Please, any help would be appreciated. 

I know I need to see a therapist eventually, but I cannot afford anything like that now. 

Thank you.",30Sep2019,3
185,"I’m fifteen years old, in my sophomore year of high school. I’m on this forum because I want to discuss all these issues that are bothering me. I’ve had these issues for quite a while now.

I have a fear of being a pedophile, I’m afraid I could be sexually attracted to prepubescent children. ( It’s called POCD). I also have a fear of being gay (bisexual HOCD). And I fear being transgender and maybe I’d be more comfortable as a woman (TOCD). 

In addition to all these OCD intrusive thoughts, I also fear I could have schizophrenia now. Because I do feel like I’m quite delusional. I feel like I experience delusions of grandeur, and feel like maybe I think highly of myself, despite in reality I’m actually an anti social painfully awkward serious ass motha fucka all the time. I feel more important or better than everyone else, I feel more special and unique. I feel like my teachers care so much about me too. I know that this isn’t actually the truth and my mind is just completely fucked with delusions though. The only good thing about these grand delusions is that they give me a shit load of confidence to do things. That’s the best thing about these delusions, but overall I’d like to eliminate them PERMANENTLY. I just want to be like everyone else and not stick out.

I’m really confused with the whole delusional thing because I thought it was maladaptive daydreaming that I had. Because I frequently listen to music on my phone and escape reality. I do it everyday and I do it like 4 or 5 times a day. It just feels good. In my fantasy I have an idealized version of myself that’s attractive and has a good personality and made up friends. I move around in my bed a lot because I try to mimick those movements I’m doing in the daydream, if i get emotional in the daydream I might get watery eyed in real life also. 

Why am I delusional? Why do I experience these fears of being a pedophile and gay and transgender? Why? Why me? Me being born was a fucking huge mistake, my dad should’ve never produced that sperm... Great.. Now I might have schizophrenia when I’m an adult, maybe I’m experiencing early stages of it. But I don’t get any hallucinations or anything so I don’t know. I don’t hear voices or shit like that. OCD intrusive thoughts, social anxiety, paranoia, delusions of grandeur, maybe even depression because I feel sad as fuck all the time. I know everyone gets sad but maybe I’m sad all the time. Dammit, I just want to change. If I could change my ways and be more successful and not feel like utter shit then I will. I just want friends, I have no friends. And the friends I did have were pretty fucking annoying and acted autistic. I’m in special ed and shit. Fuck my life.",30Sep2019,5
186,"I have different thoughts like this when I am daydreaming in class or in the car I always have thought like, what if I throw boiling hot water on my dog, what if I abduct my teacher and tie her up on a chair in an empty room in my house and just keep her there, what if I am a sociopath because I only talk and trust this 1 friend I have, not my other 5 friends. Also when people are nice to me in school which is like everyday I think in my mind I guess you’re not on my kill list. Sometimes I get the urge to squeeze my dog’s face really hard or hit her really hard. Every time I see a large gas truck I always think what if I shoot it with a gun.

187,"I'm scared my partner is about to have a mental break again. Since we've been together, this will be the 2nd or 3rd break she's had so I know what to look for. 

She's been talking to herself (she's saying she is talking out loud answering her own questions). She is thinking I am cheating on her (I'm not - nor would I). She is thinking I am going to lunch with people (again, I'm not). She is leary of our neighbors thinking they are sneaking into our house (they aren't). I'm at a loss as to what to do. She is on medication, and she needs to call her psychiatrist, but she won't. I honestly think she needs her meds adjusted, but I'm afraid she will get worse.

The last time all this happened she had a nervous breakdown and ended up in the hospital. The difference now is that she has a job, whereas before she didn't so she had plenty of time to think and dwell. I am nervous she will lose her job if her mental break gets too severe. I'm scared for my own mental health in trying to help her. I'm thinking of reaching out to her psychiatrist myself but not sure what she will do if anything.

Bottom line, I am worried this will turn into something worse. I know what to look for this time around though so that is good. I am worried I will lose my job if I have to leave work. 

Have any of you dealt with this? If so, how did you get through it? I feel alone and that I have no one to discuss this issue with other than Reddit.",30Sep2019,2
188,"I'm having a lot of trouble lately. I just lost my only parent, had a recent break up, and it seems everything is falling apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, I wouldn't try to be affectionate with my Mother or any other family member. I would try to hide all emotion from them and sometimes had giant fits. However, I would always get attached to a certain female - Whether it be a teacher, camp coordinator, basically anything that wasn't family. Those people, I had an easy time showing emotion and being affectionate with them.  


Now as an adult, I feel a little similar. I no longer have fits of course, but I still don't feel so close to my family. I still do not want to show emotion or be affectionate with them. As my mother approached death however, I couldn't really hide my emotions there. It hurt so much to see her the way she was. Now I have always been attached to only 1 person, usually my partner, or a close friend. They're ""my person"" and I basically need to communicate with them often, be affectionate and emotional with them. I don't really care about anyone else. I mean I do care, but they can't make me go from sad to happy if something happens - Only ""my person"" could do that. Most of the time, if they're happy then I'm happy. If they're mad I'm anxious and scared and sad. I love my friends but unless one of them is ""my person"", no one can make truly make me happy. I've also tried time and time again to be happy with myself, and I mean sometimes it works, but I'm so lonely inside.

I'm on 2 kinds antidepressants for depression, and was diagnosed with ""borderline"" BPD. As in, I don't completely fit someone who is 100% BPD, as I don't have fits of anger and I'm not vindictive. But obviously this is something more than just BPD. I went to therapy and it didn't work as much as I wanted it to. I just want to be like a ""normal average"" person. :(",30Sep2019,2

191,"I've (21F) been seeing my current psychiatrist for about 6 months. I'm still on one medication (60mg Prozac) prescribed by my previous psychiatrist (dosage has been raised and lowered numerous times) and another one (100mg Lamactle) that my new psychiatrist had prescribed me when I first met with her. I was feeling ok for a while but everything seems to be spiraling downhill these days.

Lately I have been getting an overwhelming, intense anxiety at random times. Nothing I can think of necessarily triggers it other than when I'm scolded for messing up at work (which has been something I've dealt with since i was a little kid, that got better for a brief period once I started the medication my previous psychiatrist prescribed me but has been becoming more and more frequent lately) but I get this anxiety at other time during the day as well with no clear trigger. I can't focus on anything, I'm very shaky and have been over eating a lot. 

Now I don't experience depression or suicidal thoughts unless i'm anxious and since I'm anxious everyday lately I've been feeling very suicidal. I don't know how to go about conveying this to my doctor tomorrow during my appointment because the appointments unfortunately are rushed (scheduled in 15 min increments to accommodate every patient needing assistance). I often forget most points i want to make when asked how i'm doing because my brain is usually all over the place during my appointments.

192,"I constantly feel anxious, but the worst part is the paranoia. I feel like everyone is out to get me, im always in this hyper-aware vigilante state where I have to look at everyone while im walking down the hallway, or I always have to turn my head when I think someones coming even when its just a leaf. For example, when I listen to music alone in my room with headphones, im constantly opening my eyes and looking at my door because I feel like someone is in my room. My brain always turns normal parts of a song into someone calling my name, or knocking on my door. This bothers me so much. I hate not being able to relax and enjoy myself. I currently have no diagnosis but I am seeing a therapist. Ive told her about my anxiety, but I haven’t told her about the paranoia because i didnt even realise that what it was. I was so used to it, it became just part of my day to have to look at everyone that passes me in the hallway, or constantly looking up at the harmless couple that sits near me at lunch incase they are going to mess with me. I feel lile everyone is out to get me and that im going to become the victim of something somehow. Another example is when im in the car on the way to school, i feel like someone is going to come and rob our car while we are waiting at a stop light. When I ride the bus home, i feel like someone is going to try and steal my phone. I do my best to avoid such situations as best i can, so when i walk to class, ill exit the building and walk the long way around. Or when i take the bus, ill sit in the back to avoid the whole thought process of being nervous and paranoid. When people im not close with talk to me, i feel like they are trying to get information from me, or theyre plotting againts me somehow.

193,"New to this sub, hoping to gain some insight... I feel like I’m in an endless cycle and I don’t know how to break it.

I’ve had struggles with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation since at least high school that I can remember. I always just chalked it up to hormones, and the fact that being a teenager sucks and that life gets better so I kept it under wraps for the most part…until about 3 years ago. My sister committed suicide at 15, about a week after we had gotten into a fight and she stopped speaking to me, even if I tried. The fallout was absolutely devastating. It shook me to my core. 

Since her passing, I feel like I’ve gotten progressively worse as time has gone on and I’ve gotten older. I try not to blame myself, but I can never get the thought out of my head that “Maybe if I had done it first, she would still be here”. A lot of the time I just feel empty, like a puppet going through the motions. I usually have suicidal thoughts every day (especially at night), followed by guilt and the image of my sister the day she passed, and finally shame that I would even consider it after what my family and I went through. It is emotionally exhausting.

I’m also prone to erratic and inconsistent behavior. Over the last 3 years I’ve had periods of ghosting every single one of my friends and secluding myself inside, heavy drug and alcohol use, going out constantly and being around friends every day, complete sobriety, spending impulsively and excessively, intense anger, going days to weeks without talking to half of my family, depression and cabin fever, anxiety, and paranoia.

I’ve been to both counseling and a psychiatrist over this time. I stopped going to both after a month, stopped taking the medication after a month, and never went to get an EKG that the psych recommended when she said there was a possibility I may be bipolar.

On the other hand, I’ve also done well for myself. I work a full time job while going to school, and have so far graduated with a 2 year degree with honors.

I just don’t know what to do. Some days I feel like I need help, and other days I feel like I can conquer the world. I also think sometimes that even if I were to go that I would just think I’m fine down the road and stop going. Recently I had a drunken night where I was going to attempt in front of my friends and my dad if he didn’t get the box cutter away from me. Since then I’ve been back and forth. I just don’t know what to do anymore and how to combat this.

We have been long-distance **friends for about 9 years** now, and I noticed his **personality changing**.  
He seems **unmotivated, careless, drained of creativity**, and **less joyful** than he was before.  
I constantly have to initiate things and bring up ideas, or **he could just do nothing all day**.

Even though we are close friends, **it would seem weird and almost sarcastic to have a serious conversation** about mental problems, because of the nature of our friendship (mostly gaming and just joking around). I have my **own problems with pushing people away**, because of the pressure and fear of expectations and not wanting to lose my personal freedom, but he is the **only person who never felt like a burden** to me. This might be because he never has any expectations, doesn't pressure me by initiating, and doesn't look for me if I isolate myself for days, all **because his drugs keep him satisfied**. This is why **I feel like I'm a bad friend** and that I'm **exploiting him** for my own selfishness. His constantly mellow personality matches with my fearful mind and I get to have the **control that I lack with my own thoughts**.

If I choose to keep it this way for my own sake, first of all **I should be disgusted by myself**, and I might **lose him to his drugs** making him an emotionless husk, but I have **no idea how to help him** without actual confrontation about this problem, which is the last thing I would want to do.

201,"Hello and thank you for your time!

I have been considering assisted dying for quite a long time but the process is long and uncertain and I would appreciate some information about the whole ordeal. I am fully aware that it might take another 5-8 years but I am fine with that, if it gives me a shot at finding any form of peace. At that time I will be in my mid thirties and will have lived for over two decades with depression, self harm and suicide attempts.

My life isnt hell on a daily basis and I have a lot of amazing people in my life. In all other aspects I am healthy and strong but my head is killing me. I am as educated as I am smart and I would be on paper aswell but I get real sad sometimes and just fall into the darkness. My illness has made achieving everything and especially keeping all of it very hard. Your boss needs to be a saint to accept an employee leaving for weeks to rot in a ward.

 I am suicidal on a clinical scale for over half my life and the sadest part is that its just beeing me at this point. My family and close friends have come to accept it aswell but shareing just who I am and what I think has landed me in a close ward (escorted by the police) just because I was honest to someone who I considered a friend at that time.

I dont want to be crippled by some half-assed suicide attempt and much more I dont want to leave like a thief in the night, sneaking away into the silence like I did something wrong. A friend of mine had her mother kill herselfe when she was a child and she never got the answers and it just left a big hole in her heart ( I dont have children because of my condition and outcomes like that). I dont want to tear my loved ones appart, in the contrary! I want to answer all their questions and help them deal with my decission and take full responsebility for it. I think 5-8 years together with over a decade of beeing sick, years of therapy and swallowing pills should count as a well formed decission. I am well aware that I would have to go through psyche evaluation by a lot of doctors and maybe have to accept that I dont get the result that I want out of it but its the responsible way in my honest opinion. Thank you for any input and I dont care where in europe I have to go.

203," hello there, I feel really helpless right now. I'm a 20 year old female and I struggle with an internal conflict every morning. I ""argue"" with myself everyday. I go back and forth with myself everyday about various things that I struggle with. Let me give you a few examples. I tried to kill myself back in August yet when I say that out loud, my brain goes ""no that's not true."" I know I wouldn't lie about something as serious as a suicide attempt.

""Maybe you should actually try this time to make up for you lying about it."" This is a recurring thought I have every morning.


 I don't hear voices or anything but my brain is constantly invalidating me. Funny thing is that my brain didn't start saying it was a lie until two days ago. Up until now, it hasn't been a problem. Another example is when I was sexually assaulted back in January and now whenever I think about it, my brain makes me think it was my fault or that it wasn't a big deal. Whenever I try to remember specific details or try to piece together things about the suicide attempt, it takes ALOT of effort and my head starts to hurt. I'm stuck in my own head everyday and I have to sit here and listen to it. For hours and hours everyday. The last two days when I wake up in the morning, my thoughts kind of ""yell"" or become very ""loud"" and jump out at me.

I've been physically pushing people away. Telling them to fuck off and ""dont fucking touch me"".

Fits of anger. And I keep forgetting about the people I've forgotten about. They dont know how I'm feeling because I havent said anything, yet I'm crying my eyes out in front of them and they're clueless.

I have a history of hyper-religious delusions and violence. Thankfully I've never seriously hurt anyone and it is well controlled with medication, therapy and honest reporting.

I'm trying to be positive but I just think... I don't know.

I hate the shift that I can't describe. It's kind of like ""when the mood in the room changes"" and the room is my own head.

I'm sleep deprived and having difficulty staying asleep.

The last one indicates an issue.

If my heart starts pounding then I have to find some method of intervention. Medication first then hospitalization. 

*Sigh*

And that's ok. I haven't been in the hospital for over four years or jail for over two. Haven't spoken to the police in over two.

I'm struggling today not to feel misunderstood. 

I'm grateful to have the support and understanding of my wife and my family.

I'm grateful for medical professionals.

I'm grateful that I've learned that kindness is essential to a healthy mind.

I'm learning and practicing kindness to others and even to myself. 

I'm going to treat myself kindly.


I've never seen a Reddit post about this stuff.

It would be nice if someone saw this and understood.

Cheers everyone",30Sep2019,1
209,"Hello all, I’m really new to this so I’m not quite sure how to share but I feel like I should. I’ve suffered from really bad anxiety for the last couple years now and I’m finally deciding to get help. From severe anxiety to depression and body dysmorphia, I always started treatment then never went through. I’ve decided to put all of that behind me and go fully through with it now. I prefer not to talk to my friends about it, but they have noticed it a lot lately and have been saying stuff about how they notice it. I just wanted to share here cause I feel more comfortable I suppose.",30Sep2019,1
210,"Sometimes I forget how absolutely crazy my youth was. My mother and grandma decided that I didn’t need to have a relationship with my father so the ran of to very rural America. There they become abusive and neglectful alcoholics who also happened to hoard and not the cute organized chaos way. Like trash up to the ceiling type with many cats and dogs running a mock. I forget about how my childhood friends never came over and the one time I had one over he was afraid to talk to me after that. Mom and grandma didn’t have many friends and seemed to alienate everyone that came near. I was removed from the house a couple times. The second time was when the county tried to find my father. He’s no saint but he never deserved to have a restraining order against him for wanting to be in his child’s life. I found out about this much later in adult life. My maternal influences destroyed my relationship with a male connection. I’m still shocked that I try and seek it out. I’ve spent most of my life in a relationship with hating my father when I should have just been more forgiving of the way his story played out and how in turn affected mine. I’ve been blaming the patriarchy for a bunch of things I could have avoided by just being a little more accepting and compassionate of people as they are. All I can change is myself and even that seems semi impossible. I’m very grateful for my fairly simple job. I’m grateful I’m not in an abusive marriage anymore(yes I’ve had a lot of bullshit) I’m happy I’m in complete control of my physical surroundings, I’m grateful for maybe working on my relationship with my father and repairing my finances and my opinion of the straight male.  I’m grateful for my normal life. 💙😉",30Sep2019,1
211,"I took the first steps today to treating my mental health. After years of dealing with it, I made the decision. I went to the local mental health center. They take walk in assessments during the mornings, and (unofficially) gave me a diagnosis of bipolar 2. Unfortunately they have no actually appointments until November, but it's still a step.

I've been fighting myself for 15 years, and I might finally have some relief.",30Sep2019,3
212,"I am 19 yrs old. I had a psychological assessment done recently because things haven't felt right and I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression and had a very very weird sleep schedule..like going for 34 hours at a time with no sleep and carrying on the next few days normally and then sometimes oversleep almost a full 24 hours other times usually because I'm too depressed to get out of bed. I hate dealing with people (I only have one friend and that’s all I need) because of the anxiety and because I have trouble focusing during conversations and forming complete thoughts and feel as though my thoughts get blocked or jumbled in social interactions. I started hearing voices the day I had the psychological assessment. It sounded like a chatter of voices in a cafeteria and i could only make out a few words they would say. A couple weeks passed and I got the results for the assessment. Apparently my memory skills are almost borderline impaired and they believe I have an unspecified personality disorder. They couldn’t narrow it down to one because apparently I showed a lot of traits for six different personality disorders (borderline, schizotypal, dependent, avoidant, bipolar and antisocial). Now I only hear faint whispers occasionally or something calling my name at times (usually before bed) and I'll wake up at night and feel a presence in the room with me. The world doesn't feel like it's real at times and I'll feel like I'm seeing moving objects/faint outlines of figures in my peripherals. I'll think I see it in my peripherals and then I'll go look but its gone and I can only see the impression of where it was in the air. The air itself seems to move weird at times and I feel as though I can see it but then again I have poor vision. I'll freak myself out thinking I'm seeing things and feeling presences getting close to me but there's nothing there and I'm just getting myself worked up over nothing. But it feels real and the other half of me believes it's spirits and tries to establish contact with them because I feel like they're trying to talk to me but haven't pierced the veil?  I know it sounds crazy but I also have weird beliefs and am not gonna lie I’ve messed around with some witchy stuff. I feel at times I'm high when I'm sober or I'm tripping or it all just feels like a dream and things become way more intense and there are so many messages in the environment around me. I don't know if I'm just overthinking absolutely everything and maybe I'm just tricking myself into seeing everything I see but it's gotten to the point I have to light sage to calm myself down and break down in tears for it all to stop. Other times I go out of my way to try to make contact with them and figure out what they want or who they are and keep asking them to give me signs or when I hear the faint whispers, for them to speak clearly and loud so I can understand. Then again I feel like I could just be making myself think I'm hearing things because I'm paranoid and overanalyze any sound or thing I hear/see to the point I contort it into something I didn't actually hear/see. I just in total have a lot of hard swings of depression, anxiety and paranoia and just want to know what this means exactly and if I'm going bonkers. A lot of mental illness runs in my family, my father has bipolar and is a clinically diagnosed sociopath, basically everyone on my dads side has some sort of mental illness and an aunt with schizophrenia. My worst fear is to become like that and I feel like it’s beginning to happen or I’m allowing that fear to consume myself and only feeding the delusion with my thoughts.",30Sep2019,5

214,"Strap in. 

My brother has been struggling with mental health for about a year now. He is in his early 20s, not in school and unemployed. He has been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder as well as anxiety and struggles with his temper.

He usually stays in his room all day, rejecting my offers to go Longboarding, shoot hoops in the driveway, play video games or do anything other than watching streamers on twitch. He sees a therapist once a month due to my mom wishes. He refuses to go anymore than that because he doesn’t want to talk to anyone. 

The only time I can spend time with him and get any sort of glimpse of what’s on his mind is when he smokes cigarettes outside, I smoke with him but I don’t even smoke. I do it just to see how he’s doing. Don’t worry, I don’t inhale.

I have gotten him 2 jobs, both of which he has quit within 3 days of starting them.

My father is a hard man. Very blue collar. He is beyond fed up with it at this point. He was incredibly lenient and understanding in the beginning. But because my brother refuses help and actively avoids everything and everyone, My father wants to kick him out essentially making my brother homeless. 

I told him if he kicks my brother out, I will move across the country and cut contact with him. My mom and I are enough to keep my father at bay but it’s becoming unbearable. 

I’m out of ideas. At this point I’m hoping he just wakes up with a newfound drive and self confidence and makes a complete 180. 

I have never struggled with mental health. I don’t know what he is going through but it physically hurts me to see him to sad all the time. I don’t have any advice for him.

215,"I fucking hate anxiety and ADHD and I fucking hate that I passed them down to my kids. 

I'm completely flipping out over something that seems so stupid. The baby took MY crayons that I keep up just for when I am coloring with the kids. They have their own crayons that they can pretty much use whenever (washable). I was in the shower and my husband was in the room where I store the crayons. I got out and the 2 year old had the 64 crayons dumped all over the playroom floor and had peeled most of them and broken them into pieces. 8 year old and 5 year old just not doing anything about it. 

Can I have 10 minutes without a huge fucking disaster? Do normal parents have to sit on top of their children and observe and entertain them at every waking moment? 

If I ask them to clean up like normal humans they just stare at me, same thing if I try to help them. So I'm flying off into a huge fucking lunatic rage over what seems to be crayons but what is really an entire systematic disregard for anything that pleases me. 

And now I'm even more ragey because I don't want my kids to hate me for being ragey and I just need everyone to just leave me all the way the fuck alone and just do one GODDAMN thing right for once!",30Sep2019,2

217,"TRIGGER WARNINGS FOR BINGING AND SELF HARM

&amp;#x200B;

Diagnoses: Cyclothemia, OCD, PTSD, GAD

This weekend I helped my dad move a bunch of stuff out of his storage unit so he can move into his new house. He gave me some pretty nice stuff, and took my wife and I out for dinner at a nice restaurant, so all in all it was a nice day until bedtime. I only got a few hours of sleep, and had to help my dad again the next day. While helping him I had an asthma attack, and my step-mom broke her finger, so that was fun. I put a popsicle stick on and wrapped it with some medical tape for her. Worked for now. I got home and was fine, and then went to pick my wife up from work. She went to bed after we had dinner because she had to be up early. While she was asleep I got really depressed and went to Walmart and got a bunch of candy. I binge ate all of it and it made me sick to my stomach. I felt really really depressed after that, but kind of dealt with it until my wife woke up. After I woke her up for work, I told her what I did, and how I felt, and she said it would be okay, and I just have to keep trying. She went to work, and I went to sleep. This morning after I woke up, I still felt like shit, but handled it. My psychiatrist called to tell me she was prescribing Trazadone to help me sleep, since I have insomnia. I was going to get the prescription after my wife got back from work with the car. We went, but the pharmacy was closed for lunch. She went to hold my hand on the way in, but I pushed it away, so she got angry and went to the car while I went to the Pharmacy and found out they were closed. We came back home and she went to take a shower. While she was showering I was having extreme suicidal ideation and began googling the different side effects of overdosing on pills. It all got a little bit too much, and I decided that I was going to self harm. I went to my toolbox, opened the drawer and took my box cutter. I then went over to the sink and cut myself up and down 5 times. I walked into the bathroom while my wife was showering to use some hydrogen peroxide. Before I used it, I walked up to her and said ""Now I see why people cut themselves."" She immediately jumped out of the shower and started freaking out and yelling at me, but I was in such a manic state that I was fine. She dried herself off and we went into the kitchen and both cried onto each other. At this point I was already supposed to have left for work, but I'm just crying on the kitchen floor. She called my supervisor for me and told her I wasn't going to be in today. After we were done crying and talking about it, we went to Walmart to get my prescription, and some bandages, gauze, and medical tape. We got home, and I went to take a shower. She helped me put Neosporin on it and bandage it. After that I went back into a manic episode. So here we are, sitting in our apartment and eating 6 toaster strudels each because we're depressed.

218,"Hi,

I have been depressed for about 5 years now, but I've had significant rise in my mental health in past 6 months. Thing is just that I don't have good relationships with my parents and my ex and I broke up during summer, which is fine. 

I used to have huge breakdowns and suicidal thoughts, but now I just feel regularly sad,powerless and lonely. This feeling of loneliness is really hurting badly, it's almost unbearable. I really can't be a full day alone or I start to feel extremely lonely. It hurts so much. Is there anything I could do, or should I maybe start looking up conpant from dating apps? 

I can't stand this and I need help desperately.

219,"I am really struggeling with this problem:
Since I was a Teenager I always look younger than my actual age. Like when I was 14 I looked like 10, when I was 18 I looked like 15 and now I am 23 and look like 18.
The real problem occurs in society. When I meet a group of unknown people, they stare at me and the first question is mostly ""what's your age"" followed by ""I expected you to be much younger"". 
I always feel uncomfortable in these situations, like I would not fit into this group of people. Because of this feeling, my self-esteem and my self-confidence are very low, which results in a shy behavior. It's hard for me to approach someone, especially of the opposite sex, because I'm scared of being rejected by them due to my young appearance. 
I'm going to the gym and keeping an eye on my outer appearance. Although it helps a lot, it results in another problem: If I don't go to the gym as planned or especially leaving the house without checking my appearance, I feel terribly insecure.
I haven't told this anyone before and I would be glad about every help/advise I could get.",30Sep2019,2
220,"Well I remember the start of spring break I began dealing with very debilitating headaches. They were so mentally effective that even though previously I had been very happy, life already seemed hopeless then. After school started back, things improved, slightly. In the end of May I got just slightly injured in PE at school in the head against my will. And while the doctors have done testings and scans proving there was nothing serious during the event, the irrational overwhelming headache came back. Everyday, all day, just as it had in April. I tried to wait it out, didn't work. I tried pain medication, didn't work. I then went to NYC, and after the airplane ride I had tinnitus. I tried anti depressants after they were prescribed in July. Only seemed to make it worse.  I began having ear pains, and I went to get that examined. I later had to get surgery after it was observable that I was having visible ear issues. Had the surgery. Still have the tinnitus. August and September I began having tremor sensations and tachycardia. Been to many doctors for all symptoms since it became more urgent since the new school year started. Nothing. I can't cope with it. I almost can't describe how effecting the headache is. Makes it harder to think, speak, everything. It makes me feel depressed and stressed. I'm going to a neurologist soon, and if that doesn't work I'm going to go back to crying every night. Being dead would be better than this.",30Sep2019,1
