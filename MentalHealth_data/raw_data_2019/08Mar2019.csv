And then I get mad at the fact that I‚Äôm getting mad about such stupid things. It just snowballs until I‚Äôm sitting there shaking feeling like I need to fucking destroy something. I wish I could just duck everything in this room up. I want to put my fist through my tv. I want to smash my controller off the wall. I want to break all of the windows.

I feel pathetic. It‚Äôs not just video games but I don‚Äôt do much else these days so that‚Äôs usually the only thing that‚Äôs even slightly stressful in my life right now. But like, I feel absolutely pathetic for getting so mad about something like that. I play games to enjoy myself and to escape real life for a little while, and yet whenever someone else kills me in a game I actually find myself wishing that they‚Äôd kill themselves.

Mental health charity, CALM and East Anglian duo Amethysts approach toxic masculinity and male depression in their video for ‚ÄòHow It Is‚Äô. 

Simon Gunning, CEO of the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM): ‚ÄúSuicide remains the single biggest killer of men under 45 in the UK, so it‚Äôs crucial we talk about this issue and the themes that surround it. Music can be an extremely powerful medium for this, so it‚Äôs great to see Amethysts opening up this conversation among their fans and beyond.‚Äù

Recently I've been experiencing what I first that were moments of disassociation but they became even... weirder? It's like out of no where I'll get this heavy headed feeling and if I talk I don't understand what I'm even saying. It's like a foreign language coming out of my mouth. I don't totally understand what's being said to me but I can get the gist of it. I'm a bit dyslexic but nowadays it's even worse. It takes me a long time to read things and understand what I'm seeing. 

The first time it happened I was driving my car and singing along to a song I know by heart when out of nowhere it was super foggy outside and I didn't recognize my own voice or what song I was singing. I was sure I wasn't singing the right words. I actually posted about that moment before but now I'm wondering if it's something more health related because it's been happening more often.

I didn't lie to hurt anyone I just did it so I could leave the house and go out once in a while.  That also more or less stopped working and I snuck out a few times and they caught me. They eventually found out I smoked pot and things got extremely out of hand. They told me to stop but I got sneaky and did it behind their back. They threatened me with military school and eventually sent me to boarding school in a tiny town with less than 200 residents. So my mom is basically telling me that I have ODD, Compulsive lying disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and all because I wanted to smoke some pot and have some fun. She said I have a mental disorder because I want to smoke pot but I told her I would stop doing anything she disproved of until I moved out. She later told me that that was the issue and I shouldn't want to smoke pot and party when i am 18.

I have never let it get in the way of my priorities and stopped when I had things like finals or AP testing.

27,"First I'm in stlouis USA. Second I'm on my phone and probably super rambling. Third here's my  throwaway. I'm sorry. 

So, I've been off and on meds my entire life. I just got back on health insurance. I've done this before. All of last year I was on top of my life. Wasnt on meds. Got a new job, dream job. Making money. Social. Responsible. On it. Since xmas I've been spiraling. Just had to borrow money from a friend cuz I couldnt pay my phone bill. My rent is late (they're being really nice about it) I'm a mess. My house is disgusting i can barely take care of my pets let alone myself. So... i need help. I've been on meds before but as an adult I've never paired it with a therapist. Last time I tried to get on meds and talk to someone it was a BATTLE one of the most difficult things I ever had to do. I finally got into a Primary Care Physician. Who told me that there is a shortage of psychiatrists and psychologists and therapist but ""what were you on previously? What do you need now it's probably going to be six months at least before you get in to see anyone"" 

So I got on meds. And gave up on the therapist. That was three years ago. I lost my health insurance painfully weaned myself off meds had a great successful year and now I'm in a rut, I cant shake it. I'm getting those fucking suicidal ideation fucking cutting thoughts. I'm not going to do it. Not even close. Just sometimes my brain pops it out as an escape. Even though 2 seconds later my brain is like.. fuck that that's dumb you're too old for that shit and you have your dream job dont fuck it up. You actually have a pretty great life and an awesome future to look forward to. 


Soo.... my question to you guys is... do any of you know any affordable therapists or a way to find one that could get me in sooner rather than later. I'm already working on getting back on meds... but it's the same situation as before through a Primary physician. And I cant just do meds again. I need to talk this shit out. I need help. I need someone to hold my hand because I'm kinda scared and I dont want to fuck my life up.",08Mar2019,2
28,"Sooooo my family has a long history of mental health issues , so I knew as I got older I would probably end up experiencing depression or anxiety or maybe some anger problems . I never had a true understanding of mental health though. It was frowned upon in my school, programs were cancelled that helped support kids with mental health. My family didn't want to talk about , they were embarrassed. So now here I am 25 years later trying to deal with things I don't understand. I have gone to a doctor but they have just been testing me on different medications and not really fixing the issue I guess ? Sometimes they seem more interested in me being a guinea pig. I have always tried to handle things on my own before depending on medication as well.  I have also looked around for  a therapist but they are quite expensive ...anyways... I was wondering does anyone else experience random fits of anger even when you are totally fine ?  Or you start stressing out even when your happy?  Maybe get angry over the tiniest things even when you don't want to.. and then there are times when I randomly remember an embarrassing moment and somehow focus on it for the rest of the day and freak out for hours. I've only been put on medication for anxiety but I really think there is more going on.  Does anyone else experience similar issues ? If so any ideas on how to handle the situation ? Maybe some type of excercise or hobby to help ?Of course I'll still be going to a doctor and attempting to find a therapist but  like I said before I like to try handling thing on my own before medication. So just any kind of opinion , advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated because it's only gotten worse from when I was a teenager and it's just a huge feeling of being pushed over the edge and I can't always handle that...

# hard truths -- mental health, stigma and the transitionary nature of life

[""have you ever stopped to consider how many people didn't screw up for you to be sitting here tonight?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CikveyZjum4)

mental health is a topic that is much more comfortable to avoid. it is a hard truth. as down as one may feel, i fully believe that the nature of the universe is an on/off system. everything is constantly in transition. even us. especially us. but yet, this is a topic we don't want to address, and i get that to an extent. where i come from, we don't talk about this. we are emotionally repressed. traditionally it has been more one-sided, with 8 out of 10 suicides in Ireland being men. recently however women have caught up in this tragic race to the end. Ireland now ranks among the highest rates of female suicide in the EU.

so in honour of Womens' Day, i would like to express this: the tide is turning. somehow, we are becoming more repressed and unable to deal with the struggles of life. i love the bones of every single one of you. i am blessed to have you in my life. not everyone has this -- as Terence says, there is only one true problem -- ""we are inappropriate to ourselves. we are ill with ego. we have a narcissism that we can't put down. the thing that makes you happy eventually makes you unhappy. nothing lasts."" to all my brothers and sisters out there, please realise the transitional nature of life. our state can change very quickly, but never, ever lose faith. practice gratitude and appreciate what you do have, for we are truly lucky to be in the situation we're in‚Ä¶ looking at the bigger picture.

please don't be ashamed or afraid to speak. there is no shame in feeling down and out. isolation can never be the answer. there's already been too many promising young lives ended prematurely, for reasons that many of us will never be able to comprehend. please, know that you are appreciated, and know that you are loved, and the one thing we all have in common is that we suffer. suffering is relative so don't compare yours to others -- as Roosevelt said, ""comparison is the thief of joy"", and this is a two way street. do what you need to do but please, don't give up. you are valued and you are loved. stay strong. x",08Mar2019,1

In the 9 years of therapy I've been involved in, I've been diagnosed with ADHD, severe depression,anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, a rage disorder, and one that I cant remember the name of but it was something along the lines of being a disruptive child.  Some of the diagnosis' have replaced others, as symptoms evolved. Like the replacement of my bipolar diagnosis with that of borderline personality disorder. My issue is that I still dont feel like I identify with any of these and I fear I've been misdiagnosed.

I have liked her (i still do) so much and had a great admiration, compassion and love for her. I told her about my feelings and she said that she likes me as a friend and I told her that it was alright and that I respected her feelings and we can still be good friends as we were both not ready for any kind of relationship and I cared about her a lot. I had never sexually fantasized about her. Because I felt like it was wrong and would be demeaning to her. But sometimes I also thought that maybe there's nothing wrong with it and it was just a self created moral stigma. And I thought that maybe something was wrong with me cuz there's nothing wrong to feel sexually attracted to someone but in fact it was healthy to do that so that it will make a stronger bond. So one day I forced myself to masturbate to her. I opened her picture on my phone then her voice notes and tried to masturbate. I stopped after about a minute. I did not have an orgasm. But now I feel guilty about it all the time that I did this and I have this feeling that I disrespected her. I feel really ashamed about it. What would she think if she knew it.

I've tried mentioning my issues to my mother but she just brushes it off as nothing because ""(she) had anxiety and OCD as a child"" and ""Its probably just your age"" but it's not. It's been three years and it's only gotten worse.

I've always made myself a shoulder to lean on, a lot of my friends go to me for support. They trust me and I have no idea why. I never talk about my issues to friends and family because I'm too afraid. I can't trust people enough, I have three close friends, I have deep feelings of... something, for one of them. Another is wonderful and I can about her but I always feel like she is pushing me away. The last is a wonderful, bright person whom I cannot bring myself to ruin with my feelings.

My school offers a ""Wellness Center"" but ironically, I'm too anxious to go there.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start the very \*Fun\* list of symptoms in hope that someone can give me any Idea what's going on, or at least I get to vent.

I can't handle new people, if I don't know anyone in a room I shut down and refuse to talk. I can't, I don't like to call them panic attacks because the few people I've vented to have told me they aren't. I can't move, or breathe, or speak, I don't even cry. I just shut down from top to bottom with my head spinning, unable to ask for help.

I switch constantly from overeating and eating nothing at all. Eating is a defense mechanism, it makes me feel safe for a few minutes. My body image is destroyed, all I see in the mirror is a broken, fat piece of trash.

There are these stories in my heads, my characters that once started as simple manifestations of loneliness are now they're own entities. I love them, more than any other human being, they are my family, they are who I want to be. With them I'm never alone. Sometimes I just lie down and live out the stories, or act them out when left alone. I would much rather stay with them (I don't know how to describe it, talk to them) than go to school or study or read. They are a part of me. I could never leave them, but I know they are a part of my illness. (Some mild past research has told me this is called ""Maladaptive daydreaming"", and that it should be treated and relates to larger issues, but I really don't want them gone)

I always have this feeling of dread, or weight, or unease, I really don't know how to describe it.

I feel exhausted all the time. 

I feel like dying, I've experimented with huffing and taking large doses of Benadryl or cough syrup and the like. I know it kills brain cells, I don't mind, it dulls everything if even for a few seconds. I want to cut myself, but it's too harsh, I can't suffer. It's self harm I guess, I know its bad but it feels better - probably because it's bad. I don't know.

Music. Oh. My. Goddess. The music. If its not there I can't stand myself, this is a problem with classes that don't allow me to listen during lessons. I. Need. Too. Have. It. I would rather kill myself than listen to my music. If the music is there, my characters are more vibrant, happier, present. I'm a musician and my music is the most important thing in the world to me. 

I always feel nauseous. Always. And dehydrated, no matter how much water I force myself into choking down.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's it. That's all I can think of. If anyone can help me that would be great. Resources or anything that could possibly help me, letting me know what is wrong, I am forever grateful. ",08Mar2019,2
45,"Hey Reddit. I'll go ahead and start from the beginning. For those of you that stick through this, thank you.

About 6 years ago, I was in a car accident. I nearly died. The driver was going 80 mph and lost control. The car was an old model Toyota and did not have hip belts. It rolled 8 times, I was partially ejected. The car crushed me. I suffered facial trauma, a shattered sacrum, L4, and had several breaks in both illiac crests. I lacerated my liver, punctured my right lung, and broke 2 ribs. I also bruised up my kidneys. I was awake for the entire events. I never lost conciousness. 

Before we started rolling, there was a moment where things just kind of slowed down. I was panicked and in that slow moment, that fear disappeared. I was ready to go. I had accepted my impending doom. When I was admitted into the ICU, a few days later, I had to pretend like I was grateful to be alive.

I didn't have my family to support me as our relationship was strained. The whole event was very traumatic. I cried to ICU nurses about how I didn't want to exist, I cried the first time I got to wash my hair because it came out in handfuls due to the glass. I've always been a loner. I didn't have a ton of friends and alas had no one around during this time. I felt completely alone.

This didn't get better. I was in a wheelchair for 6 months. Both of my parents worked and I spent almost all of my time alone, besides the family arguments and drama. This seems to have messed me up the most.

I began to talk about the accident non stop. It was the first thing that I'd think about in the morning and the last thing I'd think about at night. I started to feel immense anger towards it. I felt isolated, and alone.

I refused physical therapy and taught myself how to walk again (this caused MASSIVE problems later on). I was scared. I thought that if I let my hip heal, there would be no one to remember what happened to me, if that makes sense. This went on for years. I lost everything and everyone. I struggled to make friends after that. A whole lot of just bad shit. In recent years, Id bounced around couselors trying to figure out why I couldn't move on, what was keeping me in this dark place. I couldn't stop thinking about how, if I'd just died that night, it would've been better. My life got progressively worse after the accident. Nothing seemed to help, no medication, talking about it did nothing. Now I was just fucked in the head and addicted to Ssri's. I went to a psychiatrist about a year and a half ago. I was promptly diagnosed with PTSD. 

I struggle with it every few months. I've noticed that it usually hits in times where I feel unsafe or vulnerable.

The first time it hit me BAD, I couldn't drive over bridges for MONTHS. I know, ridiculous right? I won't go into the grimy details. But, I had had a wonderful night, no stressors, nothing. It was around 3 a.m. and I was driving home. I began to drive over a popular dam in my town. Out of nowhere, I got the urge to drive off. Which is unusual, seeing as I'm terrified of heights and have never been like that. A real call of the void moment. I started to panic because it felt like I couldn't stop, or slow down, or speed up. It felt like I couldn't keep my hands on the wheel. I spent months terrified of that bridge for no reason. One day, it just went away. No more fear, nothing. I began to try to drive over it every day. 

The next time, I was living in a very sketchy area in a very sketchy town. Someone tried to kick my door in, and after that things just went down hill. I couldn't sleep for weeks. I couldn't eat. I couldn't function. I was TERRIFIED to be in that house alone. I eventually moved out because I couldn't move past it.

Most recently, I began a relationship. Things have been going great, but it's beginning to hit me again. I can't sleep, my anxiety is out of control. I just want to run. I want to run away from it all. I feel crazy and jealous and I can't control it. Im trying hard not to isolate myself. I'm over eating, I'm having trouble getting up in the morning and taking care of myself. I feel very defensive and like I have no where to go, no home. I'm having awful nightmares. I feel like I want to cry but I can't. I'm at a complete loss.

I've tried to talk through it, I've tried to take medication (which I'm on currently), I don't have a great support system at home. Both of my parents are Ill. Being at home causes a great burden for me as my family and I have a very complicated history. I feel that no one understands and I'm so angry that after all of these years I can't get over that one moment. I'm constantly going over it in my head when I'm like this, what the doctors did, what I did, why didn't I die, what happened if it was worse. I feel like I'm on edge 24/7. Kind of like I'm constantly in danger.  I can't seem to stop projecting my mental bullshit on others. It happens every time. I talk and talk and talk. People don't want to be around me, which is reasonable because I wouldn't want to be around me either.

I REALLY don't want to ruin this relationship. It's good for me, very good actually. I like who I am when I'm with this person. They're supportive and we work well together. It's the first serious relationship I've been in since the accident.

So, my question is, can anyone give me advice on how to fix this mess? How do I move on? How do I get rid of this anger? How do I pull myself out of this episode? Any advice would be welcomed. I'm tired of feeling crazy, I'm tired of being alone. I need help. ",08Mar2019,2

47,"I finished my undergrad with a 4.45/4.5 GPA and had not had any problems with mental health (since highschool) until moving for my Masters. During my undergrad I could do math for 12 hours on end to the point that I would frequently use continuous dot matrix printer paper to save time lost from flipping pages. Now, however, I can barely get up or do anything. I underwent a psychiatric assessment following ""treatment-resistant insomnia"" (silenor, zopiclone, and low-dose antipsychotics) and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder on top of my previously-diagnosed OCD, depression, and ADHD (as well as history of anorexia despite being a male).

48,"I'll start off with a little background of myself.
Growing up, my parents themselves never really had any close friends and never went to outings or even just out to eat once in awhile with other families that they went to church with. I noticed these things at a young age and I yearned for the complete opposite social life, so I ended up forcing myself to make some good friends up until high school graduation. 

I joined the military straight out of high school and made a few very close friends since we practically lived with each other, but of course the physical interactions don't last long since everybody went back home once we all got out of there. 

Fast forward to current state. I've been back home for two years and I still have no idea how to interact people when I go out, or even how to go about being actual friends. I consider myself to be such an open book and I'd love to be a great friend to somebody, I just don't know what to do since everybody sticks to their circles in this city and I missed that mark. 

I've been diagnosed with GAD, social anxiety, and severe depression by the VA but their services here aren't the best so I don't have anybody to talk to there. For example, ""Hmmm yes I'm sure that must be hard"" is the best of a conversation I've gotten out of there.

49,"I‚Äôm 19 male and in the past year or so I noticed my mood fluctuates quite frequently from smiling and laughing to virtually no emotion and depressed and its mostly dependent on if there‚Äôs something that triggers either or and sometimes its random. 

Anyway, the past week or so there‚Äôs a class I genuinely hate. Something about it makes me feel so exposed and uncomfortable and its where this overwhelming feeling of emotion started.

Basically in class last week I was sitting there and randomly I felt super sad and felt like I could cry. A wave of loneliness just hit me and I honestly thought about leaving the class to cry but after about 5-10 minutes it went away. I thought it was a one time thing but it happened again this week and today (one time in the class and another time when my friends were talking to each other). I just had no urge to say anything and I wanted to cry and disappear.

51,"I was clinically diagnosed and put on medication for depression and anxiety about a year ago. I was 25 at this point and while I knew I had depression for over a decade, I had never had thought to go to therapy or take meds.

About a week ago, I was diagnosed with adult ADHD and I've been switched to new medication.

Depression &amp; Anxiety: I was prescripted Escitalopram, 10 mg in September, 2018 and have been taking it since. The side effects included weight gain. A LOT of weight gain. Due to my history of eating disorders, losing weight is ridiculously difficult for me, so this upset me quite a bit. The medicine otherwise worked really well and I have possibly never been more stable than I am currently.

In the first few days of taking Escitalopram, I experienced extreme panic and anxiety attacks- side effects most people go through when taking new medication.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I have been switched to  Bupropion HCL for depression, anxiety, as well as ADHD.

I have also been given risperidone (0.5 mg at night).

I have no reservation with taking medication, however I would like to know the side effects beforehand so I know what to expect.

I just wonder if there is something more I could be doing or is it completely out of my control and my past traumas/abuse will forever have an impact on me in this way.

I guess I'm kind of wondering also if in a way it's my fault and I'm contributing to my depression. It used to come in phases throughout my life, now it has consistently stuck around for over a year now I just can't seem to get past it. 

To be honest I know I still struggle with feeling any emotions especially surrounding my past trauma and abuse and instead turn to various unhealthy coping mechanisms to avoid them.

Anyway, I essentially think about either getting shot, getting stabbed, or shooting myself in the head, taking a bunch of pills etc whenever I have no real desire to die. Like honestly despite certain current events I have a great life, so the fact that these thoughts are present, and actually help me sleep at night is frightening.

64,"Throwaway account because of reasons.

Buckle up, folks, because this is gonna be a long one. 

I feel like the answer to this question should be more obvious. You‚Äôre either a danger to yourself, or you‚Äôre not. But I don‚Äôt know anymore.

Some background: I (24/F) moved to a different state for college in 2013. I am now a couple of months away from completing a master‚Äôs degree in social work, and am hoping to get my LCSW and continue working in forensics (inpatient setting with folks who are Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity, Incompetent to Stand Trial, etc.).

When it comes to social supports, I‚Äôve always thought of myself as a ‚Äúquality over quantity‚Äù person, yet even with my closest friends, I‚Äôve always kind of felt like I was the second choice.  Currently, I live with my best friend, and have a boyfriend of 3 years who lives about an hour away. Other than those two, I have a handful of acquaintances, and a best friend back in my hometown. I have a good relationship with my family, but they are spread out across the country. So, essentially, I have a grand total of two members of my support system within a 1,000 mile radius.

I have struggled with chronic depression and occasional self-harm (the ole‚Äô pocket knife to the forearm) since I was around 14, and have been in therapy/on medication since I was diagnosed. In November of 2018, I slipped into one hell of a gnarly major depressive episode, and started cutting again for the first time in nearly a decade. I am feeling depressed (obviously), guilty, apathetic, anhedonic, lonely, isolated, and am starting to feel hopeless. Everyone keeps talking about how great it‚Äôll be when we finally graduate in May, and how everything will be okay once this is all over. I do not feel this way. I fear that I will not last long in this field with how unstable I‚Äôve been, and given that my depression is constant, I fail to see how things will ever really ‚Äúget better.‚Äù

Things kind of came to a head this evening when I called my boyfriend to tell him how I‚Äôve been feeling. I had a bit of a breakdown during class today, and I wanted to talk to him about it, hoping I‚Äôd feel better afterwards. 

Unfortunately, it only made things worse. Much worse.

I told him how I was feeling--lonely, isolated, and fearful that my instability would ultimately drive him and my best friend away. 

Now, I don‚Äôt know exactly what kind of response I was expecting, but the response that I got certainly wasn‚Äôt it. 

He essentially told me that I had taken a gamble moving to a different state in the first place, and that I shouldn‚Äôt have expected things to magically get better just by starting over. He said that it was my responsibility to go out and make friends, and that ‚Äúhaving flaws is not an excuse not to try to be better.‚Äù Regarding my fears of abandonment, he told me, ‚Äúthat mindset is really irritating,‚Äù and that I shouldn‚Äôt always assume no one will like me, and that I just have to be better about ‚Äúputting myself out there.‚Äù

I was floored. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. Here I am, feeling as close to genuinely wanting to die as I have ever been, and I‚Äôm being told that it‚Äôs my own fault, and I just need to be better. 

But, the thing is, he might be right. Maybe I do need to just ‚Äúbe better.‚Äù Whatever the case, while your girlfriend is crying to you on the phone about her passive suicidal ideations and her deepest, darkest insecurities is probably not the ideal time to be spouting such wisdom. 

I told him as much, and he replied that he was ‚Äújust trying to give me some comforting words,‚Äù but that he felt he was ‚Äúonly making things worse.‚Äù All I could muster was, ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù We were both silent for awhile, until I said something to the effect of, ‚ÄúI have never been so close to not wanting to be alive anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt either.‚Äù Tears were streaming down my face at this point, and I was at a loss for words. Images flashed in my mind of what would happen if I went home and pressed the knife a little harder, or cut ‚Äúup the stream‚Äù instead of ‚Äúacross the river.‚Äù I was driving home during this phone call, and thought about what it would be like to drive full speed into a wall. Not seriously considering it, but really, really letting the thought wash over me.  

He‚Äôd mentioned earlier that he had an early morning tomorrow and needed to get to sleep soon, so I told him I‚Äôd let him go. He said okay, but told me that I could call him before I went to sleep. I asked him if he still needed to sleep early, and he said, ‚Äúwell, yeah.‚Äù He said he loved me. I mumbled it back, and hung up. 

So, here‚Äôs where the hospitalization issue comes into play. 

In terms of self harm, I never go very deep, just enough to externalize the pain. Although I see my therapist weekly, and I tell him, my best friend, and my boyfriend when I‚Äôve cut, I have made it very clear to all involved parties that I will not make any sort of safety contracts saying that I won‚Äôt self harm, and nor will I promise to contact any of them before I do so. If I want to cut, I will cut, and I do not want to mislead any of them into thinking that they can stop me. I also do not want them to blame themselves in any way if I were to call them and do it anyways. 

Now, as a mental health worker, I would personally be very alarmed if a patient refused to promise that they would not hurt themselves. However, because I work in an inpatient setting, the circumstances and protocols are different, so I have a hard time extrapolating my response at work to my own situation.

Regarding suicide, I have a plan, but no means, and I‚Äôm not sure about intent. Thankfully, I would really have to go out of my way to acquire the means necessary for my plan, so at least it wouldn‚Äôt be an impulsive decision.

I really hate how much power my boyfriend‚Äôs words have had over me. It makes me feel weak. I am left feeling very volatile, reckless, and impulsive. And broken. Mostly broken.

I guess I‚Äôm just not sure where to draw the line in terms of feeling ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù Should I wait until I am genuinely wanting to die? What if it‚Äôs too late by then, and I don‚Äôt want to seek help? Is feeling sad and scratching up my arms enough, or will they scoff at me and ask if I‚Äôve tried meditating and going outside?

Anyways, that is all. If you made it all the way to the bottom, thanks for reading.

At first I thought that ""no way I have some autistic personality disorder, I'm fine, I'm just a loser"" I decided to try to forget about it and move on, after a week when I saw my psychiatrist and she also mentioned it and explained apsergers to me, it just hit like rock, every charasteric she described to me fit perfectly. 

Today I had a joint session with my doctor and psychiatrist and after while we reached the conclusion I have aspergers.

I don't know how to feel. I just feel numb. I feel like a fraud, all the charasterics fit but it just feels like a easy way out of my situation that I might actually have something wrong with me and it's just not me being a fucking loser and an idiot.

67,"zoloft and wellbutrin, different doses, on and off, starting like a year ago or something i don't even remember. started again recently. i had a surge of motivation and was going to kill myself, really wanted to, and i felt free and happy for the first time that i was going to take control of my life, and then the feeling DISAPPEARED and it's gone! WHY why this level of mood change??

i used to be smart. i had anxiety and social phobia but i was smart and honestly was probably depressed for the right reasons. the months of using these drugs, ever since i've been on them, i've become stupid, my brain has become quiet, i remembered all the bad things that happened to me before and yes i would ruminate, but now i barely remember them and THAT'S NOT GOOD, because i should know my story, now i can't even tell my story to people, i've turned into a stupid zombie who can barely remember the painful past, i need to know it, i don't want to be stupid and useless, before all this i had an excuse for being such a loser and being such nothing in life at this point, but now i can't even tell my excuse because i don't remember what it is anymore, and that ONLY makes things worse. 

i've gone from being a traumatized helpless victim who could tell you everything, give you all the reasons and events that made me that way, to being a person who hasn't done much and isn't headed anywhere and doesn't look like he has any reason for it. at least before i had a story, and it was TRUE. regardless of how sad and depressed and anguished i constantly felt, and my social phobias (i still can't talk to people btw, i just don't get insanely anxious in public anymore, i'm not going to ever make friends or connections with other human beings) what i was going through and what i felt was TRUE. now i don't even remember the truth. at least i had something back then. some type of integrity, some type of understanding. now my brain doesn't work anymore. this wasn't what i needed. i can't believe what my life has become, i feel so bad, and i hate myself and hate it. 

i had an identity before, now i'm less anxious and neurotic but my identity is gone. yeah no one knew it, fuck, who cares about people's perception of me, at least i was true. i'm not true anymore. i don't know what i am or what to fucking do. i don't even know how to word this properly. or if anyone's going to bother reading this wall of text. i even asked how i could kill myself on here a day ago or something and got a response from only one person. i don't know what to fucking do. there's nothing to live for and i had dreams before even though i was sad and anxious i had my own unique desires and aspirations and thoughts and i was me, now i don't even look forward to a possible future, maybe my fantasies of a better life were delusions of grandeur, one thing that going on meds taught me was that my mind was twisted because of how i grew up and experienced and that i wasn't important to society or mattered that much, which gave me motivation and reason, and made me feel far less bad about killing myself, but now i don't even feel like doing *that*. 

what am i? what the fuck am i and how do i feel? i wish i could get that surge of courage again. the worst part is that i don't know how it came and went, what triggered it, and how to get it back. the confusion and helplessness and blindness and fog and incomprehensibility of it all makes it so much fucking worse. no guideline, no direction, nothing. i can't go back and have a different life, i hope i can get the courage someday in the future to end it, because that's the one thing that gave me motivation lately. i'm useless and dumb and fucked up and trying to get help only made things worse and horrible for me. before i couldn't speak to people due to major anxiety and inner dialogue, now i speak to people slowly because i have no inner dialogue or thoughts like i used to, i used to be me and the reason i WAS me was because i experienced abuse at the hands of people and i understood what the world was like better than people who lived easier lives, i had wisdom from it, now i don't remember that wisdom, i've lost the biggest part of myself and now i'm more nothing than i was before. i don't even have an excuse anymore. did i already say that? fuck it, i'll stop typing here because i don't know how to communicate how the fuck i feel or don't feel or what feeling is or if i'm even capable of that or whatever the fuck, i just don't fucking know anymore.",08Mar2019,1
68,"So I have avoidant personality disorder and probably some mild depression. These last few days I've been feeling worse than usual, but I can't really put my finger on what it is or why it's like this. 

I wake up feeling anxious and completely stripped of any good feelings. It's not so bad that I can't get things done or get out of bed, but it's just a really empty feeling hanging over me. I guess I'm feeling like I'm just controlling a robot with no emotion. I can laugh and smile with my boyfriend for example, but inside I feel this deep hollowness as I do. I have not felt genuine excitement or happiness for years, but I also haven't felt really sad or suicidal.

I have been to a few different therapists for around 8 years with no luck in bringing me back to life. I also tried Fluoxetine (SSRI I think), but I had a really bad reaction to it and I don't think I want to experiment with any different antidepressants.

It's been a while since I saw a therapist, and I'm contemplating seeing one again. I'm just a bit unsure about what I can answer when they ask me what my goals for the treatment will be. What can they actually do for me if I'm not motivated to do anything? I don't know what I want to achieve other than happiness. I don't know how to get there though. 

And just to add: I sleep allright, I eat allright and I work out now and then.

Anyways, I'm just super confused. I just had a pretty bad panic attack over a situation that has never happened. I don't know what it is. It usually starts off like this.
It's late and I can't sleep, I just think and think and think and think. Unfortunately, painful memories replay every single night in my head over and over and over and over. It makes me cry, a lot. These memories also cause me to have panic attacks at night, I live in constant fear.
However, this is where I'm confused about, I've been thinking about those situations but for whatever reason, I've also been involuntarily thinking about new situations that are similar to my actual experiences but not quite.
 For example, to make a long story short, as a child, I was ""stabbed"" in the abdomen (it was only a cut but he meant to stab me). I fell because at the time, it was quite painful for me and for whatever reason he ran. My friends left me behind, so I was behind the neighborhood by myself with little bleeding, it wasn't anything serious but it scared me terribly.
 So, this new situation that's been plaguing my mind is quite similar however, I've been legitimately stabbed. 
It's like I'm reliving that fake memory, I feel the pain from the stab wound and I feel the fear from seeing so much of my own blood in that fake memory. I've also been reliving many other fake memories. I don't know why this happens but it's causing a lot of issues for me since it's starting to produce painful fake memories of people I love.

75,"Starting out, for context i'm a 17 year old male, in a central-european middle class family. 

I have a really tough time with my mind. I feel like it doesn't connect with me, like I can't control my thoughts sometimes.

I want to do things but it's like i'm stuck in a shell that is limiting me.

I love going out with friends, having fun and joking around and I want to be a really social person, but I have a really tough time actually putting my thoughts into words and I feel so dumb for it, so I rather keep quiet around people because I fear that I might embarrass myself.

Lots of times I have been called out as really quiet or serious, but I just can't think of anything to say. 

I just feel like I don't belong. My mind would rather be daydreaming about anything else. 

I even come off as rude or unconsiderate sometimes because i don't think my actions through or I just can't hide that that I'm really not interested in something. I really hate myself for this. 

I'm always really trying to be cautious about everything, because one of my biggest fears is ruining opportunities.

I like writing because I have lots of time to think about what I want to say and how I want to say it. It's the only time I can actually kinda express myself, but it takes a long time. 

I envy people who are good at improvising so much, because that is something that I would absolutely love to do, but I really struggle with it.

I just love being creative so much, but I feel so limited.

In elementary school I didn't really have a problem with studying, all I really remember is that I could do things well, but REALLY slowly. 

Looking back at old recordings even my talking would be weird and kinda slow-motion, which I kinda grew out of, but my friends say it still comes back sometimes. 

Now that I'm in highschool more and more problems are emerging. 

I don't mind paying attention when something interests me, I can spend hours being hyperfocused on something if I just found some new thing that interests me, but as soon as I lose interest I start daydreaming and thinking about anything else, and I can no longer focus.

I just can't pay attention even if I know it's important.

I procrasinate until the very last day, every time, because I cannot get myself to start working, because I have really poor self control and a really short attention span, and I would rather do anything else than what I have to do. Responsibilities are my worst enemy.

The only way I can read books, even if the story is good, is if I have the text in front of me, and the audio version playing at the same time, else I just get distracted by my own thoughts.

I don't like keeping still. I walk up and down in bus stops, I constantly express things with my hands when speaking, even if I'm talking online, fidget with my hands, tap with my feet. People sometimes say that it can be quite annoying to them.

I also have really bad memory. Everybody has those moments sometimes where they suddenly forget what they wanted to do a minute or a couple of seconds ago, but that is an everyday thing for me, sometimes multiple times a day, and it is really annoying. I keep repeating the thing I want to do in my head so I don't forget it, and I still manage to forget it. I even forget whole words sometimes when writing.

Another thing that happens sometimes, although not too often, is that I'm thinking about something or trying really hard to remember something and my mind just start to fill with multiple things at once and it's like my thoughts are ""overloading"", and i have to calm myself down before I can think straight again, because at that point everything in my mind is just a jumble. 

I also have a problem when I am left alone with just my thoughts, when I'm in bed for example. I can give myself unintentional panic attacks, so I have to do do something that I can think about until I just fall asleep.

I obsess over new and exciting things, and think about it for weeks and then just suddenly lose interest in it, even if I loved it. Games, books, history, music, movies, hobbies, they are all so exciting when new but I get bored of everything. It's just the worst, because every time that I find something new that I am passionate about I already know that no matter how much I like it now, after a month my brain will think it's no longer new and stimulating enough and I will start to hate it. I have also spent lots of money this way on things that I don't care about anymore.

I'm also: a perfectionist, a control freak, manipulative, kinda selfish (which I really hate about myself), and messy.

I'm self-aware but it's difficult to control these things for me.

I know this is a lot of things, and I don't mean to share my whole life story and bore everyone, but I really want to know if there is something wrong with me, and what could help me. I have hid all of these things from everyone in my life so far. 

I never got a diagnosis. I'm kinda afraid of seeking medical help, because I fear that it might affect my employment, or my social status, or my relationship with my family, and I also don't feel like people in my country (Hungary) really take mental health problems seriously.

76,"This is Part 1 (I'm still writing part 2).  
I use research from the best scientific journals and resources to inform my understanding of physiological functions and as the basis for my solution to conquering clinical depression and anxiety.  
When I am sharing my opinion I will do my best to state clearly that it is my opinion (based on my experience). 

I'm going to give my firm opinion on a few things:  
Clinical depression and anxiety can be cured. I am living proof. I know exactly how to do it and how to tailor the process for individuals suffering from clinical depression and anxiety.  
I write ""clinical depression and anxiety"" because the two are so heavily interlinked, it's highly likely if you suffer from anxiety you will suffer from clinical depression, and it's highly likely if you suffer from clinical depression you will suffer from anxiety. This is backed up by quality scientific research and easily explained - if I don't get the time to do so in this post, I'll make sure I explain it in part two. 

Clinical depression is a cluster of symptoms that destabilize the homeostasis of our brain and body, the symptoms are debilitating and effect one of the the most important parts of our physical being, our brain, and these symptoms, under the umbrella of clinical depression, function in a self fulfilling cycle that, sadly all to commonly, destroys the ability of a person to live their best life, and tragically all too commonly, destabilizes a person so intensely and so severely that they end their life.  

Alright so I‚Äôll try and keep this as brief and simple as possible.

To conquer depression we have to understand exactly what clinical depression is. To understand what clinical depression is we have to understand exactly what clinical depression affects. (Anxiety is part of this, but for now, I am writing specifically about clinical depression, but the information is useful because the two are so heavily interrelated). 

The three main things that clinical depression affects:

The Brain (as in the fleshy organ inside our skull)  
The mind (as in the non-physical thing that is who we are, our experience with the world, etc)  
The body (as in everything that we physically are, apart from the brain).  
  
The next important thing to understand is that every part of us that isn‚Äôt the brain exists to support the successful life of the brain. The primary job of our heart is not to make sure the our elbows, or our pinky fingers, or our hair is successful and healthy ‚Äì obviously this is a part of what the heart does, but the primary role of the heart is to support the brain. The same goes for everything else.  

The brain is an organ made of flesh that has no muscle or bone or cartilage. It is pretty much a big lump of nerves, aka neurons. Nerves transport messages. They transport messages using electricity and chemicals. The brain is the house of our mind which is our personal experience of the world.  
The brain and the mind are connected obviously. But what I want to make really clear here is that the brain as a physical thing is changed by other physical things ‚Äì and these changes inevitably affect our mind.

I want you to think of a projector ‚Äì like a movie projector. Our brains are like the physical box of the projector and all the wiring and such inside. Our minds are the projection up on the wall, coming from the projector.

Now I want you to understand that healthy adult brains do not change in size ‚Äì I want you to understand this because it‚Äôs important for my next point. Our brains, healthy adult brains, do not change in size, despite the continuous increase of information we gather throughout our lives. This has nothing to do with the saying ‚Äúwe only use such and such amount of our brain‚Äù what it means, what it shows, is that our brains are able to take in lots of information over time, without becoming cluttered, because our brains have a natural system that orders information based on value.

This is really important to understand. Read this slowly now. Our brains naturally value information and the value of a piece of information is based on how often it is used by the brain.

I will show you an example of what I mean.
I don‚Äôt want you to think of a red car.

Stop thinking about a red car.

I told you, do NOT think of a red car.

Why are you thinking of a red car?

You‚Äôre thinking of a red car because our brains naturally value information which is immediate to us.

It doesn‚Äôt matter that I am telling you NOT to think of a red car. What matters is that the action of thinking, or not thinking, of a red car, is immediate information that our brains must process. It‚Äôs up to us to say ‚ÄúOkay, I know I can‚Äôt NOT think of a red car when someone says don‚Äôt think of a red car, but what I can do, is accept the fact that I think of a red car, and just let that thought go by, whilst thinking about what other more interesting thoughts I have‚Äù.

The reason I‚Äôm explaining this is because it is fundamental to understanding how our brains work in terms of processing information, which is fundamental to our minds and our experience of life.

Every moment our brains and minds are processing information from our surroundings, but also processing our internal thoughts. It‚Äôs a lot of information and a lot of it is deemed by our brain not to be worthy of specifically noticing, or focusing on. This is normal, natural, and just the way our brains work.

We have two levels to our mind ‚Äì we have the immediate conscious experience which is what we deal with mostly‚Äì and then we have the lower conscious experience which is very important but we don‚Äôt deal with it a lot, or at least most of us don‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs just something that‚Äôs been there since the beginning, and nobody really talks about it.

Basically the lower conscious experience of our mind is information that our brains/minds consider to be just a bit less valuable than the information involved in the immediate conscious experience.

To put it really simple ‚Äì the lower conscious experience of our mind is where our self esteem and our personality live. It plays a big role in the cycle of depression and also in getting out of the cycle of depression. I‚Äôll go into that a bit more after I cover some other stuff.

Our thoughts physically exist. They exist in bits and pieces. These bits and pieces eventually make up a whole clear thought but for the sake of the explanation, let‚Äôs just call them bits and pieces. The bits and pieces are electrical and chemical. Essentially, they are the information that travels through the nerves of our sensory organs and into the nerves of our brain.

The most important thing to understand here is that the brain doesn‚Äôt have simplistic or set in stone nerve pathways.

The brain utilizes billions of nerves to create more complex information from the information we gather through our senses. What I am saying is this:

When I see a red rose I think of valentines day.

What happens when I see is a red rose is that the visual information goes along the nerves of the eye and into my brain. It‚Äôs just a red rose. The red rose itself does not belong to valentines day. It‚Äôs just a plant. But my mind creates more complex information from the information we gather through our senses. My brain, which has information about valentines day, connects the information of valentines day with the information of the rose and I experience the thought of not just the rose but also valentines day in my mind.

What all of this means is that, believe it or not, we are able to influence what we think and why we think it. And this is a wonderful thing but also a terrible thing. It is the reason why we have everything we have as humans but it‚Äôs also a big part of the reason why we suffer so much mental ill health. I will tell you more about how to deal with this towards the end.

As I said, the brain uses electricity and chemicals to function. The chemicals interact with the nerves which then create the electric pulse which then sends out another chemical from the nerve which interacts with another nerve and so on and so on.
One of the most well known chemicals is serotonin.

I‚Äôm gonna cut thru all the bull and give you the facts.
There is nothing magical about serotonin.

It‚Äôs just a neurotransmitter.

If you think of neurons as lazy buggers that just wanna stay in the physical place they are in but they still want to socialize then serotonin is the thing that takes a message from one neuron and delivers it to another neuron. That‚Äôs pretty much what all neurotransmitters do. They are chemicals, and they move around between neurons (nerves).

There‚Äôs lots of different neurotransmitters. Pretty much each neurotransmitter does a variety of functions ‚Äì which means it interacts with a variety of different neurons.

For example: The majority of serotonin in our body is in our digestive system because serotonin acts as the messenger between the automatic and slow moving muscles of our digestive system, and there's a lot of them, and serotonin is the big reason on how it works! But serotonin is also vital as a neurotransmitter for our brain.

But where does serotonin come from?

Serotonin is created in our bodies from food that we eat. It‚Äôs a chemical. And chemicals are just different combinations of pieces of matter ‚Äì as in ‚Äì the tiny molecules that make up our universe and everything. The reason why I am saying this is because serotonin doesn‚Äôt magically come from somewhere in our body, it‚Äôs something that can only be created within us if we ingest the materials needed to create it ‚Äì if we eat well. The chemical that is used to create serotonin is called tryptophan and it is available in a variety of different food sources. 

Here‚Äôs something really interesting though: Serotonin is the chemical that is needed in order for our bodies to create melatonin! And melatonin is a chemical, otherwise known as a neurotransmitter, which has a variety of functions, probably most importantly, it regulates our sleep patterns, it makes us feel sleepy.

The final chemical/neurotransmitter I want to quickly discuss is dopamine. Dopamine is often thought of as some kind of happy drug. It‚Äôs pretty much bull. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that has a variety of functions. For example, it is the messenger between nerves that control physical movement. The main source of what we use to create dopamine is a chemical called tyrosine. 

The process our brains and bodies use to create neurotransmitters is called biosynthesis. 

The biosynthesis of dopamine and serotonin requires iron, the mineral. This is essential to the process to creating serotonin and dopamine, if we don't have enough iron available, then we are predisposed to becoming ill with clinical depression and anxiety, because our body and brain cannot create serotonin and dopamine without sufficient iron, and without serotonin and dopamine, our body and brain cannot maintain balance and things go down hill. 

The reason I have written all of that is because it‚Äôs important to know why doctors say ‚Äúeat healthy‚Äù. Especially when they say it to patients suffering from mental illness. Sadly, it‚Äôs never really explained in the simple detail as I have.

So now we know that our brains require certain chemicals to function well. And a brain that functions well means our minds function well, because we know the two are linked. And we know that we get the chemicals our brain needs by eating a healthy diet.

Now I want you to understand something really important. The brain uses more energy than any other human organ ‚Äì it uses 20 percent of the total energy of a human, on average. We eat food that has particular molecules which neurons use to do what they do ‚Äì I‚Äôm not just talking neurotransmitters, I‚Äôm talking about energy, as in, fuel. The chemicals from the food we eat are taken to the brain via the bloodstream. Now here‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt think about often ‚Äì energy is never created nor destroyed. Why do I say that? Well it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs true and it‚Äôs super important to understanding our brains. Because our brains use up so much energy, so much fuel, the fuel doesn‚Äôt just disappear! Our brains create lots of waste ‚Äì what I mean is, there are heaps of leftover chemicals or molecules from the chemical reactions in the brain ‚Äì and many of these chemicals can interact with our neurons in bad ways, so these chemicals which were part of an important process, now need to be cleaned out. How does this happen?

SLEEP!
Yes! Sleep is not just ‚Äúrest‚Äù. It‚Äôs cleaning! I want you to think of it as cleaning from now and forever. Sleep is so massively vital, good sleep, because it is the main and most important way that toxic chemicals are cleaned from our brains. Here‚Äôs the good news though, if you don‚Äôt sleep well now, you do have time to fix that because our brains excrete a chemical which protects the neurons in our brain from the waste ‚Äì however, this chemical is limited, so prolonged chronic lack of sleep drains this protective chemical, which then means our brains are damaged by the toxic waste. Unless we get good sleep of course.

So NOW, when doctors say, eat well and sleep well, we know what they mean is:

Eat a healthy diet so that your brain can function to it‚Äôs healthiest potential, which means, YOU, functioning at your healthiest potential.

Make decisions to ensure you get good sleep (aka sleep hygiene) so that your brain is able to get a GOOD CLEAN every night and be nice and fresh for the next day ‚Äì which means, YOU will function at your healthiest potential.

Now I want you to understand this:

Our thoughts impact our feelings, our feelings impact our decisions, our decisions impact our behaviour, our behaviour impacts our existence, our existence impacts our thoughts, our thoughts impact our feelings‚Ä¶ and so on and so forth.

When I say our existence ‚Äì let‚Äôs think of two very important parts of our existence ‚Äì what we eat, and our quality of sleep.

Clinical depression is not one singular thing. It‚Äôs not a broken finger bone. Or a pimple.

The definition of clinical depression is:  

Clinical depression is an illness, a medical condition. It significantly affects the way someone feels, causing a persistent lowering of mood.  
Depression is often accompanied by a range of other physical and psychological symptoms that can interfere with the way a person is able to function in their everyday life. The symptoms of depression generally react positively to treatment.  

As you can see, it‚Äôs a few different things. But I want to make it really clear, clinical depression is a cycle that sustains itself unless we know how to breakfree from that cycle. 

Depression is a cycle. It‚Äôs a few different things in different areas of who we are that can exist by themselves, but when they also have a tendency to impact each other, and to fuel each other. I‚Äôll break it down.

The cycle of depression can look like this:

I don't eat because I hate myself.

The reason why I hate myself is because I slept all day and accomplished nothing.

The reason why I slept all day is because I was unable to sleep the night before due to anxiety, fear, anger, frustration, and hunger.

The reason why I felt anxious, fearful, angry, and frustrated, is because of intrusive thoughts and feelings of guilt, insecurity, confusion, and hopelessness. I felt hungry because I was crippled by so much anxiety I couldn't go to the shops to get food without having a panic attack dismantle me to the very core of my being, I felt guilty for not being strong enough, and I felt confused and hopeless because I didn't know why this was happening to me or how to overcome it. 

Then I hate myself for suffering all of this, and because of that, I don't eat. At that point I just want to die and stop being a burden to myself and everyone around me. And the cycle continues. 

Thoughts of insecurity and guilt and confusion and fear came from something ‚Äì it‚Äôs different for everyone, but we are all insecure, or guilty, or confused, or fearful throughout our lives ‚Äì these feelings are generally linked to something specific, and the situation or the feeling is resolved. We move on. However, with depression, people often feel like they can‚Äôt escape these feelings, and they can‚Äôt move on, and after a while, they may not even know why they feel those feelings.

Those feelings contribute to behaviour which creates a malnourished and unclean brain. The malnourished and unclean brain then has to work extra hard to do basic things. The experience of being unable to do basic things as easy or as normal as we once were able to contributes to feelings of fear, anxiety, uselessness, dejection, and ultimately a loss of all hope. These feelings contribute to behaviour which creates a malnourished and unclean brain.

So that‚Äôs one common and typical example of the cycle of clinical depression and anxiety, and those are some common and typical examples of the catalysts for how people enter the cycle of clinical depression and anxiety.

lately though i feel like i‚Äôve been really depressed. a bad day turns into a bad week, my self esteem and internal monologue are very negative and now it‚Äôs all just a kind of blur. 

i am still getting on with a lot of different things and being fairly productive which differs greatly from when i‚Äôve had depressive episodes before so i‚Äôm not really sure how to deal with it. i keep telling myself ‚Äúyou got out of bed today, you saw a friend today, you had a bath etc so you can‚Äôt be that bad‚Äù but the feelings of worthlessness, self loathing and constantly being on the edge of tears just aren‚Äôt going away. i don‚Äôt know whether i just need to wait it out and am just going through a tough time, or if it is more than that.

i feel like i‚Äôm losing myself and i really don‚Äôt know what to do. i‚Äôve reached out to local counselling services but even the private ones are booked solid with a huge waiting list. it took me months of therapy to finally get to a point of sanity, and i can‚Äôt bear the thought of having to go through that all over again. i feel like all my progress has been lost and i don‚Äôt know how to cope.",08Mar2019,1

80,"I saw a post on here while I was googling something regarding how to get out of a depressive and anxious slump.  


I was wondering if there were any really good peer reviewed workbooks that help people who need to get their life back in order. I'm sick and tired of being tired and unable to cope with adult life.  


Here's some backstory if it would help with picking a book or two:  


Basically, I've come from a family of alcoholics with no Father figure, and a mother who has mental health issues, physical illnesses as well as narcissism. I'm currently 29, and I'm severely stunted in where I want to be. After graduating from University, I've become stuck in my family house after returning home and have no friends around me and nowhere to go in a city with nothing to do.  


I can't even bring myself to get out of the house. I find every excuse to just sit on my ass and do nothing and will find ANYTHING to do nothing. Even writing this post. I need help. Seriously. It's getting to the point where it's affecting my physical health despite my working out and eating healthy.  


I have things I like, but I just can't bring myself to do them. Sitting here playing games that make me feel like I've achieved something are what I do all day, even if I hate the game. I've deleted some of them cold turkey to find myself going back to that familiar comfort.",08Mar2019,3

83,"I've been under mental health services for years (I'm 25 now). I've been med free for over a year now and in some ways I do feel better. I can cook, clean, look after myself etc and people are noticing that. However, I'm miserable most of the time. I think people are comparing me to when I was a sedated mess and thinking I'm good now.  

I see my care coordinator once a month but don't say any of things that are happening or worrying me. Voices tell me to shut up, don't talk, stop talking, they are evil, don't trust them, it's a test, it's tricks, it's riddles, shut up, listen carefully. In the past I've been involuntarily medicated. That's still a worry so I don't even mention small things. Every time I say everything is fine. Stupid I know.  

It's looking like I could be discharged from services soon. It might work out okay but I'm still having a miserable time. I spend every day in headphones in the dark to block everything out. I can't live the rest of my life like this. I think I've wasted mine and everybody's time saying everything is fine. I think it's too late to ask for help now. Even if I had the chance I'd probably end up saying everything was fine.  

I'm not sure what to do.",08Mar2019,1
84,"Hi, 

I'm a 29 year old male, living in the UK.

I find that I am struggling with my mental health, I don't know where to begin, so apologise if i don't seem entirely coherent and happy to clarify anything, this is gonna be a big post, but i feel like i need to speak to someone who may have some insight or at least have an idea on what it's like to be me, going to give some background on my past, and my behaviour and how i feel. If this is the wrong subreddit, I apologise and will remove and post elsewhere.

I've had a bit of a chaotic life, not as much as others, but enough to make it strange, and difficult to bear with sometimes, but i feel myself slowly unwinding and fearing that i'm going to lose my sanity.

###¬†Child Abuse
I was sexually abused as a child a few times, by the same person, I can't remember exactly how old, but i think it was at 6-7 and again at 11 by the same person (not my parents). I never told anyone, not until I was 25, I don't know why, i was embarrassed, ashamed - I tried to just get on, i feel almost like i didn't even realise the gravity of what happened when it did happen, i guess that added to it.

### Bullying

I suffered bullying throughout school, and to a great degree, no-one else i saw suffered as much as me, I was constantly ganged up on from year 2 to year 7, luckily it died down a lot when i changed schools to secondary, but primary school was very difficult, I still have memories on groups of boys holding my arms and legs whilst they took turns punching and kicking me and the schools never doing anything, instead calling me disruptive (which i may have been sometimes) and a trouble maker. I'd be told go back to your own country, etc...

however, i never started anything i just reacted to people, I felt so alone, I had no friends aside from one, who i am still in touch with these days, but even at a young age, he was the only one who would talk normally to me compared to everyone else.

I even remember my year 2 teacher already writing me off, she hated me, tell me i was going to be a rubbish man or a road sweeper, absolutely horrible things to say to such a young child, but i didn't know why, i never knew why. 

### Violence at home

My dad, whom i love to bits and miss every day, unfortunately, was psyicallly abuse with me and my brother, a trope passed on from Portugal i guess, as psychical violence against children is quite common to educate them and teach them ""discipline"", so throughout growing up, when i misbehaved, i would get beats, usually with the palm of the hand or with a leather belt, I remember one ocassion, there was a church mass from my school with parents and kids, and all the kids had to go up and kiss the statue of jesus's feet, I was about 6 at the time I can't fully remember, but I found this a bit nasty, i didn't want to kiss where all the other kids did, so i pretended to do it when it was my turn, but didn't actually do it. The priest told my dad, and when i got home i got the back of my legs whipped with a thorned rose stem.

There are so many ocassions i was hit, it's almost normalised to me, I've been hit with thorned rose stem, leather belts, wooden spoons, broom handles, the works, so I always feared my dad, we had aside from this form of punishment a relativley normal life. Aside from the fact I was abused too, which my parents never found out about, my mom still doesn't know, and my dad went to his grave never knowing.

###¬†Getting kicked out

At 19, I was still living with my parents, by this point i was no longer beaten, obsviously with times changing and it becoming more unacceptable, this diminished in my house. anyway, at one point my parents had a cousin ask to come live with us temporarily from portugal, to which they agreed, and this cousin ended up poisoning my dad against me to the point where i was kicked out one night, because i asked my mom to pick me up from the train station after a work outing (i was sober).

This was very difficult and was the begining of a trail of debt i would build up which i'm still paying off now. Anyway I was able to stay with one of my best friends at the time, until i found a place a few days later, my dad eventually realised that he was played by my cousin and kicked me out for very little reason, because of bullshit my cousin had fed him, my parents told that cousin to leave and asked me to come back. At this point, i had already put down money for a place, and kind of wanted to experience living on my own, but i reconciled with my dad, I hate conflict, i love my family, i didn't want to be estranged. And everything was just dandy.

### Dad passing away

Fast forward 2 years, I'm 21, I had been with a fiance for a couple of years, and we wanted a change from the dreary UK so we planned with my parents to move back to our family home in Portugal. 2 months before my fiance and i moved to Portugal, my Grandma passed away, my mom and I went to Portugal for the funeral, and when we land we get a phonecall, My dad had a massive stroke and was on the way to the hospital. We were distraught, we tried getting straight on a plane back, but there was nothing available, so we went paid our respects to my grandma and managed to get a return flight the following morning at 5am. It was too late, my dad suffered several more strokes on the way to the hospital. My aunts were the last to speak to him, the last words i know my dad said were, ""I'm scared"". Even writing this now, i'm holding back tears.

This affected my family and I hugely, I still ended up moving back to Portugal, although just my fiance and I, i made the mistake of going anyway, as i could not stay with all the memories, but left my brother and my mom, here, I called every day. and missed them, but being back in Portugal helped, but now i wonder if it only temporarily helped me cope.

###¬†Fued between my mom and my wife

6 months after my dad passed away, my mom had met someone, me and my brother were very very apprehensive about this, we thought it was just too soon. and did not want to meet the person or deal with them until we were ready, our mom didn't listen and forced it, my wife in an attempt to defend my brother and i, ended up getting into an argument with my wife which ended up with them not being on speaking terms for 4 years, this caused a lot of issues between my wife and I, she tried to get me to stop talking to my mom, but i simply couldn't, i had already lost my dad, i didn't want to lose my mom.

I know some people might point fingers at my wife, but she had a bit of a fucked up childhood too, so i don't fully blame her. But this caused me substantial stress, as i felt like i was in the middle of them, and that my wife was trying to control who i talk to.

###¬†Derealisation as a child

As a child, reality always seemed so bizarre to me, almost like it wasn't real, i was just a kid though, but i always had issues with understanding reality and grasping it, this went away eventually however, but it was a very surreal experience, i don't know how else to describe, some people say it's like you're living a movie or a dream, i don't know, but it seemed much more profound than that to me, bearing in mind I experienced this when i was about 5-8 years of age.  Then it just kind of went away and life went on.

### Addiction issues

When i was 13 and living in Portugal, I made a couple of friends who introduced me to smoking, a habbit that even after all these years I have not managed to kick, I try and try, and i will sometimes go clean for a while, but then it's like when i'm presented with the opportunity, the person in me that wants to make a change just disapears.

When I was 23, I went to Amsterdam on a trip, I was living in the UK again, and went with my wife that i had married in Portugal (the fiance that moved there with me) and I tried weed properly for the first time, I had tried it a few times in the past, but never properly gotten high.

Well, I got very very very high, We ordered some Amnesia haze and proceeded to smoke 3 pure joints between us, I felt like i had transcended to another reality, and it was one of the best experiences i had ever had. I didn't have weed again for around 6 months.

6 months after my trip to Amsterdam, I wanted to try weed again (against the wishes and behind the back of my wife, yes i know, i'm an asshole) it had gotten rid of all the pain and anxiety that i had learned to tolerate. And gave me a clarity that i had never experiences, I was able to think on much deeper levels, I felt like i had been a husk up until that point and never truly been objective until then.

I found how i could get a supply here in the uk, and started smoking every chance i could, initially spacing it out, but as i continued, the time between smoking became less and less. I started abusing it, I don't blame weed for any stoner out there who wants to say it's not addictive or harmful. It can be, anything in excess can, and things can be addictive, I am addicted to weed, I'm addicted to the escape.

###¬†Psychedelic uses

A couple of years ago, I tried psychedelics for the first time, mushrooms specifically, and had a similar experience to when i first tried weed, i really enjoyed it, then i got too cocky and tried LSD, I had a very large dose for someone with such limited experience i took 250ug (micrograms) and smoked some weed whilst i was peaking, and all of the trauma i've experienced in my life came to the forefront, it made me realise i had been burying things deep inside my whole life. Long story short, i had a little bit of a psychotic break induced by the intensity of all of these things, again, I don't blame the drug, it was my fault, i broke all of the unwritten rules on harm reduction. Luckily, it all went fine in the end and i came back, I have since had psychedelics again, but have been much more careful, and lowered any doses i did take.

For anyone who wants to blame the drugs for the way i feel, there is no point, i felt like this and worse before i took any drugs, and literally only tried weed twice in my teens.

For a long time, i thought i was just getting on with things, but i've slowly come to realise how much it' affects me, how my personality has been shaped, the fact I have a lot of issues with overeating and self control. Is something wrong with me? What can i do? What should i do? I feel like i'm on a slow spiral towards insanity sometimes. But i have anxiety, and social anxiety as well as depression.

I'm aware i should stop taking all drugs, and i do not take psychedelics regularly, but i have an issue with my weed addiction, i can't seem to get it under control no matter how hard I try. Luckily, I earn pretty well, as somehow with all of this stuff happening i managed to learn how to code, so i make a decent living as a software engineer, but my addiction has caused me to rack up 5k worth of debt despite the fact i'm already earning well.

I live in the UK, so mental health support isn't great, and all the NHS do is give CBT which just doesn't work for me, happy to try private too, but my financial situation isn't the best at the moment, luckily i'm working on that with my mrs.

I tried to add as much as possible about my and my background above, to provide insight into myself. Let me know if there is anything i can clarify, unfortunately, not something i can add a TLDR to.

In addition to the above, i've also moved around a lot, for reference;

Born in Portugal 1989
Moved to UK in 1992
Moved back to Portugal in 2003 with parents
Moved back to UK in 2006 with parents
Moved back to Portugal in 2011 with Fiance

86,"Hi, 24 years old female here. I know I'm weird, but I'm curious as to what is wrong with me exactly? I was seeing a therapist but, uhm, I don't think she was very good, in fact she didn't help at all, no offence to any professionals out there.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm 24 and finishing university this year. I'm not sure how to start this... if you need to know **anything about me, please ask and I'll answer honestly.**

&amp;#x200B;

I moved to another country almost 4 years ago. All of my friends are the ones I met in my childhood/teenage years. I wasn't able to make any lasting friendships in my new place. It's strange, I had friends from day 1 here, but then I didn't, some of them turned on me after a romantic fiasco with a certain guy (they were his friends), others still call themselves ""my friends"" but we rarely speak and never even meet. I had one good friend but she started having serious health problems, and we just can't see each other any more. It's sad, but doesn't look like it's going to improve any time soon. I am a social, extroverted (mostly) person, I tried hard to meet new people, but even if they liked me I just didn't like being with them, I felt I was forcing myself to enjoy hanging out with those new people... eventually I realized I am happier on my own. I haven't hanged out with a human being that does not belong to my family for 6 months now. In the summer I was able to visit my old friends, which are still cool, but here I'm a hermit and... it does not bother me that I am. Sometimes I get lonely in a romantic sense, been dating people, but there was not one person I clicked with. I chat with my old friends daily using the internet and it seems to be enough for me, minus that romantic side of things.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I think I have some problems with affect. You know, psychopath-style. My family always had pets, right? What is one supposed to feel when a pet dies? I don't feel anything. Every time that happened I had to fake tears etc. just to not stand out. I have very little problems lying. I'm a very good liar, I think. And I lie a lot. I know it's not right but it does give me this thrill, it feels good to lie. I lie mostly in small things, but sometimes bigger things as well if I need to. It's bizarre, but if I say a lie enough times, it's like I start to believe it, it gets more real than my actual memory of the thing. Maybe that's why it's so easy to lie for me. Am I manipulative? Sort of. Not in a malevolent sense. I don't get off hurting people. But when I want something, I can act in a very manipulative fashion. I read people very easily, I know how they feel, why they feel that way, what do they want etc. so it's easy for me. I'm not sure how my empathy works. I feel bad for my friends, for example, sometimes for strangers, but sometimes I act with callousness that doesn't make sense in the context of my personality (at least from my perspective). I said I don't get off hurting people, but I sometimes do. I like the feeling of power. I just don't go around hurting people for fun, it's more of a situational thing.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom says I have Aspergers but I don't think so. Aspergers can't read people well, the opposite of me. Aspergers don't understand humour all that much, again unlike me. I do have -some- Asperger/autistic traits, I can get obsessive with my work easily, I have some weird hobbies/quirks that have to do with numbers/maths, like an Asperger likely would. I can get mad, it's embarassing, but every now and then I can have an almost child-like meltdown. Anyway, I don't think my mom is right.

&amp;#x200B;

I have depression diagnosed, I am on SSRIs, they work, so I stick to them. It's been \~6 years. I tried getting off them, not a good idea, my mood is all over the place, I get angry easily, I get suicidal thoughts. It's just better taking them.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to say...I'm fairly smart, good imagination, good sense of humour, rather short tempered, have a risk-seeking tendency, rather lazy, like a challenge, have a tendency for being a little grandiose (but I'm fairly sure it's way below narcisstic levels), extroverted, fairly confident, get bored very easily, like to learn new things.

&amp;#x200B;

So...any ideas?",08Mar2019,2
87,"I went to the casino this week with $150, and I just kept winning. First, I won $680, then $790, then lost all of it except $360, came back another day then won back what I lost and was at $1,500 again, was satisfied with making what I lost back and was about to leave and go home, but I decided ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and went back to the Blackjack table and I won... $3,000.

89,"To sum it up, I‚Äôve been with this boy since the end of eighth grade and we have been going on for almost 11 months. Like all bad relationships, it started of great and then turned wrong. In the very beginning I had a best friend who I had known since kindergarten, she was dating his best friend and we all went on double dates together and it was probably the best months of my life. But what we knew was coming finally happened, and she had to move states. From then on out I was the worst I‚Äôd ever been and my boyfriend became his worst to. He pressured me into sending photos and that was the first, biggest red flag. He talked about girls he used to like or found hot to make me mad when he needed to or just to joke and make me upset. I truly don‚Äôt even know why. He was very jealous and protective, but those were the main problems only then. Our relationship now is nothing but fighting. He will yell at me over the smallest of things, degrade me of all my self worth, and scream the nastiest of things at me. He‚Äôs fake broke up with me so many times and every time he‚Äôll wait till I‚Äôm in tears and he says he was kidding, and every single time no matter how horrible of what he‚Äôs said or even if the fight wasn‚Äôt my fault, the second he‚Äôs not mad at me, I stop crying and I act like nothing happened. Because I will do anything to try and avoid him being mad at me. He will accuse me of liking somebody and yell at me for being a no good cheater, but he‚Äôs bluntly said how he‚Äôs liked the girl I‚Äôve always been worrying about while we are dating or how he‚Äôs catching feelings for someone else, how this person looks so much better than me and how I‚Äôm to fat or to skinny, and just list all of my insecurities. He makes sure to do this when he knows he‚Äôs loosing a fight, just to make me weak. 

I have developed bulimia (when you throw up your food) and anorexia because of him. He always said I was to skinny so I ate till I gained weight and I then started to hate my image so I resorted to throwing up. I‚Äôve become so depressed to where I‚Äôve self harmed. When he finds this out instead of comforting me he yells at me. Mental illness is just attention to him. 

He‚Äôs often like this only over the phone, but if he‚Äôs angry at me in person he will squeeze my hand till I yell, and grab or punch my thigh and arm until I bruise. My friends have tried so hard to get me out of this situation but I refuse, they have even admitted to giving up on me and just staying out of it because im so stubborn about it. I know what I‚Äôm in, I know how wrong and messed up it is, but I love him. Is this love? No, but in my world I‚Äôm just used to it and it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for our relationship. I can‚Äôt imagine breaking up with him and hurting him like he hurts me, because I know how much it sucks... He‚Äôs even said to me, the reason he treats me like this is because he knows I won‚Äôt leave, because I‚Äôm weak. And it‚Äôs so true. And I just listen to him say that and do nothing but try and silence my cries. I‚Äôve pushed away friends, family, help. But through all this I still stay because when he‚Äôs not the monster he is, he‚Äôs the sweetest thing. He can be the reason I‚Äôm depressed but at the same time the only reason I‚Äôm happy.

(Mind you iv been a stay at home mom for 2+ years, because he didnt want me to get a job) it's been really hard for me to get in my own groove again. i feel like some days I loss myself in my emotions and other days I'm my normal happy self.

Beforehand I was just a little afraid because they were bigger than me at the time (5-7 years old) but I had a traumatic event that made it really bad. everyone in my family knows the event and make fun of it, but to me it really traumatized me and sometimes brings a tear to my eye when I think about it. 

My parents always knew that I was afraid of dogs, just not to the extent. They just told me their is nothing to be afraid of and that if they harm you you defend yourself. While this is ok advice they don‚Äôt know the extent of it. All rationality goes out the window when I am near a dog. I live in fear each time I go on a walk or a hike. It‚Äôs really disabled my ability to live normally. 

I told them the extent of the fear a few months ago. They understood and said they would look into behavior therapy or something. Nothing happened. They forgot the next day and completely ignored it. It took a lot of effort to open up about it, primarily due to the fact my dad is ashamed of it. He still doesn‚Äôt understand the extent and I feel like a huge failure and that I‚Äôm just a pussy because that‚Äôs how he acts I‚Äôm like. I quit going on morning walks with him, last time I ran like fuck away from a dog and he laughed at me for it. I kinda don‚Äôt blame him it was just a little dog but that instinct in me takes over.

113,"For the past three years, I (21F) have been having episodes of crazy health anxiety (it mostly happens during exams or when something important is coming up). I literally spend hours googling stuff (even though I know it's really bad for me), watching videos of people who have terminal illnesses, overthinking about how I probably have something bad and how I don't wanna die now etc. 

During these ""periods"" I go to the doctor a lot, I get my blood tested for no reason (I literally just go to the lab and ask for blood test without a prescription), I cry all the time, I check every single part of my body (mostly lymph nodes and beauty marks). The problem is that all of that results in my having little to no sleep, so then I can't focus on studying and I make myself sick by thinking I am sick. 

Do you guys have any advice to stop these episodes?

Then I Had to go back to one of my old jobs because no one in my shit area would hire me despite having great interviews(besides one) and it bums me out because I said I would never work for them again after everything I went through with them.

117,"Let me introduce myself. My name is Coffee, and I admit that I have struggled greatly with anger in my life. In order for this to be understood, and why I realized my anger was consuming me, I have to explain what happened.

I lost a good friend because of some serious issues that had always been there. I asked for a single break, and he blew up on me. He came at me saying all these awful things, and I finally reached a breaking point. I *reacted*, I spat back. I sent him a text everyone told me not to, because I couldn't control my anger. I'd always controlled my emotions, fearing about the repercussions of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I couldn't control my anger in this situation. Years of dealing with hostility and feeling like I was wrong in every way, I couldn't control myself as I sent that text. The text that I wish to this day that I had never sent. I wanted him to understand just how harmful he was, how much pain he had inflicted, and had always.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned later that he would use my reaction as proof of my own 'craziness'. That I was the true problem. He had mutual friends watching every post I made, sneaking into my life without consent. And I allowed him to creep into my mind, all hours of the day and night. I became obsessed with figuring out what he was doing, and trying to figure out why.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would a close friend do such things?

Why would a close friend go out of their way to cause so much harm?

&amp;#x200B;

Questions that I would never get answers to. Because in order to gain accountability from another person, that other person must be willing to take steps to  change. But you, *you as a single person reading this*, cannot force another nor expect people to do something they are either unwilling to do or unable.

&amp;#x200B;

We don't always get closure in the way we want and the way we need. We won't always get that apology we desire to calm our minds and souls. And I am sorry to have to say that, truly. I know what it feels like to keep waiting to hear someone apologize for harming you and hearing nothing after. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, the best thing that we could do is pick up the pieces. Have mercy on yourself, I know mistakes are made in times of extreme pain, but you must believe that you can find a way to create a new life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've struggled with anger that has turned into resentment, bitterness, hatred. It was only just last night that I realized that I don't want to be that kind of man.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to hold onto hate, I don't want to feel that festering feeling of anger. Waking up angry isn't a pleasant experience to me. It was after watching a YouTube video that I knew that I had to be the change, I can't expect the people that hurt me to change.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot control what another person does, but I can handle and change myself. I am in charge of my destiny, not them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in charge of my image, not them.

&amp;#x200B;

*I am in charge of my peace, closure and life.*

&amp;#x200B;

The road ahead of me is going to be very rough. I've had some pretty dark days since the break up, yet I've had some great ones too. And I will continue to live and learn from people, places, situations. Each time provides another lesson to me, and teaches me how to be more compassionate towards other people.

&amp;#x200B;

Learning how to turn anger into compassion has been a very hard struggle for me. There will be times that I will want to dismiss my decision to let my fury and pain go, there will be times I won't understand why I decided to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I will remember what my face looked like in the mirror last night, and I will know that the reflection is of a man that I never want to be again.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be someone my grandmother could have looked at and taken pride in; I want to be that man that I can look at and not feel scared of. Because we're all struggling in this life, I don't want to cause more pain for another human being. I want to help people, not hurt them and in order to do that, I must learn to control my anger.",08Mar2019,1

recently, i've been super down and stressed. after graduating college i had a hard time finding a permanent job and started really doubting myself. i finally found a job and i do not like it at all. i'm basically a personal assistant which is never what i saw myself doing or had in mind for myself ( honestly not trying to sound elitist or make anyone else with this job feel bad, i just put a lot of pressure on myself and can't help but feeling like my honors STEM degree and student debt is all for nothing). anyways, my office has a lot of internal beef. my supervisor (whose assistant i am) and their director HATE each other and like to put me in the middle of their feud. my supervisor undermines my work, doesn't respect my opinions or suggestions, and sometimes makes me feel stupid with her harsh critiques.

i am not at all passionate or even remotely interested in the work i am doing. spending all my time and energy getting ready for/ commuting to/ working at a job i don't like is really taking its toll on me. yeah undergrad definitely had its struggles, but i was busy, challenged, motivated, and liked the stuff i was working on. i have none of that now. 

people just say its post-grad depression. when i talk about my job people just say stuff like ""just do fun stuff after work"" and ""its work its not supposed to be fun"" and my personal fav ""just cheer up."" holy cow, why didn't i think of that. i feel drained after work and don't want to be bothered and can't imagine myself remaining this unhappy for years to come.  

its getting harder and harder to hide my facade and pretend to enjoy or care about things. even outside of work, i just want to be alone, cry, sleep, and watch tv. i understand this really isn't helping, but trying to go out and interact makes me feel so drained. aside from the lack of social energy, i've been stressed, moody, sad, detached, etc. i've even been experiencing some health problems like bad eating habits, weight gain from stress eating, headaches, etc. 

i went to a doctor about some of the physical side effects and let my mom know because i needed my new insurance information for the appointment (i'm in my 20s and on my parents health insurance). 

talk of doctors appointments, avoiding family, random outbursts into tears, moodiness, weight gain, etc. and my mom automatically assumes pregnancy. shes came right out and asked once before and now she just hints at it in a not so subtle way, asking if i have anything i need to share and should just let her know so she can be there for me as i 'figure out my next steps.' 

i keep trying to tell her in a polite way i'm just in a bad mental space and that's it but she doesn't really see how i can be this upset because i don't like my job. she tells me things like ""well i don't like my job either, you just get up and go because you have too"" and ""you make decent money, just stick it out for a while and apply for other stuff."" she just doesn't understand. its more than just not liking my job, its feeling like a failure and like i've settled and that adulting is a scam.

i know i'm young and still have plenty of time in life but i've always been the time of person with an end-game in mind, i like setting goals and accomplishing them, i like working hard, i like being busy and feeling fulfilled and passionate about things. i don't know what i'm doing in my life or what i am working towards and that is the problem. 

i know my parents would be upset i was pregnant (i've moved out and am financially independent but they'd be disappointed because i'm still young and unmarried), but weirdly enough i think they'd be more upset by knowing the truth. being a minority, we don't really talk about mental health in my family. how do i tell my parents/grandparents who overcame racism, prejudice, chronic illness, death of a child, poverty, death of a spouse, etc. that i don't want to leave my apartment because i'm unmotivated and unattached and feel like a failure. i honestly think everyone in my family would look at me crazy if i said i was depressed. i feel guilty for even feel like this i should be grateful right? 

please any advice.

I've had big memory problem and lack of awereness in my surroundings for a couple of years. I bump into a lot of people because I dont look around or behind me or I dont listen for the presence of them. I always get hurtful comments like ""watch where youre going"" or ""dont you realise what youre doing?"". I sometimes start walking in the middle of the street because I dont realise I left the sidewalk and I almost got run over a couple of times. Sometimes I get up an hour later before going to school because I, for some reason, see a different time on the clock. And every now and then I get ready for school, take my shower, eat breakfeast and hop on the bus only to realise we are saturday the second I get to school. I also have a very bad memory problem. I always forget that my girlfriend works on thursdays and fridays. I even forget basic information like what time we are or what day we are.

This morning, friday, my school was canceled, my friends reminded me (thankfully) so I didnt go to class. But somehow, in my dumb stupid head, my brain thought that we were Saturday because it was a day that I didnt have school. I had plans for saturday evening, and it took me literaly three hours of preparing for it, to realise that we were only friday. I told my girlfriend and she got mad at me telling me I got a mental problem. She always gets mad but I dont want to tell her that she is very hurtful sometimes she even told me once that she might breakup with me one day for that.

Now dont get me wrong she is a very nice girl and I love her more than anything in the world. She doesnt mean all the bad things she says to me.

134,"Hello I‚Äôve (23F) been hospitalized multiple times before for suicide attempts and depression. I have a mental health disorder that has a lot of influence on my moods. I constantly feel depressed and frequently feel suicidal. 

I‚Äôve given suicide considerable thought the past two days. I feel like it is inevitable. Meaning I know I WILL die from suicide. I‚Äôm basically just delaying the inevitable. 

I know that probably no one on here would give me tips on how to best kill myself with causing the least amount of harm to the only two people that that love me. I don‚Äôt want to focus on my sob story or anything. I just need advice. 

I want to die. I know this. I feel it in my bones. My  question is this: should I go to the hospital or try to push through it? The reason why I‚Äôm writing this is because the hospitals I‚Äôve been to haven‚Äôt really worked for me. I mean I‚Äôm not dead I guess so technically they have worked. But I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out how to keep from getting back into suicidal thoughts. 

I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm really worth going to the hospital. I feel like it‚Äôs basically a waste of time for them and for me. I know I‚Äôm going to kill myself eventually, so why delay it? I don‚Äôt want to hurt my family. But I‚Äôve been suffering for the greater majority of ten years with depression and thoughts (and actions) of wanted to die. 

Are there any alternatives to the hospital? Should I just go?

Have been traumatised from a young age and family was abusive though it stopped the past few years.

my family had a sitdown with me a month ago and spoke to me asking whats wrong and why I never was close to them and how I didn't seem to love them.

Throwback to a week ago I felt a wake up moment,I realized I feel nothing towards then,nor hatred nor love.I think if my father dropped dead I would care but I wouldn't be really sad.

I have also noticed A few wierd things about me:
-Feel nothing
-enjoy manipulating people
-tortured a cat and felt pleasure(not sexual pleasure)
-Always acting and lying
-Very selfish and only care about myself
-Can turn on and off my emotions
-Always gaslight people
-Clever(score straight A's in school while barely studying)
-Can read people's emotions quite easily

My father is also a sociopath(mother told me)

I want to seek a psychologist to see whats wrong with me but I dont really care nor want to change,just shocked how I never realised all of my actions were against society norms.Not to mention how my mother is against that because ""if I take prescribed meds I will become a vegetable""",08Mar2019,1

I have some friends from college but they're far away and we haven't seen each other for more than a year.

 They're not much into texting or emails either, and I am not sure there's still friendship between us. Surely they must have moved on. 

I'm feeling like this isolation is starting to affect other aspects of my life negatively. I can never focus on anything, so I'm mostly binge-watching something just to hear other people talk, even if none of it is real. Or I'm surfing mindlessly. I don't sleep very well either, and I'm eating way too much sugar. 

I've also started drinking. I've finished a bottle of liquor in three days and the only thing stopping me from buying another one is being short on cash. Maybe it's not much, but I've never drunk alone or in the daytime before.

I got 2 tattoos on my forearms (bad decisions), ive gotten high everynight for 3 months, and ive had mood swings like fucking crazy. I go on impulsive swings where i sell all my shit and start over. I sold my pc, bought an xbox and tv, sold the xbox and tv and bought another pc, sold the pc and bought an xbox and tv again. Ive also been a horror at work. Today for example i was having a wonderful day until 2:00 where all of a sudden i felt numb and depressed. I ignored people and didnt give a shit. I felt so numb and down that my boss sent me home for my mood. It came out of no where. Now im sitting home and just chugged captain morgan (rip). Anyways i have been a trainwreck for the past 6 months. I got into weed and nicotine products hardcore and just feel numb all the time. When i get yelled at i just die inside now. I dont react the way i used to, im just numb. I isolate myself from society by hiding in the bathroom when im at college.

139,"This is going to be really hard to write because it's been going on for so long that it's like thinking about death, it's difficult for the brain to comprehend. I'll try my best to put it down into words even though I don't think there's enough words in my small brain to say how I feel.
For longer than I can remember, I've felt broken. My soul has been split into so many conflicting parts that trying to piece together who I am has been impossible and even the thought of it exhausts me,which is probably why it's taken me so long to try to address it or say it out loud. To put it simply I don't know who I am. I don't mean for this to sound like I'm trying to be profound or poetic, because that's not how I do things. I'm a moron, but at the same time I feel like I have such potential to be more than I am. And right there is where it happened again, at the end of that last sentence. I just broke and stared at my screen for 5 minutes, unable to think. I've been broken my whole life, I've had some pretty bad stuff happen to me from a young age and I guess I didn't realise it broke me until I got older, but looking back it's always been there. Typing this is the most difficult thing I've ever done because my mind has thousands of different things to say and ways to say it and I can't think because of the sheer amount of thoughts I have. I'm scared of piecing myself together because I have no clue who I really am as a whole person. I'm going to let myself ramble here so apologies for anyone who takes their time to read this, I need it to be as authentic as I can. I've done horrible things and Enjoyed them, I've done beautiful things and enjoyed them too, just as I've hated the beautiful things and hated the horrible things. All I know is something feels off. I don't feel right doing both and it's torture. I've put off trying to piece myself together for so long because I'm scared that when I find out who I am, it's going to hurt me, or it will hurt other people. Some days I'm the sanest person you'll ever meet, capable of thinking in really brilliant ways (never intelligent, I'm not an intelligent person) and other days I'm literally insane. That's not an exaggeration or some sort of label I put on myself to make me feel different because of it being ""trendy"" or ""cool"", I have breaks from reality and delusions and I feel I'm capable of the worst acts imaginable. It scares and thrills me at the same time. I have such brilliant ideas in this head, I know I do, but I can't reach them unless I'm whole. I don't know what I'll be if I become  whole or what the ideas are but I can't stand this torture anymore. I need to be me and I need to find out how to be who I feel like I'm supposed to be. I just don't know how. I've seen psychiatrists but none of them scratch the surface or help in any way so I turn to the Internet for advice because maybe there's someone out there who gets me more than some shrink in a tiny office that smells of cheap leather sofas. So my main questions after typing this probably nonsensical thing Is this. Should I try to piece myself together, knowing what I could become if it goes right/wrong? If so, how do I start piecing my shattered soul together ? And if not, what should I do instead? Because I can't suffer much longer. I'd appreciate help in any form and this is as good as I could type it without seeming mad or like an asshole. If you need any more details just ask and I'll try my best to answer them. ",08Mar2019,1
140,"so ive been needing to go to therapy for years, ever since i was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis/crohns. i finally took the leap and decided to take advantage of the free counseling available at my university. i heard mixed reviews about it, but my best friend has been going there for a few weeks and reported good results. since it's free, i figured i would at least give it a shot.

during my session, i poured my heart about two things that were bothering me a lot. one of them was a troubling familial relationship, and the other is a series of events from which i am experiencing some PTSD over. it's important to note that before this counseling session, i had to fill out a general questionnaire about various things such as how often i drink or do drugs, how often i feel this way or that, etc etc.

instead of addressing what i had actually come to counseling for, the guy i was seeing decided to hone in on my drinking, since i reported that while i dont do drugs, i do drink. he asked how often. i told him i drink 0-2 times a week, and usually its 0 or 1 times. he asked how much. i told him that if i was staying in, i would only have 1 or 2 glasses of wine. if i go out to the bar with my friends, ill have 3 or 4 glasses. he asked if my drinking has ever lead to me doing things i regret. i said no.

at the end of the session, he summarized my traumas (i.e. the things im ACTUALLY affected by) but chose to focus on my drinking. he told me that me drinking 3-4 glasses of wine is a ""major red flag"" because i have a grandfather who was an alcoholic (never knew him--my parents kept me far away), and is also a red flag because im a small framed woman. he then told me hes ""surprised"" that i drink ""like that"" because i have colitis, and that most patients he works with who has colitis dont drink because it puts them into a flare. i told him that i dont have an issue with that with the amount i drink, and he gave me a very judgemental look like he didn't believe me. he went on to pretend to be an expert about my illness when all i wanted to do was scream at him that everyone with IBD is very different. some can drink fine, others not so much. i know for a fact that i can drink the amount that i do with no repurcussions.

i left this therapy session VERY upset. i do not have a drinking problem and am bothered he thinks so. am i wrong for feeling this way or do you guys think he had a right to say that? i thought it felt so out of line.

EDIT: i feel like i should add that after this session, i googled the guy i saw. he has a masters in social work and is a licensed clinical social worker, so hes not even a real therapist ",08Mar2019,1

150,"SETTING THE STAGE: I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl trying to live in LA and make music, I have little no work experience, I currently pay for my expenses with $400 from my dad for rent and buy groceries with my CalFresh EBT card. About a month ago I was doing well. I was cutting things close, but I was in school full time, cooking healthy food for myself, exercising, and working towards my goals. I‚Äôd even found a therapist I thought might work for me. As far as finances, I was filling in the blanks at first, with savings (now completely exhausted) and then with FAFSA grant money when I was in school full time. Just a day or so ago I packed up my apartment and moved out and dropped all my classes. I still need to live somewhere and I‚Äôm going to have to give back my Financial Aid money. What happened? My best friend/life partner/fianc√©/soulmate died this week. My entire reality just shattered without warning. I was ripped from everything I knew and believed in and suddenly I‚Äôm in this timeline where I‚Äôm here and she‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know what to live for. I have no plan.

THE ISSUE AT HAND: I obviously need to live somewhere. I‚Äôm not just gonna cease to exist and I need to sleep somewhere. I also need to eat and clean myself and work. All I have right now is that $400 from my dad (which he can‚Äôt actually afford to give me and I feel terrible. My classes are dropped and I can‚Äôt go back because I can‚Äôt be in the city we moved to together to pursue our dreams. I‚Äôs impossible, it just hurts too much. In a dream world I would have my own apartment in a city full of life, I would have a cat and a motorcycle, I would spend my time taking care of myself and my cat and my houseplants and making music and poetry and going to therapy and getting better and working at a job I cared about, volunteering in my community, and putting myself out there socially and as an artist performing at open mics and the like. In this dream my expenses would be paid. My rent and utilities would be paid. I would have money for gas and a small food budget, close to my $200 CalFresh EBT money, which was perfectly fine for me. Clearly, I don‚Äôt live in a magic fairytale world where I get to do part time administrative assistance for an amazing non profit organization and have it cover an apartment in the city and gas and cat food and supplies and groceries and utilities and car/motorcycle insurance and everything else; all while going through recovery and investing in myself as an artist. I wish, but it‚Äôs just not the reality. I don‚Äôt have a trust fund. Which for the first time ever I‚Äôm pretty sad about. \[side note: fuck off if you don‚Äôt like my horrible writing, sentence structure isn‚Äôt at the top of my priorities right now\].

WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?: What of that fairytale world could be made possible though? I‚Äôm young and it‚Äôs very important for me that I‚Äôm enjoying life (I don‚Äôt mean partying I mean fulfillment and wonder). So lets start at the top with housing. I‚Äôve considered alternative options like living out of a garage. It‚Äôs still a possibility but it seems really difficult and not ideal. I‚Äôve lived out of cars and boats and tents and bars and warehouse and lots of other weird places in my short life so I have a bit of experience, I‚Äôm not just being choosy. Ideally I would have my own place. It would be very challenging but I want to focus on how to make this a real possibility. Number one: money. I don‚Äôt have a trust fund, my parents can‚Äôt help me more than they already are ($400/month, which is a huge help), I no longer have FAFSA money since I dropped my classes.. So obviously I need a job. I have a a fair bit of administrative assistant experience, I feel like it‚Äôs not official though because it was for my families business and I was doing it when I was under 18, however the work was real and I have honest skills in management and secretary like areas. I can actually do shit. I am young though so I‚Äôm not sure if I would be respected or seen as valuable? A great resume and linked in page would help here and my parents are both professionals who could help on that front. Say I was able to work full time for $15/hr doing admin assistant work thats $2400 a month, assuming rent was $1500 I‚Äôd have $900 left for utilities food gas healthcare and other costs. Which is very realistic. However, I need to be able to fit inn other things than making money. The two things I most care about are music and recovery/living fully/enjoying life. Additionally, I wanted to get a degree in music or at least take lots of applied and theory music classes. Four classes was awesome! But it was full time and I couldn‚Äôt work full time AND go to school full time. Additionally I would actually get less financial aid support because of my income, I might not get CalFresh EBT either which is like‚Ä¶. Counterintuitive somehow :/ Ok but lets say I have this full time admin assistant job im working 40hrs/week I‚Äôm making $2400 a month I have my own apartment. I have a cat and a motorcycle and gas is cheaper w the motorcycle. I also bike, walk, and take public transit as much as possible. I‚Äôm going out on the evenings when I can, performing at open mics, spending my evenings doing that or staying in and writing (music). I somehow fit in an intensive DBT outpatient program. I go to yoga classes on the weekends or early in the am or something. That so so so so so so so so so fucking hard to sustain, to not burnout. And I find myself back at square one suicidal and feeling like it‚Äôs not worth it to get out of bed because it‚Äôs too hard to sustain having my own space. What the fuck do I do? This feels impossible.

TL;DR I need help figuring out what to do, I‚Äôm starting my whole life over and I have nothing. I‚Äôm 19 and struggling w mental illness and big big trauma and trying to pursue music and live in LA.",08Mar2019,2
151,"It was written after a month and a half of ruminating in isolation, so you can just imagine what kind of nonsense was included. The specifics aren't important, just that there was some kind of mistaken impression when last I saw them, and I tried to clarify when no one really cared. I thought we were close when it turned out we were anything but, so the casual and vulnerable tone of my letter I'm sure was not well-received. They'd all forgotten about me, and all I showed was how much I haven't moved on. Needless to say, they did not reply. 

These people were everything to me. The thoughts simply won't stop, and I think if this goes on any longer I'm going to lose my mind if it hasn't happened already. I should probably get out of the house, but all I really want to do is curl up in a ball somewhere and shut out the world. I've never felt more worthless or misunderstood.

Any advice?",08Mar2019,1
152,"I stayed in a psychiatric hospital in Missouri because I was extremely suicidal. I‚Äôm not quite back to that place, but I‚Äôm in bad shape with my PTSD right now and really need help. I want to go back, I actually liked the hospital that I was in, but I didn‚Äôt like that I had to share a room with somebody. Due to my PTSD, trusting a roommate was a huge issue for me. I couldn‚Äôt handle it very well and was trying to get out every day. I don‚Äôt have any money, I don‚Äôt have insurance, but I need to find somewhere to go, preferably without shared rooms. I need my own space to heal. If I can‚Äôt have that, I‚Äôm likely better off just taking my pills on time 3x a day and locking myself in my walk-in closet with the light turned off.

153,"I‚Äôve been on reddit for a while and had no idea this sub existed, but now that I‚Äôve discovered the stories shared here and the bravery, I‚Äôm so thankful. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and anorexia and I‚Äôm currently in what I feel is as close to rock bottom as I‚Äôve ever been. Two nights ago, I got rip-roaring drunk, which I‚Äôve been doing a lot lately because of my seasonal affective disorder. I ended up being sexually assaulted by a person I‚Äôve known for years. I ran out of there, left my coat behind (mind you it‚Äôs currently -10 degrees Celsius) and went home and passed out. When I woke up yesterday morning, I was about to kill myself. I still was in my clothes from the night before, my hair was unbrushed, my makeup was in a smudgy disarray from crying, and in that moment I stopped myself, left my phone and anything else at home, grabbed just my wallet so I could pay for a cab, and I took a cab to a mental health clinic. They saved my life. They made me call my parents, took me to the hospital, and now I‚Äôm back with my parents trying to recover from this week. In this moment I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to say to the man I‚Äôve been dating for the past few weeks because I can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to date anyone right now and to be honest sex has been tarnished for me now and I need to be alone.

She didn‚Äôt think I had all 9 criteria of BPD, but she definitely agreed with at least 5, which is enough for a diagnosis. I personally feel that I meet 7 of the criteria but she is dismissing them because even though I am an adult, I‚Äôm still relatively young. She told me she didn‚Äôt want to diagnose me because she wants me to reverse it before it gets worse. Why won‚Äôt she just give me the diagnosis? I‚Äôve spent the last several years wondering if I‚Äôm delusional and this definitely isn‚Äôt helping. I asked if and when she would tell me an official diagnosis and she said if someone put a gun to her head and she had to say yes or no, she‚Äôd say I have it, but isn‚Äôt that kinda extreme? I‚Äôm so upset, I cried the whole drive home and someone blared their horn at me because I wasn‚Äôt focused on my driving. Am I just a terrible person then? I‚Äôm just really distraught because I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm an idiot or if she doesn‚Äôt know enough about me yet.

155,"I'm struggling. And I hate that I'm struggling. My social anxiety has been so ridiculously insane this past year. I feel it has been this way because I have been forced to go out into social situations due to my career (where normally I wouldn't be in those situations). It has reached the point where my face goes so red every time I have to speak with some, and I become stiff. I have a hard time initiating conversations, I get so into my head and nervous that it becomes too late to initiate. Whenever I have a meeting or an interview I'm SO nervous for days prior. And I feel like people notice my anxious energy. As a child, I was a pretty huge gamer (and still am frankly) and spent my days at home. That might explain why I'm like this.

156,"Hey everyone! I messaged the mods in a request to post this (because I just wasn't sure if I was able to); however, I'm not sure how quickly they may see the message. The reason I was a bit concerned is because I get an automatic ""tag"" when someone uses the words ""security clearance."" For some reason I have gotten several in the past couple of days for this sub requesting help regarding US security clearances. Each time, except for one, has been quickly deleted before I could reply. So I wanted to add this information if I may.

**Will mental health impact my security clearance or a chance to get one?**

The short answer is typically no, despite common belief. It's exceptionally rare for clearances to be denied/revoked/suspended over mental health.

The longer answer with sources:

Do note, however, if you fail to seek proper treatment then yes you could have a negative outcome. This includes stopping treatment against doctors orders, not taking the proper medication or not seeking help when needed. 

Some additional input down at the bottom of this post.

**If you need help, then please seek it.** Do **not** continue this stigma or allow it to continue. I am begging you.

&gt; The knee-jerk reaction that mental health issues cause automatic clearance denial is not true. Between 2006 and 2016 only one in 35,000 were denied or lost a security clearance due to mental illness.

- Between 2006 and 2012, only one in every 35,000 people either applying for the first time or seeking to maintain their clearance were either denied a clearance or had their clearance revoked after answering ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the dreaded Question 21 on Standard Form 86 (the question that pertains to mental health history).

- Further, during that same 6-year time period, of the 85,000 people who were either denied a clearance or had their clearance revoked, only 145 ‚Äì 0.17 percent ‚Äì of denials and revocations were due to mental health reasons. That is significantly less than 1 percent.

[Mental health counseling and treatment in and of itself is NOT a reason to deny or revoke your security clearance.

I hear you, yes I can link things all day long but you're probably like ""well so and so lost theirs!"" Or ""I know someone with depression that didn't get it!"" Or ""I got terminated for it!"" Or ""my command terminated me!"" ...

But there are a couple of things to keep in mind. For example, Fitness for Duty requirements. Your position may require increased scrutiny *on internal policies* regarding your mental health. This does **not** mean it's part of the clearance process. So for example, if you are removed from a position based on FoD, then it's possible that your ""need to know"" is removed also. Clearances have to be terminated when you no longer have the need to know. This should **not** be conflated with the clearance processes. 

Further, those ""people"" you hear about have these possibilities going on:

- They are lying about why they were denied/revoked
- The denial was compounded by something else
- They didn't seek proper treatment or they didn't maintain treatment
- They had a severe mental health issue (again, exceptionally rare) that couldn't be mitigated properly.
- They are just spreading the stigma from the above

**If you need help, then please seek it.**

If you're afraid, I will help navigate things with you. There are many others who will do the same. 

**Never** lie or try to omit things with your clearance. It **can** be uncovered and will make things worse for you.

I am pleading with anyone who reads this, please do not allow this stigma to continue any longer if you see it out in the ""wild.""

I am really passionate about this for more reasons than one.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 16, I've had really bad social anxiety for years and I really struggle to talk to people. I haven't really had friends or even a meaningful conversation in a long time. I've been trying to push myself to talk to people a little because I don't want to be lonely but I can't bring myself to carry a conversation with more than a few words. There's a girl I just met in my class this week and she's really nice and tries to talk to me, she likes a lot of the same things I do but I can still barely talk to her because I'm too anxious to handle myself or say a lot. She probably thinks I'm being rude to her by not talking to her but I don't intend to come off that way at all. I keep thinking about her. I really want to be able to have friends and talk to them openly but I struggle to. Right now I'm out of school for spring break with 0 plans or friends to talk to and I have a shitty relationship with my parent. I keep thinking about what I *would* say to people if I was able to and it's driving me crazy. I don't want to live like this anymore, I don't want to spend every day sitting in my house and dreaming of happiness like I have for years, just playing video games and watching Netflix to distract my mind, I feel worthless.",08Mar2019,10
