0,"So little bit of back story, I recently ran away took a train to London (far away from where I currently live) and then took an overdose. I was found by the police quite a while later and was detained. I was taken to the police station where upon arrival they realised that I definitely did take those pills... (I told them I didn’t and that I just dumped them I was going to run but I like couldn’t really even walk) so the paramedics came and withpolice escorts transported me to central London. Where I was admitted and treated. 

My bloods now fine (I think) but I have to stay for evaluations and I have been sectioned by the police. I liked that officer before he did that to me. So I’m hours away from home. Stuck in hell with a one to one watching me at all times. Well they are supposed to but mine literally just walked away from me because he thought I was asleep but like my eyes were open? I don’t know. They’re idiots. 

Any way, I like need to get out. I want to get help for my family and everyone else that loves me but I don’t know if I can. If they just keep leaving me like that it might be easier than I think I just need to see if the doors are locked on the inside as well. I could probs just kill myself here on the ward anyway. There no where near as secure as the actual psychiatric hospitals I’ve been to. It would be too easy. But then again I would probably still get caught and my next time I’m not going to be. 

They’re probably going to send me back to the psych hospital and I told my brother I would go willingly but. I don’t know if I can. What if they don’t put me on that section and I can just leave? I don’t know if I want to risk it. I know what they usually do is ask if I would like to go and if I say no then they will section me but I don’t know. I just have to do this you know?",20Mar2019,3
1,"So I’ve felt depressed/anxious pretty much as long as I can remember but it’s been getting worse as of late. All of this ironic cuz my life is pretty good: got a nice car, stressful yet rewarding job, got out of a toxic living situation and have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years. My problem is that I feel like I need help but also feel that I’m not bad off enough to need it. I wanna try to “fix” me and try medication but I don’t wanna have to go to a therapist. Also I can’t afford to go a therapist. Any advice?",20Mar2019,1

3,"I have 8 days until I start working 40 hours a week. Perhaps I'm a brat but the entire concept of selling my self determination to survive is an existential horror. Between working, sleeping and the necessary tasks of life ( eating, exercising, commuting) I get like 2 hours a day to do the "" work"" of being myself. I want to work, but having a job is philosophically difficult. I am not there for 9 hours a day because I want to be. Even though the work is satisfying and rewarding, I am still doing it because I must not because I choose to.

I am trying to lean into the existential crisis to get it over with so I can have some peace and find some happiness in the few hours wherein I do actually own myself. I am actively trying to make myself more miserable hoping that I will bounce back. I dont know if that's good or not but I sure hope it works because if it doesnt, I dont know what I'm going to do.

4,"I often feel like I'm either really happy or really depressed. When I'm happy I have lots of energy and I feel like I dont need as much sleep, it also feels like my mind is racing and 100km per minute thinking about all sorts of ideas and daydreams. When I'm depressed and down I dont have much energy or motivation, I'm quick to lash out and take frustration out on others, and I tend to wake up really late and go to bed late. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I cant tell whether this is just depressive episodes or whether it is BPD. Also, if someone could inform me of the difference between depression and BP that would be helpful because they sound alike.",20Mar2019,1
5,"My mental health has been on a decline for years now but recently it has been rapidly getting worse. I’ll have moments of clarity every now and then but over all I get super one track minded, and have to deal with intense OCD and anxiety. Depression and existentialism on top of that. Recently I’ve been constantly worrying and getting panic attacks over things that brought me absolutely zero anxiety just two years ago. Things that really aren’t that bad. I fear that if this pattern doesn’t change, in a decade or two I’ll be dead. And by that point it would probably be better that way for my own sake. I’m just hoping I don’t end up like that. I’ve been suicidal many times in the past, more so recently, and I know how much it sucks. I don’t want to die but I know I can’t keep living like this. Therapy hasn’t been working, I think some of my fears and thought problems are too absurd and no therapist I’ve gone to so far knows what to do with that information. I’m hoping medication can hold me over until I finally find someone that can understand. ————————————————————————————————————————————————————My theory is that I may be repressing or trying to repress something and my fears are just smaller “contained” versions of whatever is actually bothering me. It might not even be something that has happened but something I’m afraid of happening that I don’t want to acknowledge. Maybe it’s a weird theory to have but it would have possibly made sense to you if you knew my typical thought process. I often try to forget and repress random things that happen on the daily. It’s probably my go to coping mechanism but if it has worked in the past I wouldn’t remember. Anyway I think that’s enough rambling.",20Mar2019,2
6,"Or is that just me never accepting and loving myself? 

I feel that I have not been at ease and at comfort for a long time. Even among friends and family, I think I still search for a fallacious sense of home elsewhere. I don’t know where along the way I conceived the concept maybe from a movie, a memory, I don’t know. But I am constantly looking for something to come captivate my attention and give me this sense of happiness, whether it be an exciting event, a sprawling city, a group of loved ones that I am not currently with. Does this make sense? For example, a few years back I really believed that moving to a new dazzling city would help my issues. The hustle and bustle would distract me. The lifestyle would improve me. I would be living the life I wanted to live, but ultimately I realized, I was the same person in a different place.

Or when I was younger, I would get very sad on certain nights at home even If i was with my family and I would beg them to go out to eat at a restaurant. I craved the atmosphere and to be surrounded by various stimuli(the presence of other people, lights, sounds, etc)

7,"Not sure if this is allowed or not. Apologizes if I broke a rule.

I'm a 22 year old guy about to graduate college. I have trouble recalling long term memories but nothing else of note. 

I was in a class waiting for class to start. I took out my notebook and a pen. I went to write the lecture number at the top of a page. My pen didn't want to write. I tried scribbling with the pen for a bit and then I tried shaking the pen. Nothing worked and I just had pressure lines on my paper with no ink. I turned around to see if someone had a pen for me to borrow when the professor walks in. I look at the notebook and it has a lot of scribbles in ink now and my pen worked.

This all happened in about a minute and there was no one who could have written in my notebook without me noticing. Plus my pen did work after I turned around somehow. It is so strange because I looked at the notebook with only pressure lines and that IS how I saw it. I looked at the notebook for a good 30 seconds and there was no ink. This wasn't a simple case of me not seeing something or being rushed.

What does this sound like?",20Mar2019,2
8,"My Uncle recently contracted a nasty cough from my dad. He hasn't slept for the past three days due to the bad coughing, so he came over last night to sleep at our place. I've recently been sleeping downstairs on the couches with my mom, so I offered him to sleep on the bed in my room. 

Today, I received this series of text messages from him; [https://imgur.com/OMzmn7B](https://imgur.com/OMzmn7B)

The texts left my family and I disturbed. What was he trying to say? What does he mean? 

&amp;#x200B;

Some backstory: We live in Toronto, Canada. My uncle is 62 years old and we believe he has minor schizophrenia. He was never officially diagnosed but he talks out loud to himself frequently and claimed to hear voices. Sometimes, my family and I find his judgements off-key(?) or non-sensical. He assumes about things and just has this distorted perception of reality and the way things work. For example, I used to work at a grocery store pharmacy that my Uncle frequently shopped at. I was fired from my job, and about a month later my Uncle said to me that he overheard the workers saying, ""it's awful what *they* did to that woman"" and then continued to say how Food Basics workers thought I was a hero when very easily the workers could have been talking about ANYTHING.

To add on, I've noticed that my Uncle becomes more stressed out when he doesn't sleep. Years ago, he temporarily lost his mind. He showed up to our house late at night and he said he couldn't remember where he was going and what he was supposed to be doing. The doctor said he was under immense mental stress which caused the episode. My dad believes that my Uncle is currently undergoing mental stress once more which led him to send those series of texts to me. 

Other than that, my Uncle is a very kind and compassionate man who prioritizes family. He doesn't have any family; only my mom, my dad and I. I used to be very close to him when I was younger but over years I've distanced myself because of some of the strange things he would say. He's very lonely and used to come over once a week to hang out with us at our house. It wasn't until September of last year when he started to come over daily. Last month, he started to stay longer -- often arriving in the afternoon and leaving at 8 at night. 

Other than the texts, he hasn't said anything unusual. The only 'unusual' thing we have noticed about him are his more frequent visits to our house. 

He has hypertension (which he takes meds for) and diabetes. He only takes prescription drugs and doesn't drink. He works part time as a security guard which requires long night shifts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I truly wish to help my uncle. We think my Uncle really wants connection and someone to talk to but he has interpersonal issues. We've haven't done anything to help him all these years but I want to change that. I was thinking he could see a therapist but I just don't know how to help him. Advice on the options available and how to handle the situation is appreciated.

9,"I don’t know where to start with my problems. I turn 24 next month and I fear I won’t make it past the eve of my birthday. This year marks 10 years to when my problems began, should I take that as a sign?

I’m not sure how to explain the jumble in my head, it’s as if I’m re-living every bad choice or decision I’ve ever made and have given up on all hope for the future. 

I guess a rewind could be helpful, I’m not going to get any sleep tonight! 

When I was around 14 I didn’t have many friends, I was a fairly chubby gay kid at school which made me prime for bullying. My parents were never around and looking back I never had anyone there for me... that’s when I found the joys of gay chat sites. I’d openly talk to much older men, they’d know my age and at the time I saw nothing wrong. I sent the odd picture now and then and let them talk to me in such explicit language, who knew only last week I found one of them on a dating app in the same city as me. He was particularly horrible, a face I can’t un see and a fear of any sexual relationship in my adult life. Being full of rage I’ve successfully got evidence to what he wanted to do to me, but now I have it I’m not sure what to do... As much as I want to go forward to the police I wonder what good it will do? He’s only 1 of at least 100 I spoke to. I feel utterly ashamed and disgusted at myself. Equally as I never did anything with them physically I tell myself it could have been worse...

After watching a British soap opera at the age of 14 I discovered the wonderful life of anorexia. No longer the chubby kid at school (although staid the same gay kid) I found a way to suppress all my feelings (even now) by starving or binging on food. It took 6 years for my parents to realise, and even then after 3 short therapy sessions I was assumed to be OK - whatever that is. 

Failing most my exams at school I was happy to leave and enter the working world. I’d say at the age of 19-21 I was doing fine. Solid friends, easy work, parents still nowhere to be seen in terms of support. Fine. 

The last 2 years I felt I’ve given up. No chance in romance after being petrified to go any further sexually with a man than the basics, eating is up and down, social life is dwindling, sleep is gone, happiness is put on with a fake smile, I just want to stop. Have a break in time and reflect on everything I’ve done.

I had a full breakdown last summer, angry outbursts at family events and admitting I nearly threw myself off a bridge. Yet my parents only see what they want to, and I’m getting worse by the minute. I drink so much I hope I’ll kill my self and stage it like an accident sometimes. 

But now I think death is the only way out. Something quick and guaranteed. I’m not sure what else I can do to be happy... ",20Mar2019,1
10,"Every cool moment that happens, every funny thing I say, every cool outfit I wear, I feel like I have to post about it somewhere or else it’s completely pointless. Maybe it’s because I don’t have any friends or because I feel like I’m counteracting old childhood photos of myself that were made public that I absolutely hated. Or both. I think maybe it’s more just the fact that some of my worst photos exist publicly in the world (even if nobody cares that they exist) meanwhile my best moments in life go completely undocumented. Could this possibly be a result of me having OCD and social anxiety? Because my heart won’t stop pounding as I continue to panic over this.",20Mar2019,6

I was sent to to ER as a suicidal patient and now am going to have to start therapy. I wanted this so bad I wanted how I felt to be recognized but I thought... I thought I’d learn something. But I’m back to before.... I’m still stuck and I can’t get out of this thing. I’m so just lost? My mood is changing intensely. From very angry to sad. As a pretty happy person it’s so odd to feel this way for a long time. (3 months) but it keeps getting worse. I’m in physical pain and I can’t ignore the feelings. They are so powerful and I want them all to end a-and it hurts so bad. I hate it. I’m getting so stressed at this point because the world keeps chucking me down. Everything I’m going through is getting tossed into a pit where the dirt keeps getting filled in to fix the hole. But with each scoop is about few problems. It’s suffocating me. I’ve reached out for help I was even in the hospital and got help but it still hasn’t gone away. I want to hurt myself but I can’t because I get checked on. I want to just slit myself open.

12,"10 years marks the time where all my problems seemed to have started. Maybe I should take this as a sign?

Last summer I had my first breakdown. An angry outburst at a family BBQ left me realising I really am alone. Confining in a family member they said the words which sum my life up ‘you’ve always been alone’. It’s staid with me. And now I feel I should do the one thing we all can’t escape from, and yet all have in common. 

No one goes forward alone.

I was groomed online as a child
I have an eating disorder 
I have depression 
I have anxiety 
I hate myself 
I can’t sleep
I can’t leave my house
I miss work
I want to be alone
I want to jump 

I never thought my adult life would be like this. I’m so sad and scared. Scared of everything that normal life is about.

Is it ok I take time off work so much these days for mental health?
What good is it doing taking time off when I just keep getting worse?
Why aren’t I happy?
Why is jumping so bad?

13,"Hi everyone, I'm a 22-year-old female in Northern California in the United States. Something really weird is going on and I'm not quite sure what I can do about it. I mostly want to vent I guess, but I'd appreciate any advice.

This all started about three weeks ago when I started having extremely bad night terrors. Whenever I closed looked at the corners of my bedroom or into the mirror at night, I would see shadowy figures moving. Occasionally they would just be shadows, some of the figures were all black with glowing white eyes and teeth, some were black with flecks of red, similar to embers in a campfire. I could move and speak, so it didn't feel like sleep paralysis.

I started to hear things too, loud cracks of wood against wood, doors slamming, whispers coming from nowhere, I would hear my alarm when it wasn't going off, I would hear a low pulsing noise like some sort of other alarm, worst of all was the screams I started to hear in the distance. My girlfriend couldn't see or hear any of these things and confirmed they weren't real.

I started laughing involuntarily, almost uncontrollably, getting pain in the top of head randomly, and I'd start to get really weak. Consistently getting tired, lightheaded, nauseous, and dizzy every time I would go out to the store for fifteen minutes or stand in the shower for twenty. I couldn't go to work because of how much of my job requires moving around. Luckily I'm self-employed, so I won't get fired for missing three weeks of work.

I went to go see a doctor and a psychologist. The doctor appointment was largely uneventful, but the psychologist appointment was interesting to say the least. It felt like she was trying to get me in and out of her office as quickly as possible. She ignored a lot of my issues (the laughing and weakness specifically), and seemed all too quick to give me an antipsychotic. She also seemed to imply that the fact I'm a lesbian might have something to do with it. She asked me a lot of questions pertaining to my sexuality. (I had told her I came to the appointment with my girlfriend, so it didn't come out of nowhere.)

Anyway, since then I was prescribed a low (50 mg) dose of Seroquel, which she said would help me sleep and feel less anxious. She said I don't need a larger dose because I've stayed in touch with reality. I, for the most part, recognize what is and isn't a hallucination.

The meds have only made things worse, I'm constantly tired, more exhausted than I've ever been. It's extremely hard for me to communicate ideas, it takes me longer to think and even longer to speak. I feel like my mind and personality has dulled. The hallucinations have slowed down, but that's more because we got a night light. I still hear things at night, mostly screams, whispers and banging, and I see things in the corner of my eyes.

I'm getting paranoid and my girlfriend says that I'm looking disheveled and frantic the past couple days. I've been convinced that my girlfriend is just trying to find a way to break up with me because I'm such a burden, I'm thinking that our other roommate is plotting ways to get me kicked out or laughing at me behind my back, I'm convinced that the doctor is misdiagnosing me intentionally. I'm also starting to feel that the pills are making my life and condition worse, and I need to stop taking them.

I don't understand what's going on. The worst part is, I still haven't lost touch with reality, I know what's going on. I know that my paranoid thoughts aren't true, I know that the hallucinations aren't real, I know that the doctor is just doing her job, my rational brain knows all of this, but it feels like I'm in a constant fight with my irrational brain.

And then we have the imposter syndrome. I'm constantly wondering if I'm just doing this for attention and I'm fine. That I've convinced myself I'm insane for attention, or time off work, or something like that and if I really, really pushed myself, and I stopped taking the meds that make me so tired, I would be a normal person.

I have an appointment with the psychologist again tomorrow, but I really, really don't want to go. An instinct in my gut is begging me to not.

I don't really know the point of this. I'm scared and I don't know what's happening. If anyone has anything to say or relates/did relate at one point, I appreciate any comments.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this kind of post.",20Mar2019,3
14,"this is going to sound crazy, but ever since I was a little girl I was groomed to be more like a boy by my parents. Its going to sound weird but as I gravitated towards feminine activities, they would block me from doing them. I was never allowed to do feminine sports like dance or figure skating which I asked the repeatedly to do and they said no. But when it came to either neutral or masculine sports like swimming and skateboarding they let me. My dad actually went to the skateboard shop with me to pick one out and get hardware tools to build it. I was never allowed to wear makeup, This actually caused violent fights throughout my teens because I wanted to wear makeup so badly and my mom would scream at me and come in my room when I wasnt there and smash all my makeup. I wasnt allowed to ever talk to boys even as a 18 year old so I was never allowed to date or have a boyfriend. And I even noticed over time that as I talked to me parents in a more feminine sweet tone, my dad was more likely to make fun of me or fight with me. And if I talked in a more serious, direct, abrasive, and even slightly more manly voice, he would treat me with respect and nicely. Over years all this actually eventually affected me subconsciously and I just gave in and started being more tom boyish. And now I just feel like I am a tom boy even at 28 and give off more masculine energy than feminine. I wish i didnt get my natural desire to be feminine crushed out of me by my parents.

18,"I know that it’s not good to post this here, but... fuck, if I’m being honest, I have nowhere else to go. 

So, a little backstory to my problem. I’m young. I won’t say exactly how old, but I’m in high school, which gives you a decent idea. I’ve struggled with depression since sixth grade and possibly sooner, since I attempted suicide when I was four. But I can’t pinpoint exactly when the thoughts started, so I just say sixth grade. When I was in eighth grade, the person who was essentially my idol at the time managed to convince me to call suicide hotline. I did, and obliged when they asked if they could send someone to check on me. From there, I got a therapist, and was starting to feel a bit better. But... she was only temporary. She left, and it wouldn’t be for another year until I got a replacement. My next therapist, he was, well, he was fine. He tried to help me, but soon it became clear that I was out of his control. When I developed an eating disorder is when he said he would no longer be able to care for me. Then I got the therapist I have now. It’s been a year since then. My current therapist is fine. She’s fine. Not good, or bad, just whatever. I’ve barely managed to scrape by these past few years, and just this year I’ve already called suicide hotline more times than I can count. I feel so useless now. I’ve been tossed from therapist to therapist so many times and only one has been helpful. And now I’ll never get her back. This year I even developed this problem where I have no compulsion to respond to texts. I used to. Now I don’t. So I have no friends. I don’t talk to anyone. Don’t hang out with anyone. The only person who keeps me sane is my girlfriend. I love her, but I know I’m letting her down. She can do so much better than me. Everyone can do better than me.

So now I’m here. On reddit. A sort of last resort, if you will. I feel no desire to live anymore. I don’t see why I still am. 

The only thing that scares me now is my family. I wouldn’t want to hurt them like that. But... I’m going to die anyway. We all will, so nothing really matters. Some people will use that as an excuse to party or drink, some will use it to live their best life. Me? I have no life. I’m not happy. So there’s no reason for me to live anymore. I know people also say, “but what about the things you want to do in your future???” And yeah? What about them. I don’t care anymore. What’s the point in living just for the false hope of some fleeting happy moment that will only ever grant me temporary satisfaction? What’s the point in that? Why am I even doing this anymore?

And I guess... I don’t have the answer to any of that. So... that’s why I’m here. If anyone has any insight to this, I’d love to hear it. Otherwise I don’t think I can do this anymore. I’ve already called suicide hotline so many times. Suffered through so many therapists. Ruined all my relationships. Trashed my self-worth.

22,"I am a nurse, currently working and studying. Where I live, many nurses do postgraduate studies to then apply for senior nursing roles. I applied for funding last year before I changed area of specialty and got into my course. I also stopped taking my anti-depressants right before I changed jobs as I was in a better headspace. Little did I know I find this new job extremely stressful. 

Due to work stress, study stress, and other life stressors (buying a house, the recent mosque terrorist attack is where I live, generally anxious and have low moods periodically etc) my mental health went downhill. I spent a lot of time crying and laying in bed so I went back to the doctors and am now back on my medications. The way I am living now is not sustainable.

I need to keep working to save for my house. I feel that without study, I can handle my job a lot better so the best option would be to put my studies on hold until I recover. However by quitting my studies I feel guilty as I have received funding for it. I also signed up to study with one of my best friends and we were going to do it together. Lastly, to make this all worse, my new manager wanted to make sure that I would be able to handle study before I started and at the time I agreed that I would be able to handle it but circumstances have changed.

I had to convince the doctor that the sertraline doesn't work for me. He kept pushing it saying that it is a great medicine. I know it is a great medication that works for a lot of people but for me it did nothing. I now have to go 5 days before I can start taking the escitalopram. I can't sleep, I can't eat and I'm just sick of feeling awful all the time. 

The first doctor I talked to recommended me for counselling and I am now on a waiting list through my school. I just don't feel like there is anyone I can talk about some of my concerns with. I'm relatively close with my family but how can I tell them I hate myself? How can I tell them I feel like everything would be better if I wasn't alive? How can I tell my roommate I've known since I was 3 years old that I don't think I would be alive if she wasn't here? 

I'm tired of feeling worthless because I failed a test or because I gained some weight or because I remember my ex doesn't love me. I'm tired of all of this and worst of all I feel guilty for feeling of all of this because ... well I don't know exactly why I feel guilty for how I feel... I guess it all seems pretty small compared to other people's problems. I guess it also doesn't feel fair to put this on my loved ones or to worry them??  I've always wanted to be the person others could lean on when they needed support  but I just don't feel like I can do it anymore.  

I just don't feel like myself anymore. I feel lost and completely confused. I just don't know when I will feel okay again. Sorry for the long post and thank you for letting me vent. ",20Mar2019,1
25,"Hi uhm for a long time I've been feeling really dismissive and I notice I have been making risky decisions without an ounce of thought. Often I've been lashing out on my family and not caring whether I hurt their feelings or not. I've been very unmotivated, uninterested, and careless with how I approach everyday life. Things that could be done in a minute takes me a thousand years to complete successfully. For some reason I will drag myself to work but won't even get out of bed to go to school.

27," Hi y'all,

So I am here because I have been struggling all my life with something that hasn't been clear to me.

In preschool, teachers noticed I did not perform well, and that I was often distracted. When my father came in and sat next to me, I got a lot more done, and even excelled. My doctor diagnosed me with ADHD, and I have been medicated ever since. The problem I have found, is that I do not believe ADHD is my only problem. I am not able to do anything that takes any mental exercise on my own. In school, this meant I would get class work done decently well, take longer on tests, and hardly do homework. I have always been disorganized, and frequently lost and forgot about papers I was supposed to bring home, or I would remember them, and want to do them because I knew it could just take a few minutes, and then find it to be to late, there was another assignment not done. Somehow I got through school like this, my grades being made mostly by tests, in class assignments, projects my parents were present for, and zeros on most of my homework. Later in high school, things got more difficult. More independence, more difficult and tome consuming homework worth more points that I couldn't get myself to do, and this culminated in my nearly failing, or actually failing AP classes, yet still getting 5s on the exams. I always knew what I was doing, just could never do the work for it. Now I am in college, and failing out. I also have a lot more going on now, but I still have the same old problem. This whole time, if I were with someone else, I would get things done. But since most of my time now I have spent alone, or with people who didn't have time to spend on me, I have failed.  
And this isn't just with school work, I have noticed. That's just the part that makes my career path difficult. In my own life of doing things I love, I quite simply just haven't. I enjoy playing video games, or sports, or reading, or programming, or archery, or playing flute. The problem is I don't do any of them on a regular basis, and can't get myself to. I can't even get myself to text much with people I can't see (snapchat saves me here). But if I have someone to do it with, suddenly I can do any of them, and holy heck is it fun. If some friends or my brother start playing a game with me, I will finally play games, even though I don't play them on my own. I joined a soccer team in middle school, and LOVED it, but I could never practice on my own. I hardly read, but when I go to summer camp and don't have my phone, I will eat through books during rest times if I am not tired, and love every second of it and wish it wouldn't end. I love to make programs, but I only ever could get myself to do it during school, whenever I could get away with a little free time, that or I would watch college lectures because I found them so interesting. Never would I do that at home on my own when no one is around. I have been doing archery since I was a small kid, like 8, but I only ever did it when I was at medieval re-enactment events, or nowdays when my friend asks me to do some shooting with him. I love playing flute, and play in a concert band, but I just can't practice it at home. Its like I need to have those 80 or so people and a conductor just so I can live my life.  I don't understand why this is the case, but independence feels impossible to me, yet inevitable, and thus leading only to failure.  

What is going on?? I need help. Sorry that was so long, but I just can’t TL:Dl this. 

Thanks, Celeste",20Mar2019,1
28,"‪it took me 31 years on this planet to realize i need to do a lot more “picking myself up” and self care than i ever thought in order to feel good about myself and my life, and that’s probably why I’ve never felt better even when i do the things that are supposed to help. 

and so I’ve been trying to pay more attention to my emotional needs now that I’m at least more aware of them, but sometimes it’s a lot harder than it sounds.

everyday life gets in the way, and clashes with this self-imposed ticking clock in my brain, counting how much time I’m wasting feeling sorry, thinking negatively, focusing negatively, disrespecting myself, binging, crying, hibernating, avoiding, neglecting, obsessing. 

I can’t control others and i certainly can’t control myself either, so how can i possibly improve my situation or make things better? How do i teach myself the self control and integrity that my parents didn’t? 

most days I’m just lucky to make it through and end up cozy in bed with my husband, who also struggles with mental illness and trauma PTSD, and our dog, falling asleep to the sound of some true crime show on Netflix; our bodies intertwined so tight like it’s the only thing keeping us gripped to the beautiful reality our minds often try to hide from us. 

I am happy, i am grateful, but i am also sad and confused about what to do next. So i just keep trying. I try to trust the process. Another day, another shot at having a good day. And maybe, enough good days will lead to real, positive change and personal revelation. One day, maybe things will just be okay and we will be happy with what we have, each other and ourselves, and I’ll look back at this time as a period of great transformation. 

At least i hope.‬",20Mar2019,1
29,"I was just admitted to general hospital and I’m feeling so paranoid. Well I think that’s what it is. I have to have a nurse/HCA with me at all times and I had a cannula in. That was up until a few moments ago. It’s like almost 3:00am. I’m hallucinating auditory ones and visual ones and I’m really freaking out. The doctors were going to give me things through the cannula whilst I slept so that I wouldn’t know they were doing it. They tried to do it before but in the water. So like last time like when I stopped drinking the water, I pulled the cannula out. I finished all my stuff any way so that’s even more suspicious, why did they keep it in if I didn’t need it? 

The nurse that’s with me tonight didn’t notice though. He’s new I think. I’m glad it’s out. I don’t know what they’re going to do when they find out. Plus I can’t let them get their Honda on it since it has my blood in it and I can’t let them get my DNA. But it’s not like I can just walk over to a bin you know? I’m fucking screwed. I was trying not to get sent back to a psych ward..

I really want to run away right now though. I just don’t know how I can. Plus I was told my section was for 24 hours and once that time was up I asked if I’m technically allowed to leave now and that nurse said that’s not how it works. So I’m confused and paranoid now about the fact that different people are telling me different things. And their trying to keep me here against my will. I just want to die. I need to die. I’m pretty sure if I am legally allowed to leave anyway if I try they will just section me again. 

I feel really sick now. Could it be because I pulled the cannula out or maybe because I’m having a panic attack I don’t know...",20Mar2019,1

40,"I have bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety to preface. I got out of an an emotionally abusive relationship two years ago, and have been with my current partner for about 9 months. He is great, and kind and trustworthy and things have been working out great between us. 

Due to the nature of my past relationship, especially because it was the first time I had experienced a real betrayal, At that time I had lost my ability to trust, at all. I couldn’t trust myself, let alone other people. I even began to doubt my greatest support systems and my therapist. And I have been working though that a lot for the past few years. 

Now cut to my current partner- who I logically know would never lie to me. However I still find myself doubting things he says, or making up scenarios in my head of him being in love with another friend of his. (These feelings are irrational, I logically know they are not based in truth). I constantly convince myself that he is lying. I have also never been “jealous” in past relationships.  

I saw a infographic of what a “healthy relationship” looks like, and of course trust is one of the main components. 

I don’t want to be abusive or unhealthy to him because I have these irrational trust issues. When we talk about them, I always inform him that the thoughts I’m having are not based in truth or based on anything he has done in the relationship, but they are made up in my own head. But still, I don’t want to be having them, and I don’t want him to feel any amount of pain over them. He is the kindest, most understanding person I’ve ever met. 

How do you deal with these feelings? When you know they are caused by insecurity/anxiety etc.

41,"Here's the whole story. It just happened today. I was sleeping when suddenly I hear knocking on my door. I go open the door just to find 2 policeman and my landlord at the door.

Apparently the neighbors notice a foul smell in my room, and since I had not talked with my landlord for a while and was late on a payment, she thought something might have happened to me. 

So anyways, the cops and me talk about the state of the room (which was a mess) and they ask me to clean it out. I'm not panicked at all during this situation and instead I begin seeing it as a way out.

They start asking questions about why my room is in such a mess and about my general life. For the first time, I don't just hold it in and I say that I quit university and that I'm not functionnal right now. The whole situation being ridiculous probably helped. 

So the policeman then referred me to intervenants that they work with, who just happened to be nearby. They come to my place, we talk a while about my symptoms (lack of energy, lack of motivation, thinking that things would be way easier if I was death and general apathy).

They suggested that I schedule a meeting with their psychiatrist, although it could take a month to get one. I then ask them if there is a more short term solution which leads to them saying they could set me up to have someone bring me to ER when I was ready.

After considering everything, and overcoming the anxiety caused by the idea of meeting someone and having to open up, I say that I would actually like to go now. So the two of them decide to take me there. We then make our way towards the hospital, with me still being anxious the whole way.

The two of them then come inside the hospital with and tell the receptionnist what was wrong with me since I was still very anxious. They then sit together with me in the waiting room and wait while reassuring me that everything will be alright.

So we meet with the doctor and talk about a lot of the situation. He then refers me to a psychiatrist, so I head up to the psychiatry unit waiting room. The intervenants leave at this point. It's a bit uncomfortable since a few people there are really looking unwell, or a bit weird. The worst one is probably a teenage who I overheard was raped by his dad. It really broke my heart.

Anyways, after some questioning with some people and others and finally the psychiatrist, the conclusion was that I indeed suffered from depression. 

They then needed blood samples. The problem is that I'm deadly afraid of needles. So the super sweet nurse that is in charge of the blood samples and of taking care of me takes the time to talk with me for a while and we succeed.

So now I have to sleep over at the hospital. I'm left thinking about why I am like this, or how will I get out of this. I'm also left wondering if it's due to my mental or if it's due to biological things. I'm also wondering what will happen from now, but atleast something will.

So bless the 2 policemen,
Bless my landlord who was worried
Bless the intervenants 
And bless the nurse.

Might update this if people care enough, just felt like sharing.",20Mar2019,10
42,"Hi peeps.

I'm in the EARLY conceptual stages of developing a script for what may possibly be an animated short film aimed at children and young adults, roughly in the 7-14 age range (just a personal project, nothing big). 

I would love to include a central character with mental disabilities in a way which is respectful, honest and grounded in a sense of authentic believably. Considering my own lack of detailed knowledge on the subject, I certainly do not want to fall into the pitfall of giving an ill-conceived cookie cutter portrayal. While I am doing research elsewhere online, I thought it would be a good idea to throw my current ideas here and garner any thoughts you all may have! I'm becoming quite fond of this character concept, but there's certainly lots of 'blank spots' concerning the mental disabilities aspect which need filling in. So below is my run down of the concept thus far. I'd love to see ANY thoughts or feedback you might have!

&amp;#x200B;

Brief story run down: A rag tag band of young Robin Hood-esque outlaws live in a secluded forest, on the run from a tyrannical fascist government. Ultimately a lighthearted, fun (and somewhat silly at times) adventure story, but with an underlying sense of depth and gravitas. 

&amp;#x200B;

My ideas for the character thus far are... 

\- The character (named 'Spenny': a young female around the 12/14'ish age range) has regular spells of panic attacks (only her closest friend 'Cassi' can ease her out of it). The aforementioned 'blank spots' I have with this, is what in the 'real world' might cause a young girl to have such a condition? And how might it manifest itself?

\- Towards unknown people (and in times of duress), Spenny may socially 'shut down' and not engage in an obviously vacant way (or at least adopt a very robotic demeanour during social interactions). But to those she trusts, she is OVERTLY open, extroverted and loyal to a T, in ways which can seem a little socially clueless, hyper and child like (or at least appearing far more juvenile and 'innocent' than her similarly aged counterparts). My 'blank spots' with this concept concern a seeming duality between what almost may be autistic tendencies (I.e incredibly withdrawn in unknown / unfamiliar social circumstances), juxtaposed with a kind of ADHD (i.e Supremely socially active in familiar / safe social circumstances). Is switching between one extreme to the other something that may happen with certain people in the real world? Or is that a bit 'pie in the sky'?

\- In spite of inhabiting socially awkward and juvenile tendencies (even for her age), she is SUPREMELY smart at certain specific niche things, in ways which even outclass many fully grown adults. To these things, she has a fixated obsession (in the case of the story, she's a master computer programmer / hacker). Again with the 'blank spots', I would assume this may point towards at least some manner of autism?

43,"I'm not sure how much help I can get on this particular subject, but I figured it was worth a shot. As the title says, I've been having panic attacks that jolt me out of my sleep nearly every single night for three weeks now. They usually occur around 3AM. I believe I handle them fairly well - I speak soothingly to myself, assure myself that it will pass, and enter a sort of meditative state by focusing on my breathing until it stops. I usually take my Klonopin as well, 1mg to 2mg under the tongue, but I've been trying to take it less because my monthly supply was recently cut into a quarter of what I'm used to. Despite coping fairly well when it happens once, I feel my mind being worn down from attacks every night. Is there any way I can help myself experience attacks less before I sleep? 

If some background is needed, I'm 20, female, diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression, struggled with panic disorder for about a year when I was a teenager, am medicated, and see a therapist once a week. I also am unable to identify any triggers that may be causing these attacks.

and in turn my father kicked me out of his house, i lost many friends, i lost the place i loved more than anything that i had lived in for over ten years.
i had a great job, i was ready to move on with my life and get my own house. everthing was going well for me. but the police would not give me my rights,
and bothered me for two months, after which my father kicked me out. when i left i moved in with my mother, and once again was not left alone to be given my rights
their response was to take away my medication, and once again continue to follow me wherever i went. i believe there were police undercover at places i went,
through all of it i was friendly to them, even though i was fairly certain their were police. they did this to me because i actually know at least some of my rights,
and they took many of my rights away.

my phycosis had been very undercontrol for seven years, and now that i had been doing so well, never abusing the substance, but to them too well, because i had become something they did not want,
therefor they through there own means took my freedom of expression, freedom of thought, in some way my freedom of travel. all when i had mearly followed through
with my rights.

i was once again destroyed by this system as i had been when i was young where i was showing signs of not doing well. instead of being given some kind of couseling
to resolve my issues i was left to deal with my issues among my poor family. as a grew up into my teen years i was once again failed by this system for my family
was still poor, and i once again recieved no couseling. in my adulthood i was admitted into the hospital after been left to deal with my issues alone for too long
i became a honest hard working man, but the police would not give me my rights. one of the officers made the chuckling joke that they were in her words were ""harasing me""
in my mind sometimes even jokes are a thought in your head, and are somewhat the truth.

when the realized i knew that i did not have to say anything to them, yet chose to say my side of the story, and nothing more, i was threatened with a false charge
after telling my side of the story, but they would not let my have my rights. even though i went beyond what i even had to do. in the end i am now a fragment
of what i was all because i was not given channels in my younger days to cope with what i had gone through. now that the system failed me in the past it continues
to fail me to this day. this is what the world has created through years of underlying issues that were never dealt with. it has created a mental state that can no
longer sustain itself, in return for my life as a near perfectly honest man that was given too many obstacles i have been removed once again from being allowed to be
what this world has created.

the scariest thing through all of this, is that my own mother is requiring of medication or else she will die. i may have been able to overcome this trickery
the govenment has commited in an effort to remove my rights and freedoms, but if this govenment dares to take mine, it is clear to me that this system that we live in
is completely and utterly corrupt.",20Mar2019,1

I've devoted my life to studying certain topics. I've grown in understanding a lot. I've produced some work I'm really proud of (music, photography, and more formal research in philosophy). I am very ignorant, but comfortable in that I know what I would need to work on to develop more.

But I'm just so tired. No one cares and probably no one will care about the stuff I produce. I'm just so tired. That's all I can describe it as. Why bother devoting my life or my energy to anything?

I don't expect any answers here, or even any positive comments at all. I'm just at the end of my rope and posting here is the only way I can keep going right now, in hopes that someone sees it. I don't really feel like anyone close to me understands (how cliche). I feel like an angsty teenager (I'm not--25M with a wife, house and lots of things to work towards).

But I dont know what to do with this. I know that contacting speacialists would be best but mental health issues are often looked down upon and not taken seriously in my country, especially among teens (im 16). And I dont want to bother my family with it since this year has been hard for us already and I dont want to make it even worse. And tbh I dont even know what I would tell them.

I can’t really remember exact ages. 

But I think I was around 8-11. It went on awhile but idk how long. 

Basically me and my cousin used to fool around. Both male. He’s 2 years older than me. 

I don’t know how it started but i remember sleepovers he would get in my sleeping bag and touch me. I also remember later liking it and thinking it was normal? Maybe even starting it? It’s all a blur

Currently I am somewhat petrified of sex. I’ve had some other traumatic experiences in that (nothing abuse related tho). Am 25 now and seeing a counsellor for drug use, depression anxiety and we’re working through a bunch of things. I think she thinks I may have as we keep coming back to it but I don’t like talking about. 

Like 90% I’m straight. 

A part of me thinks it was mutual or even that I was the instigator at some point. Could we both have molested each other? Did I molest him? Was it just normal young boy behaviour?

He also introduced me to porn around the same time.

53,"For the vast majority of the time i feel normal and down to earth, nothing really out of the ordinary, but there is a specific feeling and reaction I get at random times that makes me question my sanity. It goes like this: I'll be going about my day normally until I sit down, once I've found a seat the world around me seems to expand to gargantuan proportions, and sound becomes muffled. Looking out at the world from my own eyes feels as though I'm on the observation deck of a high-rise. After this my mind begins to hum near the back of my head, starting as white noise and escalating into vaguely human yelling, it always gives me the same feeling that getting in trouble with a loved one can give. I can try to shake my head but the only thing that happens is an increased sense of vertigo.

54,"This would be a more organized post if i were to write it later when i have figured some things out, but here it goes.

(I really believe I struggle more to understand myself more than other people. This process takes a very long time when I realize I have a problem.) 

Disclaimer: I have Inattentive ADHD

I have a problem with commitments that I make to myself and with responsibilities. A lot of articles that I have searched for have talked about people being scared of commitments, and I don't believe this is the case for me. A lot of articles talk about people forgetting responsibilities, and I don't believe this is the case for me. I struggle with commitments that I make to myself. I often forget resolutions and goals that I make to myself, or starting responsibilities is very very difficult for me to do. After I have started something that I need to do, its not bad, but starting them is very hard.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I just realized that I'm talking about two things that might be unrelated, but I'll give some examples.

&amp;#x200B;

I have told myself that I would love to get to know a certain person and that they're very cool, but I forget and never do anything about it. Those feelings of attraction leave me, and I sometimes can't find that attraction again if I don't see them often.

I am very interested in Electrical Engineering (which is what i study in college) and i would benefit and really enjoy working on personal projects, but I never complete them, or never get myself to start them even when I have ideas. Also I always forget my ideas.

I have been 100% on board with reading a certain book and decide that I could totally finish it, and decide where to buy it, and then the next day forget completely about it. Also I often start a book and never finish it. This whole thing makes me read much less frequently.

60,"Most people would say that normal kids play outside. Well at least they did when I was a kid. When I was younger, my mom wouldn't push me to play outside but did encourage it. And I loved the idea of it. Playing outside and feeling the cool breeze. The outside world seemed beautiful to me. But I never went outside. 

It wasnt until I was 14 or 15 that I was aware of how I acted, the way my breathing would slow down and my muscles would tense up when I'm out in public. It was like I was trying to hide or something. The first time I went to Disneyland, all I felt was incredible pain in my shoulders and constantly feeling tired. I noticed my body and my breathing and wondered, ""Was I always like this? Why?""

I think the main culprit is the way my mom disciplined me when I was being a brat. My father was not the greatest man ever. He was short tempered and violent. He hit my mother and I almost every other day. She divorced him when I was 5. But since then, when I would act out, she'd say ""That man (my father) is waiting for you outside. Behave"". And I did. Every day, believing he was outside waiting to hit me again set me straighter than any kid I knew. I never spoke unless spoken to. I sat up straight, looked people in the eye, said please and thank you, I was the ideal obedient child. I grew up that way. Afraid. 

But that's just one reason.

When I was much younger, before I hit 10, my family would go to swap meets. And that was my favorite thing in the world. Seeing all the old toys and games. My mom and I collected Chevron cars. The ones from the ads where they have eyes and talked and stuff. Whenever we found them I got really excited but also scared. See, everytime my mom handed me the money, told me to ask the vendor ""Excuse me? How much is this?"" Then hand them the money. 

I'm pretty sure every kid is at least a bit scared to do that. Talking to an adult, a stranger when you're just a wee pup is intimidating. I had the idea in my mind that they could tell me no. That they'd say something like ""I'm not taking money from a kid"". I guess I thought that adults had no sympathy for me because of how my father was. I remember clenching my teeth and my hands just before asking the vendors and it was always the biggest sigh of relief when they'd smile and say the price ""Five"".

Back then, like most kids I didn't understand money all too well other than you use it to get stuff and you work for it. One day at one of these swap meets, a vendor had 2 of those Chevron cars. For some reason I assumed I could only have one. There was a little orange one, the smallest one I've seen yet (my mom said it looked like me), and a family sedan with wood panels. I asked for the Sedan and my mom gave me the money to pay for it. But then she asks ""Don't you want both?"" I think this is when I felt guilt for the first time. I nodded and she was about to hand me another five dollars but I hid my face against her stomach. She brought it and I started to cry. 

Yea five bucks isn't much but all I knew was is she worked for those green pieces of paper. She took me and my sister to work after school and we slept under a metal table up until the store closed. Since then I've never felt comfortable asking my mom for anything. Even stuff I needed like school supplies. And this habit of not asking her for stuff extended into, not asking her for help, being uncomfortable to ask for help or small favors. I get incredibly depressed after my birthday and Christmas. Nowadays it's hard to even ask my girlfriend for a favor, sometimes it just frustrates me so much that I just break down and cry. I don't advocate for myself at all (probably why my last relationship was abusive).

I am afraid. Constantly. People who know me in person would say that's bullshit or that it's funny. People have called me stoic and dignified. Intimidating. Massive. A beast. I was always one of if not the first picked in teams when we played football. It made me feel proud and confident but also I was ashamed of being proud. If that makes sense. I don't want to be scary looking, intimidating or be called a beast. My father was scary, he intimidated me every day and stood over me while I cleaned up my toys. He was a beast, not me. I dont want to be like him. I look alot more like him than my mom and I hate it. I hate my own face.

I hate getting those compliments. I say thank you but it stirs up so much self hatred inside. It's to a point where I avoid looking at reflective surfaces in public, which are everywhere, to avoid seeing my face. It's to a point where I'm afraid to talk to people because eventually someone always eventually compliments me for being intimidating or big. I hate compliments to a point where any compliment only makes me feel like shit. My girlfriend once showered me with compliments and I burst into tears and begged her to not do it anymore, which made her cry because she has had boyfriends that did not like compliments from her.

Because of these things Im sure you'd assume I'm one of the shy guys. Nope. When surrounded by my friends I'm the loudest thing you'll hear. I've been told I have a good speakimg voice, thats probably the only thing I'm genuinely proud of and be happy to receive compliments for. (Probably because I dont remember my father's voice). A week before my graduation I was nominated along with two of my classmates (both of whom are really awesome and nice people. Wish i kept in touch) and I got a standing ovation.

But even with all of that, I'm still scared to talk to people. I'm scared of being outside and being in a crowd and getting in the way. My last relationship really did a number on my psyche. My ex broke up with me a month before graduation then the day before graduation she promised we'd get back together. I've never felt so used and unsafe in my life. I put everything I've I had into it and got nothing but pain and lies. In retrospect I don't know why I expected so much out of it. I guess I just wanted a win and to have a person to finally make me feel safe. She promised she'd be the one. She wasn't. And it left me in such a broken state that I was just not stable enough to be alone. Much less leave home and I ended up not going to college. 

All that time. My courage building up, making my own person, forgetting my father and now I'm just a scared kid again. Hiding in my room from whoever is waiting outside. Sometimes I think I messed up so much that i dont have a chance in this world anymore.

61,"Hello, this is my first post here so guess I’m a little nervous. I don’t wish to get into too much detail, but I recently remembered a traumatic/bad thing which had happened to me a few years ago and it’s basically been haunting me every day for the past three weeks.  

It’s not exactly the event itself, everything I do or seem to enjoy somehow gets linked to this thing that’s happened so I can’t really enjoy anything like I used to. Anything with no rational link somehow gets linked to this bad thing and I feel like I can’t enjoy it anymore, like I’m not allowed. Now whenever I try and find something that I enjoy, I mainly just feel empty or just not much emotion at all. All I really want to do is sleep.

It’s frustrating because I feel like I’ve been cut off from my past life where I used to have a burning passion for things and found joy, and now I just don’t feel that much or anything. The worst thing is I know I have a lot planned for this year, but I’m worried I won’t stop feeling this way. I have a concert next week and I’m ever so grateful to be going, but I’m so scared I won’t feel like I should be when I’m there. But the thing is I know I’m going to regret it for the rest of my life if I don’t go. But I guess I’m also scared because I think I’ll look back and remember I wasn’t feeling great then.

I don’t like to self-diagnose, but I’m pretty sure there are some elements of depression somewhere in here. I’m trying to get help from professionals as soon as I can. I have currently only been through the referral stages, so I’m not sure when exactly I’ll be able to begin some sort of therapy. I’m waiting on a reply, but with how things have been recently days just seem to drag out for so long. I’m struggling to concentrate on my studies because I just keep questioning, what’s the point?

Thoughts of taking my own life have crossed my mind, but only a few times. I don’t feel like I would do anything as of right now. I know how much it would affect my friends and family so I wouldn’t want to hurt them like this, and they’re practically the only things which are getting me through this right now. 

Any advice on how I can keep going through the here and now?

Thanks.",20Mar2019,5

This has something that has haunted me for a really long time. I just need to get it off my chest

I tried to kill myself when I was 16 years old, I had a lovely girlfriend at the time, her and I both had our own personal problems we were facing.. I was starting to hear voices and a screaming girl in my ear. on occasions I got very invested in delusional thinking.. unfortunately I am not100% sure what was the main reason for my attempt as the leading month to the event is lost in the void of my memory!? But I knew for a fact from the beginning it didn't have anything to do with her. 
I was sent to hospital and then a mental health ward for over a month and during that time with all the meds I was on I started to feel really numb with my emotions, i found it hard to communicate it's like I was now trapped up in a bubble.. I broke up with her once I left the ward and moved away to a home for mental health recovery. 
Everything went way to fast and everything tipped upside down. I guess I found it easy to forget my life back with my parent band cause i was not reminded of it and I really didn't want to be. I completely abandoned her in the cruelest of ways possible and the thing is, I didn't feel anything. I loved her but I couldn't access that feeling or any other happy feeling for that matter anymore. I started to get deeper and deeper into drugs and alcohol, that's all I would do. I didn't need to go to school anymore only the hospitals school two days out of the week.
A friend of mine and i got kicked out of the youth home for repeatedly breaking the rules around drugs and alcohol on the premises so we where homeless for a bit before a family let me live with them. I was on complete auto pilot until things died down and I semi settled in with the family. 
I started getting memories pop back up into my head about that night. It was very gradual, but it bubbled up.. I started hearing the conversation that night as I had downed all my pills and mixed it with alcohol.. mum calling the ambulance while my girlfriends dad was on the phone asking me what is happening, hearing my gf crying and asking why did I do this.. all I could say was ""it's ok I'm going to see my uncle"" not even taking any damn consideration about what she was going through. It reappeared a million times in my head , almost every night once I realised. I looked back and realised what day I tried to kill myself and it was our anniversary. I know I would have known that back then . But it was buried in my head so damn deep. I went through a  psychotic episode once this happened believing the devil was stealing my soul. I was bing tormented by monsters , the voices came back with a vengeance , my delusions got so strong I wasnt in any control it was the scariest time of my life.. now I'm trying to put myself together but this is the one I can't get over.

69,"10 years ago marks the beginning of my issues. Approaching the eve of my 24th Birthday I wonder if it’s a sign to end it all.

I write this curled up in bed after another restless night. Unable to sleep I’m on my 3rd sick day from work. I still attempt the odd jobs but I’m unable to face anyone without wanting to breakdown. This year it’s become a regular occurrence. Every week I’d say I’ve had to do it at least once, I try and make myself feel better but I’m stuck going round and round. I’ve spoken to my work before regarding my mental health. 

At first they were really accommodating, letting me go for therapy during work hours, asking how I am. But now I fear I’m becoming a nuisance... no longer asked how I am, and when I do take time off it’s usually begrudgingly. (I’m a full time Graphic Designer for a startup) I work on everything web, UI, documents, presentations etc. And always make up my work no matter the time of day. I guess I’m starting to worry how this all looks to my colleagues... only my manager and boss know how I feel but no one knows to what extent. This year is overwhelming. I have an Eating Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, Suicidal Thoughts and since last week I now have some crucial evidence against a man who groomed me as a child.

How do I ensure work knows I’m still putting the time in, but I just can’t face being in a cheery startup environment sometimes?

I do see a therapist... not that often anymore. But I do see her when needed. I’m not sure it’s helping, I’m not letting it help. My head is filled with depressive thoughts and I can’t physically move sometimes. Days are spent in bed picturing my next problem which will send me over the edge. 

I don’t go out as much as I do. Mainly due to my ED I’ve piled on the weight within the last year. Again a circle of feeling fat and ashamed to then making myself binge and be sick to them staying at home most days. 

I really only see one way out. I just can’t focus anymore. I don’t see any hope in the future. I’m worried my work will get rid of me. Leaving me unable to pay bills, or set aside any savings. 

My parents have never been there for me. And they know about all my issues. I come from a family who prefers to hide problems than face them. I’m worried this is all getting too much. 

How do I ensure I keep a normal work life and keep up a good appearance?

70,"Every day my partner texts to let me know he’s safe at work, but sometimes he forgets which can can result in me having an anxiety attack. It’s even worse when I occasionally call him after work to ask him something and he doesn’t answer his phone after several calls. At that point I become convinced that something awful could have happened even though he probably just forgot to turn his phone back on. It’s gotten so bad that at least once I self harmed to try and relieve the tension. I have Aspergers, anxiety, depression and possibly bipolar or borderline personality disorder, but I don’t know why I have such an extreme reaction to incidents like this. ",20Mar2019,10

72,"I'm not really looking for advice, I just want to know if this is ""normal"". (If you know any other subreddits where this would be more appropriate, please let me know.)

I'm 31F and this is something that absolutely no one in my life knows.

When I was a kid I didn't have many friends so I started creating people in my head. I'd give them names, imagine what they look like and, while alone at home, I would talk to them out loud and pretend to be them and talk back to myself. By the time I finished high school, I had a ""permanent"" group of head-people with really complex lives, family histories, personalities etc. 

However, I am now an adult woman, and I still have head-people. They're now adults, some are in relationships, some moved to other countries, they have degrees, jobs, birthdays, problems, happy and sad times, everything and anything that real people have.

In the past 10ish years, I've more or less removed my actual self from these ""fantasies"" so I just pretend to be any one of them and talk to the others, I come up with new topics of conversation, new issues to resolve, new big events to celebrate; I sometimes cry (as them, never as myself) or dance with them or complain to them (again, not about my own problems, but about their problems that I made up, rarely inspired by my real world problems) and all of this happens out loud in my flat when I'm alone.

The issue is - I have a boyfriend now, we've been together for about 2 years and we're moving in together in May. And I'm freaking out because I will never have the sort of privacy again to play out all of these things in my head. For some reason, these people give me comfort and the idea that I will lose them is really upsetting. Even now, when my boyfriend stays over for more than a week I start getting anxious to talk to my head-people.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to add a few more details: I still don't have many friends (I'm shy and introverted) and I don't think I have any serious mental issues. I saw a psychologist at school because school was making me want to die (not kill myself, just die), and I sometimes joke that I have lifelong depression (I have felt unhappy all of my life regardless of what's happening around me) but I've never actually been diagnosed with anything and it's never affected me so much as to seek help. I present ""normal"", I have a job and hobbies, I'm not very awkward, I'm physically healthy and clean.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never heard of anyone doing this - making up people and evolving them over the course of 20 years and feeling so attached to them - so I don't know how normal it is. I tried googling it but I always end up on schizophrenia which I don't think I have (I don't hear or see anything that isn't there). Do other people do this? Is it as intense as it is with me? Did this happen because I didn't have any real-life friends? Is it a symptom of something I should be worried about?",20Mar2019,31
73,"I am starting to suspect that I might have a serious problem. I think it is easier for me to make a list:
-people have been telling me I look ""gloomy"" (that's the best translation I could find)
-I have a lack of interest and enjoy of things that are supposed to bring me joy: college and general activities. Sometimes I feel that I just don't care anymore. Sometimes I feel like I care but I don't really know what I actually want. 
-I feel sad during great part of the day
-I have a difficult time getting out of bed and sleeping at normal hours (usually I am not sleepy until 4-7 am)
-Sometimes my body is hungry but I feel disgusted by food so I can't eat. Sometimes I am hungy but I don't want to move so I don't eat. Sometimes I crave food and eat lots of it. 
-I have low energy, I feel fatigue during great part of the day (I think that probably is due to my poor alimentation). Sometimes I feel I have low pressure and have headaches.
-So, in general, I have a very difficult time at mantaining healthy food and sleep habits (sleeping at night and being awake during the day, eating all meals, etc)
-I have self destructive thoughts and fantasies with suicide and death. Obviously my self steem is very low and I have a history of self harm (cuts on wrists although they were never deep, hitting my head against the wall, choking myself with a belt until I feel my head is going to explode so I stop, etc)
-I seek ways to avoid reality (lots of netflix, spending unhealthy amounts of time out of my house and sleeping at other people's houses, like my boyfriend or my cousin)
-in the last few months I engaged a series of ""reckless"" behaviours which I did not realise they were such until today: having unprotected sex, walking alone and drunk on the street at night, doing some drugs more often than I should (lsd 4 times in 4 months, marihuana on a daily basis although I stopped already, and I tried to do ecstasy the other day but it didn't hit).

The only ""new"" thing is the drug thing, and I think the marihuana actually gave me more anxiety. I must say that all of the others items were a reality during all my teen years, but they got worse since my mom passed away a year and a half ago when I was 18, now I am 19. When I was in High school at least she was alive (although she had been ill with ups and downs since I was 13) and my life was a bit more in order. Now I feel lost and I dont know how to get my sh*t together. I feel like I am neglecting myself. 
I was never diagnosed with anything so I don't know what's wrong with me. Thank you for reading and any supportive and informative message will be welcome",20Mar2019,2
74,"I’m trying my best to hold out at work until there is an opening at the local behavioral health center, but big things are happening and I can’t focus on anything. I’m not on any meds, I’ve cut off most of my friends and family so at least they don’t have to see me like this. At least I still have my parents to support me, I still have no one to talk to about this.

Now my fear is that I can’t get my short term disability cleared- my employer HR asked me for documentation from my doctor to “certify” my illness and to confirm my days out- he said normally they don’t get this bc the paperwork normally goes to the insurer, but I don’t want them to know I’ll be out bc of my mental health it’s none of their business.  I haven’t seen a psych in over a year mainly bc all the ones I’ve called in the past were booked up 3mos out.  I don’t know how to get them documentation except by asking the psych to send the docs directly to my insurance. I’ve filled out the paperwork for FMLA but I feel like they’re holding out signing it until I have a doc note.

76,"I've had on/off things with therapists for about 5 years now (talk therapy). 

A couple of instances of medication (1st via GP, 2nd from psychiatrist); the first time did a lot of good with regards to my lifestyle, etc. but I had issues with anger outbursts and losing my filter. 2nd time, medication seemed to make things worse and the psychiatrist was no help whatsoever, so I stopped seeing him.

I've had years in the past of using alcohol to self-medicate, which wasn't working any more. I started working on staying sober about 5 years ago. I'm near 1 year sober now this go around.

Fighting intense depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, etc. My job burnt me out completely, I'm barely able to get myself up to do things. In bed a lot, wishing for death.

IOP seems like a terrifying commitment, I don't know if I can do it. Not to mention I'm scared of medication aspect again, though I would hope such a place pays more attention to the patient and how they're feeling with it as opposed to my previous doctor experiences in that regard.

77,"To start off, my mom’s mental health has progressively gotten worse over the last 3 years or so and it’s drifting us apart and I honestly don’t know how to fix it. She’s been diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD from verbal abuse by her parents.

When she gets triggered to the point of an anxiety attack or PTSD attack (which happens quite often, at least every few days) she just breaks out in these fits of rage and often yells hurtful things at me. Logically, I know she can’t fully control her behavior when she’s like this because of her mental illnesses, but these things still hurt emotionally and they cause me to distance myself from her and feel like I can’t trust her. One of the reasons we don’t have a good relationship anymore is because she feels like I don’t want to be around her or do anything with her, which is partly true to be honest. But it’s not that I don’t want to, it’s because I’ve been hurt by things she’s said and ways she’s acted when she has those fits of rage and I guess I’m scared of getting close to her again and getting hurt. She often tells me that I act like I think I’m better than everybody else because I go to college (I’m the oldest of her 4 kids and she never finished college) and because I work (she’s a stay at home mom) and I honestly feel like part of the reason we’ve become so distant is because I make her feel insecure even though I’ve never made any negative remarks towards her about not finishing college or not working. I know that makes me sound conceited but I honestly think that she could possibly look at my successes and see nothing but things she wishes she had done and it’s causes her to resent me which could fuel the hurtful things she says to me in her rage fits. 

This stuff used to bother me a lot, for about the first year that her mental health really started going downhill, and I just wanted to do anything I could to please her and make it stop. But at some point I basically just gave up and stopped caring because I felt like nothing I could do or did do helped at all, but me giving up just made things worse. I’m tired of not having a healthy mother/daughter relationship anymore and watching her interact with my other siblings completely different than she interacts with me and I feel like I haven’t really done a whole lot to fix our relationship. I know most of you aren’t professionals, however I’m just looking for advice.


TLDR: my mom has anxiety attacks quite often that cause her to go into fits of rage in which she yells hurtful things to me which have caused me to distance myself from her and basically ruin our relationship. I also think it’s possible that my successes make her insecure and that too has contributed to the break in our relationship. Need advice on how to fix our relationship.

I’m a senior psychology major and I am working on a research project for my senior honors thesis. My project is on personal factors (e.g., personality, background) associated with depression and suicidality. The main goal of our study is to better understand certain understudied factors surrounding these experiences. We thought that the members of r/mentalhealth be interested in helping us better understand these questions.

If you are interested in participating in this study, please follow this link to our survey:

https://roanoke.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_3wqW7ukmxT2qZxj. 

Obviously, given the nature of our research question, this survey does include some questions about your past experiences with depression and suicidality; these questions are minimally intrusive, but if you are uncomfortable answering them, you are under no obligation to do so. The survey takes most people around 15 minutes to complete, and should take no more than 20 minutes. All of the information you provide will be completely anonymous.

86,"I just got up and out of class, “I need the office” excuse as I run out, because I had just absentmindedly punched the cabinet to my right because Jesus, I’m so angry. 

It started today with reading *Night* by Elie Wiesel. This shouldn’t make me spiral, but it instilled a negative energy in the day.  Next, in the hallway, is when it kicked in. I couldn’t get around people, so I said FUCK IT and bulldozed. Ever since I’ve been at high school I’ve always wanted to bulldoze these slow ass inconsiderate mother fuckers in the hallways. Now I was, but it was just in-fucking-furiating. I get to class, *throw*  my shit on a seat (not mine) and take the bathroom pass to go, well, piss. 

This is when it gets mixed with something else.

As I’m in the hallway, stalking to the bathroom, maybe for a breather, my girlfriend comes behind me and says hi. 

I just look at her, then keep walking.

Who. In. The. Fuck. Does. That. To their loved one? So she’s like “wow, okay” and storms back to her class. I just look, almost calling out her name but pride made me turn around and keep walking. I couldn’t fucking believe I was doing it when it happened. So now that the spiral REALLY is happening, I’m punching the fuck out of lockers and hanging my head on shit, as a slight distraction. So I go back to class, only to stay there for maybe 5 minutes. After texting her with relentless explanations and apologizes (she’s insensitive to this now, I’ve done this too often), I punch the cabinet to my right and the class and teacher fall silent. Without thinking even once, I got up, told her I need the office, and stormed the hell out of there. I’m sure everyone was surprised because the quiet little white kid just left the classroom, in anger. Well this wasn’t anger at this point; I was in complete shock and my adrenaline was maxed the fuck out. 

I love how I’m paragraphing this as if it adds to chronology

So I leave after wallowing the school halls in careless, crazy thought, somehow not caught by any APs without a pass. I go to my car and chill. I am here now.

87,"Hello.

I’m not sure if this will get much response but I thought I’d write this out to get a few things off my mind. 

In general I struggle to be in touch with my emotions, particularity negative ones. In general I’m just content. Not up nor down, just fine.

I find it quite strange when I experience intense  emotion, it tends to be both a physical and mental thing for me and I’m unsure if this is normal. 

I’ll give examples of both sides of the spectrum, last year I went to a brilliant summer camp and achieved so many personal goals and I was intensely happy for two weeks after, it was so strange for me, I was constantly buzzed.

And now, I’ve recently been dumped and there are a lot of issues that will ultimately remain unsolved and it’s sad but I can’t seem to let myself grieve.  Normally when something bad happens to be I just go numb, ( I’ve had depression since I was young but I’ve never had any help for it as I find it hard to be seen as weak) but this time is different. I’m trying to be sad because I just don’t know how to and when I become sad, I think to myself ‘okay I’m done now’ and it frustrates me that those emotions won’t just go away. 

Onto the topic of my title, I’be realised that I disconnect myself from negative things that happen to me. I think it started from when I was young and molested by my guitar teacher, and has continued through any negative experience I’ve had breakups etc.

I just can’t remember that it happened. Any of the good details or the bad. When I think about it abstractly I know that it did but it’s not accessible to me. I can’t remember any good times I had with exes, just vague details of the break up. Is this normal? 

Same with if I get the impression that someone doesn’t like me, I’m unable to remember any good times or chat we’ve had with one another just the one look they gave me that made me think that they’d gone off me.

I don’t know what I’m looking to get out of posting this. I think it may be that I’m just unable to be vulnerable. I don’t let others see my cry and if I were to describe myself I would say that I’m that funny friend, 

I’m there to make others laugh and be there shoulder to cry one but I’m a control freak on the levels that people see of me. Even the people I’m the closest with are unconsciously held from my deepest person which I’m okay with.

I guess my questions that I have for anyone reading is, does anyone relate? 

And also does anyone have any idea about how I can improve myself and steps to take to become more mentally aware I guess.

Also on the terms of depression, I am not currently depressed and haven’t had a bad episode since before Xmas. If I do get bad again, I think I will work up the courage to seek out help. I do chat about it with my friends sometimes and they are aware and look out for me where I let them.

Thanks for your help. Also I think I have to apologise for mobile formatting.

D. You have always been there for me. Whether I was happy, sad, mad, confused, you were there. You've been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I know I can count on you to be there waiting for me when I get home after a long day.  But lately, you have been coming by more often. I see you frequently now, when you only came by on occasion. What changed? Why did you want to get more involved in my life? Our relationship hasn't been the strongest, but you never faltered. Every time I told you that I wanted to see someone else, or take a break, you were patient. Waiting for me to come back. D, you always knew you'd be a part of my life. I just never knew how much you would be here. Yet, even though you are here, ever present, I still try to get away. Our relationship is... dysfunctional. Your words are a drug that I can't stop taking. I know they're poisonous but they take over before I can stop myself. You tell me things I don't want to hear, but I don't fight them. I don't want to fight with you anymore. I want to do one thing, you want to do another. Any time I want to see someone you push them away. I'm not allowed to date because you won't let me. I try to see others without you but you're waiting to hear from me when I get home. Sometimes you even show up unannounced. Usually you do...
I don't want to see you anymore. Go away. You're smothering me. Pushing people away from me because you want me all to yourself. Some days it's easier to just give in to you and stay home. When we fight you ruin my day. Even though I go out and see other people, your words repeat in my head. When you yell at me I can't think about anything else but you. I hate you. Why do you have to be so easy to give in to? Your embrace is cold, yet you cling tight as if holding me closer is going to give you some of my energy. And it works. You take that from me and never give me anything in return. 
Now thinking about it I never even get to talk when you are in a mood. I try to reason with you but you don't listen. It has to be your way or you get mad. Why do you stay? Why did you ever introduce yourself to me? I hate our fights but I can't prevent them. You're too persistent. You love me but I can't get away fast enough. Just LEAVE ME ALONE!!! GO AWAY!!!

We are highly focused and streamlined, yet loose and flexible (effortless effort being the motto). Our basic aim-quintessence is to harness all available energies to create an interdimensional rift/gate to haven that can propel us to 5th dimension and beyond while still connected to Earth but ultimately undergoing physical transfiguration, also fueled by the bowels of the earth likewise (as above so below)- which constructs a beastly cyclotron that irons out certain unwanted specific frequency-sets, diminishes their influence on the collective.

&amp;#x200B;

""As soon as humanity unites on this planet, it will qualify to establish contact with other more advanced civilizations, such as the Agarthans and those from the GF. In fact the Agarthans and some ascended masters such as St. Germain will already help us run the cities of light and the numerous healing centres which will manifest very soon all over the globe. The next step will be visiting other civilizations, but this could only happen after the incarnated human personality has completed the LBP and has ascended at least to 5D by transfiguring from a carbon-based body into crystalline light body.""

The three cities of light will be open portals to the multiverse and to numerous advanced humanoid, and later on, other civilisations, such as the dragons. Alone this fact will make the existence of national states and nations obsolete as all the people will recognize their multidimensional nature and will strive to ascend too and be able to live in these cities of light and enjoy the advantages of a higher dimensional life. In the first place, they will enjoy the healing possibilities there which will help all humans advance rapidly in their LBP and also ascend.

100,"I didnt really know how to sum this up in the title...long post I guess (english not my first language)

So to start, I left ""the home"" (because I dont consider that being my home - reasons below) in November after years of being mentally abused by ""parents"" for a rented place. I didnt have a lot of money &amp; I had to leave that place in late February . 


As another backstory - I dont know how many of you guys know or heard (not even something good) about Romania, but that's one thing media is absolutely right about - it's a horseshit of a country with almost half of the population leaving in the last thirty years. The jobs here are at least limited, I mean the average jobs that pay enough. Most of them work like this : work double,get paid half (as a comparison with someone working the same job in a better country).


Back to the main stuff...In this three months I was like half of the time happy (the other half containing PTSD episodes and other stuff all related to my childhood traumas).But still I was half of the time happy,that's 50% more than at ""home"" (where I was myself &amp; in a good mental place only when I was left alone in my room). I worked hard on being myself, trying to get rid off the bad stuff and for once actually being able to do what I like, pursue my dreams (I worked a lot on one of mine - creative writing)...I also started to learn a lot about making money online (like dropshipping stores, reselling, stuff like that). When the time was up and I didnt have any money left (I mean I had q few bucks but still), I figured I will stay to my cousin (the only person from ""family"" that I've talked too in three months) till I get a job (which I am starting tomorrow btw).
This is good, right? Well, the good part is that if this works out, I will be able to move to a cheap place in two weeks, the bad part is I dont know how to resist.


My cousin is a lot like the rest of the ""family"", no surprise I know, but he has his moments when he understands what the others dont - me being at his place is not normal, in a normal family it shouldnt have come to this. He says he has some kind of bipolar disorder but he uses it as a power (his words) when in fact all he does is get annoyed and yells for no real reason (example - yelled to me because i didnt record a conversation with an employer on the phone). His gf (he stays at her place 90% of the time) said the same thing about his behavior. He gives speeches about 5-7 times a day, reminds me every second to make eye contact with him, tells me that he doesnt want me to pay back (I offered because I am pretty confident on my overall knowledge and I really prefer to pay him than what he does now) but at every argument he brings the fact that he owns the place, threatened to kick me out for a night to ""really appreciate what I do"", tells me exactly what to say or act like, sometimes makes me say things like ""yes,sir"" (and if I say just yes, its not okay). He always changes his mind (almost made me choose the job he wanted for me - McDonalds, because he knows better as he said a lot lately because of his experience of working the last three years.Nothing before, now just a standard nine to five),he lies about not talking about me to ""the father"" (I caught him in the past, thats why I didnt share anything anymore and I wont share after I life his place) and many other stuff that I dont want to think about,those are the first things that came in my head.


I didnt have any other place to go otherwise I wouldnt have called him ever again. And to understand how important was that ""mental holiday"" for me, I would prefer to sleep on the streets than go back ""home"". The cousin tries to change my perspectives,views,everything, he wont be able to do that but it's hard for me to handle everything.


I am planning on talking to him some ""truths"" when I leave (how he is as manipulative as the other members from this fucking family and I didnt leave ""home"" to go to a similar place etc). 
What do you guys think? I am writing this because I am not confident enough about the whole situation. I didnt exagerate with the examples, most of them happened in the last few days.


Am I overreacting or any other thing? Thanks for reading.
Tl;dr : I had to move to my cousin and I dont know how to handle the situation/if I am wrong.",20Mar2019,1
101,"A little bit of context:
 I(25f) have relatively bad OCD.
My boyfriend(25) has a very active social life and I truly endeavor to have as little impact on this as I can. We have a fairly solid arrangement of seeing each other 2-3 evenings a week and I would be hard pressed to see him external to that agreement. 

As of recent my mental health is really quite debilitating and i would benefit from seeing him a couple of other days too but he makes me feel as though that is too demanding and he explains that he developed a level of Independence before he met me and that's how he would like it to stay. I don't really know if I'm asking for too much, I obviously don't want him to not see his friends but at the same time I feel completely alone in this shitstorm. 

Am I overstepping the mark? ",20Mar2019,2

105,"Hello. I'm 25F and have schizo-affective bipolar, borderline personality, PTSD, and severe depression. I've been legally/medically determine Seriously Mentally Ill (SMI) by my state (AZ, USA) which is considered a disability. It doesn't automatically grant me social security benefits, but it does grant me 100% behavioral healthcare coverage either until I die or am determined not SMI which only I can request be reevaluated of.

I've been receiving pharmaceutical treatment for about 3 years now, and individual therapy for 9 months. My doctor suggests I also attend DBT group therapy, but my full-time job doesn't work with it.

I got hit with a pretty hard bought of seasonal depression this passed December, which is unusual. I figured I'd snap out of it soon enough. I was very, very wrong, apparently. For 4 months it's only worsened. I'm reaching out at this time because it's finally started to affect my job. I've been late and absent with increasing frequency. This post follows a text I received from my boss about having a meeting about my schedule adherence next week.

I have enough savings to get by for a few months, and could tap into my retirement savings if need be for a few more months. My husband does not make enough to support the both of us. I feel confident in my ability to get a new job, as I interview well and have a strong resume. However, I worry about job hunting and finding new employment when I'm so ill. If I'm feeling too poorly to do the job I've been doing for 3 years, how could I possibly establish myself in a new job?

I have insurance on most of my credit cards and loans so that if I lose my job they'll be taken care of until I'm working again. But I have to become unemployed ""through no fault of my own."" If I'm fired for attendance, I think that's considered my fault. I also can't receive unemployment benefits if it's my fault as well.

What are my options here? I could apply for social security benefits, but that process takes months. What is considered ""my own fault"" when it comes to mental illness? How do I grapple with job hunting and new employment? Any other advice you have to share would be amazing as well.

Thanks in advance!",20Mar2019,1

107,"For the past month I've been feeling like a burden, like no one actually wants to talk to me. I feel desperate, unwanted and unloved. I had a breakdown today in front of a lot of my peers and a few people asked me what's wrong then totally forgot about it. I've never felt this way before. I know for a fact that some of the guys have spoken about me behind my back. One of them was one of my closest friends last year. Now we barely speak, and I've tried talking to him about it more than once but at some point it just got sad. I also feel physically disgusting and am blaming my recent unpopularity on my weight gain. I also feel myself becoming jealous of my friends that are getting attention (mainly from guys), and it's making me hate myself. I have a handful of super close female friends, and three really close male friends. Why can't I just be content with that? I think it's because my female friends are all from different friend groups, and the males are a part of the group that I feel doesn't like me. I'm aware of the possibility that a lot of this is in my head, but I'm sure there's truth to it. Any words of advice or support that you think might help? Thanks",20Mar2019,1
108,"So it first started when I was very young, because my neck was the place that most tickled me. My friends knew that I wasn't responding to their tickles in any body part except my neck so they would always target my neck when they want to annoy me.

Anyway, gradually, my neck has become more and more sensitive. I always feel the urge to pull the fabric of the top I'm wearing to cover it, and/or to surround it with my hand so that it is totally covered. I first need to note that I'm wearing a headscarf (hijab) which normally covers the neck so when I'm outdoors it is fine  because my neck is not exposed. But when my  headscarf is off indoors is when the problem shows. This urge increases specially in three cases: 
1- When there are people around. So if I'm alone like taking a shower or something, most of the time I'm not annoyed (unless cases no. 2 or 3 happen). So it mostly annoys me when there are people around me.
2- When my hands are busy. So if I'm washing the dishes or cooking or anything that makes my hand busy, the urge increases. And I can't resist it and just use my dirty/wet hands to pull my top to cover it multiple times during my cooking/washing.
3- When I think/talk about my neck. Like the whole time I'm writing this post, I'm more conscious about the existence of my neck and my need to protect/cover it. Also if I see a picture of a spider or an insect for example, as an unconscious reflex I just cover my neck with my hands because I guess I imagine it attacking my neck or crawling on it.

Any time I have been to a hairdresser or so on, and I take off my hijab, I use it as a neck scarf to cover my neck so that I can act normally. I also remember an incident that happened about a year ago. I was with my friends at a friend's house so my headscarf was off, and then a friend was about to tickle my neck and as a reflex I punched her in the face. She was shocked, and me too actually because I didn't realize it until I hit her.

So anyway, I just want to know if that counts as an OCD, and if someone has something similar because I searched but in vain. I also want to know how such OCDs are normally treated.

109,"First post to this sub, hoping to get some advice, thank you!!

&amp;#x200B;

\-&gt; So I had my first Dr's appointment to address my increasing anxiety and depression yesterday, and found some things a bit...odd. I'd like some feedback on a few things (just need to know whether some of the stuff I'm about to post is common, or not)

&amp;#x200B;

1.) A lot of the stuff was ""up to me"" and I was given questions I had no idea how to prepare for or answer. I went into this with a ""I have no idea what the hell is going on in my head, but it's bad, and I need to address it"" mentality. I have no idea why I'm depressed or anxious so much, only that I did NOT used to be like this.

*-  ""Do you think your Anxiety is caused by your Depression, or your Depression is caused by your Anxiety?""* 

*The answer? I honestly have no idea, I'm coming in with my own mind being a total mystery to me. I didn't know it had to be either one of these.*

*- I was asked what ""kind"" of medication I think I should be on (given a choice between Wellbutrin or another unnamed medication that attacks both Anxiety and Depression together)* 

*- I had no idea how to answer this either, I don't know. When I made this decision I was only 30 minutes into discussing this with a medical professional for the first time in my life, I have absolutely no clue.* 

&amp;#x200B;

2.) After this short 45-minute single appointment with a Psychiatrist, I walked out with prescriptions for Wellbutrin XL and Vistaril. I haven't taken either yet, because I'm not sure that's right for me. I just feel like 45-minutes wasn't even close to enough time for me to ""explain me"" and give enough information that a Doctor could make a decision on the right medication for me. And I **know** that antidepressants and medications of this sort are a total crapshoot, but even given that, I don't feel confident that I'd even be taking a **good** crapshoot from a single 45-minute appointment with a brand new doctor.

*- Is that notion true? Are antidepressants and medications like this still a total crapshoot? Can't doctors to prior testing to figure out how a particular medication will affect an individual? It just feels odd...coming from a world I'd previous known (getting diagnosed and treated for migranes) where everything was ""testing testing testing! MRI and Cat Scans and Blood tests and this and that!!!"" before being able to figure out something that works for migraines. But now with my mental health it's just ""idk, we'll throw this against the wall and see if it sticks."" Makes me incredibly uncomfortable.* 

&amp;#x200B;

3.) When taking my first steps to address my issues a few weeks ago (and making this appointment with a psychiatrist), I had **absolutely no idea** what kind of doctor I'm supposed to see, what is recommended, or who even ""diagnoses you"" with depression or anxiety. I don't want to self-diagnose, it just doesn't feel right. (After this appointment I still didn't feel like I was ""formally diagnosed"", just given medication).

*So I chose this Psychiatrists office because they had decent reviews of any I could find. I made an appointment before I understood that the ""Psychiatrist"" is the one that mainly focuses on drugs and medication, NOT therapy.*

*- Does ""formal diagnosis"" happen? What kind of doctor does that? Or is that a totally false preconceived notion I have.*

*- What kind of doctor is it most common to see first? A psychologist, CBT, psychiatrist, therapist? I just don't know all the terminology.* 

&amp;#x200B;

The path I've currently chosen: I've not taken my medication (not started), cancelled appointments with this psychiatrist, and gotten an appointment for CBT with a therapist first, which feels like a ""safer"" path for me.  As much as I want to address my issues NOW (I'm impatient), going straight to medication just didnt feel right...

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on a rant about just how difficult it has been for someone with no prior experience trying to deal with this new situation in American Healthcare, but I won't. I don't know how we're even supposed to know where to start, who to go to, etc etc...",20Mar2019,1
110,"I'm new to reddit so I don't know if this is were I should be writting this to or not. Also sorry for spelling mistakes grammerly isn't working; also it's 3 am.

I've been thinking that I have depression for a long time now. I was kinda fucked up as a kid, had a lot of issues with behaviour, indivuality, thinking about myslef and others, self-essteem etc. I wasn't very smart, kinda in my own head and feelings, my mum was suggested I see the therapist but didn't bc I guess she couldnt afford it and I never saw the school conseller bc I didn't think too/didn't want to talk. I wish I did espeiialcy in HS. 

I've been thinking of putting my self though therapy but I don't feel like I should. I think I have a mental illness but at the same time I don't? I read about illnesses, I read the symtoms list and check a few boxes but when I read up on the illness I feel like my case (if i have one) is not bad enough to see a doctor about. So I forget about it. I don't want to take up space, I feel like I should save that for people who have it much worse. 

I'm young (19) and I don't know myself that well. Maybe I'm conusing common things everyone experiences with a disorder. Maybe I just have a light case? Maybe my 'symptoms' are just parts of my personality? 

I don't know if I'm self isolating or just a loner/introvert. I havn't had friends or spoken much to anyone (not even my family) in almost 6 years. I just feel like I can't connect with people, I kinda become a different verson of me when I'm with others and I hate that side of me. I feel lke I'm my best self when I'm alone. 

Maybe I just need to get out. Listen to that middle aged ladies on facebook and drink some lavender essential oil or whatever. (I'm not gonna do that btw I was just kidding)

112,"I strongly feel the need to share this anonymously. I recently admitted myself for a bipolar episode and subsequent exhaustion. I’m in the psych ward now. Here is how I arrived-

Some context is needed. Bipolar and schizophrenia have deep roots in my family system. I personally ordered a 5150 hold on my cousin last week-twice. On the other side of the family my uncle and grandpa were criminally insane with bipolar delusions. My grandma drank herself to death in her 40s.

Now to the story. 

My cousin is drawn to the hood when he’s in an episode, because he can talk and tease with people on the streets and it’s much more socially acceptable to just chat and hang out on the street. The only problem was that this particular part of the street was run by the bloods- I’ll leave out the specific set for safety reasons. Long story short, my cousin was shot (grazed?) in the back of the head for calling someone a bitch while shooting dye on this same street. He is alive and well.

I’ve had escalating mania with some delusions, but driving into Watts to get my cousins stuff forced me to suppress those bubbling feelings while also staying hyper vigilant. 

I was able to get the stuff, but immediately broke down thereafter. I had my first panic attack while crying and i could feel myself clawing at the edges of my own psyche. Delusions, mania, confusion, insomnia etc.
I voluntarily admitted myself with the support of my friends.

Anyway, safe and sound now. Seroquil is a hell of a drug.

113,"Hi there, I've been looking for the right place to post this, I believe this is the place. I'll be using they/them/they're/their to refer to the person.

Me and many of my friends have been very worried about someone we are all close with. We've all only known each other for a year through school, and recently we all graduated. I live farther away from where everyone else is located so I haven't been able to see this particular person as much. Recently they have been acting very out of character and odd, and it is something all of us have noticed.

I know for a fact they have been using strong THC pills almost everyday, as well as using Psilocybin mushrooms very often. The few specific examples are, recently, they told one of us that they're creating ""the matrix/an artificial intelligence"", and they also brought up a story they were told about a guy they met who was apparently being followed/surveilled by people on the sidewalk. They have also been posting very obscure things on social media.

I'm pretty sure they have dealt with depression, as throughout the year I saw a lot of signs of it. I don't want to make an instant assumption of that, but a lot of them were things I used to do when I dealt with depression a few years back. I also know their parents have a history of dealing with mental health issues, but I can't remember what they were exactly.

We have convinced them to stop the drug use for 2 weeks (we'd like it to stop completely but they wouldn't agree to it), but I feel like we need to contact their mother, and a professional to help them, as the mother lives far away. We are just unsure if they will agree to see someone for help.

I know this is very personal, but I'm just looking for guidance in how I can help. I'm incredibly worried and want to do all I can to help them.

114,"Hi all,

I'm using a throwaway here because this is not an issue I'd want to associate with my normal account.

For some background, I have been diagnoses with ADHD as an adult (21) and have been on medication for 3 years now. I am also trying to tackle anxiety through CBT. I'm in my mid 20s, in the UK and am generally pretty social and good at controlling my underlying anxiety. 

Throughout my life I have had a very strange tic, however I am not entirely sure when it started and what condition is causing it. Note that I had this tick prior to being diagnosed with ADHD or seeking help for anxiety so it is very much ingrained.

I have this tic whenever I get worked up by something, causing a vivid imagination with a strong emotion attached to it. This emotion is usually anger or happiness. I get worked up about it in my own head and it builds up to a climax and then releases. However, this vivid imagination has lead to me rubbing my fingers very hard on my teeth and occasionally making a humming noise. I know, this is weird. I want to point out that this generally only happens when I am alone. Here are a couple of examples:

1) **Happiness:** I'm watching my football team win a game and start daydreaming about us winning the next 5 games and winning the title. This daydream is one of euphoria/jubilation. This may also tie in to built up anxiety since I tend to feel anxious during the game. In some circumstances, I may end up having the tick. This tick often happens after much fingernail biting anxious reactions.

2) **Anger:** I'm reading a politics post on Reddit or Twitter, read some comments and it builds up a hypocritical picture in my head. There is a general underlying emotion of anger. Again, I have this quick imagination tick which lasts for 5-10 seconds or so.

---

These are very infrequent reactions however I'd like to identify this issue and tackle it. It has caused one of my fingers to be quite calloused and is one of the reasons why I like watching sport etc alone because I know I can have these anxious imagination ticks. 

Has anyone on here encountered anything similar before? I don't want to speculate on what might cause it but it might give me ideas.",20Mar2019,1
115,"I don't know where to start. I've made an appointment with my PCP for today. I just moved here and I haven't met her yet.. This isn't the ideal first appointment I was hoping for. I however have called any mental health facility in the area and they are overrun with patients and can not see me , so my PCP is the way I have to go. 

I'm not sure how to approach this because I am embarrassed. I don't think I have depression or anxiety but I feel like if I told my dr I was having severe depression issues that, that would be the easiest route to medication. I am embarrassed because I'm having explosive anger. It's gotten very bad. I've been averaging one horrid episode a month where  I have destroyed personal property. I know my partner really wants me to get help. I'm between therapists with the move but I'm on many wait lists! The first availability isn't for another month. 

I want to be honest with my PCP but I don't know if I can own up to the fact that I am a raging bitch that is abusive when I'm in one of those episodes. I think it would be easier to fake depression. What's the harm? I also fear that my PCP won't want to prescribe meds for anger after meeting me one time. I however feel like I need to medicated.  I'm so lost, and so embarrassed. ",20Mar2019,1
116,"Can I be denied my antidepressants because I wont see a psychologist? My psychologist sent me to a specialist to work out prescriptions. She basically felt like I should try medication because I’m well adjusted and not like traumatized. I have a good life, supportive friends and family, I like my job etc. But I’ve been depressed since I was 7. I’ve just always felt tired and sad and had day dreams of my demise. 

And now I’m kinda figuring out medications and they’re more or less working. But they are telling me to see a psychologist again.

I’ve been depressed to one extent or another literally my entire life. And I’m not the kind of person who wants to share their feelings or even details of their life. I’m a very private person.

This specialist hasn’t out right said they are going to cut my medications off if I don’t see a psychologist, but this is the second appointment in a row where I’ve been told to find one and make an appointment.
If I go into my next appoint again and haven’t made an appointment, can they refuse to fill my prescriptions? On account of them telling me to see someone else and me not doing it could be considered as a patient refusing to follow a doctors treatment plan.... ",20Mar2019,6

118,"[x-post from r/depression]

My physician (not psychiatrist) lately has been urging me to try or consider using antidepressants she would be prescribing. Two facts that might be cause for alarm:

* She is hesitant to schedule me an appointment with an actual psychiatrist, saying the psychiatrist in her department has a very full schedule. She assures me she should be able to competently prescribe and oversee medication use on her own.

* Rather than describing the medication and it’s (side) effects in detail, she just gives me brand and generic names to research on my own at home. 

Are these cause for concern? If so, how much?

EDIT: She also told me not to use my sun lamp anymore after she saw I had gotten sunburns, even though I reported access to the sun helping my mood. (I might not, in fairness, have gotten across that those burns were from sunbathing rather than sun lamp use.)",20Mar2019,2

I started using DPH(Benadryl) again, to calm me down, I started to rely on them too much so I threw them in the back of my closet where I can’t get to them.

My class had sexual misconduct seminar and I couldn’t stop shaking and twitching, then i stiffened way too much and couldn’t move. I had to get a guitar pick out to busy my fingers.
I noticed all these blank spots in my memory, and reoccurring ptsd symptoms from an event earlier this year which the school and police did nothing about, I also am beginning to suspect that I was sexually assaulted when I was very young with faint memories of the event.

Nothing was ever done and I’ve sense moved and lost contact with the person, I don’t even remember his name. When I told my family when I was younger they brushed it off and left it at that. The few times I’ve brought up my feelings I’ve been ignored or brushed off.

128,"So this is a personal anecdote of my experience with my mental illnesses. I developed depression, anxiety and an eating disorder when I was 15 after emotional abuse from my friends. It worsened after my mum had a stroke and I had to call an ambulance for her (she's fine now but would've died if I hadn't called, then my dad got cancer (fully recovered now) and then my mum almost died again twice due to a botched surgery. Naturally this caused me to be in a really bad place and I only got therapy when my parents were told that I self harmed (I did it for over a year before someone read my diary and told them). After a year in therapy I wasn't improving and eventually I had to leave school because my mental health severely impacted my grades.

This was the best decision I have ever made. It's cliche but I started recovering after I got my first boyfriend. I stopped self harming because I didn't want him to see that. Then he also appreciated me for who I am which boosted my self confidence. I had basically almost completely recovered thanks to him. 

Now when I say don't expect perfection I mean that recovery is an uphill battle. Even 6 years later I still class myself as depressed as I have periods of time (usually during high stress) where I fall back on my old habits. I definitely have anxiety and am taking medication for both of those disorders as I can't function without them. Also I found out that when I recovered from my mental illnesses I had developed a chronic pain disorder which continues to have a major impact on my life. Yet now that I'm in a better mental state I can get through it easier than if I were still as depressed as I used to be. My sister is also suffering from a severe mental illness since she was younger when my parents got sick and she also went through severe physical and emotional abuse from kids at school. She's currently in a mental ward and it's really difficult to say the least. 

Even though things in life still aren't great I'm loving being alive. I worked my way up from having no grades to attending my first choice university and getting the grades I want. I've also achieved everything I wanted to when I said to myself that if I didn't die, this is what I wanted for my future. I have great friends that support me with all my problems and they understand what I'm going through. 

So why am I telling you this? I want to let you know that you are not alone in this world. Someone will always care about you even if you think no one does. As someone who has been both suicidal and seen a family member be suicidal it is never the answer. Even if you believe that no one cares I can guarantee to you that they do care about you. Even if you have friends right now that aren't the best friends you'll find your people at some point in life. Hoping for a better future got me through the worst times and if you end it, you'll never be able to see the beauty in life. Keep hoping, keep fighting and keep safe. ",20Mar2019,1

I have anxiety that other people are always looking at me, thinking about me, or judging me, to the extent that I sometimes don't even like to be seen by people.

131,"My time in my first school left me with an immense fear of going to school.

&amp;#x200B;

During my time there, I was teased because of my weight and was disliked by most of my teachers. I was a bit heavier than my classmates (but considering I was quite tall for my age I'm pretty sure it evened out) so in typical fashion of clueless 6-year-olds, they took it as a weakness and mercilessly teased me anytime they could. 

&amp;#x200B;

The teachers were no better, I wasn't the brightest child and often acted out or fidgeted with my surroundings leading to many time outs and harsh scoldings. It was also a very strict and religious school which clashed horribly with my short attention span and my tendency to hide books under my desk.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while of the treatment, I grew tired of it. I simply had no drive or motivation to go to school again. I got average grades at best and flopped with social interactions, so why should I try anymore? I would dread waking up and stepping into my parents' car as they drove me to school, kicking, screaming, and hurling meaningless threats at them as they attempted to drag me to my classroom.

&amp;#x200B;

This led to me missing out many school days and eventually transferring to another school (which was more okay-ish). But the damage had been done. I fought every single day to stay at home regardless if I had made friends or not. I simply hated going to school.

&amp;#x200B;

I took another entrance exam two years later into a extremely prestigious and well-known school. I got in, surprisingly, and my parents were ecstatic. They immediately enrolled me into the school just when I was beginning to comfortably settle in to my second one, dragging me into a new environment I was unsuited for.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I fought to stay home and the cycle would repeat again. It got better as the years progressed but I would still weep secretly in the school bathrooms, yearning to go home and not have to deal with any of the school pressure anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I knew it, Grade 7 rolled around and thus began my change into middle school. This year, I was adamant on not going to school. I was much bigger now so my punches were not soft and caused damage when I wanted to and that was the turning point for my parents to begin taking it seriously. I wasn't just a grumpy 6 year old they could just haul into the car, I was a full grown woman that was a serious cause for concern. During this period. I stayed home from school for three months, everyday resisting and putting up the fight of going to school.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I left the school and turned to online schooling instead. I flourished under it and finished my 7th grade and 8th grade using it. But now I'm between a rock and a hard place. (Intl) Schools in my country were very expensive and hard to get in, and how was I to explain my two year gap? With that in mind, my parents contemplated on sending me to an overseas boarding school. Originally, I agreed with them. A change of pace would be nice for me and I could use the independence, a lot of my friends are leaving as well so why not? But then I thought about it long and hard. What if I hate it? What if I can make no friends? What if my mom’s not there to comfort me? What if I regret it? The more I thought about it the more worried I became. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, I'm very much a home body and the two years of practically home schooling made me even more of one. However, the prospect of boarding school seems so fresh and exciting! So because I'm generally a dumb person, I've decided to let redditors decide my fate! Do you think I should go to boarding school, or not?

I read through the rules of the sub, i hope i dont break any rules with my post here, if i do i apologise, i just need some helpful insight. This post will be long, im sorry.

Growing up was kinda hard for me and my siblings, my mom had many different boyfriends, saying that the last one was crazy and or a terrible person, which some were but not all come to found out recently. I am the second oldest of 4, we all have diffrent dads. My older brother is the son of my moms first boyfriend, growing up he was never around, my mom ALWAYS said he was a terrible guy, which he was alittle, but she made it seem like he was the fucking devils spawn who ruined her life, said the same thing about my father, and my oldest sisters father, catching on? Well i always believed her about it and avoided them always like they were disease. Well recently i found out, like shes done millions of stories throughout my life, she lied, ALOT. I asked many family members and they all said she lied. Thats another thing, my moms current husband, the one i was forced to call dad at a young age, my little sisters real dad, my mom and him have pushed away our whole family, say that they are evil, liars, pieces of shit, she had gotten a restraining order put on my grandma for a year when i was little cause she picked us form school one day with out telling her and she lost. Let me add, my grandma was the one who baby sat us when she worked, the one who bought us clothes and school supplies every year, took us places when she would go on dates to go live it up, the one who taught almost everything. My mom was 17 when she had my brother, &amp; almost 19 when she had me. She's always treated family like shit, still does, she doesnt like when anyone tries to tell her a different way to do things or what shes doing wrong, she doesnt talk to any family, not even her brother. Ive gotten kicked out of her and my bipolar step dads house more than 10 times cause i told them my opinion, neither of them work at age 39 and 43, all they do is smoke pot and watch tv. The first few times i got kicked out is because i called them lazy and pot heads and to get up and raise my sister better. The only time they really tired is when someone would be mean to her at school and my dad would go up there and cuss eveyone out. Hes knows for causing scenes places. He ended getting me and brother kicked out of school one year and we had to go another because he went to school and had a scene over my sister getting hurt on the bus on accident. Hes always told me ive been super senstive cause i cry easy, gives me advice when i dont want it, gives half ass apologies, threatens my brother and mom and has hit them, &amp; i have to step up threaten him, hes abused almost every animal ive ever had and has made me get rid of them. Hes made my life hell and i think hes the reason my brother is my narc, or maybe the three of them are or the 4 of us, i dont know.

  My dad had a breakdown after my mom attempted suicide, when she got back home from the hospital he kept us all locked in a closest as he screamed and threatened my mom and anyone who came to the door that he hurt us and then himself. At least thats what im told. I was the one who found my mother in the bath tub that day, &amp; I've tried to bring it up to her and my brother and they dont think its that big of a deal, im just senstive they say, which i am, i cry alot and get hurt very easily. But growing up till me and him gor kicked out and had to go separate ways he was very verbally abusive, my brother, he would say i was crazy alot, insult my intelligence, say things didnt happen when they did, never apologise, and act like he didnt hurt ny feelings alot. I would get very angery when we would have arguments, id hit him alot cause hed just keep going and going and i couldnt take it anymore.  My father and brother were the main reason i started and had thearpy for a year, till i couldn't afford it.  Its been about a year without any verbal abuse or physical abuse in the family, cause i had my apartment for awhile after i got kicked out the last time, but now im back cause i had no where else to go, &amp; now they are happy to have me back cause they know i cant stand dirty shit and they just love asking me to do everything.


my dad has always like people being intimated by him thats why he screams and breaks shit, he always has to be the smartest one in the room, he wants eveyething done for him without asking, hes a big ass hypocrite. My mom is his enabler, i think i got that clear. Or maybe the both are narcs, they both have been diagnosed with bipolar. But lately, for the past year ive started to think that its me, im very distant with my parents and siblings cause the past.  Ive had anger issues growing up, mainly with my brother, step dad and video games, ive never been good at arguing so when i get overwhelmed i get physical, i cry very easily at critsismes even small ones cause i feel like a failure. I used to have a few friends i could talk to but i dont have any now, my brother and i ruined them by choices we made with drugs. I rely on my girlfriend for alot of reassurance, love and support but ive asked her if i may be a narcissists and she thinks i may be covert .whenever in around my girlfriends family I feel like im a crazy person, like they are all so nice, lovely like hugs all the time, long conversations, gifts, and yanno family stuff and its so amazing to me but its so unusual for me so i sit in silence alot with alot of anxiety and think when i first dissociated was when i was at her grandparents.  I think i have depression and anxiety, maybe bpd, npd, or maybe even aspergers cause i get overwhelmed very easy, i also clean to compensate my bad personality traits, i also clean to avoid feelings of  inadequatecy and anxiety, my family likes to joke im ocd and i might be i have no idea. im trying really hard to not self dignose, i look up mental health information at least 3 hours a day...
I  just found out about fleas which is possible i have or gave them i dont know.  I cant afford to go to therapy right now, im really just look for someone to talk to, hear their stories and talk one on one. Im very sorry for the long jumping around story, i just needed to get myself out there alittle bit to see if its me or one of my family. If you have any questions please ask so i  clear things up or tell you more and talk if you want. Thank you for reading and im sorry for my ranting, this will probably get deleted",20Mar2019,1

TMI but I just had my first ever pap smear and it was so stressful. 

As someone who's been sexually assaulted and deals with chronic and debilitating anxiety, going thru with this appointment was huge for me. My therapist has been hyping me up for weeks to go and has been very understanding of my reluctance.

Ive cancelled this appointment 6 times because of nerves. I've wanted my mom to come with me for moral support and she's continuously made me feel like I'm being ridiculous and that i'm overreacting.

I told her I cried during part of it and almost fainted (lol) and she told me I had no reason to feel like that because everyone has to do it. And that no one else gets upset.

139,"I'm 24, and one of my best friends from college either killed himself or overdosed earlier this year - he had a lot of mental health issues spring up recently, and I know I couldn't have done more (I just wished I'd stayed in better touch with the few months before - was literally going to call him the day I found out because I had just visited his hometown for work and he loved to rag on where he was from - he was funny as hell). For about a month, I've been going through bursts of hopelessness, anger, sadness, and fatigue. Its like every time I slow down or stop doing an activity, one of those four emotions hits me. Its been impacting my work, I'm afraid if I go drinking with my friends I'll just start crying, and I was smoking a lot of weed just so I could do things I usually do, like go to the gym. Without substances, I find it hard to get myself going again if I stop and get in a rut. I probably smoked too much on weekdays and drank too much on weekends before this, but it wasn't interfering with my life in any real way. Going hard one night on the weekend, smoking when playing video games at night - maybe before a long run or some not too strenuous activity. My substance use didn't bother me until now and I don't think it should've even if I was technically an addict.

Now, its like every time I stop, I think to myself: ""My friend is dead"" and it all hits me again. I'm angry at so much. When I'm walking home from work, I feel like I'm looking for a fistfight with any car or pedestrian that isn't following the rules - I used to justify this because I've almost been hit by cars loads of times (still fuck drivers, and all the cyclists that don't know what the fuck a turn signal is). The only time I feel ok is when I'm focused in on a sport or task at work. I'm happy talking to people too - its just that when I'm in my own head, basically by myself, that I feel negative, depressed (I saw being angry is in the depression realm). My grandma passed not too long ago last year, and that hit me hard (she could've done a lot more for her health), but it wasn't like this - I was so busy with working full time and finishing school that it was like I was able to literally work out all my feelings, but it doesn't feel the same now. Like when I'm doing sports for example, I kind of think how happy he'd be at my effort/performance (he was a great and super supportive bloke), like I'm doing whatever well and that'd make him happy, but I don't know if thats good. Like I'm trying to channel my emotions through that, cause I know how he suffered from depression, and I know he wouldn't want me to suffer like that, he'd want me to do great at all the things I do. I wouldn't ever kill myself, but I thought for a split second about shooting myself (I don't have a gun, I'm not harming/going to harm myself). Sometimes, I just feel like I want to leave my current life behind, and go do something completely different in a more isolated, simpler place. I just feel so fed up with where I live, what I do (even though I love my job), all the people around me with misplaced priorities, and all of the burdens. Like I normally think most people are shit (tbh for good reason), but this is more anger than disdain. 

Usually I'm pretty chill, engaged/focused, and motivated. Now when I'm like that, sometimes it just feels like a facade.

Writing this all out was really helpful, and I think I'm going to write more.

Basically, my friend died, I think I'm depressed, but I don't know what to do. I've talked to my friends and girlfriend some about it. I don't want to see professional help: I'm cheap (they're fucking money grabbers here and I don't want medication - see my dissatisfaction with society bit), and I think I'd prefer talking with people I already know, and who knew my friend. 

Do I just need to buck up and get professional help? Should I schedule some time to talk with my friends? Go sober? Throw myself into my work? Do some mushrooms? I have never been this down for this long and I don't know what to do. Thanks for taking the time to read my spiel.",20Mar2019,2
140,"In the UK. 

I saw the doctor yesterday after suffering with severe depression and anxiety since October. 

I’ve been on 3 different types on medication and I’m now at a point where I just hate myself. I’ve had suicidal thoughts previously where my medication was changed and they seem to have settled a bit. 

I’m not obsessing over what I eat. Sometime I eat nothing all day, others I hate one meal a day and others I binge then make myself sick. I’m high then low on different days. Picking at my skin when anxious and just generally hate myself and the way I look. I also impulsively bought some coloured smoke grenades for my wedding next month, everyone thinks I’m nuts. 

Has anyone had any experience with what I’m going through? Or any experience with the mental health teams? ",20Mar2019,1

142,"I'm a 36 year old male, living in Canada. Married six years. No kids. I work in tech and bring in a good salary. My wife is disabled.

I am normally a sedate, calm person. I am known professionally for my ability to adapt and just go with the flow.

Last night, we went to bed as normal. At about 12:30, I was dead asleep. My wife's pain was so much that she started having a panic attack. She began to pray out loud to herself. Somewhere in this process, she woke me up.

Normally, when my wife wakes me up, I either half-sleep through it, or I help her through what she's doing. And I mean normally as in this has happened hundreds of times in the eight years we've been together.

This time, I got angry. Like irrationally mad. I was holding myself back from yelling and screaming at my wife who was clearly just going through a bad time. And it was obvious I was angry. So she started to get scared and upset on top of being sore and panicky.

I don't want this to happen again. I don't know where to start looking for a solution. If anyone has experience with this kind of sudden, irrational personality shift, I'd love some resources.",20Mar2019,1
143,"Do you find that people never seem to ask you if you're ok anymore? I seem to find that people only ask me if I'm alright as a greeting and I just say.""yeh, and you?"" And that's the end of that. 

People very rarely actually sit down with you and ask you how you're generally doing anymore and I feel that if more people would do so then a lot of issues would be spoken about more. Maybe talking about it more and asking a simple question would help end the stigma surrounding mental health. 

I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to start a conversation about how I'm doing. I don't like making it about how I feel. I know if I was always asked how I'm doing then I'd talk about it more. I know that it'll make me feel better. 

I sit at my desk at work with my head in my hands most of the time. I'm trying to hold myself together, trying to not have a breakdown. If one of my colleagues turned to me and asked if I was ok then I know I'd start crying. I know I'm not ok but that interaction has been made and then I'm able to open up a little. But people don't seem to ask each other the question that in my opinion can make a whole lot of difference. 

I just feel like a simple ""how are you ACTUALLY feeling today?"" Would help so much and it really would make a huge difference.

144,"So I haven’t really ever been in the game when it comes to talking to women (I’m a 21yo male). My mental health plays a huge roll against my ability to do so. Recently I added this girl I’ve had a crush on for a few months on snapchat. That was four days ago and she still hasn’t added me back. My friends who talked me into doing it are now telling me that I should move on but I’ve been hung up on her for so long now that I feel it will be difficult for me to just drop it and move on. Part of me wants to try and message her (which I have never done before to any girl) and I’m not sure if it’s the best option. For some background I don’t technically “know” this girl but I had a class with her last semester and I see her around campus sometimes. She also is friends with me on Instagram (which is where I got her snapchat from). So my question now is, do you think I should give up and move on? Or should I send her a message saying hi even though she hasn’t added me back or ever talked to me before? I’m really struggling with this due to my paranoia and any advice would be appreciated. :)",20Mar2019,1
145,"So, short story. I have had a huge mental breakdown over the past year. I learnt alot about what I am dealing with. And I have also hurt people and my relationship with my boyfriend and our kids. I had no support, nothing. People around me don't understand mental health and it was a huge Burdon for me to do it by myself. However over the past couple months I finally got and getting the help I need. I'm mending relationships I broke and people I hurt. I  have been in the hospital and now doing an outpatient program. The people there are fantastic and they helped me help people around me understand what I'm going through. I finally am starting to feel like myself. I have also come to the realization that I am an alcoholic. It was hard for me to admit it for years. But drinking helped me push my feeling and mental health down were noone could help me. I am finally happy with who I am now becoming. And I just want everyone out there who is suffering from mental health to understand that there will come a day where finally you are happy and free. Because you finally understand and can cope with your mental health. There will be some people who will bring you down. Don't listen to them. Get the help you need, get happy and you will feel so good. :) I haven't felt like this in over three years and it feels fantastic. I know I'm going to have some bad days, but who cares.

She made me realize that I still have some Eating Disorder behaviors left, and she really wants to help me through this. I told her that I used to have anorexia, and when she looked it up she said that I had been assigned to an eating disorder clinic in 2016. I didn’t know about this at all, and I told her. So she asked “how did you recover?” and I said that I one day just decided that it wasn’t worth it anymore, even if it was a struggle. I also told her that my family is the cause of this.

147,"Hi. I'm aware all of this is above reddit's paygrade, but my workplace requires a clearance which includes looking into your mental health. They need to know if you're diagnosed with any disorders and what medication you take.  They can choose not to hire you depending on what they find. They have good reason to do so, as there have been some breakdowns in my stressful workplace that has led to deaths. They check up on you thoroughly every five years. I am already hired, but obviously I cannot trust my workplace to retain me if I go to a therapist. I do not think I am in danger of breaking down and my work is not affected.  


I can no longer enjoy my hobbies or anything. When I was in college, I worked when I wasn't studying and so all my free time was eaten up and I slept the rest of the time. I lived in a tired blur. When I graduated, I found out I have several deficiencies causing me to be exhausted. I still do and am working on them.   


I can't do any of the things I used to enjoy because along the way, I found people being rude and critical of my work. Of course I wouldn't be GREAT at any of my hobbies, as I was a beginner. But as soon as I START doing something, all the criticism comes back and I stop. I don't think anyone traumatized me, they were just being a typical snob. But I cared about my hobbies so their thoughts hurt my feelings. One of my hobbies (programming) led me to the job I have now so I don't think I suck at it so much. One such thing they would say behind my back was ""I can't believe Same\_Comparison got hired at X, they don't deserve it"" or ""Yeah, Same\_Comparison isn't the best to go to help for, but you can ask me"" (even though I was a TA and they weren't - that person did not do well in the course either) and other things of that nature. There were also really hurtful remarks like ""She only got this far because she's a girl"". This is just one example. I've shared other things I've done online and get good and bad feedback, but zero in on the bad feedback.  
  

Now, I just browse social media - because how can I be bad at that? But I feel very dissatisfied with my life. I churn out code that I don't care about for work but I don't work on anything satisfying at home. I don't even read books because I don't think I can read enough books to call it a hobby, even though I used to read whatever back then. I'm very afraid of something and I think I am afraid of being bad at things. But as a result I am taking a backseat on my life. Most days I just eat dinner, go to sleep, then go to work. Yes, I sleep for more than 12 hours a day. I used to think it was my deficiencies, but I prefer sleeping because I feel comfortable in my dreams.  


I do nothing around my SO - whatever our dates are is whatever he wants to do. I am intensely afraid that he will figure out who I really am and leave me. That he'll know that I'm too scared to live my life because of some wussy mental baggage that I choose to carry. I think he already figured it out too, because he realized that I don't seem to do anything for myself when he is around and he is gently encouraging me to pick out things to do that I want for myself.  


I think it's so ridiculous that I am being held back by some comments some people made a long time ago online or in school, but I get so scared that I feel better doing nothing. I don't even hang out with friends anymore because I am afraid they'll see how much of  loser I am. What is wrong with me? How do I fix it?   


I know that I am better off seeing a therapist, but this is the next best thing. ",20Mar2019,2

I have been feeling apathetic for almost two years now and just can't be bothered to do anything. 

I haven't really felt any pleasure or interest in anything, I just want to sit on my phone and it feels impossible to talk about it to people I want to but at the same time I don't want to feel better, it's like I feel apart of my identity is feeling this way and I just cant be bothered anymore. I have been having thoughts like ""what's the point"" and ""why don't I just end it all"" I am in no way suicidal and I don't want to kill myself but I just don't care what happens to me anymore and I think if I don't sort it out I might become suicidal.

I find it hard to keep up a conversation most of the time and spend most of my time out with friends just saying nothing so I just keep thinking things like ""why are these people friends with me if I can't even talk to them"" ""are they taking this friendship to be polite"" and I can't stand it. 

Sometimes I will feel fine, I don't exactly feel happy I feel neutral and I feel I am exaggerating how bad I am feeling and keep telling myself that I'm fine and that other people have it worse than me. Is this normal for a teenager if I've felt like this for two years and it's been getting worse.

I'm not a mental health professional but I am highly educated in medicine and I am a concerned friend. My google searching has led me to believe my friend, A, has HPD and does not know it. What I have read is strikingly similar and is starting to make a lot of sense with what I have seen. So I'm looking for some guidance. A is not happy and anyone close enough can see it. If a friend and I were to try to have a discussion with A from a place of genuine caring and concern, would it be wise to bring HPD up in that conversation? Or is it something people need to figure out themselves? Is it worth having a discussion at all? Even if it's not HPD, A has diagnosed anxiety and depression but I'm concerned there's something deeper at play here based on the repetitive behaviors and life crises that happen every 4-6 weeks.

My new psychiatrist took away the only medication that actually helped me

My regular pcm scripted me 30 Xanax in December I have 12 left that’s how little I use it

I use it to get to my pyschologist as I was a housebound agoraphobic with severe panic disorder and severe GAD

I’ve been making strides I was housebound for 6 months now I can somewhat shop easily within a 1 mile radius from my home

I never take Xanax for exposure therapy 
I don’t have full blown panic attacks anymore so. I don’t take at home either except on rare occasions it calls for it

My psychologist is 2.5 miles away on a freeway I know that it doesn’t seem like much but to me it is 

And they decided to take away the only medication I use to get to her 

It’s like no one cares about my disorder like I can just “buck up “ 

I’m fighting tooth and nail everyday 
I do the CBT therapy I do the exposure therapy
The breathing techniques the mindfulness meditations
I eat healthy I work out 
I do worry journals 
I read all the self help books 


All while taking care of my beautiful baby boy 

But I’m so anxious everyday all day long still 
Nothing is improving that much 

I’ve tried so many meds and I’m still waiting on genesight testing weeks later 

I just can’t take much more 
I can’t keep living like this

    He was evaluated and released 5 days later, prescribed meds and recommended therapy etc., all good things, except he’s not in a place to take care of himself mentally/physically. He hasn’t taken any meds and hasn’t followed any orders.
   A week removed now, he’s back to his psychosis: thinks everyone is out to get him, setting boobie traps around his duplex, talking and acting like it’s 10 years ago (he was involved in gang activity), on and on. 
     We know it’s not (strictly) drugs and alcohol. He was detoxed while detained against his will, yet exhibits the same alarming mental traits.
   His neighbor thinks it’s PTSD: he had a near break in weeks ago which seemed to trigger this mental break. 
     To make a long story short, he’s acting very erratic, has been beat up in his neighborhood numerous times for talking “crazy”.
     I’m at a point where I don’t know what to do mentally, physically, legally, etc. We live in Southern Arizona, for the record. He’s already been taken against his will, evaluated and let out, yet he is still a danger to himself and others. My only thought is to try petition him again but it just feels like Ground Hogs Day.

I'm searching some volunteers for the game, whether it's cowriting or offering advise for the game itself.
If anyone is interested in finding out more, please message me! Thanks a ton!

The shitty thing about depression , how my diet has gone downhill , my motivation to consistently lift and go to the gym. And watching my Physical condition just deteriorate , I'm still healthy and within a normal Physical shape. I'm not overweight. I'm in average condition . But there's something really depressing about watching your body go from above and beyond its normal untrained state and feeling healthier stronger  and par taking in the journey to progress and develop to becoming skinny /fat, unmotivated and  bones even looking smaller. 

It's very depressing to realise how much you stop taking care of yourself and that it can get to  the point where it feels like it doesn't even matter .",20Mar2019,2
