0,"My buddy ive known since I was a kid got super religious a year or two ago and it got to the point where its all he talks about although thats annoying I didn't think anything was wrong. A little while ago he started talking about increasingly crazy things like how lizards run the world and you can only kill them with swords and other crazy conspiracy's.

He then left home without telling anyone to wonder around and hunt lizards with his newly purchased sword mind you its the middle of winter and I live in New York so it was freezing out. So he left home for 3 days well everyone was freaking out looking for him until he finally got stopped because people were calling the police on him because he was walking around with a sword going in churches and shit and probably questioning people. So the police finally got him and brought him to the psych ward where he was for less then a week then he escaped from the facility and was missing for another 36 hours until he was recaptured and was held there for a month until he was released .

Well he was there they told him he was schizophrenic and gave him shots of anti psychotics without his consent. I dont think he is schizo because he dosent see shit or hear voices that aren't there he just believes all this crazy shit because of youtube videos and alex jones. Whats wrong with him or is he actually just schizophrenic? ",28Feb2019,0

Listen, i can tell you that im not a perfect human being, but at most i just have mild anxiety and social anxiety. I've been learning to live comfortably with it but it happens at my home at my college. i feel like no human being should have to live through this. its made me grow cold as a human being. I no longer want to partake in social occasions or get involved with people in general. It used to make me depressed, but ive learned to be happy on my own.

9,"Hope I'm not wasting anyone's time that could be spent on someone with a worse situation, but I just wanted to get this out. I have a history of mental problems going back to practically the third grade, just for some background.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like every day my mental health goes farther down the gutter and I'm verging on a total breakdown.

First, I hate having to exist. It's unlikely I'll actually commit, first of all, but I think about suicide maybe 5-6 times every day. Not the act of killing myself, or some mental soap opera episode of my whole family weeping all over me and fantasizing that they care, but literally the idea of nothing. Just going to sleep and never waking up. Phasing out of existence, kind of. Sleeping forever. Never being born in the first place. All the same thing. I'm practically infatuated with the idea.

Similarly, I also wish that I could abandon my life track. Like, go live in Tibet as a monk away from society, go live in the rocky mountains or Siberian woods hunting as one of those mountain people, etc. I'm on the path to go to college, get a job, and probably live out the rest of my life overworked and underpaid and suicidal just like I am now. I try my ass off and do well in school, but sometimes I wonder why I work so hard in the first place. Feels like it's all for nothing.

I'm also really, really badly social traumatized. Last year, an often dramatic girl at my school falsely accused me of ""raping"" her. When I went to the school office about it, and they brought her in, she denied ever saying anything, and said I didn't rape her. Turns out that this was all orchestrated by another girl I thought was my ""friend"" who would help me with going to the school so that she could have leverage to manipulate me into doing things for her. I won't go into that. Needless to say I cut these people off. Anyways, because of this incident, I'm terrified of being direct with girls about how I feel. Before this incident, I had maybe 4-5 girlfriends, and more meaningless sex in-between that. Now, I flirt like hell, and it's often reciprocated, but for the life of me I can't work up the ability to actually be honest with anyone because I'm subconsciously terrified something like this would happen again. I ignore people out of paranoia in the hallways, I'm nice but really abrasive, and I find my voice faltering(really unusual for me) when I say hi afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

I know all teenagers go through stupid shit, and maybe it's just my hormones, but I've had on and off suicidal thoughts since I was 9 so I feel like there's something much worse under the surface.

Anyways, please help me. Tell me what I need to do. I can't imagine doing it today, but I'm scared that one of these days I might snap and really end it all for good.

10,"Im so tired, I feel like I'm repeating the same day over and over, the same routine, same feelings, same everything. Im so tired of it, I don't feel alive or happy anymore, I constantly feel drained and like if I'm waiting and waiting for me to feel happy again. I do work and currently go to school. I used to love school and get excited about it and I wouldn't mind working every weekend but now I'm no longer motivated to go to school let alone be excited like I once used to. I still maintain my grades because I know the importance of having a good GPA. As for work, I find myself getting more and more frustrated and I began to hate my job.

&amp;#x200B;

**Long Version:** So about 3 years ago my wife was diagnosed Bipolar 2 and I won't go into specifics but I almost lost her. It was really bad for a while there. At the worst of it she had a manic episode and didn't sleep for so long that she had to be hospitalized. Through all of this I had no idea what was going on or how to help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an app designer and I've been doing that for a while and so after everything calmed down I decided I wanted to do something about all this the only way that I know how. So I've hitched up with a couple of startup guys (I don't know nearly enough coding.) And I've been working on something for about 4 months it's still in it's infancy but I wanted to get some feedback on it and in general what people thought about this kind of thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't post the app or anything like that because I feel like that comes off scammy but I really just want to get a wider audience and some feedback because while I live with someone who deals with some serious mental health issues every day I don't myself and I want to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid. So if you're willing to talk/want to help please hit me up.

To be fair this is also kind of my celebratory post of the fact that she's now doing a lot better and we're now close to a year without a real episode. Mostly due to her own hard work but I like to think I helped. ",28Feb2019,35

15,"This is a general summary of my experience of a 9 day stay at a Texas Health mental hospital in the Adolescent unit. If you have any further questions please DM me. The mental hospital I went to is pretty low key. It's in of the highway in a community. Here is my background: I find really creative ways to destroy myself.. I have over 100 hours of make-up time in my school, I'm probably not going to pass without or even with summer school. I make myself throw up, almost destroy my skin, even once I made myself act loopy to go to the hospital instead of school. Why you may ask? I don't know. But now that you know this, I was admitted for suicidal ideations and self harm. I stayed in a room with one other guy, and we had 4 groups a day. A recreational activity group, a process group, and a suicide/self harm group. Always, everyday. Sometimes we would have nutritional groups, drug abuse groups, and stuff of the sort. The food was actually pretty good. They had unhealthy options though. Chicken Strips and French Fries were at lunch everyday. Red Velvet cake and all of that really unhealthy shit. But, it made the stay easier on me I found. They took everyone's vitals about 6 times a day, and it was annoying at times. I find that this made me stronger, but it didn't really help me all that much. I feel that what I learned in the mental hospital was stuff I already knew, and stuff that was self explanatory and not something you needed to stay there for. I find the best thing about this place was the people. Connecting with other people really makes you feel welcomed. Hope this helped. Please DM Me.",28Feb2019,3
16,"So I’ve dealt with depression on and off for years. This past year though it’s stayed pretty steady or has only seemed to get worse lately. I’ve noticed that sometimes I just get in these darker moods and I either become snappy, over emotional or blank. Unfortunately my partner is the one who sees all those sides and he tends to get the crappy end of the stick when I become snappy. I find myself getting irritated towards him for some of the stupidest things and it shows on my face a lot. I’ll give dirty looks without even realizing how bad I’m reacting to menial things. The dirty looks SHOULD NOT be directed at him and I’m feeling terrible about the way I can be sometimes when I get in that headspace. I’m trying to figure out counselling to talk through a lot of traumas I have went through in my life. It’s hard to work myself up to actually making the appointment though. And I feel awful because my partner is so good to me and when I’m in good moods or doing better I am good to him but I know I can be better and treat him better so he’s not randomly dealing with all of my terrible moods. Is there anything people have done when they feel themselves getting irritated or mad about silly things? I want to learn how to calm myself enough when I feel those moods coming on so I’m not overreacting to everything. When I’m not dealing with depression I am usually a kind, caring person.

17,"During the past 6 months of my life I went in to a very deep rabbit hole. My depression and anxiety got worst and I felt like the world was caving in on me. And to make matters even scarier, I changed so much that I eventually started manipulating the love of my life..... they became tired of me not listening to their warnings. As much as they told me to look back and see all the damage I was causing I didn’t. Eventually my path of self destruction resulted in me trusting the wrong people and they took advantage of me. They lied and blamed me for raping somebody who I stupidly cheated on my fiancée with. I was labeled as a monster even tho I am innocent and I couldn’t take it anymore and attempted to commit suicide in anyway possible...... my fiancée eventually came back and told me that she knew I was Innocent but the reason she left was because of all the manipulation, pain and suffering. I can’t bear to know that I am going to lose her. I most likely lost my chance but I’m gonna prove to her that I love her and that I can change. She doesn’t tell if I have a possible chance but tells me that she hopes that’s how it’ll go.

19,"Hey gang, so I’m in a bit of conundrum here. For a couple of weeks now, I’ve been feeling some depression symptoms

For some background, I’ve had depression, anxiety, and some DPDR diagnosed in late high school. I got into a relationship, chased the girl to another college, and got to suffer through 4 years of abuse thanks to her. Decided to try to drink all the pain away, which was a terrible idea, but I turned out ok. I got some meds after, and after slowly getting that dosage dialed in, I was a damn happy boy. I even ended up somehow landing the intro to my dream job, and I work freelance on TV, movies, and mostly commercials

My job is pretty intense, like 12+ hour days of intense physical labor. Waking up anywhere between 3AM-8AM and doing odd things throughout the long day with lots of lifting and running and random things. I absolutely adore what I do and feel incredibly blessed to have as much work as I do. But I’d be lying if I said it was all daisies.  I work almost 24/7, leaving no time to see friends, have a drink, relax, take care of things, or really do much besides eat and sleep. I’ll forgo sleeping sometimes just to see people or hangout. It sucks the next day, but coffee usually gets me through!

But as of recent, I’ve been feeling particularly bad. I have no motivation to do even the simplest of tasks, from cleaning my place to picking up something that fell off a counter. I’m constantly tired, can’t think, can’t seem to keep any social interactions going because texting has become too difficult now too, I’ve had nightmares, and my mind is so foggy that I can’t remember if there was anything else I was supposed to add

My friends thing I’m burned out from too much work. All work and no play sort of thing. But even on my days off, I’ve still felt unmotivated and awful. I spent a lot of my off days entertaining others, but even when I wasn’t, I couldn’t bring myself to do any of the tasks I wanted. Just wanted to sit and play games, but even that barely brought me much joy, mostly just left me feeling like a failure. On top of that, I seem to always want to drink or to smoke. Hoping that that’ll help me derive more joy from being able to relax, or whatever it is I’m doing. I’ve never been good at relaxing. I forgot to take my pills for two days in a row, but that was a week ago and I’ve been doing my normal regiment since

I’ve had issues, sure. Arguments and such with people I care about, like with a friend of mine who has become a FWB and now doesn’t wanna talk much, or things going wrong, but nothing that should have made me fall to pieces as far as I know. Yet, doing anything has become a chore and I’m not even excited to work, more dreading having to wake up and be responsible

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice, or just needing to vent. But venting is nice at the very least. If there’s any other info that’ll help, I can provide that too. And on top of that, if anybody has any advice for me to get out of this funk so I can feel functioning and gung-ho again, that would make me one happy lad

24,"So I read that these are symptoms of psychosis, as well as DPDR

- A worrisome drop in grades or job performance
- Trouble thinking clearly or concentrating
- Suspiciousness or uneasiness with others
- A decline in self-care or personal hygiene
- Spending a lot more time alone than usual
- Strong, inappropriate emotions or having no feelings at all

I have all of those symptoms except for decline in hygiene and suspiciousness of others. For the past month or so I’ve simply believed that it was DPDR, but now I’m worried that it might be psychosis. 

I haven’t had any type of hallucinations thankfully. I’m just afraid I might have developed psychosis after having a bad LSD trip.

Are there symptoms that you constantly have if you have psychosis?

Can you have psychosis but with no delusions?

Now this story isnt all that great at all and it wont ever be publishable but thats not the problem that i have.

Two years ago when i started writing the story i had two boys visualized in my mind.

Fast foward to August of 2018 and i found myself in a my old state in a new school and there are two boys that resemble the boys from my story so hard that its scary.

Im trying to convince myself that its not real but i dont know what to make of it. I dont know if me moving was traumatic enough for this to be a coping mechanism but its the only thing that makes sense.

Maybe my brain was so traumatized by the move that it wanted some kind of connection to somebody else and these boys just happemed to be the culprits.

I dont talk to them but everytime i encounter them (because they're always together) my body locks up for a minute and i can feel every cell in my body just wanting to jump out and just wrap my arms around them.

28,"Lately I’ve been reading a lot about burnout, and specially how its affecting people in my field of work (filmmaking). In the last couple of months I’m feeling “off”. It doesn’t matter how much I sleep, I never feel my usual self, I’d say that most of the days I’m operating on 60% of my energy, 70/75% in the best days. I can’t fully enjoy stuff that I usually like. I can’t watch anything longer than a 10 minute YouTube video, if I try to see a tv show I get restless the entire time thinking about work, and I avoid movies all together because I feel guilty for the time spent watching. I don’t usually forget things and stuff in places, because this used to be a issue when I was younger and I became hyper-aware about this to avoid problems. But lately several little things are happening that are very out of place to me, and its  bothering me very much. To illustrate, yesterday in the morning I went to make coffee, I took everything I needed out of the cabinet, and instead of taking a filter of the box and putting in the pot, I immediately opened the cabinet again, stored the filter box and closed the door, only to look back at what I was doing and notice that I didn’t took the filter; I forgot my keys at the keyhole of my apartment door when I went out earlier this week; I am constantly forgetting words that I want to use in the middle of a conversation and having these random blanks that my brains just freezes in the middle of less serious tasks, among other situations. These things only happens when I’m not doing work related stuff, but I’m concerned that with time these behaviors start to creep into my work and evolve to something more serious. What really raised my concern about this situation was something that happened today. I was already very bummed that my boss contacted me last minute yesterday, and I will have to travel for work tomorrow and be out of town the entire week, consequently missing an entire holiday week and the carnaval (I’m from Brasil, yay), something that I was looking forward to enjoy. I had a very stressful day fixing some fuck ups that the guy that works with me made, when a girl that i like messages me and ask if we can chat over the phone. And here is the thing: normally I’m very good talking to people. I’m very sociable, I can talk about all kinds of stuff and I will try to crack jokes all the time. And although I was very excited to talk to her and we spent more than an hour over the phone, she did most of the talking. I felt that I was very reticent and distracted with my problems, to the point that i started to get self-aware about and i started to feel a little anxious. The blanks popped too. It was a downer, because talking to people is something that I love, it’s something natural and that I feel comfortable doing. I was disappointed with myself. I was eager to talk to her, we have so much in common and I felt that we “clicked” before. Now I’m even worried that I caused a bad impression on her. 
I don’t know if this has something to do with the changes I made in my work routine last year. I used to be very undisciplined with my schedule, and I started to put everything work related in calendars, to-do lists and monitoring my activity with rescue time. I struggled a long time with self-discipline in the past, working as a freelancer. After these methods worked very well for me, I became a bit obsessed with being productive. I’ve been having amazing results so far, but will be a huge let down if these problems follows as collateral.
These are symptoms of burnout or I’m just dwelling too much and making a big deal? Or should I be concerned and maybe seek some kind of therapy or a medical opinion?

31,"Ever since I was little, my emotions were very flat compared to others. I didn't really notice something was wrong untill I really started thinking about it. I once went over to my cousins house and saw a hole in her wall, she told me she had punched it because she was angry. I could never imagine doing that, the inconvenience of hurting myself seemed so much more previlant than releasing such a strong sense of emotion. Emotion that I would slowly learn from then on that I didn't really have. The more I noticed that I never found anyone attractive, I didn't really enjoy anything, nothing gave me satisfaction or emotional rewards, etc. I have impulsive thoughts and physical reactions, but nothing internal. I feel very flat and dull.

I just didn't really feel anything, and I omly became more and more apathetic as the years went on. I'm not angry, I'm not happy, I'm not suicidal because I don't get sad. My days are just my work and my room, and when I try to go out and interact with others I only feel more out of place and ""fake"".
In highschool I managed to bypass my apathy somewhat and thanks to a crisis was ablw to force myself to seek out outside help. Not too long after I was diagnosed with depression and was on meds for a year but nothing changed. I stopped going because it felt inconvenient and like a waste of time. I wasn't happy, so there was no point. I weened myself off the meds once I ran out and that was about 4 months ago...

I'm 19, and I've been out of highschool for 2 years now, My family is getting on me about going to school and doing something with my life but I don't know what to do. Sure I'm ""good at things"" but nothing appeals to me, nothing matters enough to pursue it, and I sense that the second I try too, I'll only drop it for convenience sake. I never thought about my future because I wasn't ever able to see it. I had always assumed I'd somehow be dead by now. And I sort of feel like I am.

My grandma says I'm getting comfortable, but I honestly believe even on the streets I wouldn't try to help myself. I just don't care enough. As it stands, I sleep alot and don't exercise or feed myself all that much. I know I'm depressed but it feels liks so much more than that. I've been like this for as long as I can remember, and I don't know if this is all life has in store for me. 
I guess I just want to hear thoughts from others. Thank you for your time.",28Feb2019,1
32,"In short absolute crap 

I got there at night I was taken to a room and into it's bathroom (a person 5:4 and up can easily see above due to large slant the bottom of the door is public stall height) I was told to take off all my clothes by a male nurse he inspected all my clothes (14 year old female at the time) and confiscated my bra he had me put on scrubs to make sure I didn't have anything on me then let me change and left

The bed felt like a brick and I was freezing all night when I woke up someone was turning my lights on and screaming ""ROOM CHECK"" opening every drawer and said I needed to already be up

Everyday for every meal because of my taste texture and smell food aversions I only had 9 bread rolls a day 2 of the 10 days I was there I got 6

They forced me to do RT (PE) every day I was 5:4 and was 110 pounds when I went in and lost 10 pounds in days 10 days (18.9 low normal BMI to 17.2 underweight BMI) one nurse also forcefully grabbed a roll off my plate once slammed it on the counter and shouted ""two servings!"" At me 

The only thing it said on my case file for there was stuff about sexting men getting my phone taken away and then cutting not the rest of was raped and beaten repeatedly age two depressed anxiety etc so some nurses treated me like a spoiled little brat who gets whatever she wants and self harms when mommy and daddy takes her phone away

There was a 'school' there not a real school not a real teacher no teaching school nothing just a nurse I also have a quite a bit of IEP I'm a few grades behind in math particularly so when this 'teacher' asked me what grade I was I told her she gave me math a few grades up then the stuff I was doing in IDVA (online school) and got upset that I didn't know how to do it and didn't teach me how to finish them

They also forced me to say things I didn't want to to other paitents i didnt know like if I don't share why I'm there I will never leave type of thing but no one pulled me aside and said what I should say

I was put in the boys hall as well and was constantly forgotten

There was also this thing the wake up call who came a few minutes before room check would flip on all the lights well the night light was a fucking piece of the sun and I have light sensitivity  it hurt to look at it and it was the first thing you had to look at when you got up my in patient therapist told me to tell the lady to turn the night light off and she just said no so I didn't get up then 3 HOURS LATER a nurse comes in to give me my meds I ask to crying to please turn off the night light she turns all lights off but that light I repeat my self and ""no! I need that light to see!!! IF YOU WONT TAKE YOUR MEDS YOULL JUST HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR THERIPIST!!!"" My theripist turned off the light before even coming in

36,"Okay so, I still feel very scatter-brained so I'm sorry if this doesn't come across that clear but I'm just hoping for some input.

I've thought for quite a while that I might have ADHD?? Maybe? It's hard to say because I haven't been able to see a professional and everyone tells me the whole world thinks they have it so maybe I'm fooling myself but I have really bad issues with inattention and... functioning. As a productive human. Also both my parents have it. But that's mostly besides the point.

I have this issue pretty frequently where I'll be in the middle of doing something and my brain will just sort of shut off, and it feels like i'm almost being smoke-screened out of the real world. I can kinda keep doing stuff but I'm not really.... there? I guess? It's a super weird feeling and I more or less have a really hard time processing stuff that's going on around me. I usually just sorta go on autopilot and uncomfortably wait it out. Sometimes I'm aware that it's happening and other times it just happens. I've had a few people tell me I might be disassociating but I'm honestly not really sure, especially because even though I didn't have a great childhood I don't have any trauma and everyone who's talked to me about dissociating has said it stems from trauma so I'm unsure.

Anyways, I usually experience this kind of thing when I'm by myself, trying to complete some sort of task, I'd say. Every once in a while it'll happen in a social setting and I can sorta scrape by on my less socially-inclined autopilot alter ego until I can remove myself from the situation. However, something happened today that's really been bothering me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was talking to my best friend over the phone and he was sorta bummed about something and we had been calling for a while and without noticing at first, I realized that at some point that I was really out of it for no discernible reason. His being bummed turned into being really sad and I of course wanted to be a good friend, to talk to him and be there for him, but I found myself just... completely unable to think or process anything at all. It was kind of startling how foggy I felt and I could tell I sounded dumb as hell, but there was nothing I could do about it. Words were coming out of my mouth at a snail's pace and I didn't even know what I was saying half of the time or if I was making sense. He'd say a normal sentence like a normal person and I'd reply with something along the lines of ""Um......... yeah.......... I...... uh............... I......... uh....................."" 

I eventually worked up the vocabulary to excuse myself but I felt really horrible about leaving someone I cared a lot about in the dust like that. And like, I know I mentioned I've felt similarly before but it was never this intense. If I had to describe it I'd say it was like the real me got replaced with some random person, that person was given a script to play the role of real me, and shoved onto live tv and forced to act in the moment even though they had no idea what was going on and had definitely never been to acting school- all while I watched helplessly and face-palmed.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is a broad ""I'm confused please help.""

I don't really have anyone to talk to about this kind of thing so I think I just need some insight right now, problems like this keep cropping up and i don't know what to do about it.

37,"Hey guys! Thought I would come here for some advice before I take the next step. 

Bit of backstory, I am a male, 20years old. Over the past few months/year, I have noticed that nearly every day I seem to have an emotional blackout. I can be having an amazing day and in a great mood and suddenly I can feel nothing and get extremely agitated with seemingly no trigger. 

When I say emotional blackout, I tend to just space out, lose any feelings whatsoever, and kind of just blank out. Honestly, feels like I’m numb to the world around me and mentally drift.  I never really noticed it happening until my girlfriend brought it up to me recently, hence not knowing an exact timeline. Maybe it’s been happening for years and I’m just finally coming to realize what is happening to me? For a while back in high school my parents and teachers would bring up how my moods would shift on a whim. 

A few summers back I was hospitalized for viral encephalitis (swelling of the brain) leading to a fairly serious seizure and about four days I don’t remember/was incoherent for. 

I’m wondering if what I’m feeling now is just delayed effects from my brain being screwed up from then, or could my feeling be red flags for a possible onset mental health problems?

TLDR: my emotions switch off for no reason almost daily, need help figuring out why

38,"Had a great therapy session today, and it got a lot more emotional than expected. 

Synopsis: I take what others say/think to heart, probably too much. And especially too much with negative/bullies (My boss, coworkers, mom, etc).

My therapist said as far as he can see I'm a normal person. I make mistakes, am not perfect, try really hard, and do a good amount of good. I try and improve, I struggle, I get back up again. So by all accounts we could pretend what my life and view on myself would be like if we hadn't had these bullies and abusers come into my life and wipe just little smears of shit over my glasses. I could see the reasonable, if not good, things I do if it weren't for their shit smearing my view. If it weren't for them, and whatever their reasons are for why they smear shit on others, I could see myself clearly. 

So my homework was to try taking off my 'glasses' some times. Try remembering the shit isn't mine or because of me, and I can separate myself from it.  ",28Feb2019,3
39,"I’ve dealt with mental issues since I was 15. First it was social anxiety, then OCD, the depression. I received treatment and cured my social anxiety and ocd, and my depression was fairly manageable. 

But then at 19, I developed thought disorder and my depression became extremely severe. I’m almost 21 now. I’ve tried so many medications I can’t even remember all of them. They haven’t done anything. I can’t cope with this, my mind feels damaged. I can’t think without the thoughts in my head consistently pausing or sounding garbled. It drives me mad. I need this to stop, I’m hanging by a very thin thread. I would much rather die than live this way. 

I have no idea what to do. Do I go to the psych ward and beg for help? I’ve been there twice in the past year, they didn’t do anything useful. They just keep prescribing different pills that I know for a fact won’t do shit. I’m against meds now, they don’t work for me.

I have had bad experiences in the past because I was forced into therapy as a younger person due to drug use and bad behavior as a minor.

I am struggling with a lot in my life right now and it's causing me to be very distracted in school. I'm having constant suicidal thoughts and my anxiety has gotten alot worse. I have so many bundled up emotions that it's causing me to have breakdowns in school. I have to ask to go to the bathroom and I'll sit in there for 10-20 minutes trying to get myself back together so I can continue on with my day.

I have become extremely introverted and have lost a decent amount of the smaller friend group that I have. People will constantly make fun of me because I am ""The Fatass"". They have just completely stopped listening and paying attention to me. And if they do say something to me they tell me to go away or they start laughing at me.

At home I have to deal with a whole plethora of issues too. My dad Is verbally/mentally abusive and sometimes physically abusive. My mom has mental issues of her own too. She was in a mental hospital for a week and a half near the end of the year.

In the middle of the year my dad was on a long stretch of not working. During this time he abused me and my mother. He punched me several times, choked out my mother then took a whole bottle of anti-depressants in an attempt to kill himself in front of me, my little sister, and my mom.

He was kicked out of the house and he lived with my half-brother for a month. He promised that this would never happen again and my mother brought him back into our lives. 

Two days ago we got into a argument and he attempted to assault me. He then blamed all of this on my mom who did nothing wrong.

I honestly am disgusted by him. I can't be around him and I can't talk to him. He demands respect when he doesn't deserve any. Is it wrong to hate him?

All of these emotions im feeling and all the things I can't talk to anybody about are overwhelming. I'm constantly depressed and angry and sometimes I don't even know what to feel.

I'm not sure who to go too or what to do. I had a counselor at school but she just completely stopped calling me in to meet with her. My family doesn't have enough money to go to a therapist, so that's almost completely out of the picture.

I don't know what to do and I need advice.

44,"Hey everyone, I'm hopin this is the right sub to post.  


I guess I'll start with who I am and my history. I'm 18, male, and my name is Noah. I've dealt with various mental issues for years now that had started to die down. But they started acting up again. I was severely sexually and mentally abused for years, starting when I was around 8 or 9. When I got taken out of the school where the abuse had taken place, I was stuck in a rocking position on my couch for about six months straight. No talking, no movement, no signs of mental cognitivity (if that's the word) besides eating and light grunts. Anyways, after 6 months of this I finally started to break out of my trance as if my mind had started to rebuild itself. I got sent to a small middle school around year 7 to try and rebuild my social skills, to no avail. I was changing who I was, what I liked, who I liked, basically a complete personality change every week or so. It was exhausting. I started to have these thoughts. Full of death, agony, and torture. They invaded my every thought. Every time I saw someone I would think of the most gruesome ways I could end their life. Every time I would enter a new room, I would see new items and get flooded with ways of killing my peers with said item. Soon the thoughts grew into urges, then the urges started to take over. I would come literally inches away from stabbing some kid with a pair of scissors many times. I told my parents about these thoughts and they said it was ""hormones"" and that I needed to pray them away. I graduated from middle school and my issues only got worse. I became extremely impulsive sexually, drug usage, and violence wise. I started lying about everything about me, telling various grand tales about my past and what I could do. I would manipulate people so easy, fabricating drama between people just to watch shit burn. I'd build up someones trust in me, then let it all fucking crash. Eventually my ""personality's"" morphed into the voices in my head. I have three; my neutral state, which reassures me that I'm mentally fine. My depressive one which tells me everything wrong with me and makes me harp on them. And the one that says hes a demon and fills my head with the violence. They take over a lot, but mainly just fight in my head. Sometimes both the depression and anger side breakout and have full conversations. My roommate has walked in before to them both talking at each other through my mouth, obviously freaking him out. In the past 2 years though, shit has take a turn for the worst, I started wanting to actually kill. Not just a slight want, but a need. I used to be scared of these thoughts and fight them, saying that its not me. But maybe it is me, maybe im supposed to kill. I started cutting myself, burning myself, spending nights alone in my dark room meditating on the violent thoughts and talking to myself. I have murder dreams all the time now. My roommate woke up to me asleep in my bed with my eyes open repeating ""I could do it. I could kill him right now.""  
I also deal with sexual anhedonia and I have sadistic personality disorder, obviously making a killer cocktail.   
I'm highly considering institutionalizing myself again.

I was asking about seeing a doctor because I would go in and out of these thoughts and when I would burn out and calm down, I would think that it is not bad enough to take up a doctors time. I was thinking about a doctor to call after I made the post but I am honestly resisting because of moments of embarrassment. Since the post, my family has started to notice something is wrong, so it is getting worse and more frequent. I don't tell them anything, they just think it is some money/career depression I
m very sure. I really need to get some out here a little more. My mom tried to call somewhere for me without me knowing and making me go, but I am 22 so I need to call myself. She told me to call and go and that family can pay for one visit. I finally called recently but I have to wait 3 weeks just to set up an appointment. I don't know where to go from here. The over analyzing of these worlds is getting to much and it is every hour of everyday. This past Sunday, a realization of death came back that I had to get through during the first half of 2017, but I think every has had this. Having doubts about the reality of these shows brought on a major sense of reality. This time feels different. I have paniced about it like I did before since this past Sunday, but now, I don't know why, the panic about if I can get there is to scary to think about. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I would try not to cry about everything in these shows. I had problems like this around Christmas for a bit too. I remember at work, I got put on a mindless repeatitive job for the night. I started daydreaming about living up in the arctic but with some of the animated characters there with me. This was increidibly vivid for a little while and when I came back, it was almost impossible not to cry. Even now, remembering, I want to cry. The past 4 days have been that but worse. I have very serious thoughts about being insignificant and all my thoughts and feelings that I unknowingly believed to be my world might not have any meaning.  I am deliberatly imagining possiblities of living in towns from the shows to escape the idea of dying and loosing all the happiness I get from the worlds. 2 big thoughts bother me, realizing getting to meet them is impossible, and that if I die, could all the feelings could go away. Could I even see them anymore after I die? Where are the places I dream about? If I can see something and imagine it, it has to exist somewhere. It is like a nightmare sometimes jsut walking around a store. I will see a character drawn on something, and think of them as nothing but a drawing. I cant help but cry and reassure myself that they are not. This world in the past few weeks has been so bad that I feel like this is the bad dream I'm having and I can wake up there and and just take a deep breath. Like when you wake up from a depressing dream and are just happy that isnt your life. I have thought about vivid interactions within the shows but it is so hard to get those little bursts of bliss and relief. I believe they are real and I get my happiness. I would trade all competition, career and success in this world to just be a ""nobody"" there. I have considered reality here to line up with the reality there. Like, if the universe is hologram like some scientists have said, than so be it. Whatever that is is reality and we know it, it doesn't change anything. If it was, than there is a chance I could have the heaven that I want. I thought about this recently. I have dilibratly looked at an object and touched it just to try to imagine what is making me see it this way. Today, I am burnt out from thinking and crying. I think I have cried on almost every drive I've done since Sunday. I have been on kind of a high since then. My days are very long with college and work and I just haven't cared about them anymore. I always did all work and studying, with no procrastination, but now I barely get work done before it is due. I hate school and don't want a future here with any job. Every minute out in this world is unbearable. Periods of getting lost in daydreams are the only way to stop extreme dread. I had a recent memory of imagining staying at one of the characters houses for a few seconds. I can't remember when or where I thought this today, but I think it was a few minutes of bliss. They are very strong now but tonight, I don't know what else to think. I can't sleep but there is the same long day tomorrow. ",28Feb2019,2

In the beginning, I was so severely depressed there was no question that I needed to be on meds. I was suicidal and harming myself.

Then I'd start to feel bad again and go back on them.

It's like every time my depression goes away, I think it's gone or cured. I think, maybe it wasn't that serious, even though I was borderline delusional and out of control of my thoughts and actions.

And this caused our friends circle to break and now I'm practically a stranger to them. The people I grew up with.

61,"I'm 33. You'd think I'd have my shit together. You'd think I'd be happy with my hub and my kid. But I'm not.

I've had so much shit happen in my life. Mental abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, spiritual abuse. Had a brother die when I was 11, then my sister committed suicide right after I graduated high school, throwing my life completely out of whack. Then I thrust myself into the religion I grew up in because I kept being told it would give me solace and peace, but instead it ruined 12 years of my life. 

I have nothing but regrets... Broken dreams... No hope.

I wanted to be an artist. I've thought about going back to school, but now that I'm in my 30s it feels like a stupid dream. Do people even do that? Go back to school when they're broke ass poor and have a kid? Seems like a waste of time, but because I always did ""what I was supposed to do"" instead of what I wanted to do I can't help fantasizing what my life could have been. What I wish it was.

62,"Ok so, I (now 20f) originally drafted this a few months back. Wasn't going to post it at first, but a doctor brought up something about me possibly being bipolar and looking back I'm wondering if a manic episode could be to blame for all of this? **NOT looking to self-diagnose**, but I'm just wondering if getting checked out by an actual psychologist would be a good idea, based on these things? Like is this enough of a cause for concern or could I just be acting out due to life stressors?   
Also, I am majoring in psychology and currently taking an abnormal psych class. I am kind of afraid to analyze my own behaviors in the same way we analyze them in class, because I definitely do not want to diagnose myself or project some of the symptoms that I know are related to bipolar disorder onto my own symptoms here. I am afraid that if I do go to the doctor about this, the information I already know about bipolar disorder may cloud my thoughts and might make my thinking and explanation of what I experience a bit biased, if that makes sense? Who knows, but I've been feeling very hyperactive, everything is blurry, and it kind of feels like I'm not entirely real. This is how I started to feel before all the following shit happened, and so if there's more to come from this I'm starting to get worried.   
I think it's also important to note that a few nights before I went out drinking with my work buddies and had an amazing night, I was 200% certain I wanted to kill myself and was mere seconds away from doing it. I ended up drinking and smoking myself to sleep before I could do it, but I wrote a suicide note and had a plan and everything.   
BASICALLY my question here is, could this be normal or should I get help?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19f and this is mostly just to sort my thoughts. Any input, advice, or support is always nice!I'm trying to process all the things I've done in the past few weeks and it's sort of concerning me. It almost feels like I was a different person entirely for a few days. There were many things that I did and decisions I made that at the time I was 100% on board with and committed to and now I look back on those, cringe, and even feel ashamed of it. While some of these do seem to fit with my personality and things I might've done anyway, some of these are severely out of character and it's scary how I'm adamantly against some of the things that I thought were great ideas. I've tried to compile a short list of some of the more notable things I've done in the past few months to now:

* Went out drinking with these two guys I work with and have continued to do so every so often. One is ten years older than me and the other is my age. Ended up becoming pretty good friends with them and being on good terms with them has helped me have more of a social life at work. The only bad thing is that sometimes they seem like bad influences. Hanging out with them often includes at least one person driving under the influence of some alcohol.
* On two separate occasions, yelled at ""customers"" who were stealing from our store. In both cases I followed them out to the parking lot screaming and fighting with them. One on those times I was on the clock, the second time I was out drinking with my buddies and we decided to stop at our workplace to use the bathroom (solid logic obviously). I've always been quiet and kept to myself at work but I've slowly become more vocal and outgoing.
* My friendliness and ability to be talkative continued to grow. On a few different occasions I can remember talking to a coworker or customer and just going on and going, talking really fast and rushed. I think I sounded confusing because they always seemed confused and didn't know quite what to say in response.
* Went on a random ""date"" with a guy from tinder, thought it was chill, but for some reason he blocked me from almost everything afterwards.
* A coworker from a different department hit me up and randomly asked if I wanted to go out one night. I thought ""fuck it"" and decided to go on a whim. We ended up hooking up, though that was not my plan at all, even though I was still barely ""seeing"" my abusive ex. (takes a loooong time to get rid of parasites, my friends).
* Few weeks later a long time family friend and I spontaneously decided to skip our class and instead we went to a park and hooked up.
* My ex started talking about getting back together and he seemed really excited about it. Suddenly I got the news that I tested positive for a (curable) STD. Told my coworker, friend, and ex that they should get tested.
   * Coworker said he tested negative but he got the results really fast so I'm worried he just lied to get me off his back.
   * Friend tested negative.
   * Ex tested positive, but that was also after he was having sex with me.
* Felt like my coworker was lying to me, texted him to ask for proof, he just sent laughing emojis and said I was lucky he even shared his results with me. Then he blocked me and I resorted to glaring him down at work for a few days in a really threatening, aggressive, and honestly inappropriate way. That was really unlike me but I just felt so angry. Now I feel like he's dead to me and just make sure not to stop by his department while he's working.
* Still not sure who I actually got the std from but I think it was probably my ex. I used protection with everyone except him. (I know, I know). That whole thing ruined any chance of us getting back together and I haven't heard from him for weeks until today, when he randomly brought me coffee but still didn't want to talk. What's that called? Breadcrumbing?
* Started smoking/vaping weed a *looooot* more as a way to deal with the pain healing from the std caused as well as dealing with the whole situation with my ex. On a few occasions I've been high all day, just hitting my wax pen every time I start to come down. Has changed my mindset and way of thinking, but I think it's in a good way. I'm worried about causing damage to myself though. Plus it's gotten to the point where I'll literally be telling myself that I'm not gonna smoke today, as I'm lighting a joint or turning on my pen.
* Briefly discovered the whole sugarbaby and findom culture online, indulged in that for awhile, going as far as to make my own domme account on multiple sites to try and drain money out of these men who pay women to bully them online. Dedicated large portions of my time and energy to constantly taking pictures, videos, dressing up in scantily clad lingerie outfits, and doing my makeup in a completely different style than what I usually did, because inch long cat-eyes made me feel sexy. 
* This is unrelated to the above but a guy originally from tinder has been on my snapchat for over a year now and he randomly asked me to be his sugarbaby, basically just asking me to send him pics and vids and he'd pay me for them. He ended up being super cheap about it, but I averaged about $8-10 for a group of pics or a vid. When he offered $25 to have sex with me I knew that was the end of that, but overall I got just over $100 from him.
* Then for the past two weeks...
   * Spontaneously went out drinking with *just* the older (30m) of my two drinking buddies after work.
   * Went out and got high with some long time friends for a few times. Have definitely been more socially active lately.
   * Also randomly stayed after work and smoked in my car with the younger one of the drinking buds.
   * Got high during work.
   * A guy I knew from snapchat randomly invited me over because he was home alone for a weekend. We fooled around and watched Netflix but I was on my period so we didn't have sex. He fell asleep after and I woke him up when I left. I got some friendly chemistry out of it so I tried continuing to talk to him after but he started getting dry. Invited him over once my period was over but cancelled when he didn't read my message for an entire day. He didn't seem bothered at all about it and hasn't hit me up since so that's another guy randomly not talking to me after we met. :/
   * After I left his place that night though, I went over to a small hangout with my family friend (yes, the one I hooked up with). His two guy friends were there too and we all wanted to drink, so my friend and I went to pick up from my older drinking buddy. It was an amazing car ride and I was excessively talkative. Seriously I would not shut up and I wouldn't allow the conversation to get boring. We picked up the older guy to go get beer, I gave him my card and told him to get something for himself too as a thank you, we dropped him off, went back to the pad, and then I drank with complete strangers and ended up having a great time getting to know them.

I have been on Mirtazapine for 4 years now, and on the 45mg dose. I was prescribed it for depression, anxiety and panic attacks. 4 days ago I went to my doctor because I feel as if i’m ready to come off it, I have been in a really good place for the past year emotionally and felt like now is the right time. I also am not in control of my weight with it, I have gained nearly 30kg over the 4 years. I have cut down my dose to half a tablet each night, and am going to a quarter after a week. 

At the moment I emotionally feel fine, not anxious or depressed, but I almost feel like i’m going crazy? I feel so out of it, I am getting headaches and sweating and just feel really confused. When people talk to me it’s taking me longer to process what they’re saying, and I am really forgetful. My brain just feels really scattered.

Has anyone had these sort of experiences coming off of Mirtazapine or just anti depressants in general? Is this relatively typical for day 3? When will I start to feel normal again?

65,"Firstly a bit of context.

&amp;#x200B;

Only  7  weeks ago I was diagnosed with  Mania (Altman) and Depression (QIDS) due to a lapse in my mental health which started to deteriorate 3 weeks prior. With the help of my work and my mother, thank God for her, I have been able to mostly get my mental state back to healthy.  During that time however I did hit a  bit of a low because  my mum suffered an non fatal aneurysm in her brain about 4 weeks ago, which she has been able to fully recover from. This scared my a lot   and still does but I haven't been able to disclose this to her. This lead me to be concerned about my own physical health which I have put of since the age of 13 due to the open heart surgery I had, so I have slowly been getting into shape and it has been going successfully so far.  BTW I am 22 in April and my BMI is 26. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have recently been reducing my calorie count quite drastically and now I have started to skip lunch. My mum noticed this morning and she is scared that I may develop an eating disorder. I have suddenly started to get doubts as well and so I was wondering whether it should be a cause for concern?

71,"I'm not typically and avid Reddit user.  I just figured that some people in this subreddit would know or could possibly relate what I'm going through, so I'll start from the beginning. I have had some issues with anxiety from the past, I have always been a rather social person who enjoys going out. I started smoking weed around the age of 15 on and off. It wasn't until around I was 17 when I started smoking heavily. Around that time I decided that school was more important and enrolled in an extra curricular that required drug testing. For a while I stopped because I wanted to set my priorities straight and prepare myself for a future career. I would always decide to smoke some weed during breaks in high school since I was safe from any drug tests of the sort. Now, I have had some bad ""trips"" if you could call it that, from smoking weed, but this one was very different. It was spring break and I had a care free week ahead of me. My buddy and I decided to smoke to celebrate. After a few hours of smoking I was just feeling a normal high. Eventually, I smoked a little more and that's when things turned for the worst. To this day I cannot explain as to why this happened to me. Some of my friends explained it as an ""ego death"" but I am just not sure. I started to have a very, very bad psychedelic type high. (I can only relate this to a trip because I have only heard second hand experiences of a psychedelic experience.) Everything started melting in the room at first. After that I lost all realization with reality. I was in a weird cosmic loop and that is when panic started to set in. I felt as if I was going to be there forever. Thankfully, my friend was there to snap me out of it and I was able to slowly recollect myself over the next few hours of the night. It was a terrible experience, but for the next few months, it didn't bother me and I was able to smoke here and there with no issues. Many months later, I was laying in bed before the next school day reflecting. I though tot myself ""What if I could trip like that without smoking"" in an almost ironic fashion. All of the sudden it was like a wave of terror ran over me. I could physically feel it rush over me. I was in a state of panic and I somehow felt so disconnected from myself. I tried my best to sleep it off and go to school the next day. At school I had a moment that almost recreated what I went through so long ago. I started to panic and felt ill. I had no idea what was wrong with me but I needed to leave. I was so distraught. When I got home my mom insisted that I had to go to the ER. Afterwards everything checked out completed fine and I had no idea what was wrong with me. I continued to just feel off and on edge basically in any public place I went. I visited many doctors to try to solve my issue, but nothing came up as a red flag. Eventually my girlfriend of a few years, who was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, told me that my symptoms pretty much checked out to anxiety. I felt that this was not the case since I had basically lived a normal life until that very night when everything changed. Eventually things got to overbearing and I swallowed my pride and visited my doctor. She told me that my symptoms checked out. She told me that I did indeed have an anxiety disorder. I was prescribed Lexapro. Even though it was an originally an antidepressant , it turned out to be very helpful for anxiety. My family is in a pretty bad spot as of recently, so we cannot afford to take me to a psychiatrist or a psychologist.  Upon further ""research"" if that's what you want to call it, I have concluded that I am suffering from agoraphobia. I only have these episodes of panic and a disconnection from reality when I realize that I feel vulnerable in public. I often worry about making a scene when I have these episodes, and that just builds up my anxiety up until a point to where I have a panic attack. I know that everyone is different, and this is especially true when it come to anxiety. My girlfriends sister also has an anxiety disorder and has told me that she feels the exact same way. I know this post may seem confusing, but I am just here to try to get a second opinion from others who are maybe sharing the same experience. I will admit, my medicine has done me wonders. I was having a very hard time feeling like myself since that one night. I felt that I was not the same person for the longest time. Now I am able to somewhat regain what I had once lost. Please let me know what you think! ",28Feb2019,2
72,"I am really ashamed while writing this down. I guess I will just start at the beginning. English is not my native language, so excuse me for any mistakes.  


When I was very young, I got sexually abused by my babysitter (neighbor). This ended when I was around 3, and my parents and I moved to another city to start over again. However, I never really got any help with this. We did go to a doctor for a medical check-up, I got to see a child psychologist etc, but all said I would not be affected by it later in life.   
However, I turned out to be a very insecure child, extremely perfectionistic, which turned school for me into an actual hell because I put so much pressure on myself to get good grades.   
Also, I got overweight a bit, which made me insecure even more. When I was around 10, I got diagnosed with OCD.   
By the time I was in high school, I got on medication (prozac), which helped I guess. However, the extreme insecurities kept taking their toll. I now realize I never was quite myself during those times.   


When I went to university, I lost myself. I started dating, quite a lot. I think this was because I have always felt very ugly, and I needed confirmation that I wasnt. However, I never got to learn to set my own boundaries, because I always pushed my boundaries myself as well. This resulted in me doing things I did not want to, like having (unprotected) sex multiple times (I was on the pill). I was very affected by my ocd, and the only way to get a break from it was alcohol, going out, just have distractions. I did things I still cant imagine I did, because now I am extremely scared of getting stds after my experiences. One time, I got so drunk I ended up at a guy's place. I remember they gave me some weed (i think), then it quite went black, but I am sure I ended up in his bed. I remember sort of waking op from my drunkenness, realizing what was going on, but not quite understanding. Then it went black again. The next morning, he told me that I had sex with his roommate as well.   
From there, it went downwards with me. Of course I went to the sexual health clinic because I was completely freaking out about hiv for example. Turned out I got chlamydia from it, which extremely embarrassed me. I felt so bad about myself, and was extremely angry. As for now, I am glad I did not take my life after that, I really could not imagine how my parents would have felt. However, this was not the only occasion. Another time, I literally told a guy 'no',  he said 'yes', and continued. I did not do anything, I just tried to make him finish faster, and afterwards (he already left) I cried and only then I realized he didnt use protection.

I did this stuff more often (drunken sex), which might seem normal to others, but for me it was a complete hell afterwards. I felt completely lost, alone, scared, but did not know how to deal with it. I always learned that sex was something you do not talk about. I never got any education from my parents about it. One time my mother tried, and I literally fainted. I think that, due to my experiences, I was so embarrassed of it that I couldnt handle talking about it.   
As for now, I slowly get my shit together, almost starting therapy for my ocd and fears of getting sick again. My sex/love life is as disfunctional as it can be because I am so scared of infections or infecting other people with all sorts of stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I bettered my life in the past few years , I really do not know how I can forgive myself that this happened. If  I think back to this period, I do not recognize myself at all in this behaviour. Sometimes I am so angry at myself that I want to punish myself, like not eating, not taking care of me, or having repetitive thoughts that I am worthless and disgusting. I truly believe that no one ever will want me as a girlfriend or wife if they figure out what I did. But most importantly, I will never be able to accept myself ever again and not considering myself as dirty.

Hoping you guys have some advice.

I've been on sertraline now for over a year and have also just started long term psycho therapy.

I've  decided to stop taking my meds mainly because I started to feel bad on them despite my dosage being upped and also because I wanted to regain some control over my life ( I don't want to be taking a pill to fix me forever).

It's been 2 weeks and I think it's going ok. I have been feeling a bit down but I think that's because of the topics I'm talking about in therapy and also I'm having a rubbish time at work.

Moved to America from Britain when I was 15 (17 now) and life became a very traumatic roller coaster for the past 2 years. My parents both have NPD (they’re separated) and I moved between them whilst I was here, (long story but it explains a lot, i would explain in pms) I was diagnosed with depression back in April 2018.

Life was feeling like a mess but i still had my sanity, I still had me. 

In June 2018 I smoked weed for the first time, had a really bad trip and everything changed for me. It developed actually anxiety and dpdr, I know that for sure but I feel like my soul has died, I’m not me anymore and I haven’t been since June. I’m in therapy but it’s something that I can’t really explain that well. It’s like I don’t process the world anymore. The best way I have found to be able to explain it is “my brain is like a faulty computer that downloaded a bunch of viruses and can’t work properly anymore” 

I’m so scared because I don’t know if I’ve ruined my life or what. My social anxiety got 10 million times worse, depression the same. I tried so hard in life man and I don’t want it to end like this, but I don’t know what’s happened to me.

For some time now, I had major sleeping problems, which lead to me being tired at any time of day and never having real active times (I'm only 19, by the way). For as long as I can remember, I have taken very long falling asleep. That's not really my issue, my issue is, that I have a very unstable sleep and I never seem to hit my deep sleep phase. Now if that was everything, I would have gone to my doctor and gotten myself some medication or whatnot. But recently, I had the strangest thing happen to me. When I tried to go to sleep, I suddenly started to focus on my breathing. I didn't really think it was an issue, until I suddenly stopped breathing for a moment, because I was trying to think of something else (even right now, I sometimes  forget to breathe in). It takes so long, that my heart starts to beat really heavily and I need to take a deep breath. This happens over and over again, and in addition to that, my thoughts when going to sleep, have turned into some kind of massive clusterfuck of random thoughts, that give me no rest. I already talked to the people closest to me, and everyone says the same: they believe I'm stressing out over something that I don't know about. As another side note, right now I couldn't be happier in my life. I recently got a girlfriend, my job brings me joy and in general my situation should please me. Nonetheless I always have this feeling of uneasiness and my heart starts beating really heavily. I'm scared that something in my head isn't working as it should or that I'm overthinking things, that I shouldn't. I already thought of visiting a therapist, but before that, I wanted some help from my favourite community. Maybe some of you know something, that could calm me down. Thanks in advance.

79,"As written in the title.

I find it hard to open up about anything (anything) in my life, and I'm already talking about it with a therapist, but since the next session is in.. a while.. I just wanted to get this off my chest and maybe start a discussion with you guys about something.

**ME PERSONALLY:**

For me it's partially a very REAL sense that i'll be judged and shamed for what I feel. I, for one, see other people being judged harshly by the same people who I'm supposed to be ""open"" with all the time. 

I have a hard time seeing whether it's a problem I have (as in: me, not others), or that the enviroment is this way and always has been, and I'm just starting to see it now. It's not a treatment I want for myself..I guess it's the reason why I'm in therapy. 

But that WISH that you could to it still lingers. I want to be myself 100% of the time, but I can only do that 50% of the time. The rest is spent swallowing what I feel. 

**QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS:**

Have you had a situation in which you feel like you NEED to talk to somebody, but the people you care most feel off-limits, for one reason or another?

How can you truly, faithfully open up to someone if every time you honestly expose yourself to others, you suffer?

What if it's clear they wouldn't understand your situation? ",28Feb2019,1

I've just been feeling like I'm a placeholder in people's lives. Just here until someone better comes along. No matter what I do I can't shake this feeling. 

Those dark thoughts have come back and they are the only thing that make me semi happy. The thing is, I could never actually go through with them. I'm in this constant fight between wanting to just give up,but still being strong enough not to ya know?

81,"I go to school everyday. I sort of like it, except people think Im weird. I try to talk to people but I dont make sense to them apparently. I like to write poems and stories. Im working on a long story right now. Its probably going to be around 100 pages. Im hand a 530 word scene of it in. We had to write short stories in class. They could only be up to 730 words. I wrote a short scene from mine. We had to do peer edits but nobody wanted to edit mine. I sit alone in that class. All the desks are in rows.

Group projects suck. The teacher lets us pick our groups. That means Im the last person to be in a group. The teacher puts me with people and it feels weird. Im pretty sure people laugh about me. I try to give ideas.

I sit alone in front of my locker during lunch. I mostly add to my story. Sometimes I really want to sit with someone else. I have before but they usually dont hang out with me again. I feel internal frustration. Im a bit different but Im not bad.

I struggle in my classes. I feel energetic a lot of the time. I cant sit still. I try to write notes though. My handwriting is illegible though. People never want to study with me because of that. I do well in Creative writing though. I also space out and lose track of time sometimes. It scares people.

I sometimes have to go to a different room to get help with my work. Its helpful. It sucks when Im having a not so good day though. I become moody and irritable. School work is hard when that happens. My thoughts race. I want to talk a lot. Nobody wants to talk with me.

I feel so lonely. Im in grade 12 now. I have no friends even though I try. Everybody says Im a bit too much and that I dress weird. I like the way I dress. I carry things I consider to be good luck such as a rock I like, marbles, gum wrappers, and a vintage pop bottle lid. I also always wear my favorite vintage blue jacket.

I need some advice.

Ive been in my job 6 months. First time I've ever passed a probation. However I'm struggling with continuing. I feel like I can't do it. I cry every day at the thought of coming into work.

85,"hi everyone, i (M23) have a older brother (M26) who showed symptoms of a nervous breakdown and panic attacks. He has a history of heavy weed usage and anger problems in the past and also showed signs of paranoid personality disorder. When he gets into this ""state"" he will often start saying things that dont make sense and say people are out to kill him and often threaten to kill and hurt my little brother. 

 Today was especially bad because he was in a distressed state and was having a panic attack and kept saying that he was going to die if he didn't sleep in the bathroom. It eventually led to him fighting my whole family so that he can sleep in the bathroom.

When he is back to ""normal"" he will refuse and help and deny that anything is wrong with him. How do we move forward in this situation? ",28Feb2019,2
86,"Hi. I dont know whether Im asking for advice or just venting, but do share your thoughts. (and sorry if anything is weird, I'm on mobile) 

I have an older sister who was diagnosed with depression. I think me and my other siblings could be diagnosis to a certain leevel of depression as well, but we've never actually got help. A few friends have told me they're concerned and want me to get help, but I'm not sure.

My sister got diagnosed wjth depression and a few disorders recently. My mom doesnt believe depression is a real sickness. She believes ""praying"" will cure anything from the heart, etc etc. While she's not a bad mother(she provides us with basic necessities), she was never emotionally supportive. She used to never let us chase our own dreams and I feel like she raises us simply as tools that she can use to brag about. Almost like she just want to create her ideal image of what a ""child"" is, and not actually someone of their own identity.

I'm getting into a university soon, but my national exam results haven't been announced. I'm aiming a scholarship, and every friend I have told me stuff like ""im sure you'll get it"" but I know the chance is low. I know they didnt mean bad but I cant tell them my troubles because they keep pushing positivity. I'm aiming for the scholarship because my mum constantly complains about money but she spends on stuff we dont need, and always guilt trips us whenever money is involved. 

I used to stay in a boarding school (that she forced me to stay in eventho i wanted to move) for 5 years and of course I needed money, and she does give me money, but whenever my dad gives me extra she'll get mad or refuse to give me money other times. Now my dad got a stroke a few years ago and he hasnt really been the same since. I guess he gets confused and disoriented, but he's fine. I really miss him but I try not to think about it. 

I want to tell my problems to my depressed sister, and i understand if she doesnt want to listen due to her own issues, but honestly I feel like because she has been properly diagnosed, she acts like only her pain is valid, because she's suffering more so I shouldn't feel anything. She keeps comparing our situations and told me my troubles are nothing compared to ours. She told me that ""she doesnt want to listen to my problems"" and I was really hurt, I think? I dont know if I have the right to feel this way, but I do. 

Right now Im just lost, I don't know what to do. I dont even know if I'm actually depressed. I've been suicidal for quite awhile but since 2 years ago I've never really felt that way anymore. Instead I just feel really empty and void of my own identity and personality, I just feel like I lost myself. I dont really feel sad much anymore and I also feel like Im losing all my passion and things I like. Its like I dont know who I am anymore. I dont know if that qualifies as ""depression"" but I know Im just not happy with the life I have right now.

I know I should be happy Im living with all the things I have today, but Im just not. ",28Feb2019,3
87,"My mental health and depression keeps getting worse with every day. I feel like im not normal, and it's been that way since I was a kid. I'm 19 now, borderline alcoholic who spends his days wishing I could be better. I feel like my mental way of thinking is totally different than your guy's, and it's low key killing me inside.

I've made horrible, horrible life choices that haunt me deeply. It's 7:02 right now and I can't sleep bc all I can think about is how I randomly chose to cheat on my ex wife and flushed our life with my daughter down the drain, so now I get constant anxiety and panic attacks thinking about it. About how I wish it could all be different.

I legitimately, seriously, want to get better. I've never looked into my toxic behavior before, and I've been a little shit / a horrible person since birth I think. I'm not trying to put myself down, but generally the shit that I've done to myself and other is insane. I've honestly, probably ruined about 20 lives since I was about 6, mine included.

I wanna put the bottle down. I wanna fix my health. I wanna save money and get a cute girlfriend and all of that, but how?? How can I do that when I've got this weight tied to my feet, of all my past decisions? And feeling like my chest is gonna burst constantly.

I don't know what to say or even think when the therapist asks me these. Every time I answer, clumsily and feeling fake while doing ir, the words sound silly and ..like i'm overreacting. And then...my head starts to doubt itself.

My internal monologue starts diminishing what i've just said THE MINUTE I say it out loud. ""You're being very dramatic"" ""Is this true though?"" ""Are you sure the therapist isn't laughing at you right now? She probably thinks you're undeserving of the help but she wants the money"" ""your mom would say you're being ridiculous right now.""

89,"I've never posted to reddit before, but I just need something right now. I'm a (way too) heavy male I'm in my 2nd semester of college right now and things are good for the most part. I love my job and I'm doing well in most of my classes. My professors are helpful and engaging, and everything in perfect. But I can't escape the fact that I always feel like I'm in danger. 

I've always had anxiety problems ever since I was a little kid. I was even on xanax in 4th grade for a while. I started anti-depressants last year, but I'm less than regular with those because I keep worrying I'll run out. But over the course of these last few months my usual general anxiety that I've learned to control has been devolving into paranoia. I keep hearing people laughing and even though I know it's not at me, I keep thinking it is. I can't escape the feeling that people are following me even though I know they're just trying to go to class. The inverse of that is also true, I keep thinking people think I'm following them (although I know everyone thinks this at least sometimes). I keep seeing things move around in the dark of my room and it's only gotten worse since my roommate dropped out because now I can't attribute the movement to him. All of this I think people experience at least once in a while, but the worst part has been my dreams. 

I don't know why but I've had reoccurring dreams all my life on a regular basis, usually a few nights a part (probably normal but idk), some pleasant, some not so much. Lately I've been having a lot of nightmares. They happen night after night and they don't change until I ""solve"" them. What I mean by this is that I keep having horror/suspense movie dreams where I typically have to just survive the situation, or save everyone. The most vivid example happened last week where I had to survive the xenomorphs. It took me 4 days to solve it. I don't know exactly how many times I died in those dreams only to wake up sweating with my heart beating out of my chest, but those were the worst 4 days so far. I don't think I got more than a couple hours of sleep during that span. Basically the theme of every nightmare is that I'm in danger. 

Even though I live in a dorm I live alone. There's a surplus of rooms available in my dorm due to people either dropping out, moving to a nicer building, or joining a frat. But I'm still always anxious they're going to move someone new into my room because they can do that based on the housing contract and I can't afford to pay the money so they don't do that. I'm worried they're gonna come in and see the mess that I'm always trying to clean but can't keep up with and think ""wow, what a fat slob"". I'm worried that I'm gonna make their experience worse with my presence. I feel like I make everyone around me less happy. I can see it on their faces. 

My best friend from high school came to the same college as me although he lives in the dorm just across the road along with all the other people from my high school. They formed a group and I was in it first semester, but I kept accidentally saying dumb/depressing stuff and now it's like every time I hang out with them I just instantly kill the mood. They all started drinking and smoking which I don't do. I don't drink because I'm worried about the alcoholics in my family and I already know I can be susceptible to addiction, and I don't smoke because I'm worried about the off chance it makes me more anxious than I already am and I don't think that's something I could handle. But I've isolated myself from them because of these things and I miss hanging out with my best friend. I miss hanging out with people in general. I've been too busy trying to pass my writing classes.

Easily my biggest challenge in school is the fact that I seem to be completely unable to write anything prompted unless there is someone holding my hand the entire process. This goes for all lengths of writing. I can't even write more than a couple sentences (unless it's word vomit like this). I already failed my history class last semester and I don't know if I'll pass my current English class. I only get two shots at each and they're university required. That's my biggest worry right now is whether it's even worth staying in college just because I don't know if I'll be able to pass two entry level classes. I have A's in everything relevant to my major (Chem Ed) but I feel like if I stay and fail I'll let everyone down. The pressure and stress keep getting to me and I can't help but punch myself. 

One habit I can't get rid of is that I punch my head hard whenever I get angry at myself. I can't help it, it just comes out of nowhere. I also bite my hand completely on impulse. It's to a point where I have trouble with moving my thumb. I can't think for more than a few seconds at a time. I can't escape the fact that I'm shitty to everyone. I keep fucking up. I don't know what to do. Lately my thoughts have changed from ""I want to die"" to ""I need to die"". I don't know why. Lately this thought has been coming to my mind at random moments and I can't help but to bite and punch myself. I hate when I get angry like that. I used to get really angry in elementary school. I was probably suspended more days than I was actually there because I would constantly let the all the kids get to me and I'd throw a desk. I hate that I used to do that. I hated in high school  when I would meet someone for the first time and they would say ""weren't you that kid that threw desk in 2nd grade"" and all I could say was ""Yeah I used to have a lot of issues"". And then awkward silence, then they'd move on. All I can think is ""I let down another person""

The first couple weeks I took it, I found I couldn’t cry and I couldn’t orgasm, but now I’m back to normal in those departments. 

I know that sounds silly, but I haven’t necessarily noticed an improvement in my mental health because of the medication. 

I notice a shift when I take my ambien to get to sleep and have a really good night’s sleep. I notice an immediate improvement after I see my therapist. I notice an improvement when I have a shift at work and feel I did a really good job. I notice an improvement when I sing, or write, or make people laugh. 
I notice an improvement when I frame my thoughts better and take productive actions towards goals. 

But my thoughts still take me down a dark path, and I will spiral into panic and depression if I have nothing to do with my day, and sit around just thinking and thinking and thinking and eventually I think myself into a hole.
I even overdosed and had a suicide attempt just a couple weeks ago, which is the worst I’ve ever been.

I feel like without the medication I would still have these natural ups and downs, and the things that are helping me would still help me, and even with the pristiq I obviously still have spiralling constant obsessive thoughts about how I’m not good enough, how no one will ever love me, how I’m destined to be alone forever and not made for love etc etc etc 
And I mean pristiq won’t take that away and hasn’t eased it because obviously no drug can change your thought patterns, just your chemistry and thus your mood, right?

I forgot to take it today and didn’t notice any difference. I had a pretty alright day considering how it’s been the past few months. I’ve experienced no side effects at all when I started the medication and no side effects today when I forgot to take it.

It almost just feels like it doesn’t actually do anything to me!?

This morning I woke up and looked at my hand and they looked completely normal to me... even slightly feminine. My whole life I had been so insecure about my hands, I constantly use to hide them. Suddenly I realize my hands were NEVER weird (which a lot of people have told me before when I would say they are). My depression and anxiety had been at an all time low this month, but I never thought it would have such a big impact on my own physical perception of myself!

I can attribute this great month to the big changes I've made in the way I think (with help from group therapy) and by practicing self-trust. Where instead of looking to everyone around me for validation of my decisions, my value and even who I am as a person, I learned to trust myself. Once I stopped looking to other people to validate who I was no longer confined by what others told me I could or could not do. I also stopped caring about what people thought of me, cause I no longer feel this need for validation from others. I'm starting to really love who I am and feel ownership over it. 

I just wanted to share in hopes this may help someone to change their perspective (which isn't a fix-all but it sure makes more good days and not so good days more bearable).

106,"I've been meaning to do this for a long time. I don't know how to say this or even where to start. All I know is that I'm depressed and have been my entire life.

I feel like I'm in this repetitive loop of poor thinking behaviour and fluctuating emotions that I just can't overcome. I'm so ridiculously scatterbrained that its such a struggle to focus on anything and to be present in a moment. Im so deeply 'in my head'.

I've tried to figure out what's wrong in my own research and honestly I've related to a lot of what I've read about ADHD, OCPD, mood disorders, anxiety, and honestly maybe even a little on the spectrum. I'm a chronic overthinker which when turned inwards has been destructive but when applied to a specific topic of interest I admittedly become very creative and deeply analytical -- striving for as much perfection and understanding as possible with an odd obsession for statistics and numbers.

I'm a deeply private person and talking about myself, especially my struggles makes me very uncomfortable. I'm Canadian but visiting a psychologist without any plan is *very* expensive, I've tried them a couple times when I was younger (for context I'm 24) and I never really got much from it. Felt like I was just paying hundreds of dollars to vent to an apathetic stranger.

I'd like to speak with a doctor about possible solutions to help my brain chemistry but I have no idea how to do that. Do I just book an appointment with my regular doctor and tell them I'm depressed in order to get a referral to someone? Any advice would be appreciated.",28Feb2019,3

108,"Hi there, new around here. I'll start with some back story.

Wife and I are in our late twenties, together 4 years, married for about 1 and a half. She has been struggling with depression and anxiety her whole life. She has also attempted suicide a few times in the past.

Lately things have been good, quite stressful as there is so much going on in our lives, but things have been ok...

In the last week, I noticed ny wife didn't seem like herself. She was very anxious, snappy, picking fights with me... etc. Then a specific event, which doesn't need to be expanded on, seemed to spark a downward spiral with her.

She hasn't been talking or eating much. She has been sleeping almost all the time. And last night, she told me she was tired of everything and that she wanted to ""go"". I tried to sympathize with her and just listen... but it was breaking my heart.

This morning I left for work but decided I shouldn't leave her alone. I came back home for the day and found that she was about to take some pills. I feel overwhelmed right now... I love her and I can't do this alone. 

I urged her to come to the hospital with me today and the whole experience was... well... a major disappointment. We felt unsafe in the waiting room, filled with people who clearly weren't all there, shouting, and pacing around. It didn't seem like the right place to even be in...  we decided to leave and were threatened to have police called on us for being a danger to our daughter. Really a sad, sad experience for someone who is DESPERATELY seeking help...

I feel helpless right now, and like I'm about to lose my partner, and best friend. I'm not sure what I'm expecting out of this thread... just a vent more than anything.

Thanks for reading.",28Feb2019,19

114,"I don't even know if this is the right place to post this but I figured I might be able to get some answers. The title explains it all pretty much, I cannot explain my sudden I now have of snakes. It's not a fear as such but an overwhelming hatred of them and a desire to kill them. 

I love almost all animals and never had a problem with snakes before this (I actually liked them and wanted one as a pet a while ago) however I have been diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety for several years now but nothing like this has ever happened before but I don't know if that is related. 

I'm not too sure of the names of the pills I'm on as I'm not allowed access to them unless I'm taking them which is supervised due to an overdose attempt. I also have a messed up sleep pattern where I sleep for almost an entire day, usually waking up around 5-7pm and going back to sleep around 3am. 

I can't explain my sudden desire to see every snake on earth exterminated, I know it is not rational as I have never had any negative encounter with a snake or even ever been scared by them. In fact where I live snakes are pretty uncommon and reclusive and I've never actually seen one in the wild and there is only one deadly species native to the country.

I know this hatred is irrational but I can't shake it and I just feel if I ever see a snake I will attempt to decapitate it. I just don't understand this, I love animals of all types but now snakes are my number one hated thing in the world.

I am unable of doing something for the people around me, I don't do anything with the talents I have, I am boring and forgettable and unentertaining and selfish and an attention whore and more bad stuff.

Also, I can't really explain it so I'll just tell what happened, I was playing the game bitlife on my phone and she told me to show her what I was doing. In the game there's and option to murder someone (there's nothing graphic at all, it's a text based game) and I did that. She went on to telling me how I shouldn't play that game because I have mental health problems and ""since I'm having thoughts"" its terrible for me to play that game.

Here's my problem- I'm currently manic and have been thinking for days about what I will tell my psychiatrist in my next appointment(which is later today). I have so many things I want to discuss with him but every single time I go in, I blank or don't know what to say. It's not that im uncomfortable telling him everything, I just feel like I don't know what to say even after rehearsing it 100 times. Ive even written it down and brought it in but I feel like I just cant express it in a way that can be understood the way i understand it(if that makes any sense). Recently ive been hooking up with a ton of people which I honestly feel like is the worst behavior I have and I do this every time im manic, but ive never been able to open up about it completely to my doctors. I dont lie, but I feel like I dont tell the complete truth even though I really want to. I also just added another 7k to my already high amount of debt. At the moment Im not bothered by this but I know myself and its only a matter of time before I spiral and these things start getting to me again. I feel incompetent when I see my doctors because I know what my problems are but I really dont know how to form the words and ask for help.

Sorry this post is all over the place. Im just feeling really hopeless right now because I know I need help, and Im trying to get it, but I just simple dont know what to say. Its so upsetting because I know if i dont open up then they cant help me, and if they cant help me my depression is gonna come back, and if that happens who knows when the next time ill even schedule an appointment is.

120,"So, I have diagnosed severe GAD and social anxiety. I go to therapy every other week and have made significant progress over the past year. I’ve been looking for jobs recently and going on interviews, and I just feel like it contradicts everything I am supposed to be working on in therapy. During one of my last sessions my goal was to work on being my “authentic self,” but how do I do that while navigating the modern-day job market? Employers don’t want to hear about your authentic self during an interview. I’m constantly quite literally told to NOT be my authentic self when interviewing for a job. I’m supposed to lie and be fake and make myself out to be someone that I’m not just to get the job. This has become increasingly difficult because it is just reinforcing the idea that I’m not good enough which is something I’ve been struggling with for a long time.

Interviews make me so uncomfortable even though I practice SO hard. It just feels really fake and demeaning to sit there knowing that the person is judging every single thing you say. I can’t just think of it as a normal conversation because it isn’t. They’re writing down everything I say and if I say something wrong or “too honest” then they won’t hire me.

I’m beginning to think that self-employment is the only thing that will work for me, but it isn’t the most consistent income. I petsit on the side and I don’t have the same problem because I feel much more in control of who I’m in contact with and how I’m viewed. I don’t feel judged or like I need to lie or pretend to be someone else to my clients, and I will still get work.

And then the storm of bipolar hit my senior year of highschool and everything went to hell. Failed 2 classes, started averaging C's.

125,"Okay, so I'm a 20 year old european woman recently diagnosed with BPD. I suffer from frequent panic attacks, dissociative episodes and general anxiety, among many other mental health issues. Lately I have been working really hard on myself, have found the right medication and I'm starting to get my life together after years of being depressed and severely anxious. Right now I live with a wonderful sweet man and our awesome cat and I'm going to university soon to study philosophy, if everything keeps going well. I wasn't able finish my senior year of high school the last time due to severe depression and horrible circumstances in my personal life then. I moved to the other side of the country, took a year to heal and just be, and this time it looks like I'm going to graduate with excellent results.

I had a rough childhood, was really poor and bullied at school by both teachers and students, neglected by parents, started living alone at 15, later got into drugs, never have had friendships longer than a few months because of my BPD, have moved by myself over 10 times in 5 years in order to escape from my problems etc, my life has overall been very chaotic, so much bad has happened that I'm not even going to get into it right now. My mental health has got worse and worse since about the age of 7. I have been repeatedly let down by life already, so basically at this point I feel stronger than ever and ready for what's to come, good or bad, I'm done with being the victim.

In the last couple of days, I have started thinking about an incident that happened when I was about 13 or 14. A little bit of backstory: my parents hadn't had any sexual relations with eachother (except my father raping my mother once) in over 10 years by then. My father left my mother to be with other women and didn't support her in any way while she was expecting me, so she became very depressed while pregnant. Also she was 23 and he was 41 at that point. When I was born, they got back together for some reason, but my father basically became disgusted with my mother, because certain parts of her body were  ""worn out"" after pushing out a child. I had fun with my father as a small child, he was my favourite parent, as my mother had mental health issues (very possibly also BPD) and I was scared of her, because she got angry really easily. About the time I started school, my mother was completely hysterical most of the time and my father just didn't care about me and when he talked to me, it was usually to say something bad. He always seemed weird to me, like something wasn't quite right in his head. He made me feel uneasy and I avoided being alone in the same room with him. I heard them fight every night. I was scared to be at home and also at school, so there was basically no safe place for me to be.

The incident has always been somewhere in my memories, but somehow I have never thought about it until now that my mental health is finally getting better and I'm getting stronger. So what happened was that the 13 or 14 y/o me was showering and my father, who usually didn't give a shit about me, entered the bathroom and started washing my naked body and my hair. I don't remember if he was wearing clothes or where did he rub me, or how long did he do it. But I now have realized that it wasn't interely normal, was it? I don't know why this incident has never passed my mind until now. I remember I was feeling very uncomfortable, but I don't remember how I reacted. But now I feel so confused about my whole childhood. I feel that there might have been something else, some memories that my brain has blocked me from completely, something that drove me to what I have become. I remember feeling sexual urges and having fantasies from about the age of 5. I have also had a slight essential tremor in my body that gets quite bad when nervous, from about the same age. So there's that. So perhaps that wasn't the only time he touched me, but merely the last and the only incident that I remember? I feel something else might have happened or was happening. After my parents divorced when I was 14, my father told my mom that I never meant anything to him anyway and he hasn't contacted me ever since. I told about the incident to my mother (with whom I am getting along really well now, she really regrets everything she did to me as a child and I have forgiven her) today and she was shocked. She also told me that my father never changed my diapers or bathed me when I was a baby, or was never interested in taking care of his only child in any other way. I have always thought that I have a remarkably good memory regsrding my childhood, I remember certain incidents very precisely - what someone was wearing, what the time was, how my surroundings looked and exactly how I felt. But after analyzing the incident in the shower, I feel that my whole childhood has become a blur suddenly.

So, basically the middle-aged man gets my adolescent mother pregnant, then gets disgusted with her because her body has changed, mentally abuses her for years while living off my mom's small income, who alone has to feed a husband, a child, ten dogs and livestock, and by the time my story takes place, hasn't had sex in over 10 year except raping my mom once, and now he comes and washes his teen daughter's naked body in the shower, never having felt any fatherly feelings towards her. I feel like something else is coming back to me, but I can't hold on to it. At the same time I really don't want to think of the man as a monster, if I'm not sure of anything. Maybe was just a weird man who didn't understand what was appropriate and what wasn't, although I still despise him for how he treated my mother. I have been feeling great emotional pain and anxiety tonight and had several dissociative episodes, the kind that I haven't felt in many months. I feel a weird pressure in my chest which reminds me of some of my worst moments. I don't know what to think or what to do, I suddenly feel so confused. I'm definitely telling my psychiatrist about it the next time I see her, though. What do you think, is there a possibility that I was sexually abused by my father as a child and I don't remember it? Are there any realistic possibilities to get access to lost memories? What should I do?

I apologise if the text was hard to read in any way. I am not from an English-speaking country, besides my thoughts are racing and I feel really confused.

Tl;dr: I'm a young woman with BPD and several other mental health issues. I recently remembered an incident where my abusive and neglectful father came to wash my body when I was showering at 13 or 14. Is there a possibility that this is simply the only incident I remember and that I was sexually abused as a child and don't remember it? I have a strange feeling that something's starting to come back to me, but perhaps my brain is blocking me from it. Read the whole story for more information.

He says I'm destroying my life (of course I don't believe that and I know I will figure something out eventually but this kind of talk makes you feel like a failure) and won't understand that that university was so bad it smashed my sanity to pieces and that the papers are worth nothing.

I'm going to a vocational school, I'll become a car mechanic. There's 1 year left. I want to complete the school but allow myself to choose a different job later. The difficult part is that I'm a woman and a short one on top of that and I'm worried that I won't be employed by anyone because of that.

Today was my last day at my current job. I worked in a car wash for 2 months, earlier in a factory, also for 2 months and was looking for a job inbetween those, which took me 2 months. I burn out very quickly and with my actual schooling ( I finished high school) there aren't many jobs I could do, even less of those I could endure for more than a month. I'm terrified of phone calls (it doesn't get better with practice) so no office work for me. Last time I was unemployed my mood dropped significantly and it's not good. I really don't want to go through this again and again.

On top of that I started to think that I'm not as good person as I think and there's no way to test it. Usually when talking with people not coming from internet groups I experience a weird form of isolation, like we can have a nice conversation but I always feel a wall separating us and tbh it makes me feel so lonely it hurts. I don't have many friends, even less people to meet in person. Both are far away from me now and I really feel like I need to have someone in my city to drink tea with from time to time.

So, what can I do? I'll rest for a few days, try to apply for more jobs (starting to get desperate). And maybe watch anime, who knows.

133,"So I'm 21 male, forever alone.
I did notice recently, every time girls give me attention or anything like that I'm trying my best to fuck this up(and this works great so far).
I can not approach girls who is in ""my league"", but I easily go for girls who won't ever date me(like these who 190+ cm). Or when I get attention on tinder I start acting really weird and stuff. 
So I find out, that I'm not scared of failure, but actually scared of success, and doing my best to stay lonely, meanwhile I literally crying every night because of loneliness.
I can not say I'm sociophobic or anything, I feel comfortable around people(and I feel better in group of a lot of people).
Don't really feel like I need friends, but I really feel that it would be nice to have a gf, but everytime fucking everything on my own.
I feel like I don't fear of women(as they were only ones who actually act nice to me thru my life, meanwhile males abused me all my life know). But I'm not even sure now.

134,"My mum suffered from an extreme paranoia which ultimately made me very scared of pretty much everything. I know realise it was even harder for me growing up because I am autistic. My mum told me that the government is trying to reduce the population by forcing people to take vaccines which have poison in them. She says it will not act immediately but will take affect later. Now I’m 21 I know how silly this is. I’ve realised that all the things she told me were not true. It was a very hard realisation. My boyfriend who is my world wants me to get vaccinated because he is worried about me. I want to do it to make him happy and for myself. I booked an appointment but being afraid of needles and the fear of veins made it even worse. I became so so scared. Stupidly I left my doctors note where my mum found it. She went crazy at me and started shouting at me and telling me all the fears I had tried so hard to push down. She kept saying if I have it I will die. She made me cry I was so upset, I ended up not going to get it done. I feel pretty emotionally scarred again not to mention I feel like a failure to my BF. The two main people in my life have completely opposite views and I can’t do one thing without displeasing the other. Whatever I do people are angry at me. I’m so scared of everything.

136,"I can’t believe I’m even posting on here but maybe just writing it all down will help somewhat. 

I made a mistake last year and found myself pregnant just as I signed onto study my second degree at university.  A guy I’d been on a few dates with months prior (and slept with) invited me to hang out  and low and behold we had sex. It wasn’t harming anyone and I didn’t feel bad about it because hey - we’ve been here before right? No harm done. 

A contraceptive fuck up lead my period to be late. And later. And later. I was absolutely convinced there was no way I could be (I have believed for years I was infertile) my best friend finally convinced me to test. The little lines flashed up so fast. I threw it at her (gotta give it to my bestie she held my pee stick like a champion). I took 3 more tests. Positive. 

So I’m 21, pregnant with a 30yo mans baby. We live 3 hours away from each other. I did what I thought was right and text him immediately to tell him. It shook us both. We agreed not to discuss anything but he would travel to me that weekend for a chat in person. 

It was awkward and painful. He didn’t want it under any circumstance but said if I did he would support me. I didn’t want the baby. I just didn’t think I could ever have an abortion. How could I do that? I thought I couldn’t have children? After hours of essentially avoiding the topic I blurted out I can’t do this. I can’t get rid of it. We said our goodbyes and he told me to take some time to think on it. He text me that night that he was crying and that this is heartbreaking (he’s in the middle of finally getting his dream career and had a new girlfriend). So I lived with it for a while. 

Every single person who knew (my mum, the dad, close friends) pressures me into an abortion. Sending links to clinics, telling me I’m too young and this is stupid. I’m destroying my life and the dads. The pressure was unbearable. I cried every night (and I know this sounds so crazy) I was apologising out-loud to this tiny clump of cells. If I have you we will have to go live with your grandparents. If I have you I’ll never be able to afford to take you to Disney World. It would just be me and you and it would be so hard. You wouldn’t have the life you deserve. After looking at my local abortion clinic online, the picture of the gloomy dark door terrified me. I text the dad and said if I was going to go through with it it couldn’t be there. Very sweetly he offered to pay for me to have the abortion done privately in a swish lovely expensive clinic. Ok. But I needed more time, I knew it was the right thing to do I just needed longer. I wanted longer with it. Is that wrong? 

The pressure continued. My mum phoned every day to ask me if I’d booked my clinic appointment. The Dad was going out of his mind planning on going to travel the world quickly before I had this child and ruined his life (“I’ll come back in time for it to be born”) the pressure was fucking awful. 

I was heading out one evening, and shaved my legs in the shower. Post shower I noticed some blood on my leg and thought oh here we go - I’m fucking crap at shaving! No. The blood started and didn’t stop (graphic, I’m sorry) and it wasn’t from my leg. I lost the clump of cells that night and bled for 2 long , painful weeks. I had to ‘labour’ and my friend held my hand while I screamed trough the agony, and ultimately flushed my baby down the toilet. A night in hospital, multiple follow up appointments. Multiple internal examinations (so many doctors have seen my lady parts now, the horror). Nurses holding my hand and telling me they’re so very sorry and I could ‘try again’. But they had no idea. No idea that I was going to have an abortion - and the baby just died before I could? Everyone around me was relieved, while I crumbled. The dad never came to see me (he had no obligation to) and we’ve never heard from each other again (apart from me having a 4am drunk breakdown and sending him a 7 minute audio message - sorry). I live in my bed for a few weeks with my best friend, Netflix, and so much comfort food. 

It’s been a few months now and I’m mostly ok. University is ok. I’m going to have 2 degrees by the end of the year and please looooord let me have a hotshot career and look badass sexy in a suit. But sometimes I’m not ok. Like tonight. I am racked with the most painful guilt. It hurts so much. Everyone around me wanted this clump of cells to die and it did. I know it wasn’t really a baby, and it had no real life ahead of it but the fact I was essentially just debating killing it for weeks is almost too painful. I thought about miscarriage support groups but heck - I was only going to kill it anyway right? I’m at a bit of a loss. Sometimes life is good, and sometimes it’s the middle of the night and I’m crying all over again. And I don’t know why. I couldn’t have had that baby. Everyone around me seems to have moved on (understandable) and my mums called me out for being ‘reckless’ and demanded to know who was the father and what was I thinking? And I’m just wondering how to really move on. Will I ever be ok? Will I be ok if one day I decide fuck yeah now it’s baby time - but what about the one i was terminating? Was it my fault it died? What if I did keep it? 

Thank you so much if you read all of this. I’ll admit sometimes I do avoid the really long posts.. but I needed to explain my story to someone. So thank you for reading my very small tragedy, I hope whoever you are that you’re doing ok, life is treating you kindly and your kicking any mental health demons ass. 

Sending warm hugs to anyone who is struggling.

138,"Someone confided in me and said they have a lot of scary, self-critical internal monologue.  Sometimes suicidal.  They say they don't hear voices, but the internal monologue feels like it's not their own thoughts.

I of course urged them to see a therapist, and they're planning to.  Is this a sign of a serious mental health disorder?  Is it ""on the way"" to hearing voices?  Or is it common with the general population to have self-criticizing internal monologue that doesn't necessarily feel like theirs?  Personally, I've never had that, but I get intrusive/racing thoughts so I could kinda comprehend how it feels.

139,"Hi reddit

So I've been feeling very different the last few months, before I go into whats going on with me now, Ill give you some back story!

So when I was young I was a pretty normal kid from the ages of well birth till 10 or 11, normal childhood with no real trauma, maybe my father was a bit too liberal with how he shown his frustration with me and my brother, but it wasn't anything horrific, I do remember him grabbing my throat and aggressively telling me to stop complaining about the food he made, you know just remarks kids make, they don't have that social filter yet. my father is very chilled and layed back nower days, like when he found out I smoke cannabis he was very calm about it. so 11 or 12 was when things got worse, I started secondary school (middle school) I didn't fit in well at all! I was very anti social and have always rathered the company of myself and very close friends, even before starting secondary school I was getting into a lot of fights and was a bully which pains me to say. I would put others down to give myself control and power. Back to secondary school, I was bullied a lot because I was different, I was over weight and weird, I didn't know social norms and was often seen as 'lower' than others. the bullying I got was often just verbal until year 8 (I was like 12 -13 ) things got very physical often getting physically attacked each day. this drove me into a deep and dark depression and issues with my weight and self image, as well as many personality based self esteem issues. 

Years later things smoothed out, I found who I was (at the time) and thought I had found my footing, multiple LSD experiences helped me to find many aspects of myself, My love for creativity and knowledge, and many of my political and world views were established in that era! now I am 20 things have happened in the years since my school days, lost love, a job that wore me down and made me feel helpless, and the rising fear of mortality and that I may never achieve what I want out of life.

Now for the past few months I've felt very empty, like I can experience emotions and I know that they are there, but I feel like my empathy has dropped off the face of the earth, now I understand what people are going through, but cant actually feel sad for them nor do I feel that other peoples emotions impact me anymore, obviously those close to me I care about and care if they are struggling, but I feel distanced from my emotional response.

I have social anxiety disorder and depression but now I feel like it could be more than that? I just don't feel like myself, not completely anyway. I love being by myself, I know how to entertain myself, I often talk to myself and host/ commentate what I am doing, make jokes with myself, have in depth conversations with myself and often see myself as three different minds... I guess its kinda like I'm split up into my ego, superego and ID, the one that overthinks and is very negative, cynical and mostly based in reality. The one that is ambitious and feels like they can do anything, the one with all the confidence and doesn't doubt himself, and the one that doesn't really do much but holds the peace of the two conflicting ego and superego.

Does anyone relate or have any ideas on what is going on with me? any personal stories that may lead me to some answers, that would be amazing! thank you to anyone who actually takes the time to read this or reply to this!",28Feb2019,2
140,"So I don’t even know how to put this into words so bare with me. 

Backstory:
I’ve been pretty down on my lucky lately and by that I mean I’ve been going through A LOT like homelessness, car loss, unemployment some serious business.

While I’ve had a lot of people help me out but I find myself taking advantage of them. Not because I want cause I really truly don’t but I just find my motivation to find a job and etc. to go away.

I hate not having work and not being independent after being so for several years. So I don’t understand why I’m feeling the way I am. 

My problem: 

1. I find myself lying just to lie. They won’t even be bad lies but the fact that I am just frustrates the fuck out of me because that’s not the person I am.
Then sometimes it evolves into bigger more elaborate lies that I have to wiggle myself out of. 
I can see myself becoming more manipulative and deceitful and I don’t know how to stop it.

2. I have no motivation to do a damn thing. I’ve been shut down so much recently I don’t want to do anything. But at the same time I know exactly what I have to do how to do it I just won’t. Then I just feel bad about myself. 

The best part it is it’s that it’s my lively hood at stake, like I’m literally homeless and I don’t know why I won’t work on fixing my issues while people are helping around me.

3. I have pretty bad anxiety that’s a lot worse than I give it credit for. It’s pretty on and off but I can usually deal with when and have coping methods when my life is in literal shambles

141,"First post here. I'm a female in my 20s. I think I suffer from executive dysfunction or something similar (I also have depression and anxiety, both of which fluctuate in severity). I have always been like this, but it has gotten worse, largely due to a series of traumatic events over the past couple years. I procrastinate until the very last second, or don't do it at all. I feel so frozen. I avoid friends because I don't want to talk about my life. Confronting issues is just the last thing I want to do. I end up not doing things I'm supposed to do and sit there feeling anxious, empty, and restless. Why can't I just do things? I know why, because I'm afraid I won't succeed. But that's so stupid, I know I should try anyway. Yet it's so hard. Does anyone else deal with this and have tips for managing it?",28Feb2019,1
142,"  

Today I felt a big relief from a long break-down, and I wanted to share some things I wrote down for myself.  

&amp;#x200B;

· Today I felt hope, and even if that hope disappears again tomorrow, I will still know that this kind of hope DOES exist. If I forget this feeling, I still know that I have planted this seed in my brain which can eventually grow, even if I can’t see it on some days.

&amp;#x200B;

· Today I learned about the strategy of ”so what?”. When I really worry about something, I should try to ask myself “so what?” a couple of times. Example: “What if I go back into my work field again only to have another stress breakdown?” – “so what?” – “Then I would have gotten nowhere” – “so what?” – “Then I would have to find another career path” – “so what?” – “Hmmmm….. then I would be able to leave this work field with good conscience because I gave it a good try and learned it was not for me.”

&amp;#x200B;

· I don’t have to feel swallowed by life and work (probably bad translation). To some degree, I can dictate my life instead of letting life/surroundings/others dictate me. It is okay and even necessary to say no sometimes, to set boundaries, to ask for another way of doing things, to ask for help, to make mistakes, and to take care of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

· I should set lower and shorter expectations for myself and not obsess so much about a distant future. I should not worry so much about making “the right choice” in life and doing everything perfectly right now. Everyone makes mistakes and learns along the way. I have worried so much that I might someday need to turn my life in a different direction than the one I am going now – but if that happens - so what? I have been so afraid of making a “wrong” choice and locking myself into a situation forever, but I realize that I always have the ability to evolve into a new direction if I no longer find happiness in something that previously made me happy. 

And if I find myself in that situation, it doesn’t mean that “past me” made a huge mistake, it just means I am evolving into a new person. This can of course be very scary because it is new territory, but I need to remember that I will eventually learn something about myself and become a better version of myself if I just dare to walk into that scary territory and let myself lean into the vulnerability and insecurity.

&amp;#x200B;

· Today I thought: ”I am so thankful to have had this breakdown, so I got the chance to learn about myself.” This is a complete shift of mind for me and it took me by surprise. It is also completely understandable, that I did not think of this before on my darkest days, but I am so glad that this suddenly popped into my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

· I obviously know that I will not feel this inspired and happy all the time. Bad days are totally okay and necessary. But I am writing this so I can read this on a bad day and remember that this “thought-seed” of hope has been planted in my head. I will know that it IS possible to feel joy and inspiration as I do right now, even if it seems impossible sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you feel anxious about reading this, that is absolutely okay and you don’t need to take any advice from me. 

Okay, maybe just take this one advice: If you are in a bad place right now, hug your blanket and don’t be hard on yourself. It is okay to be where you are at right now &lt;3 ",28Feb2019,38
