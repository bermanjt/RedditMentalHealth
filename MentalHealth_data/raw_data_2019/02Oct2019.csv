0,"I’ve been accused of being bipolar or more than one person in my life. I don’t think I’m bipolar, what depression is part of who I am and I’ve always been. I have a problem focusing as well. Never been able to hold a job for more than 2.5 to 3 years. Now I’m 59 and I’m employed again. I’m trying to focus to rebuild my career but I simply can’t. I get distracted, i hey highs and lows, and I just can’t get anywhere. I think this is because I was taking medication to get the sleeping medication to stay after on the day. I feel better not taking medication so I should stop taking it. I also have a history of learning disabilities throughout my life. Maybe I’m just not cut out to be a working person and at my age I just don’t know what to do anymore.",02Oct2019,1
1,"Its not long and I usually see them out of direct focus and when I turn to look directly at them they're gone, I cant make out much of their anatomy as they're all black and shapes varry but I can tell they look like some kind of living shadow creature. Obviously I know it's not real but its happening more and more",02Oct2019,2
2,"This is going to sound stupid, especially since I think I already know why it happens. When I hear my roommates talking and laughing, I get annoyed and sometimes even angry. They're obviously not doing anything wrong and there's no reason I should feel like they shouldn't talk to each other.

I think the reason I feel this way is because I can't talk to either of them. There's never more than a ""hey"" or ""what's up?"" between us and barely ever anything more. I think there's a jealously or something because they both seem to have zero trouble talking even through they aren't really friends. Meanwhile I can't talk to them because I won't think of anything to say anyway and I will get so anxious that I can't even listen without desperately feeling like I need to crawl back to my room if they have anything to say.

I'm just frustrated at this point because I feel like I have to blame someone for my inability to be a normal person and just know what to talk about. I want to blame my parents for not having any guts and passing that passive, nonconfrontation personality on to me when almost everyone else seems confident and motivated. I want to blame my friends for not recognizing that I need some help getting better at just basic communication. I want to blame myself because I can't figure out what to do, and it makes me feel like an idiot since so many others have clearly at least managed to convincingly fake being well-rounded people.

I don't know what I want, whether it be advise or affirmation. But I do know that I hate being in my own life and I want to just hit the big red reset button that doesn't exist to be born into another life, another family, and maybe another time. I want to drop my problems, responsibilities, relationships, and shit social skills right into the burning dumpster they belong in and live like they never existed. And all of this came to my head just because my roommates were talking to each other. Fuck.",02Oct2019,1
3,"I wish I could go back to when I was younger. When everything felt okay. When my dad was alive, before I had to worry about school and work. I want to be a kid again, I want to experience everything for the first time again. I don't care much about the future, I didnt want to make it this far anyway. Every day I do things that make me feel nostalgic of my childhood, I don't care about doing anything new. I'm not actively suicidal, but I keep thinking how easy it would be to just not deal with all this. I'm on autopilot every day and I feel so numb. I just want to curl up and live it all again, all the good and the bad, I just want it all back. I feel like my childhood died after highschool and I'm stuck mourning it.

4,"I work at a retail store and after 2 years of working full time for the minimum wage and be degraded and downtrodden for that time, I now fear going to work. To such a degree, that I deal with a ton of mental turmoil trying to decide if it’s worth it. The job makes me feel worthless about myself and I can’t escape it. I want to quit, but if I did, it would send me down the road I was on before I got the job, which was so bad... that I contemplated suicide on the weekly at that point. I’m pathetic aren’t I?

6,Im not depressed nor have I ever been it's just that I feel a lack of emotion when I feel like im supposed to be full of emotion.

7,"I've had experience with doctors, where I open up about a concern and it's brushed off or they tell me it's ""normal"". For example I was telling my OB/GYN about how I felt postpartum: he basically asked me a couple criteria questions, then told me it's not postpartum depression and left it at that. I'm not blaming him, I just don't know how to ask questions about my mental health and he's not my PCP. There have been other experiences where I have felt shut down after trying to talk to someone (family, professional), but a good reason why it could be is because I don't know how to express my words and feelings.

So I will be seeing a PCP soon because I'm due for an annual checkup, and I really feel like I need this addressed. As I've written above, I do not have postpartum depression, I don't believe I have any form of depression. Every day, I feel dread I think. Like something is always wrong, and there's just this lump in my throat all the time like I want to cry. It's as if there's a heavy boulder in my stomach. And physically, I can't eat. I love food, but most of it makes me nauseous after a couple bites, like when I was pregnant, but I already checked and I'm not pregnant again. So I miss eating, but I try to gave snacks on me all the time like sunflower seeds, since I also bite my nails like crazy.

That's just a few surface level problems, for example. I'm not looking for a diagnosis on Reddit (please) but if anyone can share their story with me of overcoming timidness and how you were able to open up to a doctor, I would greatly appreciate it. 

tl;dr I would like to know how first experiences went with opening up to your doctor or PCP (US) about your mental health, how can they take you seriously?",02Oct2019,1

13,"I keep dissociating to the point where nothing in my life feels real. Living in an environment that can feel triggering and involves someone who chronically enables my illness and bad behavior leads to automatic helplessness and deep hooves in my memory of maladaptive and immature behaviors. When pulled together I am reserved, mature, and well-aware of what is within my limits, but frustrated by all the avenues that are closed at the moment (for example, developing my creative work or “putting myself out there,” since my life is so unstable and in limbo that it seems insane to be focusing on an “ideal life” when I don’t have health insurance or a social support system). 

Either I feel totally connected to the world to the point where everything hurts, and people say I am too sensitive, or I am so detached that even when telling the truth/recalling the past accurately, others don’t believe me or are unable to “get through” to establish the kind of strong bond that could keep me accountable. 

I have no money, no degree, few friends, and currently no job or steady income. When engaged with life, there is nothing I can’t do (this is what people tell me), and somehow anyone who cares will help me reach my goals (in a matter of time)...but everything feels risky, like life is dangling on a string. 

I’m aware of what is possible and so forth, but as soon as dissociation, depression, or panic/anxiety strikes, I start acting inappropriate, insecure, and basically a stranger to people who thought they knew me. 

In the past success felt within reach; it was just a matter of effort. Now, I’m not so sure: countless people have said I need to “let go of control” and “just trust the way things are,” which has led to a frustratingly passive mindset that has ultimately been self-defeating. 

I don’t use drugs, sex, spending money, or other risky behaviors to cope, and only take medications my doctor prescribes, however they seem to have a strange effect on me (ex:glassy, dilated pupils, lethargy or scattered energy). After being on antidepressants for half of my life (now mid-20s), it feels like there is no solid self other than the various mind-states of different medication regimens. Yet if confronted with an urgent problem or life-or-death situation, I can step up to the plate and steer myself in the right direction. A strong sense of self and reality emerges, but only with adrenaline and necessity. 

The problem is the day-to-day small things that build up and take more energy than they are worth (phone calls to insurance, following up with social service agencies, for example). Without a clear direction or connection (other than immediate survival), how can I find motivation? 

My illnesses have hurt so many people, and my greatest fear is repeating the past. No matter how aware, overwhelming feelings of shame and failure will eventually destroy the relationship. I can be optimistic and balanced in my perspective of others and the world, but as soon as I put myself into the equation, everything seems “off.” 

Self-awareness is a curse: there is so much to try to balance and keep under control, and explaining it to people tends to backfire (making an exception here). Being honest emotionally with people is necessary but also excruciating for everyone involved. 

I lost a parent at an early age, have had chronic illnesses since the start of my life, had a borderline abusive parent, extreme financial insecurity mixed with privileged situations, have been a straight-A student my whole life, have had several steady jobs, and good friends...but then lost everything due to overwhelming feelings of futility, frustration, and absurdity. I lost my status as a student, all of my personal possessions, entire savings (spent on treatments), the trust of family members, a sense of belonging to previous friend groups, and the temporary identities that kept me afloat. The sense of loss never leaves me, and it seems “excessive” in comparison to how others cope.

No matter how hard I try, getting “over” things just doesn’t work. My memory is extremely persistent and accompanies whatever is going on in the moment. For example, my childhood is so vivid and it is possible to “replay” my subjective experiences of stretches of time, the memory of which does not change, though the interpretation does. Others have always been impressed with the acuity my recollection and the simultaneous sense of prescience, indifferent to me or my fears and terrifyingly accurate. I’ll have a “hunch” that cannot be rationally explained, and it’s hard to understand how/why this happens. However if I do not actively keep pushing forward, with a kind of single-minded and intense mindset, my mind automatically “regresses” to another point in time, usually one of helplessness and hopelessness, which then undermines further efforts to progress. 

What terrifies me are the constant visions of different possibilities and the impossibility of simultaneously ignoring them and being fully present. When alert, “sober,” and attached to others, there is a kind of constant mental gymnastics and heavyweight lifting required to accomplish anything and avoid “relapsing” into a totally passive and indecisive mindset. What ought to be straight-forward and inconsequential feels like a Sisyphean/Herculean task. The only way to cope is to either minimize, ignore, or fully embrace all these symptoms, and life requires switching between these mindsets in order to cope.

Please tell me what your sense of the overall situation is, and if what is written here makes sense. Sometimes I wish there was a quick “sanity” test like they have for drunkenness on smartphones! Until then, oversharing on the Internet is the least harmful option...so there it is, a spewing of my mind into the abyss :)",02Oct2019,1
15,"I haven’t done any drugs in about 6 months besides the occasional 1 or 2 cones every few nights. Anyway, about 4 days ago I had 4 pills of ecstasy throughout the night and I was fine. The problem was when I had weed. As soon as I had 2 cones, I started hallucinating pretty badly, started having a very bad trip. I couldn’t see anything and colours switched in my head, I couldn’t think straight and I started panicking and freaking out. I was told to just ride it out, but the trip itself scared the fuck out of me. When I woke up and I was fine, that’s when the problem happened. The trip felt like my brain reworked itself backwards.

I started to not feel like I was myself, sort of like depersonalisation, I had the comedown symptoms, I had anxiety, paranoia and I felt very on edge. Sort of like I couldn’t tell what reality was, at first I thought this was psychosis. But I’m pretty sure I was just disorientated. 

Today I feel more like myself but I’ve also been having nightmares about it, my concentration isn’t as sharp, I’m getting headaches and I’ve constantly got anxiety.

I was born in Ireland, idk where there, but we moved to America when I was 5. We loved it there, we still love it, but this happened the same year of moving. My family went to go get dinner, with me, my mom dad and brother, when we went through an intersection with a truck, a truck with a drunk driver in it. It slammed into the side where me and my mom were, and it was bad. My mom, she-she killed herself just to save me. She threw her body onto mine, killing her and majorly hurting me, I almost died from it. From the crash, I am missing my left leg, right eye, half of my hearing, and almost all mental stability. (Oh yeah btw I’m 15 male) I have blackouts randomly and basically be dead for 10 minutes to 3 hours, I have no mental stability and i just break down when something, anything happens. And I now have mental issues that I was diagnosed with that I can’t explain. I was paralyzed for a month, and when I went back to school, with a fake leg and glasses with one side completely blacked out, people bullied me. They thought that “Dean the one legged freak” was going to hurt them, and talked about me stayed away from me and bullied me. This happened for over 9 FUCKING HEARS AND IS STILL HAPPENING. I’ve tried to kill myself over 20 fucking times over that time, and I’m to afraid to seek help.

24,"I've been in therapy since I was 8. Have had a psychiatrist since I was 12. Slew of issues. Autism spectrum disorder, severe anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, depression, and agoraphobia as a byproduct of all of these things. 

My mental health hasn't been great, severe dips in the last year or so, but it has come to a quick, horrific relapse since last month. I panic all day, every day. Depression is gnawing at me too.

My psychiatrist (who I love, he's saved my life) put me on a new medication (One out of five of them) because Ativan wasn't working anymore. He gave me Valium, 10mg. Never have taken it before. Significantly stronger than I expected, the first day I tried it I felt completely numb and trapped. So I immediately dropped it and returned to Ativan. Well. My psychiatrist informed me today he will no longer be putting me on Ativan because he believes that my body has become dependent on it and needs a change to save me from this collapse, even if its overwhelming at first. 

I'm autistic. I hate change. I hate this medication based off of that experience. But I have no choice now. He said to split the pill and take it easy and it'll all be well. I'm meeting with him next week to discuss everything fully. 

So I'm trying my very best to stay strong right now. I've been rocking back and forth all day, my family has been helping me as much as they can but its been a challenge. I feel like I'm going insane from the anxiety, but I rationally know I'm not. It just feels like that.

I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow. I haven't seen her in two weeks and so much has happened that I don't know where to start. 

I have to take the valium in about an hour before I go to bed, and I'm fucking terrified. Its been nonstop anxiety all goddamn day and I have no idea when its going to end. I haven't been this bad since I was fifteen years old. The medication might make me feel better? But it also might not? I'm really sorry if I'm incoherent right now. I'm in the middle of a panic attack, as you can tell. 

If anyone reads this and is religious I would appreciate a prayer (I don't practice religion and I've tried praying myself but since I don't know my beliefs I feel like its rude to pray to something halfheartedly) or some words of encouragement/positivity. Am I going to be okay?",02Oct2019,2
25,"Please skip this one if you’re feeling super down. I don’t want to drag anyone else down, just walk on by. This is really just me rambling, I needed a place to get it out. 

I try so hard to try.  I really, really do. But trying is getting harder and harder. I’ve made so many mistakes like washing out of grad school before I could finish my Ph.D, leaving me with $80k in student loans and a M.A. that is apparently only good for adjuncting. Before this year, I’d spent 5 years of tracking down and doing as many adjuncting gigs as I could just to be told over and over “Sorry, we thought we’d have enough enrollment to bring someone on full time but it didn’t work out” just to see they’d posted new ads for adjuncts. Then there’s the hospitalizations - I think it’s up to 11, but not completely sure - when things got too bad.  The years of self-harm, the medications that didn’t work and the medications that did, gaining more and more weight until I disgust myself. I’m not working (yay, brain), even though we can’t really afford for me not to work, so there’s nothing that forces me to do anything with people or over a big chunk of time so I’m very isolated.  I just get kids to school, hang out with the one that can’t go to school yet, pick kids up, feed everyone and go to bed as early as possible. Like I’d have everyone in bed and asleep by 7 if I could, because being awake just kinda hurts. The house is usually a mess. The dogs don’t get to play outside much. We’ve been eating a LOT of sandwiches and beans with rice, because standing and cooking is more energy than I have. There’s just not a lot of gas in my tank and I try as best I can to focus that on my kids.  They’re getting a pretty pale imitation of an active and involved parent, which tallies up in my head as one more failure.  I also get wound up in a huge ball of death anxiety, to the point where it’s keeping me from doing things - like, what is the point of doing anything if I’m just going to be dead in a handful of years anyway? Enjoying a bit of time with the kids, one of those golden perfect moments that you want to remember forever? Hold it as long as you can, it will slip away anyway. Then I start thinking about my kids dying, and I’m a ball of anxiety again. 

I guess I’m just feeling hopeless. I’ve been sick for a long time and I feel like a failure for not being better/doing better. My therapist would get onto me for that, but it’s just where I am at the moment. I’m tired and part of me wants to just stop trying.",02Oct2019,1

27,"Hey all,

28m in a north east state. Have always lived here but have a brother who lives in the south which doesn't help any of this. Just need to vent.

I pretty much have my own set of life issues and have a therapist currently. Ranging from mood disorders to depression to anxiety etc. However, the endless summer ends after tomorrow and fall will actually arrive. This hits me HARD every year but it's getting harder and harder as I get older and older. I'm an idiot and bought a house within the past year (that I've gotten to the point of I love it at least) here because of friends and family (NO ONE VISITS ME EVEN WHEN ASKED BUT ALWAYS SAYS WE NEED TO HANG OUT!!!). So I feel trapped.

So I'm here right now, feeling stuck. I can't leave but I don't want to stay. I love summer. I love fishing, BBQing, beaching, everything. Summer for me is basically May through September, then it's basically kill myself weather. SAD is a thing but it's worse than that. I'll do some freeze my balls off surf fishing (but it's FAR from my favorite kind of fishing) and enjoy holidays, but after that I almost die inside. I hate the cold, I hate the grey skies, I hate the trees being dead. I literally can't breathe just thinking about this and probably sound like an idiot, but I'm already fucked up as it is and this just makes it even worse.

So here I am, going through a panic attack about this bullshit weather. Stuck in a state where I stayed for everyone else but everyone fucks me over. In a relationship with a person who is good to me but I don't know that I want to be with still and would ruin her life if I broke up with her and moved. Working at a job where I can't be myself.

29,"Hi everyone, I’m seeking advice for helping my friend (M19) who is currently suffering with depression. I appreciate any advice you could give.

So the case is as follows:

My friend never talks about his feelings sober, and the only way of revealing his true feelings is by heavily being under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. His family member passed away recently, he’s not very motivated in college, he complains about his roommates quite a bit (though he acts in front of them and pretends to really like them), and seems apathic/indifferent lately, when not acting in front of his roommates and in the rest of the situations.

I found pills on his desk the other day and asked him what they were and he told me he has depression. He smokes weed daily and drinks on a regular-ish basis. Talking to him about delicate topics like these and getting him to open up is very hard. Whenever I try to talk, he’ll quickly change the topic and make it seem like he’s doing fine.

We’ve been separated for a few months until now because I moved back to the city where we’re both originally from and our friendship has definitely drifted and changed, which makes it even harder to talk about deeper topics. 

Thankfully, I’ve never had to deal with depression so close to home until now, and I don’t know how to go about it. I appreciate any advice and personal experiences that could help me help my friend.",02Oct2019,1
30,"Yelling again 
I’m sitting, trying to have downtime for myself to escape responsibilities, by reading, tv, bathing, whatever. My mom runs in yelling at me when just earlier she was fine. Yelling about my grades. Yelling and yelling at me on my laziness and not finishing an assignment or doing bad on a test. I try. When she yells i can’t explain myself. She’s the winner. I sit there while she yells which makes her madder. But when I’m quiet she’s madder too so what’s the point. When she’s done and leaves i cry, i cry so hard and I’m sure to be quiet so she won’t hear. I’ve made the mistake of crying in front of her. Sometimes she will yell for things stupid like me not getting up early on a weekend even though I’ve always slept in on weekends. Adhd they said. Back in third grade. Drugs, pills, to try to get me to work better. Always the slowest in school. Never does homework but gets good grades. Not what is to be expected of an honors student. Once home it’s just procrastinating. I can never get myself to work even when being yelled at. I’ve tried taking my drugs again once i get home since the drugs give me motivation and consentration i wouldn’t have otherwise, despite it not helping much. I wake up often realizing i fell asleep at 6pm and its now 2, or that i haven’t eaten well in days. I guess the adhd makes me distracted from eating properly too. Others have it too and when i say I’ve got adhd they either say they think they have it because they hate school or they actually have it. And when they actually have it it’s nothing like mine. I’m a spazz. You can tell immediately there is something wrong with me and my hyper ness even with extra doses. Why are they able to work and do good and be perfect students without any drugs. My best friend with adhd and even more then that just calls me lazy. Lazy is something i hear a lot. I want to drop out of honors but my mom says I’m too smart. I may be smart at it but i can’t keep up with the extra work. I’d be all a’s if i did my work, they say it as if it would be so simple. I want someone to talk to since i don’t think i can talk to my friends about it. I was told to get a therapist after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression but that never happened.

Needless to say, I eventually realized this made no sense and I stopped having this thought. I never had an imaginary friend or anything like that.

Near the end of eighth grade, I started suspecting my clothes were smelly because my family owned cats, and that I couldn't smell it because I was used to it. In reality, my hygiene and clothes were fine. But this ruined my social life, academics, and drove me into a depression. I would turn down invitations to things, and while at school or around others, I ""knew"" they could smell me and was so embarrassed. I dropped out of soccer and band. I would note people doing things like rubbing their noses or smelling their shirts (subtle signals generally) as ""proof"" of the situation. I started having suicidal thoughts. Several times I asked friends if my house smelled weird to them (they all said no) which I took to mean they were too polite to say anything. Late junior year, I realized this wasn't actually true, and managed to rekindle some of the friendships and get into a good college. The intrusive suicidal thoughts never went away though.

In college, I managed to get a good relationship. Sometimes however, I would get the feeling (through various ""subtle signals"") that she wasn't actually interested in me. This would cause me to get performance anxiety among other things. This would happen every few months for a few weeks at a time. I eventually broke off that relationship for other reasons.

At work (software development) recently, I began to suspect my coworkers were deliberately planting code mistakes (which I am supposed to help catch) in order to frame me as a bad developer. Needless to say, this is not happening and is not something people do. I could go into more detail here, but the point is I briefly thought my co-workers, who are also my friends, were trying to get me fired in some sort of crazy conspiracy.

Im in a new relationship with someone I like a lot, and they like me, but yet again, I'm having the same issues as the first one. Every few months, for a few weeks, I think they don't actually like me in contrast to ALL the evidence.

There are 2 more I have not listed for the sake of space and I suspect there are more insane thoughts I have had, and I've just failed to identify them as such.

I recently went to the doctor to try and explain all this, but Chickened out and only discussed ""anxiety"" and lied on a form about suicidal thoughts with the rationale that I didn't take them seriously and don't want to get held at the hospital.

Does everyone get stuff like this occasionally or do I really need to go to the doctor?",02Oct2019,1
32,"I feel like as the years pass by, the more I'm convinced that maybe I am depressed, and I just never knew it because it just feels normal for me. I'm going to try to avoid writing a big block of text and just say that in my 19 years of life there was a moment where I felt very stable and genuinely happy despite life not always being rainbows. 

If I compare my life to it before and after, I almost seem like a different person cause everything was so different. I actually had confidence, I approached people  alot more openly and it felt natural, friendships felt closer, I had energy to actually to do hw early and do whatever projects I wanted to do afterwards(I actually was able to take care of myself without much issue either..), i felt everything more deeply, and maybe just enjoyed things more.. 

At that time i was 13-14 years old at the time and it was everything I ever wanted my life to be. After that everything started to slip away no matter how hard I tried to cling on. I started to become more insecure, I started to lose more energy, and I felt like my emotions became muffled. It's not like I'm numb, I still do feel different emotions but its like before I could feel 100 different shades of emotions and now I only feel like10. 

Anyways I'm trying to avoid writing love and war but I just feel like I need to talk about this. I'm almost 20 years old now, and it almost feels normal now. I still enjoy things, I still get happy about things, but it never goes to the extent it was before. My life now is like a bumpy ride but whenever i fall, I keep falling harder and harder but I do raise up, and I'm just like, ""I'm okay. I don't need any help"" 

I'm just going to end it here before I write a whole novel.",02Oct2019,1
33,"I’ve never really been one for one on one therapy, mostly due to my family’s financial situation growing up, it was mostly my schools guidance councilor who I talked to, and I wouldn’t call playing with finger puppets and playing board games therapy, this was before I was in middle school mind you, I’m not some 11th grader playing with puppets. Now I’m adulting and making my own choices for the most part, and today I talked to a trauma counselor about my suicidal ideations, since I work with them, they were thrown back and even said if it were up to them I’d be brought in to the hospital for a psych eval right then. Luckily that didn’t end up happening.

I was amazed just how much I bottled up, since I keep most of my mental health problems to myself, impostors syndrome, anxiety, and the obvious desire to kill myself were the big ones. After the talk, I still wanted to die, just not by my own hands. I wanted a bus to hit me or to get shot in an alleyway but suicide wasn’t going to be the cause. 

I’m going to start talking with someone about starting some sort of therapy or counseling, and how or if my current job will help me with all that. I’m definitely not ready for my family to find out about this.",02Oct2019,1

36,I feel like I can’t find coping methods. Whenever I feel upset anxious or stressed I always either listen to music or watch tv or movies to escape and get my mind off things. But recently I can’t even do that because everything I do weather it be listen to music or watch one of my favorite shows if always turns me to that negative mindset. It always end up just sitting until I have to leave for school or work. Is there just something I need to get over in my life or is there something I need to to action on.,02Oct2019,1
37,"My girlfriend recently started taking birth control pills (not for the purpose of birth control though, we're not sexually active; it's for treating her PCOS.) After about two weeks, she started experiencing really bad mood swings. I've seen her crying, screaming and just generally seeming miserable seemingly out of nowhere and I can't express how sorry I feel for her. 

I want to do everything I can to help, but I really don't know what I can do. She says having me around helps, but I don't think it's enough, I want to help more. But also, having to deal with her emotions all the time can be a bit much for me, especially when her mood swings make her get angry or act really mean towards me or others. 

It doesn't help that I'm also going through stuff, I was on an anti depressant (Lexapro) and starting to taper off and the withdrawal symptoms are starting to hit me. What can I do to help her but also make sure I stay okay as well in the process? 

If it makes a difference, we don't live together, I'm in my college dorm while she still lives with her parents, but we can bust to each others' places easily

38,"[TW for suicidal thoughts down below]



School has turned into a nightmarish realm for me. I know it sounds harsh but everyday I wake up and regret even existing because... I don't even fully know the reason other than just ""I hate school"". And I don't know if it's the average hatred other people have for school or not (because I've learned that my classmates often under/over exaggerate how much turmoil they're usually in) but I just wake up and I want to scream and hurt myself because I know when I go to school I'm just going to be reminded of how much of a pathetic failure I am, how useless I am, how undeserving of love and attention I am, and how I should ignore all these thoughts and hold back the constant tears because it's out of line. 

When I'm at school, everyday I feel like I'm on the edge of a mental breakdown, if I don't actually start having a mental breakdown in the middle of class that is. I'm either pitied or shamed for this it seems. I get a question wrong and all of a sudden I want to hurt myself. Violently. I want to scream and cry and run out and go home and sleep forever but I can't and I'm just not entirely sure why. I know I can end this at any time but I continue to go, and I don't know why. The future seems hopeless, and I have a bad feeling I know what's going to happen in the ""afterlife"". So why do I care so much about good grades, and why do I have to hide behind a façade whenever I fail, and pretend it doesn't hurt me as much as it actually does? My parents were never really too strict about my grades (in fact, they never really cared that much if I got an A or a D) and it seems like I'm always unsuccessful in all my classes. So why do I care so goddamn much, and why do I keep going?

I struggle deeply with math-oriented things. I'd like to think of myself as an about average intelligence person, but math has been as issue with me ever since I was in kindergarten. It's never clicked, and I don't think it will. I have issues connecting the problems with real life problems and numbers just seem like a foreign language to me (ironically, actual foreign languages are something I'm not too shabby at). I'd often fail these tests, even with help it seemed. And then there were the all-A students. I was always mocked while they were always praised. It hurt. It hurt a lot and I don't know why and I don't know what's wrong with me.

I'm also apparently a social pariah (as bitterly explained from a good selection of classmates). I'm generally described as ""nice, quiet, sweet"" but my mannerisms and way of life such as the way I dress, the way I think, and my sexuality (I live in an aggressively conservative area as an open lesbian) must put people off... not to mention the fact that stuff like this might freak them out.

It's just all this combined with the stress of home life and the stress of the past memories and the stress of the future. It's just so worthless, I just don't know what to do. I just wanna be happy.",02Oct2019,1

40,"I'm not sure I'm posting in the right subreddit, but I really need advice as it's overwhelming. This might be long and I'm on mobile so excuse formatting...

My dad has a history of paranoia and delusions, for ~3 years. He has very private conversations with people from his country (everybody knows each other, they know my mom, her family, etc). He saw a psychiatrist one time, got a diagnosis of PTSD.

My dad's mother was murdered in his home country (he was not present when it occured) and they never found out who did it, so he looks for people to blame. Since everyone knows each other, they gossip and toss blame around. And he always believes it.

The blame for the death was shifted to my mom's family. They had to move to another city and my dad actually thinks that one of them had something to do with his mom's death. So, as a result, my mom is estranged from them. She hasn't spoken to any relative in over a year. 

In general, since he thinks it was my mom's family responsible, he also blames her. They have a tense relationship, but they don't leave each other because something about keeping the (toxic) family together for the sake of me and my sisters.

One of these people decided to tell my dad that my mom's been talking shit about him. He got pissed off and started yelling at her. I didn't help at all, as I got angry and said he was being unreasonable. He gave me small pushes, which was out of the ordinary, but he's not violent.

My sister, who is more level-headed, came out and got the info that someone told my mom to poison my dad of all things!

He admitted to her that he didn't feel stable but he doesn't want any help, 'fuck doctors', etc. He won't tell us who is saying these things nor does he look like he'll cease contact.

We're concerned about his mental health and the effects it has on him and my mom. We want him to get help and support, as well as give it to him, but he's difficult and keeps saying he doesn't want help. How can we get through to him?",02Oct2019,1

The past couple weeks have been a bit emotional, i recently started talking to my mum about my anxiety/depression issues and had to talk to a doctor about it aswell so i could get sertraline, maybe that’s got something to do with it, the sertraline wouldn’t have started doing anything yet though (i started taking it the day i heard her voice)

I don’t have any family history of mental illness other than my uncle who my parents think has bi polar but he does a lot of hard drugs and he’s never been diagnosed with anything so i’m not sure if he does.

43,"I have literally no idea how this works, but my friend insists someone here might have some ideas. 

5 years ago I went to the doctor because I was exhausted. My mom told her I was having panic attacks (I didn't even know that's what those were), and the doctor said I have anxiety. This was diagnosed later by a psychiatrist as generalized anxiety disorder. A year later, the same doctor realized I have severe depression. Technically I was suicidal, turns out not wanting to put effort into saving your life if need be counts.

Went to university, got significantly worse. Summer after first year I started having hallucinations. The doctors were confused, because I was always aware that they weren't real. They thought it was a brain tumour.

I wanted it to be a tumour so bad. 

Wasn't a tumour, so they decided it was some form of psychosis. Every anti-psychotic I tried had.... horrible side effects (anti-psychotics are sedatives, not so great for someone like me turns out). 

Got kicked out of uni, ended up going to college. College psychiatrist is also a sleep doctor, bippity boppity boo turns out I have narcolepsy (something about my brain dreaming while I'm conscious causing the hallucinations), but I also have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. 

I am now on stimulants, they are the first medication I've been on that has ever actually helped. I have done CBT, I am on a wait list for DBT. I regularly see a counsellor, I eat relatively healthy, have a consistent sleep schedule, exercise as much as I can considering I'm in school full time and work part time, and have amazing supportive friends. I am seeing a doctor regularly and testing new medications, since no anti-depressant has worked in the past they are now seeing how I do on mood stabilizers (in the words of the doctor, ""this is to treat bi-polar disorder. I don't think you're bi-polar, but I'm out of ideas""). 

But I'm getting worse. I'm losing time, hours slip by and I won't even realize. I'm sleeping 12 hours again and still need multiple naps during the day. I'm terrified of everything. Feeling any kind of emotion takes so much effort it's hardly worth it. I hate myself more than I've ever hated anything in my life. I refuse to live another 60+ years like this, I won't do it.

I don't talk to my mom about it since she would enjoy what I'm doing to him. She hates him. It was a terrible divorce. I hate her for that. I dont want her to understand either. I want her to suffer emotionally too. I still love her I think.

50,"Hello,

From when I was little to around the age of 13, I had witnessed a ton of violence in my home. This was due to a lot of pressure and mental instability from a lot of family members. I saw things that scared the heck out of me as a child. It didn't help that my siblings liked pushing others under the bus, especially during times of stress.

And, though it hasn't happened at all for 3 years and everyone's gotten mentally better, I feel like it affects me a lot. Its to the point where fictional conflict, that has no bearing on my reality other than a bit of my time, it still makes me anxious and uncomfortable. My best friend loves horror and those types of stories, and I don't feel okay telling them about what happened, as I don't want them judging my family. I love my family.

51,"I recently started seeking help (3 weeks ago) after a lot of repressed memories surfaced, my physical symptoms of anxiety got significantly worse, and I felt compelled to harm myself to distract myself the emotional pain (which I acted upon for a short amount of time but have since stopped) .

The therapist I have been talking to referred me to a psychiatrist so that I could get a diagnosis and be recommended medication. Some of the difficulties that bother me are panic attacks, abnormal fears, (apparently) depression and anxiety, and compulsive desires to make certain motions. 

The therapist said that taking medication can really help me feel better and suffer less from these difficulties, and that it can help me find the strength that I need to face some of my situational difficulties without struggling with stress and anxiety about them. 

While I agree that medication could provide me with some much needed relief, I am truly scared of taking medication. In particular, I have heard of all sorts of side effects, am afraid that I will somehow become dependent on them, worry that they will somehow alter my neurochemical balance to a point at which I won’t feel like myself anymore, and am afraid that I am not giving enough time to the therapy before starting medication. 

I am also concerned that I hold some of my parents’ stigma against medication (of any kind in fact, but especially mental health) in my subconscious and am unintentionally sabotaging myself from finding the right kind of help.

I don’t have the best relationship with them and they always made it clear that I am something less than my two sisters. They never said anything but it was obvious from the way they treated (and treat) me vs how they treat them. So naturally the memories I have are not going to be very nice in a lot of cases. But I just don’t remember anything when it comes to normal interactions with them and when it was something that I had a very strong emotional response to I remember it very vaguely almost like when you are trying to remember a dream but you just remember that you had one and maybe one irrelevant detail of it but that’s it.

I was very lonely at the time so I wished that I got a boyfriend in the future and he could travel back in time to see me. By then the power got out of control and my brain was constantly wishing for terrible things I was terrified of happening like my mom dying. At times I would close my eyes and see none stop gore cause my brain wished that I would. Eventually my brain wished my future boyfriend would be stuck in the present with me. I made up dumb rules in my head like he couldn’t eat unless I left some of my food for him. I would always watch a tv show I thought he wanted to watch or listen to music he wanted to listen to. I felt like he was watching me everyday all day like he was attached to me. I started spending all day under my covers reading so he couldn’t see me. Slowly over time he started to become less and less apart of my life. I stopped leaving half my food for an imaginary person or putting on my clothes underneath a towel so he wouldn’t see me naked.

60,"I have been dealing with MDD, OCD, anxiety and PTSD basically since I was a child and around my teen years I started developing chronic pain in my joints, which I then contributed to growing pains, and an overall feeling of tiredness and exhaustion from doing basic things like walking up a single flight of stairs (I am in fairly good shape. I don’t workout or anything but I walk most places and my work keeps me moving a lot). As I grew up the pains and tiredness have only gotten worse to the point sometimes my bones feel like they are breaking or being pulled out of my skin and it’s so painful I can barley move and other times it’s just a constant dull ache. I was supposed to get bloodwork done about six months ago and I kept putting it off because the doctor told me they were almost certain I had either an auto immune disease or some kind of arthritis. I honestly did too after doing research on the symptoms and reading about others stories. Part of me almost hoped I was really sick that way I could possibly die in the least selfish way and the other part of me was terrified of getting the bloodwork done and them finding nothing. Because that’s worse than having a disease or finding out what’s wrong. I was scared that people would no longer believe me when I say I am in pain or just attribute it to something stupid like well it’s just cause you don’t work out or you eat bad (I’m no health but but I eat plenty of veggies and protein and stuff). Finally I built the courage to go and get it done after months of being pressured by my family and partner to do so. Today I got a call back and it was like I feared all clear accept a vitamin D deficiency. I’m so upset I could scream and cry.

And my friends and partner don’t understand why I’m so upset they think I should be happy that it’s just the vitamin D thing and I guess I should but it doesn’t help anything else and I just wanna cry and give up. Sorry for the rant idk if anyone will even read this I’m just so done",02Oct2019,1
61,"I guess this a vent or maybe a cry forhelp or something. I've been struggling for mental health for a couple of years now and it's just getting worse. I dont know how to feel like a regular person anymore, I dont feel real. I'm constantly stuck at the end of two extremes, feeling my emotions intensely or not feeling anything at all.  Everyday is a constant struggle not to kill myself because all I feel like is an annoyance to everyone around me and I cant seek reassurance that I'm not because that will make me even more of an annoyance. I'm also trans and that's makes things 100% more complicated and confusing,. I dont feel like a guy but i also dont always feel like a girl. I'm constantly questioning myself, just wanting to be happy and simultaneously trying to suppress it because of trauma. My anxiety is off the charts, someone cant even laugh near by me without me freaking out and having to check every aspect of what I've been doing and how I look to try and fix what i might have done and what they're not even laughing at. I recently went to my physiatrist to get my medicine updated but I lied to her about how bad I felt, how bad I want to die, and how bad my auditory hallucinations are( yeah I get those too) because I didnt want to be send to the psych ward for a being suicidal or anything. During my numb stages I just feel like my body is there but I'm not, I'm just going through the motions of life but not actually experiencing or retaining anything. I just want to be okay and not feel like this big jumble of confusion and depression. Can anyone relate to any of what I've said and maybe has some advice? Thoughts? Opinions? I'm sorry if this is a mess",02Oct2019,1
62,"I need some help figuring out what this is and why it's happening to me, can't go see a doctor or therapist because the profession I'm in won't keep people who they think are unstable up top.

Right now life seems to be in my favor, I recently kicked nicotine and stopped making a daily habit of getting drunk and I'm finally feeling like I'm improving as a person. Right now I have the girl of my dreams who I love dearly and she has motivated me to do better in college and try harder. I'm incredibly thankful for all of this. 

However, it feels like almost every day I will swing from motivated, greatful and genuinely happy to an absolute lack of motivation and happiness or vice versa. 

I love the feeling when I'm up sometimes I feel so incredibly grateful and blessed that it almost puts me on the verge of tears, I will appreciate everything around me and think about how magnificent the world I live in is, and how blessed I am to have my gf and my family, but when I fall from that mood, which can happen in just five minutes. I find myself full of self hate. I go lay in my bed and wonder if I should just lay here and starve and rot away. I lay there in the dark for hours with my eyes open just blankly staring and thinking terrible things about who I am as a person. During these down times I don't feel like doing anything, not even playing guitar which is probably my biggest passion. Sometimes I fall asleep this way, other times I'll go back up to my ""up"" state and go to sleep with a smile on my face.

It feels like lately I've had less and less of a ""normal"" state in-between these two extremes and it's starting to get really annoying.

Any clues on what this is and what I can do to fix it?",02Oct2019,1
63,"Okay, so I'm in my last year of high school and it feels like I'm drowning in all honestly.

I wake up everyday 6 am (I have a class that requires me to be there at 7 am) and I feel nothing. I feel blah, sort of why am I even going to school type of thing. 

I'm in a lot of APs and Honor classes, it's been that way since freshman year and I dont know if I cant handle it any more. Its been a month and shit keeps on getting added to my to-do list. I understand that's life but as for right now its suffocating. Many people (siblings &amp; parents) have told me to create of list of things I need to do so I can prioritize it. Because if I don't that my brain gets so jumbled I forget a lot of important things.

Like recently in my school we have a honor society for science. Everyone has to reapply even if you were into last year. I honestly misheard the dates and forgot about it for a bit for reason I'll get into later. Also, the school announcements weren't that good as well. So I didnt submit an application or do my recommendations.  The due date was the 20th, and when they asked me why I didnt submit anything, I was trying to explain it was a massive misunderstanding on my part. I thought if I'm an officer do I have to submit an application, I should have checked in with the advisers but I didn't. Which was a clear lack of judgement, I sent them a sincere email about how sorry I was for inconveniencing them. But I feel as if they think I'm kissing their ass and making excuses for myself. So idk if I'm in the society or not and there's an meeting for officers and idk if I should go. 
 
Now, I had a lot of shit going during the time for applications, I have a research class where I create my own research question and data. I was stressing over if my topic was feasible because I would alot of resources. So I was constantly checking on that. Plus I was going my Questbridge thing (huge scholarship that pays for tuition), so I was 100% focused on that. So everything else kinda became unimportant. I didnt mean not to submit an application. Also, I'm struggling in my AP Bio because I basically have to teach myself. My teacher, though sweet, doesn't teach at all. She barely has notes which is a 15 slide presentation with most of it being pictures. So a lot of kids are failing and shes coming after us like we cant study. What we read in the book and what she ""teaches"" doesnt correlate with the tests and quizzes. Its completely different from what we've seen, its impossible to think in her class. I'm not dropping the class but I'm having a hard time being on my game.

All this shit combined, makes feel as if the 4 years of work I put myself through means nothing. I'm never going to college and i just wasted my life away. I'm really scared that I'm not going to college. My SAT are very below what I need for the schools I want to apply to (1070 - couldn't afford a tutor and worked over the summer, I struggle in math) such as Columbia, University of Chicago, Stanford, Princeton. Yeah, I'm 10th out of 350 something kids. My GPA is a 3.59 unweighted, 3.7 weighted (GPA dropped due to academic issues I went through last year- traveled for 3 weeks to Nigeria so I was very behind when I came back). I'm in a lot of clubs, I've volunteer so much and help out when I can but rn all of that means nothing to me. I just feel as if I'm not ready to apply, I don't have to credentials I need to apply.

Idk, I'm all over place rn and usually I sit my ass down and focus but I cant do that rn. It's not in me, I feel like I'm watching my life instead of living it. Sometimes, I get sick of school for a day or 2 but rn I really want to fuck it and give up. Its draining the hell out of me, I cant breathe anymore. I have all these dreams and idk if they're even real anymore. I can't even enjoy the shit I used to enjoy anymore, I haven't actually read or written a real story in 2 years. I've lost my drive for it which really sucks. It's like once I wake up it's like shit how much time do I have to complete my work. I never have time to sit there and actually relax, it's just work, work, work. My mind is always on time, I cant relax because I feel as I'm wasting time and I get angry at myself. 

I have all this to do and it's super daunting. It all requires me to think but I'm so done with thinking. Sometimes I wish I was braindead or something so I wouldn't have to think. I really want to stare at a wall and do nothing, no work and my parents dont call me. But I can't, I get a nagging feeling about the work i could be doing. I dont know how to feel anymore, I know this is just a funk but its affecting me heavily now. I'm getting irresponsible and careless. 

For anyone who says I should talk to my parents, in my culture (Nigerian) stuff like this isnt talked about or seen as important. Mental health is in general disregarded. Also, my parents do encourage and push me on but they wouldn't understand. I do have siblings and a best friend who talk to me and they try to give me advice which is very helpful but idk it's not sticking to me. I dont think I'm depressed but it's like I'm in space and suffocating.

1. Should I tell my SNHS advisers what's gonna with me mentally with my guidance counselor or should I just leave it alone. 

2. Could I call this an Existential Crisis?

3. Can hope to know this will get better?

64,"hey,

just need to get this out there.  shits been bouncing around for too long and I just need to type it to try and maybe get sleep.

As expected, i feel extremely lost.  i don't know what i should be doing from day to day and I just feel like I'm making everything up at work.  My head is just full of this useless and totally unrelated stuff.  I say and do the dumbest stuff that I can't even explain.  Some days I wonder if things aren't fully connected.  I don't get normal day to day tasks people do and always am in amazement at people that do them.  I think of dancing, for example, and I can see different moves / things I could do, but when I try to do them, I can't make myself do them.  Simply trying fills me with such ""nope!"" that it's impossible to move past.  Not everything is this way, but life seems to have these walls i can't break down.

Work...  its a total dumpster fire that pains me everyday to be apart of.  I'm trying hard to make people's life easy by saying ""fire me because no one else will do this"" and it needs to get done.  But, the company itself is pretty much the worst example possible for anyone to be apart of.  It pains me knowing people in this company want better, people around me want better, I want better, but we can't get enough footing below us to even think of running.  

I feel like friends and family are the most important thing a person can have.  I feel like you don't really know a person unless you see them around someone.  But what if there isn't a lot of people around me?  What if those people are fake?  Some of my friends are great, but others I can't be sure of.  There are ones of enjoy spending time with, but this hasn't filled the massive loneliness that i've started feeling in recent years.  Getting sadly close to 10 years since a real relationship...

I can't honestly bare to talk to a group of friends I have no ability to avoid.  They're not bad people, but I am deeply starting to hate one of them due to their personal / professional attitude with me.  Knowing them in both worlds, its not a good idea.  But, as for everyone else... I feel like.. idk.  some friends I know i've pissed off, some I don't understand, and some I've pushed away.  

I know I've become more and more ranty in the last few years, no shit, i'm saying those things, but I'm trying to show that there's a problem.  I've tried explaining normally, but it doesn't seem anyone is listening.  I've only recently starting calling people out for this. (pro tip, don't)

I can't honestly say if anything I feel is real.  Some days I'm fine, some days its hell.  I've been on a couple meds recently and the one i've been on seems to work, but the lows haven't changed.  OH, I also smoke weed daily.  This isn't helpful, but sadly it seems that I've bound myself to the enjoyment I gain from it.  Seeing as I cannot make new friends, cannot get a date to save me life, or can't make it out of the house to even try, weed randomly feel into my lap.  

tl;dr, idk what to do.  am on pills, seeing a therapist every other week, no diagnostic mental health (honeslty wouldn't be surprised outside depression and adhd).  I think people in my school system thought I was ""slow""...",02Oct2019,3

I feel really numb to things anymore, I just am tired of the constant hurting from everything people have done to me. I feel so alone constantly.

69,"I will often fantasize that something cool has happened to me, not recurring just random thoughts, for example I run into the president in the store and the friend I’m with realizes I know someone famous or I do something heroic and feel worthy of recognition. 

The fantasy alone would be unproblematic but sometimes I dash off and don’t realize that this has happened until I become a little tired or bump into something. If there are people around I will realize and stop before it gets too far. If I’m in bed or seated I sometimes jump up and realize I’m about to do it and control the urge but not always.

I am now 30 and in my early 20s when I still lived at home I used to do this but nobody asked me about it except for my nephew who it weirded out. He asked “why do you just get up and run like that”?

I’ve talked to psychiatrists and psychologists about this but they seem to always brush it off and move on to other more cut and dry symptoms... They don’t seem to understand what I’m trying to explain.

Does anyone have any insight on this or at least similar behavior?",02Oct2019,4
70,"Should I be concerned about my older brother, as of recently he’s been doing things that have kinda been worrying me. First thing is a year ago we got a dog for the first time and his behavior with our pup is kinda weird like he’s super controlling over him and he’s very rough and physical with him. As a joke he filmed a Snapchat of him taking out a knife and putting it up to our dogs throat with a creepy smile on his face and sent it to my sister cause he knew she would freak out of course she did and she showed me the video. When we got mad and confronted him he just blew it off and said that we were getting way too mad over it and it was just a joke and to relax. Next thing that weirded me out is that he has a horror movie mask that he just hangs out in and wears while he plays with his knife collection I know that’s not really that serious but it just seems kinda concerning cause I feel like he enjoys it a little too much and might be fantasying about murder. Lastly is his anger issues have been getting out of control last week he got into a fight with my sister and her boyfriend, the bathroom door got broke, he punched a hole in the wall, I had to try and contain him cause he really wanted to beat the shit out of my sister boyfriend, he emotionally traumatized and physically assaulted my sister, when I was holding him down he kept screaming at the top of his lungs like someone having a psychotic rage, he looked my sister in the eyes and just screamed in her face. I was so scared I almost had to choke him out or call the cops it got that bad. My sister was so traumatized she ended up moving out the next day and she is living currently with her friend. My brother doesn’t seem to have any type of remorse about the situation only thing he’s really upset and concerned about is that she was his weed connection and now obviously he can’t get it from her so he’s all upset about that. My mom and siblings wants him to be admitted to a mental hospital now but obviously he doesn’t want to go. Can anyone give me some advice on what I can do and some advice on my brother obviously I love and care about him and I don’t want anything to happen, any advice will be greatly appreciated thanks",02Oct2019,1

72,"To preface I'm a woman in my late 20's and I've always been... a little bit peculiar. I'm not sure how much of it is the result of abusive/negligent parenting and how much of it is just my defective mental health. I'm just trying to make sense of this whole thing. I've seen a psychologist and a couple of psychiatrists and while they've diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety there are still a couple of weird variables that don't quite add up, so maybe what I'm about to write will ring a bell among you readers.

I have serious problems with authority thanks to a physically&amp;verbally abusive father but my issues have extended into adulthood. When I was a kid I was a certified Good Girl, but I transformed completely in my mid-teens and I almost got into some major trouble in high school. Suddenly during my second year of HS I got very depressed and bored. School did not interest me much at all and I went from a goody-two-shoes straight A student to making maybe mediocre to sub-mediocre grades. I was always skipping class and got into trouble for swearing and being constantly late. I was not happy and the only thing that gave me a semblance of thrill was breaking the rules - both school and societal. I had a bit of a reputation in high school, needless to say and I must've dyed my hair 15+ times before I graduated. I got called 'impulsive' at a job interview once (yikes). I think that's accurate. 

During my senior year I straightened my act a little bit and developed social anxiety seemingly out of the blue. My SA's been pestering me until now, but usually it comes back in intervals, so it comes and goes.

Made it to university by some miracle and made some pretty okay grades in my first year. Then I started to get bored and depressed again and was hit for a major bout of social anxiety and major depression two years in. Had to take a gap year to remember how to be a human being again and then I had a pretty good year in school... And then once again, was hit by depression and apathy. Could not make it to class, was too anxious to even be around campus and had a not so great year.

I just get deeply and profoundly depressed when I'm in the same environment for a long period of time - like 1.5 - 2 years or more. Be it school or work, I just cannot handle monotony. Same thing with friends - if I see the same people for a long time and nobody else but these same people, I get kinda claustrophobic, anxious and bored. My work history consists of jobs that have little to do in common; it's a mismatch of jobs in various fields. What the hell is wrong with me, is this normal or is this some form of ADD/ADHD? I hate it!

I'm not especially manic or hyper (except very occasionally) so I doubt it's manic depression, I just get desperately bored very, very quickly and once I'm bored I also get very, very depressed.

I'm just trying to figure out how to manage this thing so that I can finally get my master's degree. Therapy hasn't done much for me as of yet. Thanks in advance for your insight, guys.",02Oct2019,1

74,"So few days go I posted here about my depression and today was my first appointment with the therapist.

How was it?
I woke up at 6 am and the appointment was at 10 am.

I got up at 7.30 am from bed because i need some time to stay in my bed and do nothing.
I kissed my little sister and wish her a good morning and good day at school.
I brushed for like 10 min my teeth, i was thinking what should i tell today to my therapist? I have so much to say where should i start? Should i tell her my whole life story? Oh no that’s a lot.
My sister came to me in the bathroom and interrupt my rain of thoughts.
Everyone left and I was alone having my breakfast. 
I started to read a book(my distraction) and after few min later I checked the clock  I was already late for the appointment.
9.40 left the home and it took me 25 min to reach there.
The therapist came and she look friendly and I didn’t expect her to be my therapist because she was not wearing a white coat like others.
We did some paper works and then she said so why did you ask for the help? What was the reason?
I started to talk and after 5 min I started feeling a  lump in my throat, here we go again and I am going to cry.
I told myself not to cry because if start it’s hard for me to speak and stop tears falling. 
I talked and again and again I cried so much. 

I hated myself for not being able to stop.
The therapist let me cry and speak when I was ready and asking question when it was hard for me go forward.
She was shocked and told me to be proud of myself because I have been through a lot and still did some amazing things.

How do I feel now ?

It was first time I told someone the things from my childhood face to face and didn’t pretend to be strong. I let myself feel the pain and tell her that I am lost.
My legs and hands started to shake every time I spoke about my Dad. I never felt this way how could I be so weak? Trembling? I was used to joke on my friend shaking when she was scared.

It was already 1 hr passed and I was going to tell her some other things but I didn’t have the energy in me to tell her more. So I just stare the desk for a while. 

She smiled and said that’s okay and told me to that we will work once a time to each of the problems in next weeks.
She fixed me the next appointment and greeted.

I left the room and while going home I was thinking how is that possible. Why I wasted so many years of my life and didn’t ask for help.
Why I pretended to be someone i was not.

It’s not that all of problems will be solved just by going to a therapist but realizing that you need help and being able to ask for help is a big step.
I am not going to ever let myself down because for others I can swim the sea but for myself i feel that i am just faking or just making excuses and don’t need any help.   

Thank you for reading and i am grateful for this community to give me enough courage to take action.

I am what some people would consider “tightly wound”. I react easily and often, extremely, to situations that upset or inconvenience me. Not *every* situation but most.  
  
I make a mountain out of a molehill out of everything. I remember as far back as elementary grade school and have strong feelings of anger towards a best friend of mine for a minor “fight”.... so much so that I wanted to *physically fight her*.  
  
Growing up, I had a good childhood. My mother however, never showed emotion to us children. There were no hugs, no “I love you’s” everyday. I can’t remember her telling me “I love you” ever growing up really.  

She was very affectionate, playful, huggy and kissy &amp; constant I Love You’s all the time with my stepfather (who’s been in my life since I was 7).  

I really don’t think my mom started telling me she loved me until I moved out and went to college.  
  
She just wasn’t an affectionate mom.  I KNOW this has to have shaped or affected me into the person I am today.
  
As a result, I like affection and it comforts me, but I don't show it often, and can come off as detached and indifferent.  
  
My mom was a loner who’s life was about her family and husband. She had no friends and was absolutely fine that way.  
I was incredibly social in college but for the last few years, I’ve been declining nearly all invitations for any type of social gatherings and I don’t enjoy being around people. It feels forced.  
  
I’m not depressed. I don’t feel sad or avoid leaving my house. I come to work, go home, or shop and am content.  
  
I don’t think I have anxiety....although my anger and overreactions to situations cause myself stress.

The first episode had a trigger warning that I ignored, which I ended up regretting. The TW wasn't specific. It basically said that if you have mental health issues, you shouldn't watch it. And it was only on the first episode. But I watched it anyway and although it threw me off, I continued to watch the show. 

Spoiler alert but not a spoiler alert, a person dies. They kill themself and it's something that is addressed throughout the rest of the show.

The person also explained that they feel everything and there wasn't enough positive emotion to balance out the bad things they felt. Sounds like an empath.

I have a history of getting too emotional over things that have nothing to do with me. I absorb everything around me, whether it be from literature, TV shows, movies, or real people in my surroundings. I feel all of it. Sometimes I lose my sense of self because of how much I absorb. I just feel too much. My dad often points out that I shouldn't get so sad over fictional things but I think about how stuff like that happens in the real world and it messes me up. And sometimes it's simply me taking in too much of something that didn't happen in real life. I just get too sad. 

Yes, I know that what I saw in the episode is a story that was made up for a character but it is something that I feel. I absorb too much and it's hard to peel away from it all and try to be happy. One thing to also note is that this is only one of my issues. It's just something I was able to pinpoint in this moment",02Oct2019,1
83,"Up until grade 3, I had a pretty ordinary childhood. I am by nature introverted and a bit quiet. In my first school, I was a slow learner and fell behind the other kids. At age 8, I went to elementary school (grades 3-6). 

Unfortunately, kids from several schools were merged together into this school, and I ended up in a class with a bully and several of his friends. It didn’t take them very long to figure out that I was shy, and not very proficient at defending myself.

It started out with constant name-calling and taunting by this “clique” of bullies. The teachers saw what was going on, and didn’t do anything about it. 

As a shy kid, I found it hard to defend myself, and so the bullies moved things up a notch. They started making up rumors and stories about me and gossiping to everyone who would listen. As a result, all the other kids started to avoid me, and I lost all the friends that I had.

Soon after, it became a popular activity to join in on the harassment, to the point where virtually all the kids my age were joining in on the bullying. 

My parents didn’t understand either. I remember coming home from school crying every day, and I’d tell them what had happened. They’d give me the “stiff upper lip” line, and tell me to face my bullies. 

I don’t think they realized the extent of the bullying and didn’t think they needed to do anything about it. Society seems to have this idea that boys are supposed to be strong and “macho”, and fight their way out of their problems. Quite frankly, fighting was the last thing I wanted. I just wanted the bullying to stop!

85,"hi, i was wondering if anyone could give any insight into the questions an application form for psychotherapy is asking me. obviously im not asking you guys to tell me what to say or what the 'right answer' is, just a little bit of insight into what you think the questions want.

&amp;#x200B;

context: its an application form for psychotherapy, I have to fill it in and email it back to them before I can have an initial meeting. there are a few admin qs like name, age, etc. but there are a couple of questions like:  
 'describe your childhood and the people you grew up around, including any changes/separations you experienced'.  
I'm worried that filling this part in 'badly' might affect the likelihood of me getting an appointment. I find it hard to judge how much depth is necessary. I imagine they are looking for details like loss of a parent or divorce, but ive experienced neither. if i have to give some insight into stuff that may have affected me growing up id have to dive much deeper into specific habits/traits of my parents, etc., which I find hard to believe they want at such an initial stage?  


also, the last question basically says 'describe anything else you think is relevant but this form hasnt covered'. i have no idea what to say :( i could talk about so many things, but theyre all small little pieces. Im worried that any one thing i mention will be picked out and characterise their entire view of what i need

Tried searching for similar posts beforehand but couldn’t find anything quite the same.
Tldr at the bottom

I mean if I’m out in public and am wearing something smart, for example for work, I assume everyone I pass by will think I’m a snob or may make a comment or even decide to confront me, I know that sounds ridiculous as I can never imagine that happening to anyone else. In fact I could see people daily dressed in full suits or others in just a track suit and never even register it or care enough to think about someone else’s outfit choice as it has no impact on my life, but then when I walk by wearing a similar thing I feel like I see some people glancing and I get tense walking past them with my first thought being that they will say something or at least that they’re thinking something negative and judging me.

If I’m with my girlfriend I get the same thoughts but much more intense, even fearing stupid things like what if someone decides to physically confront me and how would I have to react and what if something happens to her and my brain just goes into overdrive. It doesn’t matter whether we’re just out in shops, cinema or at a bar. As I have a full sleeve I’ve even started often just wearing T-shirt’s out regardless of weather because my brain justifies it as a slight deterrent for others to interact with me as I may come across ‘tougher’ or something which sounds embarrassing to even type out. 
I think this whole feeling became even worse after one night in a bar some drunk twat randomly came up to me while we were sitting down in a group of people completely unprovoked to slap me in the face.

I completely understood my thoughts before were somewhat irrational and I just had some spotlight effect but this felt like it just confirmed my absolute mistrust for people around me. I still try to go out with everyone as I don’t want to miss out or let anyone down but honestly for the last couple of years I absolutely dreaded the idea of going out anywhere especially bars and places like that every time it comes up, which I get annoyed at at myself, because while people are looking forward to events which are meant to be fun and positive, I spend the week wishing they would just be over with and over analysing everything that could happen beforehand.

TLDR; think everyone will judge me for what I wear and how I look and in a somewhat related way have a constant fear someone will confront me verbally or physically or decide to randomly assault me or pick a fight for no reason",02Oct2019,1

94,"I have been going through a very rough patch lately, now it has been even harder due to a bad breakup and a five year long love story that is not over yet. I have had lots of circumstances in my life which have fundamentally changed me. One close relative died out of the blue and very young. Both my parents have fallen ill with chronic illnesses that have changed our family dinamic. I haven't been able to find a job for years after I graduated university, even now, I have a part time job which is not badly payed, but it definitely has nothing to do with my field and is not the most motivating thing for me to do. Also, my ""field"" is just something that has casually landed on my life. I have never felt like I had a vocation or a desire to do anything in particular.

Lately I have just been feeling terrible all around. My anxiety, which I already take some medication for, has been through the roof. I feel like doing absolutely nothing. I can barely concentrate in things that should not take a lot of concentration. I don't enjoy any of the things I used to do and don't feel any desire to do any of those hobbies. I sleep very poorly. I have pain in multiple parts of my body due to the anxiety I feel. Most of the time, I've been thinking about my ex/now wanna be boyfriend again. I don't trust myself with anything. I feel either jittery or completely slowed down. I need to do some academic work to get my degree, time is kind of running out for that, but I am unable to get myself to doing anything useful. 

I am able to pretend I am not wrong, though. I can pretend in front of my parents I feel better than I do, I really don't want them to hurt or worry too much about me. I am also able to function well at my job although I simply feel numb all the time. 

English is not my first language, but I am a decent writer and my English is fucking great. But this post is a whole nonsensical mess. I don't even think I'm being able to get my point across.

Could this be depression?",02Oct2019,1
95,"Over the last few weeks of my life, I really began questioning myself. A few months ago, I suddenly realized I could never be together with my crush, which left me in constant emptiness and pain. About two months ago, I searched for the symptoms and found out it could lead to a depression, which honestly fit very well. I know I shouldn't self-diagnose, but I atleast want an idea of what is going on inside me. Much things reinforced this, like perfectionism, worthlessness, some sadness, adhd in childhood etc. . But the feeling of being depressed wasn't there, because i also had often a state of being ok or actually happy, just some reoccuring depressing thoughts a few times a day. I refused to believe it with one part, while the other says I am not ok. 

I became more and more aware that something isn't right. I always have a neutral, judging perspective in my mind and always disagree with myself. I always was deperate and needing attention, never could really handle rejection or being alone, and quickly trusted someone with intimate details. And, I forgot my personality. I don't know who I am. If I want to find out, there is just emptiness. The more I search, the less I find. I could literally switch between being any person to another(or atleast pretend to). I also was pretty moody and had problems with extreme anger, especially earlier in childhood. I dissociate if something bad happens, and think suicide is not that bad and more of a simple way out. I always research what it is, but I don't seem to find out what could be the reason. Im not able to go see a doctor because of my parents. They are really nice, but accidentally messed some things up like my coordination and they would blame themself and have no clue what to do and are generally pretty emotionally labil. I don't want to make them have to experience that. Maybe it's just because I'm 15 yo and it's standard. Atleast I know how to play ok. The most pathetic thing is, that I do post after post about my problems, maybe because of attention or desperation or both.

103,"My story- Get ready...

It is hard to believe that I am the same person as that child. I’ve gotten great at disassociation over the years. I vividly remember myself as a soul or a consciousness- but the body and mind were never ‘one’. Kind of like being stuck in a shell; one existed inside the other. Becoming familiar with my character has been a huge part of my recent self-awareness journey… but becoming self-aware of my body may be JUST as vital. By merging body and mind, I believe I will be able to shift from victim mode to survival mode, which is imperative for my own self-actualization. My initial inclination is always to share my experiences with as many people as possible, but I’ve held back a whole hell of a lot in the past. Mostly out of fear of judgement. The most recent promise I have made for myself, (which is also probably the largest act of self-love I’ve EVER committed to), is to allow myself to be who I really want to be. Whether that means I over-share on social media, dress like a tie-dye cowboy, or make weird and slightly scary artwork. I will strive to no longer suppress myself. 

For my whole life, I’ve felt like I have been hiding a huge secret. Keeping that secret hidden has been the bane of my existence and it is prevalent in my earliest memories. The only life I know, is a life where you allow a secret to eat away at you. I’ve never been free, but I’m setting myself free now by sharing my story. 

My childhood consists of many memories of my grandparents’ house. My sister and I would spend a lot of time there while my parents were at work. I distinctly remember my grandpaw being my favorite person back then. I remember holding hands with him as we walking around their huge woody backyard. He gave me gifts, from jelly beans, to harmonicas, to paper weights, and 2 dollar bills. He let me play with his ukulele and pretend to use his video camera. He showed me The Beatles and Janis Joplin. He would fix me my favorite meal- which was sardines and tomato soup. (I was a strange child, ok) 
All of those memories seem normal and happy on the surface- but they are rooted in so much darkness and ill-intent. Those cheerful memories were intentionally put there by him to cloud my child mind from realizing what his true intentions were. I was being groomed for something sickening. 

My grandpaw raped and molested me from age 3 to about 8 years old. The memories I have are extremely fleeting, jumbled, fuzzy… except for one. The memory that has stuck with me vividly is the memory that has haunted me for me entire life. My grandpaw made my sister and I perform oral sex on him. I’ll spare you from the details, but this memory is engrained in to my brain. My sister and I were around the ages of 8 and 7, but honestly- it is hard for me to be sure. 

It gets more screwed up from here. I remember being in the backseat of my mom’s car that same afternoon. My grandpaw made my sister and I promise not to tell anyone anything or something terrible would happen. I was already well versed on how to keep his secrets, and I was loyal to him. My sister, on the other hand, was not. The very first thing she did once we got in to that car was tell my mother “Guess what we did with Grandpaw?!” She was legitimately excited to tell my mom. She didn’t understand. It gets extremely fuzzy for me from here on out. I do remember my mom crying, though. I also remember myself going mute and not wanting to admit to my mom what had happened. I was so angry my sister made the secret known. 

Fast forward- and my grandpaw was arrested. My dad was a cop, so he was the one that arrested him. I’m not really aware on much of the details- but all he got was house arrest. The charge he got was somehow much less than what he should’ve gotten. It is because my grandmaw threatened to disown my mother if my dad arrested him for the full charge. Because it would ‘destroy’ their prestigious careers. I’m guessing my mom convinced my father. I’m not really sure, though. My grandmaw actually did end up not speaking to us for over a year. Apparently, she screamed in to my sister’s face saying that we were lying and to stop making stuff up. I don’t really remember this- as I have gotten extremely good at blocking things out. 

You would think that we would have nothing to do with him anymore afterwards- but oh no, he stuck around. My family basically all acted as if it NEVER happened. I remember being brought to a child therapist for one, maybe two visits? Apparently, the therapist told my mom that my sister and I didn’t remember anything. Which was definitely not true. I still held on to that secret and kept it so close. I was determined to keep it hidden. My family then never brought it up again, and continued to bring us around him as if nothing had ever happened. It was incredibly confusing- I cannot even begin to explain it. I got used to being around him. I remember being around him when he still had his house arrest anklet on. After my parents got divorced, we moved in to that same house where all of the abuse occurred in. My brain did an amazing job at protecting me, and blocked a lot of that out for a very long time. It was such a strange experience- I always knew something was wrong deep, deep down- but it was so clouded and hidden. 

Of course, this incident has caused me so much pain throughout my life and completely shaped me in to who I am now. A year ago, I decided to go to therapy to finally better myself and sort through my issues. My initial intention with therapy had nothing to do with the abuse. It was still very repressed. I just knew I needed help and I didn’t really understand why. After a few months of weekly visits, I told my therapist. Her reaction made it real for me. I never realized how messed up it all really is. She made me realize that it wasn’t okay, and that I needed to work through it. We decided to try EDMR therapy. 

I never knew the true power of the brain until EDMR therapy. Memory and trauma and CPTSD are insane things…I’m still learning and coming to terms with it all. During every EDMR session, I began to remember more and more traumatic memories from that abuse. It was SO much more than what I was consciously aware of. I kept getting flashes of a shed, or an abandoned house, of repeated penetration, of being held down, of disassociating and staring outside of the window while it happened- day dreaming it all away. There were flashbacks of him exposing himself to me over the course of years, of touching me, of him making me touch him, of him filming me on his video camera he let me play with. He would walk with me out in to the woody back yard to take me to a shed to rape me. I went most of my life NEVER being aware of this due to disassociation and repression due to trauma. I am still in the stage where I don’t believe myself because it seems incredible insane and deceiving. But I know that it is what I needed to do to survive through it all. 

A lot of things throughout my childhood has started to make so much sense after being made aware of the entire situation. One of my biggest struggles was encopresis- or withholding going to the bathroom. I remember being legitimately scared to defecate, and I would go weeks and weeks without doing so. I would make myself so sick that my parents would reward me with Chuckie Cheeses or a new toy once I finally went to the restroom. I would sit on the toilet and just cry and cry and cry not knowing why I was like this. I was brought to the doctor over and over, and even to the hospital on numerous occasions to try and figure out what was going on with my body. They never found anything. Now, I am aware that this is a huge symptom of childhood sexual abuse. I also would go frequent UTI’s and I remember having to go to the ER on numerous occasions because I was bleeding from “down there”. Those two things were big validations for me. 

This incident has destroyed me, yet also made me who I am. My family kept bringing us around him. We would go over there for every holiday, vacation, etc. The smell of him and his cigarettes has always made me sick. I thought it must have A) never happened or B) wasn’t that big of a deal because my parents did nothing to protect me. Not once was I truly believed. Not once did I get any sort of justice that I deserve.",02Oct2019,2

Not painful but just a very intense pressure. 

Depending on how much I feel withdrawn from everything, I struggle a lot to concentrate on anything and I get quite confused sometimes. Having a normal conversation is a struggle without seeming spaced out.

I don’t want to work with a student or low-cost clinic because I’ve tried it in the past and it didn’t go well for me. The crisis a student or low-cost provider will inevitably create will probably make for a pretty miserable death. To me, if that’s my only available option, then why not do suicide the slow and gentle way instead of waiting for the next crisis? 

If I can’t work with someone established, who I feel safe with, then why am I supposed to keep trying? Why am I not allowed to die on my terms? I’m really not looking forward to it, but it seems better than the alternative. Why is it is illegal? I don’t get it.",02Oct2019,1
113,"Embrace the Struggle

For as long as I could remember I have shied away from struggle. I came from a family who did so much for me.. Too much for me and this subconsciously created an entitled mentality. From an early age I began finding short cuts, the path with least resistance and quite frankly ran away from any struggles. 

I was the kid who copied others homework, copied on tests, did the bare minimum on all group projects and used others to my advantage. I was a selfish kid who was very ego driven. I always lived in fear. Mostly fear of judgement and fear of failure. Therefor I very rarely left my comfort zone, always focusing on my strengths and never my weaknesses in fear of not being ""good enough"". 

I have recently changed my mindset and I now see the growth that comes from the struggle. I see the growth that comes from failure. I see the growth that occurs when you put your ego aside and step outside of your comfort zone.

I want everyone who is struggling right now to know that it is happening for a reason. This is an opportunity to overcome this struggle and become a better version of yourself. The more struggles we overcome, the more failures we have, and the more we step outside of our comfort zones the stronger we become. No growth occurs living in fear and remaining comfortable. Go out, be fearless and live your best life because YOU deserve it.

During her attack, she doesn't like to talk to me with normal or video call because she doesn't want me to look at her while crying. But she wants me to keep texting her not to feel alone. I'm ok with that and I'm sure in the future she will be more comfortable with me.

The problem starts when I have no clue how to help her. I am experiencing panic attacks too, but I want to be alone with none around. She is the opposite. Also she starts to get very angry and upset when the panic attack happens. But when she calms down, she tells me how wrong is was she was yelling at me and that's not her self.

I'm very calm as a person but I think this constant aggressive behavior will result to a very toxic relationship in the future even if this is not her ""real self"".

I always have in mind that during a new relationship, every issue you have in the beginning will either disappear or become way way worse in the future. In my case this is toxic behavior. Even if this not her normal state, it will tear me down in the future.

116,"For the past two-ish years I feel like the government or some secret society or something is hypnotizing me and controlling my mind. I feel like they are doing so subliminally through colors, sounds, shapes, symbols, chemicals, logos, and the media. I feel this way because I have been so out of touch with everything lately and having the worst luck ever. What is sooo funny about this is that right before this started happening, it was the complete opposite. I was with it. I had a power intuition and would figure everything out. I was able to crack the code in everything and find shortcuts and memorize all these things and I was very creative too. I was able to predict everything and everything went perfectly and it was like I was in control of the universe. I feel like that took a 180 when some secret organization found out how much power my mind had and decided to mentally punish me for it. It completely switched. Everything became out of place and unpredictable. I started to become less creative and more confused. And I feel like all the mental illnesses I suddenly have were put into my mind by these organizations to torture me. My two theories on why this is are: this organization that is mentally torturing me is sadistic OR they are punishing me for having had a strong mind before. I know this sounds crazy but it’s how I feel",02Oct2019,2
117,"So I’m a 2nd year uni student who had a test the other day that didn’t go as well as planned. It was in a subject that I felt very confident in and in which I rarely made mistakes, so I decided not to revise as much as I usually would have (I was also in a very apathetic mood over the weekend due to having gone thru a bit of emotional turmoil earlier in the week). However, the test ended up being a bit harder than I’d expected and made me realise that I should have worked on some particular problem areas a bit more.

Cut to 2 days later and I’m still constantly ruminating, counting the mistakes I made and, worst of all, cursing myself out over and over again for not trying hard enough. I’m usually an extremely hardworking student and I’d been working pretty hard this semester up until the weekend, so i just can’t forgive myself for suddenly getting complacent before a test that counts toward my final grade. I can’t even just tell myself to learn from it and move on because I made pretty much the same mistake last year!

On top of all this, I keep feeling that the fact that I didn’t try hard enough in this means that I shouldn’t bother trying hard in my other subjects and that I don’t deserve to enjoy my subject, because I have to keep punishing myself by thinking about my mistakes.

 Please could someone give me some advice on how to get over this or even just assure me that I’m not as lazy and worthless as I feel right now? 

Tl;dr: I can’t stop punishing myself for not revising enough for a test and I’m barely holding it together, help!!",02Oct2019,1

I saw it a couple of nights ago on my ceiling. It startles me to where I jump but I don’t get scared. When I see it there is nothing going on, just a regular day in my apartment. I told my psychologist about it and she told me to journal about when I saw it, the time, and how I was feeling at the time I saw it.

Basically I've been at work today and I had a list of things I was supposed to do (I work at a grocery store) and I haven't gotten any of it done because I have been hyper focused on rearranging this one 20 foot section of an aisle. Just to reiterate this was not part of my instructions for the day. I have spent the past 4 hours arranging and rearranging this shelf. and every time I did it ""wrong"" or didnt follow my own rules for how I wanted to do it, I started over. I've had these kinds of hyper fixations before, usually revolving around some kind of organization task or something similar that I make needlessly complicated for myself, but it's never affected my job/life like it is today.  I've tried multiple times to walk away and do the things I'm supposed to do, but I keep coming back to this stupid shelf. I should mention that I have major depression and  moderate anxiety and a tendency towards racing thoughts. Am I reading too deep into this or should I be concerned?",02Oct2019,2
121,"So recently I've been on a bad streak of emotional turmoil and was working on ways to make my mood a bit better as I still consider myself an old fashion man. Bottle up the feelings, hide emotions, deal with it myself etc. Type of guy.

But after a nice trip to Paris with my Mom and having wonderfull conversations I felt good and happy. That was supposed to be the distraction and the cure for my blues.

But on my drive home from the airport this thought popped into my head. I don't actually want anything anymore. And that though felt like the most genuine I have been with myself in ages and that though just broke me and scared me to a whole new sense of terror. And I just had to stop and cry for a long time till I got myself together.

Am I on a brink of something here? I Never felt this way before it's scary as I felt that I lost grip on my own emotional state.

122,"I'll give a little bit of background information. My father is a paranoid schizophrenic. My whole life he was always consumed in worrying about if people liked him. If someone unfriended him on Facebook he would fall apart. He also has severe anxiety and OCD. I've been seeing subtle paranoid thoughts/actions from him for years, but last year was when it got bad. He became completely delusional and he's been in and out of hospitals numerous times ever since.

Now I'm a sophomore in college and thing's aren't exactly going smoothly for me. My roommate and I are not getting along, and the more I get to know her, the more conniving I'm realizing she is. She gossips quite a lot, and is very spiteful. I recently asked her if we could sleep with the lights off, and I've been getting the cold shoulder ever since. 

Anyways, her older sister is in a sorority, and she's also the mean girl type. At the same time, I'm going through some sort of a breakup. I don't know if that's what you would specifically call it, because we never defined the relationship, but he's basically ghosting me in a rather abrupt manner. It's taking a toll on me because I'm severely codependent and I have attachment/abandonment issues. 

This is where the paranoid thoughts come in. My mind has made a scenario where my roommate, or her sister, has talked to this guy and ultimately told him enough lies to sabotage the relationship. Now I'm here. I'm paralyzed in bed, my heart is beating out of my chest and I can't even cry. I know if I reach out I'm going to sound crazy. So I'm confining the crazy to my head, and well, I guess Reddit now too. I just don't know what to do and I'm freaking out.

For 3 years now, I haven't had a single friend. I know it sounds overly dramatic and a little silly to say it like that. But it's a large part of why I'm suicidal.

Every day im alone, apart from the occasional shopkeeper, colleague, or person from my course no body speaks to me or notices me. It's as though I dont exist. 

I listen to podcasts, as I start having panic attacks because of the silence. It's hard to explain. But the intense feeling of lonliness slowly builds over the years; and I cant take it anymore.

It isnt just a case of ""go out and meet people"". I've tried. Again and again. But I'm not someone that people like. I'm strange, awkward, anxious, and dont really have anything going for me. Try as I might, people seem to drift away. Just this week I went to 2 events to meet people, by the end of those evenings I was by my self whilst everyone else talked to everyone except me.

135,"For example, I've been watching Brooklyn 99 and I know I find it funny and I really like watching it but my reaction to the comedy is just nothing. I'm constantly flat and watching Brooklyn 99 has made me realise this. I don't laugh, I just stare at the TV watching it. I probably look really weird if someone could see me. 

It's the same with YouTube videos that I've watched many times in the past and I always found them hilarious, I rewatch them to have a laugh and because I love them but now I'm just not getting that feeling anymore. I constantly watch nerdcubed (you should check him out if you don't know him) I know I love him and his content but even this doesn't bring me joy anymore. His videos saved my life in my darkest times and when I finally met him 2 weeks ago I told him how much he's helped me, I was so happy that I met him but it still didn't bring me joy. 

I don't know how else to explain it besides ""flat"". 

I keep making really dark jokes at work about wanting to die and I'm not usually like that. Deep down inside I know I want to die but I don't want to commit suicide and I'm just pushing the fact I want to die onto my colleagues and friends in the form of dark humour and I don't want to do that but for some reason I can't help it. 

I feel bad for my colleagues having to suffer from me constantly joking around saying I want to die then asking if that joke was too dark. 

I can't find happiness in anything anymore. I have my dream job with amazing colleagues that I'm proud to call my family but even my job doesn't make me happy. 

I'm just constantly numb to things that should make me hapoy and I'm miserable. 

I think it's my antidepressants causing this since they've upped my dose a few months ago but every time I talk to my doctor's they're very reluctant to change them. I'm on the highest dose of mirtazapine they can give me. 

I just don't know what to do. I do what makes me happy but I literally can't feel happiness anymore. I think I'll try to get another doctors appointment this week to talk to them because I don't know what to do and I don't want to be like this, it's affecting my work quality and also affecting my relationships with my colleagues.

138,"how i got to this point.... 
i used to be a depressed, lonely, and kind of suicidal person with no drive, no ambition, no feelings of any kind besides self hatred and self pity. that was who i was my entire life until i met my boyfriend. he put my broken pieces back together and he has made me so happy and feel so loved since we met 4 years ago, when i was a junior in high school.

so now... i’m 20 yrs old i’d say i have a pretty “good life”, materialistically/romantically speaking. 

- i have a boyfriend that loves me and would do literally anything for me. he supports me entirely. financially, emotionally... everything. gets me whatever i want, does whatever i need, and i appreciate him and love him so much. i don’t take advantage of him. i love him. 
we don’t live together yet because i don’t have a job.
- i live with my parents. they have been super lenient with me not working or going to school for 2 years since i graduated high school. i am always helping around the house and with my two little sisters. my boyfriend gives me money to help them pay for bills and pay my own bills. but now they are getting sick of it and want me to do something with my life. my dad has never believed in me and has always favored my older brother who is 3 yrs older than me, unemployed,  doesn’t help around the house, is a mean person and plays video games in the basement all day and night. but my parents don’t say much to him.
i actually take it as a compliment... like maybe they expect more from me. like they know i have more potential than what i currently doing. 
my dad said i’m a lazy loser. 
“don’t you wanna do something with your life? make something of yourself? what’s wrong with you? if i were young like you, i’d be doing this, doing that, not wasting away like you are.”

but the problem is:
i literally don’t want to do anything I DO but i feel like i can’t. like i’m destined to be a failure. i cant muster it inside myself to sign up for financial aid so i can take classes at the tech college. thinking about going to work and socializing with people besides my boyfriend makes me so fuzzy in my brain. there are too many scenarios that i can think of- like saying the wrong thing or messing up or embarrassing myself. i don’t want to work. i don’t want to go to school. i don’t want to do anything where i have to talk to people. but it’s a part of life. it’s not right that i get to stay home and do nothing and be taken care of financially when others have to work for it. 
i’m always sad about nothing but sad about everything. i cry myself to sleep once or twice a week for no reason. 

but I WANT TO WORK! I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING OF MYSELF! but my brain gets so fuzzy and sad when i think about all the ways i can fail. i get terrible anxiety. maybe that’s it?? maybe i just need meds for it and i’ll be better? 
i am MISSING a sense of accomplishment and structure in my life. but it’s just so hard for me to DO things and i don’t know why. i’m about to cry right now, thinking about how stupid this is. 

what do you think my problem is? am i simply an immature coward? am i simply a lazy and spoiled brat? i need to hear what needs to be said. 
someone please help me. i’m too shy to see a therapist. i just want to hear the blunt reality of whats happening to me/what i’m doing to myself.",02Oct2019,1

So, I’m 17 and am just very unhappy with life. Since I was 12 years old I’ve been suicidal and I keep telling myself that it will get better, but it’s been almost 6 years now and I only see it getting worse. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I have an extreme difficulty expressing my emotions to anyone. Naturally I’m very introverted but I am trying to talk to other people because I cannot keep going without human interaction. It makes me so sad and depressed when I see everyone talking to friends, family, etc. so openly and freely because it comes so natural to them. I want to be able to talk and feel like that so bad but I don’t have anyone. I don’t feel comfortable talking with my friends about anything personal because whenever I bring up something even remotely close to me being suicidal they just kind of act awkward and don’t seem comfortable whatsoever talking about it so I don’t want to burden them. I have felt like this for so long and no matter how much I try to be optimistic life just keeps on catching up with me. I have continuously tried to put how I feel to the side but I know this just makes it worse and it has. I don’t know what to do. I want to kill myself because I am tired of waking up every morning knowing that the day will be like all the rest; no matter how much I tell myself and genuinely try to convince myself that life is worth living so I can see what the future holds my suicidal thoughts that bring me back to reality keep on coming at me. I can never seem to focus on the positive for my own good; to others, I am very optimistic and to myself I try and try but I can never hold it; it’s like I am building up all of my emotions and suicidal thoughts.

Even though that above is the main issue, the fact that I have anxiety and depression isn’t helping either. I have tried to talk to people so many times and I believe that I need someone who I can trust, so I want a relationship so desperately so I can be with someone to commit and be committed to, but every girl that I’ve asked since the 5th grade has said no (except for one, which tried to convince me to kill myself by telling me things like “You should know that no one would care about you you just should kill yourself no one will care you aren’t worth it,” and much other words to me whenever we would get into an argument because she knew that I was sensitive on the topic of me being suicidal so it would always get at me. Another girl I dated directly after he cheated on me 5 different times in the 3 months we were together, and every girl has said no since).

I don’t know what to do. I want to kill myself so bad to free me from all problems and all burdens that I cause people just by being around and being an obvious third wheel in a normal friendship; I never feel important and I haven’t for coming on six years.",02Oct2019,1

School has made me very angry, anxious, and I tend to lash out at people when approached. Thanks to school, my life has been devoid of meaning to the point where I accepted that I fell in love with the idea of death. Death seems so peaceful. Though a dead man is never happy, a dead person is never sad. Is happiness a lack of sadness? If that is the case, then dead is the happiest most peaceful state a person can be in. This may sound strange, but I would not kill myself. It's more like I would accept my situation if I was dying.

146,"My best friend ever is a major hypochondriac, and it seriously debilitates his life. He's dropped out of semesters under the notion he was sick with some horrible disease when he wasn't. Any time he gets a cold, stomach ache, or nausea he thinks it's world ending. Everyone experiences discomfort in their body from something as simple as too much cheese or not enough water and typically we just eat less cheese or have more water. To him, a mild discomfort is a precursor to cancer and he will stop being productive for weeks and stop socializing for weeks because a stomach virus gives him so much anxiety it makes him sicker and he just disappears from the world.

My friend is a very reasonable guy until his health anxiety comes in to play. I dont know how to help him anymore, and I think about him a lot because his health anxiety debilitates him. He started an anti depressant and got nauseated, which is typical (refuses to tell me what the medicine is called), and is already in a realm of doom and gloom relating this nausea to something threatening or concerning.

I'm going insane. My typically reasonable friend will not listen to reason and it feels way beyond anything I can help with. For almost a year and a half hes had very intense health anxiety. He could have a headache one day and he'll think about it a week to follow.

149,"**Long read. TLDR at the end, although the details are important.**

I have always had problems with procrastination, difficulty focusing and sustaining attention on a task, poor impulse-control (overreating, skipping class, doing things I know will cause problems for myself but am too mentally weak to stop myself from doing them), lack of motivation, lack of mental energy, extreme aversion to doing something that I know will be mentally taxing, bad memory, inability to follow a routine, etc. I also tend to daydream a lot, zone out when someone is talking to me and have to ask them to repeat what they're saying, get easily distracted when driving with someone in the car or when driving alone and get lost in my thoughts (resulting in me getting lost), and am really bad at remembering names. I never thought this was too much of an issue, but I wanted to mention it because I've seen these types of symptoms be associated with ADHD.

Now, that's not to say that this is always the case. Sometimes I will get very intensely interested in something to the point where I am very focused on it and it is all I can think about. Lately it has been learning everything about every programming language I can (am a Computer Science major). However, a lot of this ends up being me fantasizing and meticulously planning what I am going to be doing in my head, but then barely following through. I will often get started on my goals, like this, be very diligent with them for a while, and then slowly lose interest.

I have found accidentally that drugs like caffeine, specifically caffeine mixed with L-Theanine, either in the form of black tea or caffeine-l-theanine pills, often fix a lot of these problems. For whatever reason I am much more sensitive to their effects than pretty much everyone I know. They will give me energy, make me much more motivated, process everything faster, more focused and disciplined, and generally better all around. However, I tend to build up a tolerance to them quickly, and as I do, my issues return and I end up taking more and more to get the same effects, which ends up interfering with my sleep and causing sleep deprivation that masks the positive effects. I usually also end up eating a far worse diet when this happens because the carb high seems to complement the effects of the caffeine, and also help me sleep at night. It's also worth nothing that I have had periods where I've experimented with other substances like Cholinergic nootropic drugs (specifically Racetams) to help my cognition, however I end up spending so much time researching them, thinking about my doses, and meticulously weighing and portioning them that it kills the extra productivity I'm supposed to be getting. All this usually comes to a boiling point (such as right now) where I feel so unhealthy and realize that everything I'm trying to do to help my problems just makes them worse in the long run, and vow to change my life completely. Get rid of caffeine in its entirety, eat a very strictly healthy, Mediterranean diet, exercise on a regular basis, and be as focused and disciplined as I can. One of two things happen when I attempt this. Either I give up pretty quickly due to the extreme uptick in my mental problems, along with some added depression related to carb/caffeine withdrawal, or I tough it out and actually make good changes for a while. However, after a few weeks at the MOST, I end up going right back into my bad habits. This is an endless cycle and it seems to be getting much worse and causing serious problems in my life.

Now, I've always seen this as a behavioral/lifestyle problem that has just compounded due to me having bad habits. But when I look back, I've honestly had this problem ever since 4th grade. In fact, I can identify when this all started in 4th grade when I suddenly started to get extreme aversion to homework and decided to just stop doing my homework, resulting in serious punishment from my parents. Ever since then, I've had these issues in some form or another. Even right now, I am writing this post instead of doing the homework I should be doing.

So my question is, is it possible that this could actually be some sort of mental health condition, such as ADD or ADHD, and not just a behavioral/lifestyle issue? I'm so overwhelmed by it and feel like no matter how hard I try to fix it, I never can succeed, which has led to me wonder if maybe there's a reason for that besides me just having poor self-control.

I also want to point out that I do have recent (within the last 2 years) diagnosed, OCD. However, the problems I described far preceded the development of my OCD.

**TLDR;**

**Ever since 4th grade I have had problems such as procrastination, difficulty focusing and sustaining attention on a task, poor impulse-control (overreating, skipping class, doing things I know will cause problems for myself but am too mentally weak to stop myself from doing them), lack of motivation, lack of mental energy, extreme aversion to doing something that I know will be mentally taxing, bad memory, inability to follow a routine, getting intensely interested in something only to lose interest eventually, etc. I've also had lots of problems trying to use overreating, excessive caffeine intake, and experimenting and obsessing over various nootropic drugs to try and solve my problems and end up becoming chronically sleep deprived as a result. All this is getting worse and starting to interfere in my life. I've always thought that it was just due to behavioral/lifestyle issues, however, given that I cannot fix any of these problems long term, no matter how hard I try, I have been starting to wonder if there is something else responsible. Could this be the result of ADHD or some other medical condition? Disclaimer: I do have recently diagnosed, (within the last 2 years) OCD.**",02Oct2019,42
150,"# I have literally no idea how this works, but my friend insists someone here might have some ideas.

5 years ago I went to the doctor because I was exhausted. My mom told her I was having panic attacks (I didn't even know that's what those were), and the doctor said I have anxiety. This was diagnosed later by a psychiatrist as generalized anxiety disorder. A year later, the same doctor realized I have severe depression. Technically I was suicidal, turns out not wanting to put effort into saving your life if need be counts.

Went to university, got significantly worse. Summer after first year I started having hallucinations. The doctors were confused, because I was always aware that they weren't real. They thought it was a brain tumour.

I wanted it to be a tumour so bad.

Wasn't a tumour, so they decided it was some form of psychosis. Every anti-psychotic I tried had.... horrible side effects (anti-psychotics are sedatives, not so great for someone like me turns out).

Got kicked out of uni, ended up going to college. College psychiatrist is also a sleep doctor, bippity boppity boo turns out I have narcolepsy (something about my brain dreaming while I'm conscious causing the hallucinations), but I also have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

I am now on stimulants, they are the first medication I've been on that has ever actually helped. I have done CBT, I am on a wait list for DBT. I regularly see a counsellor, I eat relatively healthy, have a consistent sleep schedule, exercise as much as I can considering I'm in school full time and work part time, and have amazing supportive friends. I am seeing a doctor regularly and testing new medications, since no anti-depressant has worked in the past they are now seeing how I do on mood stabilizers (in the words of the doctor, ""this is to treat bi-polar disorder. I don't think you're bi-polar, but I'm out of ideas"").

But I'm getting worse. I'm losing time, hours slip by and I won't even realize. I'm sleeping 12 hours again and still need multiple naps during the day. I'm terrified of everything. Feeling any kind of emotion takes so much effort it's hardly worth it. I hate myself more than I've ever hated anything in my life. I refuse to live another 60+ years like this, I won't do it.

What else can I do?",02Oct2019,1
151,"Is it okay to take time for yourself and to stop helping others? 

A little backstory: Lately I feel like my mental health has taken a huge decline. Ive chosen to withdraw from friends and family because it’s been extremely frustrating to try to explain what’s going through my mind because I just never feel like my words can fully explain the state I’m in. A lot of my friends have pointed out my absence from social media and our usual social gatherings and are aware I haven’t been okay. Many of them will still text me to vent, seek advice, or just to talk about their issues and usually I wouldn’t ever hesitate to drop what I’m doing to listen because I know they would do the same and I do genuinely care about them (everybody wants to be heard and understood!). But I’m not too sure if something is just wrong or if I’m becoming selfish because I’m just almost at the point where I just don’t feel like I have the energy to hear them out anymore. It’s starting to tire me more and more every time they reach out because it feels like I have to pick up my broken pieces and get my shit together to be there as a whole functioning person. 

I love and care about my friends so much but I’m starting to feel like they’re draining me out completely but I feel like I would also be incredibly selfish to tell them I can’t help right now. Has anybody gone through a similar situation or maybe have advice? Would it be wrong of me to prioritize myself in a situation like this?",02Oct2019,25

It's unbelievably exhausting. Then the depression takes over. I fantasize about being able to be dead. I could never do that to my kids, at least not anytime soon. 

But today, I'm sitting in the bath tub, deep conditioning my hair. I haven't ran a comb through my hair in a week ( I have seriously curly hair so it looked extra bad😁. So it's a small step in the right direction

Last year was my first year of college and after going through a breakup, I got so depressed that I nearly failed out. I didn't go to any classes, I skipped things, and withdrew from the school with a 1.76 GPA.

I purposely don't put any effort into friendships because i have never had one that lasted more than a month or two, so at this point I don't even try, because I like to feel sad and empty.

I have such an absurd fear of rejection by people I care about.

I manage to put up quite some tough walls, insults and stuff like that don't get to me, but this shit gets me right in my core and I fall together like a house of cards. I don't feel sad, I feel hurt, cold and empty like there's a heaviness in my chest and I just want to stab myself. I can't tell if it stems from my underlying chronic depression cuz it hasn't shown its ugly face for a while, or if it's a part of anxiety, or if it has to do with past traumas, or if it could be something else entirely. And not being able to pinpoint it is driving me nuts. I don't want to have a mental breakdown over things that in the end don't even seem to affect my friends as much as they affect me, I always end up over-apologising and my entire day is fucked even if they took the apology well or didn't even mind as much. If its someone very important to me it can stick for a longer time as well.

He’s had some manic episodes aswell in which he’s become aggressive and very irritable (not necessarily towards me, though he has yelled at me a couple of times), he breaks things, hurts himself, takes drugs etc. Whenever he gets these “switches” (is what i call them) he doesn’t seem to be himself.

Over the last five years, I have battled with anxiety, depression and an eating disorder. Within the last two years, I have put in a lot of effort and have made a lot of improvements for myself. I was taken off of all medication, felt genuinely happy and content in life, was actually eating and exercising. I got into college, bought my first car and moved in with my boyfriend.

165,"I have been battling with anxiety and depression for the past 4-6 years, I always found my own way out of it, but I just had enough and seek professional help this year in January, in March I got diagnosed with social anxiety and severe depression and I was put on efexor, for my anxiety I felt that 150mg helped, then after some months it started getting worse, then everything gave me anxiety, it seems like it grew from social situations only to everyday things, I have also been overthinking a lot about everything all the time for as long as I remember, and I heard my first voice at 6 years old, and to this day I hear 4 different voices multiple times a day. I have been googling, reading on Reddit and I do think I might have OCD (I overthink everything to the extent where I am not sure what is real and what is just overthinking, I have mental rituals, I have unwanted thoughts that are terrible and makes me feel like shit), for the voices I was put on Zyprexa but I gained a lot of weight and I am now going to start on Abilify, but the voices are not the thing that is bothering me the most, what is bothering me is that I have periods of about a month where I get little to no sleep and still are tired all the time, and other periods where I sleep all the time and still tired as fuck, it really makes school and social life difficult. I take Seroquel when I have the periods where I get almost no sleep, then I get 3 hours (and 5-6 hours with the Seroquel) and the periods where I sleep all the time I can sleep for a total of 15 hours, wake up, fall asleep for some hours again after about 1-2 hours and repeat. The anxiety also makes it hard to function, the overthinking, literally just obsessing about small details and imagine a situation before it happens is also hard, it makes everything feel so...unreal(?). I also get frustrated because knowledge makes me calm, I need to know what is wrong with me to be able to calm down, and when the shrink and psychiatrist do not even know, then it does not make things any better.

166,"Hi all, I’m posting this here as well in case it backfires on r/offmychest and I added an extra paragraph.

First time poster. I’m not necessarily looking for answers because this isn’t something that can just be fixed in two seconds (I wish). 

I’ve been struggling with my depression and anxiety since high school, and now I’m in my last semester of college and things still suck. One week I’ll be feeling fine and getting things accomplished, then the next I’ll just shut down and skip class and not want to do anything. Then I have to scramble to pick up the slack so I don’t fail but the cycle repeats itself. 

I’m on medication and I have a therapist. I just don’t know why I’m still stuck in the same cycle. I don’t want to tell my family, especially my dad because he would just be like “I told you so” and get annoyed with me for not changing. 

I’m about to graduate which brings its own set of anxieties, but I’m also kind of relieved because I’ve started to hate most parts of being in school. But now I’m afraid that this is what my whole life will be like, even after I get a real job. I’m just scared that my mental illness will be a roadblock forever. 

I do have dreams/ambitions. They might not be anything big but I’ve spent my whole life living based on how others feel about me and making school/academics my identity. So I’m just now brewing free from that and I’m trying to figure out what I do like and what I want for myself.

I may not have had any “real” trauma in my life but I’ve had an unstable home life, near-constant drama between my parents and family, a lot of loneliness, being overweight since childhood, social anxiety, and a family history of mental illness. My life could definitely be worse but it’s not that great right now, either. 

Sorry if this is all over the place. I don’t want pity or “poor you” comments. I’m just tired and anxious and scared. I don’t want my life to just be one big cycle of mental illness and bad decisions. Thanks for reading. Hope you all are having a lovely week.",02Oct2019,1

I am more accustomed to fight for survival because it's the bare minimum but happiness asks for a lot more than water and air. I have no memories of myself being truly happy. Joyful, maybe. Happy ? No. So why should I fight for something that is only a mirage, another goal that I'll fail to attain?

Today was one of my worst days and I didn't know if I would make it. People have had it worse, but I'm losing hope and focus. Why should I go through all this to find happiness when I have no idea what it looks or feels like? What if I've already experienced happiness and never realised it? What if it's actually underwhelming? Why is living so important for others but not for me?
