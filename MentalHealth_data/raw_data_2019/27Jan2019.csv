0,I don’t want side effects or long term effects. Sure as hell not weight gain. My self confidence is already non existent. Enough isn’t known about these pills. I don’t have any hope left. I don’t see myself getting better. I need the meds but won’t take them. I'm pretty sure even my therapist is losing hope for me. I just want it to be over.

I almost always feel like I’m having more than one line of thoughts. at least two, with the second judging the first. and I find myself lots of times having contradicting thoughts of things. idk how to explain it (I want someone to tell me what to say to my therapist)

about symptoms:
I don’t think I have any sort of memory loss. I have anxiety and depression. and I’m starting to have trouble sleeping (idk if it’s related or not) 

is this DID? if not, does anyone know what that is called?",27Jan2019,1
4,"I was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder w/sociopathic tendencies at a young age; as an adult it's now sociopath (Antisocial Disorder) and borderline personality disorder. I mimic emotions that I think are appropriate for a particular situation, without actually feeling them. I know that this is bc I have a deeper understanding of The Bible and being born in original sin, and the importance of not holding in strict  importance the man-made laws obeyed by society. One sin is not worse than another and I do not believe that man can impose punishment according to the degree of broken laws. I just understand that nobody is better or worse than another and we're all guilty and not protected from pain or bad things happening to them. This isn't an illness. Would anyone be kind enough to weigh in on this? I'd appreciate any feedback. Thank you! ",27Jan2019,1

So ok, I am living in this new world view where people tell me, youre lucky, PTSD and be completely cured. Borderline can be completely cured, as both are mostly from some root of the childhood abuse.

Let me share some context here.
We all live in different countries around the world. And I think that USA is the country where people going to therapeutists have at least stigma. This is me judging from media, tv and stuff. I feel like stigma in USA is maybe finally less and less.

I am thinking about going to psychotherapy. This will not be good psychotherapy, in my country it is paid by the state, but lists are long, and quality is very, very poor. The waiting rooms are too crowded, and sometimes you wait for appointments for months. I am from Croatia btw. But first, let me ask you some questions for those who went to the psychotherapeutist:


1.*  How much did it help you, and did the therapist came to the root of this diagnosis of PTSD?
I will not talk about my diagnosis and I hope so niether you, because just by talking about it it gives me so much pain. I think writing this right now is a bit easy for me, because I am using some really usefull medications.
Two things about my causes: it happened what it happened. I feel shame and guilt. So, people tell me it is not my fault. It is not so easy to accept that as a fact. My abuse lasted for more than a decade. When someone say to me ""It is not your fault"", I dont believe that person. I feel like the person really must know me, really really know me for 20 years before I opened myself and when he say that, there is possibility I could believe him or her. But therapeutists will make you feel good because of money, or it is their job. What could they do to disarm this thought?


2.*   My primary thought about feeling really healed, is looking back at my past without any ounce of pain. With completely guiltless, free heart and soul I can talk about it as I talk about it what is my favorite football game or something like that. But how can you talk about it? For some time I went to Jung psychotherapeutist, realy nice guy, at the moment I mentioned the trauma, 10 years of trauma to be exact, and thinking about it makes me feel so much pain. Remembering places makes me feel pain, even tv shows and movies and commercials from that period of time makes my heart really like under the press holder or how do you call it. Every time I went from my psychotherapeutist, it made me feel pain.
Question here is how do you talk about it without feeling pain?


3.*  What schools of psychotherapy do you use? I heard cognitive behavioral therapy is the best for PTSD. But it is really the most expensive. I cannot really afford it. Therapeutists I will go to soon will be old school freudian types. But anyhow I want to hear your comments on therapeutist schools, gestalt for example or any other, and how much it helped you.


4.*  How long do you go? Months, years, decades? And how many therapists did you changed and why?


5.*  And finally. progress. Can you tell me a progress from 1 to 10 how was on beginning, and the same 1 to 10 how is it now?

&gt;I hope this post will help others too, not only me. I feel like Im going to this subreddit only when I feel pain, and I want to see and hear progress. They say it is curable, so let them make some examples. Or some of your success stories, that would be great. I am also sorry if some simmilar post has already been, and please link me to it

I wish you a road to fast recovering,
fellow sufferer.

6,"Just a warning this is a bit of a vent, so proceed with caution if you’re in a dark place. I feel like I need to tell someone the truth and I don’t know where to go so I thought I’d come here, I’m sorry if anyone gets upset by this and I hope they know that’s not my intention.

I’m 20 years old, living in London, and suffer from a depressive strand of bpd. Or at least, I think. I’ve had doctors tell me that there’s a very high chance I have bpd but it can’t be diagnosed whilst the waiting list for psychiatric assessment is closed, at least that’s what it was when I last checked. 
I don’t get too angry but when it’s bad I am very self destructive and have depressive mood swings where I don’t leave the house for the space of a week or two at a time. My job as a temp in hospitality has shifts but they’re hard to come by now that Christmas is over.
I’m chronically depressed all the time and unbearably bored and lonely. I try my hardest to make music and art but I’m so lonely and it doesn’t feel like it’s filling the void, it just feels like a distraction. As much as I love my music and the people who support me I’m still so sad and I feel so ungrateful because even though I’ve been given this gift I still feel sorry for myself.
I got addicted to Xanax after getting out of an abusive relationship and had to get myself out of it late last year and lost my best friend in the process. She won’t talk to me over a small bit of drama that happened before I went off the grid for a month. She says unless I can promise her I “won’t fuck her over again” she has no interest in speaking to me but it was so much more than me going out of my way to fuck her over or anything. I was really really sick. I was so depressed and beyond dissociative. I could barely give anyone around me compassion, even myself. 
She refuses to even have a conversation with me until I say “I’ll never fuck her over again” and maybe I’m too proud to say it but if that counts as fucking her over then I can’t make any promises. I could get addicted again, I’m very likely going to go off the grid again, and tbh it feels like if that’s how she reacts when something goes wrong with our friendship how is she going to react when things get worse. I don’t trust her to cope well, fuck knows I’m not coping well. 
I don’t think I can deal with another kind of drama right now. I’ve been through so much stuff that feels fucking impossible this year. I’m so, so tired.
So now I have no best friend, only friends who I don’t feel comfortable talking from the heart to, all I can think about is xanax, I still haven’t got any mental help after the abuse because they also have a closed waiting list for that. I’m so tired of sitting in my house with my family who all have their own mental issues and all seem to be beyond depressed too. All the people I’ve told I love you to won’t talk to me, after my recent breakup I feel lonelier than ever. 
I guess the worst part is that I feel so lonely, but the only reason I have in my mind not to kill myself is not to upset other people. I wanna be alive for myself. I wanna happy to be alive, and I don’t think I ever will be.
I’m sorry for ranting but I’m so unhappy. I don’t really expect anyone to respond or anything but I really don’t know where to go or what to do. 
Thank you to anyone that read this",27Jan2019,1
7,"I feed off of others misery. I gossip. I always need to find blame and be the victim. I can't say sorry, rather die. I also get easily hurt and act out because of those strong emotions.

8,"My (ex)girlfriend ended things about a month ago, and it sucks. Unfortunately because we’re in the same small school, I see her everyday. It’s like there’s a hole in my life right now and I don’t know what to do. Every time I see her I remember all the fun we had together and how it’s not happening anymore, I can’t even imagine saying a word to her at this point.

I went to a party last night (about 40-60 people were there)and I had some fun with friends, but she was there. Having to see her all night while we were avoiding each other was terrible. All I have been able to think about today was our relationship and how terrible not having is.

We didn’t end because of anything terrible, she said we should have talked more before we actually went out, it was too fast for her- I’m not mad at her or her reasoning, it just really sucks right now and I feel terrible. I could really use some advice or anything. I’m not suicidal, just a bit depressed, having a bad day(some days are better than others)",27Jan2019,1

10,"So recently, things have finally turned around. Or it feels like it has anyways, the past several days have been good. The main changes I made were in my diet, but outside of that I can't place what exactly changed or why I suddenly feel differently after feeling super unbalanced for so long. It's like something just clicked after trying for so long, even though I didn't change anything substantial. Has anyone else went through this? Is the uneasiness I feel even a necessarily bad thing? Or just more of a side effect of the problems I've had for what felt like half of my lifetime.",27Jan2019,1
12,"Cross-posting herr for additional support.

My husband is currently admitted to inpatient psych at a hospital in Canada since last Thursday. He is concurrently diagnosef with depression, ADHD and sleep apnea and was able to start his brand new course of ADHD meds (Vyvanse) while in hospital. The doctor had mentioned that he has frequently seen that patienta taking this medication could experience psychosis (induced by stimulants). My husband, since before entering the hospital, was adamant that he first try the medication for ADHD alone with starting antipsychotics at the same time. Despite this, he was given an antipsychotic two nights in a row which the doctor told both my husband and I was actually a medication for sleep. After coming to find out it was an antipsychotic, my husband felt like his trust in the doctors was severely damaged and asked to switch doctors. After talking to the nurses my husband felt that he was better understood and calmed down. He did not have to take the antipsychotic for the last two nights. Critically, he also understood that only this same doctor had the power to change which doctor was assigned (my husband accepted this) and my husband also said himself that he would take the antipsychotic of the need arose and he did start having symptoms.


Today I was visiting from 4-6 PM and started to notice very specific symptoms of psychosis: thinking people were referring to him when they were not, telling stories about other patients that did not make sense, closing a door to his bedroom and then knocking on it when trying to exit 10 min later, tasting spicyness in the bland hospital mac and cheese. When I pointed out some of these inconsistencies to him and asked why he was visibly distressed for a moment.


After noticing all these symtpoms, I wanted to tell the nurses station on my way out but my husband was there with me and I know those words would cause distress. My husband has a history of psychosis in both his mother and sister, and I know that is one of his biggest fears that he too would go through it.


Immediately after reaching downstairs in the hospital, I called back up to speak with his assigned nurse and tell her my concerns. She said she can't listen to my concerns (I did manage to say I was concerned about signs of psychosis) because my husband hasn't yet consented to me being privy to his medical concerns... Doh. She said she would ask him this evening if he consented, and only then would I be able to share all my observations (I have about 1 pg worth of specific symptoms).


I am awaiting another hour to pass by when I know my husband has received his evening set of meds and will be preparing for bed. Then I can call back and see if the nurse will be able to listen to me.


In the mean time, I am very concerned about the fact that the psychiatrist wont be back in until Monday and only then would he be able to change the medicine (either the ADHD one modified or the antipsychotic added). I am very worried because it seems that while 80% of people with psychosis recover in 30 days, some 5-15% continue having symptoms for the long term.


I feel like I have let my husband down so badly by not supporting the doctor's idea to keep the antipsychotic prescribed preemptively. We've only been married for 3 months and I want to have a wonderful future with this man 😢


If anyone has experience dealing with this situation or has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. Right now I don't have anyone that I trust to turn to for advice and I am feeling very alone and upset.

13,"Every time I get upset, whether it's angry, sad, numb, just any negative emotion, I get the extreme compulsion to hurt myself. When it happens my mind doesn't care what it is, a car lighter, a knife, punching a brick wall.

There have been voices in my head telling me to kill myself ever since and I'm sick of it.  I played every part of it fairly, it's an innocuous misunderstanding and I didn't hurt anyone's feelings.

16,"I’m in my very early twenties, I’ve never ever experienced anything remotely sad except for the passing of my childhood dog. I went through a pretty rocky breakup with the guy I was with since high school. We were together for five years and we broke up during a time I was also having family issues. It affected me horribly to the point that I was crying 24/7, couldn’t get out of bed or eat. Right now we’re talking but unsure of what’s going on. 

During that rough time I had no willpower to do anything for myself. I was experiencing horrible anxiety and I had no friends and have never felt lonelier. Now as I am easing back into eating and no longer crying in my bed but I also seem to have a guilty conscious or one that prevents me from being happy. There’s something in my mind that will randomly take away my strength. 

Imagine when you are super excited to do something such as go to a a hyped up restaurant and someone says like wow that sounds dumb and your excitement leaves and you no longer are interested in going. That’s how I feel about random things such as telling a friend a story, making myself food, or going to the stores.

I was all for girls I got horny for girls I haven’t even thought of a guy sexually and if I did it sickened me, until about a year ago. I started to watch gay porn and I liked it all of a sudden and now I don’t like watching straight porn I’m all for guys. I feel like something snapped inside of me. I would still love to have a relationship with a girl and marry her and have kids I love the idea of that but I’m not sexual for girls anymore and it freaks me out. And okay I’m just having a crisis and puberty is probably fucking up my body and brain but this is where it starts to get interesting. About say may 2018 I watched a male actor he’s about 21 and cool he was a good actor. Then I started to like like him. I’m almost puking thinking about this but I’m feeling like shit. So me being a idiot I looked up nudes and got them and anyway you know how that went. Then whenever I even thought of him I would get really really sad and almost cry. No matter how good of a mood I was in I would get really sad. That happened for about a month and it stopped. I still think I like guys though ughhhhh 
But about a week ago I discovered a male youtuber and the same thing happened. I started to “love” him.. oh Jesus why am I typing this.
Now I’m basically a fucking stalker and I’m obsessed with him. And of course everytime I watch his videos or think of him I get extremely sad and I cried these times. I don’t think I get really sad because I think I might be gay. I just get very sad. And I hate it but I cannot control it. I keep just looking at pictures of him and getting sad. I feel like I’m a creepy weirdo. What is wrong with me and how can I fix this I feel like I’m insane. I can’t tell my parents because they would die if I told them this.

21,"I had a rough day, I hope somebody sees this post and helps me.

I'm 20 years old and for the last year I have been running with my mom with a trainer, this trainer has multiple students and helps all of us at the same time. Over time I met most of the people he helps, I thought everybody was really nice.

Over time we started talking to a guy (around 40 years old) who never stops talking, I never thought anything about him but he was always in some sort of drama with other woman in the group of runners.

My mom always talked to him and after some time he invited us and paid us different careers (he didn't do this only with my mom and I, he usually invited around 20 other people per career). As time passed my mom has stopped running meanwhile I still run in this place, since my mom was gone he started talking to me instead (again, this dude doesn't shut up).

He would tell me tips on how to run and things like that. Usually this annoyed me cause I didn't like to hear him talk and talk but I tried to be nice and listen to him and nod my head even though i wasn't really listening.

I feel he feels as if I need his tips and that I like him talking with me (maybe because i just stay silent and nod every time he talks?), the thing is that today my mom and I decided to go on a run and he was warming up where we all usually warm up. As usual he would not stay quite about his tips and out of nowhere he says: ""Also I was talking to one of the girls and we thing you should change your bra since your chest jiggles a lot, you could get hurt"". I felt so uncomfortable since there where a couple of people around, I don't know if they heard but still.

I know the bra I use its okay since I don't hurt myself while running and my boobs don't jiggle much, they jiggle a little but not to the point to it being something to worry about. Also, if it this was the case I would feel one of the girl would tell me this, right?. After this I have felt super bad and actually got depressed.

I have a history of body dysmorphia and anxiety and this made my brain panic. I'm so sad cause my mental health (regards my body) had improved a ton this last couple of months.

Am I exaggerating and over thinking this or am I okay?",27Jan2019,1
22,"I'm not a pleasant person to be around. I've been called ""memorable"", ""the most negative person"", among other things. I make a point of keeping my mouth shut all of the time. I don't try to pick at people, but on occasion I don't keep my mouth shut and out comes negativity. It's so self-referential sometimes it's slightly ""weird"" while still being a jab. Sometimes I'll have a two-parter where the first part slips out, I catch myself, and don't finish the thought which leaving it unexplained is also weird.

I can't engage in normal banter. I've been trying for years. My mind is empty. Sometimes I think of something, then it's gone, but usually someone else is faster and goes right over me. Then there's the periods where my mind is a storm of negativity, insults, self-hatred, victimization, I can't seem to wrangle. It's weird. I'll have swings between irritability and empathy within an afternoon of being around coworkers, maybe 1/3 of the time it's actually neutral. I'm stable and content when I'm not trying to keep up with the constant socialization, it's draining and distracting. My poor memory and space-case nature is the butt of jokes at work.

I physically can't keep up with my coworkers. I'm so burnt out by the end of the workday, I lose an hour or two just kind of staring into space doing the least-effort dopamine I can get (usually just browsing the web). Then I don't have enough time to take care of myself and get enough sleep, assuming I can fall asleep at all. I might get no more than 6 hours per night every night, which is to say when I don't sleep at all I only get 6 hours the next night to recover, and I've never been able to stay asleep longer than 4 hours or so before waking.

I'm trying to juggle two jobs, get one day off per week, can only afford rent by helping my less-than-independent alcoholic parents with their own errands, and my student loans are an extra car payment.

27,"I will try to provide context in what follows. Our father was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was in his mid 20's. He was also an alcoholic, and I've garnered that this was co-morbid with his diagnosis. Our mother reflects on the negative symptoms the most, such as his inability to do his share of raising my brother and I. He left when I was a baby, my brother was around 5. I believe this had a profound impact on him.

Our relationship was fairly good early on, but as he grew up he became very hostile to me and exhibited classic anti-social behavior: deception, lying, inability to make friends outside of the 'bad clique', early drug and alcohol use... He also very early on manifested 'schizo-adjacent' traits: grandiose thinking, paranoia, propensity towards conspiracy-thinking. He often spoke in a glib and ambiguous way, like he was foiling your attempts to understand him while still trying to impress a sense of insight or savvy. Aside from his anger and hostility, which I think stemmed from his abandonment and fatherless upbringing, he always seemed to genuinely believe that he was exceptional, that he was profoundly smart and occupied a central place in the world, that it's shadowy forces and schemes revolved around him.

In his early twenties he started using meth, and this is when his grasp of reality really started to deteriorate. He'd report full-blown hallucinations, shadow people mostly. He claimed that contrails were dispersing agents that made fibers grow out of his skin, which only he possessed the ability to see. Around this time he had his first kid with his wife. They are still together, and they have a few more. She has told us that his usage is sparingly intermittent, and she is confident that she knows exactly when he is using, which I believe. Aside from this, he mostly seemed to have shaped up. He wasn't in jail, and he was holding a steady job and making quite good money doing so. He was involved in raising his children. I had my suspicions that he had schizophrenia, but I never was confident because the positive symptoms may also have resulted from meth. Cut to the past several months.

He has quit his job, he told me with nonchalance. He explained that he felt he was being pushed out and didn't want to give them the satisfaction of firing him. He has savings, and a 401k. He was going to get a job shortly, but for now he was enjoying his time at home with the kids. Okay. Around this time he confided in me that he sees 'invisible aliens made of gamma radiation' at night when he closes his eyes, and they are stabbing him, futilely.

A few months pass and I am told that he has started using again. I go to his home and his demeanor is detached, flat. He spends a lot of time in the garage, in the dark, thinking. No reports of meth-type-psychosis this time but he now no longer plans to return to his field. The wife has picked up a full time job but it is nowhere near enough to keep them afloat. She is due for a baby in a couple weeks. He says he wants to get on disability for 'sensitivity to electromagnetism', which takes a year and plenty of documentation, by the way. 

Just yesterday I visited them. She just recently had the baby. and she's returned to work. He seems to be present enough to watch the kids and the newborn, for now. I don't believe he is currently a danger to them, through negligence or worse. Still he's in the deepend. He keeps with him a backpack filed with his essential documents and, sensing some sort of imminent intervention, he claims hes got enough in it to send everyone to jail. He unplugged the router, it's been tampered with, apparently. I went there to tell him finally that I think he is schizophrenic. I said that I've suspected this since I was a teen. I implored him to go to the hospital and get help, but he immediately retorted that he doesn't need help, and he doesn't have schizophrenia. I told him his family is going to get evicted and he said matter-of-factly, 'I haven't gotten a notice'.  I told him that his wife income is simply not enough, and that the only way to avoid destitution is for him to return to work, and for that he needs to get help for his thinking. In the few times that he revealed some delusion or something, instead of humoring it or letting pass as I always have, I said, 'this is what I'm talking about'. After his simple denial I didn't push the issue. It seemed counter-productive, and so I just enjoyed time with his kids. He's a grown man, and an obstinate one at that. I can't force him to go get help. I don't know what to do. The wife is in her own state of denial too.

If I can honestly speculate, I think they are just going to move in with her parents. Those people are clueless, and do anything to avoid confronting him or involving themselves outside of genteel grandparenting. Any comments are welcome.",27Jan2019,1
28,"This is my first time posting to this sub and my first time going somewhat ""public"" with how I've been feeling. It is nice to be around others who share in the same struggles, it's somewhat comforting. Thank you to anyone who might read this.
I have been doing pretty well the last few weeks with depression/anxiety, but its rearing its ugly head the last couple days. I feel like I am always the strong one for everyone else, but no one is there for me. I am surrounded by dysfunctional and manipulative relationships, and am stuck in a really codependent relationship with a parent. This parent has a lot of health issues, so I am the caretaker. It just really weighs on you after awhile.  It's not to say that I dont love this person, but I am essentially not able to do anything for myself or anything that I want/need to do. I have this great opportunity to get a second master's degree (LMSW) but I feel like I can't pursue this dream because I have so many other responsibilities. I am just so overwhelmed and burned out. 
Any advice would be appreciated... 
Thank you all for your time, and I hope you're all doing well! ",27Jan2019,1

30,"I’m in my 20s and I’ve always struggled on and off with eating; it also depends on PMS. I feel disgusted at restaurants because I’m overloaded with stimuli of unhealthy food and lots of people eating. I’ve been conditioned to a point where I feel nausea on my way to a restaurant. I lose my appetite at the restaurant but when I’m on my own, I can eat. 

I try to still go out with my friends and family but today i just panicked and cried at the restaurant. I don’t know how to go about resolving this so I’m not associating food/eating with nausea. Do I have an eating disorder because I’m afraid of gaining weight? ",27Jan2019,1

I’ve literally worked very hard my entire life to get to where I am now with my career (I’m a teacher), a home, a lovely partner,a beautiful daughter (2), and some great friends.
Ever since I’ve became pregnant, I’ve been plagued by moments of PTSD from my childhood it seems. Remembering things that I didn’t want too, fearing that I’ll end up like my abusive, unstable, alcoholic and drug using mother (even though I know I won’t)and constantly trying to avoid my father who I never had a problem with until I got pregnant because of all that shit that came up.
I try to distance myself but I get entangled with their bullshit literally every day some way or another.
I suffered with depression in high school and then went through a bad bout of it again before I got pregnant with my daughter. I’ve always had high-functioning depression but lately I’ve just been so tired of everything. Like I’m constantly tired but sometimes I feel happy, others I’m just wanting to lie in bed and eat like shit or workout super hard just to forget.
I’ve talked to a counselled and it works but he said that my attitude was generally positive and I seemed happy when I came in so I wasn’t considered “high-need”.

33,"About a week ago, I finally told this person that I’ve been flirting with, who knows I have feelings for, that we should stop messing around and get into a relationship. But, they told me that they weren’t over their ex at all, and didn’t want to get into a relationship for a long time. And I respected that, as they still wanted to keep flirting. So I was patient, but after awhile I told them that my mental health couldn’t handle it anymore. And today, I found out that they got into a relationship. I confronted them about it, asked them why we couldn’t gotten into a relationship. And they said “Cause I wanted your mental health to get better” I blew up, telling them that my mental health could’ve considerably risen if they would’ve gotten into a relationship with me instead of lying to me about not wanting to be in a relationship for a long time.

 For most of my life I’ve had horrible mental health, I was depressed as long as I can remember until this year, was always super anxious etc. I got what I wished for and now I have no anxiety, I’m super motivated to do things, have my life together, I’m not suffering from psychosis anymore etc. But the problem is that I feel absolutely nothing and have felt no emotions at all minus annoyance in the past month and a bit now. Nada. I laugh and smile and put on a show of being a human but I feel like a lizard in a human skin. What the hell is going on? It’s not the worst I just don’t really like it. It’s like I’m on autopilot and nothing feels real. ",27Jan2019,1
35,"I really don’t see the point in posting here anymore. Most of my posts fall into the void. Course, this is the first post on THIS account. I wasn’t banned from the subreddit before. I just decided to make a new account cause I made some mistakes on the other. 

Today: So Today I went to one of those rich people parties. A Muslim family had flew their private jet and rented a local art museum for a wedding celebration. It was like so rich people they even had those little finger food. It was an actual piece of fish with just a herb on it. Anyway, there was this part where a band they’d flew in came. Everyone was dancing and having fun with the music. I just, didn’t. There was just nothing interesting about the music or anything there. It just felt sorta boring, like, well, everything. Even know things aren’t very interesting. It’s all just a consistent state of dullness. I laugh a bit and this and that but I’ve never actually danced or anything. I can even remember when I was younger just wanting to sit out when my family was having fun. And my mom would have to pull me in or something. 

Friends: I don’t actually have any good friends. I moved to a new town and met some guys I sit at lunch with. We laugh a bit but they don’t care that much. It’s like. We have open campus and everyone’s going out the get food and shit. I can’t drive (I’m in high school but SD driving laws are different), and they just leave without me. I’d like to think they simply forgot about me. But they’d seen me, knew where I was, and most certainly knew I carry around cash. So I don’t think that’s the case. I barley even know anything about them except their names. One girl went on a little speech about her life issues and shit but that’s bout it. I just can’t really talk to people that much anymore. I know what I want to say, I just can’t or it always comes out the wrong way. I always pronounce it wrong or something and sorta justs wants to make me stay silent. I even just don’t care when people gets hurt sometimes. My brother had thought I’d stolen his Playstation controller and attacked me. I hit him in the throat, and he couldn’t go to school cause of the swelling. I knew I should have felt bad. But I just didn’t. 

Anger Issues?: I sometimes get mad at things that other people find weird. My best example was when before I moved and was with one of my school friends, Tyler. I was reading this book I’d just got and he messed up the front cover. One of those annoying bends that you can’t get out. I’d got mad and started yelling for my mom to drop him back at home. It was a small thing, but I’d gotten really mad over it. I finished organizing my room once. Which was new since a lot of people call me unorganized (I don’t agree). But, then my dad came in to clean and put things out of place. I got extremely mad and said he might as well keep the room if he was going to mess things up (he just moved stuff around). I can understand it was ridiculous looking back (that’s the beauty of retrospect). But it seemed completely reasonable at the time. 

Weird thoughts: Sometimes, when something is going on, I just think about what thing I could do that person. Like a kid was playing with a big pack of water bottles out in the snow. And I kept thinking about grabbing one and pouring one on him or throwing it at him or something. I remember a while ago when a girl was being annoying. And I just pulled a pin out a poster on the wall thinking about what I could. I stopped and put it back and didn’t do anything. But, it’s just weird thinking about it now. 

Situation: I live up in the Mountains in South Dakota. Since my mom had to move for her new job. It’s good. She’s got a lot of stock in a company that could blow up. But definitely not right now. We’re living out an apartment on lease for a year. She claims we’ll go back home after the lease is up. But I don’t think we’re going to. I don’t have much freedom. I’m just at home, school, fencing, or some store. I can’t just ask to go outside. Not only because they won’t let me but also because of the perpetual hell-like amount of snow and cold wind. I could get my drivers license. But any spots aren’t open till the summer. So, If I needed help or anything I’d have to go to them. 

Help?: People have recommended that I see a professional or something. But, I don’t know if I really need to. Even if I do, I just don’t know how. I’ve wanted to tell them. But there’s nothing worth they suspecting I need serious help. And if my mom thinks I’m hiding something from her and don’t trust her to talk to her about it. It may just really hurt her feelings. I just want to know if there are other options or how to tell them. ",27Jan2019,1

I’ll have moments(sometimes days) where everything will go numb

-I’ll be able to feel things but it doesn’t feel real or it doesn’t feel like I’m feeling it
-I’ll see the world around me but if feels like I’m looking through someone else’s eyes
-I’ll hear people talking but not make the connection that they are
-I’ll be doing something then completely forget everything that was happening
-I’ll be in class and then not be able to remember anything

So basically everything stops feeling real
All senses
I stop feeling a connection to myself

44,"It all started over the past couple years and I've been getting increasingly worried about my mental health and emotional stability. About a year ago I started my first year at college and I failed to make any meaningful friends which spiraled me down into a depression where I would sleep until 4pm, not go outside, and smoke a lot of cigarettes. I didn't tell anyone this, but I was eventually able to get out of it for a while until around September of 2018 and I stopped smoking weed almost completely. I started feeling super depressed again despite finding friends and I would get intrusive thoughts like my parents dying or missing highschool. My memory is pretty terrible and it takes a lot of effort to remember what I ate the day before but I'm worried because recently I've been second guessing myself and overthinking things more than before on if I did certain simple tasks (did I forget to push the elevator button, did I push the crosswalk button already? , etc.) . My memory seems terrible despite quitting weed mostly and tapering off of cigarettes and I've been feeling demotivated to do anything.  Sometimes I get random spurts of passion where I'd feel great and do stuff, but most of the time I feel really sad about everything until something good happens. If something pisses me off during the day sometimes I can't help but think about excessively for the night or even the days to follow (it used to be manageable but its getting worse). I was looking around online and I'm thinking it might be OCD but I'm not 100% sure. I'm scared to go to the doctor because I'm at college all alone in a different state than my hometown and I don't want to go to a therapist because I'm really bad at expressing my emotions. What should I do?",27Jan2019,1
45,"Sorry for the longish post - this ended up going on longer than I intended.

I am going to a psychiatrist for the first time Monday afternoon and I really don't know what to expect. I've had issues with anxiety for several years now but I've been feeling lately like I might have depression but I've never had an official diagnosis. 

I'm a second semester nursing student and now this is becoming a problem and getting in the way of school. This is mostly because I get very overwhelmed with all the work and studying that I need to do that a lot of the times I just don't end up doing it (which was not really a problem for me until I started nursing school). I have a hard time being motivated to even go to class sometimes because I have a hard time concentrating and I live an hour away from my school. I am tired pretty much all the time, even if I laid around in bed for most of the day and did basically nothing. It's been getting a lot harder for me to get up in the morning and get started. I feel like I've been moving slower and slower lately and by the time I've mustered up whatever I need to study or anything, the day is mostly over. I worry sometimes that I might just be a lazy piece of shit but I've never felt like this before. I feel like I'm on the verge of failing even though I am doing relatively well and I want to quit school all the time.

There's also just been a lot of stuff going on in my family life, mostly in the last two years. I'll try to keep this part short mostly because there's too much for me to talk about but all in all, my dad left my family about two years ago very suddenly for another woman and I have not seen him since. My parents got divorced about a year ago and it's been very hard on my mom and she has, in turn, taken it out on me and my sister with screaming, projecting, etc. Most recently, she was talking with me about how the end of my parents' marriage came about and said to me ""I'm not trying to make you feel guilty"" and then proceeded to tell me that me losing my virginity to a man I wasn't married to played a part in their divorce. I don't know how she came to this in her mind but it definitely made me feel like shit to know that she really thinks I'm partly to blame for their shitty marriage. She's also told us all before that if she knew what was going to happen that she never would've married him, never would've had kids, told us to not have children, etc.

I'm mostly worried because of how much this may cost and I will probably end up not being able to keep going if I can't afford it even if I need it. I'm also worried because I took advantage of the free student counseling services at my last university and my mom dragged me to the counseling service at my church and both experiences totally turned me off to therapy; I'm trying to go in with an open mind.",27Jan2019,1
46,"It all started when I was pretty young as a child. At funerals I wouldn't cry and I always felt like sometimes I wasn't feeling the way a normal person should feel. Other than a few depressive episodes that I never told anyone about in middle school, my years leading up to college were pretty average. One thing that I started doing towards the later years highschool was excessively smoking weed and nicotine. It wasn't a problem at first and it was pretty fun but I started to taper off of it after a while during my first year at college. I failed to make any meaningful friends and it made me extremely depressed. I would wake up at 4pm on some days, go to class then go back to my room and sleep again. The only thing I did was do school work, and hook up with girls on tinder. Eventually I was able to get out of my depression around spring time but I noticed my memory was getting extremely bad (remembering what I ate the day before was really hard). It started improving after a while and my memory was getting better but around September of 2018 I started falling in the same depressive cycle except it seemed worse. I would wake up late, lay in bed all day, walk around for a little then stay on my computer until I fell asleep. All of this would be manageable to deal with considering i've had it before but I noticed my emotions are more volatile. I go from super happy to super angry to super sad way more than before and i've been having to deal with a lot more intrusive thoughts that I can't shake. An example is earlier today when I started crying because I thought about my parents' inevitably dying and the simplicity of highschool life ending. Often times my excessive thoughts are something that annoyed me during the day that I can't forget about until the night or even days later. I'm also extremely obsessive with relationships which tends to scare girls away which often goes like this (meet them, obsessively text them, they ignore me for a little, I get angry and stop talking to them, feel stupid and sad about it and try texting them again). I don't want to be like this but I'm worried my emotions are becoming more controlling over my life. I was researching this online and I think it might be OCD but I'm not completely sure.

51,"This is a short novel about (maybe?) Schizoid Personality Disorder, and it includes my story up until this point, so if you're not interested in that don't waste your time. I need to vent, and I'm surprised that I even had the energy to write this, so I'm taking advantage of it in the moment, even though I don't really know what this is. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, here's the story; my whole life people have called me a psycho. I never cared, so I never even really thought about why people would call me names. But now at 21 it's starting to make more sense. 

These symptoms started when I was around 14. I guess I just thought that my personality change was a part of ""my body changing"" or whatever. I only remember having one close friend in my life, and we haven't really talked since I was like 18. I just prefer to be alone, and I literally don't experience loneliness. I simply don't care about the things people talk about, or the way people spend their time. When anybody, including my own mother is within 20 feet of me it's like my head fogs up and I can't think. The closer the relationship the more my head fogs up. I always just thought it was anxiety and depression, which I never sought treatment for because it's too expensive. But, for some strange reason, in 2018, what I called anxiety and depression just went away. My overall mood improved towards the beginning of the year, and just a month or so ago I've learned to control my anxiety. I always thought that when I reached my early 20s, I would change and be normal. Once I started drinking, maybe I would socialize better. 

The problem is that my behavior really hasn't changed at all. I'm still the same person, except I'm basically empty inside. The only thing I really feel is pride, shame and anxiety. How fun is that? You'd be surprised at how far pride and anxiety can get you in life before you realize how empty you are. I'm not interested in socializing at all. I'll just spend an hour a day on anonymous social media like Reddit and Discord and I'm content. I don't even care about spending time with my family. I care about people, but it's not really a gut feeling, it's just in my head and nowhere else. I'm constantly motivated by what I SHOULD do, not by what I WANT to do. I understand that family is important, and that friends can be useful, but the emotion just isn't there. If someone asked for my help with something, I would gladly help. But I don't see what reason I have to just attend the movies with them, or do whatever social butterflies do these days like make prank videos and go to fury conventions and shit. If I want to feel an emotion, I have to really focus on it. Nothing feels real, and increasingly so in recent years. It takes a lot of meditation, caffeine and self harm to feel present. 

I started worrying about my lack of empathy. I don't think I want to hurt anyone, but what if I take the wrong drug or dissociate? Last week I made a post asking if it's possible that I could be a sociopath and not realize it. A couple different people mentioned that it sounded more like Schizoid Personality Disorder than ASPD. So, I did a bunch of google searches, read some Wikipedia pages, and watched a few YouTube videos. To be clear, I've tried out Myers Briggs, astrology and all types of personality tests, and while they're fun, I never felt like they were accurate... (I mean, a Libra? Me? Yeah right...) But when it comes to mental illness, I usually never identify with what I'm reading. However, with Schizoid, I check every box. Like, every single one, except perhaps being indifferent to criticism/compliments. I'm usually indifferent, but not all the time, and it depends on who's talking. Like I said, I'm motivated by pride, which gets me to work in the morning. 

Earlier today while driving I parked on the side of the road and tried to cry. I couldn't do it. I haven't cried in years, and when I did cry it was because my pride was hurt. Anyways, when I tried to cry it was like trying to sneeze. I felt like I almost could, but it just wasn't happening. It was as if I was pretending to cry. Then, I tried to look at a few objects around me and tried to convince myself of how real they were. I had some music on, and I just told myself again and again, ""this is real, and this is real, and this is real..."" and then I just felt tired and fell asleep. Life just feels like a dream, and everything is inconsequential. 

&amp;#x200B;

So anyways this whole SPD thing has been on my mind, and while I don't really care that I have it, or that I have the symptoms, just the fact that I COULD have it has given me a great amount of comfort and confidence. ""I'm not violent, I'm just a loser"" I told myself when I discovered the condition. I slept really well last weekend. ""I don't need to be afraid of myself."" But, it's still just a question. I don't actually know if I have this. I can't just diagnose myself. And this is my problem. I filled out a questionnaire to send to a psychiatry office, and I can't decide if I should even send it in. What do I tell them during the appointment? ""I don't care about anyone or anything and I prefer to be alone."" I can just imagine the doctor saying ""Ok, and so what's the problem? Just avoid people and don't do anything."" 

Like, I don't really have a problem. My problem is that I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, and I want to know. The only symptom I really want treatment for is having a lack of interest in few, if any activities. I really hate that I have no interests, because if I did, maybe I could have a job that I enjoy. And I don't know, feeling something would be nice. Imagine enjoying music again, or falling in love with someone? Maybe being normal would be like taking ecstasy or something. But, it's not like I'm in pain, or I'm stabbing people in the street in a Santa hat. So what's the problem? Why am I visiting a doctor? Why don't I just fuck off and let people with real problems get help? I guess the reason I want a diagnosis is that if I can sleep better at night with the JUST THE POSSIBILITY that I have this disorder, imagine how well I could sleep if I actually knew I had it? I would have the justification to just be alone without feeling like I'm a psychopath, and if I DID want a relationship it would be a step in the RIGHT direction, not in the WRONG direction (does that make sense? Right now I sincerely believe I would be hurting anyone I tried to be close with, because I don't know what's wrong with me or what I'm capable of. But if I knew, then I would have something to work against and I wouldn't be scared of becoming violent or something.) 

Is that reason enough to pursue a diagnosis? I really feel like if I walk in there and explicitly tell them I think I have the disorder, they'll be more likely to tell me I don't have it and that I'm pretending in an attempt to score drugs, or that I've convinced myself I have it when I don't. Like, I'm pretty sure they aren't just going to put me in a cat scan and tell me with 100% confidence that I have a disorder, they'll just meet me and ask questions. I just want to tell them my symptoms, and I want THEM to suggest it. I want THEM to bring it up, because I want to know without a shred of uncertainty that I have Schizoid, or that I don't. The power of suggestion is real. But maybe they won't? Maybe they won't think to? Maybe I'll end up with one of those bullshit doctors who avoid diagnosing patients to ""avoid labels, because labels make people feel insecure and different, which is counterproductive in therapy, because my job is to tell people what they want to hear, and in a progressive society there are no personality disorders there are only personality types, and we're all a just a little bit different, but keep going to therapy because we're all damaged, my career needs to stay relevant, give me money."" The questionnaire I filled out only asked questions about anxiety, mood disorders and ADHD; nothing about personality disorders. And I have a horrible past with doctors denying that I have a problem, and then just telling me to leave. I tore my meniscus when I was 18, and I still can't run more than 4 or 5 miles before the pain is unbearable, but even back when I recently tore it and I could barely walk, my physician's response was just ""well you can walk, can't you?"" And he didn't offer any kind of help. I'm worried that this will be the same experience. Should I try to find some kind of expert on personality disorders, even if they live on the other side of the country and start talking to them? I can't just go on in life not knowing. I need to know. My need to know is being sourced by my anxiety, which like I said, I can control now, but my anxiety might be smarter than I am. Like for example, it might be the only thing keeping my violent thoughts in check. Controlling my anxiety is helping me walk into Starbucks without shaking hands and a trembling voice. But when I think about strangling someone and I feel fear, I start to think that maybe my anxiety knows a thing or two. 

I'm not interested in therapy; I don't feel a need for it, because a therapist can't prescribe medicine or give me a diagnosis. They'll just tell me what they think I want to hear and tell me I need them. I took one session of therapy because of an anxiety attack, but that's no longer a problem. It's too expensive anyways, and I've always felt like half of a therapists job is to convince people that they need to stay in therapy. Everybody thinks they need therapy these days. I just want to know with certainty if I have this disorder or not, but am I going to achieve that with just a 30 minute appointment with a psychiatrist? Is he just going to prescribe me therapy without a diagnosis? (My health insurance doesn't include mental health, this is all coming straight out of my checking account). Does it take time to do a diagnosis like this? Even if I am diagnosed, I'm not even that motivated to be treated, and there doesn't seem to be a real treatment anyways. I'm just really tired of the confusion about why I'm such a freak. I want to be diagnosed, not because I hope to change, but because I want to know that it's not something worse. I want to know that I'm not going to have a psychotic break and kill someone, or dissociate while I'm driving, or wake up one morning thinking I'm someone else. As empty as I am, I feel that my life is just chaos, and the only thing I have to take comfort in is the pride I take in having the discipline to keep showing up to work despite how much I don't give a rats ass about it. Nothing is enjoyable, everything I do takes conscious effort. Playing video games, socializing, and waking up at 4:30 to run all involve the same amount of pain (which is a little but not much) and require the same amount of self control. EVERYTHING is work. Sure I could lie in bed for the rest of my life and make Reddit posts like these, but my pride is telling me to find out what my problem is so I don't find myself in jail someday for murdering someone in cold blood because it turns out that xanax was the one thing my dark side needed to finally break through and finally do something about my annoying roommate.

52,"Last week i went running with pain in my legs, but i decided not to care about it and convinced myself that it doesn't hurt.I wasn't even feeling the pain while running and doing leg [exercises.](https://exercises.In) But after coming home i could feel my legs as usual , like not fully feeling them like they're disconnected or something , i could move them and everything but it was [weird.In](https://weird.In) the shower when i crouched down i could feel them again normally and felt the exhaustation coming up.The next morning they were hurting very much , My jaw was shaking , had a bad mood , food wasn't tasting good, and just felt bad overall but that could be just from the overtraining or something.Now my legs feel light when i walk. It's different but maybe it's just in my head.  


Is this possible?   
I'm worried i caused something bad this jaw shaking in the morning and all doesn't feel good.

53,"I kept all of the ugly things inside and outside of me ever since I was a kid. If I was unable to completely hide that something is wrong I'd at least disguise them as some more acceptable type of problem. I felt like the whole world was watching my every step while inside I was drowning and trying to scream. It was very hard to cope as a teenager, but I've used every ounce of emotional and intellectual capability to reinforce and improve that mask as I grew older. Things are still bad, but I feel like the worst part is behind me. So many times I've thought I can't go on anymore, so many times there was no way I can handle things anymore, but I felt that I had no choice, so I swallowed the pain and tore down another wall. Surviving breakdowns became part of my work cycle.

What am I without this mask? There's only the damaged me. My personality is split in many parts, bent and perverted to work with an extremely negative and self-destructive mindset, unable to handle normal human relationships. My emotions are immature, inconsistent and contradictory. The only consistency is that every part of me wants to die. People like to throw platitudes about someone being strong or brave, but life is not a romantic novel or movie, effectively I'm worthless. I'm aware that prejudice often exists only due to ignorance, but ignorance is how the world works. Shallow appearance of things determines what people think, what they believe, who they love, who they hate, and how the world works, not some deeper truths that people only think about when they're high or attending ethics classes. Who I am is insignificant, who I seem to be is the only thing that matters.",27Jan2019,1

55,"I mean, it's not like the good folks here on Reddit can offer a valid diagnosis. But I'd like to know whether it'd be a good idea to consider seeking professional help for what I'm experiencing.

I'm a 20-yr-old female college student who struggles immensely with self-restraint. That's the real biggy. I'll attempt to commit to a task, but whenever I even slightly lose interest/motivation, it's like my brain just checks out. I can't focus for the life of me, and even the most mundane distractions will rip me away from any semblance of productivity. And forget about finishing projects, especially the long-term ones. I'm an artist, and often I'll find that over the course of two-three hours, instead of committing to a single drawing, I'll end up bouncing between 5 different ones, making a tiny amount of progress on each of them. I've gone months without actually finishing a single drawing. It's an incredibly inefficient work style, but the only one I can consistently manage.

I'm pretty fidgety, and when I'm sitting down for an extended period of time, I'll get up and use the bathroom way more often than necessary just so I can walk around. I can't seem to stay seated for long, in general (unless I'm being sufficiently stimulated). I'll fidget, or \[again\], make excessive visits to the bathroom. I also pace like a madman when on the phone, if that means anything.

I'm pretty impulsive, with both my money and my time. If I decide I want (or want to do) something, I'll almost always just let myself have it. Not because the consequences of doing so are benign, but because their effects aren't imminent enough. I could give these decisions (like buying an unnecessary $200 iPod touch) more thought and deliberation, but there's often an urgency to these impulses (I have to buy this thing NOW! Quick, before I stop being excited about it!) that prevents me from doing so.

Sometimes I forget to pay attention during normal conversations. I am RECKLESSLY forgetful. I feel like a total screw-up of a human, and have for a damn while. Even if I don't have ADHD, if there's anyone who can relate to what I'm going through, and has advice to offer, I could use it.

Person A has few close friends, is isolated from her family, lives alone, and was subjected to some bullying in the high school. She says she has “tried everything” from therapists to antidepressants with little success (she went to a doctor as recently as last week), and that the cost of treatment and counseling is becoming too much for her. Most of her time is directed towards rigorous classwork or playing video games, and her social media is filled with posts that mention depression, anxiety, and death. She tells me she feels exhausted, miserable and hasn’t had a good day in years.

At the request of my friend, I agreed to make myself available to Person A whenever she needed to talk online, and check in on her once in a while (I'm trying not to act like a therapist, but more like a friend who is always ready to listen).

&amp;#x200B;

She mostly, but not only, hears those voices before falling asleep. She describes them as a sound ""I'm not even sure we can produce as humans"". Or those voices say the same word (or short sentence) over and over again. Those voices are not telling her to do something dangerous. They also don't try to upset her. What she hears doesn't make any sense apparently. She says that life is ""life is tolerable this way"", but obviously she still want to get rid of those voices and sounds. On top of that she also hears ""metal creaking, pounding against the walls, screaming"" and stuff like that. It is probably unrelated but she also has a tinnitus for her whole life.

69,"I think it depends on the nature and severity of the mental illness. Some mental illnesses cause the individual to make connections that others don’t. I believe autism is one where the individual is making too many connections in their mind which paralyzes their physical movements.

I think bipolar individuals on average make more connections between things than most people. This gets out of hand when you are manic. You start believing that these thoughts are the more important thoughts in the world. (God wants me to do this, aliens are coming, seeing things...).

I honestly think that with the right medication and right counseling, people will mental health issues are blessed with hyper awareness of reality. It is not some sort of “super power”. It is just something that we have. We are hyper aware of reality and it makes us go “crazy” as some regular folks would say.

Mental health is not a joke. We are not crazy. We are not blessed (even tho we could potentially use it for good). We are only burdened with the weight of reality that so many normal people forget.

If you just forget for a moment that you are the center of your world and meditate on the fact that we all are extras in someone else’s world, I think that by taking attention off yourself, you will feel less pressure and less anxiety and less depression. I say less... it will never be completely gone. Many of is are stuck with a life long struggle. And you have the choice and ability to live a balanced life which is at war with your mind.

With the help of medication, counseling, group therapy, music, art, dancing, relationships, God, religion, politics, friends, nature... I believe that you can do this. You CAN live a good life. You WILL get better with time.

71,"Hey everyone. Would love to share this post from my blog, it's my most personal story to date and all feedback is welcome!

**Champion Of Worry**

It felt like my stomach was a heavy pile of bricks. Overthinking everything again as if I’m the worrying champion #1, but not proud of winning this time. The pent-up emotions were so hard to suppress and at the moment I decided to let the control go I burst into tears.

‘’Fuck, I’m a mess…’’, I thought to myself. I picked myself up and got ready. The therapy session was perfect timing.

I wasn’t eager on visiting a psychologist, I thought it was only necessary for really serious cases. I wasn’t totally sick, sad and depressed. But there was something going on for years that finally had to be addressed.

Instead of solving the problem myself like I’ve been trying to for so long, it was time to give up my pride. I’ve always felt like the last thing I needed was a scientist asshole with glasses telling me to ‘Open up and talk, son.’ But I was wrong.

I changed my mind about this when talking to a good friend about the different challenges we were facing with girlfriends, work, school and life in general. He told me he sometimes visits a therapist. After the conversation I looked his therapist up. He looked quite good and experienced. I booked an appointment and it felt empowering. ‘Fuck, yeah! Life on point.’, I thought for a minute. Of course this was just the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

**The moment of Truth**

Fast forward to the day of my first session. I rang the bell and entered his art-deco office, where I felt a great sense of nostalgia, even though I’d never been there. André was older than I had expected, approaching 75 years. Still full of energy and passion for his profession, he looked like a wise and competent man.

After some easy intro conversations, we approached the topic of my anxiety during my third session. The reason of my visit and a subject of my life for quite some years already. He asked me: ‘Where do you feel it mostly and what does it feel like?’, to which I answered that it’s just an adrenaline-ridden experience feeling your knot-up stomach.

&gt;*it’s like running away from a huge pride of lions chasing you down, all wanting a piece of you. ALL THE TIME*

Always looking over your shoulder for potential danger: on the streets, with the people you meet and so on. This feeling was everywhere, all the time. He asked me a few more questions and used some techniques. At that moment, breathing became shallow again and through a special tapping technique, André was able to expose a deep childhood memory. And it was incredibly emotionally charged.

I saw myself again as 6 year-old boy. I lay in bed and I heard lots of yelling from downstairs. It was not singing or anything but it was a hard, hateful and aggressive argument. I curled into a fetal position in bed and I remember feeling very alone. With danger close by and no security blanket around.

 

**Catch and Release**

Andre gave me space and silence to accept this memory and suddenly it dawned on me. I had this insight: ‘It’s not my fault, it’s not my fault…’. At that point, I felt a great sense of release that was almost cathartic and I started bawling my eyes out for a good 5 minutes. Just like the scene in Good Will Hunting, where Matt Damon realizes he’s not the cause of his childhood problems. 

[Good Will Hunting Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtkST5-ZFHw)

&amp;#x200B;

For so long I thought that it was all my fault, that I caused the problems at home. I felt like I was responsible. On top of that, the feeling of constant danger had been instilled in me, giving me a sense of overall anxiety. This unconscious belief had caused my problems overtime. Because of this session, I now had a different perspective on the situation. There was a name and a place to give that memory, which lead to the opportunity to start accepting it more.

If you are struggling with something more serious, don’t hesitate to visit and talk to a professional, because:

* **We don’t always know where to look**

As we’re going through life as an individual, we see everything from our own perspective or through life’s glasses. While this is a great thing, it is also quite limiting at times when it comes to big life’s realisations or decisions. Blind spots or personal bias can severely limit our progress. Our minds have been formed and structured in a way that is very hard to change.

That’s why some people keep choosing the wrong type of partner. Or that some people just can’t put the bottle of wine down. Our behaviors and beliefs are ingrained in our being and sometimes it takes external input to realize that and start taking action.

It’s also why I never really saw my situation from another perspective until I had the sessions.

* **A talk with friends or family is not the same**

Whatever you say, it’s not the same… Of course, conversations with good friends and family are awesome and definitely help you vent some issues you have inside, but it’s not the same. A lot of people around you will give you answers and advice you want to hear.

As written in [this article:](https://psychcentral.com/lib/therapists-spill-how-therapy-is-different-from-talking-to-a-friend/)) ‘they have something at stake in your life and their views, needs, and opinions are going to color their interaction whether they are aware of it or not.’

Whether it is huge mental issues or trying to get some clarity in your life’s situation, it is a great way of getting someone else’s ‘objective’ perspective.

* **There is nothing abnormal or shameful about it**

Getting help is not abnormal at all. As soon as I started to open up about this subject with my close friends and family, I had the surprising response of people telling me they did or still do the same thing. More people are involved in therapy in one way or another, and even more people actually would benefit greatly from it. Open up, own it and this will be a great addition in your life.

This [interesting world map (2016)](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health) shows that around 20-25% of people in European countries and in USA have some form of mental health disorder. So don’t ever think you are the only one. I’d like to invite you to giving up the silence surrounding these subjects. ",27Jan2019,1
72,"A few main problems, maybe more that I don't know about: 

Depression, extreme anxiety, worried everyone hates me.

________

What I really need help with is the first three things. I don't know if I can afford to see a therapist but my uni does have people to talk to.

I feel like I may need CBT.

I'm part of a sports club and I would like to take a break (maybe 4-8 weeks or more) to sort myself out but I feel like this may make things worse. I do plan on joining some meetups in the meantime.

One of my issues is that I always feel like I'm on the outside of any social group, and that everyone talks to everyone on Snapchat and Facebook except to me. I'm wondering if I should actively change this or grow to not care, I really have no strategy right now.

Another element of this is jealousy, when I see friends messaging people constantly but I rarely get a message it makes me feel unloved.

If I do take a break, what should I say to the people in the club that I'm closest to? More, less, or nothing?

I'm really in a terrible spot, right now. None of my problems are that serious at the moment but they're very severe and could get worse.

Is it also worth getting bloodwork done?

It was like I wasn't really there, even though I was.  I put my head down a few times on the desk. When the exam ended amd it was time to put our pens down, I suddenly snapped back into reality, but I had absolutely no recollection of what I had written down.

Could this have been due to stress or fatigue? I wasn't on any kind of meds or supplements at the time. I never spoke to anyone about this and I really want to know what it was, it it normal, was it a warning sign, etc.

So it comes that she sees films up to approximately 30 times in very short periods of time. I don't know why she's doing this and she doesn't tell me either. She could draw or dance (both were hobbies of her) or go out with our dog or  just watch new films, but if she is bored she never would choose those things to do. At first I found it funny, but the longer she does this, the more am I concerned. Is this something to worry about? ",27Jan2019,1
77,"im bipolar i might even have borderline personality disorder they think. I just dont know how to live, im on 5 diffrent meds and they are constently getting changed, my girlfriend and best friend of 6 years left me because i am a verbally abusive terrible person when the rage kicks in. i just dont want to live anymore, whats the point of living if all it is is suffering and insanity? i want to die, but if i die then i will never get a chance to get the love of my life back, but i just dont know how to do this. i dont know how to live. i dont want to live, the only reason i have left too live is too try and get her back but theres no guarantee and i find it hard to keep going. i would kill myself in a instant if i knew it would be painless and quick, but yet again, no guarantee. i just want to die. i want it all to stop. i just want it all to stop.

79,"So, that's a lameass title, but really I have no idea what else to say. I've struggled with my mental health for years, since early adolescence, but I've never been diagnosed with anything specific, only symptoms of many things.

I'm finally on a wait list for a psychiatrist, but I'm trying to figure out what I might have before the end of the year, when my appointment will probably be, in hopes that I can start helping myself.

Here's what I experience;

- Mood swings, like one minute I'll be perfectly fine and the next ill be super angry, or one minute I'll be extremely happy and the next ill be balling. 
- Highs and Lows. My SO has noticed that some months I'll be really happy and enthusiastic about everything and super positive and the next few months is like a downward spiral of depression and anger, but I can't spot myself in these phases until they've passed.
- Anxiety, mainly about germs and people and public crowds (which probably stems from my emetophobia). 
- I have been known to spend lots of money recklessly on things that we don't need in the heat of a moment, only to regret it later.
- I need constant reassurance from my SO that they love me, or I'll start to think that they don't. I honestly don't know why this is because we're very happily married.
- I sleep. A LOT. I can sleep from 8pm to 10am and sometimes inbetween.
- This was much milder as a child, but seems to be getting worse as I get older.

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions please reach out! 😊",27Jan2019,1
80,"All my time is spent thinking of argument scenarios in all kinds of situations with all kinds of people. It's extremely draining, and I always lose in the end, which then leaves me feeling drained and upset as if I've had an actual argument with someone, except there's no possibility of talking it out (because it never really happened in the first place). It leaves me feeling utterly powerless.

The stupid thing is instead of telling myself ""well, it didn't really happen, it's just something I imagined"", I can't help but think that it's something that could realistically happen at any moment. Because of this it still has a very real effect on me, because it tells me that were I ever to actually end up in such a situation, I would lose and the effect will be a million times worse because this time it would be real.

And I can't stop doing it, every time I lose an argument in my head, the need to keep imagining it in order to actually be prepared rises. So I do it more often, lose more often, my need to keep trying in order to protect myself (in case it actually happen irl) increases, and so I end up in a horrible downward spiral.

So many therapies or meditation/mindfulness exercises focus on realizing the objective situation, and for some reason this seems to be my weakest point. Because for as far as I know I rarely get involved in heavy arguments, irl there's not much going on to talk about. It's literally all just scenarios in my head that haven't happened yet, but they have an almost equally negative effect on me.

I was wondering if anyone perhaps has any advice on how to go about this, because I really can't seem to stop these compulsive thought arguments. Imagine getting into about 10 intense fights on the daily. I'm absolutely exhausted and feel really hopeless because of this. On top of that I feel extremely guilty and hesitant to talk about this, because my actual life really isn't so bad when others have so many struggles to deal with irl that they can't control. My problem is literally just in my head, defeating myself for God knows what reason.

I'm already going to therapy, but it's going a bit rusty so far. I'd be really grateful just to hear other people's thoughts or opinions on this.

Tl;dr
My real life seems fine, but I'm constantly tortured with imaginary compulsive arguments in my head that I lose 9/10 times. I can't seem to stop it, because I feel like it's a way of preparing for the worst (even though it seems to not be working).

I feel like it helps me as it takes away my constant paranoia temporarily and it allows me to feel emotions while taking away my depression. While it doesnt help me in all the things i deal with, for the day I do smoke I just feel half better. To me that's better then none.

I always think the worst in situations and have weighed the doctor decision for years straight and I hoped cops would have just got me by now because I cant make a decision for anything. But I have finally decided to go.  What worries me is a doctor will write off my issues I have had all on the fact of smoking marijuana(which it's been a week and a day because I am getting myself off it to get help on my other stuff)

I want help... I need help.. paranoia/fear of everyone, depression, Anxiety, cant talk to people or make eye contact,  OCD issues, and other things I struggle to bring up anonymously. I'm sick of having my mind just in a constant struggle and if I go and the doctor finds thc in my system all he will do is write it off as that. I just want to feel how normal life is.

92,"Hi guys. I've been roaming the forums for some time now, as a guest, and I have decided to sign up to share this.

\*\*\*Disclaimer: This is not a medical advice, I am only sharing my story. Mephedrone is an ilegal substance, and everyone has their own psychology and biochemical makeup, so what worked for  me might not work for others. \*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been living with mental illness for around 7 years now.

I have had a range of symptoms starting with anxiety, all the way to depression, bouts of depersonalization and psychotic breaks. On top of that I started to develop physical symptoms, something alike asthenia or chronic fatighe syndrome. To sum it up, I was feeling like shit all day long, mentally and physically. I have tried probably more than 100 psychiatric medications, including all kinds of antidepressants, anxyolitics, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, etc. I also tried a whole range of vitamins, herbs, etc, to no avail. I reached a point where I was full on suicidal. I literally had a plan on how to end my life.

Also, recreational drugs where of no use. Before my illness I would smoke joints and feel real good, now I smoke weed and go crazy. I started doing heroin and cocaine, which provided me a short escapade, but actually increased my psychotic symptoms in the long run, and I was hospitalized when I overdid metamphetamines. Also things like MDMA had no effect on me. 

I lost all my friends since I got ill, I was unable to fall in love or mantain a relationship, and I got to a point where I couldn't even recognize my family, or myself for that matter. It was my definition of hell.

So, I had already found my way to commit suicide, when someone I met online and then irl, gifted me two mephedrone pills.

I took half a 220mg pill, and about 40 minutes later I begun to feel better. After two hours I found that I had a lot of energy, I actually wanted to engage with people, everything around me was interesting once again, I felt relaxed and in a good mood, I enjoyed my food probably for the first time in years, and felt like myself again.

So I asked for some more. It's been two months now, I have been taking one 220 pill every day, spread in two doses. I won't say that I am absolutely 100% recovered, some of the initial effects faded away with continuos dosing, but at least I want to live now, and I have pleasant moments during my day, engaging conversations, and a will to do stuff. My physical symptoms are mostly gone, and mentally I am a lot more stable.

Now, maybe I will get addicted to mephedrone. I guess I am already addicted to my psych meds. Whats the difference? One is legal one is not. I don't care, weapons are bad yet countries go to war. I definitely do not have a moral problem with this. I'll continue doing what works for me, day by day. Not wanting to kill myself is a big step forward.

So there, thats my story. Feel free to comment or DM me for questions or if you need someone to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*Also please, if you attempt to do this, DO NOT snort mephedrone. \*\*\*\*

Snorting mephedrone is associated with compulsive redosing which can make you end up in a hospital due to stimulant induced psychosis, specially if you are predisposed to it. My suggestion is, if you do this (and I am not recommending you to do it, just doing some harm prevention), start very slow, like a quarter of a pill (50mg) for examaple and work your way from there next day.",27Jan2019,1

I'm very bubbly and try my best to keep a good personality at my workplace. It's gotten me far with the management and I've gotten a lot of promotions because of it. However, there are instances where my coworker interactions make me feel like ... trash. 

For example, today. Instead of there being calm discussion about WHY something was mixed up, my coworker decided to come up to me and yell ""What the fuck is wrong with you. What is going on"" in front of customers. Not the greatest way to go about that situation. Followed by the same coworker calling me dumb when I accidentally spilled a drink. This is a coworker that I sometimes have a lighthearted joke with here and there, but never so much for her to yell at me in front of customers and for her to call me dumb.

100,"I apologize in advance for this being practically an essay and also because I don't know if this is worth posting or if this is the right sub for it, but still.

I've recently had a life altering event happen with my fiance, and I'm trying to change my course for the better but I'm stuck between trying to understand if my past actions were because I'm just a messed up person or if I'm mentally ill. 

I am seeing a therapist but we have yet to form a diagnosis, but I was wondering how YOU all feel about it. I can list all of my past behavior in bullet points to make this easier. 

Background information: we've come to the conclusion that something inside me gives me almost 0 control over impulses. I also have a problem with substance abuse, maybe those go hand in hand. I struggle with anxiety and depression, feelings of emptiness and complete lack of self esteem. I've struggled with those feelings since childhood, and  was never given care for them. I struggled with the to-be-mentioned behavior since my teenage years into young adulthood, but just now had this realization that I'm a bad person. it's also worth noting that I now 100% regret every choice I've made and feel so much remorse over it all, but spent years not giving a single fuck. so here we go. 



1. I've cheated on many many partners, solely to benefit myself with feelings of validation from multiple people, or just to feel SOMETHING. 

2. I've impulsively messaged tons of both men and women in an attempt to flirt, just so I can feel wanted and loved, even if I had plenty of friends and family or a boyfriend/girlfriend who cared about me.

3. I've used so many people for drugs, sex, attention, etc. just because I felt like that's the only way I could function. I've also charged my own family members and friends gas money just to buy drugs after bringing them to wherever they're going.

4. ive had all of these things done to me as well, yet I continued to reciprocate that terrible behavior onto others without a care. 

5. I've lied to people about my feelings towards them to make THEM feel wanted, but ended up leaving them in the dust shortly after.

6. I've made myself seem like a totally different person than I really am just so I can have people tell me what a nice person I am, even though I quite obviously was not.


the general gist of this is that a lot of my poor choices were sexually based or based on a need to feel anything or just feel like I have someone's attention. 

now for possible explanations for my behavior. 

1. I was abused as a child by one of my parents, physically and psychologically, and also into adolescence (mostly psychologically at that point)

2. I was raped in my teenage years. not much more context needed there.

3. I started drugs very early, namely weed, which moved on to anything under the sun aside from H, crack and meth. I also spent years addicted to both opiates and pharmaceutical amphetamines. 

4. I spent around a year as an alcoholic and trying to hide it (most recent substance issue)

5. I was psychologically abused in a handful of relationships as well and apparently have poor understanding of how they're supposed to work.

6. All of my issues have been bottled up and gone unchecked. I've never had professional help, or really anyone that I felt like I could vent to. now my time and I both think these were all MASSIVE contributors to my behavior.  ",27Jan2019,1

Ever since I can remember I've had this ability to change the way I perceive space. It is very hard to explain, but the most accurate explanation I can give is I can perceive what the world would look like if everything shifted 90 degrees. Like north becomes east, east becomes south and so on. And so I can get 3 types of these perceptions apart from the normal one. Nothing materially changes in the room I'm in. I would shift constantly between these perceptions as a child but then I stopped doing it. Recently I started doing it again and saw that these perceptions gave me mood swings. One of them makes me intensely elated in a nostalgic sort of way, and one of them makes me gloomy and depressed the entire time I'm in the perception of space. It's harder to switch now so I get stuck with them for days at a time and it's making me neurotic. Ive never read of this anywhere, so any help, even speculation would be very appreciated.

I’m a very introspective person. To the point where I think my way into an existential crisis daily. I’m 23F, diagnosed as bipolar ii, anxiety, and adhd. Nothing in this world makes sense to me. And I just want to die because nothing in this life matters to me.

Last night I cut my wrists thinking that I could kill myself. But I guess I’m not even strong enough to do that. I called 911 and they took me to a mental hospital. Only to be sent home because I’m on too many meds for their team to deal with. When I got home this morning i realized that everything was left in the bathroom. Knife, razors, blood and all. And I just don’t understand why none of the 6 officers/medics that were in my tiny apartment could clean them up. Now I’m left wondering if I can even clean all that shit up myself or if I will end up going back to cutting in the process. I don’t have friends or family who could help either.

This episode really came out of the blue. I had a one prior cutting episode when I was 17(6yrs ago). That time it was a release but this time I really just wanted to end it all. I don’t really feel like killing myself right now but that’s only because I don’t think I’m strong enough to succeed.

I don’t really know what the point of posting this is but I guess I just wanted to know if anyone had suggestions on what to do when it feels like there’s no where to go for help. I live in Portland, OR and not even the most reputable mental hospital here will help me to to my many meds. The resources around here seem pretty limited so I would be open to treatment facilities nearly anywhere if it meant I could get the help to get better.

I’m not going to go into all the meds because asking for psychiatric help on here would be crazy but I’d be willing to go anywhere for help. I also have issues with frequent periods and pelvic pain which contributes to the mental issues. I feel like my case is too complicated and that’s why i can’t get the help I need.

I know this post is probably really vague but I just feel like I’m hurting for no reason. I’m reaching out to my few contacts in person but I thought it wouldn’t hurt to hear suggestions/recommendations from redditors 

Thank you",27Jan2019,1
105,"Just a note, this all happened over a chat as she lives very far away. 
My girlfriend has disociative personality disorder (not diagnosed though, I suspect she is getting threatment for wrong illness) and this was the first time I met her other personalities.
The first one was the ""bitch"" who is generally the most violent one. We talked a lot, I told her I don't think she's just evil and I can accept her. Pretty much all the ""people aren't just black and white""  stuff. I was respectful and polite the whole time, I tried not to make her angry and hate me. I also told her I won't address her as a ""bitch"" because I think she doesn't deserve being called that. She said she's trying to help the main personality by showing her she doesn't have to live by rules. I cannot say I believe her, but I won't assume she's not telling the truth just because she's the bad one. 
Then she switched again, another one came around and asked me to give them all names. Again, I tried to use normal names I thought they might like, trying to make them feel like I'm okay with it all. This alter explaned she's a lot like the main girl, so she had to do something, then said she's going to give them a bath and went offline. 
I talked to my actual gf already, she's somewhat okay. I told her she doesn't need to apologize and that it's all okay, then we changed the topic. 

Well, the thing is, I want to know how I did and what to do when it happens next time. I want to be as prepared as possible.

107,"I apologize in advance for this being practically an essay AND a repost, and also because I don't know if this is worth posting or if this is the right sub for it, but still.

I've recently had a life altering event happen with my fiance, and I'm trying to change my course for the better but I'm stuck between trying to understand if my past actions were because I'm just a messed up person or if I'm mentally ill. 

I am seeing a therapist but we have yet to form a diagnosis, but I was wondering how YOU all feel about it. I can list all of my past behavior in bullet points to make this easier. 

Background information: we've come to the conclusion that something inside me gives me almost 0 control over impulses. I also have a problem with substance abuse, maybe those go hand in hand. I struggle with anxiety and depression, feelings of emptiness and complete lack of self esteem. I've struggled with those feelings since childhood, and  was never given care for them. I struggled with the to-be-mentioned behavior since my teenage years into young adulthood, but just now had this realization that I'm a bad person. it's also worth noting that I now 100% regret every choice I've made and feel so much remorse over it all, but spent years not giving a single fuck. so here we go. 



1. I've cheated on many many partners, solely to benefit myself with feelings of validation from multiple people, or just to feel SOMETHING. 

2. I've impulsively messaged tons of both men and women in an attempt to flirt, just so I can feel wanted and loved, even if I had plenty of friends and family or a boyfriend/girlfriend who cared about me.

3. I've used so many people for drugs, sex, attention, etc. just because I felt like that's the only way I could function. I've also charged my own family members and friends gas money just to buy drugs after bringing them to wherever they're going.

4. ive had all of these things done to me as well, yet I continued to reciprocate that terrible behavior onto others without a care. 

5. I've lied to people about my feelings towards them to make THEM feel wanted, but ended up leaving them in the dust shortly after.

6. I've made myself seem like a totally different person than I really am just so I can have people tell me what a nice person I am, even though I quite obviously was not.


the general gist of this is that a lot of my poor choices were sexually based or based on a need to feel anything or just feel like I have someone's attention. 

now for possible explanations for my behavior. 

1. I was abused as a child by one of my parents, physically and psychologically, and also into adolescence (mostly psychologically at that point)

2. I was raped in my teenage years. not much more context needed there.

3. I started drugs very early, namely weed, which moved on to anything under the sun aside from H, crack and meth. I also spent years addicted to both opiates and pharmaceutical amphetamines. 

4. I spent around a year as an alcoholic and trying to hide it (most recent substance issue)

5. I was psychologically abused in a handful of relationships as well and apparently have poor understanding of how they're supposed to work.

6. All of my issues have been bottled up and gone unchecked. I've never had professional help, or really anyone that I felt like I could vent to. now my time and I both think these were all MASSIVE contributors to my behavior.  ",27Jan2019,1
108,"Hello all,

I'm \[27M\] one who gets attached really easily and really deeply. I was seeing a girl casually for the last few months, but we really clicked and all signs pointed towards relationship, the caveat being we never had a talk. What seemed like overnight, our dynamic had changed and after a couple of weeks of being what I felt was shouldered, I asked her about it because I wanted to resume our ""relationship"". She told me her ex came back into the picture and that she was going to give it another try with him, then proceeded with placating me about how much she likes me but she has chosen him.

&amp;#x200B;

This has absolutely devastated me, and for more reasons than one. I am absolutely terrible at dealing with these emotions and in the past it has lead to some terrible self-destructive behavior as coping mechanisms and only resolved with time passing rather than me actually doing anything about it. I have come to realize I have abandonment issues because I am affected by this way more than what should be considered as normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am completely devastated. I am experiencing an existential crisis, I am depressed, haven't been eating, suffering from major panic attacks all week and have performed at my work to a bare minimum, losing all interest in it. I am currently studying on the other side of the country from my family and friends, and this is further making me sad. I was left for another guy by my last ex which sparked my last bout with these feelings which lasted about 10 months and they were the darkest times of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the good part: I recognize that I'm heading back into these feelings and I absolutely do not want to go there again. I need help and I have sought it by immediately seeing a therapist, and running to the doctor twice last week when I experienced a panic attack. They have referred me to a psychiatrist to address any underlying issues, and have so far provided some anti-depression medication but it apparently takes 4-6 weeks to kick in. I have another therapist meeting tomorrow and I do have friends here and I have reached out to them, and I have called my sister, though this is all very hard because all of this is very heavy and they're all very new friends to me.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling better when with these people helping me, I just can not be alone right now. What can I do when inevitably at the end of the night I have to go back alone to my apartment. I'm kind of left thinking of her again and how she's with him. Please help me with any exercises or advice to bare being alone and in between therapy sessions, I don't want to experience this all over again :(

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much.

114,"I still remember the first time I saw your self harm scars running down your arms. They matched the ones on my legs. I remember the first promise we made to each other, to stop cutting for each other. After years of pointless therapists, I found  someone who got me,, who had been  through the same shit as I had. Little the first of your games. I remember when we got milkshakes together, it was the first time you ate what you wanted without throwing up in the bathroom afterwards. But later that night you still cut, and you blamed me. You said if I ever tried to get you fat again, you'd cut even deeper. Of course I was so blinded I agreed. I remember when you found out about the girl in my study group, you found out we revised together. Apparently this was cheating, so yet again you cut. You made me leave the group and block her. You knew all my passwords, all my pins. And you changed things and blocked people as you saw fit. But I also remember when you crossed the line for me, you attacked my mother. I said things I still regret, and I will always be sorry to you for that. But that didn't justify you sending my scar pictures to my friend, exposing my darkest secret. But yet again, you apologised the next day and I was too blinded to move on. 
But now I'm done. I've blocked you on everything. I've cut off contact with all your toxic friends. I'm done. But I love you. I think I always will deep down. You're the first one I ever opened up to. You'll always be in my heart for that reason. I hope you do recover, I know you're so clever and you want to go to medical school, and I know you can do it.

116,"Hi! So this is my first post on Reddit, so I'm sorry for any format errors, but I'd like to get some perspective. Also, sorry about the length lol.

\*This post is not meant to attack, antagonize, or defame any individuals of any communities that I mention. I am simply theorizing and looking to gather information and insight into the effects these communities may have on quality of life and socialization. Also, any information posted here is strictly for my own understanding and for others who find this. 

So I'm a psych student exploring connections between social media and mental health. It's always fascinated me, but there are some apparent dilemmas with social media, like communities that enable unhealthy coping mechanisms, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. I know first hand: when I first entered college, I became extremely anorexic and I used online communities, like ProAna on Tumblr and making boards on Pinterest, to feed my obsessions. I tried to justify seeking out these communities for the ""social support"", but I finally acknowledged later that they weren't supporting me, they were supporting my habits and enabling my unhealthy behaviors. Getting rid of my social media accounts was a huge step in getting my life back and it took some time for me to get my head straight before I could return. Now I'd like to explore the matter further. 

There are lots of pros and cons to social media communities, but I really want to get at the cyclical push-and-pull that keeps people (like I used to be) in a state of satisfaction online and then hopelessness in real life. Like the Incel community, for example. Similarly to ProAna, it seems to feed off of each other's dreams in unhealthy ways. When I was part of ProAna, my dream was to be skinny because I grew up being bullied for my weight and thought that being anorexic would provide me with validation, acknowledgement, and fulfillment for my loneliness. I perceive this in the Incels: they have been fed negative messages that have deeply, perhaps traumatically, affected them. Part of their dream is to fulfill their loneliness, to be accepted and validated, and to be desired. But because these dreams aren't being met, they fester into resentment. Online, they can share that resentment with others, which fans the fire. 

The more we come into contact with others who share our misery, the more power that bitterness can hold over our lives and it damages our self-esteem, quality of life, and ability to socialize comfortably offline. So then we retreat back online because (1) it's easier and more comfortable because no one is harming us to our faces, (2) the communities we find on there are more sympathetic/relevant to our troubles, and (3) these communities seem to have answers that we need to find closure. At least, this was my experience.

I have a couple of ideas about all of this, but a major contributor to my motivation for understanding is the concept of *adverse childhood experiences* (ACEs) based on the 1995-1997 CDC-Kaiser study, which deserves to be discussed here. Basically, when we have traumatic experiences in our childhood, our developing stress system is impacted depending on the degree/length of time we are exposed. This dysfunctional rewiring of our stress response contributes to a number of wellness issues both physically and psychologically that affect us throughout our life. Think about seeing a bear in the woods. It's terrifying, yeah? Now imagine that same response *becoming a part of you*. You're always anxious - unable to really relax or enjoy pleasure raw. Your amygdali (aka aggression/emotion center) are in perpetual use, which cuts down on executive functioning to make way for more stress hormones. The effects of this dysfunction includes higher risks of addiction, heart diseases, depression, financial stress, anxiety, violence, and suicide, among other things. (I highly recommend Dr. Nadine Burke Harris's book, *The Deepest Well*, for a more thorough understanding.)

Another contributor is rumination. It is not limited to just memories; it is also a current obsession that leads to how things could get worse. A castraphisation. “Rumination is what you do when you repeatedly relive an experience in your mind, replaying it, reviewing it, and reinterpreting it. It plays a major role in depression—pushing people over the edge from a temporary sad mood into a major, lasting sadness. The habit can also turn a nervous person into someone truly suffering from anxiety” (McGowan, 2005). Essentially, your anger is postponed in the moment of an event and it continues to boil around in you until it is redirected towards another outlet, usually in an aggressive form because the kinetic energy in your body is practically begging for force. 

This falls in line with the *Cognitive Neoassociation Theory* (Berkowitz, 2012), which refers to the relation from anger to aggression - aka venting. Adverse events, like frustration or a high temperature, stimulate stress response tendencies, which is discharged via amygdala/aggression form. This theory speculates that venting is not a healthy form of discharge because it is essentially the practice of aggressive behavior: when people vent, they are usually behaving aggressively towards objects, like pillows or empty space or other people. Venting could mean punching pillows, breaking things, or screaming, but they all have one categorical intention in common: rumination, Also regret. In exacerbating an angry mood, we are rooting ourselves in circumstances that have come and passed and will continue to occur throughout life. Whether or not they can be changed comes down to context - i.e., fixing a broken relationship or working out - but regardless, evidence suggests that these are the conditions under which our aggression builds. 

So basically, this has led me to my theory that social media communities can exacerbate unhealthy coping mechanisms, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Of course, this is just a small portion of the contents of my theory, but that would take a long time to go into detail lol. Maybe I'll write a paper about it eventually. 

But anyway, I'd like some perspective on this. I think that social media is possibly the greatest tool of all time, but everything's got a flaw and who best to ask than people who have experience with it? It's a super complex issue and there's so many components that intersect! 

What do you all think about this? What do you perceive as social media's benefits and detriments to our psyche? If you have had a similar experience, how did you overcome it? Any advice or suggestions?

Thank you! :)

Hi everyone. I'm a semi-functioning 32f with clinical depression and borderline personality disorder. I have a ft job that I love, and they are very accommodating to my mental health. I am in a happy relationship (2 years in March), we have an apartment and 3 cats together; we each have our own car. We're talking about having a baby, and have been actively trying. My cycle is out of wack because I was on birth control pills since I was 18, and only stopped taking them this August.

Things are great on the surface, right? I have been struggling with my mental health really badly these past 2 months or so. I have taken time off work due to it. Only used 2 sick days, and the rest has been due to a lack of work at my company. I have a few days of work coming up and then I will be off for 7 days for a mini staycation.

While things are relatively fine, our home is a bit of a mess. Our bedroom is an organization disaster. We have laundry to be done (his task), but we have shared laundry in this building and we never get an opportunity to use the machines, because they are always in use by the other tenants.

We were looking at buying a house before Christmas. We paused the search due to other financial obligations. He bought a brand new car at the end of the year, so now we have put the search on a hiatus. Which is fine, it gives us the opportunity to save up, because our rent is super cheap.

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. I guess I just needed a vent. I don't have a therapist anymore, because the one I had was just a social worker and meant for ""short term"". I'm going to talk to my doctor about an increase on my SSRI, or possibly a different medication. But I don't want to be on anything too high that would need to be decreased once I get pregnant.. Well, if, I guess.

I've been crying a lot. Feeling hopeless. Worthless. Wanting to hurt myself and generally not be around anymore. I have been a bit irratic lately, but in private. My partner doesn't even know that I have been mixing pills with alcohol, as well as pot (it's legal here 🇨🇦). I don't want to die, but often I am crying to myself telling me as such, that I wish I was dead. I find myself struggling to get through many days. I just feel so lost. I haven't done anything I have wanted to do in life. I thought I would have had 3 kids by this point in my life, but I made many stupid decisions in relationships. Not with this one, though. But I still wonder if he wishes he chose someone else, or maybe he feels like he can't leave me. He tells me otherwise when I ask, but I dunno.

Life hurts, man. I was born with a condition that caused me to have arthritis at an early age. It is manageable with regular painkillers, but the older I get, the more pain I get. I have trouble using stairs, I have to take them one step at a time (one foot up, next foot to same step, repeat). I need to push a shopping cart when shopping, to help my balance.

Ugh, I dunno guys. I'm just rambling I think. My partner doesn't understand mental health, and I don't know how to help him understand it.

I don't know what I'm even posting for. I just don't know what I'm doing or why I feel this way. I just wish I was ""normal"". I want a baby so badly, before my body shuts down even more. I am still physically capable of a lot of things, we even go to the gym to try to help with my knees. But I worry. I'm lost, lol. ",27Jan2019,1
