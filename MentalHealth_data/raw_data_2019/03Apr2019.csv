0,"This may sound odd but my dog is causing me severe anxiety but not in the way you would think. We’ve had our dog for a few months, he is fine just a puppy doing puppy things, but recently I’ve been feeling really off about him. I’ll be sitting at home and all of sudden I’m filled with severe impending doom like a mini panic attack because he exist. It’s like my mind can’t comprehend that he is our dog. Every time I play with him I think he shouldn’t exist when I imagine him in my head he’s like an indescribable blur. I feel like I’m losing my mind, everything was fine a few weeks ago. But now i get uneasy whenever I’m around him. Not sure if this is right place to post but I don’t know what’s wrong with me.",03Apr2019,1
1,"I was going to cross post this from where I posted it in /r autism but couldn't figure it out, so I'm just posting it here too.

I created this account specifically to ask for other opinions on what is going on with me currently. Not really a throw away account just didn’t want it tied to my other one.

I’m a 33-year-old male. I’ve been in and out of therapy for the past 7 years after the failure of my first marriage. I’m married and have two young kids. I’ve done personal and couples counseling throughout that time and never really felt like I’ve gotten much out of it. Looking back, I’m able to deal with my relationships better and it has improved a lot of aspects in my life, but I feel like I still struggle with a lot of the same core issues. I recently (past 4 months or so) have started with a new therapist and it’s going well. I’m doing twice a week therapy session which isn’t fun, but I kind of view it like working out. Don’t like it, but it overall is a better when I’m doing it rather than not.

I have recently come to realize how emotionally unavailable my parents were growing up and that I have a significant number of traumatic events from early childhood that I have never really dealt with. I did a lot of public speaking and 4-H stuff growing up. Reached the top leadership positions in the State, but a lot of that was driven by my mother’s desires rather than my own. I was in leadership organization in college and did that sort of stuff, but I’ve always struggled with fitting in. Make friends (I don’t have many close friends) became especially difficult after college. I’ve struggled in all my jobs and have had bad interpersonal interactions in almost all my jobs. I finally quit the 9-5 and have been a stay at home dad and consultant for the past 4 years. Last year I started looking for jobs and being very intentional in trying to go back to a corporate setting. It’s been a struggle, especially since what I did if a very niche industry. Just a little back story there.

What brings me here today is…recently through some off the cuff comment from my wife (“are you autistic?”). I actually stopped to think about it, so I did some research. Read a bunch of articles and then ended up on YouTube listening to adult diagnosis stories of people with ASD. A lot of their experiences resonated, and I related to them quite strongly. I did more research and took a couple of online ASD evaluations ( Aspie-Quiz [http://www.rdos.net/eng/quizh8.php](http://www.rdos.net/eng/quizh8.php), etc.) . All things pointed that I should get this check out and that I might be on the spectrum.

I talked to my therapist who wasn’t really keen on the idea, but I kept insisting that I wanted to confirm or rule it out. Finally he presented me with two options one was a traditional diagnostician and the other was a therapeutic diagnostic approach. I chose the therapeutic approach since it seemed like I would have more chance to explain myself and could then loop my therapist in after the testing to target treatment. I went in and did a ASD exam very similar in length and content to the Aspie-Quiz followed by close to 4 hours of personality interview, and at the end took a another test focused on social anxiety disorder related content.

I had the consult with the diagnostician and my therapist today to go over the results. The social anxiety testing showed I had significant social impairments, but an average (within norms) level of anxiety. My aggression and something else closely related to it was abnormally low (like almost non-existent) which the diagnostician dismissed based on his time talking with me. We went over the personality testing which wasn’t a huge surprise basically most of what I knew or have come to realize about myself in therapy over the last 7 years. We then came to the autism evaluation. It was based on my answers about how I view myself. I scored 153 out of 160+ (I’m not sure what the end of the scale was but it was between 160-170). The diagnostician then quickly told me that he strongly not advised me to self-identify as someone on the spectrum or report myself as on the spectrum to anyone. He viewed it like my low scores on the social anxiety questionnaire as an outlier and not to be paid attention to really. He suggested instead that I “might have an avoidance personality”. He didn’t say that I had Avoidance Personality Disorder in our meeting, but I came home and studied it like crazy. I have very low view of myself and struggle with my identity, but I just don’t relate to what I’m seeing the way I did with information about late in life autism diagnosis. He still has to finish his summary, and this consultation what just one of the closing steps in the evaluation to go over the data. I was hoping for a yes or no on social anxiety and autism, and maybe some guides for what it could be, but this result is confusing and really open ended to me I’m not sure where to go from here.

Thus I come for your opinions. How do I score so high on the autism evaluation and just have it ignored because I have developed low level competency with general social skills. Maybe it isn’t autism, but I don’t understand the results. It might be AVPD but I just don’t feel like it’s a fit. Yeah similar but….?

I meet again with my therapist in a couple days to unpack and await the summary. Do you think I should seek further testing for ASD? Is there a overlap or comorbidity with ASD and AVPD? AVPD doesn’t seem really solid or the research for it a priority which is may be why I’m struggling to see this, but I just don’t understand  not diving into the ASD result and comparing them or testing them further to differentiate ASD from the AVPD idea.

Any thoughts, kind words, resources, or similar experiences would really help right now. If you made it this far I’m sorry It was so long. I hope it all made sense. Thanks!",03Apr2019,1
2,okay so. nothing necessarily *bad* has happened in my life but i just find myself always tired and drained of energy or stressed. idk whats wrong with me but i literally never want to do anything anymore and i hate just getting up every morning doing the same thing day after day. im bored of life and im stressed with school and i have no motivation to do  a n y t h i n g. im so tired of this and idk maybe its just school or whatever idk,03Apr2019,1

4,"This may be very long and im not an english speaker. Sorry if i make big mistakes.

Im 17 turning 18 now btw.
I have always been a very social guy, never had problems talking to people. I wasnt the most popular guy, but always had a group of friends and partners with who i could talk. That was just because i used to hide my real self. My family has always been kinda chaotic, thats why i tried to make so many bonds with other people, just to stay away from my family. But i cant do it anymore. I cant  help people and hide my real feelings anymore.

I do not know why, but in the last months im getting depressed always. I have gone from being outside with my group of friends 24/7, to making up excuses to not go outside home. I just want to be in my room all day closed. The less i comunicate with others the better.
Also i broke up with my gf (you know the typical highscool love that u think it is never gonna end?) She and i were very close to eachother, but i dont know why i decided to break up. I didnt want to meet her anymore, i didnt want to talk her anymore, it was very hard for me, and i know it was for her too, so i decided to end it.

Its like no one matters for me anymore, i cant express my feelings, i just want to cry and get someone to notice my problems, but at the same time i distance myself more and more.
I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. Why im here? Which is my purpose? So much hypocresy everywhere. Almost everyone has wrong thoughts about me. Because i have been lying all my life. I dont even know who is the real me. Should i try to be around people, being the funny guy or should i stay at home thinking about the purpose of life? The later is the real me, but everyone knows me as the funny guy, etc...

I dont know why my life has changed so suddenly. (i will call myself K now to make things simpler) Its like the real K wants to express his feelings, but i have been another person for my whole life. Was she in love with me? Or with the person i prettended to be? The same applies to my friends and partners. 

I am in a huge conflict with myself. I know everyone hides things behind a mask, but im totally another person. No one knows my real self, the one who enjoys watching films all-day and likes to hear to jazz music. Everyone knows me as K, the reliable guy, the one who can  joke to make you laugh even at the worse moments, the hardcore basketball fan. And i just dont know who i should be. 
In conclusion, as i have said before, the real K is depressed af and wants to cut all type of relationship, but the K everyone thinks i am, even my family, has been ""missing"" for almost a whole year. Im losing everyone for being myself, and it hurts the most to them. I dont know what to do. 

Im in a point where i dont even mind losing people, but i dont want people to lose me. 
Maybe it has been a rough reading as i didnt know how to express things in english. But i hope u read everything and try to help me. 

As im writing the last paragraph one of my closest friend and my ex gf sent me a message, how ironic...but im a coward,i cant answer, instead of comunicating with them, im going to watch ""Mystic River"" for like the 50th time...why i cant answer them? I dont want to...they are not typing K, instead they are typing another person who is lost and confused..",03Apr2019,1

# The war inside

&amp;#x200B;

How can she love anyone else,

when all she feels is hate,

and disappointment of herself,

her heart will just deflate.

&amp;#x200B;

The monsters in her head feels real.

They tell her everyone;

will surely see the ugliness,

and then they'll scream and run.

&amp;#x200B;

In the nights she truly believes,

the voices in her head.

They say that she's unloveable.

They keep her in her bed.

&amp;#x200B;

In the sun she’s out with friends and laughing,

but moon and stars brings fear and lonely tears.

She used to love watching the moon and stars,

but now they just remind her she can’t sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

When her head and heart are at full out war,

what should she trust, and what should she ignore?  

&amp;#x200B;

Her                is a

mind              minefield,

&amp;#x200B;

 a                         stress.

mess of   

&amp;#x200B;

corrupts                     

Monsters                        her heart.

&amp;#x200B;

  So                   can she,

how

6,"Never posted here before. Sorry if this is the wrong forum. I have been diagnosed with depression with psychosis and a panic disorder. 

My psychiatrist from a couple of years ago was the WORST. She had four offices, and any time I needed a refill I had to call all of them. Always took days. also, when I told her I was dating a woman ( am female) she asked me if that was the same as being polyamorous and also be told me that it must be so hard for me to be bi because I must just find everyone attractive. She never remembered my name or details.

I am finally on my own health insurance, but the mental health system for my employer is awful. I have called upwards of 12 providers covered by my insurance and non were taking new clients.

This is the kind of shit that is horrible for people already dealing with mental health issues. It is SI hard for me to call people. Calling 12 people for help and being denied it is hell.

7,"This is going to be a weird way to ask this question but I hope it makes sense.

I was walking home the other day and had to cross the parking lot ""street"" that splits two rows of parking spots. I looked left, the direction that traffic in the closest ""lane"" would be coming from (from behind me). I started cross before looking right (oncoming traffic, the direction I was walking), which is really stupid and i dont recommend* it.

As i looked right I saw a car coming. My body instinctively stopped me and I stepped back. This person was speeding and looking down. If they were going slower I would have made it across in time, or if they were paying attention they would have been able to stop because of my stupidity. 

My first reaction was ""dang that could have been bad"" but then my second reaction was more of ""dang I could have died finally"".

Okay Raven Dementia Way we get it you're edgy. But for a moment I was disappointed that it didn't happen.

I am a currently psych student, and have been living with depression since childhood (28 now). I have no plan or ideation to harm or kill myself. But dang if I wasn't disappointed that I still have bills.

I do have a therapist but cannot see them because of no insurance (working on it, hopefully in a month or so). I am on steady medication prescribed by a psychiatrist though and I see them monthly. 

I don't think I'm a danger to myself. But there was that fraction of a second where I could have ""done it"", and that scares me a bit.

(*I would recommend following pedestrian safety rules though, which include walking against traffic. I was crossing because my building is on the opposite side of where the bus drops off.)",03Apr2019,1
8,"I am in the USA and looking for a birth control option that will not result in my feeling depressed 24-7. Specifically, I am taking birth control for the reason of needing to regulate my horrendous periods and lessen the amount of severe pain I am in each month and the amount of blood I lose. When not on medication, I bleed through 16 pads per day - approximately one per half hour. (I am not comfortable wearing tampons nor any internal capturing device, so these are out of the question for me.) When also not on any medication for my hormones/periods, I use a TENS unit to help mitigate the amount of pain I am in each month. Without the TENS unit, I would not be able to even move due to the severity of my pain.

I have tried one birth control YEARS ago that I cannot remember the name of that gave me even worse depression than I am dealing with now from this current medication, and I am currently using Taytulla, which is still giving me a side effect of depression on a daily basis. I am currently almost done with my second month of Taytulla out of a three-month plan a previous doctor gave to me. The first month on the medication I didn't stop bleeding except for about four days out of the month; second month I seem to be normal and not bleeding; throughout both months I have been dealing with extreme depression and suicidal thoughts. I am open to both pharmaceuticals and/or holistic approaches - whatever can help balance my hormones and not wack out my brain chemistry is what I'm looking for.",03Apr2019,1

10,"I'm at a loss. I am have a past history of mental health issues and was previously prescribed zoloft, welbutrin, tegetrol, seroquel, and celexa. I had zero luck with any of those.

But no doctors around here will dare prescribe that to me again. So for 10 years I've just dealt with it. And every, single, day, I feel like I can't do it anymore.

11,"Hi there! I'm located in the state of Indiana in the United States. I have struggled with body dysmorphia and an eating disorder for years. I had most of this treated when I was college, and got to a healthier, more stable point. Fast forward a few years, and I go to see a nutritionist on tips to eat healthier, when---surprise!, I'm still practicing many restrictive habits (and truthfully I never got over the body dysmorphia part as I constantly think about my appearance, pick at my body, and look at mirrors at my flaws). It was recommended to me that I seek a mental health professional as my nutritionist can only do so much. It's been a frustrating attempt to find one. I used to have a therapist, but we stopped sessions after a point because I was fairly stable and she didn't specialize in eating disorders or bdd. I'm running into the same problem now--the therapists who could see me and I could afford won't touch eating disorder cases and the eating disorder/bdd clinics in my area won't give me the time of day because they don't carry my insurance. I'm reluctant to drop my insurance because it allows me to pay next to nothing for medication and doctor's visits, and if I get insurance the clinics I want to visit will take, chances are that I will pay much more for my general health visits and medications. Essentially, I'm choosing between my physical health and mental health. Welcome to the messed up world of American health insurance! Is there a reason so many therapists won't help me? Does anyone have any advice on getting the help I need? I've done 'talk therapy' in the past with little results and feel that the cognitive behavioral therapy that is offered in many eating disorder treatments would be far more helpful. This is especially difficult now as the diet plan my nutritionist has set up for me really takes me out of my comfort zone and has been distressing. I've been having many more meltdowns about my appearance lately. It would be nice to have the mental side addressed otherwise, I may quit seeing the nutritionist so I can stop having to eat so much as it is setting me off. ",03Apr2019,1

13,"In therapy group at the hospital they showed us this educational video from PBS where they discuss emotion, psychology, and the brain. In the video they interview this professor who wrote a book called “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers.” It brings up the idea that humans are the only living things with such complex emotions and because of this we dwell and ruminate and it takes a toll; a Zebra, however, can go from eating grass to escaping a lion attack, only to happily go back to eating grass again once safe as though nothing happened. I thought this was really interesting and it brought with it the motto: Be a zebra. When you’re attacked by life, as hard as it is to let it go, if you can be a zebra and move forward leaving the negative experience in the past then it’s not as terrible. I don’t know if that makes sense to you but it really helped me. It’s also important to remember that as painful and difficult as it can be to simply be human, it can also be so beautiful and incredible.

Starting from last summer, I have been trying to accomplish many goals that I believe can help propel me towards the future that I want, and I had made tremendous progress during the summer. Then, I still suffered from the sleepiness issue, and I stayed away from my friends and family as much as possible to get my work done. I also wasted a lot of time just sitting around in an attempt to do my work. During this time, I was incredibly stressed out. This was not the way that I wanted to live, so I decided to make a change and hang out more. However, this had side effects. Due to my increased sociability I no longer had time to slowly trudge through my work with my tiredness and poor focus. This only worsened when school started and seven hours were suddenly cut from my day. Every day I tried to make the big change of waking up energized and giving everything my fullest, but with my busier schedule and sleepiness, I just couldn't get anything done. This is gone on from midway through August until now. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong and why I am so tired. My lack of progress makes me feel like a failure, and it feels like a pain to see my girlfriend and friends knowing that I have failed to achieve my goals.

I work for nights for a man who is paralyzed from the neck and down and his life is pure misery, he has intense pain, deals with problems that make my own problems seem insignificant, yet he seems to be faring better than I am mentally.

I spend my days playing video games and smoking weed. The thing about video games for me is that I am very good at it, I know I could go pro if I really wanted it - but I don't want to. The only real escape I have from ""reality"" is smoking weed, because when I do smoke then I feel incredibly at ease and I can somewhat enjoy my lifestyle.  


My family knows about what I do with the weed and video gaming, my brother and sister knows a bit about my depression, but sadly they have their own mental health issues, so I know that they feel like they can't really help me.  


The only times I really feel any emotions right now is if I have a long sequence of pop-off gaming or if I watch anime and there's a really really happy or really really sad moment and even then, the emotions feel very... numbed down.  


I'm not sure how to proceed because, frankly, I stopped caring about living a regular life a long time ago. I've stopped caring about finding a relationship. I've stopped eating healthy and the only real exercise I get nowadays is the 25 minute walk to work.  


Then again everything is not all bad, I have a good connection with all of my family members and we all love each other. My brother, my sister and I are moving in together on a farm that we'll take care of and that's been the one thing that I've looked forward to. Maybe if I live closely with other people I can start feeling again.  


Also suicide is something I'm not interested of. I had a phase in my teens when I was close to committing suicide, but during that phase I got to realize that if I take my life I'm not just ending my own. I'm ruining my family's life.

23,"Over the past 4 years I've been on a downward spiral with my mental health and life but although there have been dark times, there's also been some fun times along the way

In 2014 I was a smiling guy, I had a girlfriend, my own place, family home at my dad's where I could visit and good friends 

Now in 2019 looking back it feels like that was a different life, like I'm someone else. 

I'm constantly battling trying to maintain a routine and lifestyle whilst also battling inside feelings. 

Feeling like I'm working away from home and want to return but realising that I am home, this is my life.

So basically, the happy guy I was in 2014 had to face the fact my father's cancer was getting worse, which is where I began falling. 

In 2015 he sadly passed away and eventually our home had to be sold to pay the mortgage off to the bank. 

I stayed there until I was forced to move out as I was against selling it but, taking on a mortgage lender with no money and unfortunately without a personal army I wouldn't of got far 

By late 2015 I found myself living in a shared building, owning your own room but sharing the kitchen and bathrooms. 

I was sad every week but kept going, working, taking care of myself and socialising. 

Then Christmas hit and I realised for the first time in my life, I was alone for Christmas. 

Normally I'd be happy singing Christmas songs, handing out gifts, writing cards joyful about the season 

But instead I found myself sat in the town centre staring at the towns Christmas tree crying 

This is when I started drinking alot

By Christmas day I was sat alone, broke, miserable with a cheap microwave roast chicken dinner I'd bought 

Unfortunately I kept up drinking, it created a false sense of happiness like entering the matrix one minute I was sad the next smiling singing and feeling joy 

By Christmas 2016 I had changed jobs thinking I change of work would help me but it didn't I eventually spent another Christmas alone 

Within a few months of 2017 I had a breakdown and self harmed, having never done it before it shattered me, my confidence and ability to even go outside 

I didn't go to work as I was unable to explain my wounds to myself let alone anyone else 

Within a few weeks my rent caught up with me and I was asked to leave where I was living 

Due to life moving at a fast pace I was unable to try get help or recover by the time a local service offered me help I'd gone 30 miles away to sofa surf on a woman's sofa I'd only met once before 

I found myself in a village away from my home town, no one knew me and everything was new and different 

This was amazing, I felt better for the change, soon the idea I needed help or was suffering with problems was replaced by a sense of adventure 

Whilst here I decided to go on a walk to a different village which Google said was only an hour away but I took a wrong turn

Leading me to a fracking protest

I was given vegetable curry, a cup of tea and welcomed warmly 

Unfortunately I was dressed like a chav in jogger bottoms, an addidas top and trainers whilst everyone else looked like farmers/hippies 

I was told local news was coming to film the protesters holding a torch light singing event but I didn't stay for it 

I always regret not been on TV 

Within a few months of sofa surfing in the village I received a phone call telling me my grandfather had sadly passed away 

Having not been around due to my own problems I blamed myself, feeling down I felt suddenly alone in the village so went back to my home town

It was then that I found myself homeless, although I had technically been for a few months I'd not had sleep outside

For two nights I lay in between a wall and a grassy verge with only a few coats to keep me warm, both mornings awaking shaking 

On the third morning I went to a local homeless centre where I was able to get a warm meal and given a voucher for another meal at a charity sponsored cafe 

Over the course of the next month I began dealing with my situation 

Losing another family member, feeling down and finding yourself homeless is a big cataclysm of things to deal with 

Although struggling at first I began seeing it as an adventure to try make my situation easier to cope with 

My new home was next to a bridge hidden from sight, I now had a sleeping bag and began collecting random things I'd find walking about 

When you have nothing and no one to turn to, it's easy to feel depressed, miserable almost sub human 

Worst thing is trying to get help in that situation, when your local council tell you 'your not a priority' it's disheartening 

But over time things became better

After nearly a month an old friend let me sleep at hers told me to get a shower washed my clothes and made me feel human again 

The next day I emailed an old employer got an interview and began working again 

Soon I had my own place and things felt good 

But I hadn't dealt with my problems still, everything had distracted me

When I was homeless I was focused on survival day to day 

When I sofa surfed in a village it was an adventure into the unknown 

But now after many months I found myself not getting back on with life but becoming who I was before all my problems began 

Feeling like I work away from home and would like to go home but I can't, seeing family's on Facebook enjoying meals together spending time, celebrating birthdays 

More and and more I began feeling down again and lost 

When you work full time you want to feel like it's worth it, but you can't buy family

Although I had and have friends it's not the same, unconditional love can't be replaced easily, a face you've known your whole life a person who'll stand beside you no matter what 

Eventually that feeling, a sense I didn't really exist brought me into a roller coaster year

2018

I visited a doctor at the start of the year for mental health help, but because I used alcohol as a coping method I was sent to a alcohol/drug specialist 

Unfortunately they didn't have a meeting for me for over 3 months 

Within less than that I'd gone off the rails, self harmed again, trying to build a den in the woods thinking I'd run away 

This continued through out the year, I'd be fine for a month maybe two, then go off the rails 

Until I once again found myself homeless, nearly jobless, fortunately I was able to keep my job 

Whilst homeless again with a great distraction I forgot about my problems

I slept back at my old spot, found some carpet I rolled on the dirt, with some cardboard over it, with a blanket I'd stashed when I became homeless I was quite comfortable 

Once again I was homeless for just over a month 

Eventually I got another place (my fourth in 2018),settled back in and repeated everything over again 

At first sleeping on a bed, having WiFi, my own toilet was amazing but then by Christmas the same feelings took over 

Feeling like I'm working away from home and want to go home, see family, that causing depressed feelings I try deal with by drinking 

Despite this I was able to keep going until late February when I didn't get out of bed for work, it was a few days before my dad's 4th anniversary 

Now April I'm once again in a situation where I've proven I have problems 

Which because I haven't dealt with have torn me apart worn me out and spat me back out 

Obviously my solution is to get help, which I hope I find this time but my major problem is my losses in life 

That's generally my problem not having any close family, feeling alone at important times

For now however I'm signing up to volunteer and going to try get another job as once again I could possibly end up homeless (AGAIN) 

My aim of this was although things happen in life, we struggle, we feel down, we make mistakes, never ever give up always find something to keep you going 

I hope I find a sense of happiness in life so I can stop been such a roller coaster of a person and live in a straight line 

But if we all thought in straight lines and lived normal lives 

We'd probably still be living in caves 

I'll probably be living in a cave in a few weeks 😂😂😂 ",03Apr2019,1

26,"For 16 years I lived under the influence and control of my emotionally controlling and manipulative mother. It still hurts to say that about her because she was always there by my side when I was struggling, but she would use it against me every time I told her something she did was the problem. 

Anyway, she had the need to victimise herself, and instilled that into her children. Luckily I realise now what she did and the fact she victimised herself the most is what made me finally get the hell out of that situation. She always told me that I was depressed and had anxiety and that I needed to get accommodations and medication, and that I probably had bipolar disorder, etc. Everything was always a diagnosis and every feeling was always due to a mental illness. Keep in mind the doctors have always been hesitant to diagnose me with any specific mental disorder besides anxiety. 

One day I was talking to my stepmom about my mom and she told me that she just sees me as a normal teen with normal feelings who’s just learning how to manage the world. That changed me. I no longer was this “mental mess” that I had been convinced I was. I stopped trying to search if my emotions fit into a mental disorder. And mostly I realised that, yes I struggled a lot, but it wasn’t because I just had a mental illness, but it was a normal reaction to the pain of the manipulation and control I didn’t consciously realise was happening. 

A friend of mine asked if I thought maybe I had PTSD, and who knows, maybe I do. But I didn’t care about a diagnosis, I cared about addressing my emotions and not influencing my own thoughts and actions by looking into a disorder and trying to mold myself into it. It’s not erasure of the mental health problems, it’s just that i’m no longer defined by something I might have, and instead my feelings are a normal response to shitty stuff, not an uncontrollable force.

I’ve been called smart, kind, strong and all those fun things, but the nicest thing anyone ever called me is normal. Because I’m just a normal teen, living a tough life, and reacting appropriately.",03Apr2019,2

28,What do you all do to deal with neurotic insecuritie? I try so many things but I end up just crying and feeling lonely most the time. If a friend goes to hang out with other friends and I am not invited my first thought is the other people hate me. Or my friends are embarrassed of me. And idk how to deal. What should I do?

31,"So I have been continuing to improve for some time now. It has been over a year of improving, but I noticed today for the first time in many years I am able to enjoy things I used to get pleasure in doing. Not only that, but today I finally had a moment when I was eating something and though ""this is pretty good."" I'm still not eating or gaining weight back the way I would have hoped, but I am at least remembering to use MTC oil throughout the day as well as protein shake for breakfast. 

All of this has me thinking positive about the future again which is also scary. I'm kicking myself for pursuing a PsyD over a PhD but its too late in the game to look back.

I’ve been struggling with obsessive thoughts, rumination, mood swings and an overall negative outlook on life and myself for a while. I have tried different types of therapy and nothing has seemed to work enough so far. I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist last week, and he told me I should probably start taking meds. However, several people have adviced I should try cognitive behavioural therapy. I want a wider rage of opinions, considering I’ve been feeling quite down and desperate lately. I just want to find the best option asap. I’d appreciate any opinions!",03Apr2019,1
33,"I don't know much about mental health, aside from the more commonly taught issues such as clinical depression and anxiety disorders, mostly because a multitude of my friends have to deal with these on a daily basis, so, I apologize if this is the wrong reddit to post on to ask questions like these, but I appreciate any help offered (I'm new to reddit, so sorry for that as well!).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having an issue with my emotions, more specifically how quick I am to flip between emotions or am provoked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some days feel like everything is crushing me inside, a day like this being where after I lashed out at someone and I cried a multitude of times (at separate intervals throughout the day), finding it hard to breathe with how shaken I was. To my recollection, there wasn't anything too stressful going on around me to have caused this kind of reaction. Yes, my relationship with this person I snapped at isn't the best, in fact I'd say its the closest I've gotten to 'hating' someone in a while, but I deal with them on a daily basis (with grit teeth) so this should have really been another average day. 

&amp;#x200B;

And after that day, it was fairly average, except for the dizzy and hazy feeling I continued to have, everything feeling like too much or too little all at once. I continue to have hazy days like this now, even weeks after this one incident. This isn't the only time this has occurred, feeling dizzy, but its a lot more frequent now as of ever.

&amp;#x200B;

I cry easily, but I also get angry easily.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not have an anger management problem, at least from my knowledge, but I am very quick to anger when provoked. When my friends tease me, I tease back, but there are instances where my anger has overcome me and made me sick. One day, a very close friend of mine was crying, curled up in a ball thanks to her best friend for reasons I think are too personal to name, but this friend of her's came by and proceeded to act friendly towards the group (my friend included). Instantly, and I feel kind of scared by this now, I lashed out, biting back and shoving the 'ex-friend' back and telling them to, as I so eloquently said, 'fuck off'. That would have been the end of it, but they provoked further by insulting me to my face, and I in another irrational fit of anger had to be held back by the acquaintance of mine I had been recently introduced to.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it normal to have such flips in emotions? From calm to irrational anger in seconds? To quiet to bawling my eyes out because I got told off by two people for being rude? I feel as if I'm unstable in the sense that I could break down any second, like a big ball of emotions and tension ready to burst. 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any help this subreddit is willing to offer, thanks and best wishes!",03Apr2019,2

35,"My little brother has struggled with his mental health his whole life. These last few years he just gets more and more depressed it seems. He started seeing a therapist, taking meds and we thought he was getting better. 

My dad has been keeping an eye on him, making sure he's okay. Tonight he said something wasn't right and took him to the hospital to be admitted. He was right, my brother had posted about ending it all tonight on his social media. He's been admitted and will be under watch for 4 days. 

I'm terrified. He's my lil brother, love him to death. Wish I saw what was going on. So much has been going on these last few months and I'm not doing so well. Terrified for the future, thinking of ways to make things better. What I could have done to fix this or at least help in some way. 


I'm so scared, but I can't think. Mind is racing. Can't stop crying, I should have showed him I cared more. I think school might be a big part in his depression. He hates it, but won't say it. He likes his friend, but I think he's being harassed. I'm worried. I should have done more. I need to do more before it's too late.

The scariest thing I've ever seen is my father, a very stoic person, break down and cry his eyes out. We're all trying so hard, but he won't talk to us. 

I'm not very religious, but I'm praying for help, for something. Anything. ",03Apr2019,3
36,"I won't be talking about the details.  It's about me a my friend who lives in a different country. A friend of 9  years.

To  put it short: A conflict started between me and my friend. Me as me,  emotional and pushy has ruined everything. But I have really fixed many  mistakes. Not all of them obviously. I convinced myself that I was so  horrible that this time he really wanted me to be gone. But I didn't  want to leave if I wasn't sure about it. Some reason in my insanity?

After  pissing him off many times with trying to talk in order to find an  honest answer if he wants me to disappear from his life I finally got  the answer.

I find it surprising but seems that he really wants me to stay. Although it constantly feels as If he was disgusted with me.

But  I will keep working on myself. Don't think I'll ever get appreaciated. I  don't wanna be that ""her"" who has done so many bad things. But let's  forget that right now.

My friend won't talk to me and I won't be trying to talk to him. He needs to be sure himself that I've stopped acting bad.

I'm  extremely stressful over this situation with him. I've made an actual  progress with not being pushy and emotional. I am not saying that it's  all perfect but I can see the progress. Lately I left the discord server  for almost 2 weeks to force myself to not to try and talk to him. To  give him space. I honestly don't understand the ""concept"" of space well.  Maybe I will one day. I take it very personal. It makes me question  myself if it's still friendship. It makes me feel like I'm trying hard  for someone for whom I'm a meaningless shit. Maybe I'm just getting it  wrong. And each time I was trying to find out if I am indeed a  meaningless shit to him I was pissing him off with being pushy. But  yeah, I think that I can really shut up and not bother him now.

**What I do not know is how to stop being so stressed over this situation with him?**  Which is probably one of the reasons why I've been having so many  troubles with being pushy. I don't mean it as an excuse but as a  ""visible"" example of how it stresses me.

And,  ah the server. During our conflict someone was added to the server. I  must admit that I disliked her right from the start. I don't know if  it's because of the conflict and my state then or just simple dislike.  Anyway, I'm jealous of his friendship with her. I don't mind him having  friends but I feel replaced. I feel left out on this server. Maybe I'm  just crazy or maybe I wouldn't feel so replaced if he wasn't treating me  like a ghost and if I wasn't so stressed. I am not saying that it's his  fault but I am very sensitive and stressed. I don't know.

**How do I deal with this jealousy?** I can act civil but it doesn't stop me from feeling it.",03Apr2019,1

38,"In 2016 I was dating this guy who was a huge jerk. He was very emotionally and verbally abusive to me. One day I was sitting in the parking lot of Walmart very distressed. My home life was awful, and I was going through a very tough time. I was on Celexa daily and Xanax as needed for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I was in the driver's seat hysterical when I called my boyfriend to tell him I felt like committing suicide. I had taken out mt bottle of Xanax and put almost all of the pills in my hand and was about to swallow them. I told him this and that I wanted to kill myself. He told me ""Go ahead and do it"". He did not care at all, and I almost did it. Yet something pulled me back and I didn't. Even though this happened almost 3 years ago it still haunts me.

I am glad to still be alive today, but that memory always shakes me up.",03Apr2019,15
39,"I don’t know why, but there’s a lot of explanation here. 
 
My father and mother, in short terms, despise eachother. 
 
There is no love sometimes, they cannot stand eachother and will break out into these screaming, throwing things at eachother, fights, since my father doesn’t do that around me often I have to stop things before they get too rough. 
 
Mostly when they’re drunk. 
 
Anyways. 
 
These happen every two weeks or so- and I’ve become so conditioned to them. 
 
I guess the calm-ness in these situations begun in a very scary argument that fucked me up for weeks was a few months ago back in early winter, my father and mother had an anniversary date thingy and they came back ~4 am drunk as shit, and were yelling at eachother to hell and back. 
 
My dad had thrown something at my mom, who, was visibly upset over it. 
 
I was the only one awake because I’m used to staying up late in case I have to intervene, whatever. Useless information. 
 
I went downstairs, blanket wrapped around my arms because i’d just SH, it was getting really bad, they were yelling at eachother nonsense that I cannot remember at all because it’s all a blur. 
 
When I went down there my dad was SCREAMING, like prepubescent teenage voice crack inducing screaming, basically. 
 
When I saw that- it messed me up. A lot. Because you can tell he wasnt- er, mentally right, I remember specifically him saying ‘ SHE’S DRIVING ME INSANE, ( My name ) GET THIS WOMAN AWAY FROM ME! ‘ in that tone- it scared me. A lot. 
 
( The rest of the week I had that memory over and over in my head ) after the fight sizzled down that day, I went to my bed and laughed. 
 
Yes, laughed. Hysterically, hand in hair, crying, etc. 
 
I cut, a lot. 
 
I don’t know why I did it- it was almost like I released all the emotion I’d felt from the fight that I’d been suppressing. It’s weird- I’m sorry. I can’t explain it. 
 
But it all exploded out of me that night and that was the closest I’ve ever come to suicide. 
 
Nobody came to check on me. 
 
Flash forward to two weeks before today, a big enough fight the police were alerted from the neighbors. 
 
My dad was insulting my (very suicidal) Step-sister, exactly how he used to insult me, sickening words that I can’t think about without struggling on my breath. 
 
I couldn’t listen to him say that about her, she was crying in her pillows as I sat in her room because I didn’t want her to do anything to herself. 
 
Anyways, I knew it wouldn’t stop if I didn’t do something- I have to. * it’s what I have to do. If I don’t they will KILL eachother. I know it. * 
 
So I talked. I spoke in a confident voice, shaky, sure, but it was strong and I spoke over him. Calmly. 
 
Mentally? I was PANICKING. I didn’t want to say something wrong because *what if he hit me? what if he hit my sister? my mom? what if I make it WORSE?*
 
But physically, I was speaking to him with the confidence of a spokesperson. I don’t know how, I did this before, too, in another fight where he made my mom bleed. 
 
After the police came, it all broke down, I had a very silent mental breakdown as the police spoke to us, I wanted to cut but- there were police. So.,,, but still, I don’t know HOW I spoke with such confidence. 
 
Anyways. Enough story-time. 
  
I know I’m not getting less afraid of him, I’m always so afraid because he’s very capable of destroying us. I can’t do things in my house in fear of his fucking wrath. I can’t go outside, I can’t even date ( I’m a freshman in high school) because he scares me. I can’t open our over bad self esteem because he will know. 
 
I don’t like him. 
 
I’m afraid of him. 
 
But I feel in power during the arguments. Like I’ve killed a ninety nine babies and he’s my hundredth, ( What a brutal metaphor. ) and I don’t know why or how. 
 
Does anyone know what this is called? I googled it and it just came up with life or death situations. Aaa. 
 
Any help would be appreciated.,,

40,"April 2011 I was raped, and April last year I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, mania, and delusions. Upon reflection, other years have been difficult as well. I hadn’t put the two together until a close friend I’ve confided in pointed it out. 

I have worked so hard for the last year to address my mental health: counseling, medication, journaling, exercise, yoga, healthier diet kinda, maintaining positive influences in my life, communicating how I’m feeling with those who I’m really close with, I’m in a good relationship, etc. 

And maybe it’s just knowing that I’m coming up on a year, or maybe it’s some weird coincidence, or maybe it’s an actual annual cycle, but I feel like shit. I feel like a shell and I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore. And then I realized it’s April and now I feel ever shittier about myself.

I’m wavering between bouts of severe anxiety and apathy/depression. I’m having trouble sleeping again. I just cried for the first time in a long time. I’m lonely. I’m having horrible nightmares again. 

Luckily, no suicidal ideation or anything like that, but it feels like I’m standing on a fucking grenade. I’m about to lose my health insurance and I have one more appointment with my counselor before that happens.

47,"My name is Gracie. I’m 17, and I live in California. Sounds amazing right? I should almost be done with high school, I can go to the beach whenever and I can be an actress if all I do is sit pretty and photoshop myself. 

I live in the capital of California. To people who are not good with geography, it’s not Los Angeles. It’s over 300 miles away. Here life is pretty boring, and everyone in my age group is horrible. 

I’ve been bullied my entire life. Starting from kindergarten because my mom was the yard duty at my elementary, and the sixth graders hated her. I was bullied by people twice my age. My parents split up, and my dad became verbally abusive towards me. He once told me, “i will rip off your head and shit down your neck,” because I wanted to stay with my mom for one weekend. I was diagnosed with depression at 7. Anxiety at only 6 years old. 

Middle school was the worst of the bullying though. I had partially dyed hair, ugly, gapped &amp;  bucked teeth, and i didn’t quite understand that your eyebrows are supposed to be close to the same color as your hair. Girls were jealous of me because my mom allowed me to get my nails done and dye my hair any color, within reason. They were mad that I was so easily friends with all the boys(im a lesbian, i like talking about girls and vaginas, of course i get along better with the guys) I was always called a “slut” or “whore” for wearing shorts to school, but i looked cute and they werent even that short. The worst thing that happened to me in 7th grade was when my english/history teacher called me infront of the entire class and made me a demonstration of what shorts not to wear. The rule was fingertip length or longer. My shorts were at my nail tips. I cried for hours and the principal refuses to suspend the teacher because “nobody else complained.” 

8th grade was when i came back to school and had the largest breasts anyone in my age group had seen. I was accused of plastic surgery. I was 11. That year was such a hard year. 

Fast forward to the present. I’m finished with high school early. I was bullied so relentlessly the first two years if high school I was forced out of the school by the administration of the school district. But hey, look at that, im done already. I finished in December 2018. I got my license January 2019, i had my first real girlfriend from December 2018-Today(april 2,19) 

Two weeks and two days ago I was released from the hospital after being on a 5150 hold for 6 days. For anyone who doesnt know what a 5150 is, its an involuntary 72 hold for someone who is at risk of harm to themselves or others. I asked my mom to commit me because i woke up to a suicide note on my bed and my anxiety pill bottles next to me. 

I was held for 5 days, because the first two i did not seem to have much change. The day i was committed, i was in a crisis unit, not my actual hospital where i was treated. I was in the real hospital for 5 days, the crisis unit for a full 24 hours. I was driven to the hospital in an ambulance, and was the center of attention when i got there. I hated it. I was scared. I wanted my mom. The hospital i was taken to was 2 and 1/2 hours from where i live, where my mom was. I felt alone. 

I was officially checked in. 

I was released, so happy and fresh. Group therapy and my new medicine were so good to my brain. But then i lost it once i got home. 

This is just a vent. Please don’t go to the hospital unless it’s 100% necessary. Its a scary, scary place. You have everything stripped from you. Your privacy, most of your clothing. Its all confiscated. The nurses are always loud at night, and their lights are so bright, so when then come into the room to check on you, you’re woken up and then cant fall back asleep because theyre yelling and having the time of their lives. 

Im 17 years old. I tried to end my life. I went to the hospital. I was helped, but scarred for life. ",03Apr2019,18
48,"This post is half venting and half trying to move on. I've spent probably the past 6-7 years doing nothing. More so the past maybe 4-5. I have literally just been doing nothing and been interested in nothing. I hate it and i genuinely don't know how to move on. I feel very incapable and incompetent at things and worry about my future once my parents can no longer take care of me(I'm currently 21). I also feel pretty bad about the burden I put on them. I don't really have the social skills or any skills really to be able to work and survive in the real world. I do however find myself somewhat interested in coding. I have briefly looked into it and took a uni class(Computer Science 1) on it and it seems like something i could maybe do. The class I took was on java so I know just the very basics of that but I am going to start learning python or C.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this post is I am wondering if anyone would be interested in learning coding as well. It would be good for me and give me more motivation to do something that could potentially be a hobby but also a skill for a job. But I think this also might be good for anyone else who is like me and just doing nothing all day everyday and wasting away just feeling depressed.

52,"I don’t really talk about it. I never really talked about it in therapy.

I was adopted when I was 15 years old. I was the 3rd oldest of 5 kids. My mother had a problem with narcotics, I had found out when I was 13 and it made me angry. Most of the time we didn’t have a place to live. We would stay in homeless shelters or hotels. We would move often and I still don’t know why. Because we moved so often I never really went to school. I got 4 years of school altogether. I got angry because I realized why we never had a place to live was because my mother would use her SSI to buy pills. She was always like so zoned out and just didn’t care about anything. She was there but not really ya know? Her physical presence was there but she wasn’t. Ever since I had discovered she had a problem with pills I had started to hate her. One day I was angry at her for some reason. So I decided “I’m going to commit suicide and she’ll miss me then” so I drank laundry soap. Obviously it didn’t work for 2 reasons 1) that was a very half assed suicide attempt and looking back I realized it was for attention 2) laundry soap is not going to kill you. It’s gonna make you a little sick but that’s it. 
But I drank laundry soap and everybody panicked so I was taken to the hospital. I was evaluated by a psychiatrist and put into a behavioral health hospital. Behavorial health hospitals aren’t that bad they are better than a homeless shelter for sure. So I kept doing fake suicide attempts trying to get put back in. I liked the attention and it was away from my mother who I hated so much. About the 3rd one I went into I started talking about my home life. That’s when my psychiatrists at the hospital started calling DCFS. DCFS would dismiss the cases even though we would be living in a room with multiple other families sleeping on cots and we couldn’t shower more than twice a week. But I was persistent. I kept going to behavorial health hospitals and telling the doctors everything and each time they would call DCFS. I kept going into psychiatric hospitals because I didn’t have a phone and neither did my mother so I would say I was suicidal to someone in charge at the shelters and go to the hospital and get admitted. But anyway my mother knew exactly where the reports were coming from. I was trying to get her to get help. I wanted my mother back. I wanted to be able to go to school. Since she knew I was the one reporting her she asked a family friend to take me. We called him Uncle even though he wasn’t blood family. He was a very hyper gay man. Him and his husband agreed to take me. They saw me as the black sheep of the family. I moved in with them and July 2015 I was adopted by my new dads. They gave me everything I wanted. I was now living in a upper middle class neighborhood. But I wanted my family. It hurt that I was the only one who got adopted. But those men saved my life and I wouldn’t be who I am today if it wasn’t for my two wonderful dads. They immediately put me into intensive therapy that I continued for 3 years. I saw a therapist 4 days a week including group therapy. It helped get me better but I’ve never gotten over the feeling of abandonment knowing I was the only one out of 5 children to get adopted. I know I was a little shit but I wanted my mom.It’s been 4 years since I was adopted but I can’t get over the anger and the hurt. I know that my story has painted me in a bad light and that’s fine. I just wanted to get this off my chest. ",03Apr2019,12

I didn’t want to eat anything else, I just wanted the raw meat. I stood in the living room for a few minutes contemplating if I should go to the kitchen for more or if I should go back upstairs.

Okay so my sister (S) used to date her trans female roommate (R) and recently things have gone crazy. R is always very emotionally controlling and essentially has S in an emotional cage. I got a message off S that R had broke S’s bedroom door after going ballistic out of what was literally a regular conversation. R needs to go. The thing is that R has had MANY mental health issues including depression and another array of things I can’t fully understand. R has spoken about plans to commit suicide and said that one of her personalities wants to kill R. S doesn’t want to kick R out because she could go completely mental, potentially hurting S or killing herself. What can S do in this situation so that nobody gets hurt (or that damage is minimal)?

56,"I started Prozac today. Took my first half tablet as instructed by my GP. I was really proud of myself. I’ve been depressed for around 4-5 years, and I always felt helpless as a different GP tried to put me on sleeping plans and didn’t really ever want to discuss my referral regarding antidepressants. I was told the first week is tough. Since I just turned 16, and therefore under 25 - I might experience more intensified suicidal thoughts.

For around 6-7 hours straight, I was OUT of it. Completely dazing out. Tuning out of conversations. Blurry, foggy mind. Heavy head and eyelids. My brain couldn’t keep up with the usually mentally stimulating conversations I have daily, and I found myself fading and foggy whenever I stumbled on my words. I couldn’t attend the entirity of 4 classes because of this.

I also had a little bit of anxiety (not uncommon) paired with my eyes burning with tears randomly, and intense fatigue. After a 30 minute nap I was extremely, extremely energetic for the rest of the day.

Are these side effects normal? Should I be concerned? Am I overthinking? I plan to keep continuing the Prozac, but I can’t find anything online relating to these things I experienced. ",03Apr2019,1
57,"Okay so about 3 weeks ago, I stand up out of bed to go to the bathroom. About 3 seconds after getting up, I can't move my body anymore. I sway around like a tree in a thunderstorm and everything I hear is run through this distant distorted loop, not unlike after inhaling laughing gas (nitrous oxide). Now, it scared the shit out of me, but I didn't think too much of it. 

Last night as I was in bed, this happened to me multiple times as I was lying down, not after any movement whatsoever. I felt my body become very heavy and immobilised, the sound loop happened again and I got CEV's. This time distinct auditory hallucinations accompanied the event. I heard two people talking on my couch, what they were saying I am not sure. Then I heard a man's laugh... VERY distinct. I feeling of helplessness and terror is very apparent, but the last time it happened I just observed as it took me over, this was when I hear the laugh. One time I felt also like a couldn't breath. I have also felt even during the day recently, as if there is a beast behind me sometimes, about to attack. 

My concern is that I have been taking a lot of drugs recently, namely clanozolam (the RC benzo, not Klonopin) and I am wondering if this has catalysed or precipitated these events. I also took MDMA this weekend. I have a strong history of substance abuse and mental illness in my family.

She has Depression, Schizophrenia, Bipolar II, PTSD, Multipersonality and Cotard syndrome. This is accompanied with certain heart problems. I am someone who is planning to take psychology, and I have been very patient with her. There were times where she has perturbed me, once from trying to manipulate me that she was dead and pretending to be someone else on the phone. She has tried to stab her doctors before due to her temper, and has cut herself in the past. She wonders how I'm still able to love her despite how sick she is. Sometimes, she tells me I'm the only person she holds on to. I am as committed to her back. I make sure I approach her appropriately on a given circumstance but also maintain my own welfare and health.

While I do love her dearly, I sometimes find it ironic that she sounds like a character in a book. She's gone through very horrible things I don't think I should elaborate too much in here.

I'm someone who sets ridiculous standards for himself and gets depressed when he can't meet them. Best grades in school, difficult engineering degree and so forth.

But there is a route to a 2:1 that I can - and many people in my life think I should - take. All it means is redoing some exams in the summer, as I wasn't very well during exams (depressed/anxious) and can get the marks discounted.

This morning my partner woke me up by kissing me goodbye on his way out.  When I opened my eyes it wasn't him though.  I was very much awake and very clearly seeing my ex husband, who I divorced because of his severe alcoholism.  I stared into his face for what felt like thirty long seconds but his face didn't change.  He was smiling and it was unmistakably him.
Then I felt my alarm go off and reached over to shut it off.  When I looked back at him he was my partner again.  It was early morning grey in our bedroom but I didn't think it was a light trick.  It was very clear.
The whole thing has me a little freaked out, honestly. I've never had an experience where I so clearly saw something that wasn't real.  There was a lot of emotional trauma from this marriage and I don't think of my ex husband fondly so why was he smiling?  Why think of him at all?  Why SEE him like he was actually standing there?

I’ll start with them first, they hate. I don’t know why or what I have done but the just hate me. Always angry at me, none of them ever say anything nice to me. 

I’m the only boy and middle child, maybe that has something to do with it. But nothing I do pleases them. I spend an hour sweeping the floor and mopping it? My mum comes home and yells at me and calls me a retard saying I haven’t done it right. She isn’t an alcoholic or drug user. My little sister always has bad things to say about me, she will get home call me a dick head or something like that. My older sister is probably the better of the 3. But still always grouchy, and we live with her boyfriend. They make the house a mess which I try to clean but just get yelled at for it. 

A few months ago my mum was at the shops with my little sister and she impulsively bought this puppy (which we couldn’t afford, she had to north money from my Grandma). She didn’t consult me or my big sister about it whatever, and now this silly little dog reminds me of how much my mum doesn’t care about me. A dog should make someone happy not sad. Anyway the next day my big sister and her boyfriend brought home a kitten. This worst part about all this is that our cat (which was pretty much mine since I cared for it the most) had ran away about 2 weeks prior. They completely forgot about my little cat that I loved so much and replaced him with this other two animals. This upset me beyond belief. 

I’ve dropped a very important school class because my mum told me I would never be able to do it because I am to stupid, my sisters get all the encouragement about everything. She has even taken my money to buy my sister video games before.

Now onto my girlfriend, which I love. But she is a bitch. She is very mean and rude. A stuck up brat. But she is my only escape from my family. I can go to hers or go out with her and I’m not at my shitty home. But she is stressful and really she really just takes a toll on me.

72," Right now, I am relying on the kindness of strangers to help me out. If you read through all this, you are a champ. 

My husband (35) and I (30) hit a rocky point in our marriage of 5 years, (we’ve been together for a total around 10). We started drifting apart probably around 6 years ago, I couldn’t tell you what caused us to start drifting, but we did.  Around this time I started solo counseling to help with my depression, anxiety and addictions to the internet. I mentioned to my therapist that I felt the drift and she recommended couples counselling, but my husband said it would work out… Clearly it didn't. 

A  year a go, due to an “event” in our circle of friends, my husband developed a severe social anxiety and paranoia. To the point where he started to develop theories that people that we knew would turn on him at any moment and “feed him to the wolves” so to speak if he did or said anything off color or wrong to upset them. I tried to swade him otherwise. But he refused to go out with me and it started to weight on me, even though I tried to play it tough, it made me really sad to see him like this and he refused to get counseling of his own. 

I continued to see friends and people we knew… I missed the man I knew. I didn't know how to help him. 

I missed being intimate. I missed being near someone. The communication in our relationship crumbled around 5 years ago. Partly my fault, or mostly my fault for being consumed in my phone all of the time. I am not sure. But there were times I recalled where I was shut up, not in a mean or vindictive way, but in a “oh, here goes Summer, talking about this thing again”... So I just stopped talking and let him take control of the conversation. I think this bothered him. But, I was always a little afraid I was going to say the wrong thing and he would just talk over me. I began to not pay attention, because I think subconsciously, it was me talking over him for once.

Our sex died down a bit as well, turning thirty did nothing for my libido. But he took it as “you don't find me attractive any more” and so sex became like a chore and we would fight about it. Till he said “fine, you can initiate sex”... So I have been. Up till a month or so ago, he told me he was tracking how often we would have sex “the national average, which is good”. When I told him that this kind of hurt my feelings, he stopped, but I still can't shake that he's tracking my performance as a wife in many other places.  He’s said on a few occasions that he’s felt that he’s only a pet for me, that I only keep him around to help pay the bills… 

Fast forward to last month. 

I began a conversation with a mutual acquaintance and we really hit it off. We both exchanged numbers and went on our way. We both have anxiety and depression and discussed ways that we cope with it. We began talking about other mutual interests and realized we had a mutual attraction to one another.  I thought to myself in an inner monologue maybe I could open up my marriage and date this person on the side. But, I made it clear to this other person… I am in a committed monogamous relationship, we can be friends and that’s it. 

Throughout my marriage, my husband knew I was bisexual (perhaps even Pansexual) but never had a girlfriend or really a relationship with a woman. I also thought that I could be polyamorous because of how openly and fiercely I loved other people. But we established in the beginning that monogamy was our jam because of the aspect of Jealousy. After the last few months, I figured it was time for a change. 

I asked my husband if he would be open to a poly relationship. I did not bring up the other person yet. He immediately shut down… Everything hit the fan. He thought this was the beginning of the end. I mentioned that we were drifting apart and I thought that since he didn’t seem to want to fix it and I couldn’t change it, maybe this could be a solution for us. I admit that I went about it all wrong. He thought that this was my way of reaching for the door… It wasn’t. 

He thought it over the next few days, and he said he would be open to me dating only women, although I agreed, the other person was a male, and I admitted that I had another person in mind, and laid all those cards on the table. Again, he reacted with frustration and anger. Again, I went about it in all the wrong ways. He said that I could no longer look at this person in public again, I could not message him and recently he asked that I not interact with him on Facebook. That I had emotionally cheated on him. I had betrayed his trust. He said I may remain friends with this person, but ask that I reach out to this other person and tell him to ignore me completely till we fix our marriage.  I know that this is his insecurities talking and not him trying to be controlling... It is very stifling, but I am honoring his request.

My husband since this time has been, over compensating for everything… Taking me out on dates. Reaching out to friends again. Which are all great, but I feel like he is doing it all for the wrong reasons. I feel like he is doing it to keep me around, not to keep himself sane.  

I want to help him. I want to love him. But everyday is getting more and more challenging. And although, in the beginning of this cataclysmic event, I was not looking for the door… Maybe now I am… What is wrong with me. Am I an awful person. How could I do this to a person I love and who loves me so fiercely?  I am starting to fall out of love and I feel awful. 

If I did leave, I would just want to be alone for a good long while and discover who I am and not actually be with anyone. 

I have done everything I can… I am losing sleep. My performance at work is tanking. I am retreating into a severe depression. I am thinking of driving my car off a cliff every time I drive to work… I am still going to therapy… I am going to mention all this to my therapist.  I have mentioned everything of this to my therapist to this point 

We are seeing a couples therapist. We are on session 2. The couples therapist is 6 years in his practice, so he is still very new at providing treatment to couples… At this point. Is our marriage salvageable?   I keep telling myself, give it at least 6 months.. But what if I don’t last 6 months?  ",03Apr2019,1

75,"So hello! As my title says I need a little help. Anyway I guess I'll start with some background info. I grew up in an abusive household and have some depression and anxiety stemming from that. Recently I moved out with my boyfriend, we have always had a little bit  of problems so it was probably dumb of me to do, but I made the decision and now I've got to deal with it. Anyway we have been fighting  a decent amount and I'm pretty much done.  I've decided the only way we can stay together is if we both get mental help or something of the sort. I know what I need to do because I've been dealing with this crap forever, but I don't know what my boyfriend should do, he has a totally different problem. He grew up in a wealthy family so is a bit spoiled and has a mean father that blew up at everyone about everything and he's got a bit of that in him. I cant tell if it's just a product of being a wealthy only child or if it's a mental issue that needs to be delt with. Half of the time he is wonderful, but then he is totally different. He seems to have a superiority complex and really bad anger issues. It seems like he switches really fast from normal to angry about really dumb stuff. And it's like really angry, like I can't talk to him he is convinced that nobody listens and everybody gives him attitude and treats him like crap, but I'm just trying to talk. And his anger sets of my anxiety so I start hyperventilating and freaking out and it just makes things worse. Anyway my question is what should he go do/who should he see? I know you guys don't know everything about what's going on but I just don't know where to start. If he should go to anger management, or counseling, or just take a class on how to communicate without being basically a bully. I've never delt with anger and superiority issues before and just don't know who to tell him to go see. I dont want anyone to think this is just me shitting on my partner, I love him and I recognize I play a part and have issues myself, I just don't know what to tell him he should do. If he shows no interest in making an effort I'll move on because it can go on like this, and if he does then great. I know it wont be quick but its better than letting it go unchecked. Thanks, also I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is wack.

Anyway on Monday night I received a phone call off my dad saying that our other dog Kaiser is going to be put to sleep. I live 3 and a half hours away so woke up early Tuesday morning and drove home to see Kaiser and say my good byes. It was awful. I just drove back to my flat (probs not the best idea cos of my frame of mind atm) because of work commitments and I cried the whole journey. To make it worse a pheasant jumped into the road and I hit my breaks but ended up killing it. I feel like the worst person in the world.

The guy has been through a tough year where he nearly died of an infection, and has been depressed for a long time. However I never knew things were this bad, and though we always used to talk, lately he's been glossing over things.

Anyway, according to his wife, he's been addicted to booze and downers for a while now, and has been hiding that from everybody too. At the weekend, he went out to sea, drank a shitload of alcohol, and waiting for the tide to come in and carry him away. But he was rescued and brought back.

I thought maybe this would be the turning point. He's been refused mental health help because of his drug and alcohol addiction, but has now been accepted for detox and rehab. But I've had little contact from him since apart from a couple of messages. I've let him know that I care and that I and all his friends are here for him, but he's not answering phone calls.

Anyway, today I hear from his wife that he's taking 10x as much Valium as before, and redoubled his drinking, and is sure to kill himself. Not only that, but he's taken her car and driven it around after 2x bottles of wine and a handful of pills.

Unfortunately I'm at the other side of the country and can't directly intervene, but I'm shit scared that he's not going to make it as far as rehab, and with his drunk driving etc. may end up hurting somebody else too.

91,"Hi,

I'm an 18 year old male who has never really struggled with mental health before, except bad hypochondria (health anxiety); but recently have been having real issues in that I have an awful fear that certain intrusive thoughts i have, and some feelings I get are symptoms of a personality disorder. I've never really thought about them before, but now i have, i'm terrified i do have a personality disorder. Some thoughts/feelings i have that worry me are as follows; 

1) Although this has improved in the last year, i sometimes have intrusive thoughts like ""I would get so much attention if I were hospitalised, or x happened, or y event occurred and i was involved."" - i get these semi-regularly, normally when someone i care about isn't giving me much attention and they usually do. It is worth noting i don't want to be hospitalised, or involved in a bad event, and would never purposely try to get these events to happen to me for attention, i don't have urges to and i don't want to - but the intrusive thought about how much attention i would get is there. This has gotten a lot better over recent months, while before i thought nothing of them, now the more i think about it the more i hate myself for it, i don't want to have these thoughts, and hate myself when they come into my brain.

2) Sometimes i have irrational feelings, for example i get jealous when my girlfriend makes new friends or talks to other people, male or female; i think the foundation of this, is again, the attention issue - i get melancholic because the attention isn't on me, in the past, this is often when thought number one above would pop up into my brain, but i would never attempt to do things like that to get me attention, and i would never bring it up to my partner. 

3) It is worth mentioning i am not suicidal, or depressed; i don't have urges to self harm or hurt myself for attention and i recognise that doing so is extremely manipulative - but i'm scared these thoughts i have are a lesser version of a personality disorder like borderline, or if i'm just being freaked out for no reason. 

4) I used to constantly require reassurance of my ex; i would want her to tell me she loves me a lot, and i would want her to reassure me i was attractive - i was only 16 at the time of this relationship, and i've grown out of this and don't do this in my current relationship. i look back and i'm ashamed of this, but i have since matured and gotten more self-confident and don't need constant reassurance from my current partner.

 These thoughts/feelings used to be more amplified when i was in my first relationship, i was in-love and felt a lot of emotions i never really had felt before, and as a result, these things were worse than they are now, in my second relationship, with a girl i also love. I like to think i have matured a little bit and these things have gotten better, but i still sometimes have these thoughts, that, before a couple of weeks ago, i never thought anything of. I don't know if this desire for attention is a personal disorder, or if it's just emotional immaturity. I really would appreciate some help, as i've been really concerned about this lately.

92,"so i've been struggling for a while now. I think i'm bipolar, and now that i don't live at home anymore it's starting to show. I moved out of my parent's house about 7 months ago for college. Now there's nobody that checks what time i go to bed or get up (or anything else i do).

There's a clear pattern of me just not having energy at all for like a week, then i eat like shit and barely do anything. But then all of a sudden i have a week where i work 15 hours a day and have hella energy to cook and work out.

I want to go to a psychologist for this, however my parents still take care of my insurance, and i would prefer if they wouldn't find out about this, because they will be worried sick, whereas i think it would be better if i get some clarity first.

“So basically sometimes i have these random nervous attacks that take away all my happiness and replace it with hate for you, dad, mom, my friends, anyone i know and myself. It makes me do really stupid things. Such as cutting my hair but before i did that i pretended to be a boy because my head kept telling me it was easier to be a boy! So i made my hair look like a guys hair. It wasn’t even so i cut it even. When i put my hair down again i realized i had cut my tiny bangs but not all of it. The next day i had a massive break down while dad was sleeping. I cried in the bathroom so much. I think dad woke up by it. Then i had horrible thoughts about how hard my life is and how no one loves me which i know is not true but when I’m in the middle of an attack i will believe anything my brain tells me! In that state i will remember all the bad things I’ve die. All the mean things people have said to me and i tell myself I’m worthless that i don’t deserve anything that i have. You may think I’m making this up but I’m not. I look happy all the time but in reality I’m a wreck and i cover it up with good grades and hobbies. Lately I’ve been having more serious attacks and it has affected my work ethic. I procrastinate a little now and         I have gotten 2 MEs this quarters on assignments! I’ve never gotten an ME in homeroom this entire year!!! Every time i get anything other than EE in my homeroom i have a mild attack but later at home i get a major one. I cry a lot. When we are talking  and i get all crazy it’s because i snap but i still don’t want to expose it to you. No one but you knows this. Sometimes i scratch myself kick myself bite myself rub my body into something hard or as i did just now cut my hair. I know it sounds dumb and hilarious by to me it feels like a vicious circle! I feel bad once then i get an attack it makes me do something stupid after t ends i regret it and i feel bad and repeat. The first time i had an attack was in third grade when my teacher said i didn’t do my raz kids when i did and i thought i was wrong and i finally got over it a week later since it was my first time dealing with a nervous breakdown/ attack. I don’t know what h was thinking when i cut my hair but that’s the thing after my attacks i forget everything except that i did have one. So that is the full explanation. You wanted it you got it. I’ve been trying to cope with it by meditating and writing in my diary it is helping but it only decreases the seriousness of the attacks hopefully i will grow out of it. Please don’t tell ANYBODY!

97,"4 days ago I got out of a mental hospital for attempted suicide, hallucinations, anxiety and a little bit of depression at least that's what my doctor told me but they didn't know the truth so that's not exactly correct. I still do plan on killing myself not because I am sad or feel stuck but because it is the ultimate release and I can finally be with them forever, the doctors tried to get rid of my voices but they are the only things that make me feel safe and sane. They are even nicer to me now and no longer hurt my head and they told me exactly what will happen when I die and I can't wait. Well anyways while at the hospital I stopped eating that much as I was no longer hungry, the staff threatened to give me an IV if my vitals dropped so I would eat just enough so that wouldn't happen or at least be too obvious if it did happen, I then started binge eating and throwing up, I would eat a lot of food until I felt sick then use my toothbrush to throw it all up. When ever I eat food I feel angry and disgusted with my self but they told me all I have to do is throw it up and I will feel much better so now I do and it does feel better. I was in the hospital for 10 days but finally got them to release me after convincing them and lying saying I wouldn't kill myself. I don't take my medication because it's actually poison and the doctors are trying to kill the vocies, the doctors are mad the voices warn me of danger and don't trust the doctors so they want to kill them so they can no longer tell me the truth but I won't let them.

Or when I'm frustrated with my friend, I'll zone out when I'm alone and think about a conversation with them on how to fix what's wrong. Usually those conversations don't end up sunshine and rainbows but with us losing our friendship.
Both of these scenarios end up making me feel more sad/alienated and upset, respectively.

102,"27, male, UK. So after years of trying to cope on my own with my social anxiety and possible depression, I admitted to my work colleagues, friends and GF that I need help. I've cancelled 2 doctors appointments in the past year because I felt better after the long wait and thought they would just go ""aah your ok, be on your way."" and told myself that this was the right choice to make also. 

I play guitar but have never been in a band, the more recent panic attack I think stemmed from a drummer that I jammed with recently when the stage fright got the better of me and I forgot everything I knew (he however was totally fine with it and has problems like mine if not worse.) This was 2 weeks ago, and I have gotten more irritated with everything and everyone around to the point where I hated it all. The inferiority I felt from the jam I had stuck with me and followed me to work. 

After I caught my manager telling the others I work with of my short comings as an employee there I hated all of them too. Although really deep down I know shes not a hateful person and I can see her frustration now I've calmed a bit.

Yesterday I broke down at work and had to tell them all this and that I think I need help. It was the scariest fucking thing I've ever done. I have a doctors appointment somewhere near the end of this month and I don't know what to expect. 

**So what happens now with the doctors, what can I expect? What do you think of this whole odd scenario?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Side note** and probably beyond the scope of this Reddit: 

My girlfriend lives 120 miles away and I travel to see her every few weekends. I've been saving money to move out (all of my cars have destroyed my savings for the last 4 years so I bought one brand new to build up to this moment) 4 years later I finally have enough to move out with and she hints that maybe I should find a different job where I am now. 

Of course I was like ""what? So I shouldn't come? / don't want me to move in with you?"" To keep this short we both want different things apparently and I'm thinking of breaking off a 6 year relationship with this lovely girl this weekend to **1)** do the right thing for her as her work is really mobile and but a far reach while she also has the idea to move to New Zealand with it, where I do not have a a qualification to my name and will not get in the country with her. and **2)** stay here where I already have friends and family and a decent paid job that I like but enjoy the life of mediocrity I already have without her. 

We will leave it on good terms, I can't see that it would be a messy break up as we have argued once in a 6 year relationship. 

Anyways, thats probably way more that I wanted to share and the GF situation is probably way past the scope of this Reddit. So, sorry but along with my issues I didn't really want this to happen also as you can imagine so I guess it's relevant as it's current?

104,"I started seeing a therapist a few months ago, bi-weekly visits, hour long sessions.  

Just somebody to talk to about the shit that is going on in my life that I don't want to talk to my mom or friends about.

All went well for the first two visits, he started doing his thing, had me writing letters, keeping a journal, talking, and it was working well I thought.  I was feeling a little better.

Then he cancelled on me the day before my third appointment, his receptionist told me it was a personal reason.  Fine.

The next visit was the same, however he ended about 10 minutes early on me and I didn't realize until I turned my phone back on and noticed the time, in my car after I left the building.  Not cool.

He cancelled my next appointment today, so out of 5 scheduled visits he has cancelled two on me, and cut one short.

I'm finding a new guy, somebody who at least can pretend they give a shit.

I randomly picked this one off my insurances website, swing and a miss if you ask me.

Are there any sites out there that can give me ratings, reviews, or just information on who I will be considering?

I'm using my health insurance website, there are a lot of doctors on there, but nothing in the way of reviews.

Plenty to choose from, all in network, I just want to know ahead of time if they will be a good fit for me.

Thank you for reading.

I've always struggled with huge mood swings and anxiety.

I also have been through the suicidal attempts in my younger years and no longer want to die at all, but God why is my body trying to kill me.  

I emailed a few psychiatrists and doctors cause my anxiety will literally not allow me to make a call, if I try my words get all flustered snd it's sometimes hard for me to speak. 

Oddly I didnt have a speech impediment before my brother had passed and he was gone very unexpected as a few others and I had plans and spoke or hung out with him hours before the tragedy.  

Another thing, I can talk about him passing but deep down I utterly do not believe hes gone.  I talk to him like hes alive in my car to stay sane missing him so much.  I still text him on snap since his # is deactivated.

I have several big presentations coming up at school and a college interview. For the last two days I’ve thrown up at least once in the toilet at school. I don’t know why but I know it is connected to my mental health. I don’t want to tell my therapist because it will make her realize how bad of a place I really am in and she may take more action.

111,"Hi nice people of r/mentalhealth \- I need some help. This is going to get a bit long and vent-y, so I apologize in advance. Throwaway account because many of my clients know my personal account.

A quick TL;DR to decide if you want to read this wall of text: my wife is pregnant and I am very concerned about her brother becoming violent against the baby, but I am at a loss for how to handle it.

A little background - my wife comes from a very successful, but also very dysfunctional family. Her father was abusive (mostly to her brother) and her mother was (is) an alcoholic. Growing up, her brother was violent with her (there were knife holes in her wall) but the parents never really did much about it. Somehow, she persevered through all of this and became a wonderful and stable woman and I am beyond proud of, and in awe of, her because of that. The rest of her family, on the otherhand, not so much.

Her father has done his best to remedy his actions with her, and while it isn't perfect and I believe he is in denial about most of it, they have developed a great relationship over the last 5 years or so. This isn't really the issue but it does have some relationship to it.

My wife and her mother have had a very hot and cold relationship over the 8 years we've been together. Her mother is a well-meaning, generous person - but she struggles mentally and is not willing to admit it. She is a very high functioning alcoholic. I believe she has a lot of guilt for not leaving her ex-husband much sooner to get her kids out of the situation they were in, but she would never admit it. Instead, she HAS to keep herself as busy as possible. She is the busiest retired person I've ever met. She gets up in the morning and works herself to the bone (mostly projects on one of her many houses) until 5pm when she can break open the wine and then kills 3-4 bottles every evening on her own. In her drunkenness she creates problems out of thin air and focuses a very unhealthy amount of energy on complaining about her ex and how terrible he is. She is now re-married to an alcoholic who has been sober for 20 some odd years (amazing achievement), and not even he is comfortable broaching this topic with her because.. she will bite off your head if you ever bring up something she doesn't want to talk about. She is already a very poor listener and only ever focused on herself, so to try to tell her that she needs to change something is like setting off a bomb. This becomes important later.

On to her brother. Her brother is 29 and he suffers major mental health issues that as far as we have been told, are undiagnosed. I am not an expert on any of this, so I would not just throw a label on him, but here are some of his characteristics: he is extremely paranoid and easily subscribes to conspiracy theories; he suffers from delusions about events that he thinks have happened, but have not; he becomes extremely obsessive over different topics, especially things that are race or political related; he threatens suicide but also says he would not do it ""because it's illegal""; he claims to hear voices and is often seen talking to himself; he has threatened violence against my in-laws and other family members of theirs multiple times; he has approached both my father in law and uncle in law with a sawed off shotgun (neither reported it); He threatens those around him with violence (like bashing your head into the driveway); he has no capacity for listening and empathizing with another person, when you speak with him, he is only thinking about what he will say next. What you say does not even seem to register; he has been ""baker acted"" many times.

The brother lives on property at my mother in laws about 400 miles from where we live. He and my wife have had a strained relationship for years. She cares for him and has compassion for his situation and tries to talk with him and help him when he is not angry or aggressive with her. This will usually go for about a month at a time and then he will snap and yell at her and call her names and then there will be a break for a while.

Through each one of his episodes, one of his main focuses is that she never get pregnant, because he does not agree with bringing a child into this world. And we both understand his viewpoint and feel that he has a right to that opinion. But he cannot understand that we also have a right to ours.

So cue my wife getting pregnant (very much on purpose) and we asked everyone in the family that has contact with him to please not share it with him. My wife also chose to not allow a relationship restart with him during this time (they hadn't spoken for 6 months to a year prior to the pregnancy) for the benefit of her own mental health and anxiety. The family all agreed not to tell him, however we both knew that this would not be forever and at some point someone would slip, so we fully expected him to eventually find out. We just wanted to delay it as long as possible for our own sanity.

So a few days ago (my wife is now 32 weeks pregnant), she got an e-mail from her brother. He had found out. The e-mail was VERY angry and was mostly insulting and demoralizing my wife as well as about 30 iterations of ""ABORT THE FETUS."" He did not make any threats, but his e-mail and general demeanor was still very unsettling and scary, especially as a soon to be new father who wants to protect both my wife and my soon to be son.

My wife approached her mom to let her know about the e-mail. She did not approach her in an upset or accusational way (we are not looking to place blame on anyone for spilling the beans to him), but more from a ""please keep an eye on this"" type of standpoint, since her mother has the most contact with him out of anyone. However, her mom flipped out and basically blamed it all on my wife for reading the e-mail at all and that she should have blocked his e-mails (I do not consider this an option, while it hurts my wife to see these e-mails, I think it's more important that we receive them so that if he were to plan/threaten some type of violence, we could have a chance to react). The conversation did not go well and now they are not talking to each other and there is no plan of action for how to handle this.

The cherry on top is that my mother in law is selling the property that the brother lives on to live in a property closer to us. Which means that she is totally uprooting him. She does not have a plan on where she is putting him or what she will do with him. He is not capable of working and does nothing but sit in his room all day and occasionally go to the store. We have made it clear to mother in law that if she moves him here, we will move away, we need the space and moved away on purpose. But this whole thing is going to rock his world and I worry about what the reprecussions of that will be. Especially since mother in law is not putting any thought into how she will do this. I think she just wants out.

So that puts me to my question - does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? I feel the need to protect my family, but I'm not excited about going out and buying weapons right before I start having a child crawling around the house. Yet we don't really have any other way to control this. Father in law is totally out of the picture with his son because of the damage he caused earlier, and it's impossible to even offer help to mother in law without starting World War 3. I think he needs professional help, but is there any way to force that on him besides the baker act? He will not do it of his own accord, and from my research, living in the US and over 18, there is no way to make him get help.

I just feel totally helpless. I want him to get help and maybe find some improvement. But more than anything, I want to be able to sleep at night knowing that my family is safe, and that my wife is not feeling tormented by her older brother. Any help/resources/advice would be incredibly welcome.

112,"So for years I had been on 10mg of lexapro and it helped my anxiety tons but absolutely killed my sex drive. I complained about that to my dr, tried to switch to Wellbutrin, same mg, and only lasted a week before going back to 10mg lexapro because I couldn’t handle how bad my anxiety got during the switch. I eventually went up to 20mg lexapro as my anxiety came back way worse than it was before which I think is just from being on the same mg of lexapro for so long. I recently went back to the dr and now she has me switching to Viibryd, starting at 10mg for a week and then 20mg for a week in my sample pack. I didn’t really understand her instructions of switching so I tapered down my lexapro to 10mg for about a week and then switched immediately to the Viibryd and now I am on day four and I’m nauseous, have chills and really bad “brain zaps” especially when I’m at work or the gym. I also smoke weed and that’s always been fine with the lexapro but now I feel sick and like I can’t think straight after I smoke while taking Viibyrd. I called my dr and left a voicemail asking if this was normal (sans the weed issue) but I figured I’d try here too. I saw online that someone was told to take 10mg lexapro for a week while also taking the 10mg Viibyrd for a week and I’m wondering if that was what my dr meant for me to do, she really did not make sense when explaining it to me.

114,"Hi everyone. Not sure where else to turn.

I have a 31 year old Male partner who I’ve been with for 3 years.

He’s classified as obese medically, however he totally doesn’t believe he’s obese and constantly obsesses over being ‘as fat as possible’ When asked why he wants to be fat, he claims it’s so that he can turn the fat into muscle mass. I’ve spoken to his family, who tell me he has been claiming this for the past 10 years. Apparently when he was about 21 he got into body building and the gym, heavily, and started saying that he had to become ‘super fat’ in order to gain large amounts of muscle. I don’t know anything about muscle building, I’m pretty fat myself, but this doesn’t seem healthy or correct at all. 

This would be mostly fine if he worked out and went to the gym, but he doesn’t. Instead he just sits at home insisting he wants to be a body builder whilst cramming McDonald’s into his mouth.  He stopped going to the gym about 2 years ago.

Along with this, he obsessively weighs himself at least 6 times a day. Our scales are linked up to my iPhone and on average, he’s weighing himself 6 times a day. To check that he’s gaining enough weight. He is now over 280lbs but he doesn’t care. He walks around claiming that he’s ‘too skinny’ and he genuinely holds the belief that he’s this skinny guy that is wasting away. 

It’s gotten to the point that I now hide the weighing scales when I’m going to work. I feel like a parent.

I’ve told him he needs therapy, and that he’s actually very overweight but again, he doesn’t care. He tells me he WANTS to be overweight as he needs to build muscle.

Please help. What should I do??

For years I have been living a double life. Everyone had the view that I was a great guy to be around with. Funny, out going, intelligent, etc. And while I do feel that I have those qualities, I knew that I was putting on a show. I have lied to most of the people in my life about who I am and what I truly think about situations. I believe it was more of a defense mechanism than anything malicious. I confided finally in a friend that I thought I could trust. I was tired of feeling the way I do and thought maybe if I finally confided in someone I thought could understand I could have the courage for going to a professional. If I'm honest, the idea of opening up is hell of scary.

I'm not mad at how most people feel. If I could take their pain away I would do it. But I can't. And I can't live like this anymore. My gf has stuck by my side but even this has been a strain on her. She has been my anchor and for that I am eternally grateful. But I don't want her to shoulder the weight of my past self. I don't want anyone including me to feel hurt.

I've just been feeling very sad and unmotivated from time to time for no reason at all, I just have random spurts of sadness and I'm just feeling unproductive all the time.

These random sadness episodes just stick around for a few hours at most, they're not suicidal thoughts, they're not telling me mean things, they're just stopping me from doing anything, like getting out of bed, doing homework, doing work in general, etc.

I can still feel happiness, I'm still my usual happy extroverted self when I'm with my friends and I love them with all of my heart, they make me feel genuinely happy whenever I'm with them, but when I'm not, I just do nothing but sleep and get nothing done.

Nothing is triggering this (i think), i have great friends, a lovely family, decent marks and a mediocre school. It's just that I'm stressed out from time to time I don't know what I'm stressed out about, I just am.

There are times where I manage to be productive, it's just that some minor activities are becoming more draining then usual, like doing schoolwork, washing the dishes, doing the laundry and getting up in general.

I'm also losing interest in the things I love the most, like drawing, playing video games, listening to music, etc.
I really want to get back into art again, because I want to be an professional artist when I grow up, but now I don't even know if I want to work in the art department in general.

I’m not sure if it’s depression but i don’t feel any kind of way? Maybe it was just a random spurt of crying but it’s bothering me a bit. Any advice is appreciated! ",03Apr2019,3
130,"My life is going well. I have a girlfriend who loves me, a job that I'm proud of and a father that loves me. But, theres just something in my head. It feels like it eats away at me. Something I mask in the day and rip off like a plaster when I'm alone. But what hurts the most is the fact that I dont actually have any reason for this and it holds so hard down on my heart it's like a physical slump when I think about it too hard. I just feel bad because my life isn't bad. But ignore the sadness until the point of a break down. I dont understand anymore. ",03Apr2019,3
131,"Hi, I am 16 years old and I'll try to explain my situation as best as I can and I hope someone could give me some advice. 
The last couple of months I feel like I'm not really there in the moment, days go by very fast, after I been to work for 6 hours it only felt like 10 minutes and I feel like I forgot a lot of details. I tried to google this and the thing that came up was depersonalization disorder but I don't feel like I'm watching myself from a distance but I do feel like something is odd in my life. I cannot really point out why I am feeling so different and I am not sure if I have been feeling like this all my life and I am only now realizing it, I really could not say since when I have been feeling so strange. I also feel like my memory has gotten a lot worse. I honestly feel like something is wrong and if someone could give me some advice, I would be really grateful.

132,"I’ve struggled with mental heath my whole life. Diagnosed with anxiety. Medicated and have it under control. Only gets bad for me when stress in my life mounts up. 

I’ve never slept well. Recently I’ve taken major strides to improve my sleep. Including:
- Consistent sleep schedule (sleep hygiene)
- Stopped drinking before bed. Never drank heavy but used to have one or two before bed to come down. 
- Improved diet. Cut out all sugar. No big meals before bed. 

I still sleep like crap. Wake up feeling unrefreshed. I’m not depressed, my spirits are high but I’m definitely tired. 

I’ve been evaluated for sleep apnea, no issue. 

I suspect that my anxiety is unleashed in my sleep. Whenever I do remember my dreams, which is fairly infrequent, it is always very disturbing or stressful. Not to get too Freudian, but I think I can’t apply the coping strategies I am able to apply in my conscious state in my subconscious state. I’ve tried lucid dreaming and I’m just too gullible, even the most insane dreams I think are really happening. 

How can I take control of my mind when I’m asleep? I feel like if I could have peaceful dreams I would sleep better. ",03Apr2019,1
133,"As the title says, I have no feelings toward other people. I can feel a wide variety of feelings - albeit a bit suppressed - outside of interacting with people, but I'm emotionally dead when it comes to people.

See a hurt animal? I feel pity.

A family member just died? I feel nothing.

A puppy runs up to me and licks my face? I feel happy.

Someone tells me I mean a lot to them, and they hug me? I feel nothing.

I'm out eating by myself? I feel at rest and relaxed.

I'm out eating with friends? I feel nothing.

Sure, ""nothing"" is a bit exaggerated, but it's a good enough approximation. I don't know what this is, but it doesn't seem right to me.",03Apr2019,4
134,"I've been surfering with BPD for almost 2 years now but have only recently been diognosed properly for about 2 weeks waist in the past I've been treated for depression and anxiety. It's good to get come clarity as I believed there was no hope for me and that I was going crazy. My mood constantly switches which is the hardest part of it, as for one hour I'll be convinced I need to kill myself and the next I'll be fine as if nothing happend. Its confusing and the issue is now that the idea of having BPD is making me suicidal and depressed. I have lost time with friends, family and my university life is almost non exisitent where I am close to failing. Its got to the point where even when I'm ""myself"" and not in any of these states that I can't focus anymore. I've lost sense of who I am and I'm 19. I know there is time to recover with being young, but its also came at a bad time with university. I don't know what to do as the treatment avalible to me therpy which I'm unsure if it will help. It helps to vent but in the end it doesn't offer much way of development. I'm scared that one day I may give in and finally kill myself. I know this is mainly venting but there arn't many people I can talk to about this.

136,"Does anyone else have trouble keeping up with basic hygiene like brushing their hair when they’re feeling depressed/anxious?

My hair is completely tangled in  knots. I hide it well under a bun, but I feel like a piece of shit for not taking care of it. It’s impossible to get through and some parts are completely matted. This doesn’t even include other parts of my self care I’ve neglected as well. 

 I look like I have my shit together on the outside but I constantly feel overwhelmed with work, life, past trauma, etc. I have a great life with a great job that I do well in,  awesome girlfriend, friends/family but my mental health gets so bad that I can barely take care of myself.

Also... I feel like the majority of reviews on this drug are pretty negative. I’m hoping to find people that have had a positive experience. I am super anxious about the withdrawals people say they experience after tapering off.  I really just wanted someone to take for situational anxiety, for when it is really bad. But it looks like she prescribed me something I have to take every day.

139,"So this is just gonna be a big blurb about me and my story, I want an opinion on what I’ve been dealing with over the past few months,


to start off with this I’m very concerned about myself and having psychosis or on the road to it. My life for the past year and half has been a reckless journey of pot smoking, mental strain, pain and agony. I’m 16 and my girlfriend and I have smoked pot daily for over a year. I think weed is becoming my everything and really the reason I’ve abused it so much is because my girlfriend and I have quite a few sever mental issues already and have seemed marijuana as a means to alleviate those symptoms. I’ve been so depressed and anxious for a lot of my life and weed has helped through a lot of that stress. I believe weed isn’t productive for my well being and I realize that but my addiction is so out of control that I have no will to even try to stop, this is consequently on the way to explaining my first reason to why I think psychosis is overcoming me.  Psychosis is characterized by three stages, the prodrome stage, the active phase, and recovery. I feel as if I am in the late prodrome stage and have been for quite some time. My belief is that since weed can cause acute schizophrenia in young individuals who are susceptible to it and the prodrome phases of schizophrenia correlate with my behaviour over the last few months i must be on the way to a dark awakening.  Consistently throughout almost everyday my symptoms are as follows
I have little to no emotion 
My school is painful and my drive to do well has suddenly fallen completely away from me
My grades have went from an honour role student in 9th grade to having a 60% average and now increasingly going down as the days go 
I’ve noticed a drastic change in my self care, I rarely remember to brush my teeth and frequently Miss days to shower
I cannot fathom the possibility to make friends because I have lost almost every one of them and only have my girlfriend for support, who believes I don’t have psychosis so for her I have little support in this arena
My ability to control my anger and irritabile behaviours has decreased drastically, I frequently respond to stress in a negative and emotional way like smashing things and yelling and throwing fits to my parents and being completely in the wrong but so emotionally charged and out of control that it feels right I can’t seem to figure out my emotions and I feel trapped in my own head racing thoughts about becoming psychotic and nobody ever understanding me 
I feel like a failure and my family hates me, I’ve had concurrent thoughts about being kicked out of my house because of my lack of care towards things and disrespectmy parents feel like I’m doing to them when I’m very internally struggling.
My family believes I don’t care and have mentioned to me frequently on how I show no care and no remorse towards my actions. They feel as if I don’t care about them and when they talk to me they always get very angry because of the blank stare my dad calls it when i talk to him. I can never understand what I’m doing wrong and am always battling with what to say and feel like whatever I do and say I am being judged by someone. My parents don’t get my pain and get extremely agitated to the point of yelling at me because of my complaints about myself and what I believe is happening.  I can’t get out of my head half the time and I can hardly finish a simple task without becoming distracted. 
I’ve also experienced a few psychotic episodes well on weed but when I was on a much bigger dose than I was use to at the time and I became extremely transient and everything was fuzzy and lucid at the same time, I couldn’t walk and I was pale as a ghost, I sat down and I couldn’t see or talk all I could do was try to make out where I was and what was happening and my anxiety was through the roof my heart was beating faster than I’ve ever known, I remember laying down and trying to remember how to breath and then becoming startled by myself when I looked in the mirror, my body felt crippled and the dizziness was so extreme I almost threw up. I’m sorry for how long this got but someone please help I need someone’s opinion on this because nobody understands me and I’ve never fully explained it in such depth.

Edit: I’ve also went to the doctor numerous times and been diagnosed with the most extreme levels of anxiety and depression and he seemed to dismiss when I mentioned psychosis as a risk factor, he prescribed me with 100 mg Zoloft and I’ve been on them for a month now.

142,"Hi. Only mental diagnosis I have is GAD. My whole life I’ve had terrible guilt issues (I’m 21) but they seemed to peak and get a lot worse when I turned maybe 17. I recently left an abusive relationship but I am absolutely racked with guilt over it. I worry my ex will get hurt or get into trouble or even die in his sleep. I always looked after him and took care of him, even when he was berating me or waking me up in the middle of the night to tell me I was a whore. I’m seeing my therapist this weekend, but does anyone have any tips for dealing with this guilt? I feel so alone :(",03Apr2019,1
143,"I \[23M\] was in a relationship with a woman for two years who threatened to kill herself regularly whenever I spent time with other people or didn't pick up the phone or left the apartment, cried constantly, and would wake me up in the middle of the night screaming at me for various reasons.   


I have experienced mental health issues in the two years since as fallout from this: anxiety I'll run into her whenever I'm in public, being anxious when my phone rings, and I've always had issues with depression which this didn't help.  

&amp;#x200B;

She had some mental health issues of her own at the time and I really don't want to blame her for what she did but it also hurts to know that none of our mutual friends know what happened. I stopped speaking to all of them because it became difficult for me, and I know that she has a partner now which is also oddly difficult. Is it okay for these things to bother me after so long? I'm able to recognize what I went through as somewhat abusive now, so I guess what I really want to know is how do other people who have been through similar relationships cope with it?

144,"I dont really know how to start this so ill just get into it.
Tried to seek help and my doctor wrote a letter to a local mental health center but I got rejected. Feel like killing myself now almost more than ever. I guess my doctor didnt fully understand the severity of my state. I told him everything was getting worse and i dont know my self anymore, but he kept implying that my problems where most popular amongst women. (Like hitting and punishing myself) I just felt way worse leaving from that doctor appointment. My life has just gone down hill since age 15. Tried to kill myself at 16 but my weak ass chickend out. Was diagnosed with major depression and GAD later that year but i left the clinic because they kept switch therapists and it was a mess. My mind is a fucking cluster of emotions and self hatred. Ive pushed eveyone away and my anxiety is at its peak. Paranoid to shit and my self destructive behaviour is ruining my life. I cant find the courage to keep going like this, especially after i got denied help. I took me so long to seek help again and this is the 2nd time it goes to shit. I just want to find out what the hell is up with me but it looks like suicide is going to be the end of my short dark tunnel.

Sorry for venting and thanks to whoever takes their time to read this. Feel free to ask me anything, this is a throwaway.",03Apr2019,2
