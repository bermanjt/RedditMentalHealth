1,"So I’ve been together with my SO for about 1 month. We have so much in common and we’re very comfortable with each other. She’s been nothing short of amazing with me. She’s supportive, caring, and loving. She’s the first girlfriend I’ve had that I truly fell in love with. But I worry that my anxiety is gonna put a strain on me and our relationship. Whenever I’m with her, I’m blissful and I don’t worry about anything. But when she’s gone, I start getting anxious and my mind starts racing. Then the irrational thoughts start creeping in. I always think about if I’m doing enough for her, and that I don’t want to lose her because she makes me so happy, and I try not to put a weight on her shoulders by always talking about my anxiety. Now it’s starting to progress to the point where even the thought of her gives me anxiety. I have attachment issues because I lacked love and affection growing up so that’s probably adding to my problem. I also have a low self esteem. I just want to be able to control my anxiety and not get stressed whenever she’s gone because it’s not healthy spending every waking moment with your SO. Anyone have any advice? Thanks",15May2019,2
2,"Had counseling today. Was having a great day. Left about on the verge of a panic attack. I'm just so frustrated with myself and with the process. I want to feel better but how does feeling worse help me in that quest? I know counseling is confronting instead of avoiding. But I don't have any answers about why I feel the way I feel, just that I do and it sucks. I don't know how I'm supposed to gain insight when talking about stuff almost sends me over the edge. I'm glad it didn't become a full panic attack, but it was close and it's the worst feeling.",15May2019,1
3,For the passed couple of years I’ve been going through some stuff that I have always been strong enough to get through. But since I started puberty and went to a public middle school again where the students are still and have always been so judgmental about how I dress and how I laugh or even how much money my family has. I was able to ignore them until recently when I started feeling changes not from puberty but from how I treated others. I became angry and lashed out at others for small things. I’ve always been a family man but as much as I try I can’t be myself around them anymore because I’m scared that Theyll stop loving me. Does any one know what’s going on I feel so over whelmed all the time and I just want to be myself again. Any advice or something?,15May2019,1
4,"Hi. I'm posting this here because I honestly dont know what to do. Everyone keeps saying it gets better if you reach out and nothing has changed. I still cry, I still wish I wasnt here and I still dont see the point in anything. My best friend keeps telling me to talk to someone about it but doesn't realise hes the person I'm trying to talk to. I know you dont use reddit but if you ever see this I'm sorry for sometimes seeming off. I'm sorry for never being able to fully explain why I feel like this and I'm sorry for joking about wanting to kill myself. I just wish you would see behind the smile and realise that sometimes all it takes is a text or a snapchat or a phone call.  I dont know how much longer I can do this. It gets  harder and harder every day and I'm just so tired of feeling like this.

tl;dr at bottom

I think I'm scared of women, my social anxiety on top of my realization has stranded me into a feeling of always being alone

I've been single for about two years now. I've had a lot of relationships both close and long distance ever since i was 15. I hate myself, I truly despise everything about me. I'm my worst critic. Out of all of my relationships I've had (about 10), I've only dumped one of them and all the others have dumped me, all of them dramatically and not in healthy ways.

I'm trying to keep this as short as possible but let me try to explain my situation. I'm a three time suicide attempt survivor, bipolar, potentially autistic, PTSD plagued young man because of a lot of crap I won't go over in my life and the relationships are a small tad bit of said crap. After my last few relationships, I can firmly say I think I've grown scared of women and it pisses me off that I have grown this way.

My social anxiety kicks me in the face every time I try to meet new people, doesn't matter if my intent is to try to be friends or as a potential romantic interest. I've been going between a few jobs the last couple years, my hours at my current job suck. I live in northern Indianapolis and have a decent bit of things to go do around me, but I feel like I'm too scared to leave the house sometimes because trauma dating back to high-school and previous relationships terrifies me into submission to want to cut myself off from the world.

I live with my family. Late 50s grandma, low 40s mother, second grader half sister (same mom). I feel like I'm a huge burden to them all the time, I try to help out any way I can, but they all feel too confrontational to me 80% of the time. I want to move out, but my last few jobs haven't been that great pay and hour wise to even be able to save enough to because all my money would go to helping out family or basic needs, I did spend a bit too much on entertainment stuff from time to time but I've been doing a lot better about that recently.

I want to try to escape from my shell, to try to find another partner. My last couple romantic partners really messed me up mentally, last one even accused me and my best friend of rape (I never even slept with her). I've been slowly trying to better myself but I know I need more work. I feel like my situation and my depression would just turn women away. I'm terrified of first impressions because of my living situation and how terrible my mental health is. I've been to several therapists and am even on medication as well, I'm trying, but it just feels like a vicious and repetitive loop I can't escape.

I'm trying to be more healthy, take care of myself better, but I feel like there's no point sometimes because of how stuck I am. I have no real reason to even get out of bed sometimes I feel like. I've been trying to go outside at least an hour or two a day just doing....something...not much really, just to get some sunlight to try to feel better the last couple months, but I don't feel any different at all. Honestly, if my mom didn't find me after my second suicide attempt I wouldn't be here right now. I chickened out of my first one, and my third one ended....comically to put it bluntly.

A good majority of my friends are long distance friends I've met online through various websites I frequent. All the people I grow close to in person from work or whatever I just distance myself from almost instantly because I feel too scared to really dedicate my time to people in fear of going through hurtful experiences again, or I just don't keep enough contact with any of them and we just grow apart. I want to meet new people, but I just don't have any money to go do anything anymore.

I can't drive, my anxiety and PTSD flare up too bad and make me freeze whenever I try to drive. I was in a bad accident with my grandmother when I was 17 in driver's ed with my grandma that terrified me out of continuing with it, I thought she was going to die. I feel like I just can't grow up and have no sense of responsibilities despite me knowing full well a lot of issues I have to address. Every time I try to better one thing about me, 5 other things get worse or regress.

Whenever I felt like I was in love however, those were probably the times I felt absolutely the best and most at peace in a decade. It gave me reason to want to get better and fix myself. But after all of them ending terribly I've grown worse and worse. Hobbies don't feel fun anymore, things I used to love I hate now, I can't focus, I can't sleep at decent hours, I panic almost every day, my mood swings make me have terrible panic attacks and crying fits randomly whenever I realize how badly my life is in shambles.

I don't feel like there's even a point more than half the time. Outside of a few of my friends, I feel like me being gone would just be a benefit to everyone. Every time I feel like I need to go back to therapy, I just realize how much money I still owe from my last few therapists. I'm a lost cause.  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR: I'm stuck in my shitty situation of endless depression and self loathing and am too scared of people to make friends or find romance anymore.

Sorry about the wall of text but I needed to vent this somewhere.",15May2019,1
7,"I have always had a quick temper but in the past 5 years or so i have grown to having vivid daydreams  about harming the worst of the worst (rapist,serial killers,terrorists) and im scared about the fact that i would like to do these things and as much as it disturbs me i cant prevent feeling ecstatic when i think of these things what can i do to talk about these things without appearing like a madman",15May2019,1

9,After exploding to a family member they insisted I get some help. But I don’t even know where to start looking. How do I know if I should see a therapist/counselor or a psychiatrist? Or do I see a therapist first and if they think I need it they will refer me to a psychiatrist?,15May2019,2
10,"Last year I lived in an assisted living/residental care home (however you wann call it) and I had the worst experience of my life.

I heard my neighbour having extreme loud sex with his then girlfriend and I completely lost it. I broke down crying in the bathroom and locked myself in there. 
I couldnt enter my room without nc headphones cause I'd never know when or when they wouldnt have Sex after that day (it happened quite a few times that they took me by surprise). It got so bad I had to hide in my boyfriend flat and that I even heard them when the girlfriend wasnt around and I was just visiting my boyfriend who lived in that home too. 
Eventually the neighbour got kicked out due to that and some other stuff. I enjoyed silence for a few months after that. A couple months back I moved out and my brain mistakes almost every noise for someone having Sex that comes from the flat above me. 

Does anyone have a clue why I acted the way I did back then and now?
And why I am in like a constant state of anxiety? 
I have no idea why I broke down crying the First time I heard it. 

Thanks for reading",15May2019,1
11,"Several times a week, I wake up shortly after falling asleep with my heart pounding as though I just woke up from a nightmare. For several seconds, I have no sense of identity or reality, confused on who I am or what all of “this” is. I get anxious, breathless and can hear my rapidly beating heart. 
After I come back to reality, I try to fall asleep again, but the anxiety intensifies and won’t go away until I fully awaken myself by sitting up or reaching out to my phone. Almost always, my breathing gets heavy and I rush out of the bed to open the window and breathe fresh air while shaking intensely. When the cold weather finally hits me and I can no longer stand there, I go back to my bed, trying not to think about negative stuff. But the sensation of emptiness and loneliness is still there and it’s hard to ignore it. Loneliness in a sense that if I happen to collapse, nobody will be able to help me. The presence of my roommates only amplifies this feeling of helplessness because I can’t really depend on them and wouldn’t want to bother them with anything.  
This whole sensation feels like some sort of brain bug and there’s nothing I can do to make it go away until it does. This is all such a hazy process, as though i’m not even fully there. Sometimes it feels like this happens to me unconsciously and continuously every night and this running towards the window and opening it the same way has become almost like a ritual for my half-asleep self to perform. The next day however, it feels like nothing has happened and most of the time I never even think of these occurrences until they happen again. 
So what could these mini, half-conscious panic sprees be telling about my mental state? Is it neurosis? Anything to help it?",15May2019,1
12,"Hello, this is my first time on this sub and it seems like a great place to ask if I should get mental illness screenings. 

Context: my name is caden, I'm 13 years old Male and im going thourgh pUbErTy like many other teens I have hormonal changes yadda yadda yadda but for the past year or so I've been having extreme feelings of helplessness and loneliness.

My question: should I come out to my parents about me scratching/cutting myself? I feel like my parents would just shrug it off as ""hormonal changes"" but I dont think fatigue, self harm, suicidal thoughts, and mild insomnia comes from puberty. I've been having a very big obsession/crush on my best friend and now that I'm moving this summer I feel lost, confused, and helpless.
I've always been a bright cheerful kid and never once did I think I would be hurting myself in less than 3 years. I feel like it would be too much for my parents to handle if I came out to them about my self harm 

Any reply would be helpful",15May2019,2
13,"Hi all, im kind of new to these sorts of subs. I mainly just updoot pics of cute dogs and crap, so please bear with me.

I've struggled with my mental health ever scince I have been able to be diagnosed with mental problems. (ASD, anxiety, depression, the average sorts of problems) Me and my family have struggled to help me, even moving to get access to better support. I know the fight for sustainable mental wellness is nowhere near over. So far, ive been admitted to hospital twice for suicide attempts, but i'm not going to elaborate too much because I dont feel that it affected me very much in any way ( but  I will elaborate if one of you guys wants me to to get a better understanding of the situation)

It has been about three months scince the last hospital stay, and I made it into an adolescent day treatment program. Psycologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and family counselers will be available at all times, and i will see them about one a week for 12 weeks. 

Im really grateful for this opportunity, because lately I've been feeling a tad... funky lately.

I've noticed that lately when i'm not in a numb haze where I don't know whats going on (this has been so extreme that people have suspected im high on something, even though i'm not), that i'm either extremely resentful and angry (like columbine angry) toward my ex-friends (whole 'nother can of worms, but they really don't like me. Just Yestarday they said they'd break my legs and that nobody wants to be seen with me), or hopeless and depressed, unable to shake the feeling of existential dread of being untreatable and eventually killing myself, or being manic and excited, ready to make some rash decisions and dye my hair neon green. (Ive already done bright red lol)

I suspect a personality disorder, given how unpredictable these states can come on, but i'm no expert.

What would be the best way to bring this up with someone there, and who should it be? Should i lay all the cards down on the table or should I only say what seems appropriate at the time?",15May2019,1
14,"I’m not looking for someone to diagnose me. I just want a better understanding of what I might be dealing with here. I have always been, for lack of a better word; “off,” in one way or another. I have had the luxury of being born a twin, and my sister has always been the socially dominant one. She’s really the one friend I have ever had. 

Anyways, I have been reading around trying to understand myself a bit better and I realized I connect with a lot of things people on the spectrum have and go through. If I do have Aspergers, than I have had a lot of work put into me throughout my life to perceived as “normal”. 

When I was little, I would daydream constantly to the point where I would be totally removed from a conversation. This behavior was noted multiple times throughout my elementary by teachers, some were patient, others were not.  I still do, but I have learned to control it much better. 

My whole life I have needed to be in motion in order to fully grasp my thoughts. I pace around a lot. And I have some habits that people will consider strange. I need to do things over and over to get a clear head, when I was little I would go outside and go on my swing- for hours several times a day. Then it evolved into pacing up and down the hall, to throwing a ball against the wall, to dribbling a soccer ball indoors- which is my current habit that I do for hours at a time- it’s the only way I can get my thoughts straight. 

These repetitive behaviors all have the same overarching back and forth motion, and despite how long and often I have done and still do some of them, I never let it interfere with work I need to get done. I would not allow that- neither would my parents. My parents known of my repetitive habits, which I suspect is me stimming, they don’t really say much about it. It doesn’t cause any disturbance to my ability to get school stuff done, I have a job too, and a very visible one as well. I am a soccer referee and I officiate games as both a center and sideline official. I only “center” for kids up the age of 12, but I am a sideline official for kids as old as college age (and I’m 18). It’s a tough job with a lot of pressure, but it is something I am very precise at. My sister and I and among the most the sought after sideline officials in our state, our assignor gets a lot of requests for us. 

When I was younger, my parents had to strenuously coach me in eye contact. I wouldn’t do it with anyone. If I did look someone in the eyes I would cover my mouth when I spoke. This took about four or five years to correct. Kind of like the daydreaming, they would constantly get on me to get control over that. I’m not mad at them, it’s just that looking back I realize just how involved my parents were in molding my behavior and getting me to become more comfortable being “out”. 

I was very quiet, I still am. Social awkwardness used be very very bad too. Like I was incapable of building basic connections with people other than my twin pretty much through middle school. I began to mimic other girls’ behavior, they way they talked, what they talked about (even if I didn’t personally like it). This tactic taught me social cues and how to talk, slowly but surely I started to talk to others on my own. My mom saw me after the eighth grade orchestra concert talking to two girls “normally” and she couldn’t believe I was the same person.  

I have mini “obsessions” with really obscure movies or concepts. And I hold onto these phases for long periods of time. I could look at a timeline of my life and tell you just how long my obsession lasted and what it was. I only have one or two at a time that occupies the majority of my thinking when I pace around or dribble for hours. 

Today I am a senior in high school. I communicate in a way that is deemed typical. I have awkward moments still, because I have always had trouble reading others. I am incapable of telling if someone likes me or someone else. I occasionally struggle to get my words out, and end up stuttering them out. My friends affectionately label me as quirky. But I know if they knew of some of my other habits they’d be a little confused. 

Another thing with female aspies I have in common with is a weak concept of gender identity and sexual orientation. I am not childish, I understand most people my age have such thoughts and desires. But I don’t, and I have a weak-almost-none-existent identification with being a girl/woman. I will be exploring the possibility of not being cis once I go to college. 

I am going away to college. I know I will be fine, I have been in situations where I can’t pace or dribble for prolonged periods of time and I am totally ok with that. Its really not compulsory, it’s a habit, something that relaxes me. But like the day dreaming, and the social crutches, and all the other “odd” behaviors I have shown my whole life, it will have to go. And I am determined to rid myself of the pacing/dribbling for good by leaving.  

Many aspies get therapies to help them with their symptoms. I wonder if I basically got the same thing from my parents over the years, who are very patient people. My mother worked for almost ten years as an aide for autistic children, I’ve asked her if they ever thought about me. She said she was never sure, but whatever she helped me with worked. I was previously medicated for anxiety and depression, and I have been six months off meds. Nothing has changed, on and off the medication. 

The pacing/dribbling habit to me is my strongest indication that I am not neurotypical, combined with many of my behaviors needing to be corrected throughout my life(which I forgot to add, my twin sister never needed such corrections), an “off”  gender identity, and the fact that I have needed medication. 

The only indication I think that would suggest otherwise is my performance in athletics. I hate to get bogged down in stereotypes, but every single aspie/autistic person I have met has not been a good athlete. Autistic professional athletes do exist and I am aware. However, they are the rare exception. I am on three varsity level teams at my high school, I am a talented basketball player one of the best on my team, and I am incredibly coordinated at soccer. My best sport is track, which is what I will be doing in college. 

I have had a lot positive reinforcement my whole life, which could explain a lot of things. But I know my whole life I have had to work a lot harder to “fit in”, I had to do a lot of personal bending into shape. I know this is a lot to process and I’m not asking for an type of professional opinion, but if anyone shares an experience, it would mean worlds to help me out. I know this was a long bit of writing.",15May2019,1
15,"I've been seeing her alone for about 2 years now, and I've been sharing stories/examples of my parents' emotional abuse. A few weeks ago, I pissed off my parents, so they told me they were coming to my next session to tell my therapist how ""disrespectful"" I'm being. They've come to my last 3 sessions, and now my therapist is treating me the same way they do-- gaslighting me, showing me I have no way out (""if you're parents threw you out of the house, where would you go? Do you have any friends that would let you squat for free?"" while knowing that I don't), and then said ""they've been so patient with you; they're only trying to help you out."" 

I know the right answer is ""change therapists"", but how can I do that with my parents so deeply involved? They can't know that *I'm* the one that made the switch; they're thrilled that she's telling me the same stuff. They think the more support ought to put me back in my place.",15May2019,7

Anyways, Society always says things like ""foot fetishists are creeps,"" ""foot fetishes are unnatural and abnormal,"" ""if you have a foot fetish, you're a bad person and should feel bad,"" etc. I need some advice on how to not care about what other people think of my foot fetish. It's degrading when people shun us foot fetishists for something that makes us attracted to feet and something that isn't hurting anybody.

Hey 

So I have had anxiety and health anxiety for years I have been able to in last few months been able to tell myself I'm just anxious and not dying from a medical condition however a few weeks ago I had a near-death experience and Im lucky to be alive...

I was 100% ok walking around my kitchen when I felt my heart go funny and I felt like impending doom I assumed I was anxious so I sat on a high stool and woke up on the floor unconscious unable to move and I was home alone and I knew something was wrong I felt like Id been hit by a truck and my head hurt so I crawled down the hall to my phone and called an ambulance and waited alone for 2 hours for the ambulance and essentially I ended up having a very severe case of saddle pulmonary embolism; I had dozens of large blood clots in each lung that essentially caused my heart to be damaged and give out. I was rushed to ICU and given very aggressive meds directly into my lungs to save me. I was in ICU for 9 days and I according to my docs am lucky to he alive and they were very worried and its a miracle I even woke up when I collapsed. I had no symptoms of clots or embolism and I have no risk factors and they have no clue why it happened to an otherwise healthy 19-year-old. I am now on heavy blood thinning meds for the rest of my life and need to be monitored often. 

Im now terrified to be alone, I cant sit on any stool at the breakfast bar. I also have been very highly health anxious and can't rationalise my anxiety anymore.

I remained on my existing medication (Celexa) and was additionally put on Wellbutrin to help with my apathy that comes with my depression and my compulsive behaviors. 

It’s been kind of up and down for me? The drug is prescribed to help raise energy levels in a person, which naturally causes restlessness and anxiety, so in result, my anxious ticks have gotten a little worse, manifesting into new ones that are effecting my face instead of just my hands and chest. My compulsions have been a little less frequent, I don’t feel the need to triple check locks and things but my paranoia has remained level which still concerns me. My energy levels related to my depression, however, have significantly improved! I’ve had a lot more drive to get things done and make sure I’ve tied off all my obligations, my things are organized, etc. 

You win some you lose some I guess??

Side note: the meds have also made me a lot more talkative. I find myself not being able to stop talking or finding more need to speak up than I had before. this isn’t necessarily a negative or a positive? it’s just interesting",15May2019,1
20,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Obligatory not sure if this is the right place for this, however it popped into my head while talking with my mate earlier about my mum that I could try looking through Reddit for potential help.

&amp;#x200B;

So, background, my mum had me and my oldest brother when she was in her early-mid 20's, I am now 20 myself with my brother being 17. This was from my mother's first marriage to my father, who we see on a regular basis so there is no underlying stuff there. However, about 6-8 years after divorcing my dad, she met my current stepdad, and they got married a few years later. While my stepdad has been nothing but supportive of me and my brother, because he is about 10 years younger than my mum, he's always wanted kids of his own. I'm not sure of the details here because I've never asked, I'm purely going off what my mum has said off the cuff. She didn't want any more kids, she'd done her time and was basically at the point where she could reclaim her life as an adult rather than just a mother. However, she ended up having two more kids with my stepdad, my two little brothers who we all adore.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where things get messy. I've seen a profound change in my mum since these two were born, and not for the better. She's always had a bit of anxiety, but it's way worse now and she overall seems much less happy than she was. She constantly goes on about dying and how no one would miss her, and says how useless she is all the time. This is heartbreaking for me as she essentially raised me and my oldest brother on her own for many years, she's a brilliant mother and a fantastic role model. She's my strength, and since she constantly goes on about dying, I now think all the time about how terrible my life would be if she were to die. There are no words. It would destroy me. But no matter what I say, she just brushes it off. Having anxiety myself, this doesn't help my mental state, since I feel hopeless and terrible for her, and I don't know how to help her which just makes me spiral. She says she's been to see two therapists already, but that they didn't help at all and she doesn't want to be seen as a person with mental issues since her and my stepdad may look into adoption so my mother can have a little girl.

&amp;#x200B;

It's breaking my heart, I don't know what to do or how to help her. And I desperately want to. If anyone has any advice, I'm open to any suggestions at this point.",15May2019,1

Have you ever felt de-motivated, lethargic or like you couldn’t bring yourself to care about anything? If you’re like me then you’ve probably felt this way before but was unsure as to why. Today, here on Reddit, I am going to share with you my personal experience overcoming burnout in college and how you can use my strategies to ensure you maintain proper physical and mental health in your own academic journey. Now here’s my story…

It was a Friday night in march and I had survived another grueling week of intense studying and exams in my masters in accounting program. Whereas I was usually full of energy on a Friday night, I found myself rather lethargic, not having much of an appetite which for me was rather unusual. As most Fridays in university went, my phone was exploding with messages to come party and not wanting to be the odd man out I got myself together and met up with my friends. As I was at the bar, I started to feel even more tired and told my friends I had to sit down. My friends returned to the dancefloor and as they returned to check up on me they found me passed out on the floor. I woke up the next morning but instead of being in my bed I was at the hospital with one of my best friends by my side. He filled me in on what had happened and the only thing I could think of was that I had to get home to study! As the doctor came into the room, she explained to me that my body was overworked and that I needed to take better care of myself to avoid this happening again. My prognosis was simple: burnout.
 
As I laid there in the hospital bed, I knew I never wanted to go through that horrific experience again but I didn’t know how to change my lifestyle to avoid burning out again. I felt like I always had so much to do and that I couldn’t afford to take anything out of my busy schedule. But if I didn’t I was destined to end up back in the hospital or worse…

I spent the next week at home recovering from this traumatic event when my friend Justin came to visit. Justin was a great student and an awesome friend and he always amazed me as to how he could manage juggling so many of his life responsibilities like school, work and exercise. I then asked Justin, “You do more than me how do you avoid burning out?”. What he told me changed the course of my academic career and my health forever…

Justin began to explain that building good study habits is one of ways he avoids burning out. He explained that there are two types of students: the effective and non-effective studiers. The effective studiers allocate a couple hours to their notes and focus without distractions. The non-effective studiers set no time restrictions on their review but allow themselves to work with Facebook open, music playing and their phone by their side. Sadly, the second scenario resonated with me. Justin said that he used the time he saved to relax, go out with friends and be social all while obtaining some of the top marks in our program. This tip alone blew my mind so I pleaded to Justin to share some more of his secrets.

Justin went on to explain that he used to constantly double book his commitments causing him to stress out which I knew that I too found myself guilty of doing. He then pulled out his IPhone and showed me how he now tracks all of his classes, work shifts and social outings on his Google Calendar. Hearing this suggestion, I began to kick myself as I was wasting time on useless apps like Facebook and Instagram when I should have been using apps to organize my schedule and ultimately help avoid the burnout that I fell victim to. 

Seeing his busy schedule on his Google Calendar, I had to ask, “Do you ever sleep?”. He laughed and told me that sleep is critical to his academic success and avoiding burnout. Justin highlighted how so many students in college like to brag about how many all-nighters they pull each semester but in his research, sleep was not to be neglected. Not surprisingly, he cited one study that showed that students, like Justin, who obtain the best marks sleep 8 or more hours per night. Admittedly, getting more sleep made sense but if you’re like me then wanting to get more sleep and actually getting more sleep can be challenging so I inquired how Justin ensured he regularly got eight plus hours of sleep.

He responded with one word: No. I was confused at first but then Justin explained to me that saying no is the key to protecting the time he needs to study, exercise and sleep. In college, it can be easy to get wrapped up in all the parties and extracurricular events. However, these events can easily begin to detract from your ability to focus on the activities that are the most important to academic success and health. Justin explained that whenever he is asked to take part in any activity that interferes with his pre-planned study, exercise or sleep commitments in his calendar then he automatically turns them down in order to preserve the time he needs to maintain his health and mental well-being. Right at this point in his explanation, Justin’s phone sounded and he was off to the gym.

Fast forward two months and I was back in exam time, the same period that a few months prior had sent me to the hospital. Luckily, this time I was prepared. I had all my study periods blocked off in my calendar, I studied without distractions and ensured that I slept as much as I could. That exam period, I wrote four challenging exams and to my delight, I scored in the top 10% of my class on all of them! But better yet, I had zero trips to the hospital which I can thank my friend Justin for.

Hope this helps someone who may be experiencing similar feelings. There is a way to avoid burnout!",15May2019,1
22,"It... sucks... so... much... I know I made another post about this 1 month ago or so but things have not gotten better at all

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm way too out of options. It's... idk.

I'm 23, male. Was bullied a lot in my high school years due to my appearance and I got depressed as heck because I believed very strongly that my appearance would make people not want to be my friends or connect with me. Thankfully I was proven wrong when people actually started wanting to go out with me and that got me out of a very dangerous hole.

I'm back in it once again so hurray for that. This time I now strongly believe I can't connect with people because of my personality. And the worst part of this is not knowing wtf I am doing wrong and how the hell to fix it. At least when you are being bullied for how you look, people tell you what's wrong. When your personality sucks for some reason people just... aren't there. There's no feedback.

This all started because of a freaking crush. I never had feelings for her so it was just a platonic thing. Then another guy came along and she was a totally different person around him. He's extremely high energy and always joking around, often at the expense of other people. He also manages to be calm, but most of the time he is this ""funny"" high energy guy. I'm more of a calm, quiet guy. I wouldn't call myself shy, I just... am not like him. So for example a big group of us went into another town, a restaurant owner approached us and went ""Are you guys from (town X)"". This other guy starts laughing at him and goes ""AHAHAH pal you tried"". He then told this story to some girls that were with us (even though they all saw it) several times (!!!) and they all thought his response was hilarious and kept laughing. Meanwhile, me and another guy went and actually talked to the guy, made a few small casual jokes, he gave us a discount for dinner. Cool dude.

However, this girl I had a friendship with started going all over this guy. I could be having a drink with him at the bar, she would be sitting down, and would call me to call him to sit down with her. She wouldn't invite me to sit down with her (or both of them), she would just ask me to invite him. Wtf. This was consistent. Eventually I got fed up and we cut contact off. I kinda don't regret it because I was being mistreated af, but I don't feel good about it because she was treating the other guy a lot better, so clearly it was something wrong with me. Afaik they aren't dating (she's still dating her boyfriend, invites him to dinners where her boyfriend will be present, etc.) but their friendship is a lot, a lot closer than mine ever was, both physically (head on should, arms around each other, leaning into each other) and in any other way (she invites him out for lunch and dinner, they go to each other's house, etc., whereas I was always the one inviting).

The thing is, after this I realized I started believing I couldn't make this type of deep connection with anyone. I don't feel this connected with anyone right now. Sure, most people think I'm a cool, funny guy. It's not like I'm incapable of making people laugh and have fun. And yea most people have no problem if I meet them at a bar and sit down with them. But I don't have anyone who invites me out for dinners, I don't have anyone who puts their head on my shoulder, etc.

I don't even feel connected to my closest group of friends, who I've known for 3 years. 3 of these ""friends"" are the ones closest to me physically (everyone else is on a different town) and yet I don't feel connected with them at all. And right now, I'm pretty sure they cut me off completely. We used to have a group chat where we'd invite each other for coffee, and it went dead like 3 days ago; I've found out they are going out between themselves, off the group.

Meanwhile I have to go to class everyday, I have to watch that dude talk with the other girl, her putting her head on his shoulder or otherwise seeking his attention constantly, I have to watch every other person laughing at his jokes and thinking they are hilarious... and it's just... too much. I can't handle it. I've been going to therapy for 6 months now, had a 6 hour session today, and... it isn't helping. It just isn't. I feel like shit. I feel unloved, unwanted, everything you want to call it. I thought these times were behind me, yeay well guess not. She has asked me to stop going to classes and try to piece myself back together and study at home and talk to other people until I feel ready to go back into that high-stress environment again. Yea I don't know if that's going to go well. SO fucking sick of this shit.",15May2019,1
23,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I'm not entirely versed in reddit beyond yt videos so here we go.

I'm 22. In middle school / high school my physical and mental health began to deteriorate - I was diagnosed with bipolar and began to have major problems with anxiety (that got so bad in high school they eventually contributed to me having to leave public school). I've also had seizures since I was a baby and they kept me from doing pretty much anything: I wasn't allowed to go to other people's houses or hang out with anyone, I couldn't really play sports, my parents watched me like a hawk (which I think helped make my anxiety worse, but I digress). When I had to leave public school because my issues - both mental and physical - made it to where I couldn't leave my house at all, I eventually ended up getting a disability check. Since I was a minor, it was in my mom's name, technically, and when I turned 18 I had to go before a judge to see if he thought I was ""competent enough"" to have it switched into my name - he ruled I wasn't, so technically, my mom was still my guardian, as she still is today.

I started therapy in middle school and still go. I've had major trust issues with therapists because they've either blamed me entirely for my depression (saying I'm just ""feeling sorry for myself"", etc) or have been such a non-help that I've cycled through them, going to clinics in three counties surrounding me. In spite of this, I've found a case worker and my current therapist who have helped me quite a bit, and I'm slowly working through my anxiety (some days I find it hard to even face my own family, and I've had a few panic attacks so bad that I've been hospitalized, but I am getting better) and I haven't had a seizure in over a year. Now, since I feel like I'm better, I want to try to get a job or even go to college, because my health's prevented me from doing both.

I told my mom about this, and she said that I wasn't ready for a job. Every time I mention it, she says that. I try to tell her I want to try because I think I'm ready and it just feels like she demeans me because she says I'm ""not ready"" or I'm ""not stable enough"" and that she doesn't think I could handle it. She says it's too much responsibility for me and some other things that honestly hurt.

It makes me feel worse about myself and nearly pushes me back into a panic attack. I doubt myself whenever she says it and feel like maybe she's right but I still feel like I deserve the chance to at least try, and if I'm not ready, then that's just something we keep working on in therapy. I can't drive, I never got the chance to learn because of my seizures and every doctor I went to discouraged it, and since the town I live in doesn't have public transport (I guess the population is too small for them to have considered it), I'd have to depend on her to drive me to/from work if I were to get a job. How can I convince her that I deserve a chance? I feel like I need to do this. I have nothing in my life and I feel like a failure and it's pushing me back into depression. I feel like I'm suffocating and I don't know what to do.",15May2019,1

26,"The other day I was in French and it was going pretty good. Someone presented, and I talked to some people (in english), when time came to vote. We had to vote on a project like a tournament I think...
It's not important. My teacher said that each time we did not vote we would lose 2% from that project. Now I had to vote for some people who all confronted me at once, when I started feeling overwhelmed, and stressed. I listened to some music to calm down, but the teacher came over and asked for me to turn it off. Afraid to confront her about what was happening, I pretended I didnt hear, to the point where she took my music away along with 2 incomplete votes (4% of that project), where I left went to my locker and sort of just stood in the dark, crying. This could just be me stressing over marks, but its &gt;1% of my final mark, and this never happened before at school. This had only happened when I was with my friends ~1 yr ago when I was outside, a few people confronted me, where I went to a Bush for like 10 mins. After what happened on Monday, I've been more stressed around people, and been afraid to talk to them scared I would have a breakdown again. What should I do?

27,"We bumped up my depression medication (Paxil) and that kind of worries me. I’ve had it bumped up to 20mgs and now it will be at 30mgs. It’s probably nothing, but I’m still worried about everything.

I have an understanding of where my issues come from, why they exist, and what I fight with regularly. I still can’t shake this feeling that something else may be wrong, but every time I mention something, it gets twisted into something different.

I know my issues come from a lifetime of immense regret. As I’ve gotten older, I have dealt with being filled with guilt from all sides of my life. This guilt manifested in my mind as anxiety and depression. This is my fight to fight. But I just don’t know what to do to get better... or if I really want to know what that entails. I guess I’m just scared, but enough ranting.

Much love to you all, please take care of yourselves, you truly deserve to love yourselves. We’ve lost plenty of wonderful and loving people in this world who deal with battles similar to those of our own. I don’t want to lose any more. Know that when you think you are unloveable, you are loved. When you think no one cares, someone out there does. Don’t become a statistic, you deserve much more than a number. You deserve to be happy,loved and cherished. You deserve to get better, you deserve to be happy. Love you all.",15May2019,1
28,"I may not get responses here. It may be time to close my Reddit account out. 
My posts are generally ignored or invoke dissent and thats ok too.

It may not be the right venue for me

I've had private pay therapy in the past with PhD's &amp; M.D.'s yrs ago &amp; while in grad school.

None if it was managed care or health insurance controlled. 

Private pay allowed for more self-actualization &amp; free association. Nothing was notated by a specialist to be sent off to an unknown 3rd party case manager.

Today, my issues are complex.

I've shared numerous times here, &amp; rather than ""listening to understand,"" sometimes well meaning people would be 'quick to respond with:

* Did you try this? (Insert suggestion) 

* How bout that? (Insert suggestion)

* Why don't you just (suggestion)

Why is it when a person is in crisis, all of a sudden he/she is unable to engage in a fluid dialogue? Instead it becomes ""one sided"" like ""doctor patient."" And this is a community forum, not a trial. 

I may not be making sense here.

I didnt arrive at my situation overnight. It's cumulative. 

There is NO free anything in the U.S. to access. Those who get sliding scale and free services and it works, that's great.

Most of the time, ""you get what you pay for.""

The U.S.A. doesn't offer Universal healthcare. We pay for everything that we need if we can afford to.

And if that ability to earn an income is taken away, for good, some of us are irreparably damaged.

I feel as though I cant share my situation so that it's understood. 

I was actuall told in one of my posts,"" That's middle class thinking, you need to stop thinking that way."" 

Ex. When a person indicates they have a garnishment, no home due to income loss, and they're living on a settlement that is vanishing, they're mid age with age-related health issues (copd cough), and other non-disability related stuff...

How can anyone hire a person into a job that is temporary when it wouldnt qualify them to pay for housing &amp; buy &amp; use healthcare after satisfying a garnishment.

For some people that isnt a living wage. I know I cant forecast expenses, or pay a garnishment, housing, health care, medications, car &amp; retirement on that.

I'm not far from retirement age.

I'm just giving an example. I have a finance degree. Some people dont know where I'm at mentally, or whether I can even hold on to stay alive anymore, or if I'm on my way out for good.

People miss cues.

Good therapy involves asking the right questions versus overloading with suggestions that may work well for soms, but not for everyone.

I'm very detailed and I research the heck out if things.

Some people share tips without even checking the validity of it. ""Have you called 211?""

Why when someone is in crisis would they have lost their ability to not have tried everything reasonable BEFORE the situation resulted in a crisis.

My head is spinning with disappointment that I can't meet with or talk with the people I'd need to for help. And if I mention that any further I get admonished.

I've been blacklisted. And when that happens, no one contacts the person.

Ive moved out of State while living in my car, begging for work. 

Low hourly wasnt offered to me because I couldnt dumb my self down.

I have F mid age health issues.

It requires 8 hrs rest, nutition, exercise. 

I couldnt sleep in my car and show up to a job when there's nothing left over to cover housing, copd cough RX &amp; treatment, and other ailments that a normal white collar office job would offer more in terms of pay.",15May2019,1
29,"I just wanted to know if this is a thing? I did a quick google search and didn't quite find what I was looking for. Sometimes I get these things I've been calling ""saddness attacks"" where suddenly and seemingly unprompted I just get really sad. 

They very in strength, sometimes I just completely shutdown and need to be alone for a few hours (although granted I think I'm usually in a place where I can allow myself to just experience the emotion fully) and other times I can just sort of shake it off with a brief moment by myself. 

I dated a girl a while back who had really bad anxiety attacks and this feels like a ""saddness"" equivilant to what she appeared to be going through. Take that with a grain of salt though because obviously I don't know exactly what she was going through and we honestly never really talked about it.

34,"I'm very new to reddit, so I'm not quite sure if this is the correct community to post this to. Please bear with me.

Basically, I've had passive suicidal thoughts for the past 5 years, and I feel like it's just a part of daily life at this point. I hardly ever plan on actively killing myself, and more see suicide as a plan B if things ever go south. However, the thoughts have become more intense and frequent lately, and I have actively planned a suicide recently, though did not carry it out. I worry for my mental health in this regard, and wish to discuss these thoughts with a parent or therapist. However, in the past, I have been unwillingly admitted to a psychiatric ward for my suicidal thoughts. I couldn't stand staying there, to the point where I pretended to feel better so I could be released. That time in my life was extremely distressing, and it led to me developing an intense fear of mental institutes. On more than one occasion, I've tried to discuss my thoughts with my mother, but it always ends with her threatening to send me back if I plan to kill myself. She never lets me discuss my feelings and thoughts before immediately telling me that I will be sent back if I plan on hurting myself. She often shames me by stating that killing myself is selfish, which only worsens my mood. Because of this, I have been unable to talk about my depression or suicidal thoughts with a therapist or my parents. 

I'm not sure how to deal with this situation, as I really need help but cant stand the thought of being thrown back into a mental institute. I've been able to discuss this with my friends, but I still feel that seeing a therapist and taking medication would be beneficial to me. However, I cannot see a therapist without my parents setting it up, which would lead to threatening to send me back... You get the idea. I also worry that a therapist may misinterpret my thoughts and choose to send me to a hospital. 

Should I wait until I leave my parents home to seek help? Even if I do, is there any way I can avoid being sent to a psychiatric ward for my thoughts? I haven't been able to find any advice on this topic, so help would be much appreciated.",15May2019,2

After I arrived, I received an email informing me I’d failed my semester due to non-attendance at the exam I’d just completed. 

I'm away from my partner, stranded in a foreign country – without my support system – at a family member's funeral, and was (mistakenly) under the impression that my career was over. My EIGHTEEN despairing, misspelled emails weren't angry or offensive, but they were inappropriate.

I apologised profusely after they found my paper, but it’s too late now. The last few days, I've been non-stop weeping, and have fallen into old self-harming habits. The department head has sent me a stern telling-off, which I’ll admit was upsetting given that my stream of messages indicated significant instability, and genuinely weren’t angry. In his position, I'd have taken a ""do you need support"" line of conversation, but hey ho, life goes on.

One of my earliest memories are of me exaggerating to everyone about a cut I suffered from a scissor. I also remember hitting myself with something on the wounded region just to make sure the swelling didn't go down
I then once kept insisting for days that a slight fall I had, had lead to bad pain in my wrist even though the x-rays showed nothing until they put on a cast on my hand after which I stopped complaining. During the period I insisted on having pain I would hit my wrist with a hammer to put myself in pain 
There have been other small incidents of me exaggerating the pain that I had from small cuts and wounds
I have also once poked myself in the eye repeatedly until it was red and swollen. My parents thought I had some infection
These were all starting from ages when I was really young. 
I don't think I did anything like that after the age of 13-14 
But this is the part that makes me think that I actually have Munchausen's. I have always mildly had memories of a disturbing event that took place in my childhood. But for a while now after reading about Munchausen's I think I have made up all these memories for the sake of attention only. I don't even know if it's the truth anymore. I've been blaming an innocent person for nothing. I'm disgusting. I hate myself.
Recently I made friends I felt I could share these memories twith yet I've found it really hard to do so and I've never told them the entire memory..they just know a gist of it. I regretted telling them the moment the words left my mouth. Ive also pretended or exaggerated  to have symptoms of mental health issues only infront of them.

46,"once upon a time there was a young boy,

this boy was as average and many others.

hes wasn't particularly tall or short,

he wasn't over or underweight,

he was just that,

 just an everyday young boy with nothing special,

Except for one thing i forgot to mention

he had IT, 

now whats it you ask ?

it's one thing that whether you know it or not drives the world,

it wasn't wealth it wasn't brains it was just a little SOMETHING

that little something was a spark, 

a tiny little seemingly innocent creative spark

as the young boy grew he developed this spark into something wonderful,

it grew and grew like a thunderstorm into something truly fantastic.

it drove him to excel from a young age whether it was something little like a drawing,

to take home and be proud of to show ma and da his talent

to something like his curiosity,

 which by the time he was 6 had him sitting on his 

living room carpet taking apart anything he could find from the television remote to the proud 

grandfather clock.

as he grew older the spark developed into a truly fantastic talent

he became better and better at drawing, and making 

he learned quickly from watching and reading about what others had,

already done as he got older however the spark that drove this young boy began to wane 

it started to die out like the flash of a lightning strike 

beautiful yet in its own way fleeting, and it quickly turned

into the young mans biggest fear his creative mind

began to work against him what was once his strongest drive had became

his entry into loneliness he worked away as much as he could shutting himself away from the 

others his age, he became ''independent'' of others

he began to enjoy his own company and that of his video games 

when he hit around 16 he began to start his turn into despair

he moved out of his foster carers home and into his own

apartment where he bagan to do nothing but play online games 

and distance himself from the world.

slowly he began to spiral into desperation and sadness, wanting to be like others 

but he had been alone for so long the dark thoughts anyone would have

had spiralled out of control

they had taken over his way of thinking the young man could barely 

hold the nerve to get of of his sofa in the morning from where he slept

unable to afford a bed because his mental state had got to the point 

where his nerves couldn't hold out him working

a day to day job like other successful people his own age 

instead he sat on his own staring at the little blue screen he had grown to depend upon 

getting worse and worse and his mental health declining so fast even he knew it

wasn't right, 

now you ant to hear the funny part?

Thats me, hi im mike im a 25 year old loner who became so 

reliant on his own company he 

doesn't even know how to process a day to day life

instead he lies to his family and friends about how he is,

claiming to 'be fine' and he's 'doing great' when he isnt when he wants to flip a switch and make everything go away permanently and indefinitely.

well sorry for the anti-climatic end to our story, but that's just me 

i WAS the story and seeing how i'm writing this right now 

we both know it's not over, but i have a question for you reader,

did you make the same mistake i did or did you see where i went wrong

its funny how life likes to remind you, your not special unless you make yourself to be 

now how, i wonder do you do that, When there doesn't look to be a future for someone like you ?   
DON'T BE LIKE ME.

 talk to someone no matter how little you actually tell them just make sure you find a way to talk that works for you BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE WORDS  
P.s i used a random name and age but the rest of this story is true i really do feel like i can't do anything right and even i know i'm not ok i just can't get help i honestly dont think im worth helping when all i want is to make everything disappear it's been 5 years i have felt like honestly that IT would be the honestly easier option now and i really dont have anywhere or anyone to go to.  
 Thanks for reading, it means alot someone finally heard what i had to say after this long",15May2019,2
47,"I got a job about two months ago, my reviews from management have all been extremely good and I've even already managed to reorganized a number of administrative tasks to increase efficiency and been given responsibility for some larger projects that were originally considered above my pay grade.

Now onto the problem. I work for company that manages condos and apparently at a board meeting there was a whole conversation between the board, a number of whom I've never met, and only a single person I'd interacted with more than once, that they sent sure I'm the right person for this position. Essentially there comments were that ""she isn't happy enough, she isn't social enough, she  isn't the right personality to represent the organization"". The comments were enough that my manager passed them to me as a complaint. I know the simple answer to this is to be friendlier but I'm at my capacity for social interaction already, I'll try but I doubt anyone will see a difference. 

So my question: if I manage to make it past my probation period could they use this to fire me for cause? I'm really freaked out because I had a period of unemployment and I have no savings at all so losing this job would be catastrophic. Also how do I figure out if I qualify for EI if I'm fired?

In case anyone in wondering why I don't just be happier. I was unemployed for a while because I had a major mental health crisis that ended in an er. On a day to day basis I'm better than I used to be but I'm not great. I am also autistic so the stuff that most people do (like small talk) is extremely hard for me and as much as I try I do occasionally make people feel akward because I don't realize that the silence means I should say something or I'm not making eye contact.",15May2019,1

49,"Hello everybody. The only thing I can think about is how much I want to have lived in the medieval times and been a part of something like the crusades (ok this obviously doesn't have anything to do with me hating muslims, just an example). I know it sounds really silly and childish, but it's seriously all I think about. I can't stand the fact that I live in today's society, where rules are strict and almost everything you do is being spied on. I yearn for adventure, but not ""let's go to the grand canyon, lets go climb mt. Kilimanjaro"" like the rest of the yuppies.

I feel strength in that because I always have myself and I am never uncertain about that but around people that changes. There's talking behind your back, snide comments, bullying, aggression, and overall selfishness. Being around people is and has never been rewarding to me, its always fraught with insecurity and unhappiness. My loneliness is a strength I use to define myself from other people, everyone else needs love, companionship, and friendship and all I ever needed was myself.

52,"I don't feel like I know who I am at this point. It feels like I'm stuck in a constant cycle of feeling nothing about anything and being stuck right in the middle of a storm of emotions. It feels like I'm either apathetic to almost everything or I feel so awful I beat myself up for everything. So of course I try to relax and find anything to enjoy, only for emotions to flood back in and make me feel like I'm just a lazy piece of shit without a reason to be alive. Some times I've had delusions and paranoia so bad I've yelled at my friends over stuff that doesn't exist, and other times I've tried to scratch myself until I bled just because of how fucking stupid that was. It feels like I always look at what I do or have done and think ""Why the fuck would I ever think that's a good idea"" for everything. If I try to do art I just get mad at myself for trying to make such a difficult thing work when I know how hard and risky it is.

I knew I disconnected from my life at times and I'm trying to better understand it. I've never really talked about it before as I thought it was my fault for doing it or feeling this way. It feels like my emotions fade to nothing except for anger and sadness and I don't really care about much at all. I try to pretend it's fine or like I'm just tired so people don't worry until it goes back to ""normal"".

 I can sometimes feel disconnected from loved ones as if I don't care about them or as if they don't care About me and never did. It comes and goes making me feel like I can't trust reality or how I feel because I can't tell what's going on.

My emotional and reality eventually come back after feeling disconnected for a few days or so. It can often lead to emotional overload as all the emotions come back at once, It's mostly just sadness and guilt that it's my fault for feeling like this in the first place.

56,"I can't really express this sentiment without sounding like an edgeboy, but let me assure you that I'm being sincere.

I frequently find myself overwhelmed with a feeling of being ""othered"" by my peers and by my acquaintences as I go about my daily interactions. I can't help but feel that the way I see and think about the world is just... Different than other people's. This causes me to become very cynical, even hateful sometimes, of the general public. I try to be self aware and carry in the fore-front of my mind that I am in no way intrinsically *better* than the people around me, but then the sentiment comes full circle and I wonder how many people think about their own pride as much as I do... Which at the very least makes me feel more self aware and thus *maybe smarter? * I don't know. I definitely know it's toxic and I fight it, but I am so often disappointed by the world and I feel dwarfed by the sheer density of just... Everyone else's stupidity. I hate to be so blunt, but for the sake of actually conveying the way I feel I think it's required. The cynicism and the hate is like a demon inside of me, always telling me I'm better than everyone. Ironically, a large pillar of my persona is that I try to be as non-egotistical as possible. Perhaps this is to be expected, but the very effort of me trying to be non-egotistical has the inverse effect of me feeling superior because of it. I know I sound like an asshole, please withhold your judgements.

I feel like, metaphorically, that the strangers around me are robots and that I'm the main character on some TV show being watched by God. I can't deal with the grayscale that the world around me has become. I want to be less cynical. I want to see the vibrancy in the world that I did when I was a child. Am I wrong? Do other people feel this way?

57,"Right now, emotionally speaking, I feel really fine and I feel like I have greater control over my emotions, and I really like myself more than I used to, but I still space out a lot and it disturbs my daily life. I thought I had my dumb moments like everybody else, but it's repeating all the time and it's even more obvious when I'm stressed. 
To give some backstory on that, I've had times of depression and suicidal thoughts, and when I was little, I used to be kind of bored and unsatisfied with my life, so I learnt how to distance myself from that through disassociating, and taking different characters' personalities. Like, there were characters in games or movies that I enacted, but to a point where it became an escape from reality and forgot about myself. Like, I pretended I was that character and I wasnt myself, and that really blurred my sense of self. Thing is, now I'm 17, I've been doing it from when I was 10 to about 15 when I started high school and I really had to be more involved in my own reality. I thought I was over it, but I'm always still spacey and airy, kinda lost, can't think for myself some of the time and react very late, and I doubt it's just me being dumb (and also, I guess that thing with being other characters has still remained somehow, I feel like I have split personalities and I don't know who I am entirely) :))) and I'm not sure what to do about it. I've been to a therapist and it doesn't help, she doesn't understand me and she gave no advice, she just listened and that was about it. And I'd want to work on that myself, but I need suggestions on what could I do to sharpen my mind and to tap more into myself.",15May2019,1

Im not, i just wanna get better.

now i just finished my 2nd appointment and I told her about my anger issues related to anxiety and she basically told me i'd deal with the law for that and i have to be responsible for my problems. thats fair. then,i told her i might need a break as i cant pretend like nothings wrong and try to cope going to camp everyday and she said she JUST gave me a break. i said 'id like to put my improvement first before my service' and she said see thats the problem you put yourself first, what would this world be like if everyone put themselves first? maybe ur superiors put themselves first so they say nasty things.

59,"So there's a bit of backstory here, I'm mostly looking for people who have experience with being in this sort of situation and any recourses they might have to assist me in getting through this sudden fluxation in my confidence. 

First, I'm not a college graduate, or even a student. I attended community college for one semester at best. Though I did well in high school and got accepted into a few colleges (I didn't send out any applications, so that was weird), I had decided early on in my life that unless the world dropped at least a hundred grand unto my lap I wasn't going to waste my time with a degree. If you can't tell, that makes me American. 

The reason this is important is because I am now in a position of moderate power in a health care company. I'm middle management, which I attained with experience and by being really good at my job. My confidence in my skills is usually pretty good. Not that I am arrogant enough to think I'm perfect, I can admit when I'm wrong and that there is also room for growth. I still make stupid mistakes, and I own up to them when they happen. As a leader I believe I should be the one on the bottom of the pyramid, holding everyone else up.

This is stressful philosophy to hold. My teams mistakes become my mistakes, and their success also becomes, in my opinion, our success. Quite often I refuse praise for my work, or avoid conversations involving my achievements with others. This was fine when I was just one of team, even though I was still, back then, a person that others turned to for help and advice. 

Recently, I looked around and I realized that I had trained everyone but four people in the office. I had taught them all, including my manager. It was a startling revelation to have, and I was briefly elated. 

Naturally, that's when the doubts come in. As I said, they've been happening more often. The feeling that I've done everything wrong, that I'm going to be fired because my boss is going to find out that I have no idea what I'm doing. That the only reason why I'm here is because they pitied me, the young woman with no higher education. I know, factually, that none of this is true. 

Recently the sudden influx of doubts happened when I brought attention to our development team a flaw in one of the applications we use for training. Or, what I view as a flaw, because in my opinion it skews the data. The way that I've taught all of my employees to record data isn't supported on the new application. I understand that what they're striving for is consistency. That each employee is taught the same way and do the same things so that the data stays consistent. However, my teams way of doing things has always been more practical. I even received permission from my mentor to bring the concerns forward, because they were the one to approve of our data methods in the first place. However, I did not double check my email with them since it was the end of the work day and I was eager to send out my report and concerns. 

The email I received back isn't very important, but the gist of it is that they brought my own training up as a concern, insinuating that I need to be retaught how to do my job. 

Now, while I'm no stranger to doubts, this one isn't one I can shake, especially after the sudden increase in these feelings of inadequateness. I haven't replied to the email yet, I'm going to bring it up to my mentor tomorrow and see what I can do, but for the last four hours I've been spiraling down a rabbit hole if self doubt, thinking that maybe I should just quit my job and go somewhere else and that any one of the people that I trained could do better than me. Which, it's arrogant of me to assume they can't. 

Regardless, it's never been this bad before, and I'm worried that it's only going to get worse. 

TL;DR
I have doubts of my ability to do my job and a recent risky move brought these doubts up again, any advice to build up my self confidence when these things happen or recourse for dealing with imposter syndrome?",15May2019,1
60,"Hello! I'm not really sure if this is the right place to talk about this, but it's kind of become an issue these past few weeks.. Anyway, I've been having some odd/bad dreams.

Sometimes, they silently come into my house and follow me around. In the dreams, I'm never harmed, but it's really.. creepy.

It's just troublesome because I now can't look at the windows in my own Actual home without freaking out.

61,"WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE. - For some context, I am Asian American, a freshman in high school, second of four kids,  only boy, and have both Asian parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't get it anymore. I've been happy for the last four months or so. I'm just trying to cruise through high school and do well enough to please myself and my parents. I've been suicidal for about three years at least, and I had a stint in the hospital where I was almost institutionalized about two years ago because of my mental problems, but I was able to go home thank God. Since then, my parents have been somewhat understanding, and I see a psychologist every other week. However, I just feel super awkward talking to him, because it doesn't feel right talking to him about how I actually feel about myself, but at the same time, it is great to have someone to talk to. Even with all of that help, I still had some suicidal issues, just seven months ago I tried to kill myself via Carbon Monoxide Poisoning in the garage of our house by turning on the car and putting 5 damp rags in the exhaust and sitting in the car with all of the vents open. 

As nearly all Asians do, I'm in Kumon, and that's been a large source of my suicidal thoughts. Unlike my other three sisters, I'm not that mathematically inclined. Kumon in general has made me super smart in math, but it has taken a severe toll on my mental health. Every time I have to go, I go in the bathroom and literally have a panic attack in the bathroom for 5-10 minutes. Every time I tell my parents, they just say ""get over yourself"", and I get that a part of growing is indeed learning to get over yourself. Suffice to say, Kumon is not my favorite place and I'm pretty sure I have some minor form of PTSD from Kumon because I often dream about Kumon and it's always a really fucked up version of Kumon and being trapped and things like that. I really want to quit soon, because during Junior Year, having Kumon compacted onto me is going to make me mentally collapse, but I'm not allowed to quit until I turn 18 or until I finish all of Kumon. 

My family is also Southern Baptist, but I have so many questions. Everyone at my church is super kind, but I just fail to see how God give people who He made in ""His own Image"" things that no human should ever have to go through. Some people at church know that I have some issues, but nobody knows the extent to which I have problems. 

I know that I have so many support systems and I have no reason to feel this way. But, I do. I'm just too scared to talk to people about it because I have before, and it's always ""Suicide is selfish, don't be selfish"" and ""you have such a good life, you have no reason to feel this way"". **NO SHIT, SHERLOCK! I KNOW THAT!** And even super famous people who had it all have committed suicide before, (Anthony Bourdain, Robin Williams). I just don't have anyone who will really listen and get me the help I need. 

The way I'm thinking right now, I want either one of two things:

1. To get help without being fucking institutionalized, I just want to get help and feel happy again, may that be some form of therapy or medication, but I can't be institutionalized. 
2. To just die. I found out that my dad is a gun owner, and he has a Remington shotgun in his closet. If it comes to, I want to just end it and have some peace for once.

My sister is 13 and last Wednesday, she tried to kill herself. Ambulance came and took her to the ER and the next day they determined that she needed to go to a psychiatric hospital to their adolescent unit.

&amp;#x200B;

She's been there since. And I feel that she is not ready to discharge home on Thursday but I feel they're going to send her home anyway. She is 100 percent compliant but I feel that she is not being completely honest.

&amp;#x200B;

She's severely addicted to her phone and snapchat. We thought this was the root of all her issues but we feel that now, it may be only a symptom. We've learned since last Wednesday that she's attempted multiple times to kill herself and earlier tonight, my mom found suicide notes she wrote to her family. Myself included.

&amp;#x200B;

In mine, it said she viewed me as a second mom and that she loves me so much and she doesn't want to hurt me. But she's tired of being here.

In the one to my dad (he's not in the picture anymore), it was hateful and told him she truly believes he's going to hell. My dad is a sick person and when I moved away from home, I cut him out of my life. I haven't talked to him in years.

&amp;#x200B;

But apparently my sister is still really struggling with how she feels about him. She feels abandoned, hurt and ignored. She feels like he left her to go be with a better family.

I feel like her therapists might not be doing enough.

I feel like they are not treating anything in relation to the addiction with her phone. She keeps asking me why can't she prove to my mom that she can be responsible with SnapChat? It seems that that's all she can focus on. I'll ask her how group went earlier and then somehow the conversation circles back to what do you think will happen with her SnapChat access when she gets home?

&amp;#x200B;

I worry that although this may be a symptom of deep rooted issues, we're not doing what we should be to help her be okay without SnapChat (she will most likely never have access to this again). I feel that when she's so distraught about not using her SnapChat, she may sink back into that depth of depression to where she feels there's no way out and has not learned enough healthy coping mechanisms. She also isn't learning independent leisure skills to turn to when she does not have her phone. I wish we could keep her there longer to give her more of a break from her phone because she is so so addicted to it and at the same time keep her safe and supervised, but that is quickly coming to an end and I'm terrified.  She has ZERO hobbies. It's purely her damn phone all day every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I work and so does my mom during the day.

&amp;#x200B;

What is going to happen when she's out of school and neither one of us is available to be with her all day long? She lives in a sketchy neighborhood and goes to a school in a different city than where she lives so she has no friends around the area that she can just walk over and hang out with. It would take my mom or I driving her safely to and from these friends' houses to see them and then we worry that she would just get on SnapChat on their phones.

&amp;#x200B;

She needs adult supervision every day while my mom and I are at work but I have no idea what is out there.

Neither one of us have money to enroll her in summer camp or anything.

I feel that the hospital has not been very helpful in giving us resources or help on what to do when she discharges.

&amp;#x200B;

I just need some help. Some advice on what to do.....",15May2019,5

Teen dude in a rather strict college (job training center thing... idk). That I was lucky to get into.
Im emancipated but struggle with a whole long list of mental and physical problems but I’m getting help with the mental and some of the physical. Cool thanks. After my short life with one failure of a parent and human being I’ve lived in juvie and mental health facilities.
So why the hell is getting my junk fondled by someone who’s, to my knowledge, just a coach with no actual training in anything medical training?!
I’ve dealt with rape and extreme violence, I’ve told the people here this... now I have to be in a closed door room with someone who doesn’t know what their doing and might think I have an std (small problem with my junk but I’ve had it check and done what I can to look it up at the library, nothing serious just cosmetic I suppose) who has a reputation for being a bit well grabby?
My last chance In life and about to let it go to waste because I can’t get over being... used. No one will listen to me. He’s the only who can do it... bullshit you fucking let him do it. A few of the people here have reported him for trying to jack them off.

TL:DR do I let myself someone attempt to molest me, with my history or rape. Sure they say he won’t be pushy but he’ll sure try before he you get him to stop. Or throw my life away because I’m not comfortable with that

The whole 'let's stay home' is WHY WE'RE ALONE. I'm amazed how hard it is to construct a social life because people are so close-minded. Video games and TV literally stole my friends. That's one thing therapy can never solve. So long as we're lazy and not reaching out to others, or respond when others reach to us, we just keep spreading the loneliness epidemic which is incredibly dangerous.

Put concisely I'm struggling with feelings of low self worth and directionless-ness. These bad feelings are manifesting in anxiety and depression and alienating me from my coworkers.

83,"First of all, I hope I'm in the right sub (I apologize if I'm not).
So I have this problem: I daydream too much. My whole life (I'm adult now) I've been here phisically but never HERE mentally, if you know what I mean. My head is in the clouds, all the time, for my whole life. This has been a problem academically for lack of concentration and in relationship with other people as well, as I tend to get lost in my thoughts.
The 'CPU' is my brain and it gets overloaded when the external and internal inputs are way too much to handle, making me sweat, get hot and red in the face. Still, I cannot stop daydreaming even tho I should focus on external things that are more important, I should prioritize them first.
Any idea on how to solve this is appreciated... Thank y'all.",15May2019,2
84,"So I'm not really sure how to start this, but I have to post it somewhere because I feel like publicly admitting that I'm improving, and recovery is not only possible but working, will help me feel like it's true. 

I have borderline personality disorder and it stole my teenage years from me. I hated myself, I was suicidal, and I spent years wasting my potential and engaging in risky behaviours just to feel something, anything that wasn't the hopelessness that followed me wherever I went. 

In a few months I'll be 21, and that terrifies me; I'm still trying to learn how to be a functional person... I guess I just didn't picture myself starting my 20's this way. 

But today I did a heap of laundry and I changed my bedsheets so that I can finally stop breaking out from sleeping in them. It doesn't sound like a lot, I know, I wanted to get a lot more done so I kinda beat myself up about that, but it's ok. Something is better than nothing. I wasn't even capable of doing this a year ago. I would have just burst into tears and then stayed in bed for days, and still not actually get it done. So, this is good. This is progress. This is recovery.

85,"Hi. I struggle with generalized anxiety and panic attacks. I currently take nothing for these issues because I can normally manage them except for the occasional irrational panic attack. 

Anyways, I am wondering if the following ‘symptoms’ happens to anybody else when they’re going through times of extreme stress. 

When I am going through something that I would consider a time of extreme stress (Ex: a really hard test in college I was nervous for or a big deadline at work) I start waking up in the middle of the night, and in a very delusional sleepy state will compare my situation to the current TV show I am watching. 

For example, I have a new project at work with a big deadline this Friday. I find myself as I fall asleep, wake up, or in the middle of the night comparing my current software project to Game of Thrones???? Like totally irrational connections. Like I need a bunch of missing data to complete part of the project, so in my sleepy delusional state I go through whole scenarios of how we sword fight to get master data or what not. It’s irrational and makes no sense. 

At no point during these delusions am I not in control of my thoughts though, like I know every time that this is not reality and I am just being weird and making connections that aren’t there. Like I know that those thoughts are totally made up in my mind. Yet while I sleep and try to sleep, it’s all I can think about even though it doesn’t make sense.

So like what the hell. Is this normal??? What do I do?",15May2019,1
86,"I've recently been diagnosed with PTSD and and adjustment disorder and have been under almost constant ""care,"" but there's something going on with me that actually bothers me much more than the stuff the therapist and physicians seem to be focused on. It's this constant feeling of whatever I'm doing, I've already done once in the past even though I know there's not actual memories I could have that are simply relatable.  This extends to more than just situations though.. It's a frequent occurrence lately with things even as basic as speaking a sentence in conversation. I get a sharp pang of embarrassment as if I had repeated something I said earlier verbatim, but every person I've asked has assured me that's not actually the case.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first brought this up, I was given an anticonvulsant medication, but with no change after a few days I was taken off and the physician seems to have written off the symptom entirely. Does anybody have some insight into what this could be? I've been reading myself, and it seems most commonly to be a type of ""aura"" that foreshadows an epileptic fit. But at this point, I would almost be relieved if that seizure just happened already.

Thanks for your time.",15May2019,1

For people who suffer from anxiety and/or nervousness and/or are socially awkward:

&amp;#x200B;

So, you are awkward.

So what? It's okay.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

However it is, it is okay. Nobody cares. Doesn't matter that much. People don't mind.

&amp;#x200B;

So, you feel, you come off as anxious or nervous or awkward, maybe not that confident. Maybe you struggle a little, or stutter a little.

So what? It's okay.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Nobody cares. People don't really care. They think about it for maybe half a sec and then forget. They don't mind. you worry about it more than anybody else. Maybe you can't help worrying and agonizing about it. And that's okay too. It's okay. But, even knowing this mentally/ logically/ conceptually, helps. It soothes you. Relaxes you a little.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you said too little or too much. Maybe you repeated yourself.

So what? It's okay. Nobody cares. Chill.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever seen a character in a movie or tv show who was awkward/nervous/anxious or something along those lines? What did you think of their awkwardness/ anxiety/ nervousness? What did the other characters think of it?

**Not much.**

Nobody cares that much. You maybe thought about it for half a sec and then forgot. Whatever. Doesn't matter.

It is similar in real life and for real people. It's okay. Nobody cares that much. People don't mind.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

&amp;#x200B;

**I suffer from anxiety and brain fog. i have become quite socially awkward and nervous in recent years. But I found:**

1. Saying ''Thank you'' is okay and enough.
2. If you can, Try to agree and affirm rather than argue. (Say Yeah, True. or Nod). If you couldn't, that's okay too. you can try again, from now on. Little by little, you will catch up.
3. Saying ''Okay'', ''I see'', ''You are right'', ''True'', ''Good point, ''Yeah'' or nodding are good ways to agree, good ways to do your part in a conversation, good ways to end a conversation. They are perfectly acceptable. You come off as more amiable, friendlier too.
4. If you can't think of anything to say, say nothing. It is okay. It is okay to say nothing. The world is noisy enough.
5. If you have trouble finding the right words, but you can't. If you are struggling to organize your thoughts or say the right, perfect thing, give the right answer, but you are not able to, then, say what you can, what comes to you, however it comes to you, in whatever way and order it comes to you. That's fine. That works, too. It is acceptable. It's okay.
6. When you feel this nervous or anxious urge to say something when someone is talking to you, you don't necessarily have to act on it.. If you can, listen, nod and agree. That is being a good listener. Besides, if you are anxious/ awkward, you will maybe say something and then agonize over what you said, in your head, later. However, if you couldn't help it and said something, that's okay too. Maybe, you said the right thing. Maybe you were right.
7. If you said too much, or something weird, stuttered, argued, interrupted, maybe repeated yourself, so what? it's okay. It happens. It is life. it is a small thing. very small thing.
8. However it goes, it is okay. People don't care that much. However it went, it's okay. Nobody minds.
9. It is okay to be yourself, at this moment, however you are. You are allowed to accept yourself, the way you are, right now. Take a deep breath. Relax. It's okay. Try it for a small period of time. See what happens.
10.  Often, it is more okay to be our awkward, nervous, anxious self than we allow ourselves to be. Little by little, let yourself go. Let it be. It is okay to be awkward. You are allowed to relax. You are allowed to accept yourself.
11.  Maybe it is a phase. Maybe things will change, someday, somehow. Maybe, little by little. It is life. It is okay.
12.  It is okay to be who you are, at this moment, for a day, for a little while. Relax. Accept it, internally. Let it be. Don't constantly fight it or resist it or change it. Be who you are, how you are, for now. it is okay. Accept it, in your mind, at least. Relax. Breathe.
13.  Try meditation. 15 minutes a day is enough. 5 minutes is okay. 3 minutes. Breathing meditation. If you can do it for an hour, great. It helps with anxiety, brain fog, lots of mental issues and even physical issues. If you can, do it regularly. Ideally, 15 minutes in the morning, right after you wake up, and 15 minutes before bed. Or, whenever you can. It works. It helps.

These are little things. But for people who are awkward and/or suffer from anxiety or nervousness, they can make a huge difference.",15May2019,1
88,"Background: 30/F, history of childhood abuse, bipolar ii, ADHD-PI, hypothyroidism &amp; PCOS. I’ve been seeing my therapist for about 3 weeks, so we are just starting to get to know each other. I described a situation to her where I had every right to be angry, but the entire night I could not rein my anger in for the life of me. At the end of the night, after everyone went their separate ways, I blocked 2 family members (this was a family gathering) from my phone &amp; social media. After a day or so I regretted it because I see now that it was just retaliation &amp; passive aggressive behavior. What they said to me was not ok at all (comments about my weight, lying that it was just a joke, trying to shut me up when I said that wasn’t ok). However cutting them off was just my way to get back at them and hurt them like they hurt me. 
Anyway. I need to explain this to my therapist in a way she will understand. She sees red flags all the time because I have SHITTY self esteem. When I bring this kind of thing up, she just tells me not to blame myself and tells me my feelings are ok, and I’m justified, I’m allowed to feel this way, so on and so forth. How can I ask for help?",15May2019,1

90,"Was sleeping wonderfully, suddenly I'm awake. I cant go back to sleep. My mind is worried. I just started antidepressants about a month ago. I've noticed that I feel better but I'm still not always thinking clearly.
I have emotional issues, anger issues.
The thing is I put in my two weeks in a fit of rage and frustration with being overworked, alone, short handed, nagged and unappreciated. I have despite all this an amazing work ethic - If theres one thing that helps my mental illness it's my focus on doing a job well done.
I learn quick, anything and I'll learn it. The issue is I've always worked in social services helping others. Though theres a satisfaction in feeling like I really helped someone the pay is always very small. I want to get paid more. I'm older and I'm still getting paid less than my 20 year old counterparts and it makes me feel inadequate.
I have references up the wazoo.
Other issue is I'm tired of the 9-5. I want to be my own boss, or find a position that does not involve ""customer service"" I need a break from that type of daily interaction.
Idk if this is the right place for this.
I need to get therapy help which will start on Monday, and I want to go into computers, right now billing and coding and writing books. 
I feel like a failure because theres so much I want to do but cant seem to decide on the order, or the priority.
I want to take this opportunity of not working to get certified in something that will raise my income drastically so I can move where I please.
Again idk if this is the right place for this. I just woke up in a sweat of worry ""wtf am I going to do or apply for?!"" And now I cant stop worrying...any advice would be appreciative. 
Also I'd love a remote job, something simple even part time that will allow me to study while still bringing in some income....
I'll remove post if not the right place. Thanks.",15May2019,1
91,"I feel nothing right now. I woke up and I was shaking. It kept going. I was happy though. Now I just feel nothing. I feel plain and boring. I’m not happy. I just feel dull. What could bring me joy? I don’t know. I just want to feel something. Why don’t I feel anything? Depression I guess. I’m tired of it right now. Life yeah. But I don’t know. I want things to get better because I know it can. I just don’t know how to get better. I want to be happy. Life seems to be falling apart right now. I’m worthless. I can’t even bond with my daughter. I just want us to have a bond. That’s all. I want to have a purpose in life. I don’t want to just sit around all day and do nothing. But that’s the only way I feel like I can live. I don’t know how to do anything. I’m afraid of leaving home for a couple of hours. I need to see my therapist. This just isn’t normal. I’m going to call today I hope. I need to force myself to go and make an appointment. I hope I can be seen today. I need help managing my emotions. It’s very difficult. I don’t know why I feel this way. It just hit me like a ton of bricks. I was ok when I woke up aside from the anxiety. But now, nothing. I feel nothing. Why am I like this right now? I don’t remember the last time I felt this emotionless. Is that the right word for what I’m feeling? No it’s numb. I feel numb. I can hear the room around me. It’s like an ocean of whispers. It’s static. But I can hear the pulse of my heartbeat. I need to write out my sensors. I think that’s the right word. Is it? Maybe not. Sight. Smell. Sound. Touch. Taste.

I see my room. And my phone right in front of me. The shadows are there. But I’m not afraid. There’s nobody in here except me and my mind. The curtain is sticking out a bit. That reminds me that the window is there. What if I’m not alone. What if I just can’t see them there.

Smell. One side of my nose is clogged. It smells like an old house maybe. The air around my nose is cold.

Sound. I told you what I hear. It’s still there. It’s like a burglar alarm in the distance. But very hazy. I hear a rooster crow. And birds chirp. But the sound of nothing is there. The sound of nothing is different than hearing nothing.

Touch. My toes are cold. And my neck is kinda itchy. My phone is in my hands.

Taste. Bitter almost. But there’s something in my throat. A lump maybe. I feel like I could puke but not really. I’m not nauseous. 

I’m afraid. Why am I afraid. I hear her crying. It scares me. I’m running away from my responsibilities but am I really. I’m just weak. I’m too weak. I’m not a mother. I gave birth to her. But I’m not a mother. I don’t deserve that recognition. She deserves better than me. She needs a good mom. My mom is doing a good job. I just wish I didn’t give birth to her. I wish my mom did. That way she could have a good biological mom. It’s 5:30am right now. I should be the one holding her and giving her her morning bottle. But I’m not. I’m lazy and irresponsible. I can’t even force myself to do those things. Why can’t I. Even if it’s pure torture I should force myself. But I don’t want to hurt. I don’t want to hurt her. I want to have a bond with her. I want to be a mom to her. But I’ll never make it. How can I fake it. I already do. IM NOT OKAY. I need to realize that. I always feel like I’m faking the way I feel. But I’m not. I’m not. I’m not. But I’m okay. I promise. I always say. I’m not okay. I promise. No no no. I’ll always lie. I don’t want anybody knowing the deep secrets I hold inside. They would fear me. I fear myself. I’m afraid of myself. I’m afraid of my mind. I think I’m having another episode of psychosis again. But I’m not. The last time it happened I was faking. I had to be. It was only a one time thing. Why didn’t it happen again. Why doesn’t it happen more often. Okay then. Case closed. I was faking. It seemed real to me in the moment but I know it wasn’t. It couldn’t have been. Real people have real issues with that. Mine wasn’t like that. It was a real issue in the moment but it’s not. Maybe I just wanted attention. Did I want attention?? Do I want attention? No. Yes. Maybe. It’s a simple question but I can’t find the answer to it. I want people to know I’m normal I’m okay but I know deep down that I’m not normal and I’m not okay. It’s all an illusion. Life is an illusion. Why can’t I make the illusion my own? It’s always got to be something bad. It can never be good. I’ll never be good. I’m addicted to the pain I put myself in. Not psychically but mentally. Am I? I’m not crazy. I just see things for what it is. And right now I’m seeing that life isn’t real. No it’s just a joke. It’s all a big joke. I hear stomping. No it’s not it can’t be. It’s just a car going down the road. But it shouldn’t sound like that. The birds are getting louder and they won’t shut up. I don’t want to hear them chirp. The fan is facing towards me like it’s judging me. The fan and the trash. Just my big failures. It’s right next to it. Almost like I can hear its thoughts. It’s saying look at the trash. You can’t even take that out. No I can’t. And it’s not real. It’s not real. It’s not real. Am I real? Yes. I’m real. But my imagination is not. I should write more often. Ha! Instead of a way to feel better about myself it’ll make me feel worse when I read it again. Because I’m faking it. I am. I’ll feel better in a little while and I’ll laugh at all of this. I already am. Hahahahaahahaha!!!! I’m so stupid. Lol I’m stupid. The fan judging me? Who in their right mind would write that??? Oh right, me. Cause I’m a joke. I’m stupid. I think things that aren’t logical.

I’m afraid. What if I can’t see my therapist today? Will I remember how I felt and who I am? Of course not. I’m flawed. Nobody believes me. Why should they? I don’t even believe myself. I need someone. ANYONE. I need someone to tell me what’s wrong with me. I need someone to make it all better. But there’s things that nobody knows. There’s things that I tell one person but not another. Why do I trust certain people with certain things? 

I guess I’m scared of how they feel about me. 5:43am. I guess I’ll write the time down to show how rapidly I decline. Or what’s the opposite of decline? Go up? I’m just writing what’s on my mind right now. Purple. Unicorn. Popcorn. Random thoughts. I hear the can drink beside me popping. It’s loud. I haven’t drank it in a little bit. It’s just making noises. I need to sleep. But I’m not sleepy. Why do I feel this way? Why why why why why why why????????????? WHY? This isn’t right. Oh boy no this isn’t right. I’m cold and I’m not comfortable. I shouldn’t be cold. I need to take a bath. A real bath. I can’t even wash my hair anymore. How funny. I just want to sit in there and think and think about all my problems and how they’ll never be solved. I wish I could peel my skin off. Maybe there’s a layer underneath that is better than me. But that’s vanity. It’s not in how I look. It’s my brain that’s messed up. Why is it messed up. Why why why??? Maybe I should make a video of how I feel. I think I might. But right now I just want to write. I need to write out how I feel. I need to write. I have to write. But why but why. I keep asking myself why. I feel sick again. But I’m not nauseous. I feel like I’m starting to get frustrated with myself. My fingers aren’t typing fast enough to write out everything I’m thinking. I’m itching. Why am I itching. That drink won’t shut up. It keeps popping and popping. It’s too much it’s too loud but it’s not loud at all it’s actually quiet but why can I hear it like it’s there. It won’t leave me alone. I need to see my therapist today. 

It’ll be the same as every other mind doctor appointment. I’ll act normal and I’ll be screaming inside the whole time. I’ll tell them how I feel. But I’m sure they think of me as a joke. How can I act so normal in front of them but FEEL SO WRONG. GO AWAY GO AWAY. No it won’t go away. Make it go away. I want to escape my skin. Just crawl out and go away. But that’s not logical. No no you only get one skin. One life one mind. I wonder what people would think of me if they read this. I think I’m going to go now. If not I’ll write more in a minute.

93,"I’m a 21 year old Male discovering a lot about myself and the way the world works right now. I’m just writing this off to help get this off my chest and to change for the better. I feel like the revelation that maybe I wasn’t as mentally healthy as I thought I was started when I got into my first relationship 2 years ago. I’ve been with the same man ever since and he’s showed me a lot f new things and has also changed my thinking a lot as well most definitely for the better. Lately I’ve been feeling as though I’m not enough for him though. Firstly I feel as though I’m financially incapable of being able to keep up with his lifestyle and I miss out on a lot of things he likes to do. Second off I’ve felt like I’ve been unable to “Satisfy” him as well and it feels bad that I can’t. I’ve felt like my drive is severely impaired compared to most only truly being in the mood for such activities maybe once or twice a month. My emotions sometimes feel irrational and lots of new feelings have emerged that I’ve never expletives before. But as a young adult I feel emotionally underdeveloped from simply never doing anything. I was always a shut in kid and had never been in a relationship let alone one that has turned out to be as joyous and wonderful as this. I think I’m just honestly looking for answers to grow more and feel capable. Being so lost in new feelings only snowballing into over thinking (where you know things just get silly.) im unsure of what im truly looking for here. Maybe insight from outside perspectives or advice on how to healthy coup with these emotions and maybe discuss these with my significant other? 

Sorry if this post these a little all over the place I’ve been quite all over the place and it’s been hard to keep a steady train of thoughts going. Also if you made it to the end thank you! :D hi, how are you? Good to see you down here too",15May2019,3
94,"I 16 m think I suffer from from a mental illness but I'm not sure/ too doubtful to accept that, confront somebody about it or get help.

(Backstory in case that matters): for the longest time I thought of myself as a really happy individual and the thought of ever being sad seemed very far fetched. That believe of genuein happiness turned into ""Well I'm not exactly happy but also not sad and I enjoy the things I like"". Later that turned into ""Wow all these memes about wanting to kill oneself are oddly relatable"" and after that, now, I think more often, more critically whether this is all worth it and if there is any benefit to living compared to just being dead. It generally comes down to the obvious of not having to worry about thoughts like this when being dead but at the same time I don't want to put the burden of killing myself onto the few people that love me, that being my family.

 Talking to myself has helped me realise and accept impostant facts in my life like e.g. I hate bothering people with anything, like when I was younger and I felt really bad, I'd just brush it off and not tell anyone. That is the reason I don't talk a lot in general (I guess I'm that quiet kid in school) and especially don't open up to people. 

More recently I started having more moments where, for a moment, I'll start to think about these things of whether this is worth it more and get really worrying thoughts. I am having one these moments right now which motivated to write this post. I want to add that all of this might be due to me having been of school for a couple months now due to an accident that mackes me unable to sit (I got an abscess removed if anyone cares). Because of that I had a lot of freetime playing mainly videogames as it's hard to do other things I enjoy such as drawing or playing an Instrument while not being allowed to sit.

(I dont know how to title this segment, I guess it's about me as a person): For the longest time, and still I am sure that I'm definetly a more introverted person and that I'm very socially awkward simply because I liked to label myself as these things. I am the most happy when people show an interest in me or my opinions. sadly however, I've experienced that with only one person so far who I had very nice conversation with and shared a lot of my ideas and opinions. In my class where (for the record, I am in my last semester now and likely won't be seeing any of them any time soon, besides during finals) I don't really have any friends, I don't really have a problem with anyone but the 3 good friends I had all moved school, leaving me to really only talk to anyone in my class when they need to copy my English homework (I am german if that matters). My parents divorced when I was 10-ish. My sister is mainly at my mums place and often comes over during the weekend. I don't really have a lot of contact to my mother unfortunately despite her living in the very small town I live in. I do see her more often now due to my condition and me moving to another city very soon to visit a school where I also hope to find like-minded people. I currently live with my dad and I love him a lot. He always raised me more as a brother than a son which is a fantastic way of raising a kid in my opinion. He smokes and drinks quite a bit but it has never caused any real harm so I don't mind.

(Moving onto what I talked about in the title): The word ""Anxiety"" and ""Depression"" have been thrown around a lot recently. And due to that I hate to even say that I'm sad, let alone anxious or depressed because I'm probably not and just exaggerating. Besides, I don't have any actual symptons I can describe except for what I'm feeling right now and a constant state of sadness. I don't have anyone to actually talk about this to. I've been trying to hide this negetive side of mine as much as possible but when I didn't, I secretly hoped someone would care. I don't want to talk to any of the common people (+ I don't have a girlfriend who I'd probably be willing to talk to) to talk about this to because of the problem I mentioned that I don't want to bother people i.e. I'm worried they'll get too worried about me or ignore it. I'd say the things that are keeping me alive right now are 1. A fear of the commitment, 2. not wanting to burden my loved ones and 3. and this might sound silly, no access to a quick and easy suicide method. The last option to get help I see is talking to a professional or random people on the Internet (which I'm doing right now) but 1. I don't believe I have actual problems, 2. It would be equally as hard to open up, 3. It costs money and I'm afraid, too much, and 4. If I did that, my family would find out and get worried.

I might delete this post sooner or later because the mentioned doubt problem and the fact that I'd hate to much attention, If anyone has any advice, tips or easy suicide methods, hook me up. And If you just enjoyed reading my post that probably would mean even more to me. Lastly, sorry for grammar, tried my best, sorta.",15May2019,1
95,"My name is Nina. I am 13 years old, and I go to 7th grade in elementary school. I'm not a very decent student, and I don't like it. I live in a family that is a little bit chaotic. I have a sister who has autism, a slightly severe form of it. My mom has health problems, and my dad is usually at work all day. Mom pays attention to my younger autistic sister, and I mainly sit in my room all day. I feel neglected sometimes, but I know I'm just overreacting. My mom is pretty neurotic and whenever I ask something of her, she replies bitterly. It hurts me sometime. I spend all day in my room, playing video games on console, pc or anything. I watch movies, TV shows. I do study, but when I do, I just can't seem to focus. Anyway, what I want to say in this little post is, I have cannibalistic urges. I like eating my own skin, I find it oddly delicious and it seems to satisfy my hunger, but these past years I've been feeling more desire for human flesh, I feel almost desperate. I feel the urge to hunt down and attack someone, and then just eat them. Raw or cooked, I never seemed to mind - I just wanted human meat. I know It's wrong. I've talked to my mother about it this way: 

""Mom, I have these... odd, savage urges to bite, hunt down and eat people,"" 

Yet her only answer was, 

""If you do that, you'll suffer the consequences,"" 

Her answer was so careless and it seemed so weird that she didn't care at all. She didn't believe me, because nowadays, girls my age fake mental illnesses and try to get attention with them. I've read many articles about how to talk to your parents about your problems, but I never again seemed to find the strength to talk to them about it. 

Once, my dad bandaged my whole hands so I wouldn't be able to eat them. I was very desperate and I didn't seem to process things as fast and I seemed to be in panic, as my friends said. I can't talk to anyone. I'm scared of being neglected, or worse, being accused of faking my hunger for human flesh, which, I think my mother already did accuse me of. I like horror movies a lot, and I like The Silence of the Lambs. My mom probably thinks I'm just trying to be like Doctor Lecter - but I'm really not. I'm really having problems. Can someone please give me some advice?

96,"I fall asleep, it's night, it's always night; there are no fantasy elements, nothing too bizarre, I am usually back to my home country; very pissed up for that matters, to the place where I spent the worst times in my life, and I have to struggle there.

There's nothing crazy, any sign of it being a dream and I would realize it being a dream; my brain constantly watches for logical inconsistencies while it seems that the other side constantly tries to make it seem real to avoid me waking up; and while that would be ok on its own, the dreams are so dark and so fucked up. They tend to be bloody, gorey, pack filled with violence, and that pisses me off, it doesn't scare me, it just pisses me up.

And the thing is that I am not scared, I always keep my head cool; in fact I am usually the threat, not the threatened, or just an spectator; so I am not in panic, but still they are uncomfortable dreams, things like catching a home intruder and torturing him, going back to college and carrying a weapon all the way and threatening everyone all the way, a mass murder event where people fight for food where I am just an spectator, or just losing my mind.

Of course the resemblance with real life is striking, and that's the thing, it's just exaggerated real life; catching a robber and torturing him, I did catch one once in my home country and a bunch of people completely destroyed him; going to college carrying a weapon, well that was a necessity; people fighting for food, oh that was every day; losing my mind, the history of schizophrenia in my family (like my aunt which I lived with all my youth, she is a lovely woman, :/ it's sad...) makes me fear I'd eventually lose my mind; but it hasn't happened and I reached critical age, so I am probably clear.

It's like my subconscious side tried to exploit my fears every time, by exaggerating old reality; exaggerating it enough that it is just borderline unreal, but not yet unbelievable. Things like falling, being chased, monsters, that shit doesn't work with me; monsters would make me say immediately ""I'm dreaming"", being chased, that wouldn't end up well for whoever is chasing me, and falling, for some reason I just keep my cool and land safely; then realize, well this is a fucking dream, I am intact, there's no pain.

But what am I supposed to do?... there's nothing I can do, it seems I'll be haunted by these dreams for the rest of my life; and what am I supposed to do?... the dreams are not ""scary"", they are just shit, they are just a struggle... not wanting to be in my home country, that is reasonable; and the dreams not being scary, well I am like that irl too; I didn't survive my home country by being emotional; I assume for everyone else, they'd piss their pants, for me, it's just annoying, having to deal with the same kind of shit as before, but exponentially worse.

The only thing that can help are outside the scope of therapy, and more in the scope of the law and money; like a permanent residency, citizenship, money to buy protection for my mother who is left behind, or whatnot, but hey such is life; so I have to work harder than these fucking ""I have everything"" depressed kids (sorry but it pisses me out), who have everything, but cannot seem to grasp it; my only option is to make a business, because that means power, meanwhile immigration bites my ass; yeah maybe those dreams are encouragement, yeah that's right, it is encouragement, not to stray from my objective, not to become a complacent 8-4 worker and watch the things I care of go to hell, let migration keep biting my ass, yeah, it's encouragement.",15May2019,1
97,"I don't know how other people can deal with such intense emotions. It's like they're breaking me, they're shattering me inside. It's painful and I honestly don't know how else to deal with it. I have gender dysphoria, which is hard enough to deal with, but when someone close to me starts talking about gender or sexuality I feel this deep deep shame and discomfort. I start sweating and my heart is racing and I just want to ESCAPE. When I hear my family or other people complaining that there's too many LGBT people and that they're disgusting I feel the strong urge to hurt myself, to disappear, to remove myself from this world. I can't show any of it. I wish they were more serious what they say that, because then they shouldn't mind if I died. I can't bring myself to care about other mental health issues. Anxiety is ruining my life, but it's a life I don't care enough. I can't even care enough about my own suffering. I'm laughing at my own anxiety attacks and breakdowns and then my chest cramps up even more and it becomes more painful and I'm escalating it on purpose in hope to ""harden up"" and prove myself that it can't kill me, or maybe to see if it actually can. I tried over a dozen medications and several therapists, but none of them can change how deeply and inherently broken I feel. Life feels terrifying and crushing and soul-shattering. Depression feels like a good friend and paradoxically helps? It tells me ""You're just a mistake that the universe will fix, don't worry"". Things don't *feel so wrong* anymore. When I try to think of myself as a real human I panic and I can't deal with the emotions.

100,"Hypersexuality and depression

It would appear the two go hand in hand for me. It has become distressing over the past few years as I have linked them together. Sex is something that makes me feel better. It stimulates me like nothing else can. My mind always ends up thinking about sex when I'm depressed. 

I never feel normal with sex. I feel like I am a weirdo, like I am dirty or a pervert. I've never felt like my libido was normal, it's always been crazy high, this worries me and repulses me. It's not that I have bad or strange tastes, it's just that I feel like it's always there in my head. 

It's almost as if talking about sex calms me down. It stimulates my mind and releases those feel good chemicals which combat my depressive feelings. There isn't anyone I can regularly talk to about it, thats something that gets to me and makes me feel really alone with it.

Consequently, this fear and insecurity has contributed greatly to the demise of the best relationship I’ve been a part of so far. I find it happening with friends as well. I haven’t made any new friends in years and I don’t want to get into another relationship until I have a better handle on it.

103,"This has all been the case ever since a very young age, for as long as I can remember, but I can't go to a health professional at the moment (reason why will be explained later on) so I decided to ask some people on here.

To put it overly simplified, I was raised in a household full of physical and verbal abuse. I was raised in a household where any form of protest would result in getting smacked at full force by my mom, followed up by a 15 minute speech about how egocentric, spoiled and terrible I was. It wasn’t just a smack against my head or across my face, this was only when I would dare to raise my voice a little at a wrong time. If I actually rebelled, lied or did something else similar, things would more often than not go as far as her dragging me across the room by my hair, kicking me, throwing heavy objects at me, repeatedly smacking me on the head so hard I legit got a headache. I had an adopted sister, who suffered from various cluster B personality disorders. She was a narcissist and psychopath, sure, but the abuse she had to endure from my mom too was unbelievable as well. My mother even involved me and my sister in it and forced us to join in on the abuse and bullying. I always felt uncomfortable doing so but if I resisted, she would give me that mean, bullying, grinning look that technically read “Don’t you think less of her too? Don’t you think she deserves this?” On top of all this, I was lonely and continuously picked on in primary school and in high school I was severely bullied while the abuse at home only got worse and worse. 

Ever since a very young age, I felt like something was off regarding the way my brain worked and the inner voice that supposedly everyone had. Mine, however, had her own identity; a name, an age, very strong opinions, hobbies, views... I figured this was normal and wrote it off as an imaginary friend. Which I, in all honesty, could use. So I fed it, I gave it attention, I communicated. When I was around 8 years old, I made a friend at school whose fantasy was all over the place. She had an imaginary friend she called Karin and she claimed it was the same one I had. We went on imaginary trips and gave it more attention than we should have. Due to my situation at home being nothing but abuse, the most I did was either sit in my room or be over at this new friend's place, while we went on these imaginary trips. My inner voice/imaginary friend liked this new name and gladly adopted it.

Then after about a year, I wanted to tell my friend about some new things that happened with ""Karin"", but out of nowhere she gave me a cold shoulder and told me she wanted to stop these games and that we had become too old for this. Games? It wasn't a game for me. This voice was real, it existed. It told me what to say and what to do, it gave me advice when I was in distress, it made choices for me. It had the ability to communicate like a human being, it had human emotions, could get mad at me, sad, happy, everything. Why would my friend think this was a game?

Fast forward a few years, I must have been around 13 and I was noticing how my mind was still playing these ""games"" and I wanted nothing for it to just stop. After all, I agreed with my friend. I had become too old for imaginary friends, but the voice just got angry and told me she was valid and had as much right of existing as I did, it was supposedly her body too. I spent days on Google trying to figure out whether this was normal, and apparently it was. ""Inner voices can be confused easily for real ones"", a Quora forum stated. I was relieved, thought nothing of it and moved on.

Until after quite some time, when I was around 14/15, I started noticing something strange. There was a new ""voice"" present. Her name was Anna and she was a fragile and often sad girl with a fairly high pitched voice; a type I hadn’t heard before. Great, I thought, another uncalled-for imaginary friend I did not even create. She and the other voice argued a lot inside my head and sometimes it drove me nuts. One of them would tell me “go tell your mom to fuck off already” while the other told me to always be respectful towards my parents and that I couldn’t do that. I once again brushed it off, this time as some anger-devil scenario going on inside my head.

But in the same year, when we were on holiday, weirder stuff started to happen. The voices actually started to come out a little and were now actually influencing my thoughts. There were these pants that I liked a lot, but then one day I just absolutely hated them. My mom wanted me to put them on because otherwise it would be a waste but Anna was just nagging me inside my head and eventually I could no longer make up who was her and who was me and I started a crying toddler tantrum at age fucking 15 over trousers. Another time I can remember was that same week being in the car, not being able to beat this high pitch out of my voice. Then, also in that same week, I was lying in bed and another voice came forward who was supposedly called Zero. That one was hateful, nothing but envy, jealousy, rage, hate. She was like a polar of Karin and she wanted nothing but me offing myself and would drive me crazy for hours until she was just gone, just like that. One night I was lying in bed and I could feel myself going crazy. I was lying in bed with my hands grabbing my head while losing my shit for hours straight, whispering things that I’ve now forgotten.

Slowly but surely, all of this disappeared except like the main inner voice and I actually forgot about it. Until a few years ago, where it happened again. Now anything up until those paragraphs above are past. Neither of them are still present, but whoever I’m about to mention is. Anyway, last year or so, I was out by myself in my town’s center when all of the sudden I felt like a switch going on inside my head. The only thing I remember between that period and snapping back, is running back and forth between stores searching for a notebook and pen, while the present new voice was muttering and complaining about it being expensive. I know it had been a fair couple of hours until I kind of “snapped back” into my own state while sitting on a bench in the center with a notebook in hand (which was empty). There was no complete amnesia going on, but it was blurry and did not feel like me at all. This happened a couple more times until she also started to become communicative inside my head. This “girl”, apparently going by Fries is some strictly Catholic girl who claims to have been around since the start and was the cause of me being so highly religious as a small child. Not sure what to think of this claim, but alright. Now the most remarkable and worrying thing is how extremely diverse all these different voices are, the fact that this girl calls herself Catholic despite me, as a person, knowing jack shit about Catholicism. There have been quite some conflicts on political and religious fronts between these voices, Karin being atheistic while Fries loves ranting about how 80% of my country is going to hell for turning their backs to God and refusing to return to what we once used to be.

While the others have had a solid physical representation inside my head, Fries really does not really aside from what she sometimes shares. Then, as if 5+ hadn’t been enough, another girl showed up called Max. She’s a foreign looking girl, tanned skin and dark curly hair, who is fairly rebellious with a love for creepy shit.

Now, my guess is that due to being lonely, abused, neglected and isolated as a kid, I felt the need to make up imaginary friends, and my brain has made it a habit. It’s now become part of how my brain works. I never bothered to tell anyone, since they would just write me off as crazy and would put me in a fucking mental hospital or something. But it’s doable. I can live this way. Hell, I could even live with this bottled up inside me for the rest of my life if I had to. Either way, there is nothing I can do now. I can’t tell anyone in real life either. My mom already treats me like a special patient for having ADD, let alone if it were something more serious. Does anyone know what this could be?",15May2019,0

105," 

I am 19 y.o. I always struggled in primary school in terms of being laughed at, not being treaten seriously **(** even today I often get mad in some situations thinking Im not being treaten seriously) etc. cuz I've been very shy, quiet thus bullied person ( just saying in case this would matter). After primary school I didnt experience such bullying anymore.

Being free of school bullying I had hard over 3years ( starting when I was 14/15) living in a family with an alcoholic father( sounds like a fcking swap with that school bullying ). My father never approved me and he was always cold to me so when he started to fall in his addiction our relationship changed from bad to even worse. Because of qualities I mentioned I have hard time making relationships. My self confidence / self-esteem are extremely low. I also have great ambitions through which I rarely enjoy the ""sucesses"" that I should be enjoying ( never good enough). Sometimes I'm scared of doing even simple things cuz I dont want to humiliate myself or fail (or ''look like an idiot'') - that for example made me feel strong stomach ache for whole day before my prom. I dream about having a perfect life really often but ye, it just seems like a unreachable dream.

I've recently visited psychologist and he confirmed I have social anxiety. But there was something that I still had been thinking about. I saw some yt videos about narcissism once and it made me curious. So I read a lot about that, learned that there are diffirent types of it. After all things I read I connected a type called **covert narcissist** to myself since I thought it's features matched me . When I went to psychologist again I discussed about it with him but he made it pretty clear to me that I was not really a covert narc because I did not answer clean ""Yes"" even once when he was reading qualities from a DSM list or something like that. I can't really understand it because I noticed that :

\- It makes me happy when I see my friend fail/ ''perform'' worse than me ( It's like Im hoping he does fail so I am superior),

\-I manipulated people quite often / no restrains in doing that

\- I need that constant attention- superiority feeling to feel better than usual,

\- I can't stand losing in anything I am concerned about (Mostly In comparision to that ""best"" friend of mine, also to the other colleagues sometimes) because I find it humilating to lose to ye, a ""friend"" who's worse than me ( I think he is by information I have about him) and should always be.

\- I find it hard to show ""personal"" emotions, empathy, hugging makes me feel uncomfortable. I am also frustrated when I see people worse than me (uglier, dumber) having more success in their social life, I find it unfair.

What is more, in the past when I had more good friends (not just 1 like now), I did make others insult/not like such friend just because I felt offended in some way( those targetted friends never saw me as guilty because I was the ""nice and loyal one"") or for some other irrelevant reason just to feel superior/have some drama - this happened to almost all my ""best"" friends from the past (around 5times) and it always resulted in such relationship ending. There was even one girl-friend who seemed like falling in love with me but I was too ""frozen"" to do sth about that. Back then I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing but now I am and it makes me think a lot about it. I noticed that my best friend who I compare myself to way too much has really dropped his overall life hapiness since we became friends, wouldnt he be a narcisstic victim then? If I am not a introvert version of narcisst then what it might be?",15May2019,1
106,"So for the past few weeks I have been having exams and I think the isolation of having to revise for an exam every few days got to me. Thing is I've never experienced this before, so I don't know how to deal.

Basically, I started feeling really paranoid that someone is constantly watching me or following me. I can only sleep a few hours a night, since for some reason I'm convinced that someone is sitting on the roof watching me from my window and is waiting till I fall asleep to break in, even though rationally I know it's not true. If I drift off to sleep my body starts shaking to wake me up, as if I can't sleep since there's danger nearby, until pure exhaustion makes me completely pass out. If I don't leave my room during the day the thinking goes away for a bit, but comes back in the evening when I'm going to bed. If I do leave my room, I think that someone's in the garage peering through the slit in the door (which opens slightly from wind sometimes), watching me in the kitchen. When I go to the toilet, I think someone is gonna either attack me from behind from down the stairs or slip into my room while I'm not there and watch me when I get back (there's nowhere to hide in my room tho). If I leave the house and I'm walking somewhere, I have to take the route that takes twice as long through the main streets rather than my usual one through smaller alleys, because I feel like someone is just waiting for the right time to jump me.

I know none if it is probably true, but damn doesn't my mind think so... Does anyone have any advice in dealing with this?

109,"Years ago, I was on Citalopram 10 mg for panic attacks by my general practicioner. I felt great. I was able to get my fear of heights under control on that dosage. I was eventually able to get off of it and haven't had a panic attack since.  Well, I started hitting myself when I got really angry and I am currently seeing a psychiatrist. She diagnosed me with OCD. I forgot what dosage I was on prior and she prescribed the 20 mg dosage to control my hitting compulsions, thinking that was the dosage I was on.

110,"I love my family because they're my family. But we don't talk to each other about anything besides perhaps the weather, what we're having for dinner or that thing we saw on TV. There is **never** any deep emotional or meaningful discussion about anything, and it has always been this way. I've made many attempts to change this but it falls on deaf ears. It's isolating and it's boring.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember being so desperate for attention as a child but being dismissed because, for example, dad was too busy reading his book or mum was too busy cleaning. It was like they just couldn't be arsed. I was repeatedly told to go and amuse myself instead of bothering my dad in particular, who was very stoic and always has his mind elsewhere. Family holidays consisted of driving for hours in complete silence. If anyone broke the silence my dad would roll his eyes and become very irritable. He just kind of hated talking. So I became very used to this and learned to just stay quiet. I've struggled with social anxiety a lot as an adult, I think because I was brought up to believe that talking a lot was bad. Talking to people for a long period of time feels exhausting and kind of ***wrong***. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents didn't talk to each other, either, and their relationship was/is not a very happy or communicative one. They are never affectionate with one another and sleep in separate beds. It's just a very disjointed family and I don't want to end up in a relationship like theirs. I feel this enormous urge to connect with people but something always holds me back. It really affects me and I am not sure how to change my attitude towards connection when this is how I was brought up.",15May2019,278
111,"Hey y’all. My psychiatrist hasn’t responded to my message in a week, as of today, and I’m getting concerned. I don’t go back to see her for another 2 weeks, and I ran out of my medicine 3 days ago. I haven’t been feeling too bad without it but I need to be taking it. Last week she changed my dosage of Prozac from 10 to 40mg in hopes that it would be more effective. When I messaged her last week I let her know that I really wasn’t feeling any better and that my anxiety was keeping me home from work. I also missed my DBT class, and I will have to pay a $50 fine for it today. I am genuinely afraid that my anxiety is going to cause me to lose my job or keep me from doing other things I need or want to do. I’m not really sure if the Prozac was the cause of my anxiety last week but either way, I don’t want to live like this anymore. I just don’t know what to do. During my last appointment I asked if I was allowed to call her if needed and she said to just message her through the patient portal or go to the ER for an emergency. I tried calling anyways, there’s no option to speak with a doctor or even a nurse. I have to go to DBT today, should I ask reception for help? Is this is a sign I need to find a new doctor?

Right now im just trying to pass the grade and I cry almost every day. Ive been taking meds for depression but as of late I was considering suicide. Thinking its the only way out... to maybe see my mom again and take away the stress. Ive talked about it with my step mother and my counsolers. They made me stop taking my meds since the side effects may cause thoughts of suicide. Im worried about myself and if I do not pass this grade that my future might be ruined.

I have a good life, a steady job, good friends, a humble family and a loving girlfriend. My future is looking reasonably good and I am happy. 

But I can't get negative thoughts out of my head, while I'm working and not talking to anyone, my thoughts go lose and I can't stop it. I'm thinking about my girlfriend and what could go wrong, what I'm possibly doing wrong, and I can't get it to stop. 

Small things that happen, or even things that are positive still get twisted in my head and make me feel sick. I even had the feeling I was going to cry, and that is rare for me (not trying to brag but I want to get my point across through) I try to tell my thoughts to be positive and I tell myself in my head ""I don't remember asking you a god damn thing"" it helps sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't.

121,"So, long story short, mentally I’m a bit messed up. I have been for many years but at university I was exposed to drugs and have since quite successfully used ketamine (primarily, along with weed and cocaine), to keep the darkness from returning. 

But anyways I’ve finally decided to give antidepressants a proper go, to treat my depression and anxiety (and OCD and body dysmorphia). I’m happy about this, it feels like a bit step in the right direction but...

I obviously can’t stop taking drugs until well into the course of sertraline and I feel good, though this kinda makes me question whether the antidepressants are ever going to work?

Say, for the 8 weeks it takes to kick in, I’d like to take drugs so I don’t, say, kill myself, and then hopefully feel good enough to just not wanna take drugs anymore...is this how it will work?

I mean, I could try to not take drugs while the antidepressants kick in but the whole process of that and whether or not it even does work for me or I need different pills etc, makes me just want to continue self-medicating with drugs until I naturally feel better with antidepressants. 

I suppose my question is, will the antidepressants even work at all while I’m still taking drugs?

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study exploring potential protective factors against suicide. You do not have to have experienced suicidal thoughts to take part, as we are interested in the protective factors too.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone over 16 years of age and fluent in English can take part. If you decide to participate we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every month for the next two months. The questionnaire should only take around 20-25 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the questions will ask about current mood, any suicidal thoughts or self-harm. If there is a chance that this could be upsetting, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to take part, please click the link below.

126,"I’ve thought about making this post for the past week but honestly I’ve been kind of scared to. I am a 17 year old junior in high school and I’m just struggling right now. During freshman year, 2 years ago, I stood up one day and just felt off. I don’t know why, but I just felt like reality stopped feeling real to me. Like my body was just kinda doing whatever, and almost like I was having a really bad high all the time. I struggled with it for a couple months, and it got so bad for me that when me and my dad went to the airport for a vacation to visit my relatives, I panicked and I had to get picked up and he went by himself. Now I struggled with this feeling for months and I guess it finally went away. It was a slow process, but I felt normal again. But it’s back. I was sitting at home at about 3am about two weeks ago on a Saturday and my friend called me and asked if I could please pick him and some others up, they were stranded like 3 miles from the house they were staying at and didn’t have a car. On the drive over there I started to feel that...off feeling again. I almost freaked out and went home, but I didn’t, I picked them up and brought them back to their house. I had hoped it was just a temporary feeling because I was tired, but after that night I’ve been feeling like that most of the time. I’ve also been having really bad anxiety when it comes to driving, for no reason. Driving has been one of my biggest passions since I was a kid, but now I dread getting in the car.

127,"BTW I'm form Europe so the education system is different

I constantly put myself down and I just feel like I am seeking attention with this...

I've been feeling really really lonely even tho there's usually a lot of people around me and I figured out I just don't have friends. 

This is my first year of high school (I'm turning 16 this year) so the environment really changed and I don't have any old friends that live close where my campus is. 

Since I went into a school that isn't hard, and I am  capable of more, me and my classmates aren't really on the same wave length. So yea I just don't have classmates that I'm close with. 

Everyone that I hang out or hanged out with just replaced me or have other people to hang out with. So that feels like shit. 

And the one friend I am close to and we talk online is on a different school with people more important to her than me. For me it isn't like this she is just my best friend and it's sad that nobody thinks that of me. So I just feel kinda pathetic all the time. I am always alone and I'm not used to it. Like yeah I am independent but in a crowd I was never alone. 

Also questioning my sexuality isn't doing me a favor either. 

Then I started cutting again bc I'm stupid and just so someone would notice that something may be wrong with me. But no. Noone noticed. 

Also mental breakdowns are a part of my life since I was literally 10 and crying the night before I had a presentation. 

And I am overweight and I am trying to be healthy and lose weight. I've been going to the gym since January and it was great and my mental health also improved. But then my fitness buddy went somewhere else and I was left alone. So now I haven't been to the gym for a month and I feel really bad about it.",15May2019,3

I was never really raised by them, just punished for doing the wrong things, my sister however, was the only one I could say sort of raised me, if she wasn’t there, I’d probably be crazy or way worse then I am now.

My depression and stress has been bad these last two years of high school, the older I get, the more evident my bad upbringing has had more effect on me then I thought. Last year, I even thought of taking my life.

My dad is now my only parent, and while things are less tense then when I barely saw him when my stepmom was here... he’s still barely there for me emotionally.

I needed help, and I finally told him about my stress and depression and about how what my mom did scared me, but he brushed it away... didn’t believe me. I had a situation at school where I lost it and ended up telling them how I felt even those thoughts, and they told him.

He called me crazy...

And trying to talk to him never works, he never listens

And yet with all of this... he pressures me about school and passing, but he doesn’t help with me not being able to concentrate, he doesn’t believe that stress effects me, he doesn’t believe anything I say.

And my dad, my stepmom, and most adults always put my stress under them, that because they pay bills, they have to take care of kids, and make sure that they’re not on the streets, that my stress doesn’t matter because they’re dealing with bigger problems.

Dogs get stresses, fish gets stressed, even plants get stressed... that doesn’t mean I can’t too...

Basically I got into therapy around 7 months and been having weekly sessions. The reason I got into therapy initially were mild I would say. I was bullied throughout high school and entered adulthood with a frame that I needed to impress people, especially girls, to prove myself I was worth it. So whenever someone would get more attention from someone else, especially if the person was a girl, I would just hate myself and beat myself tremendously and force myself to get that attention back.

And there was this guy in my class that had this wacky, high-energy sense of humor, often at the expense of others, but he got the attention of everyone. A lot more than I ever had, especially from that girl. She would leave me talking alone to go talk to him, or if she was sitting down she would ask me to ask him to sit down with her, without ever inviting me to do the same. Intense and constant feelings feelings of unworthiness, disrespect, jealousy, self-hatred got me to contact my college's pro-bono CBT therapist. But it didn't help. I've posted this on here before a few times and people mostly adviced me to find a new therapist, but unfortunately I don't have the monetary means and my parents are VERY strict with me academically (they used to beat me when I was younger and had anything less than a perfect score, used to lock me in my room to study, and today they yell at me. They never cared about my emotional well being a whole lot). I thought if I just kept going to sessions and cut all contact with that girl and anyone else envolved things would go away

They didn't. They escalated a lot. Internally and externally. Initially it was just about me thinking I didn't have the type of humor or personality needed to start a romantic relationship or get attention and this had me feeling inferior. Then that guy started ""spreading"" to the point everyone on our class was always around him and looking for him. It slowly became about my total inability to have any sort of connection with anyone. I feel extremely alone right now, and I feel like I don't have the skillset to connect with people. I feel absolutely unworthy of connections and bonds, and I feel like everyone else has them except for me. This guy represents that for me. And I can't say what exactly he is doing that I am not. I just know that whatever he does works, and whatever I do always repels people.

I stopped going to classes because the frustration and anger and self-hatred at seeing how close he is to everyone, especially to that girl, is too much. I also lost my closest group of friends in the last days, they just simply stopped inviting me to stuff and cut me off. But then again, I rarely ever felt connected and safe with them as well.

Therapy has not been working. Yesterday I had a 6 hour session because she was worried about me. But the whole session was about seeing my thoughts as thoughts and not as the reality. Well the reality is still there. It's a constant thing. I can't deny it. So that concept makes no sense to me.

Today I tried going to class with that mindset. I got in 1 hour late, people had formed groups at the start. Approached a group of 2 girls, they said it was groups of 2 max so I had to find someone else. Went to a group of 3, they said it was a group of 3 max... looked over to see the other girl leaning all over the guy and it was just too much. Left, got into the car, started punching the steering wheel. I mean there's more red than black in that thing now. I'm bleeding from all my knuckles on my right hand

I don't feel safe anymore. I don't trust myself driving my goddamn car. All the way home I just wanted to drive it into something. I have clue how I managed not to do it, got close several times and had to steer or brake at the last seconds. It isn't the first time this happens, but the intensity has been growing.

I can't go to classes. I can't study. I can't stand still at home. I don't feel safe touching that car again. Right now I'm in tears because of all this emotional pain but also because I can barely bend my fingers without sharp pain and the amazing things it doesn't bother me and I kinda like it. Help. How do I bring this up to my parents? Any tips? And how do I bring this up with my therapist that I don't feel our sessions have been helping that much, since she obviously cares so much that we have had several 4+h sessions totally pro-bono?",15May2019,1

150,"I am 23 soon to be 24, left my country when I was 19, came to London , worked minimum wage jobs such as waiter and hotel reception, money has always been an issue especially when living in such an expensive city. Even when I came I still takes to people , still had friends. Spelt my mental health has gone to shreds, I am in a happy relationship and we are living together for about 8 months, I love her but I don’t love myself.
I don’t find joy anymore, we love in a room and share a house with strangers as many others, I still cling to a bit of hope I will be “rich and famous “ somehow, but whatever happens I cannot find joy or excitement in anything, my days are truly dull, I don’t remember last time I laughed or was excited or something, I don’t feel excitement for anything to come, I am scared to die, and I’m always aware of death, I believe I have some sort of thanatophobia, my anxiety is getting worse and so is my depression , I barely eat and when I do is crappy food that makes my stomach hurts. I breath hard. I mostly feel ill but I blame it on heath anxiety.  
I got no will to get out of bed and do anything, I just wait for days to pass, I either play PS4 games or go for a coffee and smoke, that’s when I’m not working.

151,"Last year I completed my GCSE exams and finished secondary school. I never really felt particularly motivated before hand, but I put plenty of effort into studying.

As I was sitting my exams I thought that the work that I had put into studying for the past 3 years would probably be enough to get me through them, and subsequently stopped all revision.

After that I pretty much stopped caring about schoolwork or achieving any goals, though I think I had already become desensitised to success because I kept getting awards for not even trying my hardest; my failures were what I focused on instead.

The results came back, and after doing some maths and research I calculated that I was somewhere around the top 22% nationally (I think, I'm probably wrong about that). I felt no sense of achievement other than a brief surprise, and instead felt disappointed for not measuring up to the people in my friend group.

Now I can barely get out of bed without the help of 9 alarms and the morning sunlight, and I feel somewhat sick even thinking about taking on medium sized homework tasks.

I would appreciate any advice on how to regain my previous work ethic.
I have other issues that probably need to be dealt with, but right now I feel like I just need to get motivated again to pass my A-levels. Everything else can wait.

(Sorry for the long post; short version: I've lost the motivation to study, could you give suggestions that might help me get it back? Thank you in advance.)",15May2019,2
152,"\*\*\*I posted this on r/bipolar but received no response and I need advice.

I'm dealing with my first mixed episode since I was 17 (now 26) and caused me to be hospitalized for 3 months. During that last episode I had psychosis and was on at least 10 different medications that I don't remember what exactly happened/ how I felt/ how the episode ended. Currently I think I'm getting better and then get bad news (generally school and work related things) and it sends be back to where I was before. Unfortunately, any meds that I've been placed on to help me out have made my symptoms much worse, so I just have to ride out the mania without any extra medical help (been on lamictal since I was 16 and have always been med compliant). I had to take an incomplete in two classes and don't have an internship for the summer because I was rejected for everything I applied to (never do interviews while manic because then you might be ""too high energy"" for the job) , so I have a ton of free time to get better.

Here are my questions;

1. How do I know if I'm actually getting better?
2. Will I crash like other manic episodes?
3. What can I do to get better?
4. Will it continue in waves?
5. When will it end?",15May2019,3
153,"Okay so I walked downstairs to pick up dinner as per usual and on the TV was a piece on male mental health. I express mild gratitude that the issue is getting noticed after being neglected in society for so long, but right at the end before I can turn around to go back upstairs, they begin listing off help resources. I sneer, ""hmpf"" and my eyes meet my sister's for a split second as I turn to go downstairs. She offers me a coke, I decline and make my way back upstairs.

My sister comes back upstairs to me to offer me the coke again, and mentions that I've been quiet today. I understand this but shrug it off and take the coke to get her to leave me alone, before eating my food.

159,"Hi. 19yo male here. Over the past few years I’ve noticed that I experience mood swings where I’ll be perfectly fine but these small things that pop into my head can ruin an entire day. For example, this past year I got my heart broken and even though I think about her sometimes, it can really differ how much it bothers me. I’ve had days where I wasn’t feeling 100% but still ok, but when something small but negative comes to mind it can really crush me and make me stay in bed all day. And on the other hand I can have days where I’m super happy for no apparent reason. 

My dad is bipolar, so I’m kinda «worried» I’m like him even though I don’t really think it’s a terrible condition to have. My dad does handle it quite well now, but I know he’s had a couple rough patches throughout the years. 
I guess what I’m looking for here is answers to if it is normal to have these mood swings, especially these «can barely get out if bed»-days, and what I can do to get better at dealing with them whether or not I have a condition. 
Also, how does one get diagnosed with bipolar disorder? It’s kinda taboo to talk about in my family and I don’t live with my parents anymore so that’s why I’m turning to reddit.

The breaking point was the day before yesterday when I had a psychotic episode that lasted 24 hours. I made an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist and he suggested that we wean off of the Geodon and replace it with the Abilify. We had been talking about this for months but never did because I was so scared of spiraling down again. But at this point something has got to change.

166,"""I'm sorry""

When you hear the news,
Please don't weep,
I know it was selfish,
But life was too hard for me.

I knew life was precious,
And I promise I tried to stay strong,
But a person who's already broken,
Can only fight for so long. 

I know I looked fine,
I even could laugh,
But those times were only minutes,
They never did last.

No one saw the pain in my eyes,
Or the trembling hands,
Or how my bed was an anchor,
On the days I could barely stand.

I knew I had support,
And family and friends,
But words can only do so much,
For someone who only sees the end.

I can't tell you when it started,
It creeped up on me so fast,
My dreams and ambition,
Was quickly a thing of the past.

I began to lose focus,
And could no longer recognize myself,
No medication or diet,
Could reverse my mental health.

I tried long walks and calling loved ones,
I wanted them to hear it in my voice,
I wish I could blame them for not saving me,
But ultimately it was my choice.

I tried meditation and breathing,
But the thoughts would not leave,
It didn't matter how many deep breaths I was taking,
I was always suffocating.

Anxiety and depression,
Doesn't discriminate,
Before I even realized it had me,
It was already too late.

I'm sorry that this happened,
I didn't want to cause anyone pain,
But you have to understand,
What I went through each day.

You may think it was selfish,
But tell me what's more wrong?
To leave this life behind,
Or beg someone who's suffering to keep holding on?

Trust me I wish I was stronger,
I wish I could've grown old,
I wish I could've held on,
I wish I hadn't grown so cold.

I wanted to be successful,
And be someone's wife,
But the world lost its color,
I could only see black and white.

All I can do is say sorry,
And I hope the world treats you better,
Please don't cry for me, 
Just smile and say ""I'm glad that I met her"".

I didn't wake up today,
I wasn't anchored to my bed,
I wasn't feeling hopeless,
Because of the thoughts in my head.

Instead I am gone now,
My memory is left behind,
Suicide is powerful,
Almost as powerful as my mind.

in fact, i feel so incredibly confused and isolated and invalidated. ive always struggled with a sense of identity, and ive never fully identified with my diagnosis of anxiety/depression that i received at age 16. after coming to college, my mental state has drastically declined and now i live my day to day life with sudden mood swings, complete lack of motivation, lack of sense of self, and impulsive behaviors. i fluctuate between believing that something is more seriously wrong with me than depression/GAD and convincing myself that i am in fact not mentally ill and am just dramatic or attention seeking.

In exchange for their participation, participants will have the choice to be entered in a drawing for a chance to receive one of four **$50 Amazon gift cards.**

A few important things to know about the study are:

1. **No personal identification will be linked to questionnaire responses**; data collection will be **completely anonymous.** Unidentified responses (and email addresses for the gift card drawing collected via a separate link) are kept on our secure server, password-protected, and viewed only by research staff.
2. Participation is completely online and is expected to take **about 15 minutes.**
3. **Participation is voluntary.** The link we provide will direct potential participants to a website telling them about the study. Once on that site, they can decide if they want to participate. If anyone starts to participate and decides they no longer feel comfortable or they are no longer interested, they can end their participation without any penalty.
4. In addition to collecting information from participants, we will also provide links to **treatment and informational resources** following study participation.
5. This study will include only participants who are **18+ years old.**

If you are interested in participating in this research study, you can access the questionnaires at the following link:

178,"my life is pretty much numb and most of the times I'm so numb it becomes extremely hard to check up on my friends who are also struggling. I'm so tired and I am always busy and I can't bring myself to talk to them,  my mental health is in shambles.  My friends get mad at me for not caring enough about them,  they think I just ""take"" and not ""give"" back (which is not true I neither take neither give,  I just don't have the energy anymore)  Am I really a bad person?  I do love my friends very much but should MY own mental health be an valid enough reason to not check up on theirs?",15May2019,1
179,"My wife used to enjoy being on a leash and calling me her master. I let her fulfill a fantasy and dropped her off at a male friend of my owns house to let her be used for 3 hours. She has worn the leash once since then and it was only recent. Her rendezvous was almost a year ago at this point. After her time with him she yelled at me once while drunk and said I’d never be able to do the things he can, she wrote about it all in great gratuitous detail on Reddit and I read it. My sex life hasn’t been the same since then and it beats down on me every day. I miss putting that leash on, my name being moaned, her trusting me to submit to me (which now I’ve been doing for her, role switch much lol) and we finally talked about it last night. She told me she didn’t trust me with it anymore. It’s heartbreaking and I’m having a lot of trouble dealing with it as well. Thinking about how trusted he was and how a year later she still calls him an amazing lover that she can’t get over. I feel worthless.",15May2019,1
180,"Tl;dr I feel like I’ve become a pathological liar and also I might be bisexual but my family is Christian so don’t know what to do

I just wanna say this because it’s become to much to bear, I feel like I just wanna die, I wanna be gone, I want to be forgotten. Im very well known for being a liar and hypocrite but even i don’t know why. My life is great, my parents love me but the problem is that I hate myself, I’m a terrible person, I’ve become abusive, afraid, self destructive, I don’t what to do. I procrastinate all day even in class and I’m most likely going to fail school, everyone thinks I’m lazy, even me, but I know that it’s not the case, something is wrong with me, everyday I feel less and less like my self, I’ve become socially awkward and I just want to die, help me.",15May2019,1

182,"Fron the UK here - my (27f) boyfriend (23m) unfortunately suffered horrible physical and emotional abuse from the ages of 6 to 16, at the hands of a violent alcoholic stepdad. His mum did nothing to stop it, and worked a lot so didnt witness the violence often, but knew it was happening and covered it up to other family members. (Awful behaviour on both parts). 

My boyfriend's PTSD makes him stressed and angry at work (he works with some very small minded and petty people). He is never angry at me, bless him. 

He also has anxiety and low self esteem. His confidence and sex drive is low because he has put on weight. And even though I think he looks GORGEOUS and i tell him all the time, he doesn't feel confidence from within. 

He also has bulimia. When I'm out sometimes he will binge eat and make himself sick, which is intertwined with both the PTSD and the self confidence due to his weight. It's all quite complex, but after years of doing it every day after most meals, he now only does it occasionally when I am at work (once a week or less). 

We have joined the gym so that he can work on his fitness and confidence, and I'm hoping that this will also help with the bulimia. 

He is already in therapy and on medication. 

He doesn't want to talk about his past trauma at the moment and his therapy is more based on the present/future due to the fact that the upheaval of the trauma only creates a worse mental state for him. This is at the suggestion of the therapist, but I feel that perhaps he should talk about it all when he's ready. 

We have talked about how he feels and are working on it all together, and he is looking forward to the gym, I'm just searching for more advice on how to help him, and things we may not have thought of.


I'm just wondering what I can do or what we can do together to help him? 
Has anyone been through a similar thing and found that talking makes the problem worse and it's best to focus on positive changes, or does talking help when ready? 

Any advice greatly appreciated.",15May2019,1
183,Therapist moved a couple months back. Had first appointment with the second one i tried and idk its too early to tell i geuss but for some reason just doesnt feel right. Maybe im being too picky. Just now am realizing how good my last therapist was. Anyone go through anything similar?,15May2019,1
184,"Yes, this means butchering a few sacred cows. No, sitting at your home, watching The Office for the 10th time isn't mentally healthy. No, neglecting your friends for watching TV DOES NOT MEAN you care about them, and if they kill themselves you have no right to bitch and moan. If you lead an unhealthy, negative narrow lifestyle you spread it around and cause damage to others. Suicide prevention isn't just about caging suicidal people but actively moving to a more welcoming, active environment.

If this offends you, you just might be the problem.",15May2019,1
185,"  

I am recruiting participants for my thesis research, entitled Adult Attempted Suicide and how it Affects Quality of Life. If you are 29 or older, have attempted suicide at least once, attempted suicide 2-10 years previous to being at least 29, are a resident of the United States and are available, participation has two parts: (1) completing an online survey that includes demographic questions and an abbreviated version of the Reasons for Living Inventory by Marsha Linehan, and (2) scheduling a time for a 30-45 minute phone interview with the researcher. The phone interview will ask questions relating directly to participants’ (last) suicide attempt. After the phone interview is complete, the participant will be emailed a code for a $15 Tango gift card incentive. The information will be kept confidential unless the individual is perceived to be in imminent danger to themselves or others. For more information, please click the link below:

186,"I feel bad, but good at the same time I guess. It's mostly because of my love rejecting. So first. I hate all of my friends, even though I hang around them, I despise them, they are a lot less than me. Second. Girls that liked me and I liked back, I let them go, because I feel like I didn't deserve their love or maybe I didn't want any of their love. If I start dating anyone serious, it would probably ended up in them hating me. Third. I'm really close with my family and they are probably the only ones I love, but still when my parents show me love, I get angry and I'll go doing something else, but I love them to death. So... I really don't know what to do. I want to feel loved by other people, but don't want to at the same time ?",15May2019,2
187,"All I do all day is just sit in my room and play video games. I have a few friends but none of them are really positive people and I wouldn't consider any of them great friends. I've never had a close friend, I can't understand the concept of having someone you tell everything too. Honestly, I feel like something that's not supposed to socialize and stuff but still wants to, I mean like an animal. I've worked out and stuff and my social confidence has increased, but it still feels not right. I can't let myself let go like that. There's been once where I kinda did that, for like an hour or less maybe, and it was really good. Sometimes I cry thinking maybe I'm autistic or something, then the next day that thought seems totally absurd, and then I think it again. I've never had a two-way conversation with anyone. People will try to joke with me and I literally pretend I didn't hear them (even though it's probably obvious i did) because I don't know how to respond. I feel almost trapped, like there's a version of me that could do that, but it's not this version of me. I've had some friends for years and I still do the thing where I pretend I didn't hear them because I don't know how to follow along. Every time I walk, sit down, anything in front of another person I'm way to aware of exactly the way I'm doing it, and I can't help it. I'm in therapy and on antidepressants (this was before those) can someone please help me somehow or give me advice?",15May2019,1
188,"I see a lot of posts about peoples struggles. I've had depression for a long time now and it would be great to hear ways other people cope and what they do to help them feel better! 

I sometimes like to focus on being creative, whether it's drawing or doing crochet as it gives me the feeling I've achieved something and makes me focus instead of worrying about things all the time.

It would be great to hear what helps you guys - I would like to try something different as it can be hard to be in a creative mood sometimes and then I end up doing nothing and feel down all the time",15May2019,3

I could go into detail but I don’t want to scare anyone. I didn’t feel anything. I wasn’t scared I didn’t feel bad nothing, nothing at all. Why? All I really feel is angry with myself.

193,"Hello, at 17 I got obsessions with compulsions that took a minimum of 15 hours a day... I went to a hospital and got diagnosed with severe schizophrenia and low IQ (i tried to convince them I had OCD and needed cbt but never got it).

I was pushed to work at a community farm and only got Risperdal and citalopram which didn´t help so I spent years doing nothing but my compulsions and obsessions.

&amp;#x200B;

at 22\~  it stopped and I am 23 now... I don´t have any positive symptom now but my brains and social skills are gone.

I applied at an internship for programming and lasted for 6 months but I just don´t have the cognition prowess anymore

I am really angry at my family and mental health services that they left me for dead on that farm and that they took my early 20´s because of not helping me getting treatment.

they all downplay it that I need to be happy that I am cured and that the past doesn´t matter

I got a lawyer but it is just too complex suing for a medical lawsuit when my brain is scattered.

whole environment act liked it never happened meanwhile every day I am boiling with more rage.

my quality of life forever impacted because some people were too lazy to get me into treatment and doing their job properly

and with this, I can´t go to a therapist because they will just try to defuse the situation but I know I am in the right to be compensated.",15May2019,2
