0,"I can't stop thinking of things I don't want to think about, or someone doing something I know they would never do.

Yet I convince myself it's true and then hate myself for not being good enough.

I go from loving someone after just fucking meeting them, then as if they kicked me in the teeth I hate them for no reason.

I can't control it.

All I want is to die because I can't trust my own thoughts, emotions or identity.

I feel nothing, but when something happens and I do feel, it's extreme. Funny ~ Hysterical, Sad ~ Turmoil, Irritation ~ Rage.

I can't control it.

I'm losing myself in the maze of my own creation. I want to die.

I can't bring myself to kill myself but the building want and need is driving me nuts.

I've isolated myself because I can't control my emotional reaction to my friends.

The medication helps the anxiety but nothing else. I'm going nuts and I can't figure out how to fix it.

I'm currently in love with my friend who've I've only known for half a year, I keep imagining her betraying in some way and I hate her for it. I'll block her. I'll ignore her for weeks until I switch back into putting my soul into her.

She has no idea. I don't want to tell her because it'll probably just scare her away if it hasn't already.

All I've ever wanted in life was happiness, a good life and a family. I don't care about the job. I don't care about the money. I just want a peaceful ending.

But all I've ever had it seems is abuse and self destructive behaviour.

I just want to die. I don't want to exist anymore. I can't handle it anymore. I don't want too. I just want to go.

I'm sorry.

I think death is my only release. I can't find anything that works.

I can't bring myself to do it, but I just want to go.

Is that weird? Am I broken?

I suppose.

The psychiatrist isn't very helpful. The medication isn't. Nothing is working.",16Oct2019,3
1,"The meds I'm on that have been stabilizing my moods for months turned out to have a side-effect. I have a lot of trouble with concentration and it's seriously affecting my schooling. I am missing lectures because even though I show up, I can't focus on what the prof is saying. Exams start next week and I feel like I won't do well. I have to have perfect grades or else I lose my spot in this program, lose my chance at grad school, lose my scholarship, and I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth it.

The other day (Thursday) i had a serious suicide scare - the worst in months - because my doctor put me on 5mg of Abilify to help with the focus issues. Things got really bad. I called my partner for help... and he dumped me because I'm ""too stressful"" for him. I thought that would be the trigger to grab the knife tbh. I almost did it, but I knew that those feelings were influenced by the Abilify, so I shouldn't listen.

It's Tuesday and I've realized that I am alone. The only person who cares for me now is my Dad. My friends at school have changed programs and become distant, my partner dumped me, and I don't really have anyone to talk to anymore.

I seem to always end up in this spot. I've struggled with suicide for many years and clung to the idea that things would get better, but here i am later, still broken, still hurting. I'm not under the effect of the Abilify right now, and I still feel like dying. I'm feeling logical right now, weighing my pros and cons, and I need someone to give me some more pros because right now I'm just so numb.",16Oct2019,2
2,"*This is to raise awareness, not ask for advice.*

Panic attacks can be hard to deal with. I've had them since I was 7 (I'm 26 now), and I've been in therapy for them since I was 11. I've been on medication for them for 3 years now.

They can stem from anything, but mine stemmed from trauma and abuse. 

They make you feel horrible: feelings of doom, rapid heart rate, shallow or difficultly breathing, nausea/vomiting, fearfulness, sweating. It's just an inappropriate fight-or-flight response. Some people can figure out their triggers, while others spend their whole lives living in fear of the next attack. Some people (like myself) are so attuned to their bodies that they can ""feel"" an attack beginning -sort of like an epileptic has an aura before a seizure.

But what people don't really know is that they can also happen during sleep. Last night, for the first time in 3 years, I had a nocturnal panic attack. All the symptoms are the same, but they occur during sleep and can wake you. 

For people like myself, with an overactive limbic system thanks to years of child abuse, this is just a sign of the brain ""throwing bad code."" These especially make you feel ""crazy,"" because what would you be triggered from while you're sleeping?

So I just want to let my fellow ""panickers"" know that these are completely normal with Panic Disorder. If you haven't considered it already, SSRIs helped me a ton with my attacks.

3,"After watching the movie Joker it was hard not to see how much it mirrored reality for so many people. Particularly for those who feel rejected and beaten down by a broken system and society. 

The film portrayed society, supporting him in dealing with his feelings of the broken system. His violence was due a sense of hopelessness and rejection in order to bring some sort of personal justice.

This made me wonder if the recent senseless knife crimes are also a way of the youth trying to show how broken they feel. Perhaps also feeling a sense of hopelessness to the current situation?

4,"So I spent the first 7 months of 2019 in the worst depressive episode of my life. In late July through September I felt a lot better thanks to a combo of medication, an in-house stay at the psychiatric ward, intensive outpatient therapy, one-on-one therapy with my psychologist, and ketamine. In the past few weeks, though, I seem to have relapsed. A number of things I can’t stop thinking about:

- I have nothing to look forward to in life
- I’m only going to get older and I am nowhere near ready for that
- I have no purpose
- My ADHD/lack of executive functioning will prevent me from ever succeeding in work
- Even if I did succeed in work, there’s nothing I really want to do

To make matters more intense, I am supposed to be moving across the world to teach English in Spain. I’m afraid to go in the middle of a depressive episode, but the idea of not going completely derails my life plan and makes me want to die. 

I want so desperately to believe that this is temporary, but it’s really hard to do so when I have been living through hell on and off for 9 months. If anyone has words of support or comfort I would really appreciate it. I’m so tired.",16Oct2019,2
5,"Heya~ so, things haven't been going well at the moment, but I'm sure you could infer that from me even posting, but you didn't press on this to hear about an angsty teen babble, or well you did but- sorry getting off of topic. Anyhow, I come here today in search of genuine help, so I hope you can entertain me for a bit.

He's a a thirteen turning fourteen  year old middle schooler and recently, he has  been at his... lowest or at least the lowest for a stupid kid. His parents got divorced when he was younger since his dad had been cheating, and my deadbeat of a father had tried to convince him that his mother was tearing his family apart, and that shit really stuck with him causing him to get bypolarism, or at least that's what he says. At the time this all happened he had become very attached to his friends as they were the only things that didn't cause him trouble in life. The boy would cry to himself every time one of his long time friends had moved, despite knowing that he was most likely the only person who had such an attachment to his classmates. His mother had began a search for a father for her two kids, failing twice due to different ideologies,  finally, his mother had found the man she wanted to be her children's father. The son, was angry, he had always wanted a dad but feared change, although he had kept quiet about it, and finally this  summer the boy had moved in (with his mother and sister) into his stepfather's house
. the boy had a month's worth of time to mentapy prepare  for it but he had been blinded by sorrow, with his unhealthy attachment to his friends he had cried for days on end, he was angry, but deep down, he knew it was for the better. Better schools meaning better opportunities,and in general a better neighborhood.  Once summer had passed he went to school like any other kid. He felt odd and out of place on the first day, it felt like he had been a stranger invited to a family gathering, a fish in a barrel of frogs. But over time he had begun to like his new school, it was a elementary school so it was very different, lacking the drama and violence at his old school with everyone acting older than they were, opposite to the chaotic loud innocence of his new school, but what's wrong with a little crazy in life. He then learned via eavesdropping on conversations that someone in his class was going to therapy over stress, he could tell beforehand that compared to everyone else in the class that she had acted more pessimistic than the others, causing him to strike a connection with her. He had ended up worrying about her mental health and did everything in his ability to support her, continuously  checking in on her, which the boy had realized later on was very out of character for him, but that didn't matter at the moment, all he could focus on was her issues. But as they say, you should always leave time to worry about yourself when dealing with a depressed person, advice which he unfortunately didn't take. But fortunately,  it didn't end in him becoming depressed himself,no it was much worse. He began to look at himself from an outside perspective.  And realized something damming. The actions he was taking weren't his, but they were his'. He learned that everything he did was to keep up an self made image, everything he had an opinion on had to be validated by some meta logic, but it wasn't his logic, but that of someone else's. He planned out scenarios through his actions,  the results playing out in his head like somevcomic book. He learned his ideologies for living weren't his, he hadn't believed in fate, he wasn't some hero to those in need, he was nobody. ""We're all fated to die one day so why not make it fun for everyone?"" , ""I eat whatever I want no matter whose it is because food isn't something valuable enough to care about"", ""Whenever you get bored just remember that tomorrow you'll forget that you were entirely."" These were some if the things constantly racing in the boy's mind, that he had learned were lies.

 Now you must be wondering why I wrote in the 3rd person, and the reason for that is because none if my thoughts are mine,  even while I was writing this I was conflicted on the way I should write, even as I type this sentence now it's not really me talking, it me writing a story for a reaction, but I don't want  to write for a reaction I need help, but Indont care to  really try to get help, but crying to myself feels good, but I hate self pitying myself, but...
You get it now right. It feels like there are ten people trying to get their opinions out at once, my head hurts I can't stop crying. I need help but the other Me in my head don't,  I dont know which me is me, maybe none of them are. I don't know who I am anymore. I know this probably sounds emo but I assure you that this isn't make belief, sorry if that sounded corny.

6,"So I have been pretty depressed through my teenage years I always kinda thought it would go away as I got older and for a while it did I was getting my life together getting a job, girlfriend, car etc everything a young adult would need to feel complete. But now the high from having all those shiny new things that I could take pride in is starting to wear off and now I feel my depression starting to get worse again. It's a lot different now though probably cause I'm focusing on a lot more then I had to deal with from being a teenager, I mean when I was a teenager all I did was listen to sad music and lock myself in my room. But recently I feel the pressure of adulthood and it's filling my brain with overwhelming amounts of stress, I think the worse part about it all is knowing that if I get lazy and don't give something attention wether it be my girlfriend or my job it can have huge repercussions and demolish everything I have worked for. And because all this pressure is being put down on me I have become quite controlling and paranoid I didn't think that it was that bad until I started too realize first hand that what I was thinking sounded a lil far-fetched sometimes. I mean there is a lot of people I hate for my own reasons and I constantly feel like they are after me not in the sense of killing but like they are constantly trying to ruin my reputation it's gotten so bad that I've memorized their vehicles and license plates just so I can make sure I don't run into them, recently I find it really hard to make friends I just don't trust people like I used to. I have constant mood swings one second I can love a person and the next I think they are against me. It makes it really hard to maintain my relationship my job and other activities. The worse thing so far is I'm starting to believe in the fact demons exist and that people that are against me are demons and the only way I can destroy them is to become a more powerful demon it's not a full delusional episode it's just something I believe in sometimes and it does affect how I act sometimes.
Please give me some advice on where to go from here wether I have actual schizophrenia or something else it's starting to change my life for the worse and I know I need help before it turns into something worse. I'm only 19 so I know that's pretty young for schizophrenia but I'm open to what you guys think it might be. Thank you",16Oct2019,1

8,"Just need to vent for a minute. I was dating this guy for a little bit. I have anxiety and he knows about it. Last night I reached out to him for reassurance about something that was causing me anxiety. He replied with a bunch of question marks and didn’t say anything at all. Today he texted me and basically said something along the lines of “how can you not realize it’s literally impossible for that to happen? I can’t handle having this level of drama in my life regularly”. There a few things wrong with his statement: 
1. I can very well see how what I was anxious about was literally impossible. But that doesn’t stop the anxious thoughts
2. Anxiety and causing drama are NOT the same thing.
3. I reached out to him because I trusted he’d try to help me. I don’t expect people to understand my anxiety, but I expect people to at least try and help me. I’ve explained to him things that help me when I’m feeling anxious, and in this situation he did probably the worst he could’ve done by invalidating my feelings.
4. I understand it may have been frustrating to him that even though he reassured me a few times recently about the same situation that I continue to need more reassurance. But what I don’t think he understands is that I have to live with these anxious thoughts 24/7, he only knows about them when I decide to share with him. So as frustrating it may be to him, it’s even more frustrating and exhausting for me.

All that to say, I’m glad I was able to see how he responds to my anxiety and can stand my ground to remove him from my life. I deserve someone who is willing to help me and not call me dramatic and invalidate my feelings. Rant over, thanks for reading.",16Oct2019,2
9,"I really wanted to just vent about this so yeah. So I’m currently a senior high school student that wants to go to university, but my grades are sub par so I don’t know if I will make it there. It’s not as I don’t study, but I feel as I lose the motivation to very easily.

This is where my problem lies. I feel as I lose my motivation to study due to my parents and the pressure the give me to get into a good university. I feel as my mental state is deteriorating overtime and I feel as a lot of pent up trauma has impacted this as well. I know that My mom is kind to me but, I feel as this is an act because as soon as I do something to displease her she flips out and starts telling me that I should just stop studying and work in McDonald’s forever (typical motivation to get you to study but it really bothers me) and I feel as I can’t trust my mom with anything as if I tell her anything about my school life ,like how I’m stressed because my grades aren’t good , she often will just tell my dad about this without my consent and it really makes me lose faith in her. I personally think I have developed genuine trust issues because of my mother. And that brings us to my dad. My dad is essentially a ticking time bomb as he does not get angry easily but when he does he gets very upset. And when on occasion when they both decide to scold me, they will both ignore me and it makes me feel as they’ve just given up on me.

I’ve developed some social anxiety due to their behaviour and I have trouble interacting with others socially (especially females), but it’s not extremely bad so I can live with it.

But I genuinely feel I have some trauma due to my parents past actions.

When I was 8 I had some trouble with time management so I would be late when preparing for stuff like going out so one time I was late so she just decided to leave for 5 minutes then come back to pick me up, but I’m those 5 minutes I felt so alone and scared and I thought I was worthless. I think I developed some abandonment issues from that as when I talk to someone I get really paranoid when someone doesn’t respond to me quickly. ( I’m sure that this may not seem significant or that severe but it really scarred me)

In around the 5th grade my dad monitored my studies like a hawk . He made sure that I always did my homework and more.( he doesn’t do this anymore) I remember I couldn’t get one concept in social studies so he didn’t let me eat dinner until I could get the concept. ( again it may not seem significant but it was for me)

Frankly, I’m terrified of my parents. I feel as they are out to get me and they hate me for not being the perfect son. Also when I am with them I am walking on eggshells not to displease them. (Especially my dad)I feel as I need their approval to keep going in life and I am almost being controlled my them to a certain extent.

I sometimes feel that I should just run away from everything and just forget about my past experiences.

I feel as I’m just strolling through life just trying to get by and hope someday it will get better.

I know that this is very bitchy and preachy and I’m an entitled bitch that had everything gifted to him and that I’m worthless and that this will make no difference in my life but vented about it makes me feel just a little better about myself.",16Oct2019,2

13,"I am diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, and BPD. These past several years have been extremely trying. Starting with a failed suicide attempt a couple of years after I got back home from Afghanistan where I worked as an infantry combat medic. 

No friends, family, or social media. I can do my shopping online, get groceries delivered to my door, and my favorite thing is to go hiking. Sometimes I can go months without ever actually talking to anyone.

A couple of months ago I had a very serious mental break and was getting ready to kill myself again. Instead, I moved to another state (the third state in a 12 month period) and tried starting over again. 

This time I have actually been seeking treatment and trying to pick things back up. I have a psychologist that I see weekly, attend a few groups at the VA hospital, and am trying to work through medications.

It hasn't been easy trying to get back on my feet. The suicidal ideation is there everyday, although after seeing what my past attempt did to my mother I don't think I could ever go down that road again. I couldn't put her through that again.

What is a good way for me to try to reintegrate myself with people? I have been trying to repair things with my parents, but I don't know if it will ever be natural since it feels like I have to put on a mask whenever I talk to them. Well, to my mother. My father doesn't speak to me anymore.

There's a girl that is interested in me. She's the only friend I have, and the first friend I have had in a long time. We meet a couple months ago. But there is this nagging voice in my head telling me that I shouldn't try to pursue anything simply because I am a little too broken to be around and she's such a good person.

I can’t blame him for that as I’ve always known he wasn’t good with comforting people emotionally. Talking to my parents isn’t usually helpful and just makes me feel like I’m not really fixing anything, just crying to my parents.

22,"Copied from another post of mine.


Long history of mental health issues, emotionally abused/neglected child, filling emotional holes with various substances and vices, the classic 'poor, damaged child' template. Although I've dealt with opiate addictions, months of MDMA/pill binges, a decade long, ongoing cannabis dependence, food has still always been my biggest vice. Even though my mother and I never had any sort of real relationship, she always made sure I was (well over) fed. She used food as a coping mechanism too, as she was morbidly obese for the majority of my life. Snacks and fizzy drinks were almost all I consumed.

I've always binge ate, but never to this extent. For the past few months I've been eating until I'm physically in pain. This requires me to walk to a shop around the corner, which is quite a task when you're agoraphobic. The whole walk I'm saying to myself in my head 'not this shit again' 'this is such a waste of money' 'you're going to get fatter' etc, but I can't seem to stop myself. I start eating stuff on the walk home, and 9/10 times, the whole bag of treats is gone within 10-15 mins. I absolutely destroy everything, multiple thousands of calories, in minutes. I feel absolutely fucking terrible after it. Sometimes I've felt really dizzy and feint, other times like I'm vibrating. My vision goes a little blurry too. I've been pretty sedentary for probably 15 years, which is the same time mental illness really started to take its hold. I can imagine I'm ridiculously physically unhealthy. I've never maintained any sort of healthy diet/fitness regime. Doing things, like working/studying, until a mental breakdown occurs is a biannual event. Everything in my life is controlled by my ridiculous moods and behaviours, as well as a lack of any sort of real medical/familial support.

What is this doing to my body? There's thoughts that pop up quite often whilst I'm eating like 'maybe if you keep doing this you'll be able to kill yourself without actually killing yourself'. Suicidal thoughts/tendencies have also been a plague.

Fortunately I'm in the UK, so I get access to free mental health care. Unfortunately, it's pretty terrible. I've been on the waiting list for a CPN (basically a nurse that comes out to my house every now and again to check on me) for 7-8 months, with no sign of one in sight. It takes 6+ weeks to get an appointment with talking therapies, but I've done that 4 times already and they don't do shit. I don't actually know what to do.

25,"Seriously I feel like the biggest failure and wasted potential in life. I was gifted with some artistic ability as well as being very intelligent, but I can’t apply myself to anything, I easily lose interest in any project I start, I have little confidence in my art as well as creative motivation, social media only manes it harder because nobody bothers to look at my stuff anymore since there are so many people out there who are better at it and more dedicated. I have mental health issues, thyroid issues which cause me to have no energy. I only focused on academics but didn’t try to socialize in college till it was too late, and now because of my mental health I have a minimum wage job because I never got an internship or a salaried job in my life, despite graduating in honors. I’m apparently pretty, but I’ve still never been in any romantic situation, Ive never been kissed, and guys seem to take forever to initiate anything with me anyway. I barely have friends and the ones I do either abandon me or are just busy in their lives at no fault of their own. I’m so tired, I just want to give up because despite having some potential, it is completely negated by my health issues. So I’m just utterly useless honestly",16Oct2019,1

27,"I finally realized I’m depressed, far more depressed than I thought, and I have some sort of anxiety issue too. I’ve completely run myself into the ground at this point. 

I had to drop two classes earlier last week, which killed me and will fuck up my plans to graduate. I’m only in two classes now, and I got a C- on my paper for one of them. I wrote it over the weekend. I don’t remember the weekend, aside from one moment in the shower, I remember looking around and thinking “I feel like somethings wrong” but shrugging it off. 

The issue is, I keep feeling like I’m fine. Then I’ll look back on myself a few hours later and realize that I was not fine, and that I hardly remember what I was doing. Yet I still keep thinking that I’m fine? It’s bizarre. I also seem to be getting some sort of episodes of dissociation which involve high-crisis depressive states where I go in and out it bawling. 

What the hell am I supposed to do? I don’t even know if I should or can continue the semester at this point. I can’t even judge how bad my mental state is, and I have no idea if I should seek a higher level of care or what. I’m already seeing a very good counsellor. But whenever I see her I can’t even really tell her what’s going on because I have a very little grasp on what is going on.",16Oct2019,5
28,"“Ma’am, I spent a lot of time in the homicide department, and I can tell you this is exactly how domestic homicide starts.” 
I was 6 weeks pregnant and had called the Police because my then boyfriend had threatened mine and my child’s life. This was the first call. 
Yes I should have called more often and left much sooner than I did. BUT I LEFT! Yay me! I did it! I left a man who tried to kill me on more than one occasion, openly spoke of how he’d like to murder me. The last time I saw him he turned my ignition off and on four times, while I was driving on the expressway. I pulled over, He took my phone and would not get out of my car. I drove home and ran inside and locked everything. I triple checked the windows all had wood to secure them. Fast forward a few hours and he has sent the police to my house saying I was going to kill myself in the hopes I would be committed. I explained to the police what all had happened that day and in the past. I told them about the car. I told them I was scared of him. They handed me a business card for victim services and walked out my front door, and didn’t look back. I didn’t get to tell them everything, or even show them the bruises. I wanted this to be over. I wanted to be freed from this guy and these people were supposed to make sure of that, but they left. 
I don’t think I slept for at least two days. 
I collected over 200 pieces of evidence and had countless people offering to be a witness. ( thank you all) I went to file an application for a peacebond/ restraining order. The next available appointment was 12 days away. Seriously. And it was the day he happened to have court at the SAME FREAKING TIME. 
“you need a peacebond, 100%, minimum a football field away… The police need to charge him with… as well as provide you with an immediate peacebond.” J.O.P. Rather than giving him a voice in court on this matter. He wrote a letter to the police. I went straight to the police station to give them the letter, finally id be taken seriously right!! No. I got told to call dispatch and an officer will come to your house or email the most recent officer who was involved.  I emailed the officer who came to my house to update him on what extent of damages were done to my car and how to proceed with charges. When I finally heard back from this officer it was 11:55 pm. 
“ this sounds awfully convenient, you don’t sound genuine. This guys record is from before I even became a cop, you don’t want to mess with a guy like this.” Click.
Ever think maybe that I had to sound strong so I could actually talk to you about what I had been through? Because I was not crying while asking for help you assumed I was not genuine? Because I had not called you every time I had to deal with a conflict, you aren’t going to help me when I ask for it? Are you trying to punish me? what is going to happen the next time he gets mad? Will you even come? 
It took me three months of hiding in my bedroom- I still don’t go in to my living room, for me to reach out to victim services. I was absolutely beside myself with anxiety, who was going to believe that I went through this? I didn’t leave so why would they help now? I met this lovely lady who told me I needed to go to the domestic violence unit and this was very serious and it was awful no one had even looked through my evidence. 
I was frozen, I could not call. Everything inside of me went in to the ultimate survival mode. Shut down on everything that is not required. Ie work. I emailed this woman and explained this, and was there anyway she could help me take this next step. 
Raido silence until today. 
I had to email again to say I needed help it is has been 8 days and no reply to my email. THAT’S NOT OKAY! I should not be chasing the people who KNOW I need help. This has to be some cruel joke right? 
No. this is how it is. Theres no one holding my hand. Noone in the system that I am a person who has had their life threatened multiple times. Noone will hear my story. 
There are major reasons why this is still an ongoing thing. If there wasn’t something significant happening I am sure I would have lost my voice and well given up by now. 
I should not have to go down kicking and screaming for you to hear me. 
I am drowning and you don’t care. 
What happens if he kills me? will you be charged too? Or am I going to be a woops.  Will you feel any remorse? Right now I don’t trust you, and that Is the scariest feeling in the world.",16Oct2019,2
29,"Now, you might think that it's normal, people do that to cope and such. In my case though, I find it hard to control, like I need to talk to myself or I would feel anxious for a long periods of time. Sometimes, I just start answering questions in my head loudly and even argue with myself, not realizing that there are people around me. Sometimes, I start screaming at nothing. There are times when I completely lose the track of reality and spend long time standing still imagining things, to the point where I can miss the train, despite the fact that it could be right in front of me.

[i live in the United States, if relevant]. Okay, so I’ve been taking different anxiety medications since childhood. I’m 25 now (also, female bc I think that will matter). I noticed in my late teens-early 20s, the meds I’ve take have dramatically affected my weight, while my lifestyle choices hardly change. 
I was on Prozac and no adderall and then my nurse practitioner switched me to Latuda which made me feel suicidal (which was not something I’d legitimately felt before). I told her I wanted off it and we eventually ended on adderall and Effexor and I lost about 60 lbs in less than a year. 
I am now just taking Effexor and I have gained 80 lbs in less than 18 months. 
I feel like it completely ruined my body and my confidence. 

I should state that my anxiety and depression are under control for the most part, so I do believe Effexor works for me but the weight loss then weight gain concern me.

Also, my nurse practitioner seems to just do trial and error and that’s what messed me up in the first place so I’m scared to say anything, especially since one of the meds made me feel HORRIBLE.


TLDR;I think my meds have made me lose and gain weight at extremes and I don’t want to mention it to my nurse practitioner bc I’m afraid to get even worse side effects",16Oct2019,1

37,"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. A major reason for this is my family. We are poor. The money is just enough for basic needs. My father was abusive. My mother was depressed herself. She always expected me to help her get out of it. Her dreams had become my dreams. She said I was the only thing that made her hopeful. I'm now 20. Over the years I've come to realize that her dreams are not what I want from my life. I want to be my own person. She now thinks I'm a failure. She says everyone around me will leave me. I will be alone. I have no freedom, personal space or any right to say what I feel. Because of this I have become a rebel. I fight for myself but there's always something that makes me feel guilty for doing so. I have a boyfriend I love but my family doesn't know about him. He is the only good thing about my life but my personal problems sometimes get projected towards him. I'm dissatisfied academically as well. I was always told I'm smart by everyone. I thought I'd be doing something good with my life. I now am working for a degree I have zero passion for. I have no hopes for my future. My best friend gave me some money for therapy because she knows I have no money. My boyfriend is always beside me and he says he's willing to pay for my therapist too. So I told my mother I will go to see a therapist. She insisted that she will come with me. I told her I want to do this alone first. She got extremely mad and told me she will not allow me to see one if she cannot come along. We had a major fight because of this. I got a horrible anxiety attack. She started saying stuff like ""you'll see when you don't have a mother"" or ""you are nothing without me. Your friends will use you and leave you"". I started crying.

I've been in therapy since I was 18 and to a psychiatrist for the past 10 years in addition to that. It's been 20 years, and nothing has gotten better. I've been on and off and on meds again. I still have all the same problems.

Naturally, it is my responsibility to get better and nothing or no one can do that for me but myself. That being said, has anyone ever truly gone from living a life of isolation to a healthy social life? Has anyone ever felt lazy for years and years and accomplished nothing only to accomplish a lot after the right meds? Has anyone gone from having severe phobias to being able to deal with those same issues anxiety-free? Was anyone ever really angry and then always at peace?

I’m 30 now and it’s been over for a long time. I have a wonderful husband, amazing friends, and a good job. Almost 2 years ago I finally started talking to my doctor and she put me on a prescription citing that she was pretty sure that I have post Traumatic stress disorder. She put me on some medication and it’s helped, but sometimes I still feel so alone. I know I can talk to my husband and I know I can talk to my friends but I really just don’t want them to worry.

43,"I really don’t want to get into my situation at all but it might be good for me to vent a bit. All I’m looking for is advice with coping and maybe resources.

I have PTSD and TBI. I went through a psychosis this past year that put my relationship with my wife in major jeopardy. We are doing well now after lots of work and marriage counseling. I was raped, by a woman. I’ve heard a lot of people close to me say that It’s my fault because I could have done x y or z. I can’t describe the way that hearing that all over and over has made me feel, other than I get a lump in my throat and my chest gets ‘heavy’ and hurts. What hurts more is my wife was one of those people saying those things. My wife decided to ‘take an unofficial break’ from our marriage last year and cheated on me. She felt justified since I had ‘sex’ with someone else, even though I was raped.

I was extremely abused as a child, physically mostly, by the hands of my father. My parents kicked me out of the house at 15 and my relationship with my mother and father was toxic to say the least. However, later in life my mother got sober and seemed to genuinely start to care about me, or so I thought. We recently had a bit of a falling out and she lives across the country. She decided to file a false CPS report against my wife and I and try to have our Son taken away. I hadn’t talked to her in probably three months and she lives nowhere near me. I’m broken and I don’t know what to do. I’m realizing that no matter how much I try to keep these relationships they seem to just fall apart and everyone leaves when they realize I’m not worth loving or worse they try to harm me. I don’t think I deserve it but there’s this part of me that thinks I do. I’m the only common factor in this long string of fucked up happenings.

Also my brother who lives with my mother, recently called me a fucking retard and started saying I’m a horrible parent to my son. I don’t know where that came from because we always had a decent relationship but I guess my mom is trying to get everyone else in my family to believe her lies so she can feel justified in her false reporting.

At this point I’m just rambling, and I’m sorry if some of this doesn’t make sense or it’s In a weird order, it’s hard for me to organize my thoughts sometimes. How do I cope with all of this?

I even got kicked out of my mothers funeral because I was laughing at something else... or when someone I don’t know is making small talk and tells me of something unfortunate that happened to them, I will smile or laugh.

50,"So, to clear up some things.

I was diagnosed with a disorder called selective mutism when I was 14, but I’ve had it since I was really little. I started going to this recovery and wellness center, which had some great therapists (most of the good ones quit) but their head therapist/owner of company and clinical manager sucks. 

When I was going to group therapy, there was a couple weeks where I was the only kid going before others joined. The head therapist had a talk with me and my mom and said she didn't think I had selective mutism (and of course my mom believed her and not me...I still think I have selective mutism or something very similar). Now, sometimes I go mute when I’m extremely angry, and the head therapist in particular annoyed the hell out of me, I still hate her. My mutism doesn't only happen when I become depressed. During my time there I had been diagnosed with many things, but sadly we still do not know what I have, if anything at all. 

After about 5 months of group I moved onto individual therapy. I had an amazing therapist that I made so much progress with, up until recently, because she resigned (which to me was a red flag because she had only started working there after id been there for a month) So the clinical manager was to become my therapist. Today was my first session with her. Oh. My. God.

A few years ago I had been seeing a psychiatrist, and I hated him. He made me go anger-mute. One thing that he did in particular would be when he’d ask me how I was, and I’d say fine, and he’d ask me to elaborate. Sometimes I would elaborate by describing how my week/day was. NEvertheless i hate being asked to elaborate, but not be told what to elaborate on. 

Back to the present, I walk in, and the first thing she asks is how I was, and I said fine…and then she says “Elaborate on that for me.” and I just shut down. Instead of her asking me to calm down or giving me space, she starts getting mouthy with me. “Y'know not speaking is a choice.” “You know you're tense, right?” “Is this really how you want to utilize your time here?” I was surprised that I almost yelled at her, I also considered just walking out. 45 minutes, I’m just sitting there in silence, I probably only blinked 5 times. 

The session ends and I tell my mom everything in the car, and thank god she agreed to take me out of therapy, because she and I agree I don’t need to be treated like that, and that I had made so much progress, she believed it was necessary for me to attend.

Even though I’ve been previously diagnosed/undiagnosed with selective mutism, is me going mute rude? Was I at fault or justified?

I’m M/21 and about to marry my F/21 Fiancé next month. We get along very very well together and are happy with each other. I work 3rd shift and she is gone 7-5. We do find time to spend together. We bought a house together last March and are very fortunate we make a combined $30.88 an hour together, not counting overtime and bonuses. We live reasonably well within our means, although our bills and debts are a little high, we are on track to pay them off sooner rather than later. As far as hobbies go, I work on my 89 corvette and collect older hot wheels cars. She loves to cook and paint. 

I don’t have much in the way of friends. I really don’t hang out with anybody. I do get along with those around me and my co-workers as well. Emotionally I feel stagnated. I don’t feel much in the way of stress, but I’m never really happy except when I’m with my fiancé. I’m almost never angry or upset. I just don’t have many emotions like I used to a few years ago.

Is it weird I want to believe that? I want to believe in that concept. Is that weird?

I been through a lot but I had hope. Things were hard but I was tough. I knew eventually I would get through it.

This last traumatic experience I’ll never forget. 
I don’t believe I can survive this. I don’t want to believe that I can.

I feel little pieces of my soul falling away and all I can do is cry. It’s been 12 days. I’m getting worse at hiding it from my family.

Everyone depends on me for everything even my parent(s) . I save everyone. I spend every ounce of love and energy I have saving and giving hope to everyone else now I have none left for myself. 

I’m afraid to be alone but I can’t stand the sight of anyone or anything.  I’m so tired of fighting things I’ll never defeat.

I never get the things I want and generally things don’t work out for me but I used to have hope... I don’t know how to come back from this. 

I really just need everything to stop.

Have you ever wanted to go back in time? I always that was cheesy. Who would be so desperate to change things you know? But now that I’m desperate to change things....it’s not cheesy. It’s hell. 

Why didn’t I just listen to that voice. It told me to stay home and I didn’t listen. I was excited for an excuse to drink and eat junk food and now the last 6 years of my life are worthless. 

And I didn’t do anything wrong everyone around me was at fault but it doesn’t matter because at the end of the day it’s my life that’s ruined. My life had been irreversibly changed and nothing and no one will ever be able to fix it.

All these years I wasn’t angry but now I’m so full of resentment. 

I fantasize every night about death. In such a romantic way..I know it’s not healthy I know it’s not good but I won’t get help. 

I don’t care what happens to me any more. In fact I really hope I don’t wake up in the morning.
I wish I was never born. I’ve never thought that my entire life not when I was a pms ridden teenage girl but I really wish that now. I think my mother having me was a mistake. 

That’s so bizarre to feel this way in such a rational manner. My mom would have been better off things would have worked better for her and me if she hadn’t.

I’m just done with this all of this shit. 
I hate it all. If I knew then what I know now. I’d never bring him home.

I’d never trust anyone to love me enough to care about the things I want for my life so I can be happy. 
I’d never fall for the mistake of thinking that people cared. 

I didn’t listen to that voice and now that I know I should have....that voice just tells me to die.

58,"English is not my first languaje, so I apologize if this doesn't make that much sense.

I'm a F/18

I feel very lost and I don't know who I am anymore. Every time I get home from college, the only thing I can do is lay around looking at the void; I don't feel sad, but I am not happy either. I have made amazing friends in the last couple of months (It's my freshman year), but I was the lonely kid in highschool and sometimes I just want to be alone again (not because I enjoy it, rather, everytime I spend time with them I get a repetitive  thought that I don't belong there, or that I am bothering them)

When I was a kid, I used to self-harm and I remmember it being a big deal for me. It felt very wrong and I inmidiatly realized it was a bad coping mechanism, and eventually stopped doing it. In the past month I started hurting myself again but I feel nothing, not remorse, not sadness; still, I feel like I can't stop this time. In my mind it's Just a little phisical pain. But it just occured to me right now that maybe it is kind of not okay to feel that way?

I used to love school (specially maths and literature) but now I can barely solve basic ecuations. I think it's not as bad in other school subjects, but still, I space out in every one of them. Studying was the only thing I was good at, and seeing myself fail every single calculus test I have take this semester makes me feel a weird panic that it's always on my mind. I actually came with the conclusion that I'm stupidier than what I thought, but the things I can't solve are small, simple things that I want to think that I was able to respond in the past.

I have a hard time reading. When I open a book, my mind just goes blank. I also find very difficut to express myself while speaking (or writing), as if I spoke backwards or as if I couldn't put ideas togheter. I have tried studing in a lot of ways, but I struggle just getting to my desk and opening a book; that's another thing. I'm feel like I'm lazy and always leave things to the very last moment, and that is if I ever get to do things at all.

I don't know if my words carry the idea that I want to convey. Right now, I feel very empty and scared. Things happen aroud me but everything just seems far away. I just said that I don't feel sad, but I certainly feel like that in the moments when I notice my life is going to the garbage and I can't put it togheter by myself. I can't deal feeling this airheadness anymore.

It honestly pisses me off that some people wanna make it this kind of cool trend. I repeat it’s not fucking fun to live in this constant state of anxiety, I remember few months ago when I was dating my ex she got us tickets to go to a concert. I remember the week of the concert the anxiety really started to kick in. As the days got closer my mind kept playing different anxiety induced scenarios. I was freaking out and trying to calm myself down but nothing was working. My mind was racing so fast that I tried meditating and doing breathing methods but I couldn’t concentrate cause of my anxiety and it got worse. The day of I couldn’t eat anything leading up to the concert, I remember her picking me up and being in the car and on the verge of vomiting. I remember trying to hold it in so hard, I started breathing hard and shaking. I couldn’t even speak cause if I tried I knew I was probably going to puke. Once the concert started I was fine cause I was just focusing on the band that I loved playing live in front of my eyes but leading up to it was not fun. I don’t get how someone could think experiencing that is fun and cool.

It's always on my mind. my definition of an eccentric is an eccentric is : ""a lunatic. A crazy person. But not just any crazy person. Someone who is not depressed. The third most common mental illness after eating and anxiety is depression. An eccentric is a lunatic who is not depressed or has excessive anxiety or eating disorder.""

I am not depressed. Nor do I have an eating disorder. on average. I barely remember even getting here as I am wasted. Nearly 12 shots is equivocal to what  I have drank. I remember what I thought bit not the steps. 

Not depressed. As far as I know. I will  schedule an appointment. 

But as an average I am happy and want to improve the happiness of others. I am odd  aloof, and struggle to understand the minds of other apart from the body language and language of others. Emotions are strange and  foreign to me. My emotional understanding is almost nonexistent. 

I am happy but  want to love someone else. And that is the only thing that holds me back. Really. If I had a girl friend most of my problems would go away. I am not an incel. I am a firm believer of running bear foot and watch this video to understand my view of all this

Point is compatibility is all I struggle with. And I don't if am eccentric I or have some sort of mental deficiency.

That really took a toll on me and at this point i find myself staring at my ceiling at night thinking about things like if she really did like me or if that was just her way of ""putting me down easy"", or if i really was that terrible to have multiple people tell me all of that, and at this point i dont know what to do.

66,"After watching the movie Joker it was hard not to see how much it mirrored reality for so many people. Particularly for those who feel rejected and beaten down by a broken system and society. 

The film portrayed society supporting him in dealing with his feelings of the broken system. His violence was due a sense of hopelessness and rejection in order to bring some sort of personal justice.

This made me wonder if the recent senseless knife crimes are also a way of the youth trying to show how broken they feel. Perhaps also feeling a sense of hopelessness to the current situation?

Trigger warning!!!!

So almost a month ago I gathered the strength to report childhood sexual abuse. I don’t know what I was expecting but the experience was.. pretty tough. Through the interview I kinda kept saying “umm” between like every word, but I didn’t think anything of it. Then after I didn’t say anything until I got back in the car, when I tried speaking I had a horrible stutter.

The stutter has continued since. It’s so bad that it takes me close to three minutes to finish a simple sentence. I’ve chosen to stop speaking completely. Being that I live at home my parents know what’s going on and I’ve chosen to tell 2 other very close family meme era however most everyone is in the dark (including my younger sister who also lives at home). 

I keep saying I lost my voice but I don’t know how much longer people are going to believe me. I mostly feel fine but not being able to communicate efficiently is getting more and more frustrating/difficult emotionally. I’m trying my best I just don’t know what else to do right now.",16Oct2019,1
69,"A little background before I (27F) begin. I'm from a country where mental health is still a pretty taboo subject. Families here are very close knit and my first cousins are almost like my siblings. I live away from my aunts and uncles (as do my parents) but they live in one big joint family with my wonderful grandmother. My sibling and all my cousins have moved out - either for work or because they  got married, except for one who I'll call A. 

I liked A in the past (it's...hard now) and having dealt with my own depression, know what it's like to be mentally unwell. She's in her early 30s now bright and smart, went to the US for university on scholarship. But ever since she came back to India, she's been...off. My whole family is concerned. 

She has no friends left. She talks to maybe a handful of people she works with. She is always angry. I can almost feel the bitterness seeping off her body. She never smiles anymore, is extremely irritable. She's under a LOT of pressure from her parents to get married (mainly so she'll move out). They're constantly telling her to lost weight (she's might be like - 2 kilos overweight. Negligible. she's really just fine the way she is). They don't ever leave her alone, which is really unhealthy. I'm pretty sure they've unwittingly caused and exacerbated whatever she's going through. 

She even rented an apartment once when she had some success as a freelancer, rented it for 6 months but never moved there! She just stayed at home. i've spoken to her about all of this, gave her the number of many therapists. We used to have lots of conversations where she felt trapped by the house and the family (which is a little irrational because she does have the freedom to leave, even if her parents whine and complain, they can't stop her if she tries hard enough. It's something all the girls have dealt with but yes, it isn't easy. Standards are just different for men and women here unfortunately and the injustice consumes her.) 

She got significantly worse after her brother got married (they've always been compared by the parents as kids. She was considered a nerd and her brother was and is really popular). She never wants to be around family, it feels like she hates us - but she's always there! Like someone has forced her. The worst part is that recently i feel like she feels joy when something bad happens to any of us. She laughs manically if someone is hurt. A lot of her reactions feel manic and extreme in fact. Like she'll say something really mean, but then laugh like crazy at a really serious event like a funeral. Takes joy in riling people up. Her humor is *mean*. She works part-time in the social work space and enjoys making everyone around her feel guilty for not doing enough for society. She posts angry things on facebook about how people don't understand her but insults other peoples opinions and implies that they're immoral, or frivolous or stupid. 

I feel like she might be depressed (?) but I don't know. I want to help. I know something is wrong but I can't put my finger on it and she snaps if I mention doctors now so i've backed off. What can I do? How can we help?",16Oct2019,1

My girlfriend moved to the same college as me (she is year younger), I joined an organization and have met let’s of friends and I’m enjoying myself.

74,"Good morning everyone. My main problem is b that since I turned 12 I’ve become increasingly more conscious of the feelings and emotional stability of those in my life and yet not my own. I personally have not been diagnosed with a mental health disorder but was accidentally told at a young age,as I get older I may start to acquire those that my mother suffers from. Because I’ve seen first hand what the disorders do as well as the medication does to and for her,I’ve always strayed clear of seeing a therapist/psychologist. But I digress,the problems I see myself face the most are the feelings of a paralyzing numbness in times when my emotional response is needed. An example was just recently I attended a funeral service for a member of my family who had committed suicide,I never personally met the individual but he was close enough to my parents that it warranted our attendance. Everyone was sobbing uncontrollably and overall I felt like I should be sad yet at the same time felt like I was outside of my own body,there in the third person. I’m not familiar at all with the terminology at all but those that I’ve told about it told me I’m “disassociating” but you me the word goes in one ear and out the other. As I sat in the pew I felt no remorse nor and sympathy for those genuinely affected.

I lie when someone calls me out on something, just to brush it off to make it look like I haven't done anything bad. 

I get triggered when I lose, and then I blame it on anything else, just not me. 

It ruins my day and it ruins my buddy's day when we lose and I get triggered, become not talkative and blame stuff on anything but me. These things obviously translate to real world, not just games. Even when we hang out, I can't admit my stupidity and fault.

I know these things are happening, and I want to change them, I just can't willingly force myself to enjoy things as they are. That's what triggeres me the most. I know I am a terrible person, but I can't change it. I know I should improve, not lie, get better and practice.

From time to time I watch people play games and they are cheerful even if they lose, if they perform poorly. I can't do that even when I know I should. 

I am confused as I don't know how to be like them. I don't want to be grumpy and annoying guy. I want to enjoy things.

We all share a commonality here, we've all felt broken beyond repair, and we have all known what's like to feel utterly defeated. We know pain that is unlike the pain that we hear others complain about so casually. Everyday doubt fills us repeatedly while anger and remorse are always one misstep away. So quick to blow up and so quick to give in to our deepest fears.

Yet we are so incredibly strong and we fight to understand what makes us feel powerless. We fight so that we can see a brighter tomorrow. While those around us bask within the illusion of a happiness that they have not earned we work our hands to the bone for a true happiness, one that can wither all illusions. 
Joy and pain are cut from the same branch, just as light and darkness only exist within each other. The deepest of pain will reward the greatest of bliss. Although our scars will never heal they have taught us of the intensity that we posses.
Focus your intensity within. Single out your fears. Single out your desires. And know that change is always one step away. We are the ones who will change the world for the better, we are not crazy, we are not mad... we are the dreamers, dont let the weight of those who have failed before stop you from succeeding.

85,"The Big Drill have recently started a Podcast and in this Episode Ghazi and Will drill into the recent film ‘Joker’

It’s a semi review and our own feelings around the film in general, cinematography, acting, script and score. 

However, added to this is the connection that this film has with mental health and illness. 

We discuss opinions on how we think it portrays certain aspects of mental health and society. Is it accurate, is it effective, does it have a point and is it responsible? 

Its been divisive and we aim to give the balanced perspective we always try to do through honest and open discussion. 

Is Joker just a film of violence and atrocities, born to entertain the comic fandom or are there in fact deeper more woven meanings into the film to wake the masses and fuel the fire that's burning under the movement of mental health in a possibly broken society. 

We realise that some of the topics we discuss are sensitive, if we lighten the mood with any comical references or swear in places its only carried out with positive intent and passion. 

We have another episode where we speak on mental health awareness and had to make another episode after seeing the Joker movie if you're interested here are the links:

86,"What I read about double depression fits pretty much exactly my experience of the past years. But from what I read it's usually a dysthimia that evolves, not the other way around. In my case however it's the opposit. I have never been depressed before, then my first major episode came and since I've been oscillating. I don't have manic phases, I oscillate between depressed and more depressed, and the oscillations are not (always) correlated with the treatment attempts.",16Oct2019,2
87,"I’m not okay.

I don’t want to be here. I cry every single day on the bus to school. I HATE school so so much. Even thinking about going to school makes me cry. I have no friends. I sit with a group of people but truely I don’t think their my friends. The only time I talk to them is like an hour a day. Never outside of school. I have No social life. I can’t remember the last time I was happy or enjoyed going out and too school.

It feels like no cares about me. At schooI all the teachers hate me, I don’t like my friends, I never get invited anywhere. 

I have panic attacks really late at night and can’t even breathe. I barely sleep and am exhausted the whole day. 

I’m so insecure about my about and hate going out in public. I’m going through binge eating disorder at the moment and it’s really hard. I’m gained so much weight. Because of this I only wear big clothes and long pants and long sleeves.
People at my work have called me fat multiple times which really hurts. Even my own mum.  

I don’t participate in anything at school which makes teachers mad and hate me. They just think I’m lazy. I don’t complete my work or do assignments. 

I self harmed a couple times and now there’s big scars that are still red and I’m scared if someone sees them so I can’t even wear short sleeves and the weathers getting hotter.

It feels like everyday I’m drowning in myself and I can’t talk to anyone about it. 

It’s so hard to even get out of bed in the morning, that’s why I’m late so often. 

Each day just gets worse and worse even when I try my best to fake my happiness. I have anger problems and am rude and mean for no reason. I get triggered easily and set off by the smallest things. My mood changes so fast. Each day I tell myself that it’s now time to tell someone because things are getting bad but I just can’t do it. It tears me up thinking about how depressed I’ve gotten and how much my life has changed. I don’t go anywhere other than school or work ever. I wish for one day I could just go outside and not be afraid of what people will think and say. 

The best way I could describe is that I hate the world. 

I haven’t posted on social media in over a year because I hate the way I look and have no life. I stopped texting all my friends... and lost them.

No one knows that I feel this way. Not my twin sister, not my best friend, not my parents, not my “friends” at school, none of my teachers and no one at work. I feel so trapped right now but I know I need to tell someone.",16Oct2019,1
88,"I've been ill for weeks. My doctor's upped my dose of mirtazapine and it's made me worse. 

I'm constantly flat, depressed, fed up, irritable and so on. 

I'm just sick of feeling this way. I know something isn't right and I've told the doctors so many times and they won't listen. I'm going to make them listen today. I don't care what it takes. I need them to listen. 

I don't want to feel this way anymore. I don't want to live like this anymore. I'm getting suicidal thoughts but I know I won't act on them. I'm just sick of it. 

I want to be able to love my job, watching TV and gaming again. I'm just so sick and tired of feeling this way.",16Oct2019,2
89,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first post in Reddit, I thought that sharing my situation could help me (and maybe some of you guys as well?). I'm not thinking I can find answers or thinking models here - although really appreciated! - , but it would be nice to hear if some of you have the same feelings. A bit of background: I'm a man in my thirties from Central Europe, come from a good family (in my opinion at least, parents divorced though when I was 15), have an education, a loving wife, great and well-paid job, and a lots of friends. So everything is ok at the surface.  


But under the surface I'm a total mess. I have been having lots of fears during my life, like fear of vomiting, fear of darkness, fear of having different diseases etc. These fears have been coming and going for some past 20 years, but since the age 12 I have been having fear of dying. It's weird to explain: one part of me has always planned for the future (let's say that in high school planning to which university I want to apply), while one part of me can't think that far to the future, feeling like can't believe that I'm alive on that time. This fear is sometimes stronger and sometimes lighter, but it has always been in the background.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a psychiatrist last Spring and visited also a therapist for a few times. I was diagnosed with mild anxiety disorder and depression, which I could see to come. Most of the summer went similar than it has been, but now within a past month something has snapped in my head and my thinking has changed. I'm thinking death constantly, actively and passively, and the thought of losing consciousness for good is so damn sad, paralyzing, and unbelievable that I just can't handle the idea. I have been also thinking like what's the point of living, because eventually it's coming to an end. I can enjoy and have some good feelings when I'm doing something that really needs concentration and doesn't let my thoughts wander, or modifies my thoughts (like video games, sports, sex, drinking alcohol). But basically during everything else I'm in really deep waters, and of course I can't do these things which bring me satisfaction all the time. And I really can't see the point even doing things I enjoy, because those only bring momentarily satisfaction, and a present for a small moment. I can't take those with me when I die. I'm thinking it would be easier just to die now, because that's going to happen at some point. And at the same time I'm very scared of dying. Please share me your thoughts and feelings!",16Oct2019,3

93,"The world is not more than the cell of solitary confinement, of all seven billion of us not even one mere to care for me individually, and if so will process selfishly.  
People are so predicable and sometime shallow, it amazes me when they only ever interact to me solely by borrowing one of my items, and rarely greetings.

94,"I've always struggled to be a very motivated person. I have never been the super well adjusted type who has their shit in order. Though during my late teens and early twenties I developed certain tricks to get myself to do the hard/unpleasant/boring things that need to get done. I've had therapy before in my life and I'm currently getting therapy again.

I used to be able to blunt force myself into doing things I ""didn't feel like doing""(that was mostly fatigue and depression). Throughout the years I've accumulated enough experience and introspective ability to know what I should be doing and how to get myself out of depression or temporary dips. What thought patterns, behaviors and unhealthy things I should steer clear of. Basically I KNOW very well what to do. I just can't fucking get myself to do it. Not anymore. I can sit in a corner where a part of me is literally screaming in my head that I should go to my kickboxing class for example. It's good for me, the exercise keeps a lot of shit away, it gets my messy thoughts in order, and I always feel better after. Yet another part of me bogs me down and just sandbags every effort in doing what I should be doing for self betterment.

This happens very often in all kinds of scenarios. and I've grown resentful towards myself. I know that doesn't help, and now is not the time to hate myself, but I feel weak and useless all the time. I feel like I've fallen back to my dumbass teenager times and all my years of self development have now only led to one thing : I'm doing the same dumb shit as years ago, but now I KNOW I'm being an idiot, yet I feel powerless to stop it.

The whole ""just do it"" aproach has stopped working, reasoning with myself is useless, beating myself up over it doesn't help and I don't know what to do anymore. I've had medication before(10mg lexapro for social anxiety) , but that also had a lot of side effects, and I don't know if I'm ready to do the whole ""I will now spend months/years of going through different medications and possibly disastrous side effects to find one that works for me, just to realize that in the end it doesn't really help at all, and just creates it's own myriad of different issues"".

Sorry for my pessimism. I'm pretty sure there are people experiencing similar issues out there, so I was hoping if any of you had some advice.",16Oct2019,9

96,"So like any other depressed person in this world, I pretend that I'm not so that I wouldn't ""offend"" People around me. Whenever I can't hide my depression people notice but mistake my depression for being stuck up or just having a bad attitude which is not the case. I hate how misjudged I am. I get flirted on a lot by people of all ages. Especially at my current job, there's a lot of older men like in their 40s that I can tell have a thing for me (I'm 25) and I'm only interested in men close my age. But anyways they flirt with me and I pretend to be happy. I acknowledge my mental health issues and because of that I avoid falling into relationships because I'm afraid that if a man were to find out about my depression they'd find me a bother or that I'm weird. I also kinda have social anxiety which doesn't help anything else. But does anyone else deal with a mental health issue and being flirted on or trying to avoid relationships in general?",16Oct2019,20

They're on my father's side who passed away a few years ago and I only see them maybe 2 or 3 times a year but I still feel guilty for making big decisions and I even feel the need to warn them before hand to offset some of the possible backlash from them.

98,"I was giving support to my SO, going to her psychiatrist with her. And the experience there was entirely different then what I was accustomed to with my own experience with mental health issues.

 First there were no vitals taken, although I assume this is mostly uncommon for mental helath. Then we got to speak to a medical student, which I guess isn't too different from having a nurse go through the initial questions.  They dont do any substantial tracking of symptom severity, like PHQ-9 or GAD-7. They ask subjective questions, which certainly makes tracking symptoms very difficult, as well as the fact they use paper instead of electronic systems. 


Then after waiting for roughly 30 minutes the psychiatrist came in, my S.O. has been with this doctor for 6 years and is in dire need of a reevaluation, with many new symptoms coming up.

 The doctor quite literally asked four things: How are your symptoms, do you want new Medication, what insurance do you have (becomes more relevant later), and do you need refills. The roughly 10 minutes he spent in there with her were absolutely ridiculous, he didn't seem to give any shit about her new symptoms, or her at all. 

He gave her a sample of latuda (2nd gen anti psychotics). which definitely lit up red lights, doctors giving samples means they are being lobbied usually, the doctor did get payments from the company for roughly 331 USD in 2018, they were his 2nd biggest lobbyist. (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov)  

Btw the reason he asked her about insurance is that the cash price for 30 days of latuda is 1400 USD. With insurance obviously less. But the sample of 14 days, she was given, is litteraly 650USD. 

He didn't go over the risks of latuda, which if you have ever taken 2nd gen psychotics, are often not pleasant, and can have serious effects. He spend like 10 minutes with her, and generally showed no sign of caring, or trying to figure out anything.


His solution consisted of giving her an anti psychotic, instead of figuring out what is currently troubling her the most and how to best adjust her medications. Which is the exact opposite of what was done for me when I went on a 2nd gen anti psychotic, my psychiatrist really highlighted the negatives of them, and stated the only reason why he feels comfortable with this medication being correct was because I had plans for suicide. 


She is switching to a new provider as soon as possible, and if they diagnose an issue he failed to diagnose, we will be filing a complaint with the state medical board.",16Oct2019,2
99,"Hello everyone, first of all, I apologize if I'm in the wrong place.

I have a friend, she suffers from depression, anxiety, ptsd and suicidal ideation. I would like to help her when she needs it and the only thing she really told me was that she's a very emotional person and that whenever she's going through something difficult, a very stressful situation for example, that If I wanted to help, to take control and emotionally lead her. The only problem here is, that I'm at a complete loss as to what exactly that means or entails.

100,"So I've been trying to get to this point for 15 years. Despite how tough today was, it's a relief to finally be here. 
I can finally start to pin point my triggers, what caused them in the first place, and eventually start a plan of action of how I will confront these demons and beat them

I know way down the line, exposure therapy is probably something I'll have to do. My main problem is my severe anxiety. My depression mainly is provoked and made worse by my anxiety and triggers. But as the psychologist said, if I tried to expose myself to my triggers before we do the talking leg work, it'll just be torture with no good outcome. 

My main goal is to be able to go out in public without having lots of panic attacks. To be able to speak to people, without being paranoid. To be able to see friends, and trust them. To be able to work, and not have panic attacks slow me down.  To be able to finally breathe when outside of the safety of my room. To be able to breathe and feel safe even within my room when my anxiety is that bad that everything is a danger.

I just want to be able to go about life more easily. Even if I can't get rid of all of it, any improvements would make life 1000x better than it has been.

I've been a loner, a recluse. I've turned down so many social events it's unreal. Always using I'm tired, I'm in pain or I feel bad from meds as an excuse
 Simply because I cannot deal with having a never ending panic attack for multiple hours in a row, all whilst trying to hide them. Then having to ask my boyfriend if we can go because I'm in pain or tired, simply because it's getting that bad I'll be unable to hide my panic attack any longer. 

Hopefully over the next however long, I'll finally be able to talk about my past and present, and with her find some way to move forward and deal with it all. 

I want to be better. I want to feel like myself.  I want to be the best I can be, but I need to unload this baggage in order to make progress. I'm ready to be helped and to help myself. No more waiting. No more limbo. Only me, my therapist and my amazing boyfriend being there afterwards for support. 

I've got this. Finally. I'm finally en route to the better place. I'm under no illusion this will be easy. But it sure has to be easier than ehat I've dealt with so far",16Oct2019,1

102,"Well so, I've been suffering from anxiety and depression about one year and am now (it's about 2 months I know it) diagnosed with borderline. Sometimes I have weird episodes, like today, I started feeling a lot of anger aftet I cried because of a basic simple well known existential crisis. I felt like I needed to destroy something so I just kept punching and kicking the walls and floor of my school's bathroom. Then I was just super hyperactive and oversensitive and loud and kept laughing, I thought I calmed down but it came back a few minutes later. My friend who's always here for me got super scared (I guess it was scary to see yeah).

same with groceries shopping i know i need to go and do this thing and i want to go and do this thing but i have to fight my self so much to do them that some day i just don't have the energy to do so.

106,"My (21M) girlfriend (21F) and I have been dating for almost a year. She is my first girlfriend and being a virgin, I was looking for someone who matched my level of innocence. I got with her thinking she was completely innocent (one of the qualities I was looking for), not having done anything sexual before. She had one ex, which I did know about, but one day she confessed to me that he fingered her. It hurt me and wasn’t something I wanted to hear, but ever since then, it’s made me paranoid about her past. I constantly question her asking if there’s any other thing that her ex had done to her, asking for very specific details of what he’s done and how, and she always tells me that there was nothing else. I believe everything she’s telling me, and knowing her, she has no reason to lie. Yet, I still have a very hard time trusting her, and questions of her past bother me every single day.

TL;DR: I can’t get over my girlfriend’s past and I’m not able to fully trust her. It’s been bothering me everyday for 6 months, and to be clear, I really don’t want to break up with her. I need advice for how to accept her past and stop questioning everything about it.",16Oct2019,0

She’s extremely possessive and manipulative, saying things like “you’re not going to leave me”, “you’re staying with me and take care for me, that’s why I gave birth to you”, “you’re not moving out, even if you go to university”, saying it’s my fault when it comes to her mood swings or when it isn’t even about me, not caring how I feel and saying that my emotions don’t matter and degrading me, for example calling me retarded for not wearing the shoes she wanted me to wear. I used to go to a therapist but she immediately took mother’s side and said that I’m not mentally ill and just on my period (yes, she literally said that, I’m not joking). Now it’s getting worse, she thinks I’m addicted to the internet and says I should socialize more, but doesn’t let me talk to my friends online which is the only way of communicating with them right now. I consider suicide a lot more now and I don’t know if I’m going to be alive til the end of the month.

Last night when asking her if she wanted dinner, she was on her bed, eyes open wide, taking incredibly shallow breaths, she had cut herself on her throat and thighs, and smeared the blood on her face. I really wish I was making this up. She seemed calm but very... void? I got my mom and we all sat and talked (and cried) and slowly she came back to normal. She said she gets like that when she’s feeling really bad, referring to it as an “episode”, she said mentioned feeling nauseous and fixated on suicide during these episodes.

Everyone at our lunch table is a minor btw, so we said maybe to take a break from dating for just a little bit but she didn't care.

So I talk to her today and why we are all worried that she is just dating another jerk but she yells it's my life I can mess it up if I want. I don't know what to do, I emailed a teacher without telling her all this for her last name to report her or something but like sometimes they don't really do anything and all.

My (18F) boyfriend (33M) was the kindest soul ever minus a few kinks when we first met.

Fast forward two months in the relationship, we live together (his idea) and we even own a cat. But he's not the same. He's hot and cold and hot and cold. He'll get mad at me for talking too much and threaten to break up with me, and the next day he'll say that I'm mad at him cause I'm not talking and he doesn't like my attitude. One second he doesn't want me to talk about my job because I ""drain his energy"", the second he's going off chattering about what happened at work and I don't know how to react. He'll get bouts where he isolates himself for days and get really aggressive if I do ANYTHING to bother him, and then he'll get all loving and cuddly and tell me he loves me. He's never been physically abusive but has says quite a lot of stuff that hurt me. He also doesn't tell me when stuff bugs him, he'll just bring it up like a week later and explode, and when I've asked him to let me know when things bother him the second they do, he gets offended and says I should just ""know"".

I can’t stop texting him throughout the day multiple times like a crazy person and for some reason it give me relief? I’ve deleted all social media I don’t give a fuck what’s happening in others lives. I can’t listen to music with words because it all makes me think of him. I can’t eat anything and if I do it immediately feels like it’s going to come back up. I have been sent home from work twice now and they told me to take the rest of the week off and get some help because I just can’t stop crying. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I genuinely can’t live like this anymore. To me it either feels like kill myself or try to help myself and check myself into the hospital. I can not and will not continue to live like this. I can’t bear it at all. It’s so excruciatingly painful. I am so scared to go to the hospital. I’ve never been and I’m terrified. Does it help? What should I expect? Please help. I’m seeing my therapist tomorrow then going to check myself in after.,16Oct2019,2

120,"# Habits of the Rich that Mimic Good Mental Health Habits.

I saw an article about Thomas C. Corley, titled  “17 Habits of Self-Made Millionaires”, who spent 5 years studying 177 self-made rich people. I don’t know why it took him 5 years to do this but I’d read his book, “Change Your Habits, Change Your Life” a few years ago when it was the rage, so I read this article. This took me a bit longer to write up and condense it for you than I planned but I think/hope it is worth it.

I was struck by the habits that Corley claims are almost universal among the very rich because they are excellent mental health practices. Here they are. I wonder how many you practice now and how many you’d entertain starting to use on a daily basis?

1. **They consistently read.**  
The rich would [rather be educated than entertained](http://www.businessinsider.com/rich-people-like-to-read-2015-8).  
88% of rich people ""devote thirty minutes or more each day to self-education or self-improvement reading"". ""The rich read to acquire or maintain knowledge,"" he said.Corley found that they tended to read three types of books: biographies of successful people, self-help or personal development books, and history books.
2. **They exercise.**  
""Seventy-six percent of the rich aerobically exercise 30 minutes or more every day,"" Corley said. ""Cardio is not only good for the body, but it's good for the brain,"" he wrote. ""It grows the neurons (brain cells) in the brain."" He added: ""Exercise also increases the production of glucose. Glucose is brain fuel. The more fuel you feed your brain, the more it grows and the smarter you become.""
3. **They hang with other successful people.**  
""You are only as successful as those you frequently associate with,"" Corley wrote. ""The rich are always [on the lookout for individuals who are goal-oriented](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-friendships-affect-wealth-2015-7), optimistic, enthusiastic, and who have an overall positive mental outlook.""
4. **They volunteer.**  
To surround themselves with the above good people, many self-made millionaires turn to charity.  
""This is why so many wealthy people volunteer for charitable organizations, civic groups, or trade groups. It helps them expand their network of other success-minded people,"" he wrote.  
Of the millionaires he studied, 72% volunteered five hours or more every month.
5. **They define their ideal lives.**  
61% did this by imagining all their dreams coming true and then writing them down in around 500 words with the steps necessary to make that happen.
6. **They pursue their own goals rather than what is expected of them.**  
And that is where they find their passion, energy, and drive.
7. **They sleep at least 7 hours a night.**  
Sleep accomplishes so many things - repair and memory formation to name only two.
8. **They get up early.**  
Nearly 50% of the self-made millionaires in Corley's study said they woke up at least three hours before their workday actually began. It's a strategy to deal with inevitable daily disruptions, such as a meeting that went too long, egregious traffic, or having to pick up your sick kid from school.  
""These disruptions have a psychological effect on us. They can drip into our subconscious and eventually form the belief that we have no control over our life,"" Corley wrote. ""Getting up at five in the morning to tackle the top three things you want to accomplish in your day allows you to regain control of your life. It gives you a sense of confidence that you, indeed, direct your life.""
9. **They have multiple sources of income.**  
65% reported their goal was at least 3 streams of income and they created them before they attained their first million dollars.
10. **They find and check in with mentors.**  
Find a mentor that puts you on a fast track with advice, wisdom and contacts.
11. **They help others succeed.**  
Only help those who are positive and goal-oriented b/c you must spend your time wisely.
12. **They are positive.**  
""If you stop to listen to your thoughts, to be aware of them, you'd find most of them are negative,"" he wrote. ""But you only realize you are having these negative thoughts when you force yourself to be aware of them. Awareness is the key."" This is where CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is so useful.
13. **They don’t follow the herd.**  
They don’t conform to what others are doing or thinking and don’t worry about gossip.
14. **They practice good etiquette.**  
Critical to success, they reported, was sending thank-you notes, acknowledging important life events such as a wedding or a birthday, eating politely and using table manners, and dressing properly for various social events. Anytime someone mentions their birthday, add it to your calendar to call or send a note next year.
15. **They dedicate 15-30 minutes a day to just thinking.**
16. **They seek feedback.**  
They do not fear criticism because it is essential to understand what might not be on the right track.
17. **They never give up.**  
Enough said.

121,"Sorry for any typos and formatting errors, I am a nervous wreck right now.

I had to take a short term leave of absence from my job due to my increasing anxiety and worsening symptoms of bipolar disorder. My performance was tanking in a really bad way. The good news is my employer recognizes the validity of mental health and allows up to 5 months paid time off to get things straightened out. The bad news is they run claims through Sedgwick, and the worse news is Sedgwick is a nightmare to deal wit. They require all mental health claims get signed by a psychiatrist. I see a nursing assistant of psychiatry, so her credentials are no good. After weeks of begging I was finally told my therapist/psychiatrist office would help. The forms get sent over and to my surprise they weren't correct signed. So I had to go back and ask them to re-do it. Only this time I was told the attending psychiatrist refused to help me. So their only help, 2 days before the due date, was to call around or force myself back early despite have zero time to focus on recovery. So I called every psychiatrist in a 50 mile radius and the earliest is maybe two weeks. I called my psychiatrist office back this morning practical begging and they still said it was office policy. They insisted I go inpatient, ignoring the fact they are essentially costing me my job and livihood because of their misleading tactics and have made my anxiety much worse. I ended up having a nervous  breakdown talking to my parents they had get the police to do a wellness check
I even looked into telemedicine, but I can't get a guarantee I can be of the proper health without spending $300. 

Does anyone know a board certified psychiatrist in the middle Tennessee area or anyone over telemedicine that can sign off on short term disability? I can get all case notes from my therapist and psychiatrist office  to support my diagnosis. I know I can get through these issues, but with possible unemployment and homelessness looming I am going to continue to worsen.",16Oct2019,2
122,"I got pressured into leaving my job a year ago while going through a anxiety and another physical condition that was feeding into my anxiety (extreme fatigue). I used this time to look into the condition with my doctor and go for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy which did a help.

3 Months ago a few friends completely turned on me and cut all contact with me, people who i trusted strongly. Which made me fall back into my anxiety and i feel like i'm back to where i was when i left my job. Unfortunately one of these people works around the corner from where i live so i can't avoid them. I sometimes avoid going out because of this.

I feel like i'm constantly taking 1 step forward and 30 steps back.

So i'm stuck doing nothing, i can't see a full time job working out with my anxiety and condition. I've looked into part-time and i can't find anything in my area. I honestly don't really know what to do, i'm currently on benefits (ESA) which is barely making ends meet. (26 Male, Living alone). It terrifies me to make new friends or get a job after these experiences. If i make a new friend i'll just get hurt, if i get a job the same thing will happen.

124,"I think  there is way too much to actually write to cover everything so Im going to just cover what I can broadly then answer questions as they come up.

When I was very little I remember not understanding why people react to things the way they do and I remember reacting incorrectly a lot and so unless I knew how to react, I didn't. I also found this to be easier at times because it made people leave me alone and that was all the better. By highschool I had everything down pat, moved schools and became popular with ease. I have always been adeptly keen at manipulating people to recieve the desired outcome that benefits myself most and I've been able to Chameleon myself in a sense to fit different social settings. 

I don't remember feeling the following at any point in time:
Guilt
Emotional Remorse (Cognitive Remorse I have;  understanding logically that I hurt somebody in my inner circle and choosing to avoid doing those things again)
Empathy, Im still not entirely sure what Empathy is but I think I understand it logically. I can logically place myself in somebodies situationand determine their emotional reaction but I certainly don't feel anything. 
""Love""

From 18-22 I experimented with drugs heavily. Coke  was my favorite. I also experimented sexually. The number one turn on for me was being being seen as sexually desirable by whoever I was with. 

After I quit partying and experimenting I got tired/bored of it and joined the Marines. I didn't like it so I got out after I did my time. I met my wife and everything got weird. For the first time in my life I felt what could be love and a few years later guilt (idk maybe not. I felt sick to my stomach about things I had done to her and it made me change my course of actions to ensure I never lost her and could be the person she needed me to be). I genuinely placed her before myself in all situations. 

I took a Job at a prison. Lots of people let their emotions control them. Ive never understood it. I definately dont feel strongly enough to ever let how I feel dictate my actions. I have 0 anxiety issues and have never found ""grotesque"" things to bother me.  I quit the Prison Job after a few months and started up in Real Estate. I have been exceptionally succesful thus far. People are easy to read for me.

Still Ive never felt as though Ive experienced true remorse or guilt. I tend to think highly of myself in some aspects. I am not struggling but I am aware that my lack of emotion is not the norm and I wonder if I were diagnosed and medicated if I could FEEL like others do. I would consider myself happy but also wary of myself. I have been extreme before and am aware if I dont place certain controls in my life I could act impulsively and have negative repercussions.",16Oct2019,1

126,"This is my first post on this and sort of need to get this off my chest. Ever see the picture of spongebob sitting on his own with a cup of coffee Looking all down and upset. Yeah that’s me writing this message. A character that is always smiling and laughing and loving life completely alone and sad. I’ve these periods of anxiety and depression that I can’t seem to escape and always seem to end up right back in the same situations again and again no matter how many times I try to avoid negative thoughts and just generally good vibes. Worst part is anyone I talk to about these things just can’t seem to take it seriously, even when I talked to my friends it became a joke to them. I want a change of scene but I can’t escape where I am it seems. I’m scared to go for professional help mainly because I can’t afford a therapist and generally just have a fear of talking about this in case it blows up in my face.

127,"Lately I've been depressed. In an attempt to define myself... I've lost myself. I'm uncertain what I want out of life because I've been so focused on what I don't want. Like a wiki page character description, I've spent the past few years trying to neatly box myself into a label\[s\] through personality quizzes or comparisons to fictional characters.

The other day I read this quote: ""Depression is your body saying, ‘I don’t want to be this character anymore. I don’t want to hold up this avatar that you’ve created in the world. It’s too much for me.' You should think of the word ‘depressed’ as ‘deep rest.’ Your body needs to be depressed. It needs deep rest from the character you’ve been trying to play.” - Jim Carrey

It made me wonder if perhaps this is the root cause of my fluctuating depression for the past few years. I believe my goal for this past few years has been to live as somewhat of a character so that I'd have a clearly defined path for me to follow. The problem, however, has been that this ""path"" has still been obscured, making me walk in circles.

131,I do not really fear the thoughts of being gay. Instead I am more consumed with what if I am actually faking and could be straight. So when people ask if I am gay it’s like I cannot fully admit that I am because I have this uncertainty. Ever since middle school I have noticed guys. During puberty when I first started masturbating I thought of guys. In high school I thought other guys were attractive and a few girls (not sure if it was sexual attraction though). And I have made out and cuddle and done other things with guys...it did not make me feel bad or weird. Last time I was cuddling night with a guy the whole time I wondered and obsessed if I was actually into it. Therefor I could not get turned on.

136,"Warning: wall of text, but I desperately want someone to care

I'm an 18-year-old male from Russia who only plays video games all the time and sometimes reads fantasy books. For most of my life my only interest was aforementioned video games and reading, but for a year now I've been thinking of writing my own fantasy book. I take a long time to fall asleep, so I use that time to think about stuff, and for this past year I've been developing my novel. Right now I have the characters, the plot and the world mostly fleshed out all in my head(and at this point I have 2 more core concepts for 2 more books) just from thinking about it while falling asleep, but I've yet to write a word of this novel, since I can't bring myself to write at all. I would rather just play video games and procrastinate.

I've tried enrolling into a university, but I almost failed my biology exam(38/100, you fail if you get less than 36/100) since I haven't prepared for it **at all** and I wasn't accepted(to which my reaction was something along the lines of ""Whatever"") despite having my other exam results ranging from fairly decent to very good(96/100 for my English exam). Thus, my parents and I decided that I'll re-take the biology exam next year and try to enroll in the same university. That's all well and good, but I still haven't studied biology after almost half a year since that decision was made and I'm afraid the cycle is just going to repeat itself.

Apart from studying biology, my mom wanted me to find a job for the year, and I respect that, but my family basically had to find a job *for me* because while I wasn't opposed to the idea of getting a job, I was not interested in actually looking for one. I ended up working in a small marketing company of my sister's husband, doing odd jobs on the computer like translating things or adding stuff to the company websites for a pretty meager pay while I'm on probation(and I'm still on probation after 1,5 months, not sure when will it end).

How do I feel about my work? Well, let's just say that the best part of it was buying an almost new high-end GPU for a very cheap price from my colleague. The work itself is largely boring, easy, repetitive and I don't like it. It's not a bad job, and it's way better than working at a fastfood joint or something like that, but it's not for me and I can barely bring myself to actually work instead of browsing Reddit or something similar all the time since I have basically no supervision. I'm considering quitting my job and at least trying to use all the free time to do something productive like writing or studying. I'm just not sure if I'm going to be able to make myself do that. There has already been times when I said to myself something along the lines of ""I'm going to do it tommorow for sure. No bullshit. I'm going to go and make myself do it"" and never did anything, feeling like a lazy piece of shit afterwards.

Lastly, my mother developed serious health issues and had them for over a year now. It started as a problem with her digestive system but quickly spiraled into many things that I couldn't keep track of, so I ended up losing track of what's happening to her and at this point I doubt she will live for more than a few years **and I don't even know what's wrong with her.** She recently had to be hospitalised due to her health problems and I don't know why. I never visited her in the hospital and never even phoned her while she was there(and she was there for a week at least). When she came home after an operation(no idea what it was) I never hugged her or showed any other sign that I cared about her. When she confronted me about this I thought about apologising, but I couldn't bring myself to do it(I probably felt like it wouldn't be sincere).

I find this behaviour strange, but I don't feel bad about it. I do love my mom(or at least I think I do), yet I can't bring myself to care about her health. I fully acknowledge that she might die soon, but the thought of that doesn't really faze me. I would be devastated if my father was to die, though. I think I do love him more, despite both of my parents being really good people, even if both of them have some rough edges. My mother, in particular, is rather temperamental and can get angry rather quickly, which is worsened by her current health conditions. Right now she is extremely volatile and will start shouting almost immediately after something displeases her. I do not take it to heart when she yells at me because I know that such health problems can change everyone. Instead, I remember all the times she helped me out or listened to my problems and gave advice when I couldn't talk to my dad about them since he is too narrow-minded and conservative for me to truly connect with him.

I suppose I should wrap this up. In conclusion(kind of a TL;DR):

* My procrastination led me into failing to enroll into a university since I never actually studied for my biology exam and I'm afraid it will happen again if I keep this up.
* I want to start writing, but I can't even force myself to sit down and start doing it. The most I could do is this post which took at least two months of hesitation and one mental breakdown that motivated me to finally write this.
* I hate my job. I want to either quit it and try to dedicate the free time to writing and studying or get a new one which doesn't involve much work, but does provide plenty of free time(like a night shift guard or something like that) that I will be forced to use on something other than games. I'm not sure if the latter is possible though.
* I don't care about my mother's health despite the fact that she can die soon and I don't really feel bad about it.

What do I do about all this? I've never taken any medication and I've never talked to therapists. I have thought of suicide, and at first the only thing that stopped me was the reaction of those who cared about me, but now that thought vanished, since I don't believe in the afterlife and dead men don't care about feelings of others. The only thing deterring me now is writing. I genuinely feel like I could become a good writer, and this really helped me because I feel like I can accomplish something, which in turn prevents feelings of worthlessness that plagued my thoughts whenever I thought of suicide.

139,"First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to read this! 

I’m wondering if it’s worth visiting my college’s walk in clinic to see if i have add. i’ve taken a few online screenings that say i probably have it, but im really terrified of embarrassing myself by going through the whole diagnosing process only to find out i don’t have add. I have social anxiety and it keeps me from doing a lot of things that would benefit me, just because im afraid of embarrassment, rejection, etc. i would talk to my parents about this, but a family friend has adhd and they have a very negative view of adderall/doubt his symptoms. so again, i’m scared of rejection

I’m just going to give some background about myself and things i’ve noticed that could be symptoms

some background:

I grew up in an extremely supportive family environment. my parents have done so much to set me up for success, (eg: paying my college tuition, paying for an incredible high rise apartment, just generally always being there for me) yet i’m struggling a lot with college. I feel like if anyone else was lucky enough to be in my position, they would absolutely make the most of it and flourish. This makes me feel REALLY guilty.

possible symptoms:

-idly clenching jaw. i think its called bruxism, but i noticed about a year ago that i’m constantly clenching my jaw, even “at rest”. idk if this is an add/adhd thing or an anxiety thing

-forgetting things/entering a room and forgetting why im there. FREQUENTLY. i always set something down and forget where it is. i take forever to do laundry/clean my room even though i hate the condition its in i just cant force myself to do it 

-strong desire to focus, inability to do so. never studied in high school, history of completing assignments late due to forgetfulness and inability to focus, but still did relatively well and got A’s and B’s without studying. now that im in college, i dont study, i turn in all my assignments late or not at all and i dont get good grades

-impulse purchases. recently bought a fish tank  and fish and plants for over $100 dollars because i read through the aquariums subreddit and wanted a new hobby. now i have no interest in delving into this hobby and am simply maintaining the tank that i feel very guilty for purchasing. i am a college student with little money to spare, yet i still do these things. i buy food and then dont eat it/forget its there. if theres i sale i always buy it, even if i dont need it. i always buy candy and treats and have a general lack of control over my eating habits. im not fat, but i may be leaning towards overweight due to my lack of self control. 

-i desperately want to get in shape/go to the gym, but have a hard time forcing myself to. this is something that makes me wonder if im just being lazy. i’ll go to the gym for a few weeks at most consistently, then i get bored of it or lose motivation. idk why theres just something blocking me from getting where i want to be

-i make plans/write out things to do in my planner, but still forget to do things because i forget to look at my planner/just forget in general 

-i procrastinate until its crunch time and have to get everything done. this is the only time i can sometimes make myself focus. sometimes i just get overwhelmed by it all and break down

-i get really interested in something for a few days, research it a ton, then lose interest. for example, lately ive had a habit of extensively researching different careers, get the feeling that its what i want to do w my life, then lose all interest. then i find another career, get super invested, rinse repeat. i’ve also done this with lots of random hobbies. i can read extensively about random things i get interested in all of a sudden, but i can’t focus on work. 

-mood swings/experiencing emotions very intensely. i thought i was depressed for awhile, but i dont think i am. there are still plenty of things that bring me joy. but when i’m sad, i am absolutely devastated. i cry easily, but am also very excitable, . i really care about people and animals, which might just be a “duh, everyone does,” kinda thing. but i just have very strong emotions that flip back and forth relatively quick. i daydream a lot and always fantasize about magically fixing all my problems

-i’ve always blamed myself for being a lazy person, but i always feel EXTREMELY GUILTY. i feel so awful when i do poorly in school, i want desperately to get good grades, but i just dont do it. i dont know if that is still considered laziness. i feel so horrible that my parents are paying all this money for me to go to school and im failing them and myself. i have a wonderful apartment but i wont engage w the community and the community on campus. i feel like anyone else in my position would be flourishing, yet i am not. 

i just want to know if im lazy or if something is wrong with me?? i know i have social anxiety, so maybe that could be holding me back like this, but it doesnt really explain my forgetfulness/lack of focus",16Oct2019,22

141,"Just writing down part of my life story. The formative years of my childhood to be more specific. I've heard writing about it may help, and maybe some of you went through similar experiences and can find some comfort in the fact that you're not alone in this. Well, here goes..

I have always been that weird loner kid, completely living in my own imagination and fantasy world, preferring to play alone, playing boyish games (being a girl), daydreaming most of the day away, not really being able to accept reality, as I very early on found out was cold, harsh, and unforgiving.   


Throughout my childhood I barely had any friends, had trouble connecting with my classmates and was bullied from the start of (pre)school. I gained a lot of weight as I didn't feel understood and, not knowing what to do with these negative emotions, I turning to overeating. The bullying continued, with renewed fervour: not only was I the weird kid now, but also the fat one. The sports classes were a weekly nightmare, as I have always been bad at sports. I am flat-footed and have weak ankles, which causes sprained ankles whenever I attempted to run. You can see why I wasn't a popular team choice for any sports. This automatically always left me as last pick, adding to my insecurity and loneliness.   


Some girls befriended me and, insecure as I was, I let myself be baited into talking badly about other classmates, which then would be used against me in front of the entire class. Public shaming and humiliation was daily routine for me.   
I remember going to camp with my classmates, as is tradition in 8th grade, and my friend asked me to join everyone else as they were swimming in a lake. I mentioned to her that I was too afraid to get bullied, but she convinced me.   
As soon as I got changed into my bathing suit and went into the water, the bullying began, and she laughed loudest of all. This was how the girls bullied. Now the boys would prefer the physical kind of bullying: punching me, kicking me, spitting on me. Some of them would act nicely to me when they were alone with me, but at other moments laugh and kick at me with the rest of the kids. I remember my mom talked to the principal and the teachers about the bullying, even though I told her not to. It made things even worse.  


There's this particularly traumatic experience that I have never told my parents, or anyone really. Here's to hoping it will be good to finally talk about it.  
In third grade, I must've been around 6 years old, the teacher left the class alone for a long while. Everyone was working on their assignment, but focus dwindled quickly, and kids started playing around, talking and laughing.   
My bully, sitting straight across from me, leans towards me and says, loud enough for everyone to hear: ''I'm going to give you two choices: either you show everyone here your pussy, or I'll beat the living shit out of you so hard, not even your own mother will recognise the bloody pulp that remains.''  
It shocked me to my core. I felt dazed, frightened. The entire class was looking at me, the bully and his friends smirking  at me. I heard some girls laughing in the background, it seemed really far away. The bully got tired of waiting, made a fist and made a swing towards my face, but stopped just before impact. ''Last chance'' he said.  
I looked desperately at the classroom door, hoping, nay, praying, that the teacher would come back or that I could make a run for it. One of the bully's friends noticed this and told me ''Oh, you won't be able to make it, trust me.''  
Frightened and ashamed, I submitted to the bully's wishes and pulled my leggings and panties down. No one said a thing, I just heard some muted grins and chuckles. ''Spread it open for us to see.'' the bully said. So I did.   
What happened next, I do not remember. Maybe the situation got even worse and I successfully managed to forget?   
If only I could've forgotten about the whole thing..   


Honestly, this is just the tip of the iceberg of traumatic events throughout my life, but I think this is where it all started for me. Depression and anxiety creeping into my life at an early age, accompanied by severe insecurity and shame of even existing..

142,"I don't know what is going on, but I do know I am confused and something is up. If anyone has any sort of clue what is happening to me I would appreciate the information.

Over the past 4 years I have disconnected largely from friends and family, my family does not like me and I feel bad for the things that I do but never change. For 4 years I've had these waves of anger, hating everyone for their views, beliefs and hating myself for not being what people want me to be, and for not having the gut to end myself.

I got into a relationship and I cheered up for a while but there was always this feeling of dread within me, like my guts had melted into black tar. Moving is a chore, thinking is a chore, life is a chore. During this time I began to feel as if I wanted to hurt people, I took (non sexual) pleasure from making them feel like shit. Half of me knows it is fucked and can feel compassion, but over time I have spent more time thinking with a hateful mindset than a compassionate one, as if it is taking over what I really feel.

I turned to smoking, which is no big deal. But then I took acid a few times, had a few good trips and a handful of very nasty ones. I stopped sleeping as I have always been afraid of the dark, and people coming to get me. I can't trust friends, family, doctors, the government or anyone that has power or influence. I started to see humanity from an outside perspective, I sometimes black for a second then suddenly remember my entire life. I find a lot of things peculiar, that we use money, love and culture amongst other things. I don't understand what it means to be human anymore.

I don't know what is happening to me, but I feel like I have thought too much and I am now trapped in my own body; I need to get out and go back to being normal. If anyone has any suggestions or advice please let me know, I want to be innocent again.",16Oct2019,3

I don't wanna cry. In fact, I do. I wanna cry as bad as I did the last time I could, screaming, trying to let go of my own chest. It doesn't make any sense, does it? I don't either. But I just feel so empty. I need a tear to make my heart a little less dry. Just one fucking tear, it's all I've been asking for.

I'm not even sad. I'm just bored. Numb. I'm nothing, but the biggest. And even though I'm sick of being tired, I don't wanna be okay. *''What's wrong with me?''*, I used to think. I used to cry it out. I used to think I was poorly made. I used to say it a lot, too. *''What do I want?'',* I wonder. I don't wanna be okay but I don't wanna be like this anymore either.

So what now?

It's nothing again. I know. I know I don't wanna be okay because I don't know how to. I used to be better and, at the time, I didn't know how to manage it.

i’ve never had friends, ever. people assume i am antisocial. which is totally understandable. i am very hard to approach/get to know.

the thing is even if i suddenly wasn’t anxious anymore, i... still wouldn’t know how to talk normally. i don’t really have a personality. i don’t know how to be charismatic, i don’t know how to make people laugh, i’m even shit at listening to others talk and genuinely being interested in them.

there are so many skills that i have to develop that i think most people have gotten on lock by the time they hit double digits.

there was a girl who seemed to be interested in me a couple years back. i liked her so so much. but i couldn’t give anything back. now she has a girlfriend. i see them together all the time and it kills me. that could have been me. if i was an actual person with a personality instead of a anxious mess.

i don’t know what to do. i feel like i’m wasting these years that everyone says they had the time of their life in. i wish i had friends to hang out with. i wish i had a girl to kiss. i wish i had a lot. i wish my brain wasn’t sick.

147,"
4 years ago my dad was fired because of his illness, but I thought he had bipolar or something and didn't think it was that serious

When I started grade 10 (last year) he stopped paying my school fees and actually stopped being the breadwinner. My mom was basically the man of the house and she was pissed, but she was already used to it because she had to provide for the family before she had me.

He's such a manipulative person, he lies to my mom me and my elder sister. He has  huge debts and any money he gets, he either gamble's it away or use it for medication... I honestly think his doctor is fu*ked up, because me and my mom found a long list of prescribed medication and he isn't even sick! Whenever you have to go somewhere and he has to take you, he'll suddenly get sick (which I know is in his mind). 

For the money part I can understand, both my parents were poor but made sure me and my sister had a comfortable lifestyle, but the medication part? Just now I was watching a movie and my dad came out of his room and he looked so weird and kept on tripping (I knew he was drugged, but this was the first time I have seen him like that) my mom was laughing at him, but later knew whatever type of medication he drank, that sh*t is strong.

I'm planning on calling his doctor, because the last time he gave dad insulin when he didn't need it because I think he has type of diabetes with the medication and not the injection (I dunno, I don't pay attention in Biology) but he's doctor is probably medicating him wrong and my dad doesn't have the simple knowledge of these types of things and he's basically killing himself with these pills.

He is obsessed with medication, the psychiatrist, different doctors, getting sick and loves hospitals... Could it be he never got attention as a child and gets the attention from them? I mean even if he has a running nose he thinks he has a bad flu, he won't hesitate to take my own medication because he took my antidepressants. I honestly don't think he has a drug problem, he hates druggies and drinkers... Or does he have a drug prob? 

Honestly I don't love my dad that much because he never acted like a father, but I still care for his well being... No one needs to go through that.",16Oct2019,1

150," 

My parents have done a lot of shit. I'm so scared of them sometimes. But other times I'll joke with them and all will be fine until the next thing pops up.

I've thought about ditching them after I graduate later this year and just never talking to them again, but that makes me feel really guilty for some reason. I don't want to talk to them, but I don't want to have to deal with that guilt and thought I over reacted for the rest of my life.

From the time I was like 5 and on my parents were pretty absent in my life. I was often left at my grandma's for weeks at a time while they went off and fucked around because being a parent was too much. I was depressed, stayed in my room all day and never really interacted with them. I used to cry because I genuinely thought they loved our dog more than me. I hated them. They bought me stuff, but they weren't family. They didn't really want to do anything for me. They denied my depression for 10 years. I started self harming at the age of 8. I didn't really know what I was doing, but it made me feel better.

At 11 they sold my dog, the one thing that made me happy, because he was too energetic for them.

When I was 12 my parents divorced. I cried. My father yelled at me for being upset, told me I was being pathetic. My mother came out to me and said she was questioning her sexuality. And then everything went quiet. My mom moved into a hotel and I didn't see or hear from her in over a year. My dad became an alcoholic and left me at my grandparents house where every night someone would be fighting and throwing glass. I had a lot of panic attacks during this time, and was obviously not accepted as a member of the family there. Meanwhile dad went out every night to drink and do drugs. He got beat up pretty badly one night. He stumbled up the stairs and walked into the room I stayed in thinking it was the bathroom. He fell to the ground and woke both I and my cousin up. My dad was bloody and mangled and drunk. It was scary. He was scary. I wont ever forget his face that night.

When I turned 16 they started getting more involved in my life. But in an awful way. They were over protective and possessive. My father once yelled at me in front of my friend for putting on lip gloss, saying, ""You better not be fucking around with any boys."", deadly serious. He also during this time made it very clear that if I was gay he would absolutely hate me. He used to talk outside my door loudly, saying that if any of his kids came out as gay, he would kick them out so fast and make sure they knew they weren't welcomed back. This lead to me internalizing my sexuality for such a long time. And being terrified of my dad.

Earlier this year I tried to kill myself. I told a doctor this, and I was sent to a ward. The first thing my parents said to me wasn't; are you okay?, I love you, or even why? The first thing they said to me was ""you aren't doing this to get out of school, right?"" It fucking stung. And honestly, my time in the ward was so nice. Being away from them was amazing.

I try to talk about messed up shit they did during my childhood, but they always deny it and try to say I'm making it up or I'm making them feel bad about something that doesn't matter anymore.

I don't know, I just get really frustrated cause I don't know if I have the right to want to disown them. They're fucked, and they make fun of me a lot and are really unsupportive and judgmental, but we laugh sometimes and they buy me things and it just makes me feel guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, I'm a 16 year old student in America suffering from Major Depression and Anxiety, most of it due to a lot of bad stuff that happened in my past which is a completely different story I don't want to get into, but as a result of multiple events in my life I've begun to have certain thoughts in my head. I don't really know how to explain how I'm feeling because I'm literally fighting myself in my head trying to write this, almost like I'm 2 separate people living in one body, one that's me, and another which has been forcing me to torture myself for almost 6 years. So excuse me if this doesn't make any sense to you, it doesn't really make sense to me either, but this is what I've been feeling and saying to myself for years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every since the beginning of High school, my mental state has been deteriorating at an alarming rate, to the point where I don't even feel anything, I just feel like an empty husk, not even human anymore. I've been ridiculing myself in every way I can, making up lies about myself, purposefully pushing others away, all in an attempt to keep being miserable. For some reason, I love to be miserable, I love hating myself, I love telling myself that I don't matter and It would be so much better if I kill myself, and I hate it. I don't want to be miserable, but at the same time I find it so addicting. And on top of all of the thoughts and Lies I've made up about myself, I also try and ""punish myself"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I've lead myself to believe over the years to believe that I, and solely I, am responsible for all the evil in the world, that because of me, millions of people die from all the evil acts of man, and I believe that I deserve to be punished for my awful actions. It's extreme, I know, but my awful reasoning is nothing compared to what I do to myself. Some examples of these punishments are things like starving myself, usually skipping school lunch and trying to occupy my mom so she won't make dinner for me, not socializing with others and trying to appear unwelcoming and irritable, not talking for days upon end, and trying to kill myself (I've gotten over this one, thankfully). I began to disregard everything in my life, my family, my friends, my academics, the only thing I began to focus on was making myself suffer, and I loved it. For whatever reason, I wanted to be miserable, I wanted to hate myself, I wanted to die, and I felt like I deserved it. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the things I've listed above are things that I've managed to get over with many, many therapists, and I've been making a slow recovery. I've been focusing on getting my life back together, working on fixing my academic problems, becoming more socially active, but the thoughts and urges are still there. I think I know that those thoughts will never truly leave my head, but I've been trying to get over them and so far I think I'm doing a good job at ignoring the urges to harm myself. I really hope this helps anyone out there who is going through something similar to this. There's a lot more to this story that just that, and I left out a lot because It's really personal and I don't feel comfortable sharing it all yet, but  if anyone has any questions regarding my situation then feel free to ask.

i have wanted almost desperately to be mentally ill/have a mental illness for about four years now. ever since i became a part of the lgbt community (where there are many mentally unstable people honestly) in middle school, i've been preoccupied with mental illnesses. its really snowballed though to the point where i find myself fantasizing about being schizophrenic or psychotic. 

i believe it stems from not having any successful friendships and no romantic partners my whole life. i feel like im absolutely starved of genuine and pure love or affection or care even. i guess seeing the really mentally ill have so much attention made me sub conscientiously associate mental illness with love and support. (realizing this threw me jnto a state of thinking i was schizotypal.) 

i know for a fact (as far as i can without going to a doctor) i at least have bpd. maybe avpd, possible a bit of the previously mentioned schizotypal (i have been researching and learning about these symptoms and seeing if i connect with them at all for a pretty long time now, but please dont mistake this as self diagnosing, which i am generally against) but i cant fend off the constant feelings of guilt, shame and embaressment from wanting these serious illnesses.

I can help others with their problems and share my own. I'm inside and outside my own head and it's all balanced.

I isolate myself from everybody and barely open my mouth. I dont feel like moving or talking or thinking because that's too overwhelming.

158," I'm looking for some solid advice because I just don't know how to handle this anymore. I'm writing for both myself and my girlfriend of four months. 

I started dating this girl around June, we had previously dated before. Something to know is that we both have huge mental health issues. She has tried taking her life multiple times over the course of ten years and I have once in May when my life fell apart. 

I have a full time job at a deli and full time college student and any time I have I am usually with her. I knew about her mental health issues when starting the relationship like her extreme anger, heavy bipolar depression, general anxiety disorder, and ptsd. But I did not really care because I love her very much. 

But recently it has been getting worse. She hasn't raised her voice or hurt me in any way, but she goes on long rants about she is not good enough for me, or the constant one is that I am just going to end up leaving her or stop caring about her like every other person she has dated. She has even said before ""it is ok if you don't care about me as long as you are still here.""

I reply that isn't true, ""I will always love and care about you. Even if I am not as available as I used to be."" 

Then she erupts with a text saying, "" you are just spoiled you have the perfect life. You have tons of friends a college you are going to, a car. You have no right to complain because my life is literal hell.""

I don't have the perfect life first of all, yeah, admittedly I have it better than her. But I have two therapists for my anxiety and BPD, I owe 6,000 dollars to my dad, got kicked out of my moms house. Plus I have a tendency to self harm due to some voices in my head.  And last week two of my friends commited suicide.

And her mental state just gets worse and worse. As well as mine. I used to be able to calm her down but I can't do that anymore it has gotten so bad. She is so used to being forever alone that she doesn't actually believe that anyone will care about her. 

I can't break up with her, that will be bad for both me and her. She is one of my favorite things about life. But I can't continue to date her if she continues this trend. There is more to this story that I was needing to post but my memory has gotten really screwed up the past months because of some sleep issues.

162,"Every time I inconvenience or upset someone in my personal life, my immediate thought is that I need to die. Not kill myself necessarily, but whoever I inconvenienced would immediately benefit if I were dead. I don't tell the person this, but I can't forget it until the issue has been resolved. 

I've had these thoughts for my entire life, mostly surrounding arguments with my parents. For example, when I would get bad grades for not studying in middle school, my mom would be angry and my internal reaction would always be something like ""my mom would be much better off if I was dead because I wouldn't be able to upset her with my bad test grades."" I remember doing the same for even lesser infractions as early as 4th and 5th grade. I was always a straight A student, so bad grades were usually like getting a C on one exam. 

I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder already through a brief stint in therapy on my college campus. I can recognize that these thoughts objectively are not true and they do not benefit me, but I can't help repeating it to myself over and over again anyway and feeling that they are absolutely true in the moment. I've tried the basic panic attack management techniques that my therapist recommended, like active breathing, but even when I calm down for a few minutes I end up thinking about the problem and how it means I need to die soon again anyway. Has anyone else experienced thoughts like these, and if so how did you manage them?",16Oct2019,9
163,"Whatever I look at, touch, smell, eat, it's gonna make me feel terrible. Sometimes it's mild enough that I can handle it. Some other times, it pushes me to wanting to kill myself. And the latter has been happening on a daily basis. I don't know what to do? I am seeking professional help but I am not getting it. I can't insist more than I have, unless I show up to the hospital with a gun on my temple. There is nothing I can do right now, and I am alone and my mental health is really, really bad. I don't know what to do.",16Oct2019,10
164,"Long post, but I’m desperate and need advice immediately. I’ve been on vacation overseas with my mom and friend for the past day. My mom felt like she needed to get away from stress at home so she organized the 10 day trip. All was going well until my mom’s sciatica started worsening at the airport. Her sciatica is basically caused by a pinched nerve in her back which makes it excruciatingtly painful to walk. She’s had to walk slower and rest more. Earlier tonight, she experienced a severe panic attack in her hotel room. She felt like she needed to get away, but couldn’t because of her siatica. I’m exhausted from jet lag but I’ve had to sit in her room with her for 3 hours now. She’s looking at the next flight to go back home tomorrow, but she isn’t even sure she can do it with her siatica and anxiety.

It seems her anxiety started after she rode an intense roller coaster at Universal studios a couple years ago. And recently her brother, sister and both parents have died. I think those two things have made my mother seriously mentally ill. I’ve been trying to get her to go to therapy for the past year, but if I even bring up therapy she starts having a panic attack. But this is no way for her to live. Not to mention, it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health constantly worrying if my mom is ok. Should I tell my mother I will not talk to her again unless she gets help? I’m so desperate to get her into treatment I’m willing to do anything.",16Oct2019,0
165,"I have been having a rough couple weeks with a lot of intrusive and existential thoughts and thought I would vent to get it off my chest, for example:

* How am I going to cope when my mom / my husband (not even married yet) / my sister passes away
* How am I going to cope with aging
* What if I am alone when I am older, what if my kids abandon me (don't have any kids yet)
* What if I get sick and am not able to live a full life.

I had a panic attack three weeks ago that was a consequence of therapy and delving deep into trauma. We decided to take a step back after that because we realized I am alone in this city and don't have a strong support system.

The anxiety right now is leaving me feeling a bit hopeless. Reddit and social media can be a double edged sword where I see thing that trigger these thoughts and make me thing what if that happens to me. For example I saw a post of suicidal ideation and that just triggered so many what if thoughts about what if I get so depressed and I get to that point.

I know really these thoughts are manifesting from:

* Homesickness, feeling lonely in the city I am currently in. Many times all I want is someone to just lay down with me and be there while we are doing our own things. My best friend from back home has been a saviour in she facetimes me everynight until I fall asleep. I try to get my roommate to sleep with me cause we are close but she is really busy and goes to sleep much later than me and wakes up much earlier. My other friend here is just really busy and he comes over sometimes, I bus with him so that is nice but I wish he would come over more.
* Getting to the end of my degree, thinking about what I am going to do next. I know I am going to take a break after I finish my degree but after that I don't know what I want to do with my life - maybe policy analysis cause that is what I want to do now. I know I want to have a full life, have things to do on Halloween and thanksgiving, meet with friends and travel. That is what is keeping me going.
* Trauma from when I was younger making me fear that I will never get into a good relationship. I have body and trust issues which I now I need to overcome but will probably work on when I am back home and have a better support system.

Any advice for a lonely grad student with anxiety?",16Oct2019,1
166,"I've never really talked about how I felt in depth, and whenever I try to to another person they just end up saying ""I know."" or ""It happens to me too.""  But I'm starting to wonder if how I'm feeling is really normal.  Last year was the toughest year in my whole life.  I was basically by myself constantly, and my closest friend even attempted to commit suicide (she received help and she is currently okay).  While I was going through all of this my anxieties sky rocketed and I had so many anxiety attacks to where I was okay with being alone all the time.  Then I slowly started to feel less.

I went from feeling like I wanted to die to feeling as if I was already dead.  I felt like an empty shell just watching my life play through a screen.  It's been happening for over half a year now and I could care less about getting help.  All of my social anxieties disappeared and I just kept on watching my life play by.

Whenever I try to joke with someone I feel like I'm lying.  Or when I accidentally upset someone I don't feel bad but I pretend I do because I'm suppose to.  I'm scared to be alive because everything just feels not real and like I'm living in a dream.  I don't feel in control of myself.  I'm so much smarter and physically capable of things than I use to be and it just feels like I'm not me.

167,"I'm 16 years old and have been in and out of therapy for about five years at this point. It started as just general anxiety about leaving primary school but has spiraled out of my control ever since. Nowhere is working for me, none of the seven therapy centres I've attended have had a positive impact. I'm so fucking lost and I don't know what I'm going to do. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and anorexia but there has to be something else there, there's no way that is the extent of my mental health conditions, but every-time I mention this, my therapists just disregard it.

Some of my most common behaviors include isolating myself, refusing (only in sporadic bouts) to speak to anyone, a sense of bitterness towards everyone (including my family), very self destructive tendencies, disgust at the thought of romantic and sometimes platonic relationships and extremely rapid mood swings or rapidly changing opinions.

It's all gotten so much worse recently, particularly more isolation and refusal to eat. I'm becoming able to starve for longer periods of time and as much as I shouldn't, I praise myself for it.

It''s all too much, it's been going on for too long and I'm terrified that one day I might snap. Therapy doesn't work, I'm too scared to take medication, I have nowhere else to go, I just need help.",16Oct2019,3
168,"The header says it all really. I’m in the food industry. My boss is kind of airheaded and not in control of the kitchen at ALL. The managers don’t manage my coworkers. At the end of each shift, each person who runs my “pantry station” is suppose to do the following:
- write a prep list for the things we are running low on.
-sweep
-restack any plates so the next person doesn’t have to run back and forth to grab plates during a potential rush. 
-top off containers and get counts on desserts

And during each shift, if there is free time, you complete what was on the last persons prep list. Or as much of it as possible. 

I only work morning shifts, which means I complete prep lists made by the night shift worker who was at my station. Nothing is ever topped off, no one updates the pastry list, no one follows through with completing prep lists if there is down time. No one by me and one other girl. I feel isolated when I’m not working the same shift as this other girl as she is my only work friend. 

So I’ve been under huge amounts of pressure to complete an absurd amount of things, even during food rushes. It’s making my anxiety spiral and I feel so alone and stressed out that it’s triggering my depression as well. As a defense mechanism, and sort of in retaliation towards my managers for not stepping up, I over apologize and guilt my boss and managers into feeling bad for me. I do it on purpose because even when they give me decent or even good criticism, I’m mad that I feel so alone because of them. So I get self deprecating and over apologize to make everyone pity me. I know it’s toxic, and I hate using my mental illnesses as a cop out. But I never do this unless i feel like life isn’t worth living anymore and feel like I need the sympathy. I know it’s not healthy.",16Oct2019,4
169,"All my life I've been assumed to be ""naturaly"" smart. I've always had top grades in every subject without much effort. Well, I've recently gone up to the next school tier. Everything has gotten so much harder. I've gone from A's to C's. Everyone around me already got the idea that I'll graduate with flying colours. I've shown interest for the top veterinarian school in my country, which requires 56 out of 60 possible points from my current school. (I can get 4-6 bonus points).

Nothing I do seems to be good enough. No schoolwork, no matter how much I try to focus is good enough. This has hit me hard. It feels like I'm disappoing everyone around me.

When I'm with my friends, it feels like I don't fit in. Don't take me wrong, I love them. But im always thinking that they don't like me. Like I'm the odd one out and I'm not contributing enough.

At home I'm always the ""easy one"". I'm never able to say no, or be angry and sad around my family. It's so hard having to keep to myself about everything. Resently I've sat up at nights crying myself to sleep, thinking about the future.

For about 6 months I’ve been lacking a sense of urgency towards anything. Im usually very calm, level headed and rarely get angry. I also find it easy to cope with anything, so it might be that. But I vividly remember having a sense of urgency before, my mind used to get on overdrive If I had, for example, an important project that I had a very short time to do. But just last week I had a very important assignment, and when there was less than an hour to finish it, I felt the same as 3 weeks ago when I had all the time in the world to do. I ended up handing it and just sent my profesor (cool guy) a corrupt pdf file with the title of the assignment on time, and when he eventually told me he couldn’t open it (the next day), I sent him the actual finished product which I finished way later.

She has done many other things too through her life like stealing and just general having an awful attitude,and gets into sort of tantrums and will just storm off with the biggest bitch face ever on. She is also a serial liar, when I told my parents about everything that had went on with her work they said that she told them that she got fired because she was sick and obviously not the other parts.

With each day that goes by, I feel more and more detached from reality, like I can’t even tell if I’m dreaming or not or I feel like I’m in some big simulation. In the same vein, I keep worrying that I’m having hallucinations and no one’s telling me. I don’t know why I’m having thoughts like that. I’ve also had quite a few instances recently where I’ve looked in the mirror and began actually panicking and shaking because I couldn’t tell who was looking back at me. Like, I just feel so incredibly detached from my body and my voice, I just never want to leave my house so nobody will be forced to see or hear me. My thoughts are getting more and more scattered and unclear. My brain then has too many thoughts and when I try to say them, my words come out jumbled and weird and I just sound super strange to whoever I’m talking to. It makes me want to never be in society again and to just become a hermit because I’m so scared of how people will view me. It’s becoming a serious problem. What should I do? I’ve only ever been diagnosed with MDD, and I haven’t felt very depressed recently at all, so I don’t know what this could mean.

175,"Hello. I am Plipplop, my online surname. I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder for 3 years ever since I was properly diagnosed. Although they won't really admit it, I was born when they were a bit older. Keeping this in mind, my father does not get and sometimes just plain refuses to accept I have what I have. From calling me a drama queen to promising things will get better, things have fallen into a cycle. What I came here for, however, was advice on how to finally fix this. My mother managed to finally believe me after years and get me diagnosed with the help of my also mentally ill sister, whom for a while they were all I had. Nothing is getting through to my father. Not me, not my sister, not my mother, not even my school therapist. Honestly, I am out of hope for him specifically. He is a great person, but he is hurting me mentally by not being there the same way that my mother and sister are. I don't expect much of him anymore, as he will never understand. To answer any questions, he is old-ish, but looks very good for his age. I am just out of hope after he did not believe a trained medical professional. My last shot is to get my out of school therapist involved, but if that does not work, I might need to detach from him mentally a bit more than we already are. He still cares about me, but gets dismissive and hostile whenever we argue about my mental illness. Also, no form of abuse goes on. I have been in a mentally abusive friendship before, so I know it is certainly not abuse. So, what do I do? I need help to try to save this, as my parents mean everything to me and I can't bear the thought of cutting one of them out.",16Oct2019,1
