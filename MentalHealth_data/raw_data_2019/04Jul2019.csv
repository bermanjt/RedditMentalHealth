0,"I’ve been having hallucinations for a while now that usually go like this:
I’m walking somewhere, and I see someone who has a characteristic of someone I’m afraid to see, like of a stalker of mine.
I then see the face as that person, and it’s still there when I double take and stays that way for a while until it stops. This usually manifests into 5-6 different people who I am afraid to and happens on a regular basis. I know it make seem very simple and stupid but when I see someone who has harassed me for years every time I go out and begin to panic, it takes a toll. This has been occurring for years. 
Any advice or anyone know what that is?",04Jul2019,1
1,I really dont think there is any hope there might be but i don't tell anyone i know my problems because i dont know why Actually but ive been thinking about suicide recently and idk why but most likely i wont do it because im a pussy and this is just a phase but i think i have depression i have to go to the doctors to make sure but ive always felt hopeless and a emotional mess for like forever,04Jul2019,1
2,"Yeah. This is a new level of depression for me. I’m depressed and feeling suicidal, but acknowledging that I have some power and control. I have a prescription for Ativan. Just picked up my 30 for the month and didn’t feel right. I asked my husband to give me one and hide the rest from me. I’m able to admit to myself and to my husband that I’m struggling right now for whatever reason. This is progress. I’m not bottling it up and getting impulsive. I’m acknowledging my mental illness, but I’m not letting it control me. This is progress. Everyone always says “it gets better.” Well damn, it actually does. Yes, I’m feeling like shit and beating myself up, but feeling like I have power and control actually makes me feel better. It gets better.",04Jul2019,0
3,"Does anyone here have an underlying feeling of constant anxiety? I recently graduated from university and I can't stop thinking that I need to be applying for jobs/going back to school. I have a list of things to do (take the GRE, get transcripts, finishing resume etc.) but I constantly feel like no matter what I do, it's never enough.  
Even though my family and friends are telling me that I can relax at home for a few weeks, I feel guilty every minute that I'm not being productive or indulging myself.   
When I'm interacting with others, I'm always worried that people will discover my anxiety or that I will give a bad impression. Is this normal? If not, does anyone have any advice for managing such intense anxiety?",04Jul2019,1

Hey all. I wanna know from people who had catatonic symptoms in some point of life how others people reacted to your lack of verbal response, physical movement and look at them. People can be so disgustig when doesn't understand it. One day my mom went to say something for me and I was seated in a chair immobile and I didn't answer her, so she asked again, called my name and I still mute, then she got angry, insulted me and didn't talk with me for some days because she think I was ignoring her purposely. It happened a lot of times. With my dumb friends was almost the same, I became catatonic around them and they called my name a lot of times, I didn't answer. So they start to make disgusting things to see if I would react, like pushing me to the ground, touching my ass and stupid things like that. After a time with no answer they stopped and start to ignore me for some minutes. After I still in the same position they just turn to me and said ""come on, man, stop with this stupid joke"". They shaked me by my shoulders but I couldn't react. And I never knows how to explain what was happening in my mind over the episodes. What can I do?

PS.: I don't have a diagnosis but I've been experimenting psychotic symptoms for some years that is transitional but no one seems to realize (my family or friends), or they just think I'm pretending. I finally came out of psychiatry system voluntarily because they was very negligent to me and I don't want no one trying to control my feelings and thoughts anymore. Everybody in my family and my ""friends circle"" are treating me like I'm a motherfucker because they think I'm not being true. Sometimes people response with violence. What can I do? Thank you.",04Jul2019,2
6,"So to start off, I'm in a bad place right now. I feel constantly hopeless and like I'm driving myself into a rut and it's been like this for the past four years or so probably longer. I have absolutely no idea if there is something medically wrong with me or if I'm just overreacting to changes going on in my life. But I seriously have been wishing I was never born and it only feels like it's getting worse. (Don't worry, I would never in a million years commit suicide.)

I want to make an appointment with my doctor to start some sort of testing for this thing, but I have no idea how and I really don't want to worry my parents. The lat thing they need to hear is that their son has been having some more maladaptive thoughts, but I do still want to have some sort of check up done. I'm currently 22 and living at home under their insurance. Is there any way to do that without having to lie about some kind of injury to get a doctor's appointment?

Btw I live in America, that is probably pertenant information.",04Jul2019,3

Should I find a therapist that would be more informed in these things or should I go to a therapist that specializes in depression and go from there and maybe get referred to another therapist if need be?

10,"So; me (also female 17) and my gf we’re going out for 2 months; that said we both liked each other for 9 months prior. This was her first relationship. 


I have severe depression and anxiety along with potential DID or schizophrenia although it was only discussed with my therapist and never officially diagnosed. Anyways this week my depression was hELL. I wrote a suicide note and everything was horrible. Eventually I managed to get through it with help from my parents. 


In the note I referenced her; basically telling her not to kill herself. Once I felt I was better (although I definitely wasn’t in my right mind) I showed her it, purely bcs I wanted her to know my depression wasn’t her fault and that I would want her to be okay —-&gt; I should not have done this at ALL I know so please don’t comment telling me how manipulative it seems it was the biggest lapse in judgement I’ve had. 


She now is having a stressful time (will not reveal it for privacy reasons) and I hate seeing her like this. 

So she’s going through some depressive episodes and anxiety 

That said; she’s shutting me out a little; snapping at me when trying to help, in knowing her for a while she’s never behaved like this before. 
The only real change, is me. 
A lot of the negative things happening to her have been a direct impact of our relationship (homophobia) 

And she’s moving away for a short while (1 month maybe longer) as am I for the same amount of time. 

I’m also split on two universities; one near her and one a couple hundred miles away. Both equally good for their fields. 

For me my anxiety is through the roof because of not being able to help her. 

I’ve had insomnia for a while sleeping at 8am and waking up at 12pm on average. 

I know that there’s no more I can do that tell her I’m there for her and give her space. 

But then again, should we break up it would help her home situation a little bit. It would also appease a lot of her stress and mine. 

Since we wouldn’t see each other for a while anyways there’s plenty of time to cope with the situation, and if we were to break up I would change universities to be further away so we would be far away from each other; meaning sh can get on with her life, and should we remain friends it wouldn’t impact on her getting a new relationship. 

Obviously I do believe that I love her and I want what’s best for her and as much as I hate to admit it; I am coming to the conclusion that I’m not the best for her, due to my anxiety disorder and depression and the fact I’m not a man. 

Then again I could be wrong and end up ruining things for her, if she’s already struggling it might tip her over the edge. 

I suggested breaking up once I learnt about us not seeing each other and she did not take it well at all; so obviously I went back on my words and we stayed together, 
I really want what’s best for her and I would truly hate for her mentality to be compromised because of me. 
Maybe I could suggest a break while she gets her head together? 
Any advice would be appreciated!",04Jul2019,1

If someone apologizes to me though I feel kinda shitty. If someone repetitively apologizes to me I get angry and yell at them or something. I had a friend say sorry for my great grandma passing away and I said “don’t apologize”. It made me sound like a dick, which I then apologized for.

18,"To preface this, I am morbidly obese, weighing in at about 360 at my heaviest, a few weeks ago. Ok. So. A few weeks ago (June 9th, to be exact), I moved back to school. I'm a sophomore in college. I wanted to get some classes in while I could. But I realized that I have not at all been living a healthy life. I wanted change. So, when I got here, I went to the student health website and began scheduling appointment after appointment. I got all the tests i could at the general doctor, STI's, Thyroid, Diabetes, anything else the doctor could think of. I also had an appointment with the school's top psychiatrist. Now that I was back at school, there is a student insurance plan included in my tuition which allowed me to get all the help i desperately needed for so long. I have known for years (from professional diagnosis) that i have anxiety and depression disorders, along with insomnia. I was finally able to start medications for these things. Now, I soon after went to an appointment with a nutritionist, and a ""fitness consultant"". The basic idea behind the consultant would be that she would help me form a plan for working out based off what I like to do, and how often I could go to the gym, etc. The original plan was to go 3-4 times a week, alternating between cardio and strength training. I'm proud to say I've completely blown past this with my new found, medicine induced motivation. I'm now going to the gym 5-6 days a week, strength training every time. For cardio, i walk everywhere, I haven't been on the bus system in almost two weeks. In the past two weeks, since our last meeting, I've lost 10 pounds. I'm drinking between 3-4 litres of water a day, and have completely cut out soda (I do probably still drink too much coffee tho). Overall, I'm feeling great. I'm losing weight, I'm showering daily, no longer sleeping through my alarms, and I've gained back confidence that, I honestly don't know if I ever before possessed.

20,"When I was in 3rd or 4th grade my parents split, and I get to visit my dad on random days, mainly Sundays for a few hours.

Today my dad, my sister, and I went for hibachi. Me and my dad had to pick up my sister from the nail salon and he brought up my self harm.

Immediately I grew uncomfortable, I normally don’t like talking about it without my therapist because I’ll get emotional real quick, and I didn’t want to do that before dinner and ruin the night.

The main thing that set me off was the way he spoke about my self harm and depression and stuff. He spoke like I had chose to get depressed and said stuff like “I don’t wanna hear about this anymore” and I didn’t know how to react. 

Once we got to hibachi we sat the chefs throwing the knifes and stuff and I jokingly said “Would you let me do that?”. 

It was clearly a joke. He follows up with “You can’t be around sharps”. Almost like a joke.

Immediately the mood changes and I shut down.

I don’t want to see like a snowflake or something, but issues with my Dad sparked most of my depression and anxiety issues so him saying that was BAD.

I say something along the lines a “Really? Now?”

He goes “I shouldn’t even have to say that, there is no reason why you should be doing that.” 

I really wanted to cry, I wanted to go home, my Dad never got the full story on the self harm and depression. I just wanted to shut my eyes and never wake up.

A few minutes later he realized what he did and he apologized profusely, I told him it was ok to avoid arguing, but it hurt a lot.

I don’t know why I wrote this, but I’m just laying in bed thinking now and I can’t sleep and I don’t know if my Dad was being mean and ignorant or if I’m just too sensitive.

I would not be able to continue the course from the hospital, and I know that I can take it in the fall with no problems, but I'm worried everyone around me and myself would be disappointed if I dropped.

I don't want to live anymore, and not just because of the course, and I know I can't deal with both at once because the course is taking up so much of my time. How will I even deal with my future if I can't be productive though? How will I get a job and make money if a simple course is too much for me?

28,"I’m 17,  gonna be 18 in less than 2 weeks. For as long as I can remember, I’ve never had trouble talking to girls or making friends. (being social) 

However of the dozen or so girls I’ve asked out over time they’ve either all been taken, gay, or just not interested, (also girls don’t lie, just say no, our egos aren’t that fragile) 
At first, I thought I was just asking the wrong girls, so I actually went and found girls that were not my type, and still got rejected. I understand rejection is kinda inevitable, that basically everyone gets rejected a few times. At the same time though 12/12 kinda seems like I might be the problem. 

I’m not ugly, i’m slightly above average. Chubby yes, but i’m not obese. I’m like perfect size for cuddling.  I’ve got a good sense of humor, i’m not shy i’m pretty confident and I don’t get super nervous or anxious when taking to girls because they’re just another person to me. 

I can admit unabashedly i’m a virgin. So maybe i’m just fucking myself up, and don’t even know it yet. 

There was girl who actually didn’t initially reject me. In fact at first she said yes and snapped me for a while. before for leading me on just to fuck my best friend. I Wouldn’t have cared if it was anyone else, but that hurt. To know that not only did I get second place again, but also knowing that it was your friend since elementary, the one you told you liked that girl. 

Then after that I started noticing how no one ever messages me, With everyone I know, i’m the initiator I always am the first one to snap or call anyone (i’m not impatient, they just never message me), no one listens to me when I talk, no one cares about my feelings. They all want my help when they need it, but when I ask for anything it’s either given begrudgingly, or it’s simply not there at all. 

I have 2 real friends I can rely on but taking with them about something like this seems like too much for them to take all at once. Also, can I rely on them. My friend for over a decade spit on our friendship for some pussy. What’s to say they won’t do something similar.

I always ask myself this question. Whenever I try to make friends it always feels like I’m forcing myself to make them from outside pressures, like if my parents think that I am a weirdo, or not to look like a loser at school or to gain something etc.. I just hate the whole topic.

I never really feel “lonely”, which I could assume would be feeling sad without anyone, but more stressed and pressured over the fact my parents, and society want me to have friends and I don’t really care. This sometimes makes my anxious in social situations. 

I hate the question, “who are your friends?”

Making friends is hard work, and I’m pretty happy with my life. Why should I be forced to to this?

But these pressures really do make me hate my life and contemplate why I don’t have friends, as well as make me shame myself for having none.

From time to time I always wonder if I would really enjoy social gatherings.

I don’t know if this is a question or really the right section for this post, but should I be reaching our to make friends? Do I really need them? Would I enjoy social gatherings?

I vaguely remember, but I’m not sure if it’s real or just a dream, being extremely violent towards my sister who is two years younger than me. I’m 21 now, and could have been anywhere between 6 and 11 I truly have no idea.

I “remember” pinning her down and holding her there while she cried, and saying extremely cruel/borderline psychopathic things to her like, “I’m going to hurt you” and then laughing crazily, while she, through tears, called me crazy. 

I’ve never been violent towards anyone as far as I can remember, yet I seem to have this awful memory? I already think I’m a piece of shit for other reasons, but who the fuck cares? My sister probably has this horrible view of me secretly, she doesn’t show it as far as I can tell were actually pretty close in real life. Yet if she does hate me and has managed to keep it a secret, I’ve never shown any remorse for it if I did it. 

This is just...traumatic for so many reasons. One that I’m capable of such sociopathic cruelty, two that my sister was likely traumatized by this and may be mentally affected to this day, she may even have learned to avoid conflict with me because she knows what would happen (it does seem like I always initiated verbatim fights as a kid), and three that I’m capable of repressing such a huge thing

I don’t even want to bring this up with my therapist cause I’m messed up enough as it is, I don’t think I could stand anyone knowing what I did if it’s true, and sadly my gut says it may be.

The only hope is that is somehow an awful dream that I had that’s “imprinted” itself as a memory.

Worst of all, the existential crises, derealization that life is just a simulation.

Why else would a human obsess over these thoughts (although it’s a bad idea to compare myself to the human race, as I am different than those around me and most humans are empathically challenged monsters), unless these thoughts allow me to snap back to my true reality. 

Regardless of my anxiety-fueling philosophical concepts of a nihilist existence, my mental state has always been broken. Some moments I am happy, but they appear as a dream to my ordinary state. The state I enter into as I close my eyes late at night and failingly attempt to develop a blank mind. What if my insomnia (caused by the lack of REM) is caused by my early and refuted diagnosis of nystagmus? Here I go again, obsessing over my health, both mental and physical. My social skills may have gotten better, but not substantially. I only talk to the people I know very well, and the strangers I speak to are only present at my jobs in which I am forced to speak in an altered personality (Hello this is customer service, how may I help you) cheeky voice and patient demeanor.

I’m afraid of leaving my house sometimes. I’m afraid of being utterly alone, and I am afraid of getting panic attacks in public. I’m afraid of everything nowadays, as the slightest mistake has the possibility of ruining my life. Sometimes I’m afraid that people think I don’t want to hang out with them. No, I simply hate the process of calling off work, getting my parents to drive me (I don’t want to drive myself, as although I would like more freedom, I am afraid of independence. What if I get lost, or killed in an accident), and hoping that plans do not get canceled despite my preparation. These anxious thoughts only lead to depression, depressed that I am alone in this world and my only companion besides my family (who I don’t talk to about my mental state in worries of getting them worried) and my friends who I barely ever see is my constantly babbling mind”.",04Jul2019,14

I've offered my perspective and experience below, no need to read it to comment yours but it might be interesting.

Hope y'all have a good day :)




Here's my perspective: I've been in 14 times, long term and short, and oof it's been a wild ride. I've been thinking a lot about how the system is a little bit broken, and here's my thoughts. Initially, I went to a place that has since been charged with insurance farming. So yeah I was there for like 2.5 weeks after a 72 hour hold. Didn't realize at the time that that was really bad. I won't get into detail on the rest just thought that one stood out. A couple were good though don't get me wrong. I've been misdiagnosed and medicated for said misdiagnosis probably 7-8 times. The worst part is when I started having side effects of the medication after leaving. I've gained 5 new meds within 3 days, and I think a lot of this issue comes down to lack of long term care. Many people I've met have issues so complex that by the end of 3-6 days in short term, the doctors still don't know what's up. I've met people who have been misdiagnosed just so they can be discharged. And 3-6 days is never enough time for accurately choosing a medicine that works. Maybe PRNs. However, short term care has been great for me when I report 10/10 suicidal ideation and need to go in to have a place to calm down, then leave. In these times, there were no med changes, and I already understood my condition. But this was like 4 times. The other times I really needed some long term care. And I eventually got it hooray :) at the low low price of all my parents savings. Half of it got reimbursed, but the flaw with the system is that almost no one has enough saved to pay it, even with promise of full reimbursement. There are facilities for schizophrenia that are covered, a family friend went to many of these, but for many conditions, at least in the US, nothing exists. And I can owe my life to long term care, no exaggeration there. In the best case scenario, I'd still be going inpatient a week every month like I did for a half year before residential. And I've met a woman in her 50s who's been doing just that. 150 hospitalizations. So idk in my opinion, short term hospitals can be good for a calm down period. 2-5 days. And there need to be long term options available to anyone with referral from a psychiatrist. Because some people need to be examined for a long time to get a clear picture, and might need 6 months worth of knowledge to face the world. 

On a good note, I've met lots and lots of amazing people in hospitalization. I always get more from sharing stories and advice with patients than from group classes. Good food too lol.",04Jul2019,2
43,"i feel nothing and empty, but at the same time sad/angry that i feel this way and just wish i did not have a cynical and negative view of the world... it feels irreversible

but at the same time i feel like it is because life, even go this that have “the best” has no value... yet i am still consumed by it through social media, it feels like an addiction even though i rarely post

Either there isn't time or he doesn't like the meds, no one will see him or he's not comfortable etc. I'm not the pushy type and forcing it will make it worse.

46,"I’m in the uk, so easy to get appointments at the Dr’s but don’t know if it’s something I should go to them with as I’m nervous about bringing it up.

About 2 months ago my long term girlfriend was diagnosed with osteosarcoma (bone cancer) in her leg. Obviously since then it’s been a rollercoaster of emotions, from having the biopsy come back and confirmed it’s cancer at the lowest point and after scan results came back and we were told it was only in her leg and hasn’t spread been about as happy as we could be.

I feel like I had been taking all of this quite well. Managers at work are quite supportive giving me time off that I need. Good friend group and family support. 

But the last 2 weeks or so I just seem to be feeling worse and worse in my self. I usually talk to my girlfriend about such problems but I don’t feel like I can tell her how I feel about what’s happening as it will just upset her and give her something else to worry about on top of her chemo and results.
 
I feel like some of the way I’m feeling might be to do with lack of sleep. I wake up at 4am for work, finish at 1:30pm then go to the hospital till about 7pm ish and back home for 8pm and in bed again for 10ish but then find my mind can’t shut off for hours which leaves me really tired the next day. 

On top of tiredness I’ve been finding quite large mood swings, one second I will be happy with something that’s happening and the next I need to go to the car or bathroom at work as I feel like I just need to cry or be on my own. 

I have recently had a bit more work load out on me as well which is making me stress about work more than normal.

I feel like there isn’t anything a doctor could do to help with any of this as it’s just normal to feel like this in this situation.  I feel like telling people is just going to cause more stress on everyone else around me and just don’t know what to do.",04Jul2019,0

This makes me a little anxious (but not really to be frank) because that year will probably turn into a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

The vast majority of my time is spent rocking back and forth, listening to music for whatever emotional state I want to generate, and half-consciously playing Tetris while imagining alternate universes, complete with entire cosmologies, pantheons, and characters played by both entities in dreams and people I've met in real life. When I'm not doing that, I usually just wander around for miles, sometimes when it's extremely early in the morning.  


Usually I visualize more abstract imagery when that happens... colorful eternal machines but sometimes I imagine these psuedo-philosophical scenarios about being morally conflicted. Often times I'm a character in these stories, usually a minor 'villain' or an onlooker that's chronicling everything.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my entire life and I feel like I'm wasting it. So, is there any way to get out of this? Really, it's silent agony to place so much emphasis on this fantasy world that no one will ever witness.

50,"I love her dearly but she cant maintain appropriate behaviour. She knows she has some mental health issues as shes told me but she doesnt know what it is or how to help it, and neither do I.

I wont go into the ins and outs of our relationship itself but needless to say she has serious trust issues and a constant need for attention and acknowledgement. 

We are together 24/7 apart from when at work, and I dont have a problem with that, but I know its not normal. If I want to see a friend she isnt exactly happy, not that she would stop me but she isnt happy about it unless she is seeing her friends.

She will make plans with her friends irregardless of what I want, and no I never even try to stop her because we should be able to have friends, yet when I try to do the same and she has no plans herself then its an issue.

In my last relationship I was able to say that I want to go play a game for a while, sit on my computer and we both did separate things but together, entertaining ourselves, it was a 5 year relationship, and in my eyes that was healthy to an extent, yet with this lady if I was to say sorry I want to play my game for a few hours she would see it as me not wanting her anymore, I wouldnt even dream of asking such a thing with her, she would think its me not being interested in her anymore, or so on and so forth. Its not normal.

This morning and the last few weeks each time she tries to do something to progress her career (i wont say what) she keeps being reminded of something from her pas, something in my mind is minor and really not a big deal if you think about it like a normal person, but she goes off on a different tangent, getting angrier and angrier, and I sit there and listen and try to calm her but nothing I say helps, so I stop saying things and just nod along, but she doesnt stop. 

I understand peoples need to vent but she vents about the same issues again and again endlessly, I keep saying she cant keep dwelling on it and letting it stop her from moving forward but she keeps going back to it and it only makes her angrier.

One minute she is ready to discard her parents because of what they did to her, which really wasnt that bad, and then later when she calms down she is fine with them again. 

Im not sure what is wrong with her but I just find it so difficult to try and calm her down? I dont know how to help her?

I feel like she is ruining her own life at this point. She has goals and plans and she keeps stopping herself by getting angry about her past when shes reminded of it and then goes off on a tangent until the next day nearly, and never makes any progress in reaching those goals or plans. 

Even the goals themselves, she desperately wants to reach them but she isnt putting any effort in. Im helping her. Then I get to the point of making progress with her in reaching them and suddenly she will be reminded of something and go off venting again for hours, stopping all progress and setting it all back. Shes nearly 30 now as well and I just really worry that whatever is wrong with her is going to stop her ever being happy?",04Jul2019,1

54,"trigger warning: pretty gross, picking skin and biting nails. Nothing too graphic though

Ok so weird question and definitely tmi but I've started doing something lately and I'm wondering if I have a problem here...

I've started picking at the tough skin on my heels and toes. I think it started because I was frustrated with how much tough skin there was, and from then I kept doing it because the previous picking made little edges to grab on to. I use my nails and a little seam ripper to pull off bits of skin off. The biggest patch right now is about 5cm/2inch across. I hesitate to call it self harm because I never continue beyond the point where it hurts, I only pull off the numb tough layers of skin. But of course that tough skin does have a purpose so it does make my feet kind of sore when I walk. 

I have heard of skin picking being a disorder but I also don't neccesarily feel like I have that, because the image I have of that is of people doing it in more obvious places like their face and really wounding themselves. (am I not wounding myself? I'm unsure).

Some important context that is really making me wonder if this is something I should be worrying about is that while I haven't always picked at my feet I do have a pretty long history of biting skin. When I was a teenager/maybe child even I started biting my nails very excessively to the point that my nails were as short as the could be and I had chewed off a lot of the skin around the fingertips as well. I managed to stop doing this by wearing nail polish (although I still occasionally bite the skin right next to my nails when I am very stressed). At some point in university I started biting the inside of my cheecks and lips. This is a lot less noticeable to other people so I don't feel any social pressure to stop. Here too I only bite the very top layer of the skin that doesn't hurt when I do, but it ofter leaves my mouth feeling very rough on the inside. I notice it's a lot worse when I'm stressed, and I often do it without noticing. Now with me feet though I feel like I'm not stressed and it's more out of boredom. 

I feel like I sound super crazy describing this but at the same time I can't help but feel like it's really not a big deal and I don't really have to stop. Does anyone have any experience with any of this, I'm pretty lost. 
I feel like I could quit picking at my feet if I wanted to but I've been trying to stop biting my lips and I can't so far.",04Jul2019,4

But on this occasion, I believe I am not. My dad has brought me up, taught me how to read, ride a bike, took me to all my various lessons growing up, really pushed me and showed me the importance of education. I had the perfect upbringing, and went without nothing. He has supported me when things with my mum have gone wrong. And yes I am grateful. But am I wrong for not wanting to praise him? For doing what a parent should do? But he believes because he taught me how to read as a toddler, that as a father he “demands respect”, so therefore I should tolerate his behaviour. I should listen to him when he screams at me saying I should give up, That I can’t do it anyways. Sending me abusive texts saying how “pathetic” I am for relying on medication to get through the day. That my dead nan who was my heart and soul would be disgusted in the person I am. That I would be nothing without him. He laughs in my face when I’m having a break down. He talks down to me. He berates me. 

This is the man who watched me having a breakdown on a hospital floor, because he would not admit the nasty things he said to me, he told me it was all in my head, that he never said anything. He let the hospital take me in, knowing their aim was to section me because I had tried to kill my self. When I was discharged, he then admitted that he said everything that he previously denied. And said I deserved to hear all those nasty things, and I need to think about what I did to make him say them. When I questioned why he would do that and if he thinks he’s done something wrong? He smiles and says no, it’s what I get. 

He will still do that now. He will manipulate me. He will have sudden memory loss. He will antagonise me. But he taught me how to read though. And I would be nothing without him though.

59,"Hey,

well, I am feeling void and alone right now and don't know what to do.

I've been thinking about calling a helpline for a few days, but everytime I have the strength and motivation to actually call I don't feel I need it enough to take up the time that could be used helping someone who is worse than I am. I don't want to be an attention seeking asshole.

On the other hand I don't know what to do and how to get out of this laziness or through this lack of motivation. I only have about 2 weeks left to write my final paper and just can't get my lazy self to work on it.

I don't even want to bother my psychiatrist to sign a paper that would give me some more time; you can apply for extra time when you are ill for a significant amount of time during the assigned working time; because I feel like it is my fault. I could have started earlier instead of just wasting my time watching youtube, sleeping or playing games. At the same time I don't know how to stop being so lazy... My medication doesn't help, and the doc doesn't think more or another would work either.

I want to start therapy with an other doctor I feel more connected with, but also feel like I don't deserve to be so picky because I don't plan killing or even hurting myself at all. Also why I don't feel I deserve to call the helpline; I'm just so indifferent.

Even answering the question ""How are you?"" is hard to answer because I don't know. I don't feel anything, not even myself/my own body at times. I don't feel great sure, but I also don't feel bad just; I feel like I feel nothing in regards to myself.

I do feel love towards my partner, our pets, friends and family, I also feel empathy, hate, disgust, joy etc, I laugh and find things genuinly funny, but ... I just don't feel me and it sometimes terrifies me how distant I feel and seem to be from myself and my body at times. So much so, that I have a hard time moving my body or speaking or even feeling un- or surreal and whatever I do doesn't have an impact on reality, like I am in a game and whatever I do doesn't have real consequences.

I can't pay rent or bills and I have already asked a small loan of 200 from my dad. My boyfriend lives a very nice lifestyle and I've tried to keep up - the difference is he works at a well paying job. He doesn't seem to understand what it's like to be poor or  unemployed and I'm not blaming him but it makes me feel a bit alone with my problems. 

I stopped going to my psychiatrist couple of months ago because everything was going great and my depression is gone. I just don't know how to handle stress. I don't want to return to psychiatric help because I have went back and forth so much already. In the end, the problems are always small but in my head they always seem so huge that I feel like falling apart. 

It feels like everything is piling up so much that I lose control of my life and I hate asking for help. I want to survive on my own but it's difficult. Right now I'd just want a drink or two and some good company.

TLDR: I have a lot going on with studying (=working for clients from school for free) atm, I don't have any income and it's making me scared.

64," It’s not easy to be a young person in today’s chaotic and constantly changing world. Dealing with the burdens of our over-stressed, over-committed society — all while trying to grow, develop, and find happiness can lead to emotional overload.

That’s rough stuff when you’re just starting out in the world.

These numbers might sound scary, but there are ways to help our kids develop coping strategies that can improve their **mental health** and help boost the effectiveness of any other treatments.

**1. An Evidence-Based Approach**

Modern medicine has come a long way in treating psychological issues; finding skilled and compassionate psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists can help young people get better. Finding the right doctor is key; they need to be able to connect with their patients and offer tools and knowledge that support positive change. In addition to traditional treatments, there are support programs that have been proven to be extremely effective.

65,"I'm 24 years old and keep making mistakes; I'm not sure what to do.

I slowly lost contact with my childhood friends when I went to university, and then lost my uni friends when I dropped out... I've tried to reach out, but it's been over 3 years at this point. I'm a distant memory. The last time I spoke to anyone who wasnt a stranger or colleague was new years eve.

I dropped out of university after I was mugged. I became scared to go outside and missed lectures. My partner who I'd been with since I was 13 found someone else and left abruptly, I don't really blame her. I was a mess.

I've lost all confidence in myself, I know that I'm still young, but I look to my sister and my old friends lives, and they all have friends, partners, houses, jobs. I have nothing. I moved back home after uni and found job after job that I'm bad at. I've stopped really having Hope's and dreams because I dont see a point anymore, it'll never go anywhere.

I'm still trying to fix things, I'm starting university in September again, in a different field. I'm not good enough to be an artist like I dreamed of, so I picked something that will get me a job afterwards, but now I like I'm heading in the wrong direction, art was the only thing that brought me happiness, but now I just look at my drawings with disgust. 

I'm hoping that someone, anyone will want to be my friend at uni. But I doubt it. Even right now I'm on holiday, but my mum and sisters are spending alone time with their partners, so im by myself, I dont blame them, but it's sad that this is how I spend every day of my life; alone

67,"My mind work in a funny way sometimes, like coming out with random songs and then asking around if someone was playing it or singing it, seeing random people faces and getting hit by a fake deja vu that I just saw this person face all day long, it especially happens as I fall asleep, my mind plays complex symbolic scenarios or stuff that I feel should urgently remember but then, it's just another fake deja vu

Sometimes I definitely think I'm stupid because I can't think straight like others or my reasoning it's always kinda messy and all over the place, like I can get to the point from A to B but at the same time not remembering/considering how the road from A to B is. I have 0 social skills and sometimes can't talk properly, or my voice comes off weird or what I say doesn't really make sense. Sometimes talking also bores me, I can't never deepen the connections with others

I don't know how to function in the world outside of myself. Don't know what to do with my hands, with my eyes, what to look at, what to pay attention to, what to think, I feel so dizzy.. so lethargic, it's a lot easier to just zone out and think to nothing in particular,o to worlds salads like often happens to me. 

I can't even make sense of my feelings, sometimes they're too intense for trivial things and almost nonexistent in other moments, I am always angry for something and imagine myself mentally lashing out or beating others, I can be too fucking dramatic, but as usual, not even this can come out of myself

This usually happens at night a few times a week, and I end up crying myself to sleep feeling like I want to die. On the other hand, usually as the day goes on my spirits lift and I realise that I was being very over dramatic and got upset about pointless things. When I get panicky and upset I tend to start convincing myself that my boyfriend doesn’t like me and I start saying that I don’t want to be in a relationship. This isn’t true at all, but when I feel like this I get taken over by this complete sadness and panic that everything my life is bad and I feel as though I have to ruin everything. When I wake up I usually feel really depressed, apologise to my boyfriend and hope he doesn’t think I’m crazy and then I usually feel better as the day goes on. It’s a cycle that’s been happening for months and I have no idea why or how to stop this. I’m 19 and I have severe anxiety and have suffered from PTSD in the past due to almost losing my dad. I’m on 10mg of citalopram but I’m not sure if that is enough, it doesn’t seem to be making me any less anxious anymore. Any thoughts or help would be appreciated, I feel very confused.",04Jul2019,1

I have always told myself and others that you have to make work out of what you love, but actually I don’t love anything. None of the distractions I remotely enjoy can be turned into professions, and I feel like my entire generation is desperately trying to keep their heads above a sea of depression, anxiety, stress and other mental health issues. I don’t have enough money for therapy, I fell out with all my friends and don’t care enough to try making new ones or connecting with old ones. Since I need money to live and I need to work to have money and I can’t handle full time work, I guess that means I may as well just die, except I wouldn’t want to upset my mum.

They are in a very stressful job and I believe they are also still grieving from the very sudden and unexpected death of a close family member a year ago; however, how they respond to more conventionally minor stressors and particularly how strongly they react to minor disagreeements between us is getting increasingly difficult to deal with.

It is seriously affecting me and I am struggling to cope with the verbal, emotional and occasional physical abuse. I know them to be a wonderful person but that person rarely comes out, they spend all their spare time in bed, I feel like I must constantly walk on eggshells around them, and despite suggesting they seek help (and having suggested this for over two years), I am constantly rebuffed and told that they can handle it and that a counsellor isn't needed. I believe they think mental illness is something to be ashamed of.

I was wearing high waisted shorts and a crop top... some guy decided to comment “nice gut” even though... I’m literally 90lbs and can’t even push out a gut it I tried. It was the angle of the picture and now every time I look at it all I see is fat... I fucking hate that I let him get to me. I tried so hard to ignore it but I can’t.

75,"Long story: My mom divorced my dad and remarried when I was 3. My stepdad was abusive, both physically and emotionally. I was bullied a school but after a while I managed to make friends that helped me get the bullies to fuck off.  I was happy for a few years despite my abusive household, but that all went to shit. Most of my friendships went to shit after a stupid argument, the rest we drifted apart after I moved to a new city. Broke up with my girlfriend and on top of that, I’ve been rejected by every girl ive had feelings for since then. At my new school, the bullying was just as bad as the old school. 

Now that I no longer had my friends to keep my mind away from my shit home I started to break down. I suffered from depression and anger issues. My mental state only got worse from there. I hated myself, I blamed myself for every shit thing that happened in my life, I self harmed and attempted suicide on more than one occasion. I wanted to be in the past so bad that I started to break from reality. I started living in a world where I was still with my old friends. I ended up having a near death experience after a surgery gone wrong. This snapped me back into reality. When I eventually realised that my ideal world wasn’t real, that there was no going back to the way things used to be something inside of me snapped.

I felt absolutely furious for a moment, I felt like I was going to explode. I wanted to murder the people who I felt were to blame for my misfortune. That feeling of rage overwhelmed me, for that moment that was all I felt. Then something else snapped. I felt a sudden calm come over me, my ears where ringing. I felt nothing. The anger was still there, but I wasn’t feeling it, it was just there to keep my going as a fuel if that makes sense. I felt nothing for others, I could’ve killed a person and not felt anything about it. I felt like this for about a year. I had become a ruthless and cold shadow of my former self. I played games with people at school, students and teachers alike. I manipulated people, be it through emotions, blackmail or threats, and I enjoyed it, it was one of the only things in my life that gave me any pleasure. 

Due to this, I ended up in many physical fights at school. I rarely started them, they’d normally start due to me having pushed someone over the edge. I’d goad the the other person into throwing the first punch so I wouldn’t get in trouble. After that I’d attack with everything I had punching, kicking, head butting, strangling, eye gouging until the fight had been broken up. When I was on the losing end of a fight, I actually enjoyed the pain. I would laugh after a beat down as the pain would actually feel pleasurable. I felt absolutely no remorse, even though I had blatantly tried to kill people on a few occasions. I had even gone as far as to plan to kill my stepdad, though I didn’t go through with it out of fear of getting caught.

I went on like this until I got a text in the middle of the night. This guy that I’d been manipulating and bullying had sent a suicide note to just about everyone in the year. The moment I read that text I broke out of that fucked up mindset instantly. I was reminded of my past struggles with suicide and was overcome with remorse. I managed to talk this guy out of killing himself. After this, I promised myself that I would be a better person. 

So far, I’m glad to say it’s been working. I became good friends with this guy afterwards, and made many other great friends once I had let go of my hate. While I still suffer from occasional depressive waves, overall I enjoy my life. My friends support me, and are probably the main reason I haven’t slipped back into my old way of thinking when things got hard.

77,"Hi guys, long time lurker, but first time poster.

&amp;#x200B;

4 years ago, something traumatic happened that shook me at my core. The details, i believe, are not of importance, but  long story short: I was an idiot, had unprotected sex, girl got pregnant, turned out to be some other guys child, but i was shocked profoundly and experienced quite a bit of trauma, stress and anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

After a good while being depressed and paranoid, talking to my doctors, and the girl, i was left with no doubt at all as to the situation: Biologically it was impossible for me to be involved, so i was left with a lesson for life, that i took to heart, and slowly got better and forgot. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year around winter feelings of paranoia, and dark thoughts surrounding this incident in my life came back to me, something that has bothered me for a few months, getting considerably better, and then again worse this week where i have been alone at home for a week (girlfriend is traveling).  This probably stems from being alone with my thoughts. I have had councelling at a therapist during the spring, which i felt was good for me, but feelings of depression, and slight paranoia/anxity have a tendency to creep in in my daily life, significantly overshadowing my good mood. For instance, watching television i keep associating my situation to people and things i see on screen constantly reminding me of this scare. Thinking about traveling (something i very much enjoy) saddens me as i worry my thought will ruin my experiences in the future. A couple of days ago i fell into a deep paranoid spiraling thought scheme about closure, and lack thereof probably left me hanging in this scare, but the only concrete closure (aside from doctors words, and facts that make my involvement practically impossible) i can think of is a DNA test. I know this would rule me out, but i don't want to consider this an option as i don't believe anything good would come of it, for me, or the parents.

&amp;#x200B;

All this probably stems from a deep ingrained feeling in my subconciousness that i ruined my life and that something will catch up to me down the line. I know my thoughts are very irrational, as i can convince myself of the truth (that is very much grounded in facts!), and there really should be nothing to worry about, so i am left wondering why i feel this way? Why has these feelings emerged again, and why do i have a hard time shaking them off again and forgetting. I have no contact whatsoever with firstmentioned girl or family, as she lives across country, and there is really nothing that could leave me to believe there is anything that relates to me.   


So, i guess i am here looking for comfort or advice. How can i move on? I keep telling my self facts, thinking about my future as a bright and happy one, trying to stay rational, but i feel stressed, and sometimes depressed.

78,"The body language of someone with a mental health condition is often misunderstood. There is little control over poster (i.e., walking, sitting standing), facial expression, cadence (i.e., voice volume, pitch and speed) or hand expressions. Yes, we try to control these reflections, but it is brief no matter the strength of the effort. These are not bad habits that can be unlearned. Uncontrolled spontaneous thoughts easily run wild. Sometimes we catch the words before they leave our mouth. Other times the words get hung up in our mind and body language takes over. This piece of living with a mental health condition may be the reason this population cannot hold down a steady job. We often end up isolated and misunderstood. Disability benefits become essential to survival. Without food, shelter and some shred of companionship, it is easy to give up and just stop functioning altogether.  

I remember struggling with being constantly misunderstood at my full-time job. I had been there more than 10 years yet so many people just did not get who I was really was until they had a live conversation (not through email) with me that lasted more than the polite early morning 'good morning, how are you?' I felt self-conscious walking down the hall with someone approaching or behind me. I was called on how I appeared to others several times by my boss. I needed to 'project a happy demeanor' so other staff would not think I was angry. Time spent on the job meant that I had to be on guard of my verbal and non-verbal behavior at all times, lest it be written up on my performance review. Well it ended on there anyway. Nothing I tried was a success. I just 'held myself in check' every time I walked through the front doors and did not release until I was back in my car driving home. It was exhausting.  

We don't have to smile and appear to others as they would like, even if it is your employer. There is, of course, a line no employee should cross but, in actuality, our employer is renting our behavior while we are on the clock. They are not free to change us but have great freedom to fire someone when the employment agreement is 'hire or fire at will.' That is commonplace in today's work arena.

82,"Hey everyone,  
so a really good friend of mine is on the verge of a serious mental breakdown and I am at the point where I can no longer sit by and watch her descent into madness, but don't know how to best stage an intervention or something of that nature.  
She has been plagued by serious medial (non-psychological) issues, which required her to have operations in the last few years and have required her to take lots of different medication with different side effects (wild swings in body weight for examples). I'm sure her physical problems play into her mental state and the two are connected, but that is an non-educated guess of mine.  
Additionally she has a rather stressful job where she has no friends and feels being put under a lot of pressure.  


All of that has resulted in paranoid fantasies. She feels targeted and attacked by an online-mob who harasses her with ""subliminal messages"" on various social media platforms. I have for a long time tried to give her and her stories the benefit of doubt, but I am now sure that this is all in her head. She thinks that people are targeting her, hacking into her phone and computer, monitoring every step she does and I have never seen a shroud of evidence that any of this is actually happening. Classic paranoia stuff.   


I have begged her several times to just quit Twitter, Instagram and all of that, but she never manages to stay off it for longer than a few weeks (during those periods she always improves). She is addicted to that world. She works in journalism and she thinks that her colleagues put subliminal messages in the newspaper headlines to spite and hurt her. She literally thinks that the newspaper is all about her and people trying to make fun of her.  


Over the years this has been sometimes better, sometimes worse and I always hoped that it will improve/fade away once she has a different work environment and the problems with her physical health lie behind her. I have begged her to quit her job (which she hates) but she just doesn't do it. In her mind, she doesn't want to admit defeat to her haters (the online-mob that harasses her) and that misguided sense of pride keeps her in her position.  
Nevertheless I always hoped that she would snap out of it at some point and just realize that she needs to change sth., which will turn things for the better.

Until last night.   
That's when we met up and for the first time she told me about her ""secret superpowers"". That she has the gift of premonition, can predict the future and can hurt people telepathically if she wants to. She told me that she's been in a telepathic war with her colleagues and has ""slapped her boss in the face"" using a telepathic attack and that people might now be on to her and start attacking her because of her ""gift"". Full-blown crazy-talk.   
That's when the alarm bell in my head, which had been ringing for quite a while, reached a new volume-level and I realized that something needs to happen soon before this escalates further.  


But what can I do? She is adamant that she's not crazy, of course. When I carefully suggested in the past that it might be something that's not real and it might be good to talk to someone (professionally), she always immediately flew off the rails, screaming that it's all real and that she doesn't want to be ""locked up or put away"". I can't really talk to her parents because I don't think they would deal with it in the right way (they are rural folk who still think people with mental issues are just crazy and need to be locked up in a padded room (basically a 19th century-view of mental issues).

See, when she left me last year and I later found out that she was a cheat, this sub helped me clarify a lot of my thoughts and helped me out.

Me and my ex talk on occasion. Only ever when it's about the cats, or the car really. It's what I would call civil but not really friendly. 

We were talking the other day, and she told me (actually in the context of the conversation, so I don't think she was using this to score points) that her anxiety has worsened to the point wheres she's tried to end her own life on several occasions.

Now, considering her initial main motivation for wanting to leave me was that she was unhappy, for her to say that she's worse now is strange. 

I'm weirdly (selfishly) glad that she's not happy. Especially given that she's Facebook offcial with the guy she cheated on me with! I'm miserable 90% of the time cause of her actions, I guess I'd feel worse knowing she was happy with him!

At the same time though, I'm really worried about her. 
She left me. My feelings for her didn't just up and go away. Sure, I thought/think that she's a dick, but I never stopped loving her.

I don't want her back. But I want to be able to offer my support. The last thing I want is to get a phonecall from her parents one day saying she's done something stupid.  I don't know how I'd react to that.

Everywhere I look and everyone I'm around I feel like I'm being targeted or they are out to get me. Alcohol makes it better at the time ( mainly numbs me , and makes me not give a shit ) but the following days after I fall into depression. Why do I have these thoughts? Why do I wake up and see people around me when no one's there? Why can't I trust a single soul in this world ? 
I look at some of these others young adults and they seem to nieve and happy and open to everything. Well I'm closed off and worried that everyone is trying to kill me.

Currently I am struggling with my Mental Health, I'm 26 and I have been struggling with depression since I was around 14, raised in a violent and alcoholic family, watching my father beat and strangulate his partners to an inch of their life once my parents divorced.. as soon as I was 18 I moved out without a choice and since I have just been going.. I live alone and I've not been able to maintain friendships or relationships. I'm an over-thinker, generally confident when I am doing things but as soon as I stop anxiety starts to crumble me apart.

Recently I have noticed my behaviours become a bit more explicit, feeling completely detached from my self and my existence.

I'm not exactly sure what to do to get rid of this feeling of being broken and do not consider what a future for me looks like.

I am not sure what help I am seeking.

(I have a fear of developing schizophrenia because I think I fit some of the schizotypal symptoms, I do plan on going to a psychiatrist to discuss all of this but too expensive atm) 

Basically, I was just now thinking of making a family tree and I was thinking how I could draw it out or if I could just use an online free family tree maker, but I was uncomfortable with that and my first thought was ""omg what if the governments watching over stuff like that and is using it to gather information about us.""

I haven’t gotten in trouble with the police for a while and I have only done drugs once or twice during this times of happiness. 

However things are starting to change again. The voices are coming back. I don’t want to do anything. All I can think about is running away or hurting myself in some way. I’m feeling depressed again. And I hate it. I’m terrified to go outside and the only thing that made me feel even an ounce of joy today was a huge dog sat on my lap. 

The doctors are also convinced that I have OCD but They are wrong. They keep trying to tell me I’m paranoid but again they’re wrong. I have to keep lying to them otherwise bad things will happen and everything will fall apart. I can’t let anyone know what is actually happening otherwise they will punish me.

Something they do in films. Same with kissing. I have never kissed. I don't understand why people do it. Do they even do it? It seems surreal too.

Many times it made me not eat at all, or just eat a bread and ham or something like that. I would eat about 500kcal a day. Sometimes over 2000kcal but it was mostly just carbs and sugar - since I didn't know what to eat I would just buy anything simple like cookies and sasuage or whatever.

One day left side of large intestine has started to hurt. It still does sometimes. It's ""twisting"" or whatever. My stomach is flatulent/pumped all the time (with little to no gases). You can see vains on my stomach because of it. I've lost my appetite. I've lost 25 pounds in 2 weeks. I went to 7 doctors. I'm going to have ultrasound of my stomach and also colonoscopy + gastroscopy. I will have to spend 1/3 of my salary on it. And more on meds.

I don't know if I have a virus that caused this, or is it just from anxiety. Anyone had similar issue? I'm sick of it. I want to eat pizza or whatever I want. Now I can't. I'm taking a probiotics which helps, but I'm still not cured. Sometimes I want to order a pizza and big cola and just eat it all and drink it all and fuck my life.

I'm just a lab assistant in a hospital doing tedious but important work for hours. It's an important stepping stone job, and so far the only way I've managed to deal with working long hours was by watching Twitch videos or listening to podcasts on my phone. But recently I made a mistake at the job because of this distraction, which is a very big deal, and my manager and department are really against me watching stuff on my phone while working. 

The problem is, I NEED this sort of entertainment. I start having really bad, ruminating, depressing thoughts, and this has happened with every job I've had. And the job gets really really boring and stressful. The idea of being able to watch stuff on my phone was my ONLY way to motivate myself to go to work, not the job itself. It makes time go by faster and doesnt feel like I'm slaving away at a job, which is what any form of work feels like to me.

I dont know what to do. It's against hospital policy to have my phone out, so I cant contest that. But because I work second shift and the managers are out, I was able to get away with it.

114,"I am currently struggling with a situation involving my partner of 4 years.

I was told from the beginning that he has schizophrenia, which I accepted and was something I had experience in due to a past job, so wasn’t something that worried me too much.

Three weeks ago he suddenly stopped taking his meds and was acting very strangely - was getting angry at people and then deciding suddenly he was going to quit his job and start studying. He shouted at his mum because she turned the kitchen light on, he never gets angry so it’s strange for him to get angry anyway let alone over something so small.

The next day when I realised he was acting strange, I took him to the doctors who suggested he increased his meds. Not only did he refuse to do this, he also refused to take them at all - this he has never ever done. I spent the next 10 hours begging/pleading him to take them. Nothing worked and then he suddenly decided to break up with me and seemed overly happy about it, almost laughing at me. He then went off and wandered around town talking to homeless people and laughing to himself. I was in contact with his friend who I knew was going to meet him and they later called an ambulance. I went to hospital and he was in full blown psychosis, he was signing, laughing, running away, screaming...all sorts. It was scary.

He was sectioned and remained in hospital for one week. He broke up with me on numerous occasions during that time, all for different reasons (he doesn’t want what I want, I deserve better, I’m not clever enough for him, he’s in love with Sophie which is a girl he had a failed one night stand with 10 years ago and also became a voice, and now he’s blaming me for becoming unwell as well as making out he’s too good for me and feels amazing without me)

He was discharged from hospital and refused to come home. He has gone to stay with a friend and he is being very cold towards me and very grandiose. He doesn’t want his job, his relationship, his home... nothing of his previous life.

He is usually so loving towards me, and he was recently telling people he was saving up for an engagement ring. We had also been looking in to buying our first home together. It’s gone from this to him showing no love or care towards me at all and almost becoming the opposite to the man I know.

I have been looking up loads about bipolar and I’m wondering if this is a manic episode? He’s on antipsychotics but no mood stabilisers. I feel like I’m in limbo, not knowing whether to move on or wait, or how long to wait.

Boyfriend of almost 7 years has struggled with his mental health his whole life, and for as long as I have known him. I have always been aware and tried to help where I can, I struggle with stress and anxiousness myself however I know it is not on the same level as him. 

Over the past few months we have both acknowledged that his mental health has been deteriorating due to a number of factors. To avoid identifying details, I'm just going to summarise that he now lives in the UK over 500 miles away from his family so visiting them is difficult, and that his mum is clinically depressed, has attempted suicide, and he has not been coping well with the stress of the situation. His work has been high pressure recently too.

He was signed off for a couple of weeks from work for stress, and after his breakdown at work we agreed that he needed professional help, so he now has therapy sessions with the NHS. I'm glad that he is getting professional help and knew that he needed to take some time for himself, but now he is back at work I worry about him relapsing. He can get anxious easily but triggers have been getting smaller and less significant recently and he's been making more and more off-the-cuff comments about hurting himself when he is stressed/having an episode. These are things he has said before as jokes but I have noticed the change in tone. I know it is something he has bought up in his sessions but obviously it still scares me and I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to help him.

I'm trying to make sure we stick to our normal routine during the week so we have more freedom on the weekends to keep things structured, but is there anything else I can do for our home life to help support him? I love this boy and it hurts and scares me to see him go through this, so if there is anything anyone can suggest to help when is feeling stressed or anxious I'll happily look into it!

123,"Yea, the title is really edgy. I'm really edgy. But it's really been what I've  been feeling. That's why I wrote this long post about my mental health.

I spend a disgusting amount of time online. It always prioritizes over my hobbies. I am a beginner artist, and drawing used to give me joy. However, now I lack any motivation to draw. I basically force myself to do it, and most of the time I give up half way into the drawing because I feel like it sucks.

Being online is a form of escapism for me. When my mom started drinking again, I would always camp out in the bathroom and watch YouTube videos. It seemd to suck out all the pain and anxiety, and sent me to another world. 

Even when I'm not online, most of what goes on in my head is fiction. Fictional characters, unrealistic futures for myself. Heck, sometimes when I'm going through crap I pretend as if it's happening to a fictional character and its like all my pain goes away. 

The internet, fantasy, and characters aren't the only thing that takes the pain away, though. Suicidal thoughts. Cutting. It's hard to believe such horrible things can help. I know they don't really help, but it feels like they do.

At first I blamed my pain on others. ""It's my mom's fault. She ruined my life by being a bipolar alcoholic, and making horrible choices."" or ""It's everyone's fault for being crappy judgmental people who don't care how their words and actions actions affect me!""

But now I realise I'm just a bad person. I hurt my mom badly so many times, and don't even feel guilty as I'm doing it. I've lost connections with all my friends, and I don't miss them, I just miss the attention. My social anxiety is so bad that it's hard just to walk by a stranger without wondering if I looked like a total freak. 

And as I started to realize that, things got worse. I spend more time online, I cut myself more, I'm more antisocial. Some days I eat noting at all, some days I eat too much. I hate my body. Sometimes I don't even get dressed or brush my hair.

I was originally suicidal because I thought of it as the ultimate revenge. I'm now suicidal because I can't stand the pain and guilt. Such selfish thoughts, and I don't even care. My happiness does not come from reality , so what's the point?",04Jul2019,1

125,"Today was the first day I actually tried to end my life in over 10 years.  


I have a wonderful loving boyfriend, and we're just getting ready to move in together.  
About two weeks ago I admitted myself to the local crisis center to try and get help.  
After talking to three councilors, creating a safety plan, and setting dates to start seeing a life coach, psychiatrist and group therapy.  
My first appointment is July 8.  


I had another breakdown this morning. I went to the local walk in clinic to try and talk to someone. Three hours later, I left, I didn't get to talk to anyone.  
I tried to follow the saftey plan.  
I tried to talk to my grandmother this morning. I tried to keep occupied and asked if she would like to do something together. She said No.  


So I went to the bathroom. Broke my razor, grabbed the razor blade and started slowly working my way up to it.  
I didn't start vertically right to the vein. I started vertically from the top of my arm, and started working my way over.  
My arm is a mess.  
Right efore I got to the ""right spot""  
I chickened out.  
I called my best friend, we talked a bit, I hung up.  


She suggested I show my family what I did, and all I was met with was, ""If you do it again, you're getting admitted.""  


  


I thought I was doing better.  
But, after scaring my boyfriend by telling him what I did, I'm afraid this is the end.  
Everyone has a breaking point, you know? He's going to leave because no one can put up with all my mood swings. And I don't blame them. He's amazing and deserves way better than me.  
I can barely hold a job, hell, I can barely keep myself together for a single day.  
But I'm tired. I'm SO tired.   
People always tell you to seek help, and for what? A bunch of resources? Some appointments 2 weeks later?  
It doesn't matter.  
It never matters.  
This is my life, and if I think it's time to quit who is anyone to tell me it's not?  
I just need the guts to finally do it.  
Two cuts. That's all I have to do.   
Just two.",04Jul2019,1

Nobody in my life knows i have this problem, I hide it well. On the outside I appear like I have my shit together. recent promotion, nice car, dress well, etc. Ive been like this for 4 years now. Im texting a girl that I really like but all i can think about is how fucked up I am and when she gets to know the real me, she'll leave. Im so lonely. I hate myself. I dont know what to do.

129,"I always seem to wind up getting into altercations with people around me and I was wondering if it might be a symptom of some possible mental issue I may have that anyone might have similar experiences with.  The last couple times were very recent as the last 2-3 days.  

&amp;#x200B;

One was with my new roommate who just moved in last weekend who I hadn't even formally met yet.  When I walked down stairs after I got off work to cook food I saw him and introduced myself and shook his hand then I looked in the refrigerator and I saw a mason jar with blackish liquid and all my stuff rearranged and one of my tupperware containers missing.  He said that when he was moving my stuff he dropped my barbecue sauce and poured it into the mason jar.  He said it broke from the bottom and that's how he poured it and and he got most of it.  I said what the fuck why were you moving my stuff and I said you fucked up my shit and I'm the one that has to replace that shit and the shit's expensive.   After I went upstairs after he left I went up there to and he was in the bathroom so I said outside of the bathroom don't touch my shit without asking me first.  To which he agreed and as I was going down the steps I said the shit\[s expensive and I'm the one that has to pay for it.  After a few minutes he came down and said he'd give me a couple bucks and he had $6 in his hand but I said no keep your money just don't touch my shit again without asking me.  A few minutes after I said that when he was in the kitchen I said but thanks for the gesture.  

&amp;#x200B;

Another situation is with another one of my other roommates.  I gave him $50 to get an 8th of weed for me and he gave me an 8th of CBD bud.  When he first gave it to me he said it was more of a body high and it'll take 2 hits to feel it.  We went into a conversation about indicas and sativas and he said it was more of an indica.  I said ok because I was going to see if maybe it did take 2 hits and a few days before that I had asked him if when he blows his nose in the shower if he could not get boogers of the walls or curtain and he said it's not boogers I think it's just some shit and we need to get a new shower curtain anyways I said ok and left it at that.  When I came downstairs a 2nd time he asked if I wanted a $10 of weed and I could pay him back.  I said I did want the weed but I'd pay him now and went and got my money and bought it.  It was good shit that's another reason I figured maybe it did take 2 hits for the weed to hit.  I smoked the whole 8th, bowl after bowl and got no type of high in fact it smoked like CBD bud.  I didn't immediately flip out or say or do anything and plus I don't really run into him often but I saw him that Monday and said that weed was  bullshit I smoked the whole thing and didn't get high at all and that it seemed like CBD bud and that I smoke CBD bud so I know what the fuck I'm talking about.  He was said that yeah it made him not really want to talk and the guy he got it from usually has good shit.  Since he was smoking at the time I said why don't you give me a hit of the bud and we'll call it even.  I pulls out the tiniest speck ever out of the 8th he has and I get it look at it laugh and say what's this here man and pass it back to him.  He said oh did you want t in the bong II didn't know how you wanted it.  Then he packs up the bong and passed it to me and it's and 1/4 of a regular size bowl.  I spark it and take the hit.  I'm talking shit as I'm doing all this.  Saying things about it being CBD bud and I know CBD bud and that I must look bitchmade if he's  going to try and get over on me.  He starts to say he knows lots of people he can sell it to and I said wow scamming high school students huh?  and he said yeah there's this guy at my job that's buy anything I can sell it to him.  So I said oh yeah, I got some baking soda and Advil you can sell him to and he laughed.  I was getting done talking and turned to leave I span back around and said give me another hit of that weed and this time a proper bowl and none of that quarter bowl bullshit the fuck am I gonna do with that.  He gave me a thumbs up and started packing the bowl when he gave it to me it was a proper bowl.  As he was doing this he kept talking about going to sell the weed to the kid at his job.  I just said ok, ok, ok.  After I took the hit I said something I can't remember but as I was going upstairs and he was putting in eyedrops I poked him in the stomach and said you motherfucker and then went upstairs.  I was high as fuck laying in my bed after deciding to skip dinner I didn't really want to fuck up my high and the new guy moved in that day and I didn't want to meet the new guy in the kitchen as high as I was.  After 5-10 minutes my roommate came upstairs and knocked on my door and said yeah he talked to the guy he's gonna sell it to him for $25.  I said ok is that is?  I said why did he knock on my door there's no emergency he could have said that from downstairs.  He said my bad he talks a lot when he's high.  He left and about 20 minutes after came back and said he'd give me some of the money from what he sells to the kid and that he's not stupid.  I said yeah ok and waved my finger at him.  The day after that he had left $10 under my door.

&amp;#x200B;

Today's situation is with this girl at my work.  The majority of workers at my job are Hispanic and speak Spanish and I don't.  I've only been there about 2-3 weeks.  When I was standing in the back room talking to the girl I work with another Mexican girl came in and said something at me and then looked and talked to the other girl.  It's obvious she was saying something about me and in their tone of voice it felt like they were talking crap about me.  I went ahead and left the backroom and started working and when the other girl left I asked the girl that works with me what that girl had said and she said nothing she's crazy, and I asked was she talking shit about me and the girl said no just forget about it.  So I said ok.  But after that I couldn't really look at her the same and I feel like there's something other people are saying about me that I'm not being privy to.  I think the girl was talking shit and she doesn't want to say anything for whatever reason.  I think she noticed I wasn't talking to her the same but I still helped her when she needed help and responded when she'd say something I just didn't really have much to say and honestly kept mulling over how they were talking about me inside my head.

130,"Howdy

As the title says I am looking for some advice on not letting my issue affect my girlfriends happiness. I get depression in chunks of time rather than continuously throughout my life. Recently I have been struggling really really badly with something that happened in the past with my girlfriend and I before we became a couple. If I was thinking rationally it is something that any normal person would feel weird about but would probably not bother them, but as most of you know, it's hard to look at things rationally in a lovely meaty depression state. So, recently I've been having conversations about it with her every other day, now I should mention she's about 4000km away from me and has been for the last month which sucks and makes communication even harder, as well as not having her with me affects my mental state. Im Rambling sorry

Anyway, I've basically been making her feel like shit and then apologise, felt a bit better, sleep, wake up+feel terrible, then rinse and repeat. Today for example I made us both cry, eventually I had a rant and felt okay, we soon cheered each other up and started joking a bit and then properly joking around like 'normal'. I feel like tomorrow theres a high chance ill be down again but I just want advice on how to keep her okay because although she messed up beforehand, she has been a faultless girlfriend to me. It saddens me to hurt her constantly. 

If you took the time to read my tired ramblings thank you, have a lovely day",04Jul2019,1

133,"Hello, I want to start by saying that in the past few months my mental health got worse than ever.  I feel miserable and like I can't handle this anymore, but I can't afford seeing a specialist. Besides all this,  what bothers me the most is that I can't stand my friends anymore. The two of them are the best friends anyone can even dream of, they helped me in any way, shape or form everytime I needed it the most, but now I feel like I don't want to see them for a while. It's just that I'm tired. I work 6 days a week and I got no energy left since I'm also mentally tired. I make the most stupid mistakes at work and I need to vent about them being so frequent, but the way my friends try to cheer me on is triggering me more because they always use the basic ""I don't think it's that bad"" when they just can't understand how big of a deal is making mistakes at work and how much it takes a toll on my confidence that doesn't even exist. They also aren't working because they're in college and stuff and now it's summer vacation so they have all the energy and excitement there is. One of them is really strong opinionated, just like me,and loves being outside all the time and we have to meet everyday even if its for a little time, but that for me is time I could use sleeping, taking a little break or getting better at my hobby that I want to pursue as a career in the future. I don't know why I have such negative feelings towards them to be honest, but I really don't care about them anymore I want to give up on everything and anyone. Even so, at the same time, I can't just tell them or ask them to give me a break because being there with them is the least I can do for them right now. I feel indebted for life because of how good and tolerant they are but at the same time I can't stand them for absolutely no reason and i can't wholeheartedly care about them anymore. I am totally aware that I am being the biggest asshole in existence and that's why I'm so concerned, I don't want to be like this. I don't make any sense and I don't know what's wrong with me.",04Jul2019,1

135,"(please alert me if this belongs in a different sub)

As far back as i can remember I've had a problem with compulsive behaviours; scratching, bone clicking, blinking even. Tensing muscles- especially in my throat and neck, pushing the undersides of my nails against things or pinching skin. Pretty much whatever the hell. To outsiders I think it appears as tourette's (I've been asked if i have it a few times before) but I'm fully aware that I control all of my behaviours, I just feel constant urges to do so. Since this is almost always an annoyance, looks odd, and often goes to the point of being painful without stopping (I.E my longest compulsion being a 4 month string of clicking bones in my neck which became extremely painful after only a month, yet was something I did maybe 5-10 times a minute)

&amp;#x200B;

As I've said, I don't feel I show any such signs of Tourette's, and anyone else's description of OCD doesn't seem to match my feeling, considering I don't have some great mental toll associated with it as I've heard others do. Being somewhat against self diagnosing I'd really rather not do that, but I also have no clue as to any avenues I may currently be able to take as to treatment. Thanks.",04Jul2019,1
136,"I will start off by saying I suffered from chronic depression, which progressively got worse from 15 years old up until now (I am 22). I came from a family who doesn’t believe that mental health is real, or an issue. That suicide was cowardly, and depression was just my generation’s way of not being able to deal with problems. I battled this alone.

My depression met its peak during University. I was never able to choose my own path in life, but was always forced to take the path my parents wanted me to take. Having already been struggling with depression, this was the beginning of it becoming even worse. During my past 3 1/2 years at University, I let my depression overcome me to a point where I f***ed up everything in my life because I seemingly didn’t care anymore. I was in such a dark place and there wasn’t a day that went by where I didn’t want to kill myself. I was crying every night, I was getting so angry with little things (with myself) that I would hit my forehead with my fists. I had just completely lost it. I had friends who would spill their problems to me, and whenever I tried to talk to them about depression they wouldn’t care. And then would talk behind my back, calling me crazy and suicidal. 

I then dealt with sexual assault 2 years ago. Following that, was a death of a friend—they had committed suicide. It was one thing after another. I ended up so lost with myself I dragged myself into debt, I didn’t want to work anymore, I stayed curled up in my room. I tried to talk to my family, only to get told that sexual assault towards women is « usually a lie ». I blamed myself for it for so long. And for someone already struggling with depression, this dragged me to rock bottom. I felt like I had nothing going for me in life. I hated my school, hated the people there, hated my family, hated my household. I felt like life had no meaning, I didn’t understand the point of living anymore. I hated every aspect of being alive. I had lost interest in everything. I had lost any passions I had. I tried everyday to pick myself back up but it was just emotions and anxiety flooding in every single time. I didn’t want to fix anything, and felt like the time was ticking until the day I kill myself. I stopped going to school, I was making irrational actions, I was calling myself a POS failure everyday. I was hitting myself, calling myself worthless.

Everything was seriously f***ed for a very long time. I felt like nothing will ever change for myself, and that I was meaningless.

Flash forward to this year, everything has changed so dramatically. I am in a place I would’ve never imagined myself to ever be in. September 2018, I decided it was time to fight this. It was time to regain myself, find myself, and beat the hell out of depression.

Currently, I’ve left my university. But I am now enrolled in online courses for animation, as well another program for software development. I found a passion for making clothing as well, and started going to craft shows &amp; opened up my very own online business. I’ve made new friends, and have much healthier friendships. I’ve traveled to new countries. I moved away from my family. I entered a committed relationship once I became healthier. My best friend &amp; I are moving to a new country together in a couple months. Everything feels better. I haven’t hit myself, I’m not angry anymore, I don’t cry anymore, I don’t blame myself anymore for what happened to me. I found my own independence away from my family. Everything changed so dramatically. But words cannot describe how hard it was. And I do get emotional when I think back to the very dark place I was in, and I know how many out there are struggling with it too. 

Theres a lot more to it, but I didn’t want to make this post horrifically long. But I wanted to share my story, and I want to reach out to anyone who is struggling that things can and will get better. Never stop fighting, never give-up. You are worthy, you have purpose. Depression will knock you down and even when things started to get better for myself, I still struggled with depression dragging me back down. I fought through it with everything I had. It’s hard but it is 100% possible. Don’t let anyone, especially yourself, convince you that you aren’t worthy of being happy. And don’t ever blame yourself for depression. It was hard ever trying to describe my depression when it first began, because it just existed in myself. 

And this is also a reminder, to pay attention to your mental health. Always. I still keep track of myself. But I refuse to let it take over me again. 

Sending hugs to all, I hope this can give anyone out there some hope.",04Jul2019,3

It took almost 6 months for him to get in with the first one and it took a med related breakdown to get it sped up even that much...he only saw this guy twice in the first year he was off work. He didn't jive with him... The Dr was too vague and unclear with things and my husband just got a wrong fit feeling. 

Our health insurance got him in with a different one and he saw him for the first time 6 weeks ago... today was the second appointment and because my husband used vulgar language he was asked to leave...there was no violence or threats or even anger...just poor choice in vocabulary. We don't know if he is allowed to rebook. They didn't say his file was closed but it was clear on the walls that they don't tolerate bad language. He said he was trying his best not to swear but it was unconscious because it is just the way he talks. 

Now we are back at square one... Living in a rural area with limited resources getting told that people can't help him. He was really hopeful with this Dr...the first appointment went well to him. The meds he was trying out were working slowly but surely. Now he just has even more reason to feel rejected and that the world would be better off if he died.

Throughout all of my depressive episodes when I feel like I’m worthless and everything around me is worthless, I never thought about killing myself. But during my episodes of anxiety I constantly feel like killing myself. I think it goes back to survival instincts albeit pretty bad ones. It’s the mentality of “I better kill myself now and spare a more painful death later because by the end of this I’m surely gonna die right?” except because it’s my anxiety talking, that intense response never matches the reality of the situation which isn’t that bad really.

And it’s not a normal passing thought. It really bothers me, I get a pit in my stomach, and I start playing the scenario in my head. The phone call, the feeling of dread, my siblings, how my life would change, the future. And it just lingers in my mind and I can’t focus.

Another would be like the idea of getting a heart attack. And suddenly I’m super aware of how my body feels, and I play the scenario in my head again and again, and I feel so scared of the possibility that I can’t focus on anything else.
