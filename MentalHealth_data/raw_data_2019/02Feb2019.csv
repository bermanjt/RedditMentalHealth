8,"Hey all!

&amp;#x200B;

So I've had an issue with social anxiety ever since my teens. Not sure what ""activated"" it but things just went downhill. 

Anyway... whenever I'm talking to anyone while I know for a fact others are looking at me (meeting, group discussion, or even talking to my s/o while someone else is there) my upper lip twitches a lot, and it becomes hard to talk. It's incredibly embarrassing, and it just makes the situation worse. I've done my best to relax during those times, but nothing stops it and I feel like I look rude covering my mouth or looking away. I've stopped talking mid-sentence during a meeting because of the fact I knew it was happening and I knew people were looking at me likely noticing it. 

It also frequently happens if I'm having a serious talk with a friend, or my s/o about something, or whenever I have to be confrontational for any reason. Generally, it happens if I know what I'm saying will take a while to say, and I know people are paying close attention to me/what I'm saying.

It's always transparent and it appears just inches from my face, sometimes it has eyes, other times nothing and it looks like a see through mask. There's also these glowing maggots that appear less often but it happens every now and then. At the blink of an eye the room im in will be filled with neon, bright, glowing maggots that float and move really fast.

11,"I have been on this drug (150) for a week now. I am going to 300 MG tomorrow.

I have had crippling depression since I was about 18/19 years old. I took lamitrogine but I got the rash so now I am on this. Lamitrogine didn’t have any noticeable side effects for me, although people around me said they noticed I was a bit better. 


Here is what’s going on this first week, wondering if I am alone on this.

I can’t sleep for shit. I have been on the schedule of up for 2 data, sleep 12-14 hours the next, repeat. I get crazy tired randomly and fall asleep for a short period of time then bounce back with lots of energy.  I want to clean and I am going back to the gym which is unreal for me, I’ve turned into a complete homebody the past couple years. 

Mentally, I am not sad. I forget to smoke which is nice. I do however get anger nightly for no real reason then it leaves. I also have great positivity which turns to great negativity within minutes, but overall I am not depressed. It’s very bizarre and makes me feel extremely unstable. 

I am way nicer to people. I usually dismiss people as peasants, but today I made small talk with my server which I never do. I then bought Halls for the lady at the grocery store who was bagging my food because I noticed she had a cold. I ask people how they are doing, when usually I couldn’t give any less of a fuck, and it’s involuntary.

I feel like I see and live little pieces of what it must be like to be normal, but I’m quickly pulled down to my old self and ways, and it bounces back and forth all day. Like constant tug of war for my mind. Yet through all these negative emotions, I no longer feel I am better off dead.

People occasionally tell me that I have deep, introspective facial characteristics; but constantly, I'm just living out fantasy scenarios or replaying and ruminating on social exchanges I've been a part of.

17,"Sorry for such a long post about probably something trivial, but it felt good. Also, this is my first post on this sub! So, hello!

I (22) have been secretly using and paying for online counseling for about eight months now but eventually it got to be such a financial burden I had to end my subscription. I have a long history battling depression and anxiety and I didn’t want to tell my parents I needed to talk to someone again (am currently living at home because I’m in school/ financial reasons). They’ve never been unsupportive, per se, but I’ve never felt like I could really open up to them or go to them when I needed help. Especially my father. 

However, today my dad was on me about my finances and looked through my transaction history (complicated scenario but will be changing after today). He kept bringing up the company name and I felt super uncomfortable. I had forgotten that I had switched cards so I didn’t even think about it. 

Later today, my mom came home and said she wanted to talk about the counseling service. I felt so ashamed. I was ready for anything. They’ve blamed me in the past or told me things are all in my head. But, instead, she assured me I can always tell them when I need help and suggested I use their insurance because she knows things are tough for me and wants me to keep getting the help I need. 

Hearing that was such a relief and I plan on calling to set that up as soon as I can. Anyways, I know this was a long post but getting support from them felt really relieving. She told me I don’t need to feel ashamed and she feels bad that I didn’t tell her I needed help. Just a few months ago, we were talking and she commended me on how well I was doing and how strong I seemed to be and all of that, so I felt especially embarrassed to bring it up. But, anyways, yes! Things weren’t always like this with them, but I’m hoping this means something more open with my parents. ",02Feb2019,1

Since 2013, I have been somewhat antisocial. I took a job that allowed me to work from home and when I had to communicate with my supervisor or manager, it was over email. The only time I have really talked to people was in the shop or local pub, and that was really only to say thank you. Since 2013, I have felt so confused...So fuzzy...Like my mind was constantly in a race with itself. I first self harmed around Feb of 2017.....Not to end my life, but to make myself feel something other than numb. I didnt cut often, perhaps every other month when my mind was close to exploding. Then, around November of last year (2018), I reconnected with a girl I knew in school. We immediately made a connection and soon we was dating....Unfortunately, she was only interested in the sex whereas I wanted what some would call an emotional relationship. One where sex was important, but so was everything else....Cuddling, talking, spending time with each other outside of the bedroom.....And it was around this time I started cutting almost every day. My mood was bouncing around so much. It would take the smallest thing to trigger a mood change and then eventually, it would lead to me holding my straight razor and bleeding. Then, around mid December, I started having panic attacks, mental breakdowns....I was punching walls, headbutting walls....I couldnt focus on anything.....I started drinking literally every night until I would pass out....my health slowly deteriorated......My girlfriend at the time, started taking my phone and causing arguments with any friend I had, just so I she had my full attention. I eventually lost everyone else....And then me and her broke up....In January 2019. I know what you are thinking....wow, you was together barely a month....But this was the first person I had a real connection with in years....I feel disconnected from my family....Its hard to explain but ask and I will.

Well, eventually, my now ex, convinced me to go to the doctors and talk to them. They gave me tablets for anxiety and depression but said they feel there may be more problems and that I should make an appointment with the Mental Health Practitioner...So I did....but once I had completed my tablets (they were for 2 weeks)....My mood dropped again, I was alone, and so I didnt go to my appointment....(I get extremely anxious when I go to the doctors, dentists or hospitals). Now, this leads us to now....Since then, I have had around 9 panic attacks, 3 mental breakdowns where iv completely destroyed my bedroom and I have self harmed countless times.....I have also been drunk every night since the 4th of January....Can anyone give me advice? Even just a word in the right direction? If you need more detail, please tell me and I will do what I can.....(Sorry this was so long, I just hope someone sees)",02Feb2019,1
19,Ever since I was little there’s been  something was wrong with me.  I can’t recall exactly when it started but I began to lash out at people I loved and cared about for the slightest reason. I was paranoid and afraid of them hurting me and betraying me just like my parents did. So I hurt them first. I hated doing this so I isolated myself to not hurt them anymore. When I wasn’t working or in school I’d lock myself in my room to prevent myself from lashing out. Growing up I had very few friends and acquaintances. A few months ago I became homeless and just recently my brother took me in. However I’m afraid that he’ll kick me out like everybody else I ever trusted did. I can’t show him my gratitude without lashing out. I’m sorry for hurting him. I’m really grateful but I’m afraid too. His wife is getting sick of me and I over heard her talking about kicking me out. I don’t want to go back into the cold. I want to get better and stop hurting people. I want to know what’s wrong with me and how can I stop being this way.

My girlfriend has been emotionally abused by her parents, especially her Mum who she has lived with alone since her parents were divorced when she was young, and it has been the main driving force in quite severe depression and anxiety. Since I met her a bit over a year ago she has come so far and i'm super proud, but there are still those days

&amp;#x200B;

She is 19 almost 20, and her Mum still controls her like she is a child, and is always super nasty to her. The worst part is that my girlfriend always feels guilty for feeling upset and makes excuses for her Mum all the time. She feels like she is just making it worse in her head and blaming her Mum, and says what her Mum does isn't that bad because people go through worse. To give some context, her Mum mocks her about being sad, makes fun of the way she looks, and questions ever choice she makes saying it is the wrong one.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this made any sense, but I suppose I just want any advice you can give me to help her when she feels down, and to not make her blame herself. Also, moving out isn't an option right now, but maybe in a month or so it could be an option.",02Feb2019,1

Its just fucked up that psychiatric care takes so long to get when no other care is like this.",02Feb2019,1
23,"My mom noticed my self loathing tendencies today and I didn’t realize that I was doing that. I’ve been depressed lately. And I’m working through trauma with my counselor lately.
My mom feels bad because she says my attitudes are like an abused child, and she really hopes she did her best in raising me. And she did. It wasn’t perfect parenting (everyone makes mistakes and no one is the perfect parent) but she gave me constant love and always did her best.
But I watched my dad nearly die when I was a child and I was bullied in school and an outcast and so I have (I think, my counselor legally cannot diagnose since she’s not a psychiatrist ) but I’m 90% sure that I have some mild PTSD from the trauma of the accident which my whole family went through and it’s difficult. It’s made me a bit obsessive too and I didn’t seek help for a very very long time so a lot of damage is done. I’m more open now and say “yeah I have mental health issues” and don’t downplay it any longer. 
And so it’s difficult for my mom and she seems to have all this guilt but it’s not her fault. We were dealt a tough deck of cards a lot of different things contributed to my mental health. Now I just have to get through it and hopefully heal myself with therapy. It’s a process.

I don't want to go to school or work or do anything anymore- I feel like it's pointless to keep trying to live and prepare for a future if the whole world is going to end in a decade or two.

27,"Tl;dr I don't know how to justify pretending I'm someone else in some other world (table top RPG's are my biggest hobby) when I have so much to do and learn about myself.

A little background: I have had depression for 5 years, at least. It has been masking an ADHD (I'm mostly sure, I have to get some psychological testing to see if it's correct). Looking back, I can see how everything about ADHD could have been taken from my own life. (Inattentive ADHD with Depression would be what fits the best in my mind.) I did pretty good in elementary and high school, but I do remember some things like teachers asking if I had siezures because I zoned out or getting hyper focused on things, and in general not being able to start things and getting distracted easily. I worry that maybe it's not ADHD because I don't remember a lot about school and I did pretty good with little effort. Although Adderall seems to help my focus and brain extremely well when I take it consistently throughout the day.  


I've been going to college off and on since high school, and I have seen the same thing. Also, I have had a heck of a time with the distractibility and lack of focus, and then overfocusing on one assignment and ignoring others. Things take forever for me to do them, as well. This semester I literally couldn't make myself do the reading, and so I ended up dropping all but one of my classes. The lack of motivation is the biggest thing that keys me in that it's ADHD.   


So basically it comes down to this. I have to figure out 1. If I have ADHD for sure, 2. How to overcome perfectionism 3. How to have a good self-esteem and not be co-dependent to/on/with? my wife, 3. Learn strategies to overcome the ADHD symptoms. (Low motivation, distractability, poor memory) and maybe find better meds; and 4. Generally rebuild my self-esteem, self-value, and automatic thought patterns so that I can be happy in the moment. (learn to be happy and do what makes me happy.)  


With all this on my plate, I feel guilty for finding distractions and escapes like D&amp;D and other TTRPG's. For some reason I don't feel guilt about wasting my time on Reddit or Facebook, though. It must be something about pretending to be some other ""character"" in some ""perfect"" world. Maybe it's me pretending to be able to manage my issues in that virtual world? I just can't justify that kind of pretending in the face of all of the real-world issues I have to face.   


I guess the big internal fight is because TTRPG's are my favorite hobby. I love playing them, DMing, hand-sculpting and painting miniatures, etc. I just don't want to lose myself in just pretending that this life isn't real? I'm not sure where this guilt is coming from.

29,"Hello everyone, I don't know where to put this, but when I was in therapy today, my grandfather passed. he had fallen a week back, when he was outside raking some leaves or something, no one knows how he fell, i was inside playing on my computer. he was found by some gardeners, they took him inside and we got an ambulance. I didn't know what to do with myself, all I could manage was to go up the street and tell his girlfriend of three years. the next day he moved to rehab, after getting x-rayed. I used to live with him, he's the only family member in the city where I go to uni. I can't stand going back home, the old and empty house is too much to bare. I've been sleeping in hospital waiting rooms. Today they were sorting through his permanent care papers and found a paper he signed three years ago, that essentially says he doesn't want to be held on life support. When we would wake up, he would call for my cousin that used to live with him, and ask him how he could get out, and leave. I'd try and tell him the only way to get was to exercise do as the doctors and nurses say, eventually hed be well enough to walk again and go home. That was a lie and I knew it, but I didnt want to admit it, and he knew it to. He eventually did get out of that place, just not the way either of us wanted to. Looking back on the whole thing I cant feel much less than ashamed of myself. all 19 years of my life I had this man to enjoy, make memories with, and take after. All I could manage was to sit there silently and what him die for three days. It makes me feel worse when I realize I had built my current life leeching off of him. Depending on him to pay the bills, take care off the chores while I stayed inside pretending to study, or playing a game, never really appreciating him. Of course I have gratitude for everything that he did for me, he gave me a place to live, while I was studying, I person to be there when my mental health started to take a downturn and I was hallucinating, he payed for my food, and gave my an opportunity to go to the college I had wanted to since I was a child. I wish I had longer to thank him, for everything pay him back, keep him alive, make maybe a memory that isn't dependent upon him leaving this world. yet for all of that I have little to show for. Now I have to move back to the UK, I can't pay my bills, Keep going to college, and take care of his dog, and keep my part time job, all at once. IF THERE IS ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR, I AM NOT ASKING FOR MONEY, im asking that for everyone who has an elderly one, or someone competing with life and death, spend time with them, because no one has everyone the race. It all happens so quickly, you tell yourself They're going to go sometime, just not soon. I thought the same thing a week ago, here I am a week later, no memories, no support system, no grandfather. spend time with them, get your nose off of the computer, and go do something with them take a walk, go out to eat, something, no matter how busy you want to tell yourself you are, no matter how boring or unexciting they are. you find something inside of them that's worth hanging onto. If you dont do it today or tomorrow, when theyre gone, you'll find yourself with a lot of time for them, and searching for something to hang on to.

But I don't think it's possible for me to be happy or to be that vision because I don't change to make it happen. Today I don't know why but i just feel like utter shit. I went to school and in my math class the girl infront of me hit me in the head with her arm when she sat down at her desk and i was trying to lay my head down. She said sorry but in a way where i knew she didnt care. It's shit like that that gets me off because i always let shit happen to me and i never speak up about and i am so done with just being me in general. I'm never not nervous being alone or doing things alone, Im on edge and I'm thinking in my head hoping that nothing embarrassing happens cause i will overthink it and let it get to me so much that i start to add to things i hate about myself. After that some girl that has a problem with me for no reason was whispering that she didnt like me to her friend and when i was leaving from the locker i was at she said that she knows i heard her. I've tired hard to just not let other people bother me but truth is people are what i am most afraid of. That guy who threw a piece of paper at me when i sat alone in the bleachers at gym made me realize that I'm never gonna be that person that i want to be. Why?

I CAN'T EVEN LOOK PEOPLE IN THE EYE ANYMORE I AM SUCH A FUCKING COWARD AND SO INSECURE THAT I CAN'T PUSH MY SELF TO LOOK AT ANOTHER HUMAN WITHOUT FEELING THEIR EYES JUDGE ME AND MAKE ME FEEL LIKE SHIT. 
DOES ANYONE GET WHAT I'M FEELING? IS THERE A WAY TO FIX THIS FUCKED UP UNMOTIVATED INSECURE MINDSET I HAVE? im gonna breakdown later but im leaving this here because i couldn't vent to my friend. Have a nice night thanks for reading

31,"I've been feeling really overwhelmed recently and I've been reading up on mental disorders and I didn't even know most of them existed or what they were.

Is there somewhere I can go (UK) to get checked for these things or do I need to know what I'm asking for? I'm convinced there is something wrong with me but I don't know what or how to go about checking.",02Feb2019,1
32,"I see this a lot, especially on twitter. And the intention is really nice so I get it and it's completely understandable. But on the other hand, it keeps reminding me that I guess I was just a fucked up kid who couldn't live a normal life like most people. 

I could just forget it and move on and I do, but when it appears on my feed again, it not only reminds me that I was a fucked up kid, it also reminds me how people tend to constantly dismiss those who are really suffering from mental health issues or chronic disorders and illnesses because what they're experiencing isn't enough to be taken seriously by the grown ups. Which really doesn't help at all.

When quarterlife crisis was just introduced to us at a lecture, I found that it fit me and my friend even told me about it to explain my situation, although not entirely and not exactly. Because the funny thing is, I just turned 18, I hadn't graduated college yet at the time and it's been there even before I entered college so no, I wasn't in the ""real world"" yet and I wasn't stuck in a job I hate. But for most, real struggle only begins when you're ""out there"". None of what I had to deal with was worth looking into, even if it meant I wanted to end my life countless times. I was just a kid, what do I know, right? I saw how my younger cousin was also dealing with similar issues and was crumbling down, but his family and our other relatives just mocked him and dismissed what he was going through, so he would just shut up and didn't do anything. This, is the norm though.

I'm just saying, it would've been nice to hear that sort of support and our struggles to be acknowledged and heard and not just be brushed off. I'm in the ""real world"" now and those internal struggles they talk about that you only get once you're in it? are all too familiar. Idk",02Feb2019,1

37,"So ive been very depressed and unproductive the past year or so, and i feel like my depression was making me stay in bed until 1 or if i had an appt or work, (i usually worked nights). but i was trying to overcome it, i would never eat or do anything good for myself. if i had work i would lay in bed for as long as a could because everything was just too much. 

then i enrolled for 2 classes at my local community college. an 8am fitness class 2x a week and an 11am art class 2x a week also. 

anyways, they started this week and ive been doing good getting up and going. while today was friday it was my day off from school and work, normally id stay in bed all day, but today i got up, took a shower, went grocery shopping and made an early dinner for my family and boyfriend. 

the point is, when people say getting in a routine will help you get productive, its true. and i recommend doing it.

for one having a job is a good distraction, without my job idk what id do, u HAVE to go and get out of bed and can focus on something else other than ur thoughts. great way to make friends or have normal social interaction 

schools harder, i havent been in a year due to my problems so taking the step to enroll was big for me and im glad the first week went good. i wouldve never got up put of bed and done something with my life if i wasnt already use to it

Basically, I was getting so worked up by the thinking of the topic at hand in itself that I suddenly became blind to the outside world and was one minded on building and completing the concept in my head, and my typing started to become less of an explanation and more of a vague narration of what was going on in my head.

1. Im 22/m and i have never been in a relationship, never had sex or kissed anyone. No matter how i try, there is something like an invisble barrier that makes it impossible for me to get intimate with a girl on any level. Im afraid of sex. Otherwise im socially active, most people like me and i like most people. I have plenty of friends and i have no problem with any social skill.
2. I am fat. Like obese. I used to be a regular kid with normal body, no eating problems, i was on the streets all the time playing with friends, running around all day. Than when i was about 7-8, i strated to eat a lot, gained a lot of weight. I was (and still am) obsessed whith food. I went to therapy, but everyone came to the same conclusion. It is a protective behaviour, some kind of mental protection, but noone had a clue why. 
3. I sometimes fantasize about penises. I am not gay in any ways. I wouldnt mind if i were, but im not, cause im not attracted to men at all.
4. I sometimes like to hurt myself for sexual pleasure. Other times it disgusts me. It usually happens when i feel low.

I am not angry. Im just disgusted and hurt. I want to leave it all behind, with all the shit it brought to my life. 

I live with my father and we run a business together. Again, im not angry, just want to leave it all behind.

42,"(F,18) I haven't been diagnosed with any mental illness, though my family does have a history of certain mental illnesses and I have suspected that I have an anxiety disorder since I was about 11 and had my first (of many) panic attacks and depression since I was 14 and suicidal. I have been able to deal with these issues until about a year ago. I stopped being able to sleep (unable to fall asleep until I've been awake for so long I pass out) and it's ruining my life. I have constant headaches, memory loss, and feel terrible and exhausted all the time. 

My mom said in passing that she thinks I might be depressed and I think that might be true. I feel empty all the time, started failing my classes, and have no motivation to do anything. The thing is I'm a senior in high school, live at home, and don't currently have a valid license. There is no way for me to go to the doctor or therapist on my own. My mom suggested taking me a few times but she never followed through. I tried to bring it up once but she said they would just tell me to exercise more. I told her telling my aunt on the phone that she doesn't want them to give me medications I don't need. She knows bad my lack of sleep is getting and has seen me have panic attacks (which have become more frequent in the past year.)

I feel like my health, mental and physical, is deteriorating and I don't know what to do at this point. I'm too embarrassed to ask her to take me to the doctor and I don't want to be a burden.

47,"So for the past few weeks I’ve been dealing with sleep anxiety. I used to go to bed early, like fall asleep at 8pm and wake up at 9am the next morning. Now I can’t fall asleep until 3 am on a good night. 

Usually when it hits about the 2:45am mark I take a sleeping pill (zzzquil) if I don’t feel tired. Tonight I didn’t take anything despite the fact that my mind was racing and I was jumping from thought to thought.  I worked late (until 1am) today and had an anxious night. (I have depression and anxiety comes sometimes too). The stress of the job made negative thoughts come into my mind. Those thoughts chased each other around in circles until I saw my boyfriend. Then I was very happy and energetic. 

When he fell asleep (around 3:15am) I started trying all the tools I know to help fall asleep. But I couldn’t stay focused on any of them long enough for them to actually work. My mind just keeps racing. I feel jittery. 

It’s now 6:30am I just took a shower because I heard that could help you fall asleep sometimes and I started getting bad anxiety because I couldn’t fall asleep and usually showers make me feel better. 

My plan now is to lay down until I fall asleep or until it’s 7am, because then the CVS down the street opens and they sell melatonin. I need to sleep because I have work in a few hours until late again. 

I just feel very anxious and my stomach is starting to hurt. I also feel like I wanna cry out of frustration.

You think as hard as you can at your hand to move, to twitch, anything. But nothing gets through because you don't move your hand by thinking verbally at it. 

When you succeed at moving your hand it will come by accident, and once you can do it again it is so instinctual that you couldn't explain the steps that go into it. You just move your hand to where you want it to be. No verbal comands or breaking a huge task into steps, it just happens.

I'm under huge amounts of stress right now and the level oh helplessness if feel when I try to sit down to my desk and work is the same complete shutdown of communication that I feel when I forget how to move.

My mom introduced me to my step-dad when I was around 5 I think, and honestly it was the worst day of my life. Even at that age I knew something was off about him but I just didn’t know what, until it started happening. When he would pick me up on Tuesdays from school we’d come home and he’d go to bed, often asking me to join him, and from there it got a lot worse. He would touch me in my groin area and ask me to give him oral sex. He’d refer to this as “tickling” so that if I ever brought it up when my mom was around, she wouldn’t know. This went on to the age of 12, and by then I knew it was so so wrong. I remember one instance I was 10 or so, and I was begging for an iPod since every other kid at my school had one and he told me one night when my mom was in bed, and I was laying down in my own bed that if I let him do this to me for one more night he’d get me one, and that was the night he raped me. 

I’m honestly feeling sick to my stomach writing about this so I’ll just skip to the mental health part. I’ve been so messed up since then, I’ve been in an abusive relationship and I thought it was okay because it was better than what my step-dad had done to me. I’ve buried everything so deeply and it’s repressed. I can’t even talk to a therapist about this because they’re legally required to contact the police and I’ve already tried to tell them but they didn’t believe me and I was in the system for half a year only to be put right back at home with no hope of anything. I’m 18 now, and I’m still at home. 

I recently discovered through a fight my mom and I had that she actually believed me, but the cops, my step-dads mom and sister all told her it couldn’t have happened. I feel so lost, I feel like garbage and even still my mom says some things that really hurt. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve thought about suicide so many times because I feel fucking worthless because of what he did. I’m trapped in a hell hole where I have to live with my abuser and I have to pretend that everything is okay and I just can’t anymore. My mental health is declining and I just feel so lost, I just need to reach out to somebody... Anybody. I feel like I’m just drowning in all of this. There isn’t a day I don’t think about what happened to me and I can’t take it anymore.",02Feb2019,1

In their places I've been reading, writing, exercising, listening to more podcasts. I feel almost worn out and bored out of my mind 24/7. Reading through 12 Rules for life helps but I find reading boring in general.

My issue is I know I'm on a better path, but it feels so tiring and bleak. I've continued to try to go out with women, I've thought of many things to do like paintballing and rock climbing just to get that surge of dopamine going. Anything I can think of is to far or too expensive for I've been an idiot for the past two years, and haven't accomplished much which further inhibits me. Now my concentration seems to slip away faster, I'm feeling more numb. I'd assume it's because I'm on a dopamine crash is my best estimation. Is there anything I can do to ride this out?

69,"So, the place I saw was NHS funded and diagnosed me with BPD after just two visits, which I don't think is appropriate now I look back. I saw a psychiatric nurse once every two weeks and she just rushed and seemed annoyed when I took up the whole hour of the session and tried to rush me out as soon as possible. I left in what I thought was a good place mentally, but I was weirdly happy thought I was the best thing in the world and have done some risky shit (such as sending nudes while I was at work... No one saw but I'm lucky I'm not fired and that is not like me at all because they even had my face in there).

So the nurses plan was I enroll myself in talk therapy and wait the year long waiting list, but now I seem to have slipped into being depressed again. And I did get a job, I've looked into private therapy but that is ridiculously expensive and I'm on minimum wage and am trying REALLY hard not to spend all of my money in one go. They suggested I take antidepressants before I left, but the last time I went manic, hallucinated and then crashed and had another suicide attempt. They said that can happen, but to be honest I think I need to be on mood stabilisers. Of course I want a proper diagnosis for this as I don't want to diagnose myself. 

But I've been discharged from that place now, so I don't know if it's worth sending her another letter explaining this because I don't think I should go onto a medication from a rushed diagnosis. I'll post the draft in the comments, I guess I'm just venting and want to know if it's worth sending the draft.

&gt;Mods, I've read your rules and this post doesn't seem to be breaking them. If I am, however, can you at least tell me what parts I need to remove in order to try and receive help with my issue? Thanks in advance.

I guess to preface this post, the important fact is that I've been going through manic episodes of depression and anxiety since my Grandmother died due to complications brought on by Parkinsons disease. I was her full time care giver up until we had to transfer her to long-term care. She was my light, essentially a third parent to me. I understand and am ready for being told that this is an over reaction to an over reaction. 

This was my father's mother, whom he had a very strenuous relationship, if that context is needed.

Since September I've been a dang wreck, but it's gotten very bad since the new year. I've had motivational struggles since being a kid in school but nothing like this before. I'm told that this is normal for grief, and I get it, but that hasn't stopped any of the hurt that comes along with the loss of a woman who was practically a third parent for me.

My dad, throughout childhood, was a stand out guy, a single parent dad doing all that he could to make sure his only child of a son could make it on his own. This all changed right about the time I was finishing up high school, he just started dating seriously again and he had met this other woman who seemed nice. We'll call her Sheryl. Dad went from being a family-driven man to a woman-driven man. His relationship with Sheryl lasted about 7 strong years and one final year of trying to mop up what was left, but eventually this past September Sheryl left him within days of losing his mother. Because of their troubled past I can't tell if he's more upset at his mother dying, or at how torn up his son is about it, or if he's only upset things didn't work out with Sheryl. We haven't talked about her death other than when we needed to finish estate paperwork, **and plans for a vacation after her death, that we will talk about soon.**


And two nights ago was the first time as an adult that I've had the chance to reflect on his character. And it's not a  good look. 

Let's meet my dad's new girlfriend Courtney. Courtney is a sweet woman who sees my dad's struggles coming out of a toxic relationship with Sheryl. She sees the dad I saw years ago. She wants everything for my dad, and I like this about Courtney. She's attached to dad and I as if we were her own family, and she recognizes our pain, and wants to fix it. She, however, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in October. Her first surgery and rounds of chemo started in mid-December, so to make up for these first two months of nice sentiment on Courtney's behalf, dad cancels all of his plans and **takes her to Hawaii, cancelling our vacation plans.** I get that cancer trumps mental illness, but I can't help but feel a little shafted from this. 

My dad's solution of getting me out of my anxiety slump is for me to get a job because the medial work will help me ""take my mind off of things."" And while I would love some income and a chance to get out of the house, and would love to talk to people again and be social, and get some sunshine. The best parts I remember about being employed were feeling welcomed by a few good Co workers and leaving the day feeling like I did something.

I had a mental break down dragging my feet through the online application processes we all know and love. I've been unemployed a couple of times throughout my life because of behavioral issues of my own, or because I've lacked the motivation or desire to stay at an entry level job being taken advantage of for too long. But the problem for me has never been getting the job, it's been trying to keep my mind at ease so I felt complacent enough to keep it. I've been explaining this paragraph to him for several years, but it's not in his nature to listen, because he thinks it's rebellion.

My dad's newest ""Job opportunity that can really turn your life around?"" Filling up air at the jiffy-lube. He thinks I really have a chance at getting the job there because ""the manager and I talked about our Jeeps for five minutes while he rung me up for new tires.""

Two nights ago is when the point of this post really takes place. Courtney catches wind of this opportunity, however not under the impression of what the job is or why my dad thinks this will be great, but matches his enthusiasm about it whole heartedly. This causes me to snap, thinking that she's been sent my way like any good cop-bad cop scenario, and I tell her the same motivation spiel I gave a few paragraphs ago, albeit in a more panicked tone. As one having an episode of anxiety does. Meanwhile I need to call my biological mother to cry my eyes out for a little while. But Courtney was off crying too in that time. And I hope to God the only reason she cried was because of how hurt I am, but what came next I wasn't ready for.

A phonecall from dad.

An angry phone call from dad.

Picking up the phone while under emotional and mental turmoil is never a good idea in my opinion. But maybe I just don't like phone calls. But I'm immedietly greated to a raised tone as if a child had just got caught doing something horrible. My dad yelling at me, reminding me that people are only trying to help, and that if I cared about healing that I would've called a councellor back when he provided me with the phone numbers of some on his County-provided insurance.

He's angry. Angry for one of three reasons. Either his son is mentally challenged, mentally ill, or otherwise just struggling, but he's angry that I am one of those, not worried. Angry that I couldn't apply for a job he really wanted me to work towards and make a career out of (because everyone starts off filling tires at the jiffy lube.) Angry because his son was too terrified to overshare his problems while making a few cold calls to some doctors offices.

My bio-mom called and scheduled for a mental health evaluation, which happens for me on Tuesday. But I can't shake this feeling in ~~the back of~~ everywhere in my mind. I don't know if it's anger, disappointment, I just don't know how to feel other than a parent has turned their back on me.

My dad has since apologized over text but now that he's home again he's just trying to move on and pretend like nothing happened. I'm stuck hiding in my room making sure that he doesn't see my pain, lest I trigger his anger again, or he shares his expirience with Courtney and my pain makes her cry again. He told me it was an over reaction on his part. 


But the only question I have for him is whether or not he yelled at me to try and help me, or to try and help Courtney.

And my question that I need advice for, is how to handle my dad going forward. Is this toxitity something that should warrent a zero-tolerance rule? Should I forgive him because he's my father and probably just struggling like me? Both of our pain is valid, and after having someone as close as a father tell me that my pain isn't valid and that it's only happening in my head, I've turned into a person who wouldn't declare that to anyone. That shit hurts. I shouldn't keep that kind of behavior around.

Or. Should I? Am I just panicking? Am I just going through the worst point of my life and this giant avalanche was just started by wanting the dad who cancels everything he's doing and spends time with his son?",02Feb2019,1

75,"Do you ever sit and wonder about what people really think of you? Maybe you wonder if, when you leave, everybody talks about you behind your back? Maybe you’re some kind of freak or an inherent loser that people only pretend to like?

Well, step right up because you just described the first 3 weeks of my mental rehabilitation! And ho-lee shit, I *definitely* transformed some things but **oh boy** am I crazy! 

First and foremost, I have some other posts here that outline how this progress has been moving, but to summarize it:

**WEEK 1**: Epiphany that I am my *own* problem, that I catastrophise my situation (having multiple diagnoses) so much that I don’t let myself enjoy life despite it. This means prescribing to my own depression: telling myself that *this is how life is, this are the dice that were rolled for me so, fuck it*. Btw, this is WRONG. So, so, so so so so wrong. I spent YEARS, like TWO DECADES, essentially telling myself that I would always be pathetic. That’s what it came down to: *I’m not strong enough, I’m not good enough, I’m destined for shit*. So guess what I gave to myself? **Shit**, people, the answer is *shit*. 

**WEEK 2**: The *I really want to change but oh my god I’m a horrible person and have wasted my whole life and now I’m doomed* phase. 
This was a hard one. This is where I pretty much tried convincing myself that knowing how much of a douchebag I’ve been is nothing compared to the (probably) years it would take to rehabilitate from that. So 🤯 I’m doomed forever! No, not so much. This was admittedly difficult because all of the shitty things I’d been doing, including the ways I treated people because my mental health seemed like an excuse for it, became really uncomfortably clear. 

This means: realizing what I did to push my family members away, out myself in situations that caused major hurt and suffering, refusing to acknowledge I had a problem and choosing to let it grow instead, the awful things I have done as a partner in relationships, what a weird and shitty friend I was, how hard it was to get along with me as a coworker HOLY SHIT GUYS. I spent a FULL WEEK berating myself because I had just figured out that the problem was ME. Ouch. Gross. Awkward...

Well, **WEEK 3**: the *Will I ever process this** phase. Week 2 was a lot to handle. I’m sorry to say that I was pretty much a shut-in and I was constantly trying to dodge people so they wouldn’t see me in this really vulnerable state. It was hard to navigate through what I could do as a person to improve and what I needed to do to make amends for the things I was doing wrong — what was in my scope of control and what I would need to rely on medication for. It was definitely a mind-fuck. 

Then it hit me, those two magical words said with the right intention: fuck it. 

And it was amazing! **On the 28th day the clouds parted, and I said “FUCK IT”!** 

It doesn’t matter what happened. Right now matters. It matters that right now I’m doing the same thing I’ve always done.  It matters that I won’t put this down, even though it’s been 3 weeks of constant thinking, and I still subconsciously feel like I owe it to the universe to be unhappy or be the type of person who never will be happy. Fuck this. Fuck all that. **Fuck it.**

And since then I’ve been really happy.

**WEEK 4:** the *I don’t think I’ll be an uptight asshole anymore* phase. I really missed the fun part of life and who I am when I’m embracing it. So, no more blowing off friends. No more finding reasons to say no to things. No more convincing myself before it starts that I’ll break if I let my hair down. I’m starting to do things I enjoy again just because I like it: fuck whoever has a problem with what I like doing. That’s they’re problem and not mine.

I’m going back to college to be a counselor. Yeah, a lot of messed up stuff did happen to me. I messed up a lot to. I’m not putting that to no use: maybe it happened for a reason and I’m supposed to do something with all the wisdom I gained from it. I want to help people who are like me so, Masters Degree here I come. I’m going to do it, I don’t care who says no — I won’t let that person be me.

I’m going to start taking care of my body again. I love my body and it loves me, when I let it. I’m going to start treating it better so I can enjoy life longer. I want to be proud of what I have anyway — what’s wrong with that? 

Last, I’m being a better person. I’m going to start volunteering again, form better relationships, form better habits, get rid of what’s toxic and appreciate the rest.

I already knew what I needed to do, I just needed to find the balls to believe I could do it. 

It took me FOUR weeks: one month, out of probably 2 full decades of self destructive and toxic, depressive behaviors. Take this stuff seriously. Take YOURSELF seriously. If a big dummy like me can do it, I know you can. If you want a little inspiration, PM me because this is going to be my last update. 

Just ask yourself: is it seriously a crime to love who you are? Will it honestly hurt to believe that you’re actually a normal person who’s just working through some hard things and you need a little love? Maybe your situation is different than mine; in fact, it probably is. I still love you anyway. The trick is in whether or not *you* still love you anyway.

76,"I hope this is the right subreddit for this. This will probably be a somewhat long, incoherent rant about my worries about my mental health.

I'm 18, live in Germany and was diagnosed with Aspergers about a year ago. I've been to a psychologist twice now. The first time was mainly because of bullying AFAIK, and the second time was after my teachers told my parents that they thought I had a problem and that I should get that checked out. The second time was when I got diagnosed with Aspergers after they thought I had social anxiety. Both times they quickly dismissed the thought that I might be depressed.

Recently my grades have gotten even worse in school to the point where I might just fail everything, and my reaction to that was that I wanted to commit suicide. Some teachers told my that they think that I should get therapy or something. I'm worried that I might have depression, and I feel like I can't talk to my parents about it. I've told a ""friend"" about my suicidal thoughts and he just told that he thinks that I wouldn't go through with it, and that he would mainly be worried that I'd try to shoot up our school and kill him. I don't trust him anymore.

This is my last year in school if I don't fail, and I don't know how I'm supposed to live after that. I barely learn anything for school, and studying at a university would probably be worse than it is now. I don't think I'll ever manage to find a job without help, and my parents don't want to have to help me AFAIK.

Like I already said, I don't know what to do now. I'm worried that I'm depressed and should get therapy, but I don't know *how*. I know that I can't get diagnosed over the internet, I just hope that I can get some advice on what to do.

I have a big problem. When someone texts me and doesent use emojis I always think that the person is mad at me or something.

It´s getting a bigger problem as time goes by because I always ask if someone is mad or sad. Sometimes I even react ike they are mad, when they dont use emojis. I know this sounds like a joke but it´s really serious. As example there is a girl which is very close to me. Wehad some issues in the past but it´s fine now. She doesen´t use any emojis most of the time and I always think of her tlaking in a monotone or even angry or pissed off way. This happens almost everytime I read text with out emojis.(It´s just very serious in her case)

Looking back at HS and college (and even before), almost anyone that talked to me was mocking me behind my back. Sometimes I would be invited to parties, social gatherings, etc. and everyone would be openly mocking me without me realizing it. At my age, I rarely get invited anywhere and when I try to reach out, people are usually brief or don't respond to my messages. When I do get invited somewhere, I'm pretty sure it's out of pity.

I have (and have always had) terrible social skills, especially in large groups. I'm loud, obnoxious, annoying, and don't know when to stop. I've always had moments in my life where I put myself above others to make myself feel important (and because of my huge insecurity) by putting others down. I cringe at past interactions I had with others where I tried to be cool - I would try so hard. Now I realize that those people were mocking me and laughing behind my back as I was being super cool.  

Since college, I've had a decently successful career. Although I feel I do pretty well in my line of work, social gatherings (including Monday lunch where we talk about our weekends and I always have nothing to offer) are awful.

88,"Let me elaborate, because this has been getting worse recently and I'm becoming more and more curious as to what it is exactly. I can only think it might be a symptom of a panic attack, but I can't tell at all (I'm also not prone to panic attacks).

I have a rather debilatating aversion to conflict. As in, classic freeze-up, I can't think and don't know what to do in the slightest. Fortunately, I'm quite a capable interpersonal diplomat, so the vast majority of the time this doesn't occur, but lately I have found myself in a number of unavoidable and inescapable personal conflicts that quite literally make me feel as though the room I am in has expanded in size. I'm absolutely concious at the time that nothing at all has *really* happened to the room itself - I at least have that much control over my perceptions - but the worse my stress becomes in a conflict, the worse the very vivid, illusory sense of the room expanding in size becomes. *Why* that strikes my brain as such a problem isn't entirely clear (apart from the obvious 'reality isn't behaving itself' dilemma), but I guess the sensible reasons would be a) the literal distance between myself and who I am in conflict with increases (which is a bad thing, as ideally you'd want the 'gap' to close, in a reconcilliatory manner, right?) and b) if I wanted to run away, I'd be running forever and still wouldn't reach the door, which is scary. I'm not one for panic attacks, and I feel as though my grip on reality is pretty solid for the most part, so this recent phenomenon has me a bit stumped.

I've a long history of hallucinations (exclusively as a result of high fevers - I get bloody hot, man) as it happens, and the feeling accompanying these strange experiences actually resembles the feeling of dread that comes with said hallucinations, but I really don't think it's a hallucination that's coming up - there's just sensory/emotional similarities and I thought it was worth mentioning.

Any ideas anyone? It really bends my head and I hate feeling like my grip on my immediate reality is distorting due to stress, especially when I'm trying to focus on resolving the conflict at hand; it completely throws me off, not to mention it makes me feel like I'm losing my mind a bit.

89,"I have Asperger's and severe anxiety, and I just want to vent.

&amp;#x200B;

My day starts off with going to school. My first period is Television Production. Sounds fun, except for the fact that 75 percent of people are in that class for a free period and are basically entitled (insert slang that also means female dog). It seems like half of them enjoy my pain. (Once actually got sent to the counselor for threatening to stab myself since it seemed to please them, but that's another story.) That goes on for about an hour. I then go to my next 2 classes. My 4th class (theater) is my second troubling classroom. My best friend is in that class, but so are about 5-10 other people who hate my guts. This is a large class with 30-ish people in it. I actually enjoy drama. The problem is that I've been stuck in a group with a good friend, a neutral party, and 3 people who think they know everything about drama. I don't want to toot my own horn, but I feel like I'm pretty good at acting. But these girls want everything their way. I have been antagonized by them for doing things that THEY would do. I wanted to change a scene since the way they wanted to do it made no sense, but then I was actually threatened by the NEUTRAL PARTY that they would punch my face. The next scene we did, they wanted to genderbend the whole scene to make it ""funnier"". Thankfully, we ended up not doing that, but they really wanted to. There are also a few other people that hate me that include the future drag queen and the girl who hates me for no reason and doesn't even want to be in close proximity with me (she once even apologized to her group for not acting so well since I was near). I then go to lunch. I eat lunch in the front office since it stinks (to me at least) in the cafeteria, and I have sensory issues with fruits and vegetables (it's not being picky, I will vomit if I even just see a squashed grape). I then go to my next class, which is ELA. I personally hate ELA (not the teacher, she is very nice and understanding). Most adults have an average reading level of 7th grade. I'm already above that. Also, in the general career path I want to take, it would benefit way more to learn the language of Python than the language of English. When that ends, I go to physical science. Now, I love science. But I hate the teacher and class. I can literally skip this period for a week straight and still pass tests with flying colors. That class feels like an eternity. After that ends, I finally go to last period AKA the only period I actually like: engineering. Most of my friends are in this class, the teacher is amazing, and I love the subject. This is usually the best part of my day. I sometimes have extracurriculars. The one extracurricular that I like is a program called FPS. The other one is piano. I used to like doing piano when I started, but then the hype wore off and I got a new teacher. The teacher is a good teacher, but her teaching style is more like training to become the next Mozart. She's actually quite young, but she gets mad when I don't do the correct fingering or don't lift my hands after each measure. I mean, I understand that's the ""proper"" way to do it, but doing a different fingering or not lifting your fingers after each measure gives literally the same results, if not better. I told my mom I didn't want to take piano after faking a stomachache to get out of it, and she asked if I could just do a few more classes since she already payed for them. I did the few classes, but it turns out she payed for more classes. After school and the extracurriculars, I use my phone to talk to my friends and to play games. I also use the computer to learn more about things I like, whether it's trying to cram as much stuff into a 7 day free trial to tinkering with online neural networks. Then cue my mom, who doesn't understand anything about mental health, even though she thinks she does. She believes to cure my anxiety, I just have to try hard enough, that I have panic attacks just to get out of doing chores, and that I can control my anxiety at will. She also hates my phone with all her might. The thing is, my phone is usually my only coping device. I know it seems lame, but I have tried about everything. I've tried drawing, listening to music, meditating, doing deep breathing, everything. It just doesn't work. My mom thinks that I'm addicted and that the phone is controlling my life. She just can't grasp the concept that the reason I'm on my phone all day is because I want to forking die all the time, and I don't want to feel like that. She also seems to like comparing herself with me, sating how she also is stressed and depressed and how she wants to give up but she isn't and if she can keep going, so can I. I get that you also have a hard life and I know I'm not making thing any easier, but it honestly doesn't seem fair comparing yourself to me when I actually have to take medication to prevent you from succumbing to anxiety and going crazy. The worst part is when I start to feel anxious, she gets MAD at me. I mean like, okay I want to stab myself with a screwdriver in the eye and I need to let all this emotion out, but hey, since you're making myself want to die even more, I guess I'll stop. She likes to use the term ""terrorizing the house"" whenever I have an anxiety attack, even though she only usually makes it worse when I have one. She also doesn't understand that she is a major contributor to my anxiety. Basically what she does is like adding gasoline to put out the fire, but then gets mad at the fire for not going out. The worst part is that when I feel negative emotions (anxious/angry/depressed/sad), I get destructive thoughts. Not like ""rip a paper and then we're done"" destructive, but wanting to literally break down the whole house with a sledgehammer or repeatedly hit someone with a golf club. I know that I shouldn't think these thoughts and I know all the consequences of doing those actions and that I know I would never have a clear conscious if I hurt anybody.  I control these feelings very well, but I'm scared one day I might just lose it. Another problem is when I go to sleep. My mom wants me to go to sleep at 22:00, but I haven't gone to sleep at that time for over a year. I usually go to sleep at 23:00, which still gets me 9 hours of sleep. But yeah, my neurologist told me that I should go to sleep at 22:00. This would be fine if my mom actually understood what my neurologist meant. She meant try to transition from 23:00 to 22:00 over the span of 3 weeks. My mom took this as I should be in bed by 22:00, and just lie awake for 1-2 hours doing nothing but trying to go to sleep. I usually go to sleep anxious or sad, and then I wake up again, the whole process starting over again.",02Feb2019,1
90,"Hi so I’ve literally never told ANYONE this before but I’m 14 and for years now I’ve been hearing whispering voices in my head. When I was younger (like 7-11 years old) they were almost every day but then they stopped for like 2 years and when I was around 13 they came back again and I’ve had them ever since. I hear them mainly when its quiet-ish but not always and they sound like a huge room of loads of people just whispering quite loudly but I can’t make out what any one person is saying and I never have been able to but they are kinda aggressive and they sound like their mocking me or trying to scare me almost even though I don’t know what they’re saying. That probably makes no sense because It’s hard to explain which is mainly why I’ve never told anyone. I have no idea whether it’s something to worry about or not because they never tell me to harm myself or others or anything dangerous like that like other people experience. I’m more just curious as to why and how I could maybe get them to stop because they can not only be very distracting in school and things but also they’re really distressing and upsetting coz they are quite scary. They make me feel like I’m being surrounded and mocked and threatened and it stresses me out that I can’t make out what they’re saying. 
Whilst I’m here I may as well mention another completely different thing that I get often as well which I’ve never told anyone about which is where randomly I have these “episodes” where everything around me in the world becomes really fast and intense all of a sudden and it feels like all of the sounds around me are like almost echoing and kind of like they are mocking me even though they are just sounds so they can’t really mock me? It sounds stupid I know but yeah all the sounds around me become like 10 times more intense and loud and it’s kinda scary as well. Everything almost feels not real and when I come out of it I feel like I just made it up and like it didn’t actually happen like I imagined it and I almost can’t really remember what I did during that time (probably because it’s really distracting and it takes up all my head space so I can’t really think) It’s really weird. These “episodes” can last from like 5 minutes to about an hour but the normal amount of time they generally last is about 30 minutes. Again it’s really hard to describe and I’ve tried googling it but I can never find anything so again I don’t know whether it’s anything to worry about or not. I’m just curious if anyone gets either of these things or what they could be caused by. ",02Feb2019,1
91,"I was looking through trueoffmychest and this lady said her husband had split personality because he lived two lives and cheated on her etc etc and she didn’t find out until after he died. 
It kills me to see this kinda of stuff since I myself do In fact have Dissociative Identity Disorder. Movies like glass and split are really making it hard for people like me to come out about their disorders. It’s sucks Hollywood gets to do whatever they want with no consequences. Giving false reputations and showing no fact or information in the disorder. Only making a spectators sport out of us. And now doom patrol is coming out with crazy Jane. Joke being the actress claims to be an intersectional feminist in her instagram bio. Funny how people can pick and choose what they support when money is involved, or it doesn’t involve them. She is literally going to create so much stigma, and open soo many more doors for other opportunities to be made. Harlequin was altered in her role for the sake of peoples feelings and thoughts. Yet Trauma survivors everywhere that suffer from DID just don’t seem to matter?


I live in fear and shame when I shouldn’t have to. I’ve lost friends and family to this diagnosis. I’m feared suddenly by people who I’ve enjoyed for years with no issues. Everyone just wants to paint us as monsters. When in fact DID is only a coping mechanism. We are all born multiples. And around the age 7-9 we integrate. But my brain never allowed me to do that because of the repetitive abuse I had endured at such a young age. I’m more likely to hurt myself than anyone else. I’m tired of having to live in shame and in the shadows. It’s so hard already to get help with this disorder!! There is so little information on it, some therapists don’t even believe in it being real. I just want to scream and cry and punch shit. It’s not fair. I’ve been hurt so much in this life already. When will people realize they can’t just self diagnosis and slap such damaging labels on people. When is someone going to stand up against the stigma?

93,"So starting off I'm from Germany and bot a native speaker. I'm just looking for advice , since my friends don't really care about my relationship. 

I feel kind love with my bf December 2017 and may 2018 we started a relationship. Since the beginning of the relationship I didnt like his girl best friend . They were good friends as kids and found each other again , but they kept their distance. Around October 2018 I gave up stressing about her and she and me were not friends but I accepted her . On new year's day he broke up with me , but since we were also best friends comforted me . A week later he confessed to me that he kissed her on the day he broke up and that he started to fall in love with her. And my main goal went from making him love me again to making him love me again by getting her out of the frame . 
So I reached my goal after like two weeks and we got together ,they didnt have contact anymore. 
We were happy in the relationship, but now I'm kinda not in love anymore . But I dont want to lose him since he was my first bf and my first time and etc. and I dont want to lose everything we fought for . I'm clueless and cant make up my feelings and decisions. 

Any advices ? ",02Feb2019,1
94,"So this has been nagging at me for awhile, because I just cant figure out how to deal with it.

I had this coworker at a this little pizza place I used to work at, and for reasons I've yet to fully understand, he began being really passive aggressive and shitty to me after 5 months of me working there.

&amp;#x200B;

For the purpose of clarity, I'll give him a fake name so all the ""he"" pronouns don't get confusing. I'm gonna call him ""Dick"". Originally, he never said much to me when I started working there, but eventually when we did start interacting, he was very friendly to me. We even went to a coworker basketball game together. He was kind of always obnoxious and little misogynistic, so I never liked him that much, but I would pal around with him at work because often times it was just the two of us working during the day.

Then, I got a tiny promotion, that wasn't even official, from my boss, and Dick started acting very weird. When I first told him about the promotion, he said ""you know that's not a real thing right? You don't actually get any authority."" To which I replied, ""yes, but I'm just happy because it means he's happy with my work."" 

Over the course of the next few months, Dick became more and more of an ass. My boss tried to get him to train me to do grills as part of the promotion, and Dick would make excuses as to why he couldn't do it because he was ""busy"".

Then came all of the comments. I would move a pot to a different burner to cook something and I would hear him loudly say to my boss ""Any reason the pasta pot is on the front burner and not the back one?""

Obviously my boss would say he didn't know, and then Dick would huff and move it. 

And, ""Someone who's not a delivery driver should probably move their car"" he would shout down the hall when I was the only person in earshot and my car was parked outside. 

The list goes on. 

And he would do it everyday about everything he could, and he was the only person I worked with during the day full time. He would even say things like ""Oh did (my name) make that salad? I'm gonna have to check that. She doesn't fill it up enough"" to my boss. Basically any effort he could to try to diminish my abilities and make it seem like I wasn't capable of doing my job, even though I was very competent.

Eventually it got to the point where he made me cry one day because I got to breaking point with his passive aggressive bullying. I was over by the grill area about to obviously make an order, and he struts up and shoves his 6"" 7 300lb+ body in the tiny space right next to me to the point where his shoulder is making full contact with mine, and quickly reaches over me to take the ingredients and start making it himself. Then when, surprised I said, ""Oh...can I make it?"" he said ""No, go finish doing cheese prep"".  And I knew all of this was overt because I heard from other coworkers that he would talk shit about how I didn't deserve a promotion. I hadn't been there long enough blah blah.

He's not my boss or a manager, and I technically outranked him, yet he commanded me like I was.

The whole time I felt like I was being bullied emotionally, and even in some cases like the grill incident, I felt like he would use his large stature to intimidate me/ shove me out of a space.

He also used to do this thing where he would block the hallway while using one of the large appliances and refuse to step the side when I needed to get past. So, I had to walk all the way around through another hallway. But, for everyone else he would move, just not me.

I tried ignoring it. I tried killing him with kindness. I even tried talking to him during a lunch break and asking why it seemed like we weren't friends anymore and like he was upset with me. Nothing. Nothing worked. 

I don't work there anymore thank god, but i keep wracking my brain about how I should have, or could have dealt with it better. Like either have gotten him to relax, or kept him from getting in the way of my work in a calm way. But i cant figure out what i should have done differently, and I worry about what I'd do if I ever encounter this again. Thoughts?

P.S. I spoke to my managers about it and they sympathized but acted like I should have gotten over it. Even my boss noticed his behavior and played it off jokingly by saying ""hey people only act that way if they really hate you or really like you."" What the hell?!

96,"  

I feel torn. Lost. I can’t open up to someone, but I want to. Why can’t I open up? What do I even open up about? Why am I sad?

I feel like crap. I’m sad, hiding in my room. To afraid to talk, to afraid to show my weakness. Can’t let my parents know, they are 10 meters away. Open to my problems. But it’s “my cross to bear”.

I pinched and dug my nails into my arm. To distract myself. I don’t want to hurt myself, but what else do I do to not feel like this? 

I don’t know why I feel sad, like crap and worthless. Why do I even write this in English? To make it “less real”? Why do I think about posting this online? I don’t want people to know. Still, I want to talk about it. WHY AM I LIKE THIS????

My life is good. I feel content with what I’m doing. I’m getting good grades, I have good friends and I have even three future careers planned. I'm only 17. I have my whole life ahead of me. What have I to be sad about?

It comes and goes. I’m torn, I’m fine. I’m happy, I’m miserable.

I must hide my tears. My pain. My confusion and my problem. Bottle it up, make them disappear.   
I don’t even know why I’m sad, so why can’t I just bottle it up, forget about it and be happy?

This is the first time that I feel this shit. I’m on the verge of tears. Fighting them back, pushing them down.

Why am I such a hypocrite, telling others that they can and should show emotions. That asking for help doesn’t make you week or worthless. To not bottle it up and hide your feelings. When I do and feel that myself?  

Why am I not happy with myself? Why do I see myself as fat, why do feel conscious of what I eat? Why do I feel a bit of shame about the candy I ate, or the second portion? I’m not anorexic, I'm just not good enough.

I have studied a bit of psychology, I know the tells of depression, anorexia and other. But I’m not depressed, nor do I have any other mental illnesses that I know of. But why am I torn, day after day. Week after week? Why do I want to cry?

Why do I want help, but not tell anyone? Why am I afraid of talking as well as staying quiet?  
Why am I like this?

97,"I was watching a film today, and it really hit home. It was about a person who was a bully as a kid, and now as an adult he was trying to make up for it. At the beginning of the film he attempted suicide. He'd lost all of his friends, and hated himself.

Whilst I was never a bully. I've done things I'm not proud of. a few years ago I thought of myself as a kind person, but in reality I was far from it, Because of that I pushed everyone away. I lost my friends slowly over the years. Lost my partner because I couldn't see that I was part of the problem, I saw others mistakes and didn't try to see their side, I neglected to take responsibility for my own actions.

I realise now that a lot of things were my own fault, or at least, I didn't help the situation.

I'm not looking for forgiveness, because it's something I will never deserve. I just want to be better in the future. Be a kind person and help others. I've started working as a carer to work towards that goal, but honestly I don't see much redemption for myself.

Is it possible to be a better person? Do I deserve to be better, Or would it be better to remove myself from the equation? Last year I tried to kill myself. But all I realised is that I would bring pain to the few people I know who care about me; my family.

Maybe I would be better to live alone, seem happy to other so I don't cause pain. And hope I fade away so people forget about me.",02Feb2019,1

It's hard to explain but I'll try. It's like there is something in my field of vision that I hadn't really noticed or payed attention to, and then suddenly it's like it moves and it startles me and makes me notice it. For an example if I'm sitting at a table drawing or something and there is a glass on the table. It's in my field of vision but I haven't noticed it. Randomly I'll just see it make a fast movement and that's when I notice the glass. This happens with items as small as a coin to larger things. It's freaking me out and it makes me uncomfortable.
