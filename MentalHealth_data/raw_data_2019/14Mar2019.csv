2,"My husband is currently almost incapable of communicating (he can speak just fine usually), so he can't tell me how to help. I know what set it off and can't do anything about that now but every little thing is too hard for him. Dropping something out of the full recycling bin is enough right now to push him back over the edge and into a full on melt-down. Leaving him alone doesn't help, cuddles don't help, leading questions cause distress. I've ensured he's eating and drinking and I'm tending to the areas of the house he usually handles. I'm at a loss...I don't know how to help.

I hide what's going on with me at the min due to fear of not being seen as a 'strong leader', but trying to hide it from people who are trained to recognize it is super hard lol ..... anyway iv started smoking cannabis which genuinely helps de stress me but due to being in the UK and the laws regarding weed I'm feering if I'm found out I'd loose my job..... you think I'd know better being in the field of mental health but I have no coping mechanisms so smoke up instead, anyone else have the same sota thing going on?

4,"I constantly deal with this overwhelming feeling of loneliness, it physically hurts. I’m not friendless though, I have a lot of people who say that they love and care for me, but being around them doesn’t alleviate it. I guess it’s that cliche of being in a crowded room and still feeling lonely. I think that a part of me keeps myself from connecting with people and forming a bond. 

I would really appreciate advice about how to go about addressing this. I really don’t want to stay this way for the rest of my life.

5,"Before I start, I don't even know if they're tics. I've never seen a specialist, and I am not in the best position to see one at the moment. I hope to be able to in the next few years. 

I have two major ""tics"" that have been the bane of my existence for a while now. The first one is a lot easier to explain, so I'll start with that one.

It has to do with my legs. Whenever I sit with my legs bent, I  get this feeling in my knees. It makes me have this uncontrollable urge to stretch my legs out. Whenever I can't do that, my breathing gets funny and I get anxious, almost frantic. It makes it harder to sit in certain places, like when I'm eating at the table for example. 

The other one is...a bit more strange. I've had it for years and I've never seen or heard of anyone else having it. 

I'll explain it the best way I know how. 

Imagine you're sitting at a desk. That desk is coated with a thin sheet of flour. Whenever you move your hand or rest your arm on the best, the flour slides and created a little pile, an inconsistency in the fine sheet. So, I move my hand to smooth it out or push it away. But wait, now that I've done that, the pile it only bigger, or there's more piles now. And it just keeps doing and going. It's the weirdest thing. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone even heard of this? Depression, anxiety, and Bipolar Disorder all run in the family, and I've had trauma in the past, if that helps at all. 

Thanks so much to anyone who's read this. It means more than words can describe. ",14Mar2019,2
6,"I’ll preface this by saying I’ve had two suicide attempts in the past; the first was more a cry for help, the second was incredibly serious and I had completely stopped reaching out to people, planned it for six months (I had one last thing I wanted to do) and did not tell a single soul. I’m only alive today because my mom came home early that night by crazy coincidence and found me in time to get me to the hospital. I have severe type II bipolar (manic depressive) that has been mostly treatment resistant due to my borderline personality disorder (yup I hit the happiness lottery.)

I’m struggling with loss right now. No one close to me has died; rather, I feel like I’m no longer important to them and they’ve exited my life. My best friend of ten years has stopped reading my messages altogether, and my dad blocked me on all forms of communication after a falling out which started with me asking him to help me make copays for therapy I desperately need. 

Yesterday, an old friend left a pretty intentionally mean response to a comment I had made lightheartedly roasting a mutual friend (this has pretty much always been the nature of our friendship.) I got defensive, then messaged him privately to tell him how it made me feel, and also apologized for coming off as short. He basically told me 1. That’s not the “proper way to respond to criticism 2. It doesn’t matter how I feel about it 3. He “wasn’t unaware of the tone” he used with me in the original response. 

Honestly this has sent me over the edge today. I don’t have proper coping skills to just let this go, and I’ve spiraled down to “wow so it’s confirmed. No one really does care about my feelings and they can be intentionally hurtful to me without regard.” If what he had said really *was* criticism (“hey, that came off as kind of mean. Maybe try toning it down a bit next time?”) I would have immediately realized he was right and apologized to my friend. But he just attacked me, and then told me I wasn’t valid for being upset about it nor was it proper for me to be. 

I deactivated my Facebook account and blocked him, but it’s driving me crazy. I’ve recently been having more frequent suicidal ideation, and that’s not a good sign because of my past. I just got myself back in school. I moved to another city to be closer to good friends. I’m trying my best. Yet I feel like I just can’t get it right. I’m also beating myself up that I’m not just thankful I do have good friends where I am now, because I keep telling myself they will eventually leave me too. 

Any advice on how to effectively let things go and derail negative racing thoughts would be helpful. Especially from anyone who suffers from bipolar, BPD or both. I am really struggling. ",14Mar2019,3

11,"So, today I got the news a student on my school committed suicide, I wasn't close, but talked to him sometimes. Yesterday a close friend of his was crying because he was missing and told me and a friend about him and how he talked about suicide, and some other things. And today, when they told us that, I just cried a lot, and I didn't even talked to him, there were people who talked to him way more and didn't cry as much, I feel like I was faking, I don't know, it just doesn't seem right, I thought it was because I knew something others didn't because that friend that talked to me yesterday, but the girl that was with me didn't even cry, and she was really close to the friend that told us that. Or maybe the fact that a few months ago I was feeling like doing the same he did, which I also might have faked. I don't know, I already tried to post on Reddit about this but I always ended up feeling like it was stupid. I get it if you think im being an asshole, I just need someone to tell me what's going on.

I just feel like shit because I almost didn't talk to the people who actually talked to him, and they are my friends, it seemed I knew him better than everyone and people actually came to see if I was ok, and that was awful, I wasn't the one who needed help, I was the one who was supposed to be helping, but I was needing selfish.
I know I was wrong and I just shared this so you can know the kind of person I am, but I just want help about this feeling that my emotions are fake, if anyone else feels like this, anything. I want honesty, if you think I was an asshole please tell me, I really want to change.

I had a fairly traumatic childhood with a good dose of verbal and psychological abuse from my father. One of the many things was a very active discouragment of showing emotions, especially crying. Ever since then I have felt as if all my emotions are turned to the lowest volume. I do have them, or at least I think so, but it often takes exteneme situations to feel anything besides baseline. I never really get excited, or sad, or embarrassed, or happy. My strongest by far is anger but I have worked a lot on it since I was young and have it under better control than most I know.

21,"Hi there. I am 25 years old and have been in a healthy relationship for over a year now. I was diagnosed with adhd in November last year and my whole world flipped upside down. Everything feels different now. This is a hard story to tell and I just wanted to get it out there. I’m stuck unlearning and relearning behaviours that work with my adhd, so oftentimes I have trouble navigating social cues and situations. 
The thing that is affecting me is that a year and a half ago I was raped by my best friend. She and I had met when we were fifteen, and our friendship was to go on for another ten years. The both of us were new to the school and became fast friends. (For information sake: I am trans ftm, and she is a cis woman)
Flash forward, she was struggling through some mental health issues and a bad break up and I was there for her, wholeheartedly. I loved her fiercely and wanted her to pull through. During this time her behaviour was more and more irrational and impulsive. I was worried but having a lot of experience and knowledge with mental health in my family, I had tools and methods I could do my best to implement in order to help out my friend.
I stayed at her house one night (I lived two hours away via public transport). She lived with another person who had friends over; the father to her three year old, though the parents weren’t together anymore but living together. 
The father was in the other room with his friend and their daughter was with grandparents. I was with my old friend. She came into the bed with me and we just lay there, hugging, which we have done before throughout our relationship. I thought nothing of it.
Then out of nowhere she sits up and asks if we could ‘share our bodies’. I go into fight, flight and freeze mode. I am frozen and uncomfortable. I couldn’t form words and she proceeds to undress me while I tell her I am uncomfortable. Pointing out people are in the house, telling her I don’t want to, and she does anyway. My mind went blank and I just wanted it over.
When she was finished, she suggested we leave the room at seperate times to make it look less suspicious.
I basically sat there in shock, dissociated from my body. Somehow ended up leaving shortly after and catching public transport home.

I just remember crying and feeling disgusting all the time.
Fast forward to now, she and I aren’t friends anymore. I asked for accountability and was met with childishness and projections and defiance. She blocked me off social media. I haven’t spoken to her in over five months. 
I have a severe lack of trust in basically everything. Not to the point where I am pushing people away, I’m just not communicating in general. I don’t speak with my mother and sibling often at all. Don’t speak to any old friends, haven’t made new ones in a long long time. My relationship gives me the space to be real and vulnerable with my learning and growing. So it is because of this space I have that I am able to articulate my experience and it’s circumstances. 
But all in all, I find myself isolated and lonely and afraid to let people in because I fear they want something from me. It’s difficult living in a sense of space that feels anxious every moment, or when someone texts me or calls me I am riddled with anxiety.

I’d love anyone’s advice, or if anyone has been through something similar.

That's good. Sometimes, I just feel like you're disconnected from the real world. I swear you post more stuff about games and decorations than you actually spend talking people and then talk about how you're depressed, tired or don't feel like doing anything. Well, if you would actually have more human interaction instead of sleeping for hours and playing games even longer, that'd probably help that. Actually spend time with your friends more often. When we all got together, it was actually awesome and had fun. Just like old times. But sometimes when I'm in town, there's no initiative to get anyone together. I haven't met your gf/fiance yet and you haven't met mine either and that's pretty sad considering we used to be a little closer than that. Is there initiative from Mikey? Yes. Brian? Yes. Even Juan and he's in the service and is barely even around. Hayworth is kind of a hermit and always has been, so I can see his excuse. Sorry to rant. I'm not meaning to. It's just frustrating that this is how it is lately.

I want to see you more often. I'm telling you man, the day Sriggs came to town and went and ate lunch with Brian and I was freaking awesome! And getting to workout with Brian every day, the comradely that comes along with pushing each other to get better, and then there was the day you and i worked on our head-casts, man it was a blast!

FRIEND 3 (2008-PRESENT)

Well, since we are all bringing our feelings out. I don’t know where to start with this. I honestly don’t think it matters what say because I feel like it all goes in one ear and out the other. To put it blunt, I feel like I’ve put grown you. I feel like not a damn thing we say matters and I’ve began to kinda part ways with you. I hate saying more then I can express but it’s constantly something. A post about depression, a post about anxiety, a post about what you bought, where you are out at, what you’re planning to buy. Dude don’t your parents still pay your bills? That’s pretty messed up man. You’re almost 30 and all you’re worried about is what you’re going to do to your game room instead of not putting your adulting all on your parents. I know I’ve had my fair share of not wanting to adult and it took me being in a serious relationship to get my head out of my ass. I don’t think you’ve had that serious relationship but I also never depended on my parents either. The girls you have dated in the past few years have been way to young for you and I don’t just say that because I don’t like Becca due to what she did. I say it because it’s the truth. I’m sure none of us started this conversation to bash you or attack you but you have 3 friends all telling you the same thing. Where the fuck is the Matthew I used to know. The Matthew who had the leadership to run a halo clan and actively gain new members? People you didn’t even know?

25,"New to this sub, so I hope this is the right place to share / vent.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up with authoritarian parents who were really strict and forceful in controlling my behavior. My dad was always an intimidating figure in my life. He never liked when I got too hyper, too happy, or cried. If I was ever doing something that he didn't like he would punish me physically and verbally demean me. When I first started preschool, I would always cry and he would shut me in the closet until I stopped crying. There are many more stories similar to this. Most of my memories of my childhood are tied to these types of situations. Overall our family was pretty cold, we never talked about our feelings and emotions. I was never given positive affirmations or compliments. Our family also never hugged. I would attribute the parenting style to a mixture of our cultural background and an attitude of ""gotta toughen up the boy"" as my parents were never abusive towards each other or disciplined my sister as harsh.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, I'm not resentful of my parents. I don't hate them. My relationship with my family was never close, but it never bothered me anyways. My mom calls me about once a week and we chat, but that's as much communication as I give and take. I've reconciled with my childhood as my parents waned their abusive tendencies towards me in my later teenage years and I've come to rationalized it as ""they did it for my own good"" and ""they had the best intentions"".

  
Obviously from the abuse and lack of love, I have some trauma, which I've only recently come around to admitting to myself. I don't have any known mental illness or behavioral problems, I can handle stress, and I have a pretty normal social and professional life, except I CAN'T CRY. I can count the amount of times I've cried between my teen years to now on one hand. In the recent years, I've gone through breakups, unexpected and stressful job losses, deaths and I never once was able to cry.  


I've realized from an early age I became really good suppressing my emotions, good or bad. I never really feel extreme moments of joy or sadness or anger. Everything feels a little numbed out or doesn't last as long as I want it to especially in exciting occasions. I'm emotionally calloused and coupled with the lack of experience of sharing my emotions and feelings, I feel like I'm emotionally dumb. I would say I've set up a wall around me to protect myself from feelings, but I don't feel like that's the case. It's becoming a problem as I'm trying to build romantic relationships and I can't communicate my emotions effectively and I end up sounding like I don't care or their problems don't matter.

  
I never knew that not being able to cry was such a weird thing until I started sharing my experiences in the last few years. Since then, I've kind of made it somewhat of a goal to solve this problem. I feel like if I can learn to cry again, I could better express and communicate my emotions better.

I try to carry most of this on my own but sometimes I try to talk to him and he doesn’t understand it. He can be very kind but he can’t help me feel more secure. And then I get more afraid that because he knows I’m broken that it’ll turn him off and he’ll find someone who isn’t as fucked in the head. I almost feel like I should be dating someone else because there isn’t an understanding there. He will never understand what this kind of low self esteem bullshit feels like.

29,"So I've gotten therapy and all in all I'm doing much better since my diagnosis. 

But there are some big-ticket items where trying a new thing brings me to a point of absolute *rage* because I feel I don't know how to approach it, and I'm in a situation where there's pressure and the people around me expect me to just get it done.

There are some little things that give me a lot of anxiety, if they're necessary but I don't do them often. Like going to the post office or getting a tuneup on my car. If I'm with a friend, it's almost guaranteed I'll piss them off because I crawl out of my skin in these situations, and none of them can empathize. 

The key contender, and inspiration for this post, is I want to start being active and working out. Mostly to feel good, but also to look good. Every time a friend tries to show me a workout, I want to try all the other things, and I get frustrated when I don't pick them up or enjoy them right away. My friends get very frustrated with me for not just sticking to the routine. But I know I want something very specific, I just don't know what it is. And I can't explain my reasons for disliking something. It makes me feel like a child. 

Here's a text exchange with a friend to give you a sample: 

&gt; Also can you help me build a workout 

&gt; I want to only do workouts I like 

&gt; I want to climb and swing from things and hang upside down 

&gt;&gt;Where do you plan to do this?

&gt; Idk hopefully someplace convenient
 
&gt; That beach had stuff 

&gt; I just don’t want to go to a gym and have no idea how to use the equipment 

&gt;&gt; Just go there and climb you don’t need a program you won’t follow it 

&gt; Lol but I wanna know what each workout is working 

&gt;&gt; I could suggest my gym for the 100th time since that’s a lot of what is done 

&gt; If the program is fun I’ll follow it 

&gt; But I don’t wanna work til failure 

&gt;&gt; Then don’t workout 

&gt;&gt;I don’t workout to failure at that gym 

&gt; I just wanna feel the burn 

&gt;&gt; Then go swing at the beach. 

&gt; I just wanna understand it better
 
&gt; like which muscles which thing works 

&gt;&gt; Then look up YouTube videos
 
&gt;&gt; Or talk to the guys at the beach 

&gt; Okie doke 

&gt;&gt; Reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine

&gt; I feel like it’s a really hard thing to get unless you’re already in it 

&gt; Like I asked on Reddit and people were just like figure it out 

&gt;&gt; Asked what? Follow the recommended routine

&gt;&gt; You have nothing to figure out 

&gt; I need my own routine 

&gt;&gt; No you don’t 

&gt;&gt; Stop making this impossible for yourself and everyone 

&gt; Yikes sorry I asked 

&gt;&gt; It’s like I’m trying to help you but you reject everything I offer
 
&gt;&gt; So I can’t help you if you don’t listen 

So you can tell I want someone to hold my hand through things like this, but it's not reasonable to expect that of others, and I can't stop pursuing new things just because there's no one who will baby me through it at my pace. 

So... anyone else's OCPD manifest like this? How to you manage? ",14Mar2019,1
30,"So before the last year I feel like I was the kid that wasnt to shy or too intrusive, just kind of there, which I felt like was my place, I enjoyed just kinda talking to people whenever. I could start a conversation and continue one, not really acting odd while doing so. But recently (about a month ago die to personal stuff that Id rather not talk about, its not severe I just dont feel like talking about it) I had an extreme wave of crippling depression that basically turned me into an aggressive hermit. After some self reevaluating I was able to pull put of it. But I havent felt the same, I feel like I cant start conversations without the other person judging me or I somehow fuck up the convo and saying something stupid. any suggestions?

32,"Hello! So I’m (F 21) and I’ve suffered from mental health problems since middle school and wasn’t even diagnosed with depression till my junior year of high school. 
Well anyways fast forward to my first year in college, everything’s dandy. I’m on medication and going to therapy shits tight and yeah it was going pretty well fast forward to December of 2017 and I met this guy! He’s fantastic in Every way! We’ve been dating since the day after Christmas and things were going great! 
Up until a few months ago... I will admit that I fell back on taking my medicine regular and now I completely stopped going to therapy due to high waits (month/month and half out) and I don’t have it in me to open up to someone all over again and things have just gone down hill. My boyfriend goes to school 3 and half hours away, we recently got a puppy a few months back that made me her sole caretaker while he’s at school and mind you we have also two cats, two guinea pigs, and a created gecko. Don’t get me wrong I love my animals but sometime it’s just so over whelming to take care of them all myself and I’ve quit two jobs since this all started happening again, I’m having emotional outbursts (getting excessively angry, then excessively sad) and the past few weeks all I’ve done is sleep and not eat, I think I went four days without eating. And I get so worked up over little shit (like pretty sure I lost my Juul somewhere today) and ive lost four of those things. And I feel like my mom and my boyfriend get the most wrath but at the same time it’s hard because all they want to do is blame it on my mental health and that’s it and I need to get over it. I just feel like they dont really listen to me like I don’t know what to do I literally told my boyfriend I was selling my laptop (even factory reset the thing) and told my mom that I’m getting rid of my clothes (literally ripped everything out of my closet and dresser and threw them in boxes. They’re still there even) and after I cried into my dogs back for ten minutes I came to realization that I’m better off dead since no one even acknowledged me and then I felt guilty about thinking it and cried more 
I just don’t know what to do. ",14Mar2019,4
33,"Not sure where to really post this but I’m trying to change my way of thinking. For starters I get jealous of the most minute things, I am extremely self conscious at times and have bad depression and anxiety. I have been cheated on in a past relationship and it really messed with my head, I am constantly paranoid my current girlfriend will leave me or cheat on me, etc. Often I feel as if I’m unliked and unloved, I generally feel unwanted most of the time. What can I do to change this? I’m tired of being bitter, miserable and would like to change my way of thinking and am seeking help before it is to late. I am dragging others down with me. Please help. ",14Mar2019,1
34,"From November to middle of February i was in a horrible place mentally. The worst it has ever been. I ended up back in therapy and chose to take antidepressants for the first time in my life. 

Enter the beginning of February. I tore my hamstring and didn’t know it. It swelled up and i couldn’t use my leg at all because of the pain. I got misdiagnosed by 4 doctors. It ended up being a serious infection in the hematoma. I ended up in emergency surgery to drain the infection (ended up being 17oz of pus drained). I was in the hospital for 7 days and about night 3 it went septic and i for sure thought i was going to die. I have had a midline in and have had to be loaded with antibiotics at home the last two weeks. I just finished them tonight and go back to see my surgeon and infectious diseases doctor tomorrow to judge if I’m in the clear. 

The weird thing is, after seeing my life flash before my eyes and thinking i was dying, this is the happiest i have been in ages. I can’t explain what it is or why i am so happy now. I would’ve thought my anxiety would’ve been crazy bad worrying about the infection coming back and killing me this time but I’m just not. 

So i guess the reason why I’m telling this to a bunch of strangers is that no matter how bad things may get, they will always get better. And that if you’re willing and want to fight for the betterment of your life, you can do it. And personally, the amount of drive I’ve had to get better proved to myself that i truly don’t want to die and that i love my life a lot more than my depression was telling me. 

Sorry if this is irrelevant or dumb. I just had to get all of this out of my brain. ",14Mar2019,4

I am currently a freshman in college, majoring in electrical engineering. For the past months, I feel that I have conscious pressure to compete against those around me (roommates, friends, classmates, etc.). I've put a lot of time into thinking about why I do this, but I'm not sure. I do not feel jealously or envy for other's success in academics/careers, and in fact I am very content with my own life, and I wouldn't trade it for any other. There is just a constant disappointment in myself that my peers are working harder, being more productive, and putting more time in than me.

40,"I’m not sure if this belongs in the mental health subreddit or the gaming one but my problems mainly arise when I’m playing online competitive games, although it’s the only sort of thing I compete in so this may stem outside the realm of gaming as well but I’m mainly here to look for people who have similar issues  and have found techniques that they use to help themselves. I have a very hard time losing while playing, and I know that sounds stupid and whiny but I do. I acknowledge I do and I want to change this and some days are obviously better then others but I just can’t, I get so caught up in my own headspace and get so self punishing when I lose it’s really embarrassing. I begin to shout things at myself when I start performing poorly and eventually it can lead to cases of self harm. Not that I reach for a razor blade and cut my arm or anything but I do often punch myself in the face of hit my head against a wall or punch a hard surface with the purpose of it to hurt my hand. I’m not so much a sore loser to the others I play against but more to myself but like I said it’s embarrassing and ruins my headspace for awhile and I become self depreciating. This doesn’t happen so often when I’m playing a team competitive game because I understand I’m not in complete control, a good example is when I play League with my friends not only is it a combination of all our mistakes that lead to our losses but I’m never fully at fault either because I main support bot lane with my friend so when we lose it’s never entirely one or the others fault. I mean that’s not to say that their haven’t been games where I make a bad baron call that loses the entire thing when we get wiped at the pit and give them baron or something but that’s far and few in between and the support from my friends really helps me. Everything changes when I play a game like Smash, which is one of my favorite games but it’s also my worst competitive game. I get into such an annoying mindset where I mentally punish myself for every single little mistake I make. falling for a bait or not learning the other players fighting style well, my worst is when I fall for something the other player sets up over and over and I absolutely lose my cool and just can’t play for the rest of the day on top of that I’ve practically screamed my head off and beaten myself up to the point where I’m just sad at seeing myself act like such an idiot when all I want to do is self improve and be able to play the game without freaking out. I’d like to be able to go to some local tournaments too but I don’t think I’d be able to handle it, I don’t think I’d go crazy in front of a bunch of people as I usually just do it alone (or sometimes in the discord) but I think I would be so awkward after losing a fight I couldn’t handle it I’m so lost I just want to be better but I consistently try everyday and I make little to no progress can anyone help me?

41,"I've been given a pretty good life, but I've successfully fucked it over beyond repair. I started really isolating myself freshman year of high school, I never had any real close friends. I jumped and looked away whenever someone tried to talk or look me in the eyes and I had multiple nervous breakdowns in class. One day I said the words ""I wish I  wasn't here anymore,"" which prompted the school counselor to call my dad so he could take me to get evaluated at a hospital. He screamed and cried on the way there, my oldest brother committed suicide so it was a very sore subject for him. Anyway, I ended up not going to rehab, but I did drop out of high school junior year to enroll in a high school online. I ended up going to a college and my dad forced me to get a part time job. Everyday is fucking agony, I feel so alone and miserable and I have no idea what to do. I am 19 years old and I have the option to put myself in a rehab or something, but I'm scared of how my dad will react. He is 75 years old, going through a lot of financial strife, and was really proud of me for getting a job, like really really fucking proud. I don't know what to do. I don't want to go to school or work or anything I just want to give up and die and I just can't stand anything anymore.

42,"I've been in a spiral for a couple of weeks now. It hasn't been calling-out-of-work-cuz-i-cant-get-out-of-bed or having-a-entire-bag-of-chips-as-my-only-food-spurce-for-two-days debilitating, but it has made things like maintaining conversations--even ones over IM or text--or getting out of bed to get to work on time or staying up for 4 or 5 hours with no nap on any off day difficult. I've been feeling disconnected almost all day everyday.

And my boyfriend has been having a bit of a stressful week. Just today he was ranting about how life sucks and that it isnt possible to be passionate about a job to the point where you wake up and actually are looking forward to work. And how it's hard to be passionate about a lot of things because everything is used for wasting time. He struggles with depression, and he hasn't been on meds for about a year because he doesnt have health insurance (he should have some soon, so hes planning on looking into places that will take him).

Normally, I'd be patient and try to point out positives about his points, but given how I've been feeling, Its hard to stay present for more than a few minutes. And as much as I try, I struggle to find positive things to say. I get frustrated, like what's the point in trying to say something if it wont change their mind. I shut down when I've come to the conclusion that nothing will move us forward or backwards, which I guess shuts down the conversation.

When he said that it's not possible to wake up and look forward to work, I at first tried to spin it out to be at least a little positive. But after maybe 7-10 minutes I sneered ""well maybe you should try being less cynical"" I'm honestly not sure if he heard me, he didnt seem to acknowledge it.

He told me later in the day that our conversation was thought provoking and he thanked me for it. But still....I feel ashamed.

How am I supposed to be supportive of my boyfriend when hes going through a hard time when I'm shutting down conversations with dismissive remarks? How am I supposed to help him feel better when I get impatient about everything and just stop it? I cant pull a kanye west and go ""I'll let you finish cuz I know you're sad/frustrated...but I just want to let you know that I'm feeling so out of it and despondent that I'm incapable of helping you with this. I was depressed first! .... ok, carry on""

I know it's not my job as his significant other to fix his problems and improve the quality of life and person as a whole. But he cant afford any sort of professional help, so I feel some sense of duty to help him. And its not like I can shut him out every time hes going through a tough situation simply because I cant properly handle it.",14Mar2019,1
43,I’m at 21 year old male and I’ve recently been experiencing some very weird moments of depersonalization... I think. I feel like I’m not really “present.” There are times that I find myself drifting away from reality and begin to question if I’m even really there. The best way I can describe how I feel is like I am stuck in a dream or I just woke up from a long nap. I find myself beginning to panic because I’m not catching things that are happening around me. This causes me to ultimately shutdown. I have a counselor but I don’t feel like he really understands what I’m feeling. Right now I’m on Buspirone and fluoxetine. Would these be the reason I am feeling this way? I rarely drink but when I do the depersonalization/derealization I feel is significantly worse and it lasts for weeks. How do I overcome this? Or is this something I will have to deal with the rest of my life?,14Mar2019,3
44,"Ever since I could remember, my parents would tell me “there’s the good pleasant you, and then there’s the mean you.” It affected everything in my life and I began noticing it myself. It made me depressed because I didn’t realize why I wouldn’t control my mood swings or be consistently motivated to do things. 

I remember I would go through periods in my life growing up where I would have unhealthy obsessions with things and for weeks straight I would lock myself in my room and do those things. I remember one time when I was 8 I stayed in my room everyday after school painting my nails and then removing nail polish, cyclically. My parents thought it was weird, but I just wanted to do it. I then dropped it a few weeks later 

This is true for almost anything I do in my life , hobbies, relationships, goals etc. 

I’ve also had a really hard time making and keeping good friends  because I’ll make connections but then the next week I’ll withdraw completely and avoid any human contact. 

I was diagnosed with bi-polar II disorder when I was 17 (I’m 19 now) after my parents found out I had an opiate addiction and I spent months at an outpatient clinic. 

But I didn’t  “feel” bi-polar. I didnt see the signs. But recently, my boyfriend said the same thing to me my parents said to me growing up and it struck a cord. I’m just so confused and I feel so disassociated. It’s so frustrating! 
I feel so productive and creative some times but then other times I just feel like I’m the worst person in the world and it’s beginning to affect my long term relationship. 

Im starting to think I actually am bi-polar and it makes me scared. But, I just feel so embarrassed and I don’t want to get help. I also don’t want to go on any medication because I’m against chemical aids. 

I just feel so hopeless and invalidated. Maybe I’m just making this up in my head. I don’t know.

Or maybe I’m supposed to feel this way? Maybe what I’m feeling is completely normal and I’m blowing it out of proportion as an excuse for my own weakness.  

TL;DR: i was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder 2 years ago and didn’t believe I had it. Now I’m starting to realize that maybe I do.

48,"My most frequent example is this:

(1) I make an error with something at work, or something similarly shitty (but not that grave) happens. I catastrophize and feel terrible about myself. I doubt my abilities and value as a person.

(2) Afterwards, EVERYTHING is a problem. My mind jumps around for more reasons to feel unworthy. Sometimes this results in a lonely sadness and wallowing with too much wine, but sometimes it affects those around me. For example, I’ve lashed out and treated my boyfriend like a punching bag on more than one account. For whatever reason, I’ll all of a sudden be SO upset about the tone of voice I imagined he used with me. Or I’ll be upset about him forgetting to return a text from earlier in the day. The kind of stuff that usually rolls off because I know it’s not malicious, but sticks to me in these moments because I’m *choosing* to be upset. 

I think what I’m perhaps doing is some form of cognitive dissonance where I don’t think I’m warranted to feel as upset as I do, so I seek out more reasons to corroborate my feelings. Or perhaps it’s a masochistic tendency. Or perhaps it’s because anguish is so familiar after all of these years.

There is no concept behind story behind my past, just many random pain I got from them. I feels really bad like something inside keep swelling up and consume my inside at the same time. My mind start to losing consciousness while my body isn't it's like I'm going to lose my consciousness and live like mindless automatic doll.

Even though I have my goal but I have no fuel to go for it. Every damage I took for 20 years killing me, even though they're just embarrassment and failures, I had been put into shame upon every mistakes. I got scolding to just silly mistake, I even got revile for every single action I took. Once I was like 10y/o I stole money from my grandma for only about 3USD, it's not a lot even in my country at that time but she put me to shame, she even announce around the village that I am a thief.....Innocent mistake and not forgiven or explain, immediately put me into that state. Teachers also done the same thing in every mistake that students make, others laugh at them like a joke but you know what? It's terrible, I feels like I want to kill them slowly torture them and heal them up until they can't hold anymore pain and wishing to die right there. I hold everything back and pretend like I am a good boy, even though people around here put dirt on my name or dirty me with shame I still have my honor to keep....they're just a pleasant even though the reality is I am the same but I feels myself as something higher than them, I feels that I have more intelligent than them while at that I also think myself as stronger and sometimes I even fear that if I touch some fragile human they will disperse by just my touch.

I don’t know what the cause of this is, I am seeing a therapist for unrelated reasons. I feel like i just have too many thoughts in my head sometimes. not bad thoughts, just...thoughts. I am tired, I am confused, and I just want to sleep. I’ve tried talking to my therapist about this, but it’s expensive and i thought maybe this would be better. i just. want to know. what is wrong with me. ",14Mar2019,2

The few friends i have left school, so I’m completely alone there, and my home life isn’t much better. Don’t get me wrong I couldn’t ask for better parents but I’m pretty quiet and tend to just lock myself in my bedroom. I wish I had a better relationship with them but I can barely manage to make smalltalk with them let alone have a meaningful conversation, my social skills are abismal. I feel like such a drain on them, they give me everything and in return I lock myself away and never speak to them. I feel like I’m treading water, and instead of struggling everyday just to maintain my pitiful existence I should just give up and drown. But then again I don’t hate life I just hate myself. I feel like I’ll never have a decent job, never have a group of friends and never be able to connect with my family. The only reason I haven’t topped myself already is because of the prospect that maybe someday It will get better, but I really don’t see that happening. I don’t know why I’m posting this on here.

For the first time ever I did some physical activity other than working laborious job and walking/running/cycling (very casual). For background I’m not unfit, fat or skinny either, I’m fairly average size, slightly leaning toward the skinny size,  average height, weight and fitness, quite lazy however and I do eat poorly as in 1-2 meals a day not the healthiest food. 


So I did a self defence class today for the first time and they work us to the bone. 
I managed to compete with everyone else and finish the work out, without quitting or stopping at any time (I wanted to but I just kept pushing through, same pace as everyone else). After the work out I felt tired as shot, exhausted as you do, and felt like vomiting, and light headed and like I was going to pass out but I didn’t pass out but 20 minute after the work out I vomited, it was all just clear like water, probably was and then when I caught the bus home (30 minutes after workout) I just had this sudden rush of all these depressing thoughts, felt unloved, useless, just I dont know just solid depression. felt like actually wanting to die but I didn’t want to kill myself at all I just don’t want to live, it weird to explain but definitely not suicidal. 
I feel like all these demons and issue that I’ve just been burrying and suppressing have just come to light, I came to the realisation that I’m majorly depressed and I’ve been hiding it for years
Now 3 hours later I’m not feeling not as depressed, I’m slightly better and back to kind of back to normal, but have this lurking idea that I’m just bottling up all these issues still. 
I go to a physiatrist for my ADD and I’ve been to a few psychologists before but during this episode I’ve realised I particularly lie to them and tell them everything is fine because at the time it is but their are these underlying issues that have just come to light and I feel if I do go see some one again I’ll just lie to them or not tell them anything. 
And im just kind of lost because while now I do feel slight normal, I do feeling like I need to sort these issue out because the are present. I’m just seeking help or advice is this something that happens when over physically exhausting your self for the first time.  I just don’t know.

On the surface believe I am normal as I am married and work a corporate job. I also do regular guy stuff like going to the gym and spend time with my wife on the weekends. However, i think i have a weak state of mind. I tend to over worry about specific things in my life - like my job and what i will end up doing in 5 years. I have been in my current company for 5 years and the past 1 year has been very tough. I've missed out on promotions due to my own carelessness and not been selected for any leadership training's. I work in sales and my company is an extremely KPI driven company.

The biggest problem i face is i tend to get stuck thinking a certain way and ruminate on problems in my life. I get overly worried and this gets me down. My biggest fear is letting down my wife.

72,"I am sorry for this long essay but I really need your opinions on this cause I don't know what to do. 

I'm a 21 y/o male. I live in Singapore, we have something called National Service where every male citizen is forced to serve in the military for 2 years once they turn 18. I began my service 9 months ago as a transport operator (I drive cars and trucks around and get soldiers where they're needed).

I have always been a little anxious about things, but lately I have lost all confidence in myself to do anything that I am not very familiar with. I find myself getting anxious when doing tasks that should be simple, as if I don't trust myself to do it right. I'm afraid of making mistakes and getting punished or causing problems for other people. 

This only happens when I'm in the army, I become alright once I head home on the weekends. I am extremely frustrated with this, when I become anxious I end up making more mistakes, and the problem gets worse. 

It started during basic military training, I had to deal with the disruption to my civilian life and had trouble adjusting to the training, and the loss of my privacy which I value more than anything else. I screwed up alot of times, and got labeled by my section mates as ""blur"" (someone who is slow and incapable). They ostracised me which made my training harder than it needed to be. At some point several people including me screwed up during a parade rehearsal. Afterwards this loud, thuggish guy decided to single me out in front of the entire company for the mistake and embarassed me by making fun of my horrible acne. I hid in a stairwell and cried that night while calling my parents for comfort. Eventually I made it through basic training and went for the driving course, since I was supposed to be a Transport Operator but didn't have a driver's license yet. 

The driving instructors used to train transport operators like me are extremely unforgiving in general. They will scream at you for repeated mistakes, which are difficult to avoid while learning as driving in the military is much harder and more strict than driving as a civilian. Imagine having a scary looking old guy sit and yell next to you when you're trying to concentrate on the road. Many of the instructors seemed to have this mindset that they needed to be more strict with me in order to teach me how to drive. Most couldn't understand that their screaming at me stressed me out and caused me to make ridiculous mistakes like mixing up my left and right. I earned a reputation among all the instructors for being a bad driver. At some point while driving a 3 ton truck during training (with only a few months of driving experience) I made a serious mistake which could have caused a death if there was someone standing there. 

I have since completed all of my training. My driving has gotten much better. But all of this has made me deathly afraid of doing anything that I am not already extremely familiar with, to the point where it is affecting my ability to be a soldier (I don't want to, but I don't have a choice) . The people in my new section are all very friendly, but they don't really understand why I am always so anxious, I don't dare to explain why and I am worried that they will ostracise me once I make enough mistakes just like my old section in basic military training. 

I have only told my best friend about all of this. He has anxiety issues and is considering therapy. I am wondering if I should consider it as well. 

So my question is, what do I do? Is it normal to be like this or should I get some professional help? ",14Mar2019,0

I was happy-go-lucky to a stupid degree and genuinly laughed out loud to movies, forum posts, articles , all of which sont register anything anymore.


I have to so consciously think of everything im going to say now , my spontaneity is gone , my humour is gone , im gone.

My smiles are fake and my laugh is fake not because im masking sadness there is nothing beneath the mask. I cant even express how much i miss laughing , like really laughing its been years , how did i forget how to?! 
Ive got a somewhat convincing fake laugh so im not just sitting emotionless when something 'funny' happens but it leaves me feeling so empty everytime.

I miss feeling happy/human/etc.

Any advice will be appreciated , i half made this post to vent i suppose. I've been hating myself and what ive turned into so much recently but even that is probably some artificial excuse for hatred because i dont even think i can muster that anymore.

77,"Original post here for those who are interested: [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/aizgmo/im_scared_ill_be_told_theres_nothing_wrong_with_me/)

TDLR: I was overwhelmed and took my first appointment with a psychiatrist to figure out what the eff is wrong with me. Was scared I'd be told nothing is wrong and I'm just wired like this and I'll just have to stop being dramatic and suck it up and deal with it. That scared me because it would mean I will not get relief and just have to go on being so unhappy and having things be so hard all the effing time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also worth mentioning is that I had sought help at that point because I am in the process of applying to a masters and it was **very important** to me to be accepted, and I needed to write papers and letters and needed my wits for that. I didn't want to fuck my life up because of my issues, and this was a critical time where my future would be decided.

&amp;#x200B;

It is now 6 weeks after the first appointment. Here's what happened:

&amp;#x200B;

**-1st appointment:** I told the doc *everything.* My symptoms, fears, the hesitation, the fact that I was broke and couldn't afford much therapy (his visits are 80$ each...), everything. I also told him I smoked hash almost daily to keep my mind slowed down because without it everything gets in ""fast-forward mode"" and I was at a place where I was done hiding from my problems and wanted to stop smoking and face the issues head-on. I told him I didn't want to self-diagnose but that I had already strongly related to high-functioning Aspergers and/or OCD/OCPD. He *literally* laughed in my face and said you don't have autism or OCD. It hurt more than I can put in words, made me feel dumb and dramatic and like I was trying to sound smart when I wasn't, or trying to look interesting with a ""fashionable"" illness, or trying to ""pin"" my issues on some illness instead of taking responsibility (I actually told him this and he replied with ""well maybe you are"" in a joking tone). Like I couldn't possibly have any idea what was wrong with me, and I shouldn't try to figure it out on my own.

He latched onto the hash thing and wouldn't let go. Said that all my anxiety and de-realization and paralysis and depression and social issues are stemming from my daily use of cannabis. He told me he couldn't diagnose me before I was sober for at least 2 weeks. He gave me Gabapentin, told me it would help with the withdrawal. It sorta made sense, and I took an appointment for two weeks later. I was vaguely disappointed, as I did not feel heard or understood, but I reasoned that he was the doc and not me, he was just doing his job and that I had to be sober for that. Fine.

Those two weeks were absolute hell.Not only was I adapting to being sober, but the issues I had covered with the hash band-aid were now all flaring up together. I was yoyo-ing between extreme moods, feeling uncontrollable rage, getting in pits of depression, getting overwhelmed (feeling ""vibrate-y"" and dizzy and almost drunk-like), driving recklessly, sleeping a lot, etc. I kept the end goal in mind. ""I will get help after this, just need to get through it"". 

&amp;#x200B;

**- 2nd appointment:** two weeks later, devastated but hopeful, I go to him again. He asked if I was successful in not smoking, I proudly said yes. He seemed not to believe me and asked several times. I told him I had hash at home, my friends all smoke, and I didn't even think about it or feel any urges. I just wanted to move onto the real issues. He says that all of these issues are withdrawal symptoms, and that he can't understand if the issues are real or not unless more time passes. I got pissed and thought ""well you could have told me this before, instead of getting me here to pay 80$ more just to tell me to come again in 3 weeks"". He also said that the worst had passed and that I should up my gabapentin dosage. I asked him ""*but what do I do?*"" He said to try listening to soothing music (yes, seriously) and to exercise. I told him I already swim 4-5 times a week, eat clean, meditate, I make sure to get sunshine and fresh air, to see people who make me feel safe, to stay active, etc, and none of this is making a dent in my issues. He just said to find good music again. 

I was beyond pissed, but also insanely insecure. I felt dismissed and almost ridiculed for even having brought the issues up in the first place. I mean I can't even put in words how disappointed and rejected and confused I felt. Was he right? Was I just a normal human who happened to smoke a lot and now I'm paying the price? Was everything fabricated in my head? Was I being dramatic? I mean after all, he's the doctor. If he says there's nothing wrong with me then there's nothing wrong with me. Right? I fell deep. It was so hard to process. 

But, through all the doubts, there was always a little voice telling me that as much as he knew, he couldn't know more than me about me, and **I** **just knew.** I knew this was not normal. I mean I'm not an idiot or a recluse, I know other people and how they feel and process things and react and live, and I read a lot and research a lot, and I know enough to know I am not like others.  It's okay to not be like others, and it's okay to need help and ask for it. However, this voice was not very loud and was often drowned by the self-loathing and doubts.

I decided to call his bluff. ""You want to pin all of this on hash? Fine. I'll come back in three weeks and we'll see what you have to say then"". I thought if he stays on his stance that this is nothing but withdrawal, then I'll just get up and leave. I'll save up some money and when I can, I'll seek a second opinion. He's not a god and can definitely be wrong. Screw him.

&amp;#x200B;

**- 3rd appointment:** I walk in to find a chick sitting next to him. He waits until I awkwardly ask what's going on, and he tells me she's a student and if I minded if she observed. I said sure go ahead. I started by asking if I could get off the gabapentin (which apparently you have to taper off of very slowly... thanks again doc, the box is almost 30$ each). He never even asked why (headaches and severe constipation), just told me it was harmless and that I could lower dosages for the next weeks until I see him again. He asked if I was still sober, I said yes. He seemed pleased. He asked how the 3 weeks were, I told him I was still having a lot of issues, mainly uncontrollable anxiety over tiny trivial stuff, looping thoughts, bursts of anger, getting easily overwhelmed from ""outside world"" interactions, needing ""recovery time"" after a few hours ""outside"", having immense issues concentrating, and the de-realization feeling when I get too overwhelmed. I was especially worried about the driving (danger for myself and others) and about my academic applications (not finishing on time or doing a subpar job and thus sabotaging my entire future). He looked... unimpressed. Like all of this was not that much of a problem. He asked about depression, I said the ""dips"" into depression were less frequent.

He said I'm much better even though I might not see it, that I was clearly less depressed and ""better"". And that all I was experiencing was (verbatim) ""just anxiety exacerbated by the withdrawal symptoms from stopping hash"". That I needed to just give myself time, and that things will get better. That I should make sure I'm getting enough sleep and exercising.

This time I just looked him in the eye with a ""wtf"" look. I was visibly disappointed with him. I kept asking him ""okay... is that all? Anything else you can tell me to help me deal with all of this?"" He said he could give me benzos if I wanted them. I said I didn't want another bandaid, he said okay then just give it more time"". I asked ""what about the driving? I mean I'm terrified I'll hurt myself or others"" and he just said ""no don't worry it will be okay"" with a look that I swear was a ""no big deal"" look. I asked ""anything else?"", and he said ""lower your gabapentin dosage and come back in 4 weeks"". I just stood up and left.

&amp;#x200B;

That was last week. It's been really, really hard processing all this. So much self-doubt was validated in this experience, and it's really hard to keep my chin up.

Luckily my partner and friends all helped me to understand that it's okay to seek a second opinion, and are validating my experiences by assuring me I'm not crazy, and this is not okay.

Part of me is saying ""he's the doctor, not you. He knows better. If he says it's just the withdrawal, then that's that. Just suck it up and get through every day. Life isn't supposed to be easy"". 

Another, now stronger voice is saying ""he was just not the right doctor. You deserve to be properly heard and helped. Sure, Life isn't easy, but it's also not supposed to be this damn hard"". I mean that's what I'd tell a friend if they were in this position. 

So I'm gonna save up some money and seek a second opinion. But I have to say, this was one of the roughest times of my life. Being made to feel overly dramatic by a psychiatrist is a hell pit. It's like being told life is an abusive partner and it will beat me up daily but all relationships are like that, and I could numb the pain but it won't stop so I just have to get used to it. Like there's no getting out of this toxic relationship. But I see and read about people who don't have this much difficulty living, and just imagining that gives me so much hope. Maybe soon I'll get the help I need.",14Mar2019,9

79,"So back in December my GP sent a letter to the mental health services referring me because we both thought I'd benefit from some more therapy (I had some CBT late 2017). I hate phone calls and I especially get anxious in the first appointment with mental health professionals because of bad experiences in the past which is why my GP got in contact with them for me.
Fast forward to last week and I had another GP appointment discussing how my antidepressants are going and if I had heard from them yet. I had not. My GP said she would send another letter but that they tend to prefer if patients refer themselves (which I and probably many other people find difficult due to my anxiety).
Yesterday I thought I would give try referring myself a go and found out I could actually do it online. In it I mentioned that my GP had sent them a letter in december.

Today I got a phone call. From the mental health service in my area. They said they had received my referral and said about booking a phone appointment. She asked me several times if I would be able to wait until the beginning of April. I said yes.

Why am I angry? Well it makes it seem as if the online referral I did yesterday was the reason I got an appointment. Surely a referral from a GP would be taken more seriously? Surely a medical professional writing a letter to them explaining my suicidal thoughts and self harm etc would be more concerning than some a person claiming they have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and suffer these things? And I have been waiting since December and the day after I do my own referral I get a call?

Also she asked me if I could wait until the beginning of April! I have been waiting since DECEMBER! Yes I can wait until April. If you were that concerned why didn't you get in contact with me before?!",14Mar2019,12

The symptoms keep making me panic about the panic and I’m not sure how to calm them? Do they mean that I’m simply not done panicking and need to give it a bit more time or what? I feel like that can’t be the case because they seem to be around constantly. I’m shaking and my chest is tight right now as I type this and I’m actually pretty clear headed at the moment being. 

P,S. Please don’t suggest seeing a therapist. I can’t afford one right now and that has been one of the million things that have making things worse. ",14Mar2019,3
83,"Ive struggled with keeping my piss poor mental wraps for years. At first I just didn't want them to worry or pity me. But as time went on, my health got worse. Thoughts more aggressive and my emotions became even more fragmented. Along with that my perception about my friends shifted drastically. I became convinced they secretly knew and only stuck around around out if pity. And if I still trusted me I just *knew* that as soon as I told them, they would be disgusted, or worse... afraid. So for years that was my mindset. *(I mean it still kind of is, but I'm getting better ok)* But yesterday, as chaotic as it was, was an eye opener. A chance to finally breath. I was  just goofing off with some friends talking and writing shitty music, when my laughter abruptly stopped. And I knew right there shit was about to go down. 
I started shacking and couldn't concentrate on the conversation in front of me. Normally I would excuse myself when things like this happen. But I just couldn't find the words. So of course my shacking didn't go unnoticed. The human equivalent of a bear of our group was instantly concerned, while my best friend was just confused and laughing about it. (He was trying to break tension)  and he stopped as soon as my shaking morphed into hysterical crying. And I just couldn't stop, the tears just kept coming and coming. But not once did my friends judge me, they comforted me the entire time.  And unlike my insecurities foretold, we've become even closer as friends.

I had been putting it off a lot but it felt weirdly relieving even just. Going there and getting an intake done and scheduling a session, and having the appointment card in my planner. I still feel pretty fake about it, like I'm just making stuff up but, at least, now I can tell someone about that, too.

I hope things go well, and I hope everyone is able to find some kind of help, even if it's hard to start looking or hard to start asking for it. You're all wonderful and deserve to be happy. ",14Mar2019,2

86,"Okay so I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for basically ever. I had an alcoholic father growing up and have been in abusive relationships that, at this point in my life, I know how had an effect on me. I’m seeking help for these issues, that’s not my problem. 

Yesterday, a friend of mine said “yeah, I can tell you’re really damaged”. And it really messed with me. 

I try so hard to not project my issues when I’m with friends, at work, at school, etc. Obviously, I can’t always be totally okay (is anyone?). I’m working on these issues, also, but now I feel like I’m not doing as well as I thought. 

I’ll admit that lately things have been rough, which is why I’ve decided to seek therapy again. But I always try to keep it to myself. I don’t know if any of this makes sense, but it kinda hurt my feelings to hear that. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, but either way I don’t feel like it was my friend’s place to comment because we weren’t even talking about that kind of stuff. 

I haven’t really spoke to this friend since that comment, I just kinda stopped answering. Tell me I’m being too sensitive 😅",14Mar2019,7

I'm usually fine but every so often I get really demotivated for a few weeks and don't want to do anything and usually my grades in school drop. I also lash out at my family a lot more and argue more :/

Also over winter break (I'm a freshman in college) I thought about suicide sorta seriously for the first time ever but I couldn't think of a way to kill myself and then the feelings went away and I felt great til now. I thought that was just a temporary thing but the past week or so I've been feeling pretty meh and sleeping a lot, and I skipped class today for the first time. I'm not as bad right now as I've been before but I have a lot of important stuff coming up that I'm worried I'll end up not doing and then feeling worse because of it. Also my closest friends struggle with some mental health issues so I just want to get over this so I can be there for them and not just drag them down or end up avoiding them because I don't feel like doing anything. 

Is there anything I can do? I know I should probably see a therapist but I don't think I could trust the school counselors, I don't want to tell anyone about winter break but I feel like it would be pointless if I didn't so there's no point.

I'm not gay but when guys come close to me or touch me, or even just joke and maybe flirt a little, I become extremely attracted to them and think about them all the time. Sadly one of my friends who is a massive extrovert and social guy, he flirts with everybody including me (he's not gay) and he's charming, and I'm just sad that I will never get to hug him romantically, it really makes me depressed.

I'm an extremely quiet guy and don't speak to people much, so my colleagues at work generally approach me rather than me approach them, sometimes the older ones (40+) will flirt, call me gorgeous &amp; babe, etc. and it just really hits that spot inside of me and I think about it on a daily basis. One of my coworkers who isn't even attractive at all, she calls me gorgeous and she touches me on the shoulder, she playfully hits me sometimes and just generally flirts with me - now I'm extremely attracted to her.

It's been a month since a rough breakup where he told me he was essentially using me to get what he couldn't from his ex, used me for sex, then dumped me hours later. I'd fallen for him and took it really hard and still am. I work in the same hospital as him and the ex and leaving isn't an option yet. That and getting rejected by the school I had my heart set on a couple days later set me in a rut. 
The past couple weeks it's all been coming to a peak. I have generalized anxiety and I can normally talk myself down from the panic attacks from that. Now im constantly crying, anxious at work, losing weight from barely eating, and thoughts of either self medicating or hurting myself. 
Logically, I know this isn't a solution and will do more harm than good. But it won't stop and I'm just at a loss. I'm scared of getting help because it's such a small community and I work with a lot of the healthcare providers that would be my options in seeking mental help.

99,"I'm not the type of person to post such stuff. I seriously had to think for five minutes if I should try and explain this to someone, and my hands are really sweaty as I'm typing.

The problem:

I've already been experiencing this stuff for a year, or maybe more.

I have always something in my peripheral, I can't even explain exactly what that is, but whenever I try to get a good look at it, it disappears.

Then, I also hear sometimes faint sounds or voices. For example, yesterday I thought my dad yelled my name, so when I came down, everyone seemed to be chill in the living room like nothing happened.

And then there's this thing that bothers me the most.

My memory.

I start to forget.

Memories that I once had, they're gone. I know that I remembered a moment when I was 5 years old, but now it's all blurry. I can't remember the memory as vivid as I could. I could've even forgotten things that I could recall previously, but I'll never know because I forgot them. That memory loss is the thing that most heavily impacts my life, ny grades, everything. I can hardly remember yesterday.

And it's getting worse! 

First came the faint sounds, then the peripheral vision thing, then the memory loss. But I can't remember when the memory loss thing started. Maybe it all started in a different order but that's how I remember it.

I tried talking to my mom about it, or my sister. I didn't try to talk with dad about it because he either would freak out because he does so with even little cuts that I get, or he might just as well think I'm making it up. Both cases would be bad. Mom wasn't a fan of going to a psychiatrist or something. And whenever I try to address the whole thing to my sister, I eventually shrug it off because I'm worried she won't understand or she'll judge me.

So yeah.
That's it.
I honestly just want to know what I can do in my situation. I'm 13, I can't make a appointment to a psychiatrist, and I'm not sure we have one because my city is small and not really a wealthy one. Plus I live in Russia and almost everyone here isn't a fan of going to mental health check-ups and stuff. About check-ups, my mom told me recently when I asked her if I ever went on a mental health check-up, and yes, I did, before kindergarten. 
My whole family is skeptical about mental health. They never said it directly, but I think they think about mental health problems like that:

I know that I should probably go to a doctor but at the moment I don't have the money and I don't want to worry my parents for no reason. I was never diagnosed with anything, but I've never went to a psichiatrist or psycholog (in my country this is still sort of a tabuu topic). I have noticed that sometimes I'm mean with my family or friends without any reason, I feel like whatever they do annoys me and I find joy in not helping them, but then I feel bad about it and try to change whatever I did/didn't. Lately my bf for 6 years suggested that I might have a mental disorder. He says I am actively trying to destroy him and ruin his life, but I just can't see it. I feel like everything I do, I do out of love. I think I might have lose it cause when he tried to break un with me I cut my arms and then said I would kill myself. After it happened I realised that it was stupid and I told him that, but I can't seem to stop these psychotic moments when I'd do anything not to lose him. And this happens only when we talk, cause if I am with someone else I can detach and see what I'm doing wrong. It's like there are two me, but at the same time just one...

106,"Hey, I'm a 17 year old guy. I've diagnosed with depression and ADHD about 17 years ago now.

I go to film school. I left high school early cause I got this opportunity. Ever since I was a child I wanted to make movies to entertain  and inspire people. I've also loved making music from an early age. So I made it my life goal to have an impact on this world, by creating something special. It was one of the main reasons I kept going, cause I use my fucked up brain as an inspiration for everything I create. ""It will all be worth it in the end, it will get better and then you've learned a lot."" It was my lives purpose. That was a thought that kept me going. It was something I believed for a long time, but I don't know if I do anymore. 

But when I got the opportunity I decided to follow my dreams and my passion, leaving everything and everyone behind. My supportive friends who always where there for me when stuff got to much for me and I wouldn't be able to go on anymore or broke down, they would always be there to drag me trough the day and make me see tomorrow and make life a little bearable. My English teacher who was a mentor for me and always encouraged me to go on, and follow my dreams, and helped my with my problems if i needed help, and just always was there for me. 

They school I go to now is a 2 hour train ride, so I have about 4  hours of travel time every day. This means I'm away from home from 6:30 Am to 7 Am. And then I still have to work on my projects at home for about 4 hours on week days and 12 hours on the weekends. I almost never see my friends anymore cause I don't have the time anymore. And it makes me feel so alone. School is incredibly hard for me, cause I still have the breakdowns and stuff, and sometimes I just need a hug or just be able to talk to someone for a few minutes to get up and keep going. But they people who provided that and got me trough those days are not there anymore. 

I'm an extremely social person, and I can just talk to everybody. But for some reason I just don't feel like I can trust anybody at this school. And this stuff makes me feel like I made the wrong decision to follow my dreams when I wasn't really ready for it. 

But every day, every moment, every second when I'm not working on my dreams and passions, someone else is. And especially in the field I wanna work in (writing and directing) there are really limited places, and that person who is working on it harder than me will get that spot. And I just feel like I'm failing at my dream and my passion. I just don't have any motivation, and even when I have motivation I can't get myself to work or do the thing I feel like doing or I am inspired to do. It makes me feel like a failure, all my projects are fucking garbage (even for 1st year film school student standards.) Cause I  barely put time in them and barely have the motivation to even work on them and finish them. 

I just feel myself getting worse every day, I've been to multiple therapists and psychiatrists and nothing seems to help. 

I keep pressuring myself in 2 doing more and working more and more, and when I allow myself to take a rest I just can't cause I feel like i need to work, but I can't. I physically can't, it's an internal war to get myself to work on stuff. Stuff I love to do.  Stuff I never had any problems with doing till like 2 years ago. I felt horrendous and I didn't know why I even kept going but that kinda inspired me. Right now I just can't anymore. It is all to much. And I'm not the only person who forces myself to work harder, my teachers also force e to work harder, even tho they know sort off what I'm going rough cause me current psychiatrist called with my school.

It feels like I'm not good enough to reach my goals. Cause I put minimal to no effort in to it right now. And that brings me down. I'm in a loop. I can't work cause of how bad I feel, but not working only makes me feel worse. I feel like I'm never gonna reach my goal with how it's going right now. And what is the point of staying alive if I can't reach my goals and dreams.

I love making music and it satisfies me so much more than what I'm doing right now. Only I barely have time to make music anymore cause of school, and it isn't really that I'm working at school, but more trying to get myself to work at school. The internal battle takes up 90% of that time, and then I only manage to do something really fucking small, like write 1 line or edit 1 clip. I just don't really see a future in making music, cause it feels so much harder and rougher than film.. I know that is probably bullshit tho... And even if I would decide to take up music to reach my dreams, I would have  to finish 4 more years on this school cause otherwise I will have to pay a lot of money I don't have. (Cause that's how my country works, I'm not gonna get in to the details cause it's a little complicated.) 

Also I'm scared about getting rid of my depression, I know this sounds really fucking weird cause I wanna get rid of it so bad.  But it's the main inspiration for all the ""art"" I create.. And I don't know how I'll go on being creative and be able to reach my goals without it.. It's toxic. It feels like my creativity is toxic. I use my depression to create stuff, but of how much I use it it makes me feel so bad. But creating stuff makes me proud and a little happier . I can't stop using it, even tho It kinda feels like it's slowly killing me.

It just feels like I don't put enough time in to working on it..

Ever since my grandma died 3 years ago I started to hide my emotions for my parents and almost everyone. I had to take care of everybody, cause they got so sas, and it felt like my responsibility to make my family feel better. My parent's also couldn't handle how I was feeling and every time I talked with them about it they got angry at me, cause they couldn't handle it. They just started screaming and forbid me from being alone ever cause they where scared I would kill myself.

Ever since then I started to hide my emotions, they only emotions I ever showed where at my old school where I could be myself with my friends and they supported and helped me. And are the reason I'm still here to this day. I miss them, and I can almost never see them cause of all the time I put in to school. 

But ever since I'm at film school I have to hide them 24/7. And i just start to have anger/sadness (cause they are starting to become sort off the same thing) outburst randomly cause I can't handle my emotions at those moment cause it gets to much for me. It literally feels like I'm physically exploding 24/7. Like there is a abnormal amount of pressure that my soul applies on my skin while trying to get out of my body or something, It's the best way I can explain it. There is no other way I can explain it. I've had this feeling ever since I was depressed I think or as long as I can remember but it unbearable they last year or so, and I really just wanna die, cause I'm collapsing under that feeling.

Those outbursts got me in to a lot of problems the last few months, I constantly have fight's with my girlfriend over nothing. ( She also deals with depression and I don't wanna put all the weight of my feelings on her shoulders.. she has enough she already struggles with)

And I think the most impact full one. I got in a fight with my best friend 2 months ago.  We've both struggled with a lot of the same things for 5 years or so. And we kept each other alive all that time. We where each others listening ear when the other needed it, we have had moments, where we physically  had to stop the other person from hurting or killing themselves. But I probably had my worst outburst ever against her.. And I ruined that friendship. And I hate myself for it. She hates me now, and rightfully so.  I was a fucking ass, I was just a bad person during that outburst. But I've never been more sorry for something In my entire life. And she also said she didn't care anymore if I would stay alive or just die. I'm scared to fix it. 

But ever since that happend I've never felt more alone. I also just don't enjoy making films an video's as much anymore as I did before I went to film school, cause another friend who I always made video's with isn't there anymore, he was like my film buddy.

Everything is just a mess right now.

I also have a supportive internet friend group, but everyone lives in different places in the whole country so I almost never see them in real life. But I don't have like physical friends around me anymore.. and the ones I have I can almost never see. And It makes me feel more lonely then ever. And all the groups I work in at school push all the blame on me for not doing my work, even tho it is my fault. It sort-of isn't cause i just can't. It doesn't matter how haard I try I just can't do it anymore.

I'm failing at my passions and dreams and I just feel lonely with nobody really around me to support or help me when I have breakdowns, nobody that understand what I'm going trough. I don't even really understand it.  But life is just not worth it anymore. I want to die so bad.

They only reason I'm still here to be honest, Is cause one of my friends killed herself last year. And I saw what that does to people around them. And I don't wanna do that to the people around me, even tho it feels like I have nobody left around me. And also cause the last conversation I had with her was about suicide and depression. And at the end I promised I would keep on fighting and I promised I would stay alive. 

I just don't know what to do with my life anymore, i don't know where I am, I'm lost in my own head. I'm a failure. If there is even someone who read everything. Thank you for taking the time. It was really hard for me to be completely honest here. It is the second time i write this, cause the first time i accidentally deleted it and it ruined my whole day.

I notice every time I head into a bad depression, my comments on social media increase and become negative and combative.

113,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I went to Kaiser for my depression and anxiety issues.  However, this appointment did not go as planned with the psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context: I used medicines as a teen and had success with Lamictal, but I stopped taking them as an adult.  Last year I decided to start anti-depressants,  and I noticed an improvement when I was on Trentillix, on the advice from my nurse practitioner after prozac and zoloft did not work.  However, I switched over to Kaiser, and they refused to refill it.  Instead they gave me zoloft.  I did not see much improvement, so I ended up making an app with Kaiser's mental health department.  I went into therapy and I was much worse then than I am now.  We take surveys at Kaiser so they can see whether we are improving or worsening. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, I quit my job recently and I have been much less stressed than before and I am not as depressed.  That's not to say that I am not depressed, but it is much better.

&amp;#x200B;

When I went to see the psychiatrist  he said that my stats had improved since January, and he claims that he prefers me to try some ""lifestyle changes"" because he does not think medication will work.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was stumped.  I went in for help, but since my numbers had improved based on the surveys, so he saw no need for me to take medicine.  I tried arguing a bit, and at some point he said he would put me on Lexapro, but he did not seem to confident in prescribing anything so I declined.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do know?  I could make another app with another Doctor, but this experienced was just odd.  I feel like they were not taking me seriously.  My experiences with Kaiser have not been great, both on the primary side and on the mental health side... 

&amp;#x200B;

117,"My husband, 26, gets extremely frustrated by other people, particularly on days that have already been taxing.   
If at work he gets treated unfairly, or someone screws him up in a multiplayer video game, he goes on an incredibly nasty rant rampage. Face-to-face with people he's the sweetest and most tolerating person, but if there's a barrier between them (the internet, on the phone, or just a theoretical someone) he starts spouting out the most horrible things.  
""Those fucking krauts should all die, fuck all of them!"" is something he might say after losing a game to someone he thinks might be german for example.

And these rants go on, it's not just a single sentence. 

During the rampage he feels like the only way he'll feel better is payback. If his game got ruined, he wants to ruin someone else's. He has said he needs someone to blame, or otherwise it's his own fault and he ""can't have that"". When I've tried to ask him to move away from what's making him so angry, he always responds by saying ""What else am I supposed to do??"" 

After the initial rampage is fading and either I've begged him to stop saying hateful things or he gets banned from the game, he usually goes to bed and keeps sighing loudly, saying there's nothing he can do. I think what he means isn't that he's helpless but that he feels like his life is meaningless and there's no point in doing anything.

Eventually, usually the day after, he apologizes and we move on.

But today for the first time he threw items around. He tossed his dinner plate off his desk, and later slammed his phone on the floor. He has NEVER showed any signs of physical expression like that and although it didn't scare me, it hurt awfully to see him get so lost in anger. I went to talk to him and he said many times how he wants to kill someone, anyone. Again, not scary because he's not a violent person and physically weaker than me, but extremely hurtful to listen to.

He has a history with being bullied at school and one suicide attempt many years ago. He received some therapy back then and is still on medication.

\- - - 

So what can I do? I've tried to ask him to move away from the source. When he's cooling down I hug him and I tell him I love him no matter what, because I don't want him to feel personally responsible for getting overrun by the feeling of anger. It seems to calm him, but only once the initial burst is over.

To me it almost looks like self harm. Maybe it's just because of my own experience with it, but the way he spirals from being angry to being in a blind ranting rage just makes it look like he's doing it to himself. 

It's just awful to deal with. I'm open to any advice.",14Mar2019,3
118,"In the past 10 years or so I feel like I've finally got a handle on my mental health and most days I feel like things are going well, and other days I just want to shut everything out and take a break from it all. 

I mean, I managed to land a good job but so often it's just overwhelming and I feel like I can never keep up.  It might be my own anxiety but it causes a bit of stress. 

I also managed to find a great person that actually liked me and we got married.  But she has been becoming increasingly unhappy as I just don't seem to give her enough affection or start conversations enough, or I'm just not good enough at this or that or don't do this or that enough.  I spend enough time trying to keep myself happy it's so hard when I have another person's happiness on my shoulders too.  

I got really out of shape a while back, I had a number of health problems and nagging back pain in particular.  I've been exercising religiously for over a year, I've been lifting weights, doing yoga, playing sports, running, I try to do things everyone says is good for you.  And now despite trying to stretch and strengthen my back it is now 100x worse and near debilitating.  What the fuck was the point of all that getting stronger and more flexible if I'm just going to be in constant pain anyway?

Financially I guess I do okay but I usually feel like I'm just scraping by due to my lifestyle.  I changed a lot of my spending habits, fixed some bills, and some other things, saved a decent amount. I save for retirement and try to keep an emergency fund and do the things most people recommend.  But there's always something, either I need a new roof or refrigerator or pay for something unforeseen, I don't feel like I ever really have money just to spend on myself.  

I try to maintain relationships with friends even though I don't always have the time or the money.  I try to eat well and now I don't even really enjoy food anymore. I don't drink, smoke or do any drugs anymore. I work really hard trying to get everything right, but it seems like I never do and it doesn't really matter anyway.  ",14Mar2019,3

So  I have been a mess most of my life. I have half ass'd everything I have  done, I would sleep 12 hours a day if I could, and I was just in  general a leech on society. I could barely read or do more than 20  minutes of school work at a time.

A  couple of months back(after years of seeing some of the best  psychiatrist possible) I found a nurse practicioner who put me on 40mg  of adderall, 100mg of limitical, 30mg of propanolol, and 300mg of  wellbutrin.

We worked up to these doses. and added extra medications to correct certain things etc.

Well  now I feel for the first time in my life a functioning member of  society. I wake up at 6 make my bed, do my school work, clean my room  and groom myself.  For the first time I am doing things to the best of  my ability, and I am proud of myself.

My  wife who is in general pretty lazy person, yet has a great work ethic,  thinks I have gone crazy and its in general annoyed by my productivity. I  am pretty sure what I am doing is normal as prior to the limictal I def  had way to much energy. Now I feel just steady and productive. I should  mention I see my doctor once a week so I am sure he would have noticed  mania.

I no longer play 5 hours of  video games a day and instead will do things like school, focus on my  hobby of learning French organizing or cleaning. Albeit, I have ran out  of things to clean so I chilled out on that.

126,"I’ve always been paranoid for as long as I’ve known. Nothing traumatic such as a kidnapping or assault has happened to me. I didn’t have a great childhood (domestic violence, drug abuse with my parents...) but I’ve never had anything like a kidnapping happen to me. 

Ever since I was a small child I’ve been paranoid and thought anyone could kidnap me so I had to be constantly aware. I suppose I was taught stranger danger like a normal kid and never thought anyone OVER did it.

Now I find myself being in my 20’s - if I go out alone on a walk or to a park, I’m constantly looking behind my back (yes the creepy paranoid looking back action) and around my surroundings to make sure no one is following me. If I want to go for a walk outside (this is different than walking in the city) - I live in the suburbs - I’m too scared to do it alone. I can do it and do do it cause I have to sometimes, but I feel scared. I constantly feel like anyone at any point could kidnap me and rape me or torture me. 

When I meet new people for work (I freelance) I’m super paranoid about them lying to me and often create ‘safe words’ with people at home and I’ll tell them my location, my outfit, and if they don’t get anything from me by a specific time to call the police ASAP and don’t trust anything I say unless it includes the key word as I could be held hostage... obviously every time I meet people, it’s a normal work interaction. Never, ever had a bad experience. 

also when I know people, I still feel afraid they could be ‘grooming me’ to gain my trust which is EXACTLY what they want - to become a normal person in my life - only to one day kidnap and torture me.

I can still function daily life, it’s not like any of this actually stops me. But the point here is that I deal with a lot of unnecessary stress and paranoia and anxiety that has always proven to be for nothing. At night I’m VERY afraid no matter where I am to be alone.

3.) I was accused of sexual assault by a person who I trusted and believed that we were close within my friend group a few days ago, she changed her story fairly quickly and most people caught on fortunately, but it still affects me. I thought of her more like a sister.

134,"I am 19 years old from Czech republic. I have incredibly big problems getting to know someone at a closer level. Everytime I start liking someone, and they seem to have the same feelings, I go crazy. Start obsessing about them when we're not even dating, stalking them online, thinking only about them, unable to be a functional human being. This makes me very toxic and ruin the relationship before it can even start, because my brain just destructs itself from the stress. I cry about them not talking to me enough or looking at me a bit differently.  


I make them the center of my life, and I hate it. I am always worried that I could do more to make them fall for me faster. And I am terrified of the thought that this person, who is the most perfect human being I've ever met, could leave me at any point. And when they're not convincing me constantly of their affection, I am certain they're just not into me anymore, so I start freaking out, demanding to know the truth. Aaaand ... it's ruined.  


I am very afraid of for example leaving someone somewhere, I always have to be the last person leaving, and I am the one being left. Otherwise I'd be scared I'm missing out on something, or that I am letting someone wait for something that will not come, and I know how terrible it would be if it happened to me, so I never do it. I am rather the one getting rejected, staying until the completely bitter end.  


BUT - I started realizing where it stems from. I've had this issues even in kindergarten age. I remember crying myself to sleep every night, when I was like 5, without any apparent reason. I couldn't really talk to other kids, not sure why, I was somehow 'weird' so I got verbally bullied a lot in childhood. But I remember crying all the time for no reason, I just kept reading books and ignoring other kids. It's like I was depressed even at 5, is that even possible? I remember the mornings mom was driving me to the kindergarten and then leaving to work, and when she forgot to say goodbye properly I cried the whole day, I was feeling incredibly alone, scared she won't come back for me.   


I think those are the exact same feelings I am now experiencing in romantic relationships, I am too scared they will 'forget' about me whenever they stop showing me affection, and I am terrified of getting used by someone and hurting me.

136,"Hello. 

Short and simple.

2 years ago I started having flashbacks about a particular event and automatically response in vocal tics

(""leave me alone"", ""im an asshole""=, ""i can't take this anymore"" etc)

&amp;#x200B;

I started accepting this particular event and it stopped occuring. But the problem is that I started **intrusively** remembering more and more memories about different events from ANY age, from something embarrasing I did when I was 3 years old to something I did that morning (e.g I said something corny to a coworker, or expressed my emotions intensely to someone who might misunderstood me etc etc... pretty much ANYTHING comes up now).

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, when I think purposely about these ""uncomfortable"" memories, I get no such emotional response. Only when they come intrusively, usually by train of thought. Eg. I smell Ice cream, I start remembering tons of memories about eating ice cream, and as this train of thought rides, I fall onto an ""uncomfortable"" memory about ice cream.  Then I respond with a vocal tic instictively, and the intense emotion goes away.

I really feel like its getting worse. I worry sometimes that it might get out of hand. (Example...lately my vocal tics arent solely words...but sometimes grunts....like those people with serious illnesses make and Im worried)

In my mind are a few things. 

1. Some strange form of PTSD, where there is no single particular trauma but my whole life is consisted of multiple traumatic experiences.
2. OCD. My obssesions are thinking about the things I did or said wrong, and my compulsions are vocal tics
3. Brain damage from substances
4. Autism. I always had trouble connecting with others - made fun of in middle school. I believe I have high IQ
5. Schizophrenia - Schizoaffective disorder. I have many other weird thoughts but they never evolve into delusions, either because my really high IQ cancels my schizophrenia or because Its just anxiety. (Example. Sometimes i get the ""feeling"" that everyone can read each others thoughts to a certain extend, but its something that is forbidden to talk about, and its kind of a ""secret"".... Or that my life is the only thing that exists...or that when Im around people and they are having a private conversation, what they are talking about is hinting at me based on their assumptions of my personality. Of course I know these thoughts are not really true, but Im not convinced either)

Also my thought patterns are weird. Lately Im obsessing about death and just want to die because I get the feeling that death is the goal of life, not being depressed just being excited that I know that one day Im going to die and everything will be over and see what comes next.

I also do wonder what people think of me. Im scared that I come off weird or creepy even though I’m not going for anything like that. I’m a bit weirder and I don’t have much of a personality.

142,"Throwaway account - 

Trying to get some answers as to what the fuck is going on here I will try and keep it relatively short.

As this is on going and I'm not sure what is happening i'l replace actual names and locations.

Uncle is one of the nicest guys you could ever meet, never showed any signs of mental illness age for reference early 50's super chill and really easy to get on with. 


After my sister's wedding apparently my uncle started to show signs of Schizophrenia (pacing up and down at night time, not sleeping all night and hearing multiple voices) 

This all came to ahead when he and my aunty were out and pulled into the drive he then grabbed my aunty by the throat and said ""they are coming for us I have to kill you, and Katie (his daughter)"" his daughter is 10. 

He is a pilot so my aunty called his employer and have obviously taken him off work, they live in Minnesota and my neice is now between us and the inlaws. Uncle is now in a mental institution and my aunty has spoken to him a few times she is also still in Minnesota. Apparently he told her had a pact with the devil and the only way he can keep to his side of the deal is to kill them all. CPS has since been in touch and it sounds like he won't be seeing anyone anytime soon if at all. 

I can't believe this shit is fucking happening you read about it sometimes but it is literally like has had done a full 180 and just gone off the wall. 

As far as I know he was T total (very religious) what could have caused something like this it's bizarre beyond belief and obviously I feel terrible for his daughter. 

TLDR - uncle went full on insane insisted he had to kill his family. Is now in a mental institution.",14Mar2019,1

144,"I almost killed myself one week ago today.  I’ve tried three times seriously, and I was about to attempt for the fourth time last week. I was more ready to die than I had been ever before, I wrote suicide notes to my family and cried the whole time never even thinking about changing my mind (which was new for me because usually I had some kind of doubt in my mind). I was so ready and then all of a sudden I was fine. Just like that I was fine. It’s so confusing sitting here not even sure why I wanted to act the way I did and just feeling like I was another person from who I was a minute ago. I hate this, I just want to be normal ",14Mar2019,1
145,"Sorry kind of a long post, I just need to give the appropriate background.

I was in therapy and meeting w a dietician for my eating disorder over the course of a couple of years, end of 2016-2018. I stopped going to therapy, and was seeing my dietician on and off for a little while. We had a really good relationship! 

I do think we both crossed lines we shouldn’t have, I treated her more like a therapist, she treated me as more than a client. We were texting basically every day, I work in the same town she does so she’s popped into my job just to bullshit. I don’t remember the first time it happened or why, but it just became regular? Even after I started to take a break from her and was spiraling into my eating disorder as well as other mental health problems she still would text me or pop in the store to check on me.

Anyway, last June I had a suicide attempt, funny enough she had came to say hello that same day. My shit hit the fan that night and I just went off the rails. I was wasted and took a lot of Xanax. Anyway, I was somehow released from the hospital the next day don’t know how. I eventually called her and told her what happened. She continued to be supportive and helpful and really wanted me to go to this hospital that’s nearby. I had a phone intake and was going to go and I changed my mind last minute. 

Ever since then, she never contacted me again. I ran into her at Starbucks one day and to say it was awkward is an understatement. Since that day she would walk by my store REGULARLY, something she never did. Yes I realized she’s visited here, but unless she was visiting she was never walking by ever in the 2 years I had a “relationship” with her. I waved in the beginning, she ignored me. Once she waved to my manager when she didn’t see me- lol. After that I just acted like I didn’t see her when she’d walk by. 

Anyway that has stopped, it also is  winter so idk if that has anything to do with her route. 

While I was seeing her she wanted me to see this psychiatrist, I didn’t want to because she didn’t take insurance so yeah. Anyway I had obviously googled this women and I knew what she looked like. Well Monday she came into my store and like directly to me for help, tried stuff on but didn’t buy. She’s not in our systems and has never been in here before.

So I said something to my manager, and she said that I was crazy and it wasn’t some “covert” operation for her to see if I was here and report back. I have no one to really ask, so like do we think I’m crazy? Or is it possible my old dietician sent her to “check” on me? 

Also, does anyone think I should reach back out to my dietician or not because of that burn. If I did it would be for therapist suggestions, and then try to get back in with her but I’m not sure she’s worth it after leaving me high and dry!

If you read that, thanks! ",14Mar2019,1
146,"I am someone who was hated and physically and verbally abused for pretty much my whole school life (kind of a different metal kid). I also couldnt find friends to share anything with for a long time. When I did id do anything for them so they dont leave me..

 Its been six years since then and I have managed to find friends and build deep relationships but I still feel like I constantly need to be reminded of their love and I shower them with mine in order to avoid any chance of losing them. I deeply love both friends and partners, but this often suffocates them because as soon as they hold back or are in a bad place i immediately need them to feel good, to feel love, and to show me that we are okay. As a woman I am well aware that this never worked on any man in my life well and I am quite sure that it has a lot to do with my childhood abandonment issues. I struggle with this because  I wish to be a stable and reliable partner, but I cant. I end up requiring too much.

 I dont know where to even begin healing myself, I feel like the problem is too deep.. maybe someone can give me any pointers or had a similar experience. I will also seek professional help. Thank you ",14Mar2019,2

148,"I’ve been going out with my boyfriend 2 years now and he’s always had depression but has refused to ever get help so he’s just struggled with it. This last month he’s been the most depressed I’ve ever seen him and he keeps talking about suicide and saying he’s had suicidal thoughts. This worries me especially because I know a few years before I met him he did try to take his own life. I’m so worried and I don’t know what to do. He is literally my world and the only person I care about. If he did commit suicide I would do the same thing straight after. I’m getting so depressed by how he’s feeling but the more depressed I get the more he hates himself for making me feel this way. Then he wishes he never told me anything. I’ve tried so hard to make him happy over the 2 years but I just can’t. I try to be the best girlfriend to make sure he never felt that way ever again but he is. He says he feels nothing, like he’s empty and numb. He says he hasn’t had emotion in years since he was 16. He doesn’t feel happiness or excitement. I guess I hoped I would fix him but he won’t let me. I love him so much and I keep picturing finding him dead. I’m crying as I write this ",14Mar2019,2
149,"I'm a 18 yr old male suffering from deppression and anxiety who's basically just stopped going to school, unemployed and just ended a pretty horrible relationship. This relationship has been going on for about two years with this girl who had been diagnosed with DID earlier last year when we had a mini-breakup. I have issues when I'm alone so in that instance I reached back out again to her so I won't feel alone anymore and, again it was a mistake. This girls other ""personality"" is manipulative, sadistic and a heartless thing that tried to pry itself into my life to control me for it's own pleasure and satisfaction. I felt scared that it will ruin my life for everyday that I remained there, but it will if I left either way. I was conflicted. Thinking that it's better to be alone than to have somebody like that. Especially when I tried to talk to her about it, which was a wasted effort to try and make things work. She never took responsibility. Whatever she did that was horrible or wrong she'd simply say ""It wasn't me."" or ""It was her!"". This made me extremely frustrated and really pushed me with that idea of being alone is better. This all made me grow a distrust of whatever or whoever had DID because even when I knew her triggers and knew that it was ""her"" she'd still make it out that nothing she did was wrong.

But now a month had passed since I had succesfully broken free, and I feel alone again. I hate being alone with my thoughts and feeling that I will never be useful in the world. I feel like I should reach out again to pull myself out of it once more but I know that this cycle will only repeat. I have no trust with people anymore. I want to be alone but I can't and I won't but I can't.

So I've always been a super bubbly and socially active guy, going to pubs with friends, jokes with colleagues have always been my thing. 

A fair few things have gone wrong. I lost my grandparents almost days apart, my girlfriend cheated and my farther got two types of cancer all super close together. 

But I don't actually feel sad since losing my grandad. I don't mean repressed sadness but I've not been very emotional at all. I feel like I'm missing emotions entirely like I haven't worried about anything or been excited for a couple of years. I still function fine physically and I'm going out but it's like floating.

I still laugh and I can be happy, but it's not the same happiness. It's hard to explain, I don't FEEL depressed or anything but I'm not really sure what that does feel like. I find myself tearing up at things that I never would like sad videos or anything like that but again it just seems to come on with no actual emotion. I wish I could be more specfic but explaining it is hard.

My friends can't relate so I wanted to see if anybody has felt (or rather not felt) the same. Things just feel vacant no matter what I do.

153,"I'm 34 and I have clinical depression and anxiety. My anxiety keeps me up at night and my depression stems from years of physical abuse as well as my mother passing away when I was 14.

My partner also has depression and anxiety and I feel bad because well, I always feel like I'm last to be picked on the team, ya know? I don't have any real friends except one and he lives 200 miles away with no car so I rarely see him unless I drive down. 

I don't really have any friends here in town. I mean I have friends, the kind you rarely see every once in awhile, but I don't have any friends in the sense of friends that are involved in your life, or someone that wants to be part of your life. Almost all my friends are the Facebook kind. The kind that only keep up on an app.

I feel bad for my partner because she is my only outlet. I never see anyone, including my own family. My father has never been in my life. My grandparents have been long gone. I don't really have anyone. My stepdad only calls on holidays and that's it. Always telling me ""don't be a stranger"" even though I've made attempts to call.

I just feel like the only person I have is my partner. Anyone else feel the same? Anyone else wish they had others? I just hate that I don't have anyone here to go out to lunch with or anything.

I had no friends in my first two years of secondary school and was deeply depressed, I found a video online that told me not to care and over time I have numbed myself to most things. I’m always happy and bubbly I laugh at jokes and I used to feel sadness before I went on the contraceptive pill

I don’t really understand the idea of love or wanting to love someone, I’ve never loved or liked anyone as more than a friend apart from sexually, never romantically and for this reason I have never been on a date or had a boyfriend before. I don’t seem to feel emotions strongly and when I do I feel as though I can separate myself from them easily and forget about them. 

When I process death I am usually just numb however I have only ever processed the sudden death of my cats so I have never experienced true grief.

It’s frustrating because I want to understand my friends and engage in a relationship however I feel as though I can’t do this. It’s hard to comfort people when I don’t really get upset that often, most of the time I just feel happy which I shouldn’t be complaining about but I can’t help how I feel.

I’m scared I’m a sociopath however I don’t do things for my own gain often so I don’t think this is the case. Can anyone help?

159,"I hope this is the right place to post this. I've just been dealing with this feeling over the last few years and I'm hoping that someone out there can relate and possibly offer some advice.

I'm in my mid 33 and have been independent most of my life. I grew up in a home with no interest in discussing or improving mental health. When I was in college I had the revelation that I'd been living with major depression and anxiety disorder and opened myself up to getting help. It's the single best choice I've ever made and it's improved my quality of life.

Then there's my brother. My brother is 31 and lives with schizo-effective disorder but refuses to believe it. He was diagnosed about five years ago when his delusions led him to being arrested for disorderly conduct. That was his ""come to Jesus"" moment when he accepted he had a mental health problem that needed to be treated. At first everything was looking great, he was diligent with taking his medication, actively meeting with his therapist, and adopted a very responsible attitude regarding his health. 

Since then, though, he's been much more vocal about not needing to take his medication and being better. It even hit a point about a year ago where he stopped taking his meds for a week and ended up being arrested again, this time for trespassing. Of course, he said it was a wake up call and would get back on board with his doctor's orders but I can see he's starting to slip again. 

At that time I lived only a state over from him and my family (he still lives with our parents) but I recently moved across country for work. I'm seriously stressing how things will play out if he goes off his meds and gets into trouble again. I can't just put my life on pause to fly back and stay with him as he recovers. I'm married, just dropped a lot of money on this move, and have a new job that I can't afford to lose. I've spoken to my own therapist about this and they believe I need to consider breaking contact with him... that he's become to dependent on me coming in to fix things when he goes off his meds. Plus, the stress just drives me up the wall.

The problem I keep hitting is that if I do break contact, it's just creating more of a burden for my parents. They're in their late 60's and all I can keep thinking about is what toll this is taking on their health. Plus, I still want to keep in contact with them.

I'm finding myself in a place where I have to think with my head over my heart but my god it's difficult. Is there anyone out there that've been in similar circumstances? If you have, what happened... did things get better?
