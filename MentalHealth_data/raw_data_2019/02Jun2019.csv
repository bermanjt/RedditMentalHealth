1,"I don't remember the last time I looked forward to doing something or the last time I've been excited. 

I'm 18 &amp; live in the UK and have been trying to find work lately. My mother in law offered to give a referral for me and my bf to work in her factory. I found myself not feeling excited, despite my only issue with the job being early shifts, other than that it's completely fine and ideal for me. 

My bf was excited and really happy to hearing he could get a job but I can't help but feel indifferent. I've been like this for years and I genuinely don't remember the last time I actually wanted to do something.

I just feel 'meh'.

If it's any relevance, I'm currently going to counseling to help with negative thinking and emotional sensitivity. I haven't been diagnosed with depression however it is suspected but I'm not going to claim without knowing.

I just really want some outside perspective on this

Thank you.",02Jun2019,1

5,"Hey I apologize for posting on mobile but I don’t want to wait to ask for advice on a desktop.

My friend (22) recently within the week lost his father to cancer. I can only imagine the emotional toll it’s taking on him having to plan the funeral and everything while attending law school.
Also his gf decided to break up with him.
I called to check in on him and he was explaining to me how he felt depressed.

I’ve been doing my best to show him how he isn’t alone through all of this and I frequently check in on him.

Any advice on how I can help him cope with what’s going on? Or should I persuade him to speak with a professional?

Thank you for any advice you can send my way.",02Jun2019,1

9,"TLDR; workaholic husband won’t stop smoking weed and is miserable without it. I told him I won’t stay if he doesn’t clean up his life.

—————

I married a heroin addict who used weed to quit. His day revolves around weed. He smokes on his way to work, before bed, and uses a vape in between. When I met him he would hide weed from me or lie about buying. I made a shit show about that kind of behavior and told him to stop.  I’ve also told him he’s got to stop spending all of his money on weed and things that come with it (fast food/eating out/gas station snacks etc).

He’s struggling hard. His mother wasn’t a great example of sober/financially responsible living. He doesn’t have any hobbies and tends to shut down by forcing himself to go to sleep. It makes our household pretty miserable. Tonight he told me that he needs something to do to keep him occupied. He says he’s proud of himself when he doesn’t eat out or spend money on stupid stuff but will catch himself asking why he has to do things that don’t make him happy (save money). It’s obvious that he doesn’t have any interest in sober activities but he does it because of me. I don’t know how to help him. His lifestyle is going to keep us in poverty if he doesn’t quit. I’m tired of feeling like I’m the only one who has to grow up (pay my bills, save money, have goals, accomplish things).",02Jun2019,1
10,"I've always been unemployed since graduation 🎓 and though I apply for jobs I get nowhere so have little to no enthusiasm for repeating a process with zero expectations of result.

The thing is it means I'm alone and can't imagine being of any interest to a woman. As a man, esp unemployed, I feel of no dating value. 

I don't really have hobbies or activities though trying to find something. My days are kinda empty and I sleep a lot. I could try doing a course (education) to improve employability but no clue what and not sure it'll help me. I don't really have friends here.",02Jun2019,1

When I cant be with him im just well lets say dead inside, im sad i dont wanna do anything and i just keep thinking how i want to be with him and THEN my mind flip and all of the sudden I have these thoughts like he is probably cheating on me or he doesnt love me ... 
even when we are together like once a week or maybe twice and then the rest of the week we are not,again i am sad and i start to having these thoughts again.. amd all i can do is go through all the social media over and over again just to see if he is ignoring me or idk what. The only part of my life when i dont think that much about him is at work even though the thoughts are still there.. 
i dont even know if this is legit something or not but I know that in some way I  am losing him because of my behavior . I was diagnosed with  Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder  Adjustment  disorder and Mixed personality disorder ..  and I dont know if these can have an affect on why and how i am behaving such way..  I burst into anger so easily, I overreact  so many times and for that reason I think, we fight all the time...
I really love my bf and i dont want to lose him i could not even bare it..  what can I try to do to make it better ..?

13,"My long distance girlfriend has suffered from a complete memory wipe and she is only 21 years old. Her parents are divorced and she had physical, sexual, and mental abuse from those who were suppose to be there to love and support her. She is half way across the world in South East Asia.

She has been working 2 jobs for the past 2 weeks, 16 hour days because she wants to earn enough money to go to university and leave the country that she's in asap. She's been extremely stressed, and she has a history of migraines. Particularly recently, she was complaining about memory issues, where she can't remember various details such as how long she's been living in South East Asia, how old I am, or the fact that we had a conversation 12 hours earlier.

36 hours ago, we were texting during her evening and my morning. She just finished her second job for the day and went out with her coworkers. I was asking about her day and within 30 minutes, she told me that she doesn't remember anything, she has a headache, and and all she knows is that she loves me. Afterwards, it became clear to me that her memories were wiped clean. She knows her name, what she looks like, and her age (barely on the last one). She didn't remember who her mom was, what her interests were, or who she was hanging out with that very night. She obviously didn't remember who I was or what I looked like, but only knew that she had a warm feeling about me. She has looked at previous photos of us together, and felt happy even though I was ""a stranger"". 

Currently, she is sleeping but her headache is still there. She mentioned before bed that there was a throbbing sensation behind her left eye, and it goes to the back of her neck. My heart is shattered right now, and there isn't much I can do given my physical situation.

Has there been any cases of this? Will she regain her memory? If not, how can she proceed from here?

14,"Hello. Its my first time posting so sorry if the format is weird. I just wanna vent and kinda let loose for a bit. 

I never seen a doctor about my problems, but my social worker says I may have depression. Recently, I have random thoughts of just crying for no reason at all, and I would want to disappear. This have led me to skip school multiple times in the past few weeks. Other than these thoughts, I am usually fine but the past few days I feel like that most of the time.

I usually use energy drinks to sorta cope through it, as energy drinks really give me the energy to carry myself through the day. However, their effectiveness has been going down lately, and I just don’t know what to do anymore. The past few days, I feel like crying and disappearing more and more. Usually the feeling only last for 1/3 of a day but now it lasts for more than 2/3 of the day. As energy drinks no longer helps, I am considering trying cigarettes. The thoughts of trying cigarettes have also been on my mind during these few days.

Also, I do walks and listen to music to cope but now they just make me feel more depressed now. Not only that, I guess due to the depression I have lost my only hobby, gaming. I know I should see a therapist but my father will freak out over this and not believe me. I do not live in the states as well, so I don’t have any online services available to me. I tried talking with my best friends but they couldn’t care less. I have the whole day today alone to myself and I may go out and grab cigarettes later. I just need something really badly so I can feel normal again.",02Jun2019,0

18,"Recently I’ve been having a lot of trouble trying to relay the symptoms I feel to my family, namely my parents. I’m currently 19, and just got back from college about three weeks ago. During the last semester, I went to the school’s counseling services and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Now this was something that had been going on for a while, but extremely high tensions during the semester really pushed me to get help. For a while I met with a counselor and was put on medication, but kept it a secret from my parents. Eventually, I called them over the phone to tell them and they seemed receptive, but now that I’m home I still feel the same way and it’s affecting my relationship with them. Every time I go into a panic attack or depressive episode, they don’t understand and try to make me do things I know I can’t. For example, one morning before work I had a severe anxiety attack and I called out. Instead of support, my dad came at me with hostility for being “irresponsible” for skipping work, but the thing is he just doesn’t understand my situation. It’s very frustrating that they put on this front that they care about my health, then meet me with hostility every time I say I can’t do something or I’m not in the right state for it. Does anyone have suggestions on how I can help to relay how I feel and how that affects what I’m willing to do? They kind of treat me like a child and don’t take what I have to say seriously now that I’m actually home, and it’s really becoming an issue because I feel like a stranger in my own home.

19,"Hey guys not sure if this is the right place for this. Pretty much my entire life I get into these fits of rage every now and then (usually around the time of my period) over minuscule things. IE: if a website isn’t loading/posting something, if I mess up in a video game, things like that. 

Idk why but I get into such a rage that I start punching or scratching myself. It’s the only way I can really express my anger. I hate it. I have scars on my legs from my scratching. I have to lie and say they’re from shaving. 

I want to get help for this but I don’t even know where to start.

20,"Today I went to my first Pride Festival and for the most part, it was okay, I did love it (mainly because I got to leave the house). Though with most events I go to (which is rare), I sort of go inward, partly, anyway. I just feel alone, always. This is felt even around friends and family. I never feel truly apart of anything. I'm reminded that I'm alone and that I'll always feel this way, and the more people present, the more intense this feeling is. Doesn't matter how much I participate, this feeling is always there. 

I won't lie, it's somewhat bothersome, but for the most part, I only feel like I should be bothered by it because I think other people would say that I should. Now this could have been attributed to depression, the easiest answer, but I've never felt apart of anything even when I was a child. My childhood was was the happiest time of my life... And I've mostly fought and won over my depression. I have markedly improved since last year.

I have 19 years old and for years I've been through a wave of mistakes and problems with my mental health. When I was a child a family member sexually abused me and nobody in my family knows because I didn't want to destroy my family because I love it but this situation with the years gets really worse in my head, i start to consume drugs when I was 15 and I think that just turned out the things really worse and starts to affect me in some ways that i didn't notice because I considered it something normal, because I was an adolescent.
My question is because in this year I've been through new experiences with my mental health.
There was a time when I was good, my life was good until I start to hear voices inside my head, they told me that my life wasn't worth, that I have to kill myself and everytime that I've tried something to do about it this voices attacked me. 
After that I had some experiences with episodes of paranoia when I was walking to the university... it was pretty bad to feel it and see me in that situation put me in some kind of state that I can't get out, even if I tried to do something for me it's seems like someone destroy my efforts.
I don't know what to do, in the last weeks I left the university because I can't get up from bed and make my stuff turns an inhuman effort.

24,"18, female, of the UK

Recently I’m suffering painful night terrors a few times a month and today may have been the worst. I am conscious during these night terrors which makes them more upsetting as I am trying to wake myself up but struggling. I have work in a few hours but I’m too scared to go back to sleep so thought I’d vent. Talking about all these things is really difficult, I don’t just have friends to talk about this stuff to and deal with it mostly through humour.

There’s been a few upsetting things in my life, my mother has arthritis in her spine and has been immobile and housebound for 7 years. When I was younger she worked many jobs and also had boyfriends she would spend a lot of her time outside of work. I often feel like I’ve lost out on having a motherly figure and doing those typical mother-daughter things. I don’t have a father so I feel like this has contributed a lot to my loneliness. For many years our healthcare system has denied us disability allowance for my mother’s illness, claiming she is fit to work,though I’m well aware of this not being the case... as of this I also feel a lot of resentment over us being very poor.

In late 2017 I had my first serious boyfriend, which lasted around 7 months. The relationship ended because he ended up being physical, hitting me and treating me in generally an abusive way. After this he sent my nudes to our friends and my family, including my brother, threatened to turn up to my house randomly, he posted about me non stop on his social medias, and I ended up contacting the police in November 2018. It took until April 2019 for them to attempt arrest, which resulted in him having an interview at his police station. Questions were asked and he admitted all accusations. I feel the officer felt pity for him because all original promises about what was going to be done to him were dropped and he is writing me a letter of apology which I haven’t yet received, though he said it would have been here long ago. 

I feel like the police/justice system failed me and if my mentality was a bit weaker I might have hurt myself. My life in most aspects have improved, I am working a lot, taking my a level exams (first one on Monday, wish me luck) and going to the gym 4 times a week, I’m so busy that I fall asleep early most nights or have to nap during the day. Yet also I feel empty, doomed to fail in life. I’m very much aware my mums condition isn’t going to improve, ever. Things felt dark before and through all of the last year I just repressed my feelings related to this whole ordeal but actually I’m really upset. I don’t know why someone I didn’t do anything to would hurt me so much and then continue to make things worse for me after(whilst still begging for me to take him back). 
Mostly I’m over this now though, a few months ago it hung on my mind a lot, especially after the police officer told me he “seemed nice” and he believed he “wouldn’t do it again”, but I’m mostly at peace with it. So I don’t know why now I’ve been consistently getting awful night terrors and some invasive, nasty thoughts. Also I just wanted to vent, thank you",02Jun2019,2

26,"Hello Everyone, I'm new to this sub. I am reaching the point where I have to write what's going on with me. I have a history of mental health but not for what I think I may have. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with 'clinical depression with psychotic features'. That was in 2008. I was able to get help because I was 16 at that time and I was living with a random person that gave me housing when I needed it, however, he took advantage of me and I drank and he drugged me but one time after so much weed I had to call 911 and he got scared I think because he didn't let me call, and I begged him, I knelt down on my knees, cried to him to take me to the hospital but he wouldn't. I was having, I believe one of my earliest most severe panic attacks. I also believe that I was being slightly delusional because I remember seeing the street create a wave like the ones in the ocean. Anyway, that drove me to run from the house and go to the firefighters' department that was a block and half away to the left of the place I was staying in. That's how I first got in contact with a psychiatrist because the firefighters called the ambulance and I was taken to a mental institution. Then I got better and after years of psychiatric treatment, until 2015, I was able to get a job that pays slightly over the minimum to disqualify for MediCal but not enough to be able to afford health insurance on my own so I have to stop receiving mental health treatment. Now is 2019 and my way of thinking since childhood has gotten worse, so much that I am thinking of going back to mental health treatment.  So here is my new problem: I have always been curious and philosophically inclined but I didn't really know what philosophy really was until like 19 years old. So when I use the phone, if it isn't to call someone on facebook it is about looking up information that I don't know, it's like a sensation that there is something that I haven't found, but that 'something' is the ultimate truth. So I have changed my view on life and everything because I always look up things that contradict my beliefs and that is how I search for this 'truth that I don't know'. I do this because part of me sincerely believe that what I experience and what I have been told from birth isn't the truth and all I think about, believe it or not, at least every minute or so is this 'ultimate truth' that I do not know. So this has led me to various beliefs about reality and one them has been a Truman like world, where there are observers watching me, watching me be  a human, but this way of watching me is the same way you would watch the main player on a game where the character has no access to the camera so it's the same for me, I wouldn't be able to see the camera if I were a game character.  That isn't my only belief, I also share the following: at least once a day I believe that I have been sent to be the savior of humanity, that I am a jesus-like entity, that's going to rise to the top and free humanity from all that is evil and not good. I imagine myself screaming at top political leaders and performing miracles, being immune to bullets and other things that could destroy me. my other belief is that I am neo from the matrix, and this is the most terrifying one of all because recently I was in my room and in my room I have 3 big mirrors, in one of the mirrors I saw a glimpse of a white rabbit but when I concentrated stronger, it disappeared, then I immediately thought that I am in fact neo and that that was a clue  and also that my name Nelson which is Neo without consonants so all movies are actually telling me the truth but I haven't figured it out yet. This Neo one is stronger because now I'm starting to experience stranger reality stuff, like when I look to the floor it moves too close to my face making me feel very short but then it becomes normal. When I stare at the mirror I get this sensation that I'm going to merge into the mirror and find this truth I've been looking for. I'm scared really, I even have to get a drink to deal with that right now.  Is there medicine for this sort of thing? That would give me hope and I don't know what to do so I have to vent.

29,"Hey guys. This is a throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 16 years old I started smoking cannabis and experimenting with a few other drugs. I was fine until I started using synthetic cannabis at 18. I experienced really strange psychological effects and changes in my thoughts. It improved a few months after stopping, but I still didn't feel right. I started noticing memory issues; when falling asleep, I would have problems holding thoughts in my head. I would sometimes literally forget things instantly. Thoughts would suddenly dissapear and I wouldn't be able to remember what I was thinking about just a second or two ago. My memory is always at its worst when I'm sleepy, especially right before falling asleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also started noticing warning signs of schizophrenia. I would have disturbing dreams, hear loud noises while falling asleep, felt a pressure in my head, hearing voices (not audible, but as if I was imagining someone saying strange things) while awake, and often I had moments when my mind felt like it was on the verge of breaking). Over time the schizophrenic symptoms have gone away, but not the memory problems. I can't rememeber what I've done the day before unless I stop and think for a little while. Memories from two days before are even worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have cognitive problems and can't maintain thoughts in my head very well. For example, if I'm trying to do a maths problem with different steps, as soon as I move on to the next few steps I forget what I was doing just before and have to keep repeating to myself verbally what I'm doing. I can read a paragraph and retain barely any of it. I have to read slowly and concentrate on the words. My brain is just very slow in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, my dreams have become strange and detached and reflect my waking state of mind. They used to be so beautiful and vivid. My mind in general is duller. I'm mildly depressed. I should mention that I sometimes smoked weed through aliminium cans. I've heard that can cause problems later on. Are these symptoms an after effect from the schizophrenia, or warning signs for something worse?",02Jun2019,1
30,"Hey, so this post will probably be a mess, I apologize in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24F and I've been dealing with what I think is health anxiety since I was like 11 years old. All of my teenage years I was convinced I had lymphoma or different types of cancer. I would spend hours reading stuff on google, researching, I knew almost every symptom for the most common cancers, etc. I thought I was going to die before finishing high school, I was constantly thinking and obssesing over everything that happened to my body. I never told anyone about this, not my parents nor my friends. Then, after finishing high school all these thoughts kind of went away; I felt relieved and really good. This anxiety-free feeling continued for about a year and a half, until I started dating my now ex boyfriend. I started obsessing over my health again, thinking I was a bad person getting involved with someone even though I KNEW I was going to die soon. He was the first person I told my fears to and I now know I was so overwhelming with my feelings that they wore down our relationship, which ended about 2 years ago. I'm currently involved with someone else, who knows about my issues, and I'm really scared the same thing will happen. Due to all of this, I started therapy about a month ago, but I can't seem to tell her about my health anxiety/obsessions, I get too nervous or scared she will judge me, I don't feel comfortable at all with her, like I don't entirely trust her. I don't know if this is common, cause it's my first time going to therapy, or if I should change my therapist. I'm not sure if should keep going with her, wait a little longer or just get an appointment with another psych. So yeah, any ""tips"" on how to deal with therapy are welcomed.

In school especially, when I'm writing, if a letter or number doesn't look ""good"" I will erase over and over until it looks better.

For non-scantron tests, I don't even circle the correct answer, because I will redraw the circle until the lines don't overlap and it looks good. Instead I just cross out the wrong answers.

32,"I've tried to kill myself once (twice depending on ""what counts"") and the time I went to the hospital for it was so scary and surreal. I cut but I try to limit myself just because I don't want others to notice. I've noticed myself driving more recklessly late at night and I've started to drink a little too much just so that I don't feel anything. I'm too much of a perfectionist and an overachiever when it comes to my schoolwork and my art; I feel like no matter what I do, it's never enough. I always thought ""Once I do this, I'll be happy with myself!"" but that's not the case. 

Every time I get a therapist I will stick with it for like a month or two and then I will just quit it, because I know that if I expose myself then I will be hospitalized or something.

I recently turned 18, so I know that the confidentiality rules are different, but that a therapist can still involuntarily hospitalize me if I shared the entire truth of my mental state. This is what keeps me from getting help.

I understand that hospitalization comes from good intensions, but from my experience at least, it leaves the patient scared and dehumanized without dignity. 

I really need professional help, and I don't want to burden my friends or other people I am close to with this. But the prospect of people treating me like I'm fragile or crazy or being symbolically locked up in a hospital scares me.

So I've tried looking this up and all I've gotten was people mentioning ""loud thoughts"", and this sounds somewhat how I think of it, but how people are describing their experiences aren't exactly what I'm dealing with. 

From what I remember, this has only happened to me when I was laying in bed at night. When I start thinking and mostly if I go over it a couple of times, I sometimes feel as if I can hear someone saying my thoughts out loud. I know there isn't actually someone saying it, but that's what it feels like. I think it's actually only happened to me about 5 or 6 times.

35,"ok to start off i’m [18 f] my family has a history of poor mental health in women (such as anxiety disorders), but the big thing i want to say first is i don’t feel comfortable talking about this to anyone, and i don’t have the money or resources to seek professional help.

my problem is that i feel bad in one way or another all. of. the. time. the problem is a few things will brighten my mood, and whenever it’s dampened something happened and it’s not like my emotional distress just pops up out of no where. 

my life seems to be a viscous cycle of... something happening, i get a feeling of anger and sadness, i lash out on the people around me, and then i feel humiliated and regretful for it. i feel like it’s probably just hormones or teen stuff, but it really effects my life. it ruins my relationships, my sleep patterns, and my motivation to do anything. 

the things that set me off can be anything from, a snarky comment from a peer, to larger things like not getting a role i worked super hard on.

[trigger warning about self harm]

i used to act out on not only friends, but myself too. when i would get upset i would bang my head against things, and i would sometimes bleed from this. i would also scratch my arms until they were raw. again i have stopped myself now even though the urge has come back.  i’m afraid to talk about this because i think people will think i’m crazy and i don’t really have any scars so i’m afraid they won’t care.

it’s just that between and even surfing episodes of this i will still laugh and have a good time, so i’m not sure what’s wrong with me. 

i’m so sorry if this was too graphic or weird i just really need to talk about it and i have nowhere else to go.",02Jun2019,1
36,"I'm not sure this is the right subreddit. If there's a better one I could move my post.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Canada, and I'm kind of at the end of my rope with my sister. I'm just so exhausted. My two sisters and I are all on disability. (My middle sister and I for anxiety disorders). My youngest sister is 24, and with my mental health issues, I can no longer care for her. I just can't do it anymore. But no one else is willing to help her, and she is unwilling to help herself, and I'm so scared.

&amp;#x200B;

I will disclose the severity of her issue, but I don't mean to betray her privacy by sharing too much. She cannot count money. She can read kind of, I think at a first grade level. She has difficulty understanding concepts like consequence, and when she has done something wrong (I cannot, CANNOT make her take responsibility for something, and it wears me down most of all, because just hearing an ""Ooops, sorry"" just once would be music to my ears. But I know somewhere inside she can't help this and it's not her fault). She cannot use technology, like phones or computers, will not speak to strangers out of shyness and fear, cannot cross the road by herself, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of my family is hands-off when it comes to her. My mother takes over when she is home, but works full-time, so my sister is left to her own devices all day, and it scares me that she doesn't do anything. I mean literally nothing. Sits or wanders around. Shows no interest in hobbies of any kind. I'm so scared she will wander around in this manner in an institution one day.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have ""taken the reigns"", if you will. We are together in the house most days anyway because, as I mentioned, I'm too anxious to go out much. I figured we could help eachother. I need someone to come out with me, as it eases my feelings of anxiety. In my eyes, she needed to get out of the house. She needed to feel a part of the world, I thought. I don't know if I was wrong, if I should leave her home alone for the rest of my life. I just know this is not working out at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the issues she has that I listed above, I have to count her money for her when we go out (we usually go out for lunch). We usually have to stop at the bank first to check if she has money, because she cannot budget and spends all of her disability check well before the month is over. I have to use the bank machine for her. I have to read the menu for her at the fast food restaurant. I have to describe every item to her until she finds one she likes, even though we go there over and over. I have to prod her into telling me what is wrong, because 8 out of 10 times she is upset about something and starts sulking and I don't even know what is wrong. Usually I snapped at her at some point and she's angry. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the most difficult thing is that recently she's picked up a phobia, and it's horrible. I have plenty of them, as does my mom, as does my middle sister. But my youngest sister is afraid of chocking. Guys, she won't eat solid food. She lies to my parents, throws her dinner away when no one is looking. I have to sit with her every single evening and make sure she eats even potato chips. She's losing weight. I can't handle it, I'm panicking. I'm not a caregiver, not even to myself, I want more for her. I want her to enjoy things, to have hobbies, to maybe even try having a job one day or friends outside the house or a relationship. God, I'd settle for her learning to count 5 dollars. I want so much for her.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's like my parents don't care. They refuse to enforce when I tell her she HAS to eat, she has to try things on her own. They tell me just do it for her or leave her home. It feels like abandonment, but I'm close to just letting her be. I'm worried what will happen to her when my parents die.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry that was long. I just want to know if there are any resources available for adults who can't do very much because of mental challenges and need to learn? Or something I can do about her eating issues?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",02Jun2019,1
37,"Does it make sense to have a longing for worse than what I have?

38,"I don’t really know where else to post this so some background I guess but I’m [18f] currently struggling with an eating disorder. I go between fasting/restricting and binging and stuff. I hate the way I look and hate the number on my scale and whatever. I know that I’m not overweight but I’m not skinny either. 

So my best friend is really petite. Her body type is exactly how I want mine to be. I know I’ll probably never be that way just because I’m like 6-7 inches taller than her and wider and whatever. Every time I see her (we see each other briefly at least 5-7 times a week and hang out probably 5-6 times a week as well) I get triggered. I end up feeling worse about myself which either pushes me to fast for several days or end up binging on like 3-4 thousand calories. 

I don’t want her to know the extent of my ed because it’s really embarrassing for me. I had drunkenly mentioned it but I never named it. She hasn’t blatantly mentioned the fact that I told her but ever since that night not only her but also my boss and family have started to force me to eat more. 

The thing is is I don’t really want to get help for the Ed which I know sounds horrible and then the fact that I’m posting here too. I just don’t know how to get around the fact that I’m almost beginning to resent my best friend because of the way she looks.

40,"Just to start before anyone assumes, suggests, or asks: I have a history with low form Asperger's syndrome and/or ADD, clinical depression, and being mostly introverted. I have no history of any serious mental health issues in the sense that they're dangerous, debilitating, or harmful to my brain. I have never been tested for schizophrenia but I don't have any auditory or visual hallucinations either.

I've been doing this since I was a child. It actually began as I recall it when I started having these mental episodes convincing myself that I was telepathically communicating with my dog and cat, and they could read my mind. It was innocent but it did kinda help me keep dirty thouguts out of my head bc I was always afraid my dog would judge me.

I'm extremely introspective and have a habit of talking to myself, but many times this is not the case. I'll speak as if I'm talking to another person, and I'll make pauses in dialogue where I sort of pretend to have been asked a question or told something, and then i'll respond to it. But the thing is I never actually hear anything when I make those pauses, so it's like I'm responding to someone who is not there but even if they were there, they didn't say anything anyways.

This started to become very weird to me in my late teenage years like 17-19 years old, bc being that I'm very creative and sort of intellectually inclined I tend to pull all-nighters that consist of me doing something art related or idea related, like taking notes, reading, etc. And there will be times where I'd stop and do that talking to myself thing, but instead of just that I look off to the side of me like I'm facing a person sitting with me, and I'll have a conversation this way.

I do this most often when I'm thinking of future scenarios. Like what a person might talk to me about 5 years from now in the event that I do or become X,Y,Z. So what I'm saying is, i'll be speaking not as myself technically, but as my potential future self. I'm an extremely visionary person and this sometimes makes me do simple stuff like day dream a lot or get excited and anxious thinking about what the future could hold for me, but sometimes it's just those odd conversations.

I also do this inside of my head where I speak to, or I am spoken to by, visions of some other person. Could be now or in the future. But it will be as if a day dream I'm having is real, and they are speaking directly to me. The thing is, I'll always subconsciously understand that this person is simply a vessel to communicate my own thoughts to me when I'm having a hard time hearing them.

For example, the reason I made this post, I just had a day dream of some random guy speaking to me asking what was wrong (bc lately irl I've been extremely depressed, worse than I've ever felt). I told him I was sad and he went on some motivational speech/ranting monologue about all these positives things I had to remember and how those things, while I don't believe it, will help me in the long run.

Idk. It feels like these voices are not mine. And I have never been tested for multiple personalities, nor have I ever exhibited signs of it (unless this is one of them). But then again, it feels like these are my own thoughts. So in a sense, like when I'm having that dialoge where I physically turn my body to speak to someone who is not there, I'm talking to myself in 3rd person, and then talking back as if I'm split in 2.

42," 

'm looking for advice on my mental health. I have diagnosed depression, and undiagnosed anxiety, in addition to low self-esteem. Those are the things I'm sure of. After that, it gets very strange and complicated.

I had a rough childhood, involving a custody battle between my drug-addicted mother and my religious zealot father. I spent the vast majority of my childhood with my father. He believed strongly in corporal discipline, and I would be spanked with a wooden stick or belt on a daily basis for anything I did wrong. I remember being spanked three times in 10 minutes when I was 5 or 6, because I couldn't remember where my dad told me to put my laundry, and he kept spanking me until I eventually guessed correctly. This is one of maybe 5 or 6 memories I have of my childhood before 12. The rest of the memories are all punishments besides a memory of 9/11. I used to trip and rip my pants during recess occasionally. Whenever I did it, my dad would iron hideous, ugly looking patches onto them so that other kids would make fun of me and I'd stop tripping and ripping my pants. One time, after lying to him about something, he pinned a sign that said ""liar"" to my shirt and made me go to school with it on. This is nothing compared to the codependent relationship that existed. My dad believed that everything must be subject to God. There was nothing more important than the Bible and God. He truly believed it, too. Part and parcel of this was that ""obedience to your father is obedience to God."" Of course, this is the perfect storm for narcissistic parenting. My dad was always right, I was always wrong. My dad always knew what was best, and it was my duty to obey. Every ounce of personal motivation and will was beaten and lectured out of me.

During second grade, my dad remarried and they decided to homeschool me. His wife adopted me, and I consider her my mother. However, she had a lot of issues, too, being a belligerent, passive-aggressive perfectionist. She's probably the opposite of what the ideal qualities of a teacher would be. So, in addition to dad's religious impositions, I also had someone punishing me for scoring less than 95 on not just test, but day to day assignments. During this time, I became socially isolated, due to low self esteem and self-consciousness. Eventually, my parents gave up trying to socialize me with other kids, and enrolled me in a Classical Christian private online school. It's around this time that they started to realize how terrible their parenting had been in the past, and gradually transitioned into a gentler, more normal approach, especially as my Dad grew out of the particular sect of Christianity he belonged to. If they raised a child today, they'd be uptight parents, but definitely not abusive. This is why I harbor little resentment towards them, which seems rare among Redditors with abusive parents.

I don't want to get too hung up on history, but it's important to have an idea of where I'm coming from, I think, if you want to help me understand what's wrong with my brain (and I appreciate it, if you do).

My issues began in earnest during the Summer after my junior year. My only escape used to be video games, since I had little interaction with people outside of Church and an extracurricular activity once a week. My one friend who I knew since I was 4 lived thousands of miles away and we could only communicate through the internet. However, I began to be unable to play video games anymore. I would sit down, try to play something, and I'd just turn it off after 15 minutes. I used to spend hours upon hours playing games, and all of a sudden, it dried up. Cue textbook depression-- I began to lose interest in literally everything. Finally, a few weeks ago, after years of this gradual decline, I lost the ability to distract myself in any way besides browsing Reddit. I can't even watch YouTube videos. I get home from work and, although my conscious mind wants to enjoy something and relax, my subconscious mind overrides it and just tells me to go to bed.

The only reason I am not homeless is because of my anxiety, which is mainly directed towards whoever the ""parent figure"" in my life is. If my anxiety does not force me to do something, I don't do it. In this case, I'm living with my grandmother, so the only things I do are things that will keep her happy like working, cleaning my room, and saving money. I would not be doing any of those things if my anxiety about disappointing my parent figure didn't exist.

My self-consciousness is very odd, because it can be very selective. I am very self-conscious about my looks, smell, confidence, and whether people like me, but have no problem bellowing out songs at work with people I don't know around or being weird generally (like launching into tangents about esoteric theological topics if my coworker makes an offhand remark somewhat related). Generally, I try to keep that weirdness in check, but I can't help myself sometimes.

However, a little while ago, I noticed a pattern in my behavior. While I would be depressed and utterly useless 95% of the time, once every one or two months, there would be a week or two where I would suddenly get motivation and get things done that advanced my life, like getting a new job, being extremely productive, etc. I found this really odd for a few reasons: 1) my depression just seemed to go away or greatly lessen for a little bit, and then always come back later and 2) this happened on a regular, cyclical basis.

This prompted me to investigate Bipolar Disorder. I was struck by how well it described me, but held some reservations, since my ""hypomanic episodes,"" don't seem as extreme as people with BP2, who report hyperactivity and euphoria. Additionally, some of the hypomanic features seem to be present in my life all the time, such as being easily angered and flight of thought. At this point, I have no idea.

At this point, I'm going to list some weird behaviors I've noticed in myself, and see if perhaps it might clue some of you in to what's actually going on in my head. I engage in vivid fantasies constantly, usually involving me being a politican, rock star, or religious leader. This goes beyond ""pretending you're performing the song you're listening to in front of thousands of people"" and goes to the point where I'll have long conversations with myself, and sometimes spend a half an hour in front of the mirror staring at myself and making different faces in relation to the fantasy I'm acting out.

If I feel any kind of strong emotion, such as anger or joy, I involuntarily wave my arms around and bob my head around. This doesn't happen all the time, and I can usually control it around people, but when I'm by myself, I'll be flopping away.

I am incredibly empathetic towards people in real life, to a fault. I cannot direct anger directly at a person, and it's not because I'm scared, it's because I feel too bad. In one of the rare cases where I got angry and started screaming at my parents it was a really bizarre experience where I would curse them for a few seconds then immediately switch to apologizing and saying I didn't mean it then go right back again in the course of literally seconds. However, because I am so empathetic in real life, I brim with hatred and anger towards little, day to day annoyances, or huge, abstract political or sociological issues. The only times I've screamed, yelled, or felt intense anger at anyone IRL besides my parents was at political rallies.

I have insane amounts of doubt about everything. It goes beyond low self-esteem. I have 0 clue who I am, how I feel, or what I think. I doubt literally everything, from whether I actually like a certain food to what emotion I'm feeling at the time.

Anyway, that's all I have to say. I'm going to the doctor in a few weeks, but, really, I just want you guys to help shed some light on what might be going on. My doubt completely prevents me from understanding or even knowing what exactly is going on my head. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and good luck.",02Jun2019,1
43,"Ive been taking it for a bit and it's worked wonders, with the exception of something that started happening a few weeks ago. It's damn near impossible to fully describe, so I'll try my best. 

As I'm falling asleep I enter a dream like state, sortof a hallucination sort of not. My head gets fuzzy and starts to run, and all my visuallizations become more vivid (like, if I'm trying to tell myself a story, I imagine the frames more clearly). Like a migraine maybe, just a weird headache. Sometimes I get a rush of images to my head, like a hallucination inside the brain (Idk how else to describe it). Sometimes I'll see shifts in lighting that are impossible, etc. I tend to have nightmares or very vivid dreams when this happens. If i eat something it tends to go away or at least lesson in intensity.

Melatonin makes it worse so I stopped taking it. I was wondering if anyone's  experienced something similar, with this or any other medication. My psychiatrist was confused but my therapist said he's heard of similar stuff with other medications and patients.

45,"I'm not really sure how to make a reddit post, but I really need help and I've always thought of this platform as being a really helpful tool for receiving feedback.

I have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety disorder since I was 14 (20 now) and I've coped and worked around it to the best of my ability. I've visited multiple therapists, taken every drug under the rainbow and participated in intensive out patient programs following hospitalizations. I still have the same problems, and if anything they've worsened since I've aged and become more ""independent"".

My biggest issue and what brings and the most debilitation is my inability to communicate with people. It varies depending on how I'm feeling that day but generally my limbs go weak/shaky and it's hard to operate, I start crying and from then on the longer the conversation lasts the more I exponentially lose control over myself. I have trouble breathing and articulating myself and it makes it difficult to complete thoughts. This makes finding a job and a place to live very difficult, as after a few failures I started putting disclaimers on my applications and since then haven't been receiving any responses. Frankly, I don't see myself successfully working *any* job, I'm just not confident in myself.

It's also very damaging to my self esteem. I'm afraid I'll never be able to live completely independently and have a comfortable social life. I feel out of it, like I'm crazy. The way I act and the way I think. I feel terrible all the time and I'm tired of it and I get really frustrated that there's nothing I can do about it on my own. I just tell myself it's just a feeling and it will pass but recently it's been very persistent and hard to live with.

Currently my family is supporting me financially but I'm really uncomfortable with it, as they don't seem to fully understand my condition (or to the extent that it affects me). I feel like they're tired of my problems and the fact that I'm constantly having issues living by myself, or are fully aware of it and tired of helping me (I'm more inclined to believe the latter, but I generally have a pessimistic outlook on things).

I have no long term plans and I have no idea what to do. I have to move at the end of the month and it's just a constant timer ticking in my head and I can't find any solutions to the problems listed previously, and the closer I get to that date the crazier the thoughts get in my head. I'm having a rough time sleeping and eating, and I just feel like giving up lately. 

Currently, I'm considering putting all my belongings in storage and just going to a hospital and hoping they can help me. I really don't know what else to do. I don't want to be a burden on my family anymore, I really don't want anything but to feel better and live life like everyone else. I can't take care of myself.

46,"I´m a 17yr old female from northern Europe. I´ve been depressed since losing my father to alcoholism at age 14. I have no one to talk to, and have been feeling this way for a very long time. I decided to get help about 6 months ago and went to a good private clinic, and they gave me Prosac. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used Prosac for 4 months at various doses and finally decided this wasn´t helping me, so I wanted to switch meds. This became very hard because my cunt therapist has literally been avoiding my messages, and I can´t get meds elsewhere bc other docs say that meds should be handled by only one person. 

&amp;#x200B;

After trying to contact my psychiatrist and failing, I bought Zoloft in Russia without a prescription and (very responsibly)  tapered off of Prosac and started Zoloft at a low dose, and increased slowly. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this has made me feel like an awful person, and borderline suicidal. My brother is not really interested in having a relationship with me because he has his own life. My mother is also an alcoholic but still works, and really does not have time to deal with me. I homeschooled myself since age 12bc I really like learning, and felt that the pace at school was way too slow. This has led to me not having any friends. I also tried joining a political party as well as some athletic hobbies to find friends, but failed at that too.

I can´t for the life of me figure out why I put people off. I´m normal looking, have a good sense of humour, am very interested in politics and economics, and generally very helpful. What in the actual fuck is wrong with me?

I don't think im depressed but it still bothers me, kinda like a little rock on your shoe, that whenever i feel like i accomplish something, someone more attractive, intelligent, fit than me comes around the corner and makes me feel worthless.

49,"After having a bit of an identity crisis I stumbled across a thread about how BPD is stigmatized by a lot of mental health professionals and it is very hard to treat. I've known for about a year now that my girlfriend who I've been with since I was fourteen years old has BPD (I'm now nineteen.) I'm having several realizations.

1. I'm probably behaviorally conditioned to behave in relationships in a very niche and unhealthy way
2. I'm incredibly codependent because the entirety of my adolescence was spent in a relationship that was centered around abandonment issues
3. I want to be single for once and learn who I am as a person
4. I'm incredibly scared to leave my girlfriend who I love very much, because of her disorder.
5. I'm incredibly scared to be alone. I'm fairly certain my already precarious mental health will become substantially worse if I do that.
6. I have no idea what to do or where to start. 

I want to do something but when I even think of doing anything that could remotely change my little bubble of comfort I receive a generous dose of paralyzing fear. I live in the U.S., and currently go to college. I was previously diagnosed with adjustment disorder and I have a feeling that if a make a change this big that I'll just drop dead, that's the only way I can describe it. There's no way I could be successful in school anyway. Any advice would be very helpful.",02Jun2019,1
50,"I’m not sure if this is right for this sub but I’ll give it a go anyway 

Okay so to start off I am terrible when it comes to overthinking, small events in my life that shouldn’t be a big deal end up being blown out of proportion because I can’t help but critically overthink the situation and how it’s going to take affect. I’d love to be able to just forget about things but instead I spend hours overthinking recent events and it is really having a toll on my mental well being and relationships. It’s reached a point where I overthink so much I find it easier to avoid people because I’ve basically ruined my friendship with them in my own headspace.

All advice is greatly appreciated, Cheers.",02Jun2019,70
51,"Hey, so basically a friend of mine hates it when someone throws up and while I don‘t find it nice to watch as well, I always thought she is overreacting.
She also mentioned a few times that she literally feels really anxious and becomes panic when she sees someone vomiting.

52,"Hey, 

I think I have a problem. I am incapable to feel most of the emotions. The only feeling I have is anger which I obviously don’t express as I don’t want my coworkers or friends to know that. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar because sometimes I can just party everyday and splash a lot of money and sometimes I just feel apathetic and don’t care about socialising or whatever. 

My father died couple of years ago and I didn’t really feel sad about that. I barely feel empathy towards humans, however, I am very empathetic towards animals.

54,"It’s been a long road. 

School counsellors throughout childhood, a bad intrusive thought incident at 14 leading to an OCD diagnosis, a period of unshakeable depression and no self esteem after a series of events at the beginning of young adulthood and which hasn’t been truly resolved in the 8 years since despite multiple counselling and CBT attempts... I’ve always struggled with friendship, belonging, change, understanding myself, having true perspective, maintaining any sense of positivity. 

I can’t think of what else to do anymore. Every waking moment requires so much foresight, presence, energy to combat. I wake up already with a song on loop in my head and the automatic thoughts churning away before I even fully come to. I can’t talk to anyone anymore because it’s always the same thing and I know I’m difficult and stubborn due to the way I see and experience life. I can’t say that I am able to keep many people around me anyway as I’ve never been good at making or maintaining friendships, let alone when I’m a broken record off on my own planet not doing things expected of a 27f. I’m seeking an ASD assessment to maybe explain that after finding some interesting resources on features of women for which I identify with quite a few. I do know the ASD / OCD axis is quite interlinked in many aspects though so I don’t know what to think anymore. 

There are times spent lingering in suicidal ideation when I’m really low and stressed. It’s not that I want to attempt because I’m scared of death and dying, but it’s hard to avoid that as at least one conclusion to all of this. It’s the result of awareness that I don’t know how I can change, despite trying and wanting to. 

I want connection and meaningful relationships but I look at my life and I am not built for that in the same way as others are. I used to enjoy solitude but as an adult it doesn’t work in the same way due to the pressures and expectations, particularly in the age of networks and social media defining and quantifying your social standing and even ability to manifest financial and career achievements. I frustrate myself. I want friends but don’t want to be around most people. I’m too black and white for my own good but I refuse to compromise because it always feels so forced and fake. 

So I don’t know where I stand in this crossroads. I don’t see how I’ll ever fit into what you’re supposed to be as a happy human being. I don’t have the energy anymore. I think my thought patterns are too pervasive to change. I am alone and at a loss.

55,"Hey, I'm new to this subreddit so please tell me if this is inappropriate to post here and tell me the right place to do so!

Around eight months ago, my mental health has been the worst it's ever been. I slowly got better in 2019 and even though I obviously still struggled sometimes, I've felt more and more myself again.

But now everything starts to get worse again. I turned 18 recently and I am graduating high school rn, meaning I will have to do a lot of adult stuff now, like applying to unis, looking for a flat, and just generally getting my life together. But I just feel so lost in all of this. I know this is very common for teens but I just don't know what to do anymore. Everytgomg is coming back to me, I notice how I feel more hopeless, insecure, and anxious with every day and I'm terrified that I will be so depressed again I can't leave my room, especially since I have so much to do take care of atm. I also fear that my eating disorder will get worse again, some symptoms have already worsened over the last few weeks (nothing too bad yet, don't worry).

I'm already seeing a therapist, though since I've been better the appointments are pretty irregular and the next one is two months away, and that's only together with my parents, something I'm terrified for, but that's for another day. I also take plant based antidepressants. Other things I've tried/am still trying to improve my mental health are journaling, which I do pretty regularly and it helps me a lot, excercise, whixh is a difficult thing because of my eating disorder, and just generally trying to do more relaxing and 'self care' things, things just for me, but that's hard.

My question is, what are other things I could do to just generally improve my mental health? What helps you with stuff like this? I just feel like I really need it rn if I don't wanna fall down a hole again but I just don't know what to do anymore.",02Jun2019,3
56,"I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression disorders and it turns out that I had them for years without even realising. This has been has a huge shock to me as my cognitive processes were/are so fucked up from years of being left untreated. I recently started on a course of sertraline 50mg and its been about a week and I've had a strong reaction to the drug. My mood is already more stable and my thoughts are more controllable, but the side effects are horrible. I still have major anxiety when I go out which leaves me feeling disconnected from my surroundings, but my depressed thoughts are lifting. 

It feels extremely strange starting to feel 'normal' again but I can't help but think about all the choices i've made in the past few years that have been influenced by my mental illness.

The reason I've been taking my medication, for my Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder ""BPD"" and going to therapy twice a week, was all for them! because I love them so much! I've had CPS involved who have said ""Although I've mental health issues, they can see my children are well taken care by myself"" and decided they didn't need to be involved with me! Which is fantastic, having Mental Illness doesn't mean you cant be a good parent, clearly I'm proof of that, when I'm unstable, I make sure I stay at my parents for a few weeks, to avoid the children seeing me in that state, but thankfully it's been a long time since I've been unstable, a very long time. Medication increases and therapy ""DBT/CBT"" really has helped me, although it took years for me to agree to such intrusive therapy! I'm glad I decided to agree to it...
HOWEVER, just lately, I've been having extreme suicidal thoughts again, so extreme that I've practised ""hanging"" and now think I've got or down to a T, and even thought I've done all that, I DONT WANT TO DIE, but I also don't know how to live with these mental health illnesses I have, it's draining! even more so because I'm doing EVERYTHING to make sure my children dont notice!

62,"So a member of my family was almost diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia. She took herself into hospital and was treated. She left after a few months with the doctors saying they were considering diagnosing her. I wasn't the one dealing with the doctors so I don't know how or why the decision was made not to. But this was a few years ago and she has been out of hospital since. But there are still very clear signs that there is something wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to ask what there is I can do to help. Whenever I bring up the subject of getting help she gets angry and defensive as if there is nothing wrong. Then I get accused of ""planning"" something or trying to do something bad. It can turn nasty very quickly to the point where I'm scared to even bring it up. But I really want her to get help before something bad happens. I'm also extremely concerned about her physical health. After her time in hospital she seems to have a dislike for doctors and wont go and see one.

But it's kinda weird and difficult to put into words, the way I feel about everything now. It's like... when I was younger, say 12 to 18, it felt like absolute despair, I didn't know who to talk to and I didn't see any other solution that not being alive anymore. Stangely enough, once I entered adulthood, I've become awfully aware of these things and now it's like... just looming over, forever. I ""want"" to be dead, but I don't want die?

70,"What I mean to describe is the woman as a partner or significant other. Well, it does not affect having a normal interaction with every people. I still linger with women and have some fun with them, but I cannot imagine having a romantic relationship with any of them. 

I grew up in a normal family (my parents are a loyal couple). Hearing romantic tales in some fantasy worlds planted the idea in my mind that people are destined to one another. I lived with that mentality until a neighbor of mine was exposed for having an affair.

 It got me curious and made myself explore and learn how dark this is. I even hated celebrities since then and I lost my interest watching tv and idolizing actresses with scandal scoops presented by the media. Indulging myself (a very stupid idea) with affair stories (be it a fiction or real) completely destroyed the idea that a man and a woman can stay with only each other in satisfaction. Worse, I even developed a fetish in reading\[adult books/ comic\] and watching\[p\*rn\] some individuals having affair while their SO is ignorant about it. Now, I am trying to distance myself to my friend as the idea of me having 'fun' with their gf's is playing in my head and I can't keep my eyes from wandering to their bodies. 

Now, I loved hearing/watching people have affair with each other (or even share their gf to another man / threes\*me), but I do not REALLY want it happen to me. The problem is, how can I even be in a relationship with this idea of mine toward women. I know that there are still a lot of women who are honest and the deceptive ones may not even amount to 1% of women's total population, but I just really can't. All of this began when I was 10 and now that I'm already 17, I still do not have my first gf. I might even die without experiencing the pleasure, but I think it is better than marrying someone with a 'used p\*ssy'. \[I do not mean to offend anyone, but it is totally hopeless and the only way for me to marry someone is the thinking of whether you bleed \[defloration\] during our first night and only then I will consider you\].

82,"So I'm female, 20, and my mom is 43 and has been divorced since I was 2. She has been in a couple of relationships ever since, and it's always been so so difficult for me do deal with it. Even as a child, I was always extremely rude to her boyfriends and felt an immense hate towards them, despite the fact that my mom always assured me that I'd always come first and that she would never ever leave me. My mom always gave me plenty of attention and always told me she loves me. I don't have any siblings so it's always been just me and her. She never got to marry or live with any of her boyfriends, and there was just one relationship that lasted more than two years (I was around 8-10 when she was in that relationship). I had always been aware that I was being rude to her boyfriends and we talked about this many many times but I never got to control myself. We always thought that as I got older this behavior would subside, but it stayed exactly the same. 

My mom mentioned having met a guy a couple weeks ago and was very vague about it (nowadays she never talks about these things because she knows I'll freak out) and I know she went in a couple of dates with him in the previous weeks. Last night she left around 9 pm and I thought she went to a bar with her friends or something, as she sometimes does on Saturdays. But this morning I woke up and she wasn't home. At first I thought she had gone somewhere before I woke up but about 30 minutes ago she texted me saying she was coming home soon. I asked her where she was and she was a little vague about it but told me she spent the night with the guy. 

I didn't care much about it when she told me she met someone, neither when she went on dates, but now that she spent the night out I'm feeling all kinds of things. I'm so so angry and upset, my hands are shaking and my heart is pounding and it's taking every fiber of my being not to self harm right now. She's coming home soon and I feel an intense urge to scream at her and call her a whore and be mean and make her cry. I'm not gonna do that though, what usually ends up happening is me mostly ignoring her and being a little rude. I don't want to hurt her feelings, I don't want her to feel bad, and I don't think she's a whore. I think she has the right to meet people and she has the right to be happy and do whatever she wants, but what my thoughts say and what my feelings say are two complete opposite things. 

I don't understand why I feel like this, and just to be clear, it has nothing to do with my father. I don't wish they would still be together or that she should be faithful to him or anything. I also don't think her boyfriend would replace me and I don't have any concerns she would leave me for him or give me less attention. I'm pretty sure I don't have fear of abandonment as no family member ever left or threatened to leave me and I'm not scared about the thought of that happening. 

Although, I think I should mention I'm diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and one major characteristic is indeed fear of abandonment. But I genuinely never thought much about it or felt scared of the thought of being left. In fact, I had multiple friends and one best friend who started completely ignoring and ghosting me all of a sudden, and I was little sad of course, but overall didn't care. I felt like ""if they don't care about me, well, I don't care about them either"". I take medication for BPD and have been going to therapy since I was 11, but there are certain subjects I just can't talk about. This thing of being possessive of my mom is one of them, I just cannot bring myself to say that out loud. I've been with my current therapist for about 4 years now and I have an extremely hard time talking to her, not because I don't trust her or don't feel a bond, but because every single time I just don't want to talk, and the more she tries to talk to me the more stubborn I feel and the more effort I make to not talk at all, so, telling me to discuss this with my therapist won't help me. 

Even if no one replies I think I just needed to write down how I'm feeling and try to distract myself to keep me from not self harming. I've been one month clean and I really don't want to hurt myself anymore. 
If you ever experienced something similar, do you have any advice on how to deal with this? Is there anything I can do to cope with these feelings other than talking to someone about it? 

I appreciate you reading all of this, and if I forgot some information that would be important, just let me know!",02Jun2019,5
83,"Where do I start. I can explain to people online no problem as it’s not face to face. But in person I can’t. I don’t have any official diagnosis but I’m 99% certain I have anxiety. When I was a child I lived in the middle of nowhere with no neighbours or friends. When I went to secondary school, I had to have 3/4 years off for hospital and operation and recovery, being in ITU for three weeks being awake and unable to take. Then recovering at home no no friends. Once I was back as school, I never really clicked with any group so kept myself to myself.

I also have a facial disfigurement which attracts a lot of attention meaning I try and not go out anywhere as I hate the stares. (I’ve been asked if it’s contagious, called the hulk, asked to leave a shop my another customer as I was scaring her 18 years daughter(who was off to uni I discovered when the daughter apologised for her mother) I will add one of the nicest experience I’ve had was a clothes shop in Glasgow where I was treated as normal which I never get this was one cool young uni student serving it was so nice I’ve never had service like it before or since.

I can’t talk to people easily, and I don’t know how to keep conversations going or start them, with all the issues with school means I don’t have any “friends” offline. Well one but not one I can trust enough to share this without the risk of them thinking I’m crazy (maybe not the best term) and then spreading it around everywhere, also never having a relationship/girlfriend has not helped at all.

With work I have to talk customers everyday who don’t know how to use computers.

Today we send an invoice for some work a few days ago (paid on the day) we sent this for their records and now they are saying they had no work done and why am I sending it, quick talk to them and they say oh we did.

Another asked for a copy of an invoice I send it they delete it when get made I have not sent it and I send proof it’s being send and delete and they can’t give a reason why and still scream I have not sent it.

I have a few health issues kyphoscoliosis and neurofibromatosis no one understand the latter one those with it do but apart from that I can explain it in words with the NF I have a large growth (plexiform official term) on my face which is full of blood vessels and can get very hot for no reason which is when my temper and mood changes.

I have lost all interest in work over the past few weeks and months.

There are some days I just want to hide away and cry and what my life has become.

I have been living with this for years and know I’m getting worse I just don’t know where to go from here.

I know I need to see my doctor but I just feel I can’t talk face to face about this but semi-anon online no problem at all.",02Jun2019,1
84,"Sooo...I've been going out with a guy just over a year and life has been good. We have the occasional dumb fight but I really love him a lot. 

The thing is, before I was dating him, I had a very healthy body image. I did think my boobs could be a bit bigger but I thought my legs were good enough, my butt was good enough, and my waist was good enough, to me and my standards anyway. 

But after I started dating, i got exposed via my boyfriend to these meme pages on Instagram, you know, with over a million followers and they post some dank as hell memes, but they also post ads about other accounts and stuff. They started posting pictures of these girls in bikinis with seriously unrealistic proportions, tiny waist, and huge butt and boobs, and gorgeously airbrushed faces. 

It never bothered me when I saw like...magazine ads of girls who look this way but maybe because I see them scrolling past my feed daily, these Instagram posts make me feel inadequate and as if these things are telling me you should look this way, why dont you?

My boyfriend is very supportive and has never told me that I need to lose weight or gain weight anywhere, but when I see that he liked pictures of fitness girls, or girls in bikinis, I think he does it because he secretly wants me to look that way, or that he would pick a girl who looks like that over me if the opportunity presented itself. 

And you would think if I trust the guy I wouldn't think that he would just drop me like a sack of potatoes and run off with some sexy bikini model at a moments notice, but other small things about trust I really have some personal problems with.

Like theres this girl he used to be friends with that he used to have a crush on. She extorted some money out of him, she was wreaking havoc on our relationship so now they dont talk. Anyways, I found out a few months ago shes a pisces, in the zodiac. Ever since then, every time I see the word pisces in those Instagram horoscope posts, I check it and see what kind of...pizza she would be or something stupid like that, and when i see her and my boyfriend in the same kind of category for horoscopes, I get irked. 

I'm insane I know, but I have this unhealthy obsession about her, like...her influence still lingers and I want to not care about her or her zodiac sign but if I'm being honest, I get kinda paranoid about any female my boyfriend mentions, and it didnt used to be like this, really...I just need some help

88,"So, as in the title, I am pretty sure he has ADD, it is not conformed though, but he already has made a appointment with a clinical psychologist but not before next month. 
I am myself a student of psychology and by now means able do diagnose him nor really help him (yet). He just struggles so much right now with work, because he can´t focus or even start because he gets distracted. I already noticed this behavior before in daily activities, like cleaning or chores. I also saw a note from his old teacher, that said that he was unfocused and hyperaktive at school. With that said I just wanted to give you some clearance about what the issue is. 
My actual question is how can I help him, til he goes to the psychologist? Maybe some people here want to share some tricks and tips how they manage their daily life with an attention disorder. I just see him struggle so much right know and it breaks my heart that I can not help him.

2nd event - Got traumatized over cockroach movie, which is supposed to be funny but got the wrong scary cockroach movie. And, I’m still afraid of cockroaches. I can’t stand within 10 feet of cockroach.

3rd event - Our family business caught fire and all that’s left is ashes.

92,"TL;DR: I was bullied in highschool intensely. New therapist thinks it's trauma and I think she's right.

So basically all through high school I was relentlessly bullied by people I thought of as friends. They would constantly put me down and tell me to kill myself or make fun of me for being gay. My brother (who was also in this group) always told me to laugh it off because ""it's just a joke. Why can't you take a joke?"", Despite the fact I repeatedly asked them to stop. I felt like I couldn't leave them because they were my friends and I wouldn't be able to make new friends.

Fast forward to now, 2 years after graduating and I've cut them out of my lives ( although I can't avoid them because my brother still hangs out with them) and I go to an intake appointment for a new therapist. We go through the usual questions about drugs and diagnoses, and then she asked if I'd ever experienced trauma. Of course I said no, because I've always justified the bullying, but I ended up mentioning it as an after thought. And she told me that it sounded like trauma. 

I always thought trauma was for people with more ""serious"" issues but I think she's right. This bullying has basically defined how I view relationships now. I feel I have to prove myself worthy of them because I wasn't worth anything to my bullies. I feel like I have to test my friends to see if they really love me because in highschool my ""friends"" did not.

Since I was little I hanged out more with girls than with boys, I don't know I couldn't talk to them or form any kind of bond.

Every single of them did something that shouldn't be done. Cheating, lying, stealing, false accusations, playing with guys to get free stuff. 

Even the depressed, anxious, shyiest and sweetest one is a shit bag. 

One of those was calling a friend of mine (male) an abuser behind his back to other people. In a group chat those people started to call him that and I went to talk to him. He talked to her, she denied everything. 
He got into the group, she accepted that she had done it and told him that she said it in a private conversation and I shouldn't have said it to other people, also that it was out of context.

Everyone defended her because you shouldn't.say what other people say to you even if you know that those are lies. 

I got kicked from the group. I got ""cancelled"" and someone made a post about how I'm a bad person and a manipulator. Half of my friendlist vanished that day.

102,"Hey all, 
So I’m sitting in my living room this morning struggling a bit with my thoughts. I do this often on my days off- when I’m not working, I wake up empty and with no motivation. Some days are better than others, I’d say it’s 50/50. Sometimes,  I feel good and happy and confident and I walk my dog, I clean my house. I call friends to see if they want to hang out. Sometimes, it’s a mixture during the day. One part is really good and then I start overthinking and I destroy the happy feeling. I end up sitting on my phone scrolling mindlessly. I start juggling thoughts of how I’m not good enough to be where I want to be in life, or that my confidence is narcissistic and I’ll hurt people. A big factor of this is because got out of a terrible complicated  relationship that will take so long to explain. In a sort of short explanation, it was with 2 people, one a boyfriend and one a best friend who basically made me feel like and still believe that I am scum on earth. I had been friends with this girl, then I met this boy and although we would hang out all the time the 3 of us, my friend became jealous. Ended up admitting deeper feelings for me. Boyfriend ended up going to prison (was not the “type” and pretty unexpected, we were all around the age 18-21) and she moved away. A few weeks after she moved away, I didn’t really talk with her as we were having some issues of jealousy in the past. She messaged me, saying terrible things about my personality and calling me names, calling me a narcissist for posting on Snapchat and not talking to her, bashing my whole sense of being basically. I remember not retaliating similarly but trying to work it out logically. At that same time, I had a boyfriend in prison who I thought I was in love with who I’d made promises to before I knew the weight of being in a relationship like so. She knew his distress, and since he and I were so sad she offered to talk to him on the phone and write to him in a more positive position so I gave him her phone number. I ended up cheating on him, left him, and went through a dark lonely period of partying and making mistakes. So, both of these people carry resentment towards me (him way more rightfully than her in my opinion) and then feeding that to each other I think. When he was released after a year in the halfway house, we both agreed to try again (bad idea, I know) and it turned into a bad relationship with no trust, controlling issues on his side, and me refusing to accept the control. He still lived in the prison city 2 hours away and I would drive every Sunday at 6 am to spend the day with him. Everything was good when we were together, and then throughout the week he would get more and more anxious. It was messy and complicated, I ended up questioning my sense of self and just living such a confused life. He loved me, I was wonderful but I was also terrible for the things I did. My friends and my parents intervened and (rightfully) made me leave him. But now, 4 months later, even though I am getting better, I still question myself and the kind of person I really am. These 2 people were so close to me and the whole situation really destroyed me. It was never my intention to be a bad person. I’m not sure why I made the post but it feels good, if anyone has advice for me I’d greatly appreciate it.",02Jun2019,1
103,"Not sure where to start. I'll try not to make this too long, but explain some of the details. I've been experiencing depression for years now. It started as a lost of interest maybe 9 years ago, and has slowly spiraled to what I would consider severe clinical depression. I know I need help, I want help, I've asked and tried to find it and just can't seem to get it. As has been my experience over a life time, I fall through the cracks. How bad is my depression? I literally have a record in my head playing over and over saying ""I feel so sad, I mean really sad. To the point I'd rather not exist sad. You will never experience happiness again no matter what you try or how hard you fight. You are worthless, no self confidence and no one likes you. Everything you do is wrong. Wrong. Wrong...."" You get the idea. basically just reminded every moment of everyday how much I suck. It stays with me all the time, even when I'm asleep. Just a deep, sadness.

&amp;#x200B;

Some days are better than others. Some are worse. Today is one of the worse I've had ever. I go through days like this. It's to the point it absolutely hurts to be alive, physically hurts. I can't tell you the last time I felt a bit of happiness, literally over 4 years ago for a period of one day! It use to be fleeting, I'd have a moment here, or a moment there. Lately, it's non existent. It's hard to convince myself to get up in the morning knowing I won't feel a bit of happiness no matter what I do or try. I just want to sleep all day, if I could, but it's not an option.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't consider myself suicidal. I wish I didn't exist, but think that's different and my Dr. has told me so. Suicide is not an option. I have four young kids, and when I think of how that would effect them...it's just not something I want to put them through. I think of being a child again and how hard it would have been to lose one of my parents at a young age. It would have been devastating! And it keeps me from doing anything stupid. That being said, there is a very serious part of me scared that I'm just going to hit a day like today, and it will be too much. And though I'm not suicidal, I'll make a dumb decision when the sadness gets too much. At this point, I think that's a certainty. I just don't know when that will be. Just scary. I'm not going to be suicidal, it's just going to happen and I'm worried I'm not far from that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to get help many times, and haven't had any luck. Before I had a little money. Now money is a HUGE barrier because I have lost my job and have nothing. Everything I do have goes to pay bills and keep us housed.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on medication. I started off with going to my family Dr. He prescribed me medication, can't remember what it was, but was a common anti depressant. It did nothing. So after a month, he doubled it. Nothing. After another month, he upped it again to the max amount. It gave me seizures! I know he was just trying to help, but he didn't have much experience with Depression and should have referred me to a psychiatrist to start with instead of trying to wing it. He did eventually refer me.

&amp;#x200B;

I started seeing a psychiatrist and she put me on new medication. I've been on a number of them. I wish I could remember all the names, but have NO memory at all. I know Rexulti was in there, anti anxiety medicine. Nothing seemed to help. Instead of trying different things, she would up the dosage and tack on something else. Looking back, I don't think she really tried to understand what I was going through or what needed to be treated. I would meet with her for 10 minutes, tell her I was depressed and she would throw things against the wall blindly to see what would help. Never got an official diagnosis. When it didn't help, she would up the dosage. When that didn't work, add something new in. Up the dosage, etc...Eventually I was put on Lithium. That was a big mistake and not sure WHY she put me on Lithium. I was placed on a fairly high dosage, along with 5 other medications. While I was on it, I didn't realize how bad it was messing me up, but the Lithium made me into a zombie with no self control, no ability to feel anything or care. Just made me numb with no control over my life. In addition, I started having a number of medical issues. Unsure of what to do or what was causing it, I stayed the course with her advice in hopes it would get better. My medical issues got worse until I lost my job. I had no choice but to go off my meds, which was not hard as I didn't feel like they did anything but zombify me anyways. I no longer had the money to see a Psychiatrist and no money for medications. There was no option but to go off them.

  
As I was looking up the Lithium and how to ween myself off of it, I had a shocking discovery. First, what it was used to treat. I felt like it was NOT for me and what it's used for, I didn't have those problems at all. I was so upset to learn I was on it, didn't feel it would help me at all. Then I saw the side effects. Out of 13 listed, I had 11...they were the medical problems I thought I was experiencing...shakiness, light headness, impaired memory, no concentration...I immediately stopped taking it. It took care of SO many issues I'd been having. I felt so much better off Lithium than on it. It just made me feel worse, helpless. I never should have been on it. I decided then I would not be back, just quit my meds and without money at all, would try to manage my depression and anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

That's not going so well. I realize now more than ever, I need help. Otherwise it's not going to end well. I've sought help a number of ways, but nothing has worked out. Example, I contact my pastor and asked if there was anyone at the church I could talk to, let him know what I was going through. I had done this years before and never received an answer, but was desperate and needed somewhere to turn. Thankfully he replied back wanted to talk to me immediately. I met with him once to let him know what was going on. It was helpful, such a relief. I think to be able to tell someone, to no have to suffer in silence for fear of embarrassment or small mind-ness was a big help. He immediately wanted to see me back in a few days to talk things over a little more, which I did. And then...tried to contact him again, nothing. No answer. And again, no answer. I've since seen him at church. Doesn't ask me how I'm doing, or remember ""oh yeah, I need to check in on you! Let's talk!"" Nothing. It's like our talk never existed and he has no desire to help anymore. I never asked for his help though, just if there was someone at church I could talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

How can you save yourself when you feel like you are not worth saving and feel that others feel that way too? At what point are you too far gone? Have I passed that point? I try to tell myself I am worth saving, it is what keeps me fighting, but deep in my heart I'm starting to realize that's not true. Everything I do, my daily interactions, bad luck, etc...reinforce that thought. How do you keep going with no help, fighting a battle you can't win? I just keep fighting.

&amp;#x200B;

I should also mention I am married, but my wife is not understanding or helpful at all. When I first approached her with what I was going though, was told to ""man up"" basically. When I try to tell her what's going on, on day's like today when I just can't face life at all and try to talk to her, she just gets mad and tells me to get over it, move on, make my mind up I want to feel better. I'm a very clear headed person, and honest. I am able to see myself, my flaws and others and have an open mind. I know what's going on. She can be a very mentally abusive person. If I do 100 things right, and 1 thing wrong, I can guarantee you she will find that one bad thing, ignore the 100 good things, and destroy me for being a mistake prone un-perfect human being. So yeah, no help there. Truthfully, I think she has a few mental issues herself but is unable to see them or admit that to herself. Instead, projects them on to me and takes it out on me. She can be very nice one day, and the next be extremely mean. It's up and down. Not a source of help for my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

The one person that I could count on for anything, my mom, died a few years ago suddenly. My dad is alive, but has so many health problems of his own, is not able to help with mine and I refuse to put him through it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no friends, and what family I do have, I think my wife has convinced them I am crazy, and they believe it. I've really be gaslit on a number of things by her. She is bad to take a small incident, blow it up and make it into something It never was. Hope that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I did have a stay in a mental health institution and was the best thing I've done so far for myself! I wish I could go back. With how bad I feel today, I know I need to be where I can get help. But again, money is a barrier and I haven't paid off my last visit, so not an option.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways...didn't mean to make this so long. Basically, what I'm asking, is with no money or means to get money, how do I get help? Is that even an option or am I stuck to suffer through this on my own? I don't want to anymore, it's hard. I know now that what I have can't be helped, it's a disease and has to be treated as such. I didn't choose to be depressed, just like a cancer patient didn't choose to be sick. It just happened. And for whatever reason, my body does not have the ability to produce the chemicals I need to be happy! Life is crushing me. I'm literally running out of time, waiting for my life to fully blow up and go nuclear on me. I'm in a bad bad spot. I know now I'm most likely not going to get better without the proper medication and help...but with no money and no means, have no idea where to turn. I'm lost and on my last stand. I can't fight anymore and desperately don't want to give up. But I also don't want to live my life, every second of everyday, shouldering this incredible burden. I'm just tired. I'm tired of fighting. I just want to give up. What can I do?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",02Jun2019,2
104,"Here is the context of my experience.

I called a social service agency and spoke with a social worker.

She gave me the name of this employment agency that they are partnered with. I lost my job from a prior private employer who discovered I was homeless and I could not meet the appearance expectations due to the low pay.

People want others to be pulled down to their levels and never rise above it seems. 

I was NOT late nor missed time from work. Employers need people who are well rested and who can live and work on moderate incomes. 

Scroll down to ""what types of jobs do you have?""

https://firststepstaffing.com/faq/

This agency shows low skilled jobs for formerly incarcerated or chronically homeless who need a chance to work again.

* The avg annualized pay is $22,500. 

https://firststepstaffing.com/mission/

I was silenced and NOT allowed to ask questions.

I have an IRS lien from a home sold in a short sale. That lien from the shortage is garnishable.

I had to move out of State, live in my car and take a job that paid MORE than $22,500, but not enough to rent.

I cant rent right now until my income is at a living and sustainable wage.

 $22,500 is $1,374 per month take home.  $10.81 per hour

The social worker would not let me speak or ask questions.

I felt silenced me into submission.

A very low skilled job culture that is designed for the formerly incarcerated, wouldnt be the right fit. Id feel stuck like I couldnt ""work"" my way out.

This is a take it or leave it menu.

I would still be homeless because my lien (im not here to discuss my lien or terms of my lien), would leave me with $500 for housing, car maintenance, phone, utilities.

Id be stuck in my car with no way to save.

How can the website claim that they help people when they're enslaved in low pay and stuck?

The problem with that is my mum is the last person I want to know because we barely have a relationship and last time I was suicidal she just mocked me and told me to stop attention seeking. She's also just generally not very nice to me and I know she'll use the rape and miscarriage as ammunition against me and I can't bear having to go through that as well.

107,"*trigger warning for suicide and self harm*
But it just seems a bit dramatic ? I don’t know if my problems are that serious?

My mental health has been sh** for so many years now. I’ve self harmed many times, sometimes I feel like I have mental breakdowns where small things stress me out to the point that I have to go hide somewhere and scream and cry. I hate having to cry before I go into work and then walking in like nothing happened.  
I’m losing all of my motivation and sometimes I feel so disconnected from everything that I CANT cry, no matter how much I feel that swelling feeling in my chest/throat.  
and I’ve come close to ending my life before. It would’ve actually happened once if there weren’t police at the bridge I drove to that night. I dream and fantasize and plan it very often, but that’s the only time I’ve ever truly nearly done it. I used to take acetaminophen, but BARELY enough over the allowed dosages just to see if anything would happen. It was stupid, I know, could’ve fucked up my organs. All I ever got was mild pain. I was hoping it would be enough for something to happen without committing to ending it completely so somebody would get the hint that I need help. 

Other than that one isolated incident though, I don’t know if I actually would ever be able to go through with killing myself, I feel too cowardly. Although sometimes I really do scare myself.  
Checking myself into a mental hospital does seem dramatic but I feel as if I WANT to do something dramatic because I’ve been crying out to my parents for help since I was a teen and nobody will listen. The one time I asked for help because I had relapsed (cutting), my dad straight up told me that therapy is a waste of time and money and that I’m just looking for attention. I feel like nobody cares and I feel so awful only being able to Vent to my friends because none of them feel bad to the extent that I do; and I feel like telling them my problems is selfish and puts a lot of stress on their backs. 

But I don’t know if the way I feel is serious enough for a solution like checking myself into a hospital. Plus there would be embarrassing consequences - having to call out of work and tell them where I went. My coworkers would find out, I like them a lot and don’t want them to think any less of me. My friends might judge me too. My family would make fun of me and walk on eggshells around me. The people I know who have been checked in told me it was a miserable experience. 

I don’t know how to start therapy on my own though; I’m under my parents health insurance so I would have to go to my family’s primary doctor to start and my dad would find out and be disappointed in me. If I was prescribed medication or if I was referred to therapy we probably wouldn’t be able to afford it.

110,"Hello, just found this subreddit ready to expose myself here - I'm 26 years old, born/identify as a man engaged, and having trouble pinpointing what's up with me mentally.

I'm trying not to write a story but I definitely need to start in grade school, where that can be summed up by an irregularity in my stomach, leading to some bullying, and somewhere in the middle of all that I recall my parents having me tested for some mental health things. 

I went to a separate speech class, and I also remember taking tests that were one on one with a specialist. I have no idea what they determined though. Words are definitely not my forté, as I choose my words carefully while speaking, and I have a slight stutter. Texting is a Godsend for me. But also tiring since I overuse the backspace button. And I mean I delete complete thoughts almost every message. If I had lyrics to memorize in my rock band however, I practiced and could sing my part without trouble. College was ok, got through the first two years and then tried a degree in music education before realizing that wasn't for me.

I am mostly having trouble focusing. And maybe it's as simple as ADD (I'm definitely NOT hyperactive though). My fiancee will give instructions aurally, and without fail I will complete 1/2 tasks, or 2/3. At work, I double check everything I do not because it's life or death if I make a mistake, but because there is plenty of time when I'm in ""airhead"" mode. When I sit down and practice my instrument then I can be productive for the first 10 minutes, and afterwards I will continue without a sense of purpose. I'll play, but it's not structured at all. I like to play poker, math is my best subject by far. But after a few hands my critical thinking goes down SIGNIFICANTLY. Not to say it's easy, but I want to be able to make decisions, and consider opportunity costs and whatnot further than 20 minutes. I'm not asking to be exactly as efficient on my 4th straight hour compared to my 1st hand. 

Tldr; I haven't been diagnosed with anything. I think I have ADD because I can't focus. My brain is fully developed by now, hoping there's help",02Jun2019,1

I am a female of 17 years (turns 18 soon) who have had mental problems since about the age of 13, it started to get much more severe the summer I turned 14. I haven't talked to my mom since it started to get severe, she is a big part of why it started, I therefore live with my dad.

The winter after I turned 14 my dad got to know that my mental health was bad. Shortly after (maybe a month) I told him that I couldn't go to school that day because of my mental state, he called the school and said that u was sick. When he came home that day he wanted to know why that day was worse than the days before, when I told him that I didn't know he accused me of lying. I had to make up I lie for him to leave me alone. That day I decided to not let him know more about my mental health because he don't understand

I'm now truly afraid of him knowing how I feel but a month ago I got a panic attack in front of his girlfriend and everything resulted in me not going to an event that was mandatory. The panic attack was because of stress, I needed that weekend to study for school. I tried to explain to him that it was because of stress and that I got stressed to the point that I couldn't do what I needed to do and that he couldn't expect me to clean my room or make food to my sister, she is old enough to make it on her own. My dad accused me of lying and being lazy, and only got more angry when I told him that he was wrong.

My anxiety and depression is at an all time high. I started a new job about 2 months ago - and it's such an incredible position - but it's doing awful things for my anxiety. Aside from that, I just feel like my PTSD is triggered almost all the time and I can't deal with it. I know I should eat better, I know I should go to the gym, I know I should be making music / art like daily, but I can't bring myself to. I've been dealing with this long enough to know what helps, so I feel so guilty and like such a waste of space when I get back into that headspace and don't do those things. I'm having a really hard time with feelings of low self worth, I am absolutely always on the verge of tears, when I do something wrong at work, I completely shut down and cry and am a mess over it. It's like brain is convinced there's no room for mistakes, ever, anywhere in life. Luckily with work, my boss is super understanding and really gentle with me about things - even though I fucking hate that she has to worry about my mental state - I'm grateful for that. I feel completely out of control. I will say things haven't been ideal in my personal life.

They were really dark and scary but they weren’t my own thoughts and they weren’t voices, I don’t know what they were but one thing is for sure and that’s that they were fucking scary( I called them demons cause that’s the only thing I felt suited them) Every night I dreaded going to sleep cause I knew as soon as my head hit that pillow they would be back. The scariest part of it all was that I had no idea what the thoughts were after they happened but I would remember how they made crying in bed while trying to sleep which was big because I never cried, like ever. They scared me so much that I developed insomnia and now I’ve completely forgotten how to fall asleep and I struggle a lot with it. It’s like all through the day I want to sleep but as soon as it’s time for sleep my brain just goes, nope we aren’t going to sleep.

120,"Hello, my name is Jako. I'm a teenaged boy from Europe. I wanted to get someone to tell me if what my brain does is normal.

I've been alone for most of my life. I only had one friend and I only hung out with him. I never went out with him. I wasn't obsessed with him but he was the only person that would go out with me.

When I got back from school, sometimes, I didn't even leave my house. I just stayed at home, not doing anything except play Minecraft on my tablet or watch YouTube by myself. I have 4 more siblings, 2 older brother, and 2 older sisters. My oldest brother left school long before I started 1st grade and my youngest sister left 8th grade when I started 1st grade. My older brother was only 2 years older but he never really liked me nor does he like me now so I didn't even have him to play with. 

So I'm guessing that all of this is coming from the lack of a social life.

When I'm alone my brain starts talking to people in my head. Sometimes I physically react to the conversations my brain makes up or I talk back out loud. I'm not in control of this and it happens all the time. 

I don't know if this is normal, I do know that just talking to yourself is normal but I don't know if what I do is.

i also had trouble with acne so i started taking accutane and i recently got off of it around the 2nd or 3rd week of april.

ever since January, i've been experiencing something that's really hard for me to describe but i'll try my best. sometimes literally out of nowhere i get hit with this strange feeling. i feel a ""light"" and ""floaty"" feeling in my head, the inside of my body feels ""cold"" ?? and i feel like i'm floating. everything and everyone around me doesn't seem to be real, it feels very dreamlike, and i know it's not a dream. it's like my senses become aware of what's really happening. i feel lost, scared, and confused. when i get hit with this strange feeling, i stop what i'm doing and just stay frozen while looking around at my surroundings. sometimes i cry because it's so freaking scary. if it happens when i'm with my friends or family, they say that i sound scared or look scared.
-----PROBLEM 2-----
also, i've been having ""memory problems"" ?? i don't know what it is really. like i could be thinking or i could be doing something that triggers this certain thing to happen. so let's say, for example, i'm at school walking in the hallways and all of a sudden i get this very vague memory of something very vague happening along with a vague image in my head. it feels familiar, like it actually happened, but at the same time it feels like the memory isn't mine and that it never happened to me. i lowkey know what it is but at the same time i REALLY don't know what it is. this is starting to happen daily now, multiple times a day and it's honestly really annoying/distracting. i get different ""memories"" too. it stresses me out because i try really hard to figure out what i was thinking about, but i never end up figuring it out.

i visited my psychiatrist earlier in may and told her about what i've been experiencing and she said it could've been the accutane affecting me. she said that the next time i see her to tell her if i still experience these things and we'll see what we will do from there. i visit her in july.

I don't know if what i remember really happened or if i'm just making it up. The only emotions that i can identify at this point are sadness and anger, I don't know what love or happyness feels like. I don't really know what I want, I'm just going with the flow of things. Everytime I want to talk about this I feel like I'm just seeking attention and/or pity. I really want to feel again but I don't even know what that is anymore. I was feeling very suicidal after my ex took away some of my friends, but they didn't even care about me so i guess it's for the best. I met a new girl, she fell in love with me and I feel terrible about that, i don't know what to think about that and i don't want to hurt her... 
I hurt myself a few times and get the urge to do it, but I'm even bad at that, according to my mother. I think i'm hurting myself bc i want attention, which makes it a lot worse for me. 
I don't know what to do anymore, I was in therapy 2 times but neither of them was going on for a long time... One because of my mother, she was embarrassed that i needed help, and one because my psychiatrist didn't want to help me. 2 years after that I'm trying to find help but there's always this voice in the back of my head that just tells me I shouldn't. I feel like i'm a terrible person. My ex used to tell me that my family is bad and I was the only good person of them, but recently she told me that i am actually the worst of them... Sorry for the long post and telling you guys like half of my life story...",02Jun2019,1

hey

im 32 yo, male, gay, white. 

i’ve recently gone through a rather drastic episode of self growth. a lot of things became very clear, very fast, and now i find myself at a lost. theres a gap between who i used to be and who i am now, that i don’t know how to deal with. i feel like i woke up from a comma and time has passed by and i was not there. had my now-self lived my life he wouldn’t have my history, my baggage, my illnesses. everything is suddenly unfamiliar, uncharted: being a friend, being a lover, being a professional, being a son, being a brother, being gay, being. 

my body betrays me. the fog suddenly clears and under it lies a body of self neglect and self abuse. going outside, being in public, makes my anxiety take over, i can’t stop it, i can’t block it out, i can’t talk myself out of it, i can’t calm myself, until i get away. or get stoned. being with lovers, being intimate, is finally conceivable but absolutely foreign. having sex with a person, rather than a body, is new, is scary as hell, is exciting but also humiliating and frustrating and insecure and full of hurt and mistrust and bad joints and an aching back hiding an aching soul. being hostage within this body that says and does all these unintended things that you can’t seem to stop. it feels out of control, but not as a choice. 

all the boys that ever hurt me, all the girls who ever betrayed me, all the grown ups who constantly disappointed me - i can now *understand* they mean nothing, they are external and irrelevant to my sense of self. but i cannot unfeel them, i cannot forget countless little stabs, i cannot take away all the self hate and fear i beard for the last 20 years and make it suddenly disappear. 

I don’t know what to do, how to go on from here? any encounter that triggers emotion - books, tv, songs, walking in the street, going to work, going to the gym, taking the subway - is painful. hurts me. makes me face this self hate again, and i don’t know how to, i never have, i’ve always blocked it out when it surfaced, but now I’m consciously aware of it, its always there! right now i feel like most of the time i need to be either stoned, really distracted by something on a screen, jerking off, or all together, to not feel anxious, to not be uncomfortable. 

can anyone relate? avdise?",02Jun2019,1
134,"I have been in relationships for the last 20 years of my life, with the longest being a 13 yr marriage. After divorcing half a year ago, I went on several dates including an intense relationship that lasted a month with me ending it and feeling relieved. Until my most recent relationship, which has just hit the 3 month mark, I have never felt these feelings of fear of abandonment, anxiety, loss of self worth, and self destructive behavior.

She is everything I’ve always wanted and I know before I did what I’m about to explain she felt the same. After getting into a tiff which led her to go sleep on the couch, I let it stew and then just exploded, saying I’m done, leaving her keys and taking all my belongings from her home and leaving. I did it in a very dramatic fashion, I believe to induce a response, which I didn’t get. I also felt like I was not in my own body when I did that - another symptom of BPD. I immediately regretted that self destructive behavior because there’s no way I really want to break it off. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. We don’t really scream at each other. There’s a lot of disengagement when we fight and this seems to be the trigger for me.

I am now seeking help or any advice to save this relationship and to prevent this from happening again. I think finding some self soothing mechanisms as well as trying to focus back on reality when I’m under stress is what I need bit I will also see a psychologist. I’m in the US so any resources / highly recommended books would be appreciated. Thanks.",02Jun2019,1
135,"So for a while now I have been dealing with some problems. I would seem to be tired, irritable, having tens of intrusive thoughts on the daily, and just being unhappy. I was diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety, but I feel like there’s something that just isn’t right. I have this issue where whenever I think of something jumping out at me, or screaming, or seeing a terrifying figure. It seems to be actually there, like I stop seeing what’s in front of me and only see what’s in my head. It terrifies me sometimes, is this normal? If not what is it?",02Jun2019,1
136,"I don't know what's wrong with me. There probably isn't anything wrong with me but I'd like a label. Just, something that's real and validates the way I feel because sometimes I feel as though I'm just making it all up.
I go through phases of thinking about suicide a lot. I know I'll never go through with it because the thoughts of the aftermath are unbearable. I self harm and want to self harm more than I let on. Pinching my self really hard with my nails is my newest one but the oldest is hitting/punching myself or banging my head.
I've always had anger issues but I feel like they come and go.
Not being able to describe how I feel or put words to it is hard. I overthink and overanalyse too much.
I just feel so lost.",02Jun2019,1
137,"I understand each case is based on its merits but I am really struggling to make the decision to tell my parents.

I'm currently back living with them while they're putting me through law school and they're fully aware I have pretty bad mental health issues. But one thing they don't know is my history of self-harm, and it's happened again recently around exam season (which has resulted in me having to defer my exams till August because the law school was seriously worried about my mental health and any risk of suicide). Sometimes I just find myself In the lowest of places and don't know how else to cope, I'm so ashamed of it but feel if I was a parent I would want my child to tell me.

My biggest fear is that I would seriously hurt and disappoint them if I told them, and as much as they deserve to know I couldn't do it to them. 

Is it the right thing to do to keep such things from them? And if you've experienced something similar; how did you end up telling them?",02Jun2019,2
138,"Not sure how to start as I havent really spoke  to anyone about my mental state. Last year was intense. My ex lied to me and broke up with me. My dog passed away. My grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. All in the span of a couple of months. 2018 was rocky to say the least, i lost a lot of weight, had many break downs and thoughts of suicide on multiple occasions. In September I went to Switzerland with my best friend for 2 weeks which was a great detachment from ny horrible summer. However as soon as I came back, university started again and I was super busy as well as all my friends, which helped distract me but the breakup was still damaging my self esteem and self worth. In December, i had started seeing this new girl and things were going well. I finally felt good about myself again. I ended up cutting things off with her because school became really time consuming with 5 classes and my joining of a student association. This was in February. 

Everything was going great until mid-April when my final exams were all done and I was set to start my new internship. This is when my mental state really started to crash, and now, June 2nd, exactly one year after I got dumped, I am an all time low and don't know what to do. You would think that a year is enough to get over it, but I still find myself thinking about her frequently. My internship sucks, all my friends are taking classes and see each other all the time, I don't have time for the gym or guitar since work consumes all my time from 7 am to 6 pm. All my friends are trying to hook me up with girls but I refuse because I just dont have that interest anymore. I don't want to go through all that again. I don't enjoy the things I use to and I feel like my life has come to a stand-still. Nothing new or interesting is happening and it feels as though everyone else is getting closer but i'm being left behind. I can feel myself pushing my loved ones away, yet I don't know how to stop myself. People use to care, but i've pushed them away so long and have been so negative that I feel them distancing themselves, which just makes me even more miserable. I spend my weekends in bed, and try to go to the gym. I'll be invited to clubs, something which I use to love doing, and just sit there bored. I don't find pleasure in the things I once loved and i feel exhausted all the time. 

I tried explaining myself to one friend and she was shocked. ""You have good grades, you have friends and family, you're in shape and you play the guitar. Why don't you have good self esteem?"". Quite honestly, I don't know why. Ever since being dumped I never fully recovered. I'm at the point where ive accepted that im miserable and ran out of ideas or solutions to this. 

If you've made it this far down my word wall, thank you for listening to me. No one really does anymore. Im not quite sure what to do anymore, and I can tell people don't know what to do with me either. But thats okay I guess, theres nothing I can do about it. This is me now, even though I hate who ive become. 

Thank you.",02Jun2019,1
139,"So. Yeah. It’s finally happening. 

In the December of 2018 my mental health plummeted drastically, to the point I would not eat, move or sleep. For around two months I could not move from my bed and would have constant panic attacks that would be triggered by the slightest sound. 

That was the worse my mental health has effected me my whole life. And due to that period of time I was very close to being hospitalised but as I was not in any immediate danger - I was not attempting to kill myself - I was ignored. 

Now however, after months of professionals after professionals knocking at my door, tomorrow will be the day I am taken from the four walls I have been looking at for a dizzying amount of time. 

All of my overnight experiences away from home have been traumatic to say the least. From midnight panic attacks without any coping mechanisms to a negligent father while I was threatening to kill myself, I’ve gone through it all. So, you can imagine what I am feeling right now...

I am 100% aware this time is completely different - I am allowed to see my mother, whom of which has been the only constant support I have had - every day and visit home on weekends and there are professionals there trained to deal with people like me and even worse cases. However... I am still terrified. During these past four years the most I did was make myself a drink and now I’m going to a place I have never even visited before and expected to do school, socialise, get better, sleep, cook for myself and eat around people. I am expected to do the very things that causes me to panic. And I am not ready. 

As I am writing this it is 10:42pm and just on the other side of my room are three bags containing my stuff. Wow. Is this really happening? 

While I am there phones are not allowed... and it’s just my luck that my phone is the only coping mechanism that has worked so far. My phone has been the only thing keeping me sane all this time. With it I can distract myself, laugh, cry, relate, learn and finally stop overthinking. I know, it’s not exactly healthy but it’s all I’ve known. It’s the only thing that has worked for me and no professionals have given me anything to prove otherwise. 

I am not ready. 

Sure it’s a positive change and of course it’s going to be hard at the start but I am not ready, mentally and physically, to go through the stress of getting there and actually living there.

I am terrified and I’m scared I’m not going to have a choice anymore.",02Jun2019,2
140,"So ever since I was a lil boy I’ve always had a hard time getting rid of things or giving them away, when I find something, I keep it. When I was little I had a game for a game boy and at some point i traded it for another game. Later that night I cried a lot because I felt, like the game that I gave away felt like I didn’t love it because I gave it away. I do this a lot with lots of different things. It’s not like hoarding where people have lots of stuff, but like the things I have I can’t give up because I don’t want whatever it is to feel unwanted. Whenever there was a toy on the ground away from the other toys I’d want to put it with the other toys so it wasn’t lonely. I can’t treat items bad because I’ll feel bad, I’ll feel like something has emotions and will be sad if I don’t care for it. What is this? Why do I do it? Anyone else?",02Jun2019,3
141,"I don't really know how to start this so I will just go ahead and try my best. Sorry if the post seems a bit confusing at times but I really need to get this of my chest somewhere so thanks for reading and maybe someone has any ideas on the issue.

So I can't really say for how long this has been going on but for a while now (I'd say a couple of months maybe 3-4) I constantly feel down. I have issues sleeping and no matter how long I sleep I still feel tired. I still go out with friends but I don't really enjoy it as much as I did before. I don't really know why. I feel like my life is just going downhill. I didn't tell anyone so far mostly because I don't know who I should tell and how I should start that conversation. I can't really sleep to well and no matter how much I sleep I will still feel tired and like I don't have a lot of energy. Somedays I don't eat anything (not sure if I maybe feel bad because I don't eat or if I don't eat because I don't feel well) I don't even really feel great about posting this here because probably a lot of people here have ot worst than me. I am unsure about a lot of things lately and even though I would never even consider suicide I feel like if I was never born it would be better if that makes any sense. I had these phases a lot in the past but not as bad as lately. I am not sure if there is anything wrong with me and I don't think anyone would notice if there was because I became really good at making people think that I'm just fine. I still enjoy moments where I don't have to think about anything, when I'm out I feel fine but I feel like if I would tell anyone people wouldn't really understand. I don't know what to do and I don't know who to talk to, even though I have really supportive friends and a supportive family I don't know if I could tell anyone about this. I feel like people would just get worried about me and I don't want them to be worried because it might make them feel worst. I don't really know how to explain my feelings and I don't really understand them myself. I also don't really want to tell my family mostly because my Mom lives with a bipolar disorder and depression and I don't want to make it harder for everyone. I feel like I am just kind of useless and making everyones life harder. I really don't know how to explain the situation better but maybe someone here went or is going through a similar situation.

If you read this post this far thanks for reading and if someone has any advice/ideas I would really appreciate it. In short I just don't know how to get my life back on track. If someone only has an idea on how to start a conversation about this with anyone let me know as well that would probably already help a lot.

Sorry for the longs post and sorry if this does not make any sense at all but I had to get this out somewhere and I couldn't really find a better place than here.",02Jun2019,1
142,"Just interested in hearing what people think. I’ve always been determined to handle my own mental health rather than being on meds. Last year I started seeing a therapist and I recently got (kind of?) diagnosed with PTSD. My therapist thinks I should try medication, and my best friend also thinks it might be good to try it then decide if it’s right for me. 
Is there anyone else that has been in a similar situation? What are the pros and cons of being on medications for PTSD/anxiety/depression?? 

Thank you, friends! Take care!",02Jun2019,2
143,"Depression and schizophrenia pretty much turned me into someone i don't recognize anymore.
 There's a girl who is really into me and said she likes me and we even kissed, but i feel like I'm just there purely for the sake of the physical interactions. The hugging and cuddling made everything so much better but i know i'm not that really into this girl. We're totally different persons.
 Should i be upfront and tell her how i feel?",02Jun2019,1
144,"I'll get right into it, I'm a 15 year old girl and I think I might qualify for conduct disorder.

I'll list some examples I can remember of myself showing symptoms of the disorder. I don't remember too much or too well, I think I suppressed large chunks of my childhood, it feels like there are a lot of gaps. 

When I was between the age of 6 and 8 years old my 'best friend' (I'll mention why this is in quotations later) would get sick, and she'd get upset and cry. I specifically remember getting very frustrated and angry, I thought she was pretending for attention and I definitely did not like the other children and adults asking if she was okay / giving her special treatment. I don't remember if I was completely open about this, but I was probably very moody about it.
I think I stole a few things from stores, but nothing serious. 

When I was 7 years old my mum was diagnosed with Encephalitis, it almost killed her because back then they knew very little about what it was and how to treat it. 
Read here for more information https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis . 
I came home just like any other day to find that my mum wasn't there. I don't remember anything from that day except going into my room and sitting down on my bed, in the background I heard my big brother crying downstairs, asking my Dad when she'd be home, if she was okay, and when he'd be able to see her again. She was rushed to the hospital that day, and I didn't see her for a long time. I went to visit her sometimes, but wasn't particularly bothered about going. When I did go, I don't remember at all how I felt. 
Come to think of it, I don't remember any of those days afterwards, or really before. The harder I try to grasp onto those memories the further away from me they seem to be, I don't see anything. These are the gaps I mentioned. 
I don't feel anything about it, it does not affect me at all. However, the thought of her dying now scares me, but in a muted way, as if I'm trying to supress it. I don't want to elaborate. 

She recovered from the Encephalitis, at the cost of being affected with double vision for some time, some sight loss, disorientation, memory loss, and needing physiotherapy. 
But when I was 11 years old my mum was then diagnosed with Cancer, every Friday she'd come back home after her Chemotherapy and throw up all night. I also remember very little from that time, only that I would lay in bed disgusted and angry with her, I  was trying to sleep and she was keeping me awake. I wanted her to shut up, to put it simply. I know this is wrong, and I feel some shame put on a very very small scale. I know it's wrong but I don't care that it is.

She recovered eventually, I acknowledge that she must be a very strong woman, I know I should feel pride in her, I should love her, but I don't, and that doesn't bother me. I don't hate her, she's pleasant to be around sometimes, and sometimes she isn't. I pretend to love her though, it's very easy to simulate those feelings and act appropriately. Although I do emphasise on the acting, in every social interaction I have I feel as if I'm on autopilot. Saying something and feeling something else. Or in this case, not feeling something. I pretend to love her for my benefit. If I told her I feel indifferent about her then she'd treat me differently. Most definitely she'd treat me coldly, like I'm a selfish freak I imagine. She wouldn't help me out anymore, stuff like that. I depend on her a lot. 

Everyone else I meet I pretend to care for them too, I can't open up about not being able to reciprocate their feelings because they'd get upset. 
With the acceptance of one person, which I'll talk about soon. 

Then Highschool started, the only person I was actually close to was that same best friend from before, and I followed her everywhere. I had no desire to make more friends or meet anybody new. However, she had another friend she was very close with. I did not like this at all, I felt threatened by her, even though she had done nothing wrong. I thought that my friend would leave me for her, so I became very scheming and manipulative. I stole things from my friend and hid them in the other girl's bag, I told my friend things about her that weren't true, I called her names and insulted her, I wrote on the restroom walls about her, things I knew would embarrass her and make people hate her. I was definitely bullying her. I know it was bad, but I don't feel remorse. I did it, so what?
My friend got us friendship bracelets one day, she made sure to get me the best one. Probably because she knew I'd get angry at her if the other girl's was better. Even so, I was still pissed. I later stole it from her pocket in the changing area while she was in gym. They asked me if I knew where it was, I said no, and took it home that day. I was 13 years old I think. Yeah, it was petty and a very pathetic display, but I don't care. I wouldn't do it again though.

When I was 13 I was extremely aggressive, this lasted up until I was late in my 14th year. I'd scream at my mum, throw everything I could around the house and down the stairs to try and relieve my anger and frustration. And I mean everything, it didn't matter how heavy it was. Heavier was better, as the crash was louder and the smashing was more intense after I'd dropped it down the stairs. I'd explode because of the littlest things. This mostly happened because my mum simply would never shut up, she was always driving at me, she knew what she was doing. I firmly believe that she wanted a reaction out of me so she had an excuse to laugh at me, call me a psychopath, a freak, and everything else. She joked about me with her friends, my family, everyone was laughing at me, they thought I was insane. It was humiliating, but in the end I didn't care, I'd get so angry and the only way to calm it down was to explode. I later got more daring, I started to shove her, she'd shove back. I threatened to hit her with things, sometimes I did hit her. I kicked, I punched, I bit her so hard one time that she had a huge, horrible bruise on her arm for a while. I once dropped a sewing machine down the stairs while she was stood at the bottom. I didn't intend to hit her, but it hit her hand and caused quite a bad injury. I didn't regret it, but I cried because my big brother yelled at me, he scared me. I still don't feel remorse over it. Thankfully she doesn't hold it against me, which confuses me. 

Back then I hated her, I believed that she was evil. That she didn't love me, that she was always manipulating me, and making fun of me in some way, I genuinely thought I was the victim of a narcissistic mother. 
Now, here is where I'm unsure actually. She does show symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder, but it's a lot calmer these days. We get along fine, we argue way less. And I think because of that I don't recognise it as a problem anymore and just forget about it. 

When I was 13 and all this was going on I moved in with my dad because of these fights, I had been refusing to go to school or leave the house for a long time, they thought moving would help, but I didn't attend much there either. It was okay for a bit, but I had no friends, and followed my cousin around everywhere, not interested in meeting someone else, and completely unsure of how to approach someone and start a friendship. When I stopped going again, my dad would cry. He'd ask why I wouldn't go, he asked what was wrong, he asked if I was okay, he asked if someone was hurting me. I didn't look at him, I thought it was gross and annoying the way he was acting, I wanted him to be quiet and leave me alone. 
I used to run away from home a lot too. Once after I finished school I tried to walk back to my mum's place, which is about 16 miles from there, before stopping at a gas station because I was paranoid that some guy was following me, and then was taken back to my dad in a police car. 
My dad used to say weird things to me, he'd get upset when I got angry with him, and threatened to kill himself, something I didn't understand at all at the time. I'd roll my eyes and think he was being ridiculous, and go back to whatever I was doing before. 

Moving meant I was leaving behind my 'best friend'. The quotations are because I'm not even sure we had a connection at all, I didn't feel anything when I left her behind. I told her over text, she was really upset I think, but I just told her she'd be fine. She was also being badly bullied at the time, and was later diagnosed with an eating disorder. I didn't and still don't feel anything for that. I eventually moved back into my old school, but by that time my anxiety around school and people had worsened significantly (I might go into this in detail in another post because it affects my life dramatically) , we weren't able to connect and drifted apart, we haven't talked for a very long time, and I'm fine with that. So as always, I spent my time alone, just how I liked it. 

Finally, I met someone online about 2 and a half years ago. For some reason, I developed an attachment to him, it of course was unlike anything I had experience with anyone before. He is special. I believed for a while that I loved him, but now I see it is more like an obsession. 
I care about how he is, I used to panic so much when I thought he was sad, even when there was nothing indicating that this would be true. I'd cry, I'd hit myself, I just had no idea how to handle that kind of anxiety, and I'd always wonder if it was my fault. He's had it hard, a lot harder than me, and it makes me sad. I want to make him happy, but I want to be the only one who can make him happy. I want him to care about only me. For some reason, I see everybody he knows as a threat, most of them I don't know. For some reason I think that if he cares about someone else, it means he doesn't care about me. It means he doesn't enjoy my company, it means he hates me, the list goes on. 
So when I found out he was dating someone he'd met online, I went ballistic. The amount of jealousy I felt was insane. I found out who she was, I bullied her, I manipulated her, I tried to convince her that he didn't care about her, I did every little petty thing I could do, but it never worked. Even today they're still friends, and just thinking about her makes me feel sick. Thinking about those two together makes my heart beat so loudly and hard in my chest its unbearable, sometimes I start shaking uncontrollably and I'm still twitching a bit and feel on edge for hours later, and the only way to relieve it, even a little, is to act on impulse. I've cried so much, she hasn't even done anything to harm me. Not intentionally, never. And that pisses me off. Now here is where the indifference is replaced by self loathing and disgust. I believe I am a disgusting person, I'm pathetic and vile, that's just how it goes. Yesterday I tried to convince my friend he was being selfish, I tried to plant seeds of doubt in his mind, but he saw right through me and even made things better with her. 

It's not all bad, I'm going to start working on myself. I'm going to get out of the house, get a job and keep busy, find a way to handle these impulses for the sake of my friendship with this guy, my future friendships, and my own tranquility. I'm going to see someone soon and ask about Conduct disorder and ASPD, I might show this post even. Maybe it's something else entirely, but I do hope it isn't nothing. 
I think I'll be alright. 

In case they aren't able to help me, what can I do to help myself?",02Jun2019,1
145,"There are online groups that encourage and support the taking of cold showers (or ""contrast showers"" or ""hot and cold showers"").  I frequented a Reddit group that was focused on cold showers. I was told that if you don't squirm and shout and cuss and complain and wriggle when the cold water hits you, that cold showers would get easier and easier for you.  If you just stand there without any complaining or squirming whatsoever, that your capacity to endure the cold shock will be greatly enhanced, beyond what mere practice (with screaming and shouting) could produce. It worked and is a very firmly established principle with cold shower people and ""polar bear"" bathers.             



It also works with hurt feelings. Wincing from hurt feelings sets you up for getting your feelings hurt again, and I do NOT mean because other people see you being weak and gleefully whack you for the fun of it. I DO mean that surrendering and letting go and NOT reacting but rather relaxing will greatly enhance your capacity to endure harsh words, over time. In fact, I submit to you that today's hurt feelings are mostly the result of yesterday's wincing.  The wincing this time hurts you next time. And there will be a next time. The world is filled with egos banging into each other.           



Stop wincing and the hurt goes away, over time. Each time that you minimize your reaction, the next time the harshness hurts less and eventually the hurt just disappears. This means that other people are doing you a favor to criticize you to your face, but it is a blessing that you can only benefit from if you endure the slings and arrows with fortitude, endurance, and calmness.             



The same exact thing happens with anger.  I would become irritated and blow-up.  That anger outburst would become mental impressions laying in wait in my heart like a dangerous coiled snake, and the next time that something unwanted happened that dangerous coiled snake would strike and I would blow my cork and say bad words.  But that cork blowing produced the mental impressions for the irritability for the next outburst. It is a vicious circle.            



I decided that every time I noticed anger arising I would say Meher Baba's saying ""The only Real Surrender is that in which poise is undisturbed by any adverse circumstance, and the  individual, amidst every kind of hardship, is resigned with perfect calm to the will of God."" as quickly as possible and try to practice it, of course, by letting-go and relaxing.   Over time, like a few weeks or months, my irritability simply diminished more and more until is hardly exists at all now. With reduced irritability, there were less anger outbursts, and when there was less anger outbursts, there was less irritability. That is called a virtuous circle, and I owe it all to Meher Baba.             



This is not repression. This is being a smart and spiritually oriented custodian of one's own mind. I used to say that I couldn't help being an anger monger; I was wrong, but I didn't know how to stop. I know now, and I am sharing this with you.      



This reminds me of Baba's saying once that the mind is good if it is used like a tool, but don't let the tool use you.",02Jun2019,1

149,"I’ve been seeing my psychologist for about 2.5 months again. She hasn’t brought it up too much this time but last time I saw her she wanted me to be evaluated and get medicated.

I don’t particularly care for medication, if I was on it it would have to be something with minimal side effects, weight gain being a BIG thing I need to avoid. 

Anyway, will therapists let you find your own psychiatrist or need to use one they refer you to? She used to take my insurance, now she doesn’t take any. I really can’t afford to see a psychiatrist that doesn’t take my insurance. I am willing to see someone, I think, but I’ve never seen someone who was directly referred. Is this common practice? I will ask her again myself when I see her, but I don’t want to sound like an idiot if that isn’t something that isn’t like normal practice.

I’ve never seen a psychiatrist so I don’t know what to expect. I also know it can take weeks/months to get in for an apt and idk if I can wait that long? 

Thanks!",02Jun2019,2

153,"Hey, I have no idea where to ask on this site for advice so I figured I'd post here. When I got out of high school, I went away for college, had a girlfriend that was still in high school. A lot of insecurities about myself led me to jealousy and not fully trusting my gf while we were away from each other. This brought a lot of tension into the relationship and while I was home after my freshman year I broke up with her at the end of summer before going back in fear of a repeat of emotions we went through the first year I was away. After a few weeks I realized the mistake I had made and absolutely hated myself, my grades were not good from my first year and coupled with the fallout of the relationship and my regret of ending it, I turned to smoking weed everyday because I hated living with myself and how I've failed at pretty much each point in my life. 

During winter break I realized I could not go back to the environment where I would smoke first thing in the morning before even going to eat food. I told my parents I what I was going through minus the weed part (my mom would actually kill me). I took time off of school and just worked from the new year to the fall where I started up at a local community college. At the beginning of the year I was seeking counseling but I stopped attending after awhile because I did not like the feeling I would have during the sessions. It seemed to me that the counselor would be questioning my every motive with each relationship I have had with people in my life which made me very self conscious of my actions. After a few months anyway of being home I was starting to feel better about myself to which was in part why I stopped attending. My first year at the community college went well, even though I did not make many friendships, I was caring about my school work and tried to finish up my AA. Everything in my life seemed to be going right up until about last spring when my grandpa died. It didn't really affect me too much when it happened but I feel like thinking about since has affected me mentally in a way. Made me more nervous about what our point in life is, what is this all for, whats the point in trying when it seems like its so hard for me to succeed, especially when it comes to academics. During the semester I would have class on weekdays then i would work Fri/Sat/Sun. Since last spring I've failed classes again at the community college. I've only needed one more science credit to graduate and move to another school to finish my bachelors. I've only needed to pass physics, failed that 3 times, or chemistry and I've already failed that twice now, only one more chance to retake. I was going to retake this summer but I started smoking again for a few weeks. During the past two semesters I would sign up for classes and feel somewhat confident but after a few weeks into the class I would feel like I lose focus of my goals, miss homework, miss studying for tests, get bad results then stop showing up to class and eventually failing the class only to repeat the same actions in the spring semester. In the spring semester I got a vape pen for weed and would smoke and it would put me in a state where I wouldn't care about anything really. Just get high play a little guitar, little videos games, and it wouldn't make me think of what my actions are doing to myself and my future self. My parents were out of town for two weeks and during that time I barely ate while I was high for most of the day. I was supposed to sign up for chem class this summer at that time so I can start new school in the fall but I failed to do that even and now I am probably going to have to do one more fall semester at the community college just for once class before getting my aa and being able to move on. 

I guess at the end of all this I notice I have a lack of motivation for everything. I used to work out strictly when I moved back home. This is side-related but I feel like form my first bout of depression, I messed up my spine from laying on the same side of bed for so long staring at my phone. I've been going to a chiropractor to try and help get it fixed, but I still feel so lazy trying to get back into a regular routine for working out, even a regular routine for anything productive in my life really. At times I feel like my brain is just mush since I haven;t pushed myself ot be to be better in so long. As I'm typing this I probably have so much stress I put myself through from trying to finish school (At this point, most my friends have graduated and moved on too). I feel like part of the people at my job may have been a bad influence so I quit that job, but I still feel like I'm not in control of what I want to get done which scares me the most at this point. I need to get that fire under my ass feeling again, I'm too content with waking up at 12 and doing nothing with my life. Please someone tell me something.",02Jun2019,2
154,"I'm a student in the gymnasium (Swedish High school) and I've for so long feelt burnout, but I have to keep working if i want my grade. I've been so far behind with my school work due to lack of motivation and energy (and ADD). I suspect that it's going to get worse after the summer break. I'm never able to catch up to the level they teach on. I oftent feel like I dont belong.

I can never rest and breath, I always feel stressed, I don't know how to calm down. And on top of it all, my state of mind.. I'm suffering from Anxiety and depression [self diagnosed.]
I know your supposed to rest but I can't right now, I have to keep working. I don't know how to recover.
Also, When i'm actually have time to lay down i get restless... I can't handle it.

I finished my last essay but I don't feel proud or relived, if anything i'm more stressed?

Tips? Best way to recover during summer break?",02Jun2019,4

156,"A few days ago i had a dream or imagined while waking up that someone did something to me while i was sleeping, this is very unlikely for multiple reasons, for example my memory of this is blurry and if i did have an image or sound memory of this how would that even be possible if i was sleeping? No matter how unlikely (although possible) this thought is it still seems like it happened and i cant stop thinking about it. Is it possible to dream something and be so convinced that its real that you forget its a dream? Is it possible to hear or make up images while sleeping of things that are actually happening? How can i prove myself that this never did happen? I guess these are the questions i would like answered as well as any other advice (i did smoke a fairly small amount of weed that night but i went to sleep with most effects gone, aswell i did have other normal dreams that night).",02Jun2019,1
157,"I really don’t know what to do. I’ve been working for a company for 7 months. At first it was great. I secured an admin role, I made a great friend. The money was substantial enough to have me living comfortably, things were starting to look up.

Before finding that job I’d gone through 3 years of emotional abuse with an ex partner and had my self esteem and self worth ripped away.

Finding this job was like finding a part of myself again, knowing I was really great at something even if it was an admin job.

4 months in I was offered a promotion into sales, more money, a work car. I thought it would be a good transition as I knew the requirements well from my months working for the company already.

Now I dread going to work everyday, I barely sleep. When I get home at 6:00pm, I sit in my room and work till 8pm. I didn’t just transition into the sales role, I still do the same level of admin work.

The business is in crisis and I’m starting to feel the effects of it. Receiving emails daily at all hours of the morning from my employer, on weekends and late at night. 

I am so scared of failing because not only will it mean me out of a job but the business could fail too and my friend will be out of a job and I’ll be the reason.

I know this isn’t rational, one person can’t destroy a business but there I can certainly contribute and that has me so on edge.

I’m afraid to look for a new job as I don’t want to leave my friend, and I don’t want to see the business fail, but I also am not the employer and I don’t make the decisions that could help it succeed or fail.

My mental health is most important but I’m torn between asking for my old admin job back or leaving.

I don’t want to stick it out and be driven to therapy like I had in a previous job because I overworked and had so much fear of being fired. Now this feeling has tripled but instead of being fired it’s the fear I’ll be the reason a business fails, a woman goes bankrupt and everyone will look to me to blame and just remind me of all the worthless things I was told for so many years.

I want to do the right thing but I don’t know what that is and it’s tearing me apart.",02Jun2019,2
