0,"INFP 2w1 if you're into that. :) I'm diagnosed with C-PTSD. It's related but not the big picture I'm asking for.

My friends mostly say they react to situations in the present based on present information that is related to their current situation. I find I react based on past experiences (often distant past) that looked similar but are unrelated.

Example: I am monogamous in a happy relationship. He is making friends with a woman. I have absolutely no problem with that, he's trustworthy beyond a doubt. And yet, this news gave me a strong emotional reaction based on old baggage with a different partner. I have no reason to believe that my current partner has bad intentions, and all of the evidence in our current relationship is reassuring. Yet, this strong emotional reaction of fear hits me like a brick wall because of the past. My partner feels bad for me. He has had similar experiences in the past of being cheated on, but his mind is wired differently and he understands we are secure and different from his past.

I do this with everything. I'm thankful to be self-aware about it, but I feel held back and punished by these old, outdated feelings that override my present experience if I'm reminded of any old pain. I have been in therapy my entire adult life processing emotions and experiences, healing my inner child, and learning mindfulness techniques, but it feels like a core tenant of my being that I am wired this way. It can pop up no matter how great a day I'm having, and it happens with so many different things it's exhausting. I'll work hard on one outdated emotional pathway, and ten new ones I've never seen before will pop up.

I'm confident other people could have lived the life I've lived and not developed C-PTSD. I feel particularly predisposed to be gobsmacked into the past, even when I've put it the past to bed and built a beautiful life. It's true I'm sensitive and a very empathetic person. 

What gives? Is this genetics? Brain chemistry? Please give me some context for understanding why some people are more sensitive to PTSD and generally having a POV heavily colored by their past. ",26Feb2019,1
1,"I find myself getting strongly attached to people who provide physical care, in particular medical professionals. 

For example when I was 13 and I was taken to hospital in anaphylactic shock; I became attached to the paramedic who was in the ambulance with me as well as the first responder who arrived first at my house. I remembered them long afterwards, and often hoped I’d bump into them in the local area. 

I also recently became attached to a nurse who stitched a self harm cut.

I don’t tell them I am attached, but I find myself getting emotionally connected and almost pine to see them. Does anyone else get this way? ",26Feb2019,2
2,"I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia (July ‘18) and hallucinate Pokemon (sounds from the game — like ALL of the sounds), among other things as well of course. I‘m wondering if anyone else has hallucinations of Pokémon or of anything similar. And I was born in 1992. So I played Yellow, Silver, and Crystal a lot when I was 8-10 years old or so.",26Feb2019,1
3,"The quote was from “crazy is my superpower”. Written by AJ Mendez Brooks, 

For backstory, she had just talked about overdosing and her “rebirth” after the attempt.

“I know a lot of secure women and men who go to therapy. They don’t see it as an admission of a flaw. They see it as a luxury, serving their minds the way a massage spoils the body. Some of the happiest couples I know go to couples therapy weekly. And that’s why they are the happiest couples I know. Because they take time to check in with their emotions before a problem arises. If modern medicine isn’t your deal,then try homeopathic methods. Try meditation,anything. Just taking the time to put your mental health first,acknowledging that it deserves respect and care, and accepting help when you need it,can save your life. You are worth saving. And you are not alone.”

Just thought I’d share this as it stuck out to me when reading the book earlier today. Please take care of yourselves and much love.",26Feb2019,6
4,"Hey everyone, so I’ve had a lisp for while, but recently, I’ve realized how much it’s actually affecting me. It’s becoming a really big problem because I’m 15 and in high school so it really isn’t helping me socially.

I’ve driven myself crazy by looking how people pronounce their s’s and watching countless videos on YouTube. But it just isn’t working. 

People always say “Oh just go to speech therapy” and stuff like that. Although I reaaaaalllllyyy want to, I can’t, and for reasons I really don’t want to get in to.

I haven’t been TOO worried about it because i always thought that it would just go away as i got older. But I feel like it’s getting worse. And I read online that a lisp can be permanent if it sticks around for too long, and that scares the actual hell out of me.

I’m pretty sure I could rant all day about how it crumbles my self esteem, but that won’t help anything so I’m reaching out to the internet.

Please please please, if anyone has ANY advice or any website/video to point me towards, please do. The absolute last thing i want in my life is to be stuck with a lisp forever.",26Feb2019,1
5,"if i get very nervous or anxious about something (i.e. today i just kinda thought too hard about the possibility of my boyfriend cheating on me), my heart starts beating very hard and irregularly and i start shaking and sweating. i can typically calm myself down within a few minutes but the shaking lasts a while. what is this??? does anybody else experience this?

8,"Yesterday I had an absolute breakdown. I’ve been suffering from OCD and bipolar disorder for years now, and they’ve always taken their toll. Recently, I got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and I just felt like that was the nail in the coffin for me. I’ve been in a downward spiral ever since; I haven’t been working or taking care of myself in any fashion. I’m just tired of fighting. 

It all sort of came to a head yesterday where I completely lost it. I was unconsolable. In the midst of it all, I decided that I couldn’t be helped and that I was just going to “fake it until I make it”, so to speak. I decided I’d act like everything was fine until I couldn’t anymore, and that would be the end of me. 

To my utter shock, I’m actually feeling relatively good today. I ate a healthy meal, did a load of laundry, and even managed to take a shower. I know those are small things, but idk. I guess I just don’t feel like I’m sinking anymore.  ",26Feb2019,6
9,"I have no control over my life. I’ve wasted my youth. I’m 35m and my parents control everything. Nothing I do is ever good enough for them. Every time open up to them about something I want to do they act like I’m trying to win the lottery. I told them I want to do photography and they said it was a bad idea because “it’s too hard.” 

When I said I wanted to open a cafe someday, my mom said I’d have to wait until they passed before I could do that. 

I’ve wasted the last six years of my life because I got tired of fighting for control. I did what they said and I’ve got NOTHING to show for it. 

I don’t know how I’m going to get my life back! ",26Feb2019,1
10,"Hi, 24F here. So this is kind of a vent post, but I would also like to see if anyone has any advice towards the things I am about to talk about.

So basically, the only stable and good thing in my life right now is my relationship. You may be thinking that's a good thing, and of course it is, but I feel like the other aspects of my life are going to start to put a strain on my relationship.

Right now I'm on a long leave of absence from my job. I've been off since about the end of September. I work in a call center environment, which can be stressful, but the people I work with are amazing. Around September I started to get extremely anxious while trying to do my job, which is a live chat with important advertisers for a major social media platform. The episodes were getting so bad that I couldn't focus on anything and my work quality suffered. By the end of the month I was having daily panic attacks just thinking of going to work. I called in ""sick"" a lot. Like, thrice a week sometimes. I got to a point where I figured it was better if I just go on leave until I could get a hold of myself.

Fast forward to February, I have been out of work this whole time (still getting income but it's gone from 100% to 60%) and still waiting on a call from a long term psychiatrist so I can finally return. I have had multiple one session assessments from multiple counselors, doctors, and psychs, and they all say the same thing: there is something wrong but we have to wait. The wait list in my province is HUGE, and the average wait is 6 months. I have tried group therapy which has a smaller wait, but it's really not for me. 

I'm in a loving relationship with a very supportive girlfriend, and have been since about October. She's my rock. Especially right now, because my best friend has stopped talking to me. Sometimes it's impossible for me to get out of bed, and on one of these days, my friend asked me to go to the hospital with her. She had hit her head pretty hard the other day and she had yet to go to the doctor. It happened to be a holiday so only the emergency room was open, and of course, packed. I was already really in my head today, and being in a crowded ER with a bunch of sick people for hours while we waited just put me over the top. I told her I couldn't come. She seemed to be okay with it, because she was asking me just because she didn't want to go alone (she also has high anxiety). A couple days later (after a couple checking in texts from me, without a response) she suddenly texts me that she is very angry with me and can't rely on me. I apologized and explained what happened but she's right. I am unreliable. I'm unreliable because of this stupid illness. It's in almost full control right now, and in the past I've been able to fight it. I feel like it gets stronger every time, until I lose every time.

I also have a huge problem cleaning. I love having a nice clean house. I'm too depressed to clean, so my place is a sty. I can't even look at it. When I do, I get panicky. I've tried to clean in baby steps (like one thing a day) but it just gets worse because I make a mess faster than I can clean. It makes me hate myself further.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My job, finances, mental health, friendships, and basically everything else is falling apart, and I've been having to completely lean on my girlfriend so I don't kill myself or something. Sorry if this didn't make sense I just needed to say it.",26Feb2019,1
11,"I don't know where to begin. I work at a decently sized target not too big or too small. My co workers absolutely adore me. I live life doing what makes me happy and Loving any time I can. Recently though thing's have been so hard. I try my best everyday to make a fool out of myself because it's fun and it makes people laugh even in my work environment my manager's and co worker's are great people! Up until corporate decided to change the way we do literally everything which was a shame because the old way was so efficient I couldn't even think of a way to improve it because it was so flawless! That's not why I am here though.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said I do my best to put smile's on people's faces and make everyday for every one new and full of life. My manager's honor me with promotion offer's and everybody want's me to be in their work center all the time. When I am not showing up at a party everyone's blowing up my phone and it makes me happy that so many people want me around it makes me feel loved and appreciated which is all I ever want from anyone. Just yesterday my personal manager said I was her favorite out of the rest and again it makes me feel good to be wanted everywhere. You can call me an attention whore but it just feel's so great to have all this attention by just being me and doing what I want to do everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently though my relationship with my closest friends has degraded and it's heartbreaking. I used to log on to my computer everyday so excited to play a new game with them. I know guy's make fun of each other for fun but most of the time I'm just trying to enjoy myself and the jokes are just really annoying after a while. Couple of day's ago I left the group chat with them because of recent event's. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have just gotten out of a toxic relationship with my ex. I gave her everything I was. I had met her on tinder and I would hang out with her and her family for a while. I am not a big social media person but she was so I deleted my old outdated facebook and created one with my personality all over it fo her. After a while of hanging out with her I decided to propose to her and make us facebook official. I sat outside waiting for an hour for her to get home and when she did I walked up to the driver door got on my knees and proposed to her with a ring pop and gave her favorite care bear to her. Only to be laughed at and called stupid. Then she tell's everybody how stupid I am. After a while she started making break up threat's and wouldn't even let me hug her or let me tell her I love her without shoving e into a wall. After when I'm upstairs crying about it she proceeds to tell me that I am so dramatic and why she broke up with her ex. which by the way she would inform me of a new ex every day. I even bought us bracelets that vibrate each other when tapped and I just put forth so much effort to Love her and she eventually started ignoring me for 3 day's and then text's me ""I can't pretend everything is okay"" After accusing ME of cheating and lying!

&amp;#x200B;

During our relationship my childhood best friend my cat had died and that was heartbreaking and I still cannot get over it  on top of my Dad and Grandfather going to the hospital every week now. Some how And I credit God with this I still can keep a smile and putting smiles on people's faces everyday. So with my cat being gone and my ex leaving me with hugless arm's I decided to get a synthetic companion as sort of an adult stuffed animal. It's a realistic sex doll with heating that I would like to use for cuddling so I've got something physical to hold onto after everything that's happened to me. Everyone around me is being so kind and not judging me for this except for my closest friend's who did nothing but judge and didn't want to hear anything about it. I am still able to put smile's on people's faces but I am starting to feel so alone and I do not know what I can do anymore. On top of all of this I had the most awful day at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I go in prepared to my duties and my boss enlightens me on a new strategy that she want's me to try so I get in and get to work and my older coworker is just so cranky today and I'm just trying to mind my business and get my work done. Meanwhile she is just criticizing on how I am doing thing's differently and I explain to her I am doing as I was instructed only for her to doubt me. I just shrug it off and continue to do me and she is finding every way to yell at me accusing me of doing something for 5 min. for something I didn't do. Then the real culprit revealed herself and then she apologizes to me and everything's cool it had been rough so far but I think to myself I can get through it. and for 2 hours she is just whining and bitching in an amount I didn't know she was capable of. and it's just upsetting for me. Then she start's yelling at me and threatening to leave work if I keep it up which I don't why that is considered a threat but I could tell my higher up boss was getting mad at the way she was acting so she told me to just do thing's another way.

&amp;#x200B;

I do my job the way my manager want's it to be done and I am constantly getting bitched at by coworker's like her who don't do anything all day but stay in one area doing the same thing while I am everywhere carrying the place on my back trying to assist other co worker's and filling out paperwork almost all day just running around the place doing tasks in every work center. meanwhile coworker's who do one thing criticize me on how I am doing a simple task that doesn't matter if it's done right.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do anymore. I do everything right mean while staying true to myself and people constantly find way's to hurt me. and humiliate me in way's I don't want to be humiliated and it's just so mentally exhausting. I just don't know what to do about my closest friends and I don't understand why people try to hurt me when I am not doing anything to hurt them. A handful of people give me so much attitude despite the amount of politeness I return to them. I am just confused when people accuse me of doing stuff I didn't do. I literally sit there trying to understand the weight of what they accuse me of and I got nothing to say because I have no knowledge of it.

16,"I live far from home at university. Late at night, when all the phones are unmanned, my parents are asleep, and nobody can hear my pain of depression and insomnia, I have no idea what to do. I start hurting myself banging on things and crying, until it feels like I'm going to explode or some kind of release or conclusion is imminent, but nothing ever happens. In these moments ifeel totally alone and suicidal, but I know I would never kill myself because of what it would do to my very loving parents. In these moments, I feel an urge to go out of my lonely flat and just wreak some sort of havoc; trashing anything, running through the city naked, fighting people. I have no idea why. I've almost acted on this a few times as this is a nightly feeling of depression for me when I can't sleep (every night). I've been outside at 4am staring at cars driving past and just wondering what would happen should one of the drivers stop and interact with me. I'm in such pain and just want someone to feel it, when there's nobody I can speak to. Can anyone empathize with this feeling of Wanting to cause public havoc/ get very public attention.

19,"I'm 22M hes 21M. we met at the gym. we are not gym buddies but sometimes we are there same time so we talk. weve been friends for months now. we've always been nice to each other

However, one thing  I've noticed are his mood swings. something I've noticed since ive seen him in the gym (before we started talking). On some days he is in a good mood and is sociable but on some days, hes cold and wont reply much. This november, the latter has been more frequent. Id get scanty replies be it through text or face to face, and I dont think anyone would like that. Id ask if hes ok and hed say the generic response ""Im fine""

He has never shown any signs that he does not like me. as a matter of fact, its the opposite (as a friend).

*  If we havent seen each other in a week and then we do, hed say something like ""its good to see you i havent seen you in a while.'

*  On some occasion he seems happy to see me and looks upset when i leave. He also shows moderate forms of affection (see below)

* We went from fist bumps to handshakes to those brohug handshakes (which he was the first to start doing). Mid november on one occasion, he pat me on the waist when he said goodbye to me. That might seem like a small matter...but its a bit 'romantic' for a dude to do that to another - although im not bothered by it. And definitely you wont do that to someone you dont like

From mid november onwards he has been a bit cold and his bad days were more frequent. hed  reply me with one word up front and gets annoyed when i try talking to him. at one point he even snapped when i asked a question. He had gone sour with me all of a sudden.

I confronted him through text that eventhough i apologized for the question, i shouldve recieved one for being snapped at. and since he has no interest in talking to me lately, i wont be talking to him. i got no response.

A week+ later I realize everyone makes mistakes and have bad days, and I shouldnt retaliate at the first mistake especially since he has been nice to me in the past. i send an apology for retaliating (eventhough i deserve one) because i dont want to make things worse for him. still no response.

Eventually I meet him at the gym and we do that brohug thing...as if weve moved forward. I ask to talk to him after hes done working out and he said ok. He didnt. He went straight home and sent me a text saying he doesnt want to talk and goes to the gym just to workout and only that (not to talk).

Seeing how we might not talk anymore, i told him how i felt. How Ive always felt like hes going through something because i noticed the mood swings. told him he can still talk to me if he needs someone to talk to, and if he doesnt want to talk to me, talk to someone, because bottling things are bad.

No response also. We havent blocked each other. and at no point have we attacked each other personally. Im a bit worried about his wellbeing and quite upset that I may have lost a friend. My fear is that stress and anxiety (atleast) are getting to him.

Eventually we bumped into each other at christmas day and we wished each other a merry christmas. However, the rest of the day he avoided eye contact and the bad vibes were still there.

Three weeks afterwards we bump i to each other and this time he initiates. He waves at me from a far, and sooner he actually came up to me and started having a convo. It was a good convo, good vibes.

A few weeks later (havent seen him since ☝🏼) I follow him on his unprivate instagram but no follow back.

Im utterly confused at his behaviour. Does he want to be friends or not? Furthermore I am leaving the state soon (leaving Aussie, for a very long time) and I have not seen him since.

Three days before today, I saw him again and we had basic small talk. He seemed really off. I want to say he seemed down and depressed but I feel like I might be biased.

I have a strong urge to text him asking if hes ok. But I really feel unwelcomed to do so - it’d be humiliating if i get no response or another one word response. But another part of me thinks “how worse can this get?”


He has mentioned his family has it difficult sometimes because they have so much things to pay (insurances, their schooling and etc) and i think he might be struggling. He has also just finished college (which he said is difficult to pay for). 2 weeks after finishing college and hes already frustrated about having to find work (he seems to really need it).

I dont know if that is enough to assume someone is having a hard time. finances are a big thing. can these (and perhaps some other stuff) be affecting his behaviour? I am worried...although we may never speak to each other again.",26Feb2019,1
20,"At work, I’m usually recognized as a hard worker. I get things done when needed but also like to have fun, and make sure everyone is happy. 

In August of 2016, I had a new co worker who eventually became my boss. She absolutely hated most people, but mostly me. 1) I was new 2) I was 18. She constantly would tell me how worthless I was to the organization, and where I work is contract based. If I decided I wanted to stay, she “barred” me from this organization. Thankfully, this did not go through the second person needed to approve it so I was not barred for very long. 

At first, I truly did believe I was worthless. Every fuck up I did I would blame myself, and eventually just decided I deserved anything harsh that came my way. She was extremely homophobic, and would constantly point that out. Nothing was done about her comments. She would actively go around telling everyone how worthless I and a few others were, and that she wished she was never assigned to lead “such terrible people”. This was constant until the day she left. 

The day she was leaving, I got a friend request from her on Facebook. I was furious. Because I finally figured out what this bitch wanted, and it was control. She wanted to be the top and didn’t care who she brought down, she had no feelings for anyone else at all. Her going away, she thought it was rude nobody bought her meal, after we all put in at least $20-50 for her plaque she didn’t deserve. 

I said after the day she left, I would never be that unhappy again. But her words still linger. I still feel way worse when I mess up a tiny task than I would have before, I still have a couple months left here and I feel like I should at least enjoy it but I don’t. I feel like she tarnished perfectly good references I could of had by absolutely trashing mine and others names. I feel like she is the reason I am not continuing with this organization. And I truly hate that she has that effect on me, and I’m unsure of how to get out of that mindset that I’m a “worthless employee”.",26Feb2019,1
21,"Last night I had another dream about my parents. In my dream, I was screaming at my mom, throwing things at her and my dad and saying all sorts of crazy things. At first I was upset then unbelievably angry and then finally, I woke up, and felt very anxious and scared and couldn’t go back to sleep.

Just a little info about me: I’m 23 and I moved across the country from home (intentionally) and am lucky to have a really good, well paying job. I struggle a lot with letting people into my life and generally being avoidant (ignoring texts, ghosting people, not really letting myself emotionally connect). I also find that I have regular periods of depression and generally feel a lack of purpose in life.  At the same time I’m extremely sensitive and feel emotions very strongly and always have.  But somehow I’ve made many emotions “off limits” and won’t let myself listen to music or watch movies that cause them. 

Going back to the dream - In the last month or so, I had a breakdown about the aforementioned mental struggles.  

It’s hard to explain concisely, but basically my family has barely reached out to me at all for the last couple months and I got really upset because this is how it’s been since I moved out.  It feels like they only reach out if they need something from me or if they feel anxious about our relationship and want to get clear that it’s okay. 

But otherwise, I never get calls or check ins. Ever. And when I make an effort, I sense that they have a general lack of interest in the things in my life (sometimes they even invalidate me because I am “lucky to have a good job”). Yet I always listen to their issues if they have any. 

After weeks of not hearing from them, I got extremely upset and felt very, very lonely and invisible. And I realized that this didn’t just start when I moved out - my parents have always been emotionally absent.  

Example: When I was young, my mom forced me to play sports even though I didn’t want to. When I would protest, she would tell me I was “being ridiculous” and that “all boys play sports”.  There were even times when I was young when I would just cry at my games and she’d get angry and yell at me and punish me in some way.  She’d also go on about how she couldn’t wait for me to get older so she could watch me play sports.  It’s like she didn’t see or care that I hated it.  This is just one of countless examples growing up.  On top of this, looking back, I realize that I made so many efforts to get them to “notice me” and at some point, I “accepted” that it wasn’t going to happen.

But now I think I’ve carried this into my adult life and now I have such a hard time connecting with people.  Sometimes I feel fine and am able to connect with my friends here, but other times (like today after my dream), I feel so very very empty and alone and scared, honestly.  Very scared. 

Anyways, I’m trying to find a therapist. Has anyone here ever had this experience? What can I do? I have been working on being more emotionally available, self soothing, and trying to be more authentic with people. But some days it’s so hard. I’m thankful to have a couple of really good friends who have been trying to support me through some of this.

Also, just typing this out has brought me to tears again honestly. This sucks so much. 

Thanks for any input you can provide ",26Feb2019,1
22,"I am someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager (currently in my mid 30s). I have had them mostly under control for the last 5 or 6 years, but my life has completely changed over the last 6 months.

In August my girlfriend and our dog moved back to her mom's place after living together for 2 years. It was mutual, things weren't going well, but we both loved each other and it was really hard. I held onto our apartment as long as I could, but it got too expensive and I had to move at the beginning of February. Giving up our home was also very hard.

2 days after I moved into my new apartment, I unexpectedly lost my job due to a coworker targeting me and getting me fired. I did absolutely nothing to deserve this. This sent me spiralling. I signed a 12 month lease on an expensive apartment due to the money I was making at this job. I won't find another job that makes close to that, which means I won't be able to afford my apartment. 

I have been so overwhelmed since I lost my job, thinking about having to find another job, sublet or assign the apartment to someone else, or breaking my lease, and having to move again. I have lost everything in my life that gave me any sense of stability, certainly, familiarity, and security. My depression and anxiety have hit me like a ton of bricks, and I am terrified.",26Feb2019,3
23,"Okay so to be straight up about 2 months ago I made a throwaway account cause I didn’t want to post it on this one, but anyway I thought at the time I had schizophrenia but I’ve been doing more research and looking at my behavior and things that have happened to me and stuff and believe I might have a bipolar disorder,

A little bit about me, I’m 14, 15 in a few months if that’s needed but yeah I don’t have a psychiatrist yet, and I’ve been going to therapy and have had about 4 or 5 appointments so far and about to have another on the 27th and I don’t know what to do, should I tell him I think I have it cause I’ve only realized today my symptoms are like really close to the disorder, 

I was talking to a friend (I talk to them about this stuff cause they’ve been to therapy) and brought up that it may be bipolar disorder and they agreed as well that my symptoms are super close to it as well, but anyway yeah, I unknowingly told my therapist symptoms I have. 

So yeah um that’s about it ",26Feb2019,1
24,"I'm a university student and my regular therapist left our campus to get a new job across the country. While I'm really excited for her, this means I'll have to get a new therapist. While I was very comfortable with my former therapist, I was never really able to being up the fact that I've been having ongoing and constant (as in every day) suicidal ideation. I feel like it's incredibly important to bring this up, yet I'm unsure of how to approach this topic with a new therapist, or anyone at all.

25,"Long story short, my SO invited me over to play smash with his friends (with one of whom I've had bad experiences).  I usually dont play as I SUCK at smash. I thought, this is an opportunity to try to play the game and get along with someone I don't particularly care for --because he does. Because my SO loves to play and the guy I don't like is his friend.

Well there weren't enough controllers... NBD. I'll sit this one out and play the next one.  Then they played another. Still NBD I'll get a turn in a bit.  I was there an hour before I decided to leave. 

No one offered to let me play. As a matter of fact, no body even spoke to me while they talked amongst themselves.  I sat there with nothing to say and nothing to do feeling excluded and feeling like the tag-along no one really cares is there. 

I told my SO ""I think I'm gonna bounce"" he didn't ask why. He didn't protest. He sure as sh*t didn't ask me to play. A few minutes later he asked ""are you leaving?""

It def hurt my feelings but I'm not angry.  I'm not out to make this about me but I wasn't really sure how to handle the situation. I didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable or make my SO think I was angry by just leaving but spending my time sitting outside the group and feeling excluded is a waste and it's unfair.

Maybe I should accept that his friends and smash just aren't meant for me.  It certainly doesn't feel good not to be accepted as one of da boizz but I think I'll live.",26Feb2019,1
26,"I've always struggled with depression, but it's been getting a lot worse recently, to the point where I'm not really feeling safe, due to a big reason. A large degree of my mental health problems come from being really isolated and quite literally not knowing any people in real life who live in my city, as all my friends moved away. I won't go too into detail about things I've been diagnosed with and what not, but largely as long as I have the option to spend time with people I enjoy the company of, and who understand me (like my friends whenever I travel to visit them), I feel much better than when I'm alone.

Due to the smallish nature of the city I live in though, I'm having an extreme amount of trouble actually meeting anyone who I have anything in common with, and it's kind of dragging me into a really dark place. I've tried medication, counseling, and therapy, but none of it actually does anything for me because I'm still alone at the end of it all.

Which brings me to this question. Is it deceptive or immoral to seek out group therapy solely with the intention of using it to make friends who understand how I feel and might have stuff in common with me, rather than the actual therapy itself? I'm out of other ideas.",26Feb2019,1
27,"To preface this, I'm a 14 year old girl. This has been happening to me a few times a week or several years, but it's been getting worse lately. Sorry if there's a problem with the format, I'm on mobile (and sorry it's so long!!)

Sometimes, at night, I'll feel terrified all of a sudden. It gets hard to breathe, I get really cold or hot (it depends), and I get a feeling like I am being watched and that someone is behind me. I can get really imaginative with this, which isn't really a good thing. One night someone is looking at me through the window, another night someone is standing right behind me with a knife inches away from me. There's no reason why I think stuff like this is going on, I have never been stalked or attacked or anything. 

Normally, this happens when I am in bed and I can't sleep. When it does happen, there's a voice in my head that tells me what to do in order to make the feeling go away. Typically it's something alone the lines of ""face the wall, close your eyes tight, tap 26 times and don't move or you'll be killed"". 

Today, it was dark out and I had to go into my basement to put laundry in the dryer. As soon as I got down there, I got the feeling but worse. I had to back against a wall and tap my foot 5 times but that didn't help. I decided to just do my laundry because I was probably just imagining things but I got so scared I could barely breathe or stop looking behind myself. 

Is this normal? What could be causing it, and how do I stop it? ",26Feb2019,1

29,"I posted something similar on r/Aspergers but I thought I'd try here too.

I've been wanting to move out since I was 14 because of my parents, and they're straight up refusing to help me. My mother knows that if I leave, she'll be required to disown me according to her religion and then she won't be able to try to force me back in.

The main thing I struggle with is the enormity of the task and doing it alone. I've tried making lists of everything I need to research and get in order, but then I have so many lists to make that it's daunting and I never do it.

Living with my parents has caused a huge amount of mental health problems and I can't fix them while I'm still in that environment, but I never get better because I'm stuck in my current situation. I have major issues with executive dysfunction, depression and exhaustion along with the fact I can't go home if things don't work out.

I tried reaching out to my local religious community but they feel that I should try to make peace with my mother and don't understand why she's so opposed instead of jumping ship. So I basically have no help unless I somehow manage to get myself established with a local community in my country that can help.

If you moved out, how did you prepare? What challenges did you face that were caused, or made more difficult, by mental illness? Or did none of you ever move out and I'm not going to escape these people until I die?",26Feb2019,1

34,"First some backstory. I've always been extremely self conscious. Even in 3rd grade I remember talking to teacher about how much I hate myself (10th grade now). I've felt terrible about myself for as long as I can remember. I used to think there was a possibility that other people could read my thoughts, so I would constantly try to think in a ""cool"" way. I think that's what really messed me up. I've really stopped caring about what other people think for the most part recently and I've noticed it still feels like I think and speak through a filter. In my head it feels like I think more and different thoughts that I'm consciously aware of, and not just normal subconscious thoughts but stuff that I should be consciously aware of. Like I already said before, I think this is due to constantly trying to suppress my own thoughts, interests, and emotions almost 24/7 for at least 5 years. Is it possible I've built up a subconscious habit of not being myself and I don't even know about it, because that's exactly what it feels like in my head. Also, I've had 1 day where I acted completely different from how I normally act however it didn't feel like I was thinking through a filter, the thoughts in my head flowed smoothly from one to the other and my speech was natural, I never feel like that, even when I'm alone.

35,"I have an 84 year old grandmother that I assist my mother with taking care of.  She lives in her own world most of the time. Decades ago, supposedly some doctor or psychiatrist or something diagnosed her as paranoid schizophrenic with very high anxiety. I say supposedly because my mother told me that and she apparently heard that from her mother (my grandmother) decades ago.

Honestly, my grandmother seems to have been miserable from the time she was a kid to present. She hates everyone, has always been argumentative, bull-headed and always wanted to do things her way. That way always seemed to be the wrong way, whether opening a simple package of something or living life in general. Her huge list of symptoms:

* Very hard to get along with most of the time. She hates everyone. She can't turn on the TV without hurling racial slurs, bashing on news people, talking about their outward appearance and such. If you don't want to listen to her nonsense and tell her, she'll get offended and then act like you're somehow attacking her or ""arguing with her"" when really it is her. 
*  She constantly makes up lies about family members, neighbors, strangers, etc. She adds her own twist to news stories and is just an absolute pack of lies. She'll start it off with, ""The newspaper said..."" or ""They said on TV that...""  and they absolutely did not. No idea why she does this. 
* For at least half of her life, she has been unable to do basic tasks properly. I mean stuff like washing dishes. She used to sit for various old people in their homes and would get complaints from their families that she didn't wash the dishes properly, they were all greasy, had food stuck on, etc. She does that to this day with dishes, utensils and even the very cups she drinks out of. Unable to open packages the right way. She'll just tear a big hole in it as if a rat chewed it open. She seems to have been unable to perform simple tasks for a lot of her life. No idea why. When she goes to the bathroom, she wants to leave the light off and the door halfway open while sitting on the toilet. Obviously, that's a big problem. Her reason? ""I'm just going to be in here for a minute. I was coming right out.""  Same for public bathrooms. 
* Possessions. She never owned her own home. She had 3 children and raised them very poorly, moving from apartment to apartment after not paying the rent and basically about to be kicked out all of the time. They changed schools sometimes every year. She worked various jobs that made decent money, but honestly just didn't seem to have sense enough to know what to do with it. She would get a car from a car lot and when it needed basic repairs (e.g. brakes after a certain amount of time), she'd take the car back to the car lot and ""get another one"" instead of fixing it. When it needed something, she'd do the same thing. She has ""ran out of gas"" a ridiculous amount of times in her life. 
* Very odd stories from her childhood. A lot of them don't make sense, have odd events and such. 
* Connects unrelated events. She could see some comics sitting on a car in a random parking lot and will remember back 10-20 years ago when some person she knew joked with her, ""See you in the funny pages.""  She'll say they knew she was going to pass by and put it there as a joke for her. 
* Called the bomb squad out to the neighbor's house one time because she said somebody told her a bomb would go off in xx minutes. Thankfully, they didn't break their door down. She heard it raining hard and said there was an ""awful crackling sound"" and said it was ""something about to blow up.""  
* She is miserable. Has no compassion for anything or anyone. Not kids, not adults, not animals. She got dogs for her young kids earlier in life and they basically let the dog die from whatever instead of treating it. Her solution was to ""keep it until it died and get another one.""  Just like with cars.
* Paces the floor from the living room to dining room to kitchen looking out of the window in each room every 2-3 minutes. I have no idea how many hundreds of times per day she does this. There are times at night where she literally jumps up every 1-2 minutes and it is dark outside with nothing to see, but it is like she's watching the neighbors. No idea why. She also wants to sleep with the curtains open next to her bed all night, probably so she can jump up and look out. Sometimes she says she hears ""screams"" or ""footsteps"" and goes tearing to the window.
* Is convinced that a man from two houses down has set up speakers/microphones throughout the neighborhood and plays various ""tapes"" (sounds of death, grinding sounds, loud music, sexual talk, etc.) to disturb her and the neighborhood. Whoever the ""guy"" was (if there even was one), he moved decades ago. 
* Sometimes you can talk to her and she just has this blank stare. She'll repeat the last word that you emphasized to her almost in a mocking way and then she still didn't get what you just said to her or asked her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of this stuff...I have a hard time believing it is just schizophrenia only. She's ""there"" enough to refuse help physically, but sure does need it mentally. Haven't been able to get her help, even when she filed false police reports, called the bomb squad out and got a ridiculous response, etc. They wouldn't take her. Some sort of psychosis mixed with schizophrenia and super high anxiety or something? There are times when she can't sit down and has to stand up to watch tv, 2-3 feet from it like it can't tell her stories quickly enough. ",26Feb2019,1
36,"I'm wondering what my options are for finding appropriate mental health treatment for my sister. I had to take her to the hospital where she was treated for psychosis for about a week then discharged to her own care because family did not feel as though she was safe to leave and no one was made aware when exactly she would be discharged. Two days later she took a bottle of pills with alcohol in a suicide attempt. After this attempt she was discharged from the hospital in less than 24 hours and is still very paranoid and delusional but I'm not sure what her risk is for further suicide attempts as she has not been reaching out to me since I'm now part of her delusions and she believes that I'm out to get her. I'm just not sure what my options are as far as getting her treatment because she is an adult. She is unable to work now, obviously hasn't been eating, and hasnt been attending to her hygiene/other ADLs. Any suggestions on how I should help her from here? She lives in Utah, not sure if that makes difference on legal options. I'm getting frustrated the hospital keeps letting her go before she is actually stabilized. ",26Feb2019,3
37,I’ve been developing depression ever since I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder a year ago and I am not sure what to. My anxiety has been getting worse ever since my parents got divorced and their newfound relationships have not been making it any better. Ever since my second semester of community college started up my attention in class has been very lackluster because I am starting to not see the point in all of this. I stress over my grades so much because I believe it is the only thing that can get me away from my home the soonest. The only thing I really do is play games on my computer all day and occasionally study but that is not helping out my grades at all. I am just afraid of the near future and how I might fail all of my classes because I just can’t find the inspiration to give them attention anymore. I wish that I just didn’t hate myself so much and I could do good in school so I can get out of my terrible living situation.

Also I’ve been a bit hornier than usual and I’m never horny while hypomanic

39,"We are nothing but empty machines following our genetic programming and our environment programming. We have no self. It is a lie. I tried so hard to find counter arguments to this but found none. It is the truth. We are nothing but soulless copycats that just copy what other biological machines do. We have no originality. We just copy. Originality is also a lie. We copy behaviors from our parents and friends. We do not originate. We are nothing.

This realization leaves me feeling nothing but hollow emptiness. I don't know how or why to bother continue existing in this world. I do not really exist. I'm a just a machine just like everyone else. I have been near emotionless for many years. The only time I feel something more than a slight ring of emotion is when I take Ambien at night to help me sleep. For some reason Ambien gives feelings back to me and it feels good but I can't abuse medicine that is meant to make me fall asleep.

Even if I had my feelings back it would not help me cope with the illusion of the self. I would still be a hollow machine following programming. And as for individuality, as I said nothing we do is original. We need other biological machines to survive. No man is an island. And so we conform to society and relationships and lose ourselves in them. We are basically a hive mind. We don't exist as individuals, we are components to a superorganism known as humanity.

40,"I’m currently in my final semester of and English Education Masters program and last week I was on break so I went to Atlanta to visit my girlfriend. My program requires two student teaching placements and the school I’m in right now I find to be very toxic as does the other student teacher across the hall from me. I’ve always been a melancholy person and an anxious one although I’ve never been diagnosed with anything and I do struggle with suicide ideation.

So last week, in Atlanta Saturday to Monday I felt good, but when Tuesday rolled around I started to feel anxious, soon I found that had no appetite, couldn’t sleep, and couldn’t focus. I began disassociating and didn’t eat or really do anything without substantial prodding my girlfriend for 3 days. She got me to walk around the mall a couple of times and play Pokémon Go and that did make me feel a little better but the feeling always returned. On top of this, I couldn’t stop crying at random times.

When I got home I decided to speak to my friends stepdad who is a pastor and he pointed out to me that I’m finishing a program I don’t like, don’t really want to be employed in(this is back up, I’m a writer), he also said he’s observed that I can be manic, and that I have just enough type A personality in me to feel like I’m failing when I’m not doing great instead of just okay. While I do feel a little better now, I feel a bit as if I’m waking around in a fog. However,  I feel very fragile as if I could fall apart at any moment. He also pointed that I bring guilt to a lot of things in my life like when I’m relaxing my brain is always saying that “You should be working,” or while my girlfriend pays the majority of bills and she chooses to because she helps me have time to write I feel guilty about this and like I should be working more to help out. He said that while therapy might help, as I’m trying to make it through the last 10 weeks of this program I’d probably feel guilty sitting in therapy “wasting time”, and medication would take too long to work. He suggested more physical activities, less isolation, and meeting with him every once and a while just to talk. 

I know this is a long post but I’m just interested to see if people have any ideas of how to cope or proceed so I can survive the rest of this program.",26Feb2019,5

44,"I'm sorry in advance for all of this stuff. I just really need opinions on my current state of mind.

Everything is dull. To me, at least. I find no enjoyment in anything, and have been beginning to do... things for just a smidge of a feeling. More on that later. I've been raised in the mentality of, if you can't talk about mental health to your parents, just kill yourself. My family life is semi-okay, with some lashing outs from my mother and stepfather because life is stressful, and I've been raised to be okay with that. But now, I'm not okay. At all.

I have a couple hobbies, some of them being singing, dancing on occasion, drawing, and physical sports like ice hockey and lacrosse. Besides the sports, everything is dull. I can't find a reason to get up in the morning. I've forgotten how to laugh for real, not just that fake laugh you do when you want everyone else to think you're okay.

Things I usually loved, like drawing, are now a thing I do for other people's pleasure. Looking happy is now my hobby. The eye crinkle? Got it. The slight snort? Nailed it. The over-showing of teeth? Mastered. But, again, no enjoyment. Gaming? Dull. School? Duller. Family? So monochrome gray that a mime would be jealous.

Now onto the... Things. I've been slicing my inner lip open with a switchblade my father (not stepfather) gave me when I was young. Cutting into my chest words I believe I'll never be is a thing too. Beautiful? Right breast. Smart? Sternum region. Loved? Collarbone. Scarves have become my new best friend. The mirror, my new friend. They give me a sense of reality I guess I haven't realised yet.

Pain is something I thought I'd never turn to. I've seen all of the people on YT who share their experiences. They are similar, yet different. That's the basis of the human mind, is it not? My individuality is slipping, my morals out the window, and my reasoning loosely slung on my back in a burlap sack.

46,"Hey Reddit, just a fair bit of warning here. I'm letting all my emotional baggage out on this one. It's alot, but maybe not comparitively to some. It's really exactly what it sounds like. I didn't remember why I put my 3ds away for a while, so I open it up and boot up Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Big mistake. Let me tell you, if you've never played an animal crossing game: That music is powerful. Just one minute of the 9 PM theme was enough for me to put it down and start bawling my eyes out. About everything, and all my emotional baggage just spills out onto myself. I wished I could turn back the clock, back to where the only thing I had to worry about was waking up as early as I could on Saturday morning to get onto the family desktop and log into Hypixel. Back before my parents get divorced, back when my grades were good, back when I had recess, cub scouts, Chuggaconroy, Old School Versus, hell, even all the way back to watching SpongeBob DVDs in the backseat of my mom's minivan! But most of all, back when I still had my brother. One of three siblings, actually. Figured this was the only place on Reddit and unpack some of this stuff without scaring people away and making them super uncomfortable, so I'm just gonna let it out. My brother hung himself on December 8th, 2017. Because of this, my mother and I quit the boy scouts, because it was just too much emotionally to handle that he wouldn't be showing up to the meetings again. Ever. My dad cries excessively every morning, and I can never forget the screams that I heard that night. It may not seem like much compared to some people, but very much still.  I came to this SubReddit to say this because I need to ask 2 questions about what just happened.

1. What can you classify that as, cause I'm not sure whether to call it a panic attack, mental breakdown, I dont know?

2. What do I do with my 3DS now? There are so many memories attached to it. It seems wrong to not play with it ever again, but I don't think I can really play the thing without having it all spill out again.

50,"Yo, so I’m a first year college student who’s still kinda getting used to everything that comes with university. I was hoping you could give me some advice on how you handled a situation similar to the one I’m in.

Essentially, I’m working 11+ hours a week, am a STEM double major, and have a relatively demanding social life. Realistically, I should have next to no free time if I want to be healthy/successful, but as a (self proclaimed) introvert, constant social interaction and exposure to stimulus flips the switch that makes me want to isolate and take time to recharge. However, I don’t have much time to do this, so I involuntarily (low willpower) eat away at the time I should be using to study, sleep, etc.

The stress and relative dip in mental stability due to this unhealthy and irresponsible lifestyle causes me to make poor decisions in personal life. (Ie, I’ve been pulled aside by managers to discuss poor work performance, and a close friend of mine’s expressed concern that I haven’t been spending too much time with him. (I’ve also been falling behind on course content and hitting mental blocks when it comes to assignments))

Any ideas on how I can address the dip in willpower? I’m worried that continuing like this will lead to a general increase in depression/anxiety.",26Feb2019,1
51,"Hi guys! I am working on coming up with a list ideas on how my college campus could better support students when mental illness in hopes of creating some lasting change on campus. Some ideas I have had so far are: better supporting suicidal students with transition plans so that school work doesn’t prevent students from seeking needed treatment, incorporating mental health education into a univ 101 course, posting crisis resource information on every floor of every residence hall, offering group therapy or peer led support groups in the evening to better fit students schedules...what are something you campus does (did) that you love? What are somethings you wish your campus would have done differently?",26Feb2019,14
52,"This is a bit unconventional but here goes. Part of the reason I’m posting this is because of reddit posts that I’ve read people describing their own experiences and in some cases, where they didn’t make it. I just simply wanted to share what it was like personally to go through hell and back.

I’ll start off by saying that I never actually posted with my current account and used throwaways because I didn’t want anyone gazing into how I felt and felt ashamed and defeated. While I had a history of OCD, I didn’t have any symptoms for a good 7 Years until I moved into college, perhaps the catalyst of my downfall at the time. Last semester was my first year away from home ever and as a person who shamelessly admits being very introverted and practically spent every weekend and consciously avoided gatherings and meet ups really enjoyed staying at home and all its familiarity and comforts including family and my own room. However, my mind went into a giant shock and OCD came out of its hibernation during this period and had full grasp of me, mercilessly submerging my head underwater.

Like in most cases of standard freshman homesickness, I believed that it was simply just homesicknesses but it amalgamated into something much more nastier involving the OCD and other personal issues I’m not QUITE comfortable sharing even now just because of the degree of discomfort and writhing it costed me. However, I will mention that when it didn’t go away for months and no improvements were shown (in fact, it only got much much worse) I realized that this was definitely not regular homesickness. The thing is, our school and just I guess the US in general really doesn’t have terrific sources for mental health. You’re either stuck in queue for a visit with the school counselors (I even sought out the emergency crisis center multiple times and none of those helped because I needed help NOW) or go out of your way to appoint with an off-branch center (it was a bitch having to find a ride and appointments and just too much to handle especially in my condition). 

I see that many people describe themselves as being a rotting shell of yourself and I couldn’t find a more accurate way to depict this. It was amazingly cruel how bad mental health can destroy you. Never in my life have I denied my favorite foods or any food at all (I am a proud foodie). It was frightening how something like food was undetected and even considered throw-up-inducing. I went days without eating or simply having a piece of stale bread for the whole day and felt so weak and tired all the time but weirdly, I was NOT hungry. I was too depressed to even feel hunger. Even mobile games I played religiously absolutely appalled me and I was there thinking that my condition was irreversible and at the time, I genuinely and truly from the bottom of my heart saw no future of me recovering and thought I’d have to live with it forever. 

My brain clouded up and I couldn’t tell if it wasn’t homesickness, my OCD, or just a really fucked up curse from who knows where out to get me. It was truly a scary time when I literally couldn’t stomach or enjoy anything and all my days spent at college involved crying, calling for hours until end with family or emergency services instead of finding clubs, friends, and studying. I felt robbed of what was supposed to be one of my happiest moments in life to a life of suffering and waking up at 2 PM, missing classes, skipping all meals, etc. In fact, it got so bad after about three months that I wrote a suicide letter and was admitted into a mental hospital where I was literally stripped of all my belongings and was given a cell basically. I was almost taken against my will because all I asked was to be assessed and given immediate counseling but they decided locking me up was better because of my “suicide” letter. I wasn’t exactly suicidal but I knew I would DEFINTIELY not be able to live like this any longer and even being locked up would be better. The doctor thankfully was able to detect that being locked up was not the solution for me and promptly assigned me Prozac (fluoxetine). 

After having tried countless amounts of calling the emergency center, going out far into the city for help, calling my parents literally 7+ hours a day, etc., I was burnt out and was ready to give up and just head back home and wither there rather than an unfamiliar place. However, the notion of having a medicine seemed rather hopeful. I took it and around a week, I felt better. I was still repulsed by food and other enjoyments of life but I felt feelings. Just a week ago, I was a literal zombie. No thoughts, no emotions not even sadness or depression, just... nothing. But my sadness returned and some more human characteristics returned. By the second or third week, I was 80% recovered and actually started to eat and attend classes. By the end of the semester, I was 95% there. My OCD still persists but I no longer feel like wanting to admit myself into an emergency mental clinic anymore and actually enjoy my oh so sweet noodles, Indian food, Mexican food, whatever other food I enjoy and play my games again. 

In retrospect, this is all unbelievable and if I traveled back in time, I’m sure my zombie me would have called bullshit. But I just want to say that there is literally zero reasons to not take pills. They do not make you numb like pop culture would say, they are very cheap, and best of all, they really DO work. Just looking up fluoxetine on reddit brought out plenty of good results and we all know reddit is very cynical. I’m sure time played a small part too but the pills definitely did all the hard-lifting. We need to get rid of the anti-mental health pill stigma and we need better ways to help those who are not suicidal but still need immediate attention to get help. If I stayed in my original plan, I’d STILL not be able to meet a psychiatrist meaning NO medicine for me even now and who knows what’s would’ve happened if I didn’t get them? 

Also, I’m glad to say Ive been free of the pills for two months now and still feeling amazing as ever. If you have any questions or just need someone, feel completely free to PM me. :) Even the most impossible and hopeless situation IS curable I know it’s cliche but having gone through all this, I cannot stress it enough.

54,"Not sure if this necessarily belongs here (let me know if it doesn't and I'll post in the proper subreddit) - 

but honestly, I have a tough time taking criticism to heart. Whenever someone tells me that I'm acting bad or coming off in a jack-assy/arrogant/etc. way, or that I'm doing something wrong, or just criticizes me  in general, I have a hard time taking it to heart and working to improve myself. Instead, I just feel bad about myself and sometimes feel like crying (and I do internally). 

Like, I didn't mean to come off as jack-assy, sorry if that's how I looked to you, I didn't know. Geez, am I really that bad? Do I really have another inadequacy? These are the thoughts that go in my head. 

I just got roasted and was told I sounded arrogant and rude and that I was insulting in a discord server. Instead of taking that to heart IN A POSITIVE WAY and improving my behavior, there's literally tears in my eyes and I'm feeling down. 

I have homework to do and an early class tomorrow. I even have exams in my two toughest classes I'm taking at my university this semester later this week. but honestly, I'm hung up on this one thing and I feel like it's gonna screw up this whole week or at least the next few days. I'll keep dwelling over the fact that I am really such a bad person. Not sure if I'll even be able to give my 100% on the exams because of this.

How can I take criticism - on me as a person - positively and use it to improve as a person? And how can I move on quickly and not let it affect the next few days/weeks? How can I not let criticism stop me and make me feel shit about myself? There's literally a few tears dripping down my cheek and I'm not feeling very good about myself because of the self-criticism I just received on a discord server. 

I'd like to say that I do take criticism on my work in a positive way. It's just criticism on ME AS A PERSON that I have a hard time taking to heart positively. 

I want to improve as a person, but I have a hard time accepting that I need improvement, that I have an inadequacy, and that there's something wrong with me.  It's chewing away at my positive mental health and making me feel like shit.

58,"posting on my shiny &amp; never-before-used throwaway! since i use my main account to talk about my place of work. 

i have PTSD and severe combined-type ADHD. for almost 6 MONTHS (but probably longer, i just cant recall) ive been going thru the PTSD motions, and realizing how much my ADHD affects me at all times. ive been struggling with work, because the environment was extremely toxic and exhausting to be in. 

but ive been getting better. i dont have a lot of problems with trauma (at least not as often, and almost no nightmares! woohoo!), ive accepted my ADHD for what it is and am learning to love how fast my brain goes at all times, enjoying my interests, finding better friends, not looking for relationships (trust is one of the things i still majorly struggle with with my PTSD)... ive moved locations at my job, and i love the people i work with. 

ive even found a little bit of spirituality (before i was a mostly optimistic nihilist who didn’t believe in anything spiritual), and stopped doing drugs. my life is going well. 

but now that im doing okay... i feel bored. theres barely any conflict in my life. i want to create problems in my friendships and i keep getting waves of suicidal thoughts. i almost went thru with it, but the reasoning was “im doing this because i can &amp; to be dramatic, not because i really feel this way.”

60,"So I went to Basic Training for the U.S. Army back in October 2018. Its sort of a tradition for the men in my family and there were a lot of college benefits. 

When I got there I was totally unprepared mentally for it. Every minute I felt like I was being yelled at for something different. I never took myself for a sensitive guy, but I realized how sensitive I was here. Having to constantly do exercises anytime one person minorly messed up, having Drill Sergeants belittle us every hour, and having to constantly check to make sure that I wasn't somehow not following rules(I'm also a naturally absent minded person, so I got more exercise and was belittled even more.), made me feel like I was losing my head and I was powerless. Eventually I was given an uncharacterized discharge in December because I had failed the Physical Training Test too many times. 

Now that I'm back in the civilian world, I keep having thoughts and memories from basic training flood back to me. In those moments I feel entirely helpless and scared. It usually takes me around thirty seconds before I am able to avert my thoughts to something else, and it will take upwards to a half an hour before I'm able to get back to my normal self.

My dad and brothers experienced basic training and had full careers in the military but I am the only one who failed it. They keep telling me that basic training today is basically nothing and that I didn't experience any real mental trauma. In a way I feel they are right. I was never in any real danger. Other people have experienced worse and came out fine. But the memories just keep coming back and I always feel really scared and powerless when they do.

61,"So I'm a 22 yr old female (23 next week) I have been suffering with depression and anxiety since I was about 14 after the death of my grandad and feelings of guilt surrounding it. 
It's always been my depression that has held me back, like I cant be bothered getting up/going out etc the anxiety was just there making it difficult in social situations. 

Well now my anxiety has taken over and it's so extreme I wake up every night panicking and cant get back to sleep, tight chest, feelings of rage and the list goes on. This has all stemmed from having to go back to uni after Christmas, it's now March and I havent been to 1 lecture. My plan was to go in today but I have talked my self out of it so much and I have a horrible feeling in my stomach that something will go wrong. I havent seen people on my course in ages and I have put so much weight on, I'm just scared of the judgement I guess. 

I have been struggling with my course since I started and I'm in my final year now so this is the time that I really should be going in but I have lost all interest. I would rather just be working and earning money (I also have an appauling money situation that doesn't help). I work part time in an aquarium and I have no problems going in and doing my shifts. So it seems my anxiety is completely focused around uni.

I dont even know the purpose of my post I just needed to vent I guess. I have been seeing a therapist who has helped me so much but I only have one more session with her that I think I am going to ask to focus on anxiety with. I am also on 30mg of citalopram which I have been on for 2 years but my doctor is awful so have only seen him twice in the whole 2 years. He said to me 'you always seem so happy are you sure you have those feelings' coping mechanisms mates I have had yrs of practice.

64,"I’m in my mid 20s now and am really starting to notice the ripple effects of my childhood. I was able to push past it for a while but things have come rushing back. I think about my upbringing every day like a growing seed of anger and self pity. 

I guess there’s obvious forms of neglect and abuse. Whether it’s the dirt-poor kids not getting fed or the rich kids not getting loved or both. Then there’s the stuff that goes unnoticed. 

Mine all happened behind closed doors. It’s true how they say that the child thinks the abuse and lifestyle is normal and are trained to think other families that aren’t like yours are weird or spoilt or have the wrong values or whatever. But even though you think your family is normal, you never quite feel safe or happy in your own home. And you don’t realise this is unnatural until later on in life. By this time of course the damage is done and the trauma has set. 

Long story short; single mum; alcoholic sociopathic father. I remind mum of father which brings her pleasure to my suffering whilst favouring the other children over me extremely blatantly but never in public. 

The most frustrating part is that even they will never know how much they fucked me up. And if they knew they wouldn’t care. I wouldn’t wish this pain on my enemies. 

I’m somewhat of a perfectionist and expect a parent to be capable of loving and raising a child. I also think that once something’s damaged, it’s time for the bin. I think about ending it because there’s no coming back from this one. If I haven’t moved on and healed by now, I doubt I ever will. I have tried the whole forgiveness and compassion thing to my parents but it’s fleeting and doesn’t work. To expect an apology or recognition is asinine. The happiest was when I was angry at them and cut them off. But then we had a fake patch up and I have to play happy family and bury the resentment.

Im a 20's male and you can see my post history to find my particular version of depression. 

I feel that in order to face and hopefully improve my mental state I need to be upfront about it. If im having a chat with somebody let them know Im having a hard time. Usually try this with my closer or older friends, generally feels good to put it out there and these people I know will generally be sympathetic or understanding.   
When it comes to people my own age group, or those that aren't as close I really have no idea. 

I don't want to complain to male friends because its feels emasculating (let alone the chance they will be the 'Just be happy!' types) and like I am sabotaging my relationship with them. These people are usually 'close-ish', not the people I see 3 times a week. 

I don't want to complain to females because it reduces me in their eyes, particularly if they are somebody I might be interested in.

For instance, when I think about the news on that day, anything about a celebrity death will absolutely terrify me and sadden me to the point where I am almost shaking and panic-stricken. And whilst I typically would be saddened by tragic daytime news, when I am really sleepy in bed, these feelings intensify to the point where I'm induced to panic attack like symptoms.

78,"I have had anxiety for... I actually do not know how long but I got help after an incident that out me in a bad place after I had moved away from home

Neither my parens or my siblings know, except the do know... They are always extra early to pick me up or considerate when I want to be alone. (Except one of my sister but that is another story) My middle sister has so many times help me, drawing maps when I was afraid to get lost, helping me choose stuff after she seen me cry over it due to stress. They still freak me out and I have a hard time hanging out with them since they are demanding but they try. 

However, I have now started to take medication for my anxiety and am starting to doubt my decision to keep my family out from my mental health. I always promote that we should talk more about mental health and here I am, not even my family knows me myself struggles with mental health. I have a sister that is a big pain in the ass and maybe she stop being a pain in the ass if I tell her or she will start to think I'm weak it an attention seeker and just bullies me more. Maybe my family will be more forgiving when I get an ""overload"" and frankly gets a bit nasty or they will think I'm just a spoiled brat making a big deal out of nothing. 

I'm not embarrassed to have anxiety or that I take medication but I do not want them to look at me differently. My mom has a brother suffering from... Something but we never talk about it. So I do not know what it is She has rushed him to the hospital several times. I have a cousin that suffers from anorexia and another that is self harming but same there, we do not talk about it but I know that my mom has supported my cousins  mom. My nasty sister has a friend that is on a psyke woard and my other syster told me that she was hanging a identity crisis. My mom knows about the big ""suicide prevention campaign"" that is in my country and has said that it is a really good thing that people help. But we never talk about OUR mental health. We never talk about anything serious in our own lives when I came to think about it. When I told my mom about me having a big operation she actually told me to just keep it between herself and me, not to tell anyone else. 

I do not know guys, what do you think? Should I tell them?

79,"for starters, I have high functioning autism. I was diagnosed at 12, so I'm not sure if this would affect this overall question. when I made a joke about me having ADHD to my parents once, they aid they already had me looked at, and the doctors said no. but looking at the symptoms I see a lot of correlation with my own behaviors.

 

**Behavioral:** aggression(I've always had anger issues), excitability(yes.), fidgeting(I stim and bite my nails and pens a lot), hyperactivity(yes.), impulsivity(A lot of the time I'll just look at something, say fuck it, and do it, and its typically very risky), irritability(I've been described by my parents as easily irritable) , lack of restraint(I have some issues with portion control, and do a lot of typically unhealthy things or lash out very easily), or persistent repetition of words or actions (again, stimming)

**Cognitive:** absent-mindedness (I'll constantly get stuck in my own train of thought in my classes and outside of class and zone out for a long time) , difficulty focusing(when I need to get something done, even when I try to focus I'll usually get distracted), forgetfulness (I'll forget the words that I just read or the instructions I was just told incredibly often), problem paying attention (see absent-mindedness and difficulty focusing), or short attention span (to a degree yes. when its one of my special interests though, I enter the zone, although its often thinking about these interests that gets me into a state of absent mindedness)

**Mood:** anger(Again, anger issues), anxiety(for the past year or so i've been paranoid and anxious at an increasing rate and have been experiencing sensory overload whenever I enter deep into an anxious or paranoia attack), boredom(I get easily bored), excitement(yes.), or mood swings(from my own biased observation I do tend to switch from one feeling to another almost instantly)

**Also common:** depression or learning disability

80,"Hi. So I've been getting these really intense flashbacks from moments in my childhood. Mainly bad ones that involved physical pain. It gets to the point where i can mentally feel the same panic i felt then. I was beaten by my parents, mainly my mom when i was a child. 

When i got old enough to defend myself, she kept  playing the ""ow you hurt me, you're a bad child for hurting your mom"". I feel like these moments have really affected my mental health. I'm not sure whether i should seek counselling for it or not. I now study abroad in the UK and have access to counselling if i talk to my gp. I really have no idea where to start though because i feel like i have a host of issues. ",26Feb2019,1
81,"I currently am not in a very stable mental state to say the least, but before that here is some background info. I am 17 years of age, live in a high-middle class family, have various pets, go to and have always been to a dying private school with only about 300 people (I'm talking from Pre-Kinder level to Senior level), infact, in my class we are only 13. I live in the United States. A few months ago I became, with the lack of a better term, depresive (Yes I know depresion and sadness are completely diferent but that the only word I could think of). I started seeing the World through different lenses, I started to write a Journal (I would mostly write things I had a problem with). I consider myself a very peaceful, respectful and happy person. I really like to make other people laugh and smile, even when my own smile is not a real one. I even hangout with people  I dislike and are unpopular for the sake of being nice.But when I changed I was very pesamistic, and started isolating myself from the rest of my classmates, and as I stated before, started writing. After that, I realized something. I am Alone, am Ugly and I am Stressed. 

When I say I am alone, I don't mean I don't have friends, I mean that there are certain things I can't say to someone that hurt if they stay inside of me (thats why I used to write, to ""tell"" the pages those things). And that I need Affection. Love from the opposite sex. Now, this is more of a subjective topic but, I have this feeling that I am not attractive. Although I can safely say that I am a pretty decent looking fellow, I, for some reason, keep telling myself that I am Ugly and therefore will never find the Affection you so desperately seek. Last but not least, I am stressed that people that I dislike now think I'm their best friend because I hang out with them and on top of that, I don't have the balls to tell them to fuck off. I really don't know what else to say, Ive been given the world and I still feel like a piece of shit, making me feel even more like a piece of shit knowing that I've been given the world and there's not way one cannot be happy with all that I've received. I just need someone to talk to, and I believe that talking to a stranger about these things might be more helpful than talking to someone you know. I don't use Reddit that much but i just need advice. I feel like I am in front of an irrational wall built by me and I don't know how to topple it over.",26Feb2019,1
82,"Recently a car bang me or I banged a car but from the look of it, it seems like the car banged me and it was pretty bad. I couldn’t say anything cause the dude have all his homies and I’m (female) alone with my 6 y/o sis. The driver was cussing me and said some bad words. So I called my mom and her first question was whether my baby sis was okay and how badly was the damaged to the car. She went to the scene called my dad and whatnot and it took us about 2 hours to settled it. It was clear that my parents will settle the damage- the cost was little over 500. 

We went to the foreman and the driver dropped of his homies and called out another more aggressive looking homies to come to the foreman. This time they demanded to change scratch that was even near the damage. My parents who wouldn’t want to risk getting beating now has to pay over 3 grand for their car. And it’s about 4 grand to fix ours too because of the damage. 

But what saddens me was it wasn’t my fault entirely and no one wants to listen to me. The driver was going fast as I was about to cross. My car wasn’t moving and I remember vividly as I was about to step on the gas, the car came fast and oh well. 

My parents aren’t talking to me. They wouldn’t want to give me a ride to my training place too. I have to spend 50 bucks a day just to go back and forth from home to my training place. 

Till this day, my parents didn’t even ask me how was I from the accident. I was shaking really bad but I couldn’t just panic and risk being vulnerable because I was alone and with some men. I was shaken up and I have nightmare about the incident too. But no one seems to care about it. They only asked about the car and my baby sis. No one asked about me and I’m sad. It’s all my fault but no one wants to listen. It’s all my fault I’m a waste of space. I don’t have the money to pay my parents back too. If I didn’t went out that day, if only I stayed home that day this wouldn’t happen. I’m so so useless of a child to my parents

87,"I know a woman in desperate need of help identifying the mental health disorder and/or learning disability she has. 

She has been to a number of mental health professionals, but all have been stupidly dismissive and absurdly unhelpful. 

Symptoms:
- gets overwhelmed extremely easily, to the point where she’s incapable of doing complex tasks like filing taxes, cleaning a room, or driving a car. (she says things like “I don’t know where to start and my brain just shuts down.”)
- Gets bored and distracted extremely easily and can’t focus on one thing too long, with the exception of video games. She doesn’t like to drive because she’s been in several accidents due to this problem. 
- Has chronic, low grade, full body muscle and joint pain and weakness, and sometimes has difficulty holding objects like coffee mugs.
- Depression, but that seems like a result of the other three problems.
- Minor anxiety, again mostly due to these other problems. 

It sucks because she’s highly intelligent and really hard working, but can’t get a degree or hold down a job, and everything is a struggle. Currently, she gets up at five a.m. every day and takes a bus to a job caring for abused dogs, where she shovels shit and gets bitten all day. She’s miserable, but it’s the only job she can do. 

“Diagnosis” she has been given from various mental health professionals:

- too much caffeine (even though she rarely drinks coffee)
- minor depression
- Immaturity 
- minor ADHD
- Low self control
- Laziness
- Fibromyalgia 
- Laziness and immaturity 

Whatever she has, it seems to run in the women in her family. It’s very clearly not immaturity or laziness, nor is it just ADHD or depression. 

Any thoughts on what this could be would be a great starting point.  ",26Feb2019,2
88,"I like to work efficiently, walk and travel efficiently and basically do things without lolygagging around. As I'm going through the day, it feels like others are constantly waiting behind me expecting me to hurry up. Some examples: I live with roommates and without fail, whenever I go into the bathroom, as soon as I'm closing the door, one of the other roommates comes out to use the bathroom so I have to sower or do whatever quickly to free up the room. If I'm driving and switch lanes because the person in front is going slow, I'll get over and even though I'm going over the speed limit, there is someone riding right up on my ass. If I go to work and am at the vending machines, there is always someone else waiting for it so I don't have time to look at the options and make a choice without just picking something fast and getting out.

On some days he is in a good mood and is sociable but on some days, hes cold and wont reply much. This november, the latter has been more frequent. Id get scanty replies be it through text or face to face, and I dont think anyone would like that. Id ask if hes ok and hed say the generic response ""Im fine""

He has never shown any signs that he does not like me. as a matter of fact, its the opposite (as a friend).

*  If we havent seen each other in a week and then we do, hed say something like ""its good to see you i havent seen you in a while.'

*  On some occasion he seems happy to see me and looks upset when i leave. He also shows moderate forms of affection (see below)

* We went from fist bumps to handshakes to those brohug handshakes (which he was the first to start doing). Mid november on one occasion, he pat me on the waist when he said goodbye to me. That might seem like a small matter...but its a bit 'romantic' for a dude to do that to another - although im not bothered by it. And definitely you wont do that to someone you dont like

From mid november onwards he has been a bit cold and his bad days were more frequent. hed  reply me with one word up front and gets annoyed when i try talking to him. at one point he even snapped when i asked a question. He had gone sour with me all of a sudden.

I confronted him through text that eventhough i apologized for the question, i shouldve recieved one for being snapped at. and since he has no interest in talking to me lately, i wont be talking to him. i got no response.

A week+ later I realize everyone makes mistakes and have bad days, and I shouldnt retaliate at the first mistake especially since he has been nice to me in the past. i send an apology for retaliating (eventhough i deserve one) because i dont want to make things worse for him. still no response.

Eventually I meet him at the gym and we do that brohug thing...as if weve moved forward. I ask to talk to him after hes done working out and he said ok. He didnt. He went straight home and sent me a text saying he doesnt want to talk and goes to the gym just to workout and only that (not to talk).

Seeing how we might not talk anymore, i told him how i felt. How Ive always felt like hes going through something because i noticed the mood swings. told him he can still talk to me if he needs someone to talk to, and if he doesnt want to talk to me, talk to someone, because bottling things are bad.

No response also. We havent blocked each other. and at no point have we attacked each other personally. Im a bit worried about his wellbeing and quite upset that I may have lost a friend. My fear is that stress and anxiety (atleast) are getting to him.

Eventually we bumped into each other at christmas day and we wished each other a merry christmas. However, the rest of the day he avoided eye contact and the bad vibes were still there.

Three weeks afterwards we bump i to each other and this time he initiates. He waves at me from a far, and sooner he actually came up to me and started having a convo. It was a good convo, good vibes.

A few weeks later (havent seen him since ☝🏼) I follow him on his unprivate instagram but no follow back.

Im utterly confused at his behaviour. Does he want to be friends or not? Furthermore I am leaving the state soon (for a very long time) and I have not seen him since.

90,"First time poster here (mid twenties guy). I've been struggling with depression, drugs and alcohol for several years now. Never so intense I can't get out of bed or that it's destroying my life, but more like a gray cloud over me all the time. I'm a very happy, positive person which almost makes it worse because everyone just assumes I'm totally fine. Moving on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not one to go straight to the doctor (not that it can't be a very good thing). But I've just been doing some soul searching recently trying to really look at myself deeply and see what I can see. And what I've seen over that last several months is interesting. Quick footnote, I grew up in a loving household with great parents. But my oldest sister was a bit off the rails, drugs and depression at a young age. Suicidal and violent. Ran away all the time and ended up having to go into full time care for a while. So from like 9-15 years old, that was my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I digress. I find myself (maybe subconsciously) drifting to the things I found comfort in as a kid during those hard times. Random stuff like painting model cars, listening to old albums, and I really only enjoy the video games I used to love to play (Roller Coaster Tycoon...still a badass game either way). Same with the foods I eat and movies I watch.

There is no one in my class who shows any symptoms of social anxiety or one of the other common anxiety disorders and not only this class. In my old class there was no one too. (I failed my last class that is why I have a new one.)  There do was a girl who is now one of my close friends, who had an eating disorder but no one has an anxiety disorder. (I'm in 9th grade (German school) btw)

Is there any reason for it or does it take years to develop some sort of social anxiety.

**This is what was lacking in my life, I'll go get an alligator and feel better now** ( if he bites my head off i won't feel pain anymore after all )

95,"Explanation first, then questions: my SO has been hospitalized for a manic episode. His only mental health history is diagnosed depression and anxiety. He has severe chronic pain that makes it hard to function, including making it hard to sleep. We have been seeing so many doctors and are making some progress on the pain, but it was still a lot to bear.

It's possible that this manic episode is due to a bad batch of pot that he got right before it happened. He said it's something he hadn't tried before. Usually pot is what lets him get to sleep. This time he hardly slept at all, even with his most sedating medications.

He's on his third day in a good hospital now but there's no change in his condition. You can get intelligible answers to short questions, but otherwise he rambles angrily, pausing only to ask angrily whether you understand, and answering with anything other or more than ""yes"" makes him angrier. He's not actually violent, but you can feel the rage and frustration radiating off him.

Nobody at the hospital will venture even the slightest guess or educated guess to me about what will happen. I understand why this is. But I need to know: is it really equally possible that he'll be home next week, or that he'll be in an institution for the rest of his life, or every other possibility in between? Does anyone have experience that can give you an educated guess on most likely/less likely outcomes? I don't want promises or guarantees. On a practical level I need to know whether this really might go on for weeks or months so I can plan for that life. And on an emotional level I need to know whether I might ever get my dearest love back. I know it's premature to be that worried, but I can't help catastrophizing when they won't say anything to that question.

Half a year ago, I’m not sure what went wrong and I did the most horrible mistake in my life by cheating on her - having ONS with another girl met online. I felt tremendous guilt after the deed and I called her many times right after the event around midnight. She didn’t pick up my phone calls. Fast forward to the next day, I confessed to her the moment we met after work. She was in disbelief but at the same time she wanted to console me because she can’t see me crying and being sad. 

Fast forward to this month, she has been complaining waking up feeling lost and afraid few hours she went to sleep every single night. She woke up feeling afraid and scrambled for her phone. She feels a lot of guilt for not picking up my call on the day of the incident. 

On top of that, she started hearing voices inside her head every single day. The voices have different personalities according to her. They all have their opinions and fight each other. She used to try to fight those voices but lately she’s been really tired mentally and couldn’t bothered anymore. The only thing keeping her from giving up is because she still wants to be together with me. 

She is afraid of the dark. She’s easily startled especially when someone walks past her. Sometimes she even think that she sees someone standing in a distance but the next second the person is not there. 

Her symptoms are usually worse at night and when she’s alone.

100,"I've read in a study that the average age of onset for Social Anxiety is 13. For me, my Social Anxiety really kicked in when I was 14. I'm 21 now. I do feel like with time, age, and maturity my Social Anxiety has settled down. I'm not cured, but I feel better than I was when I was a teenager.

I know during puberty/adolescence you deal with a lot of hormonal changes. You're changing physically and mentally.

They say teenagers often get moody, rebellious, and experience mental health like anxiety and depression because of hormonal changes.

I've read that mental problems bloom during puberty.

However, do these problems like anxiety and depression that show up during puberty subside with age?

I've read that hormone levels from puberty begin to subside during the late teens and early 20's (The end of adolescence).

Could my experience be a reflection of that?

102,"I've been in a bad mental state lately, and it all boils down to my appearance, my self worth and my social ability.

Before I begin, I appreciate if you would not reply with generic answers like ""value yourself, you're worth so much more,"" because these are all just words. It's easier said than done.

It all began when I started talking to this guy at work because we had to plan an event together. He asked me to follow him to a gay bar, as friends of course - I never thought of it as a date or anything, and I agreed.

Some info about me, I've have very low self esteem, and for the right reason - I'm not attractive (average face &amp; body). I'm not extroverted, and I've been rejected hundreds of times to the point where I think it's second nature to me.

So as me and this guy made our way to the gay bar, he talked to me about his date, love and sex life, all which I couldn't relate, and made me a lot more self conscious.

At the bar, I didn't feel better. I've never been to a gay bar before and I don't think I would ever again. I felt so out of place amongst all the big, good looking guys. I was the only awkward lonely guy.

Fast forward through the night, after a few glasses of drinks, both of us were talking to a guy each. I was talking to someone of a mutual friend. 

I've never been good in social situations ever since I was a kid, but made huge improvements over the last few years. That being said, I still suck. So my conversation with the guy I was talking too slowly died down. And I glanced over at my friend who was with the other guy looking at us and laughing. I heard them laughing about me being awkward, me being a ""noob"" in a gay bar, and about me having low alcohol tolerance.

I pretended to be okay after hearing all those things, until the night ended. When I got home I actually cried and confronted my friend politely. He apologized and said he had no intention of making me feel small and worthless, and I appreciate it.

However I just have not been okay ever since. The events that happened just made me hate myself a lot. I've lost interest in almost everything, I even cried at work thinking about how worthless I am, and how I have no one - even my only best friend is drifting.

I honestly have no idea what I'm trying to get out of this - maybe I need a listening ear, maybe I need some advice. But whatever it is, I have decided to change the things about myself that are within my controls, like my fitness. Hopefully this would make me feel a lot better.",26Feb2019,1

105,"This is gonna be a long babble of random shit so grab some popcorn and relax :)

I’ve always thought that there was something different with what I was thinking or doing but I never knew if I was just dramatising small things or if I genuinely wasn’t “normal” as society perceives people. As I’ve recently started looking back on things I’ve done in my younger years and even very recently (for reference, I’m 15 in a few months time) I’ve started to realise strange occurrences in my physical and mental behaviour. The next load of information will be me outlining off the top of my head anything I do or think that I’ve noticed is a common symptom of common mental conditions such as ADHD and OCD. 
Before I start I would like to say thank you to anyone who bothers to read this and help out, it will be much appreciated.

I’m going to begin with talking about what I believe to be common associations with OCD and anxiety: I have noticed many things that I do normally in everyday life that are strangely ordered and precise and I know that definitely aren’t usual. When I was younger I would always do things a certain number of times, whether that would be tapping my foot always an odd number of times, clapping my hands a number of times that was a multiple of 2, the list really goes on. This has now continued to me being obsessed with doing things perfectly right, such as trying to blink “perfectly” (I really don’t know how to explain it at this point) and to never put things down on a table touching any edges or cracks or other items. My handwriting at school is always scribbled out and stuff because if I feel a letter isn’t written right (for example if I right an “o” and the loop is too small or 2 lines are close to touching in a letter but I can’t tell if they’re touching or not) then I will just rewrite the whole word. Also in school my everyday habits are strangely meticulous. When I sit on a chair I can’t have the chair legs touching any other chair or any part of the table, if they are then this immediately makes me anxious and uncomfortable. This affects everything I do in the everyday and I can’t stop it because if I do something wrong then my mind instantly draws my attention to it and forces me to correct it. I’ve had an example of situations like these very recently, when in a chemistry lesson we had to use polystyrene cups and there were a couple of specks of dirt in my cup and I wouldn’t start the experiment until I had made sure that the cup was completely clean. It didn’t affect me in anyway, my mind was just waging a war against my physical being and forcing me to clean out the cup. 
I’ve watched a lot of “oddly satisfying” videos on YouTube, and none of them make my brain feel at ease or satisfied unless I know for a fact that they are completely perfect. For example, someone cutting a cake that has some nice patterns makes me feel anxious and on edge, because I know that it hasn’t been perfectly sliced or the patterns aren’t perfectly equal. However, my mind feels perfectly calm and satisfied through images and videos created digitally or by artificial intelligence, such as mechanical machines cutting large squares of product for example, because I know that everything is equal and has been done perfectly. 
I’ve also noticed that I’ve displayed another anxiety symptom recently, and it’s around the topic of disassociation (I think?). I’ve noticed this recently and it only happens when I’m walking around school or in a large group of people. I suddenly subconsciously zone out and forget that I’m in the vicinity of other people. It sort of makes me feel that I’m alone and in a dreamlike state. Then suddenly I jolt back to my senses and sort of come back into my own head. It’s an incredibly strange sensation and I don’t know why it’s happening.
The final thing is to do with me being incredibly self conscious and anxious when in public. This mainly is centred around my hair, I cannot go out in public if I have 1 thing wrong with my hair, whether it be that some of it is slightly sticking up, or it feels slightly too greasy. This has led to me showering way too often and spending too much time in the morning trying to make sure that everything is right with my hair. I constantly seek approval from friends at school, whether I’m asking if some work I did looks fine or if I look ok, and on non uniform days it is the absolute worst. I will ask multiple people if it’s non uniform, I will check to see if there are any notices on my schools website to confirm it, I will absolutely 100% make sure that I am doing the right thing, and when it comes to wearing non uniform I will always wear something to blend in and always make sure nothing is out of place or make sure that I’m not wearing anything that will make people judge me. 


Welp I’ve probably missed some stuff out there but it’s time to move on because I’m bored of talking about that stuff :D

Moving on, I’ve had a few issues with my mental well-being in the past as well, or so I’ve thought. In the spring of 2017, I was daydreaming in a maths lesson when everything changed for me. My mind got sidetracked and for some reason I started thinking about things so existential that got caught in a spiral of confusion. I started mentally questioning what happened after death, and started thinking about how it would never end. Never end. This made me more scared than I’d ever been and I started having a massive panic attack. I was so scared about death and I never wanted it to happen but I did at the same time and it was the only thing that I could think about. I remember tears falling down my face and my friends were asking me why I was crying and I had to make a shite excuse and a joke about it. Over the next 2 months or so I was mentally a wreck. Everything would make me sad and random things would bring me to the verge of tears. Whenever I wasn’t doing anything I would think along the same path and start the horrible thoughts of death again. I googled depression and bipolar, and I had all the symptoms. I started searching about different religions, and what they thought about death and I looked everywhere for help on how to be happy and how to enjoy life. I never got any treatment, the only thing that got me through it was me telling myself that it happens to everyone and I’ll eventually get through it. Nowadays I can control myself, occasionally my mind will start to wander and I feel waves of panic coming on but I’ve learnt to instantly shut it down. I don’t know what happened to me. Maybe it was just a young teenage phase, maybe I was just having a bad time for a while, I don’t know. 

I’m just going to conclude with a ramble about how I have recently had great difficulty when it’s come to concentrating on things. I’ve noticed that whenever there’s long solid text to read for example in lessons, then I’ve just straight away zoned out and have not been able to concentrate long enough to read and understand it all. Even if I managed to read a whole page of writing, I won’t absorb it all and it will take a long time to understand what it actually said. This reached its peak during a recent biology test. I have never really before had any trouble with concentration, but this is what made me really start thinking that something was wrong. For the first half of the test, I stared into space without thinking about what I was doing. I’m normally very concerned with doing well on tests and this was the same as usual, but I just completely lost focus and didn’t do anything. I eventually came to my senses with roughly 20 minutes left and hurriedly finished the remainder of my paper (I had about 90% to still finish). Furthermore I have no idea what category this fits into, but I constantly have music playing in my head. It can be any random song, but no matter how hard I try, no matter what solutions I find, it will never stop. When I was younger I had a clock in my room on the wall (it was a proper clock, not a digital one), but i had to have it taken out because I couldn’t get to sleep, because my mind would hear the ticking of it and immediacy think of rhythms and songs to go with the beat. I also always grind my teeth, whether it be to random rhythms or to the songs that always play in my head. Also I forgot to mention that I always tap my feet wherever I am, it isn’t to any rhythm or anything, just whenever I’m sitting down I just always do it. I’ve also done it so frequently that recently one of my school teachers alerted me to the fact that I was doing and my table was shaking.

I guess that’s about it. There’s definitely stuff that I’ve missed out but I will try and elaborate on anything if you have any questions to ask. If you’ve read this far, then I will be eternally grateful, and any advice or things to say will be gladly accepted :) ",26Feb2019,1
106,"I don't know which one it was.  Here are my theories:

- I did twice the speed limit on a city road and held the accelerator down then did a 45 degree left a 90 degree right and then a 135 degree left which ended up acting as a brake and stalled my engine.  Then I pretended to hide a weapon, threw my dinner out the window like it was contraband, and ran away to wait for the cops to get me.  I did all this because I had a dream about doing this once when I was 16 and it popped back into my head as soon as I turned onto the road and saw my opportunity to finally capitalize.  The thing is it was some crazy stuntman maneuvers where I didn't bump into anything or come near flipping (even though an SUV being 45 degree to the left while still traveling in the correct traffic flow direction at over 100km/h should have been disaster).

- I did twice the speed limit on a city road and held the accelerator down then did a 45 degree left a 90 degree right and then a 135 degree left which ended up acting as a brake and stalled my engine.  Then I panicked and pretended to hide a weapon to make it look like I did this intentionally, and threw my dinner out for homeless people (it was cold outside and late night so the food would preserve well), then ran away out of embarrassment.

107,"I’ve always been kind of the rock and the person in my small family (dad and brother) who listens to their issues and struggles. I carry the weight of their financial, personal, and mental struggles. Even if I can’t help, I allow them to vent to me. 

Both need mental help. My dad is an old, lonely, alcoholic who says we are his only reason to live and don’t visit enough. We don’t. He’s so hard to spend time with, but i still call weekly and listen to his problems. My old brother is a ball of nerves and has to take tons of sick days because he can’t get out of bed. I listen and try to empathize with him too. 

Now to me - I turned to therapy 2.5 years ago and work very hard to gain control of issues in my life (infertility, anxiety). In the last few months, therapy alone isn’t helping my anxiety and some old OCD issues are coming back so I’m trying to find a psychiatrist (surprisingly hard when you aren’t in complete melt down mode).  I’m struggling to make it through the days without crying or literally pulling hair out.  I should also mention all this got much worse after a hysterectomy. 

So now I’ve pulled back from my family, but I feel like I’m abandoning them. The last time I called my dad, he was so drunk. I shut down. I talked to him pretty much emotionless. He has health issues, so typically i would continue to call daily to make sure he was well. I haven’t this time. I can’t. I can’t bring myself to make the call. 

My brother and I usually take once a week, but it’s been over two weeks. The last time we spoke, it was very agitated and anxious. Again, I can’t seem to force myself To reach out. 

I’m barely keeping it together myself. Daily I’m doing everything I can - exercising as much as I can post surgery, meditation, eating healthy (healthy-ish; I have caved in sugar a few times), continuing therapy, and searching for a psychiatrist that could help me get over what I hope is a temporary state. 

So this is a bit of a rant, but also a question. What do I owe the adults in my life when I’m struggling mentally? I’m very honest with my husband about my good days and bad days. The guilt I’m feeling about not being there for my dad and brother is growing, but I’m also not equipped to take on their burden. I’m really lost. Any advice or even just words of suppor would be appreciated!

TL;DR - what do you do when you are the strong one in a family of people with mental illness/addiction issues who aren’t getting help and you are having mental struggles of your own that you are trying to take care of? thanks ",26Feb2019,4

It hurt so incredibly bad that I barely made it through game one and I played very poorly. The whole game I felt like I was going to fall over and die.

119,"Hello. For the past year, I've been always wondering if my bouts of suicidal idealisation, self-harm and loathing are made up for attention. I've had bouts like this since I was 11, but it was only recently when I started questioning myself this much. The reasons I keep thinking I'm fake are:

*  The fact that they don't happen regularly, and on the contrary, I have days where I will feel great before I crash down (Wouldn't call it mania, though. I looked it up, mine are not as intense)
* \-Having a tendency to weaponize my negative emotions i.e. threaten suicide on my friends when I'm in a sudden low and I can't control myself. I know I'm terrible for doing that, but given I've actually attempted suicide before (following the threats usually), my friends take it pretty seriously.
* Being afraid to disclose them in a genuine and polite way fearing that I'll exaggerate them when in reality, it may not actually be a big deal (My mom tells me that all the time)
* Thinking I'm faking panic attacks or other breakdowns just because I'm spiteful and want to make up a scene for granted, even when I'm in the midst of doing them. (My mom would shout at me to stop being theatrical and hit me when I'd have panic attacks sometimes)
* My self harm being fairly superficial (I mainly bite myself, but I did that as a little kid due to my autism, and my cuts are pretty shallow and healed quickly), which makes me think I do it just to show off, even though I'd do them to try to validate my emotions to myself.
* Doing well in school. I'm currently doing 6th form (Equivalent to AP for Americans) in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computing at a fairly prestigious school, currently doing well. I am planning on getting a Maths degree and maybe get into teaching.
* Telling the doctor last time that I feel like I need medication, which makes me think I'm just ignorant and want an easy way out, also thinking that maybe I never had a problem to begin with and am just making it up for drugs to show off.

My friends think I have Borderline and the doctors think I just need to listen to my parents more and that it's just my Autism (which actually angers me when they say that but then what if it's true, and recently I actually finally got admitted to therapy to their answer is to be cleared) but I fear that if I use them to justify my actions and clear my way to get better, I just won't and will just make whatever illness I'm labelled with as my personality and identity.

I'd also read these ""signs you're making your mental illness up for attention"" articles with the intention of beating myself up for fitting with most of those signs, which only draws me into the pit of loath and mutilation.

The reason why I've been writing this is that I want to know if there's actually something that's causing this in me, it's something normal that passes or I'm just toxic. Please tell me your thoughts. If that's ok, I will delete this post after a while.

When I was a small child, about 7 years old I killed a litter of baby kittens with a rock because I was afraid my friend would take them. Sort of like a “If I can’t have them, no one can!” moment. I used to be very angry all the time and would spend time torturing insects and little stuff until I was about 10. Then I started chilling out.

There’s the sad, nihilistic personality in me as well. It tells me that nothing matters, that we are all little meaningless blips and that if I do something bad to someone it doesn’t matter, since in the grand scale of things it doesn’t mean a thing.

I can still recall when it first came onto me, which is weird becasue i can pinpoint an actual moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I can remember standing up and feeling dizzy, it felt like i had stood up too fast and got lightheaded. The lighheaded effect went away but the confusion lngered, i thought nothing of it for the next couple hours, i carried on with my work, went home, and went to bed. I awoke with the same feeling something was ""just not right"" i went to work that day on the friday and when work finished it was still there, this feeling of not being right, not in my own mind. Still, i carried on and thought it will go away, maybe im stressed, ( was going away on holiday for a week with friends come the monday). Finally the holiday came and i still felt the same, i was able to enjoy myself to a degree but i was now becoming more anxious, more stressed due to the fact that i still feel weird. Id be much happier if it was an illness, at least id know what was wrong, but with this i was worried for the unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, i got home and spent the night with my girlfriend, i told her what was wrong and how i felt, this helped and i tried to catch some sleep. Withing 30 mins i knew somethign wasnt right, my heart was racing, i couldnt get comfy and i was sweating, and to top it all off my nose started bleeding out of nowhere. i imedietly shot up in a panic demanding an ambulance becasue i thought i was having a heart attack. I started panicking, crying, it turned into a full blown panic attack, i couldnt breathe i couldnt speak and was shaking. This was a first for me. I managed to calm down later on and get some sleep, i felt better, i felt that a whole weight lifted off me. I went to work the next day, it got to about 2pm where suddenly it hit me, this confused state of not knowing what i was doing, what was going on, a complete dream state, and the again, another panic attack.

&amp;#x200B;

The feeling set me down a road of the worst depression, close to ending it all. I didnt actually feel bad and i didnt feel bad before that day, thats the scariest part, i just was not myself, i wasnt aware of what was going on, almost like i was living somone elses life and i was just looking through VR goggles. I opted to try therapy first as ive wanted to stay clear of pills for as long as possible.

Therapy helped, a lot. Talking things through, how it feels and more than anything, knowing im not alone. Since my first panic attack, ive had a few more, some bad, some not as bad, but i can deal with them, I know whats coming. The issue i have now is, i dont feel depressed, im not stressed about anything, ive changed job and landed a really good one, but still, something just isnt right. It sometimes goes away and i forget about it and other times it comes on strong and i need to fight through, but its still there, holidng me back. Its also now left me with terrible anxiety, constantly over thinking things, worriyng about my heart and unable to drink alcohol. (i wasnt much of a drinker anyway but now i cant even enjoy a beer)

To sum up, the worst thing is, i dont feel comfortable in my own head, it feels like im not in control anymore.

The main point of this essay is to get feedback, and to get a chance to speak to anyone who has felt like this, if they have any tips or really just their story. I find hearing other peoples experience comforts me and shows that its not just me with this condition, that rarely ever gets covered as it is so personal.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive missed a lot, but if there are any questions ill be able to answer, but mainly id like to know if anyone else has had any experience with this.",26Feb2019,1

126,"I am 26 years old, I am achieved nothing in my life, I cannot seem to be able to care for people, my ex girlfriend I think I loved her but I treated her so bad, I was so manipulative and I demanded sex all the time and pressured her, I smoke, drink and gamble my money away, I dislike men who I deem as more attractive or taller, I feel ugly and stupid. 

I hate myself, I hate that I am not successful I hate that I am lazy I hate that after I feel like I can work on myself I do exactly the same evil shit. I look at hardcore porn and often chain masturbate, I have taken drugs, I take care of my Grandmother right now and hiding my drinking and late nights at the casino is hard.

I really want to be better, to be normal and kind and reasonable but I cannot seem to do it, I feel like I need to be better than people to be happy, I want the prettiest girls and to be the most witty and charming person. 

I am told I am charming but my charm is a lie, it is a weapon I use to manipulate people and to dominate people, I can be brutally honest and unnecesarily offensive, I can be warm and charming to people I feel like i need to be, while spitting on the rest.

I wish I could laugh at normal jokes, and share interests and hobbies, all i am is a drunken bore who spends evening after evening watching people play video games instead of being productive, I tortured and killed insects in my youth and bullied my now male to female transgender sister constantly which has affected her confidence I am sure.

I am a sexual deviant and a demanding lover, I pity myself and pity others for being lesser than me, ( in my eyes)  i spend all my money, I cannot organise myself, I never finish anything I start, I hate my body, I hate that I have a small penis 4.5"" I hate that I am only 5'9 and I resent people who I deem to be more attractive.

I try and care, I try and love but I cannot, I am selfish and incapable of sharing my emotions with others properly, often people's behaviour confuses me and I am even unkind to people on the internet.

I sorely want to change but I feel the best thing for me is to be alone, to bring children into the world would be unfair I am not a good person, to date anymore women would be unfair, I will only hurt them.

I have never been diagnosed but I think I am a sociopath, I think that I cannot change that reality, I wish I could love and laugh and be normal and care and be gentle without faking it. I wish I was a Man not a boy I hope that one day I will make it but it seems doubtful 

Sorry for the long text, sorry for the repition. I think I need help?

129,"Sorry not sure if this is the right place for this but just need to share my thoughts 

I am currently at university (the year before my final one). I used to be a very productive student (got high marks in my exams etc) and I really enjoy learning about my subject. I also did a fair amount of voluntary work. However nearly a year ago I became very stressed and started to self harm. I found it helped and just ignored that part that told me it was bad. I think the punishment drove me forward. 

Before Christmas it became very bad and I had to go the doctors. However I still managed to do my exams and get good marks in them. I only told on of my friends (not particularly close.) I hate the idea of my closer friends/family knowing as I am aware how much it will hurt them. After Christmas I went to the universities counselling sessions for a bit and that helped at lot. I haven't hurt myself in a few weeks. 

However my motivation/productivity has collapsed. I don't care about doing uni work (but I want to care!!) I still do a a bit of voluntary work. Most of my time is spent going on walks, listening to music and doing some flat cleaning/cooking. I hoped that failing at things in uni would motivate me but it isn't working. My parents know I am not doing much and are very supportive but I just feel really guilty about wasting time and money (they pay for my accommodation.)   

Do I face a choice between my productivity and my well-being? Am I just to weak to cope with normal life without self harm / alcohol / other additive thing? 

If you are hurting like I am please talk to someone, don't let your thoughts just spiral inside your head.   ",26Feb2019,3

131,"I know this may seem insignificant to some of you guys, but I’ve struggled with depression for a long time and I find myself feeling suicidal over minor inconveniences that others would brush off.

Today I had a meeting with my research advisor and we have a pretty close relationship where we joke and get personal about a lot of things so I didn’t seem to think anything of what I was doing at the time. He stuttered a few times on a specific word and I repeated the word he was fumbling over each time but I laughed after I’d repeat it just because he would tease me in the past (out of love though) only this time he got serious and told me that he didn’t like when people tease him but he let it slide because I was one of his special students. 

I honestly didn’t mean to upset him. That would never be my intention especially since my friends and I always poke fun at eachother over little things like that.

But today I'm deciding to stop taking both of them -- the lorazepam out of wanting to withdraw, and the quetiapine out of fear of its long-term effects + it's not working out for my sleep anymore.

136,"Okay, so im 18 (f) and i went through a pretty severe mental breakdown over the past few months. I have struggled with depression for quite a while and it just all came to a head and exploded out of me. I finally feel as though im back to a manageable state of mind.  HOWEVER - i despise how i look, and its all i can think about. Before this break down, i was generally good looking. I had long, blonde hair, clear skin, an amazing figure (apologies if i sound self absorbed) i was happy with how i looked. However, my breakdown resulted in 50% of my hair falling out, me chopping it to chin length, adding a fringe, and dying it black! I also gained a little bit of weight, im not noticeably overweight or anything, but im not happy with how my body carries the weight (all in my stomach, with stick legs and arms) i also have completely messed up my skin somehow, as my face is covered in scars from spots. I just look like an actual gremlin, and i feel as though i used to look really pretty before. 
I understand that looks aren't everything , but its really hard for me to feel happy when im walking around like this. I don't have any money to change anything like getting extensions or a gym membership, as I've been off work because of my breakdown. 
I just don't know how to feel attractive again. I don't have any friends who can help me boost my confidence, i only have my boyfriend, but he has commented a few times now on how im not as pretty as i used to be.

139,"*Whoops there goes gravity.* I'm sort of freaking out because I was talking to someone I trust earlier and she remembers a conversation we had a good deal differently than I do. I take her word for it because she has no motivation to lie about it and it's freaking me out a lot. I have lots of memories of being abused as a child and my parents tried to gaslight me my whole life. I have a horrible memory from my substance use issues. I know for a fact that my mom did things like scream about how she wished she never had me and scream that she'd kill herself if I left the house to get coffee instead of staying so she could hurl insult after brutal insult at me. I feel like if I wasn't in therapy at the time of this I'd probably already doubt that that even happened. My mom swears it never happened. The further back I go the less I trust my memory. I have a lot of memories of my childhood but I pretty much have a hard time believing anything from my childhood even happened at all, or even most of my teen years for that matter. I occasionally get this paranoia that reality is so far apart from what I think that I'd never be able to tell. What if people I used to know never existed and I just spent that time babbling to myself like a lunatic? It's not a thought I take too seriously or have often but it just shows how extreme my paranoia and distrust of my own sense can go. I also had an abusive ex boyfriend but I spend all this time agonizing of which details really happened and it was about a year ago when I dumped him. I feel sick to my stomach of the silliest conversation right now. She probably has no idea I'm freaking out about that little misunderstanding hours later and honestly I don't want to tell her because I want honesty so I can my basic abilities of understanding reality and if I tell her she might be afraid to correct me if I say something and she said it didn't happen like that at all.

may 11th 2018 i overdosed for the second time. i bought 32 paracetamol pills along with a bottle of water and swallowed them all walking along the beach. 
the first time i overdosed it took me three months to be able to drink water again. 
this time it’s taking 9+ months. everytime i drink it i taste the pills and it makes me want to throw up. 
i’m great mentally now, i’ve never been so happy in life, but i’m so dehydrated. i’m exhausted and the bags under my eyes are disturbingly dark. i drink possibly a glass of orange juice if even that a day. 
i can’t bring myself to drink tap water or bottled water. i drink orange juice or flavoured sparkling water. but it’s becoming expensive and tedious having to constantly go out and buy something so i’m able to stay just a little hydrated. 

i do aerial hoop + yoga + a lot of walking, i’m trying to lose fat yet not keeping hydrated is preventing this.

I am tired of dealing with my brain. I'll explain why.

First, I can't ""sit"" or quiet my mind: I'm always thinking about TONS of stuff: from university to friendships, sentimental life, feelings, insecurities etc. This brings me to not being able to focus on anything: while I'm studying, I'm also texting friends,watching videos, playing with a cable, dancing, reading stuff = I'm not really productive. This also brings me to forgetting a ton of things: from simple things like taking my dog out or doing housework for my mom, or favours, to big stuff.

I've tried talking about it with a couple psychologists and they both said it may be caused by the fact that 3 years ago, when I was 16, my dad died because of a motorcycle crash. I don't see how it can cause such problems,also because I've been struggling with this for as long as I can remember, but I won't question it because I'm no doctor. The fact is I wasn't given a solution. I was just told ""ok, this is the cause""... so what? What now? What should I do to solve this stuff?

Second: I get overwhelmed by EVERYthing. Everything makes me anxious, whether it is some work I need to do, or studying, or just social interactions, I always fear disappointing people or just doing or saying the wrong things, and this makes me restless and unable to just relax and think about nothing for a while, with my chest feeling crushed and my head hurting while I think about stuff I've done, I'm doing and I will do. I'm never too sure what to answer to people in conversations or texts, or how to act or anything at all.

153,"I'm 18 and been worried if I'm a narcissist or not for a bit now. Constant worries, I really don't want to be one. It would shatter my world if it came to that.

I recently watched a video about someone explaining covert narcissism. Even though there were some traits that I didn't have, he explained a lot of traits that I do or used to have. For example inferiority, low self esteem, superficial interests (I want to be a successful musician), chronic boredom, internet addiction, knowledge often limited to trivia etc.

I'm starting to get a bit convinced that I am a covert narcissist. A lot of these traits have gone away though, I used to absolutely resent myself. Thought I was absolutely worthless, no desire to life and I was depressed with a panic disorder (about 3 years ago at 15 years old). It has gotten a little bit better over the past year but still deal with a lot of anxiety. I might believe in myself a little bit more as well, I'm not as miserable as I was before.. but I'm starting to believe I can't change more since narcissists usually can't change their lifestyle and the way of thinking.

I'm so afraid. I'm so afraid that if I ever got in a relationship I would hurt them. I'm so afraid that my ambition to being a good music producer is just my way of coping with my lack of self esteem. I'm afraid that I can't change. I want to have more self esteem, I've always had very little self esteem almost all my life. I'm so afraid.

There are a few traits that I do NOT have such as having delinquent tendencies, hating authority (I don't mind being told what to do), disregard of others, pathological lying, nagging, being forgetful of names. But I tend to focus on the ones I do have for some reason.

The man in the video also said that covert narcissists are prone to have other anxiety disorders.. and that's what I have. I have diagnosed health anxiety. He also said that the cause can happen in adolescence and can be due to many things and one of those being social rejection.. (I never many real friends really).

I'm so afraid that if I tried to be better I wouldn't be able to. I want really badly to have a better self esteem, I want to be more extroverted, I really do.. but after seeing this video about covert narcissists my motivation broke and I am back to feeling miserable. Feeling like I can't change and I'm stuck with being a narcissist and low self esteem for the rest of my life.

156,"It's day 12 of visiting my family. I don't know what exactly is wrong, but it's really bad. I'm losing my mind and don't know what to do. I have to stay here until I passed my drivers test.

Loneliness is eating me alive. The few friends I had in this town moved away. So now I'm stuck in the boondocks with my family. My mum is super busy with work at the moment and hasn't talked to me really since I arrived. I don't know how, but she always invites friends over when there would have been a chance of us having some family time.

I'm alone with my grandma most of the time. I'm supposed to take care of her, since she suffers from memory loss/dementia. I'm nice and positive infront of her, but it's actually mind-numbing. She keeps asking me the same six questions over and over. I make food for her and the others, but they never eat much if they appear to dinner at all.

It's painfully boring. There's nothing to do except for basic housechores noone else would bother doing (cooking, yard work, gardening and walking the dog). So I do them and get nothing but utter ungratefulness in return. We have no conversations whatsoever. My grandma just rambles and complains and my mum doesn't talk to me at all, except for when she has more requests or needs to tell me a little story from work to remind me how stressful her life is.

I've felt my mental health declining even before I came here, but it's gone rapidly downhill ever since. Even when there's noone sleeping and I could play piano or draw, I can't get myself to produce anything meaningful anymore. I can't focus long enough. I silently start crying at least once a day, during cooking or infront of the piano. Most of the time I go unnoticed, when my mum's around she keeps doing whatever she's doing anyways, even when I'm having a breakdown. It's not that she doesn't care, she's just too caught up in work. 

And I feel more strained every day, but can't seem to do anything. It feels like something is gripping my whole body tightly and I need to scream or hurt myself to get rid of it (what I don't intend to do). I don't know how to deal with it. There's no sane and trustworthy adult near me, just old people who silently judge everyone. The only reasonable person is my mum, but she's never around and her support doesn't go further than saying ""You should go see the doctor again. Make an appointment next week and get some medicine."".

I really love my mom and everyone does, which makes me feel even more guilty for feeling neglected. I'm 18 and have lived on my own for half a year, so she doesn't have to take care of me. I just thought she'd be a little welcoming, as she said she was really looking forward to seeing me. But now there are always other people around or work to do and her smile vanishes as soon as the phone calls end and the last guest closed the door behind him. There's no bit of conversation left when it's just the two of us. And I wonder if everything else was just a facade she's keeping up for other people or if that is her ""true self"" and she's just doesn't know what to do with me anymore.

Three days ago I popped one of my grandma's pills. It was a highly-dosed antidepressant. Didn't help with anything of course. I passed out in the living room and woke up three hours later to my mum asking me if I'd had a good nap. I kept falling asleep at the dinner table, but noone really bothered too much. My mum just talked about the flu season and how she was feeling a little queasy, too. My little brother later pretended he'd caught the ""flu"" off of me, so my mum would feed him milk and honey and sit by his freshly made bed. That kid takes advantage of anything.

I want to leave, but can't. I wish I'd be better at talking about my mental health. My mum knows I'm not really doing well, but she's too busy and can't pick up signs. Last week I had a panic attack at night and she tried to comfort me, but fell asleep halfway through. I just feel like a selfish, unfocused mess. I'm tired all the time but can't sleep. Hungry all the time, but my stomach is continuously aching. I'm really fed up with everyone expecting me to be kind, understanding and helpful but never reciprocating anything. It's sad how people get so depressed (gran) or stressed (mum), they start accepting it as their default mode and expect nothing else of other people. The've told me several times that my state of mind is somewhat normal. It discourages me from getting help. I want to be a happy, productive person, but I don't know how to become one and I've realized that noone cares whether I do. At this point I realized my family values success and people-pleasing over ones own happiness. I never want to live their way, but I already am.",26Feb2019,1
157,"So to give you all some background, I crashed about a year and a half ago, failed second year of high school and got on sick leave in september last year, basically right after school started cause I was on the edge of crashing again. 

I changed schools in January so I can now study from home. The problem is.. I have a terrible depression and anxiety. As a side effect I'm constantly tierd and pretty dull minded. Like a slow thinker. I forget things almost immediately and I can't multi task. 

I used to be a heavy book worm and artist but now I can barley read a novel. My school requiers me to do a lot of research from home and attened classes over the internet. But everytime I try to do something I feel almost dyslexic and I can't focus. My psychologist though it sounded kinda strange for someone who has finished 600p books in two weeks before to not be able to read ONE article and summon it up in another document. Yes. It is that bad. 

I'm so scared I'll get all run-down again. That'd be the third time...  All this anxiety and stress is getting up to me. I have a side job - which I totally love and I'm really good at. I just feel like I'd be so much better off dropping out of school and focus on my work. 

Edit; But I'm really scared about what people will say if I don't finish high school. I'm 18 so I can drop out if I want to. I dont want to disappoint my parents but this is such a struggle to be now. I can't deal with another crash and break. I don't want to be permanently broken just because I pushed myself to hard. 

I'm sorry if I come of as a bit confusing. I just can't think very straight",26Feb2019,1
158,"I’m 25 and I lack common sense. It’s affecting my self esteem. I don’t go out much because of it. I feel like I’ll embarrass my self with my stupidity and social awkwardness. For example, my brother told me to tie a knot to hold something. I tried but failed. My brother said “how is it hard?” My supervisor told me to manually wrap a pallet and I started from the top instead of the bottom. Lastly, my supervisor told me to get her last report but she left. I couldn’t find her so I gave it to the manager. Without thinking it was done. Long story short, she said why would you give her my unfinished report? I have to finish it. I couldn’t give her a response. Every time I’m approached with doing something or figuring stuff out that is simple, I fail at it. My brain freezes whenever I do something.

159,"First off here are my extreme beliefs 

Antinatalism 

Everyone over the age of 18 who is still alive is a psychopath.

People will ignore pessimistic ideas or things even though it's part of the equation. 

Religion is an opioid for the masses

There is no free will.

Western governments hold off on information for the public because that information is pessimistic or nihilistic. 

The world is nihilistic. 

Religion in today's world isn't even that big of a deal for control. Modern technology controls people even better mentally and physically. 

We all are numbers, good luck surviving. 
Security has taken over freedom 

Science leads to nihilistic thoughts, so post modernism has taken the lead to prevent that freedom of thought. 

Controlling biology is the best way to control people 
Using societal pressure to influence ideas.


There is no bad or good. Only lucky and unlucky. 
Never feel bad about anything. There is no free will. You are a slave. 

If you just so happen to get in front of a more powerful person's agenda, you will get consequences. 

All morals are permitted and power is the name of the game.

161,"For the past few months I have been freaking out because I saw a Reddit thread about the NSA and how much data the government collects on people. Essentially the thread detailed how they can see literally all of your internet history since the beginning of time, all your downloads, they can listen to you through your phone, etc. Since then I've felt paranoid that someone is basically watching every move I make, and I feel stressed out every time I have to use my phone.

I don't do anything illegal (other than occasionally streaming a movie online I guess) but the thought of someone watching everything I'm doing fills me with fear and anxiety.

162,"I've recently gone through some severe emotional trauma, most of which I feel I brought on myself. I hurt some people around me and they retaliated and now it's just become this severe anxiety in my head where I want to get back at them, but obviously, continuing this cycle of negativity won't do anyone any good. Problem is, one particular person I'm involved with in this scenario works where I work....Everytime I see them, it triggers me and I go down this rapid spiral of panic and manic thoughts and unstable mood. 

I keep seeing these people in my head, laughing at me, saying I deserve what I'm getting...I feel the need to severely harm myself and others...I feel like I want to break down and cry or lash out. It's nuts, and I don't like it and I wish I could make it stop. 

I realize my mental health has caused great heartache for others, especially in relationships. I've been called so many negative things by my last two exes, which were my most intense and unstable relationships. I don't know why things spiralled like they did over the last few years, but that's how this cookie crumbled. 

I just want to be able to forgive myself for having hurt those around me and I want to never do it again. 

Maybe I'm looking for advice. Maybe I want to know that I'm not a piece of shit and I can get better. 

My recent ex says I'm a sociopath and that there's no hope for me. I want this to not be the case. 

I'm sorry. I know you guys are strangers, but I owe someone an apology and communication with my exes is not a good idea. 

Thanks for the help. If I get shit, then hey. Guess that's confirmation I'm a hopeless case. ",26Feb2019,2
163,Today I found out my parents have been talking to my therapist about me without my knowledge. They’ve essentially been using him to push their ideas into therapy sessions and I’m really pissed off. I met my therapist through them and assumed that we had a professional relationship in the sense that there would be no discussion between him and my parents about me. Apparently that’s not the case and they’ve corresponded through emails about me. I don’t know if he has specifically given them details about our sessions however I do know that he’s been taking their ideas and pushing them on me in sessions. I’m really fucking pissed about this and I don’t know what to do. My parents made me feel like I was overreacting but I don’t think so at all. Am I in the right on this? What should I do?,26Feb2019,7

165,"Hi guys, I recently came upon an old journal I wrote over 2 years ago, I wrote this in high school. I find it very depressing, I don't know, have a read--tell me what you think about the person who wrote this:

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can't accomplish the work in front of me; however, I must. I must prove to myself that I can do whatever needs to be done. The work I must do isn't just for myself, It's for my future. It's for Keanna. So far, I've gotten a fair amount of work done; however, I still notice my brain hinting negative thoughts, thoughts that are telling me that I wont be able to complete my work, that I won't be able to memorize the list that I have in front of me. That I don't have what it takes, that I'll be too tired to memorize the list of words for my class. I feel like I may not be able to complete my work. I must end this negative mentality.. I have all night to complete my work. I'm giving myself a deadline of no deadline, I will complete the work given in front of me before its due date. I think that it's too much, I think that I won't have the energy to complete it, I must end these negative feelings and complete the work. I need to realize that I have it within me to do whatever I set my mind to, I just need to set my mind on it, that's the hard part. I keep thinking that I can't complete the work, that it's too much, that it's too tiring, that it's too grueling, I need to end this mentality. I keep thinking it's just too much. I need to keep going. Again, I'm not doing this for myself, I'm doing this for the people I love, for Keanna. I love her so much, I can never get my mind off of her; well, I can actually, otherwise I wouldn't be able to do my work :p. I need to stay focused, I must not stop. Studies have shown that it takes at least 30 minutes to get back into the mindset of working once distracted, I must not let that be me, I've let that be me for far too long. I must not let the negativity envelop me, I must fight through the discomfort, for it is the fight through the pain that makes me grow. The whole purpose of life is to become the best version of yourself; therefore, I must work hard to become the best version of myself. It's 8:19 as I'm typing this. I must keep going, I must stay focused. I have negative voices in my head telling me that it's too much, that it's too tiring, and that I should just lay down the couch behind me and ""relax"". I must not fall into that trap, that habit has wasted so much time, so much opportunities. Maybe, even, ruined my chance with Keanna when I was younger. I cannot let that happen anymore, I want to know that by the end of everyday, that I've grown. I want the things that I desire, and I must remind myself that this discomfort, this pain, is what will get me there, I must embrace it. I must think of Keanna every time I feel this way; for this is the only way I may be able to get her back into my life, and maybe, even be in a relationship with her, which is something I truly desire. I'm feeling as if I can't complete the assignment again, I feel like I can't understand it.. or grasp it. I must complete the work in front of me. I don't think I understand it.. I feel confused. I don't think I have what it takes to complete the assignment. However, I must complete my given assignment. Remember, this is not just for you.. I feel confused, I feel like it's too much for me. I feel like I don't have what it takes to finish my work, I feel like my brain isn't working right. I need to complete my given work, and I will. Although it may seem complicated, I will complete my assignment. I will complete it. I have three sections left, I can do it. Ill do it for Keanna. I feel like I can't focus on reading, I feel like I can't comprehend the material, I feel stupid, I must read and comprehend this assignment. I know I can. I feel retarded, I feel like I can't comprehend anything. I feel like this section of my work is too complicated, it may have to do with the fact that I took a break; however, that shouldn't be an excuse.. I need to keep working, I need to understand this. I feel like I don't know what exactly to write, I don't know what is necessarily important and what is not, and it's frustrating. I will eventually figure it out.. I just need to stay focused and stop letting these negative thoughts get to me.. they're distracting me and overall hindering my ability to comprehend the content contained in this textbook. I'm finally getting back to work, after spending sometime listening to ASMR, attempting to nap, and watching some ""how to know if a girl likes you"" videos. I feel like I'm ready to get back into this, I'm primarily typing this right now to get my mind back into gear. I was thinking about the girls at my new school, and thinking about the ones that may possibly seek interest in me. I'm not too sure though, although I'd love to find myself an attractive and sweet girl to get to know, hopefully that can be soon. I just need to gain some confidence, something that I've been lacking in since the third grade. I'm honestly not looking too forward to working, but it's part of growing, which is essential to life.. which, again, I need to start embracing. Fucking APUSH man, I don't understand how a class assigns this much work.. I'm already in the mentality that I'm not going to get every thing done. It doesn't even seem right, there's just so much. I guess that just means I have to be very discipline in my schedule. I'm going to try not to get too mad at myself for not being able to complete everything, Ill get the hang of it eventually, and I will succeed the class indefinitely, as well as all my other classes. I'm anxious about first period tomorrow, I've had so many missing days, I know I'm already super behind, and my teacher probably hates me already. Oh boy, I can't wait for first period. I need to start working, I want to at least get the first chapter done, that way maybe I can go to the gym and meditate in the sauna, and follow that up with some exciting APUSH vocabulary memorization :D. I really hope I get to know a cute girl at my school soon, I feel like I need it.. A friend, but a girlfriend! I don't know, I just don't desire to have a guy friend at the moment, primarily because I don't see the point. At least with a girlfriend there's a possibility we can become intimate, which is something I really want. Again, however, I don't want to allow an intimate relationship to distract me from doing the day to day tasks I need to perform everyday. Alright, I need to get working. I can type my inner thoughts forever. My day has started; evidently, I got up super duper late. 8:00 to be exact. It's okay, I feel like it was meant to happen for a reason. Hell, I didn't even finish my first chapter! I feel like I should be typing that with more shame; however, I do feel like I worked as hard as I could given the circumstance. All I can at this point is learn what I did wrong. One of the things I did wrong is not do any school related work over the weekend, which would've definitely lessened my work-load. In addition, my lack of work Monday through Tuesday can also be attributed to this error. Although I made a few 'stupid' mistakes, I've came up with solution to prevent this problem again. I've decided to keep myself in a routine in which I complete a chapter in my workbook on Saturday and Sunday. In addition, for my thesis tests, I figured I'd read a section of a given chapter a day and write notes on it. I assume achieving completion should only take approximately 30 to 40 minutes. I've missed so much school; however, I know it's for the greater good. I know that I'll eventually make it up.. I know I have it within me. All I need is proper discipline, focus, motivation, and drive. I have negative voices in my head telling me that I have too much work on my plate, and that I won't be able to do it. That I'm not good enough, that I don't have what it takes to complete my given assignment. This is incorrect however, I know I can do it. I need to discipline myself to complete this work. All work is easy work. I just need to imagine Keanna, the most beautiful girl I've seen. She's so beautiful, I swear. I regret not talking to her more when I was around her. I miss her, I know it sounds cheesy, but I'm so in love with her.. as creepy as that sounds! She's one of my forms of motivation, which is why I'm so hesitant to remove her from my desktop screen! I know my mom would probably be freaked out, but it pushes me.. at least I think it does. I need to go train, but I'm still a bit fatigued from my ""all nighter"" earlier. I'm hoping I can complete chapter 2 as soon as I get back from school, and hopefully memorize my vice president names after, while memorizing my vocabulary throughout the day. I have so much I have to do, but Ill get used to it. Ill survive, I have greatness within me. I know that through this work and discomfort, and through this pain, Ill be one step closer to obtaining the things I've always desired, the wealth, Keanna, vitality, prosperity, happiness. I know I will achieve these things though my dedication towards working hard.. I still have negative thoughts telling me that I don't have what it takes, and that I'm not good enough, and that I'll just fatigue and never accomplish anything, and that this phase will go away eventually and that I'll end up back in square one, the person I was on Monday, the person I was while I was dating Tatum. I will not allow these negative thoughts affect me, I know within I'm strong, and I refuse to let myself down, I refuse to not allow myself to grow. I will ensure that every day, no matter what, I grow. That I become a better person than I was the day prior. That I learn something new, that I see a new perspective, that I work harder than I did before, that I increase my drive and motivation. I know I can do this... I want to do it for my beautiful Keanna, I love her dearly. I hope that one day I get to see her, hopefully soon. Well, at least once my hair grows out more. I want my hair to grow so that I can get it aligned with the shape of my head! I figured out that I have a triangular shaped head.. which is funny because short hairstyles don't go well that shape! You see where I'm going with this, I've had short haircuts almost all of my life. I prefer it short because there is less work to be done to it. But why shouldn't I want to look like the best version of myself possible? If I find myself feeling bad for ""not looking good enough"", then i should be at least trying my hardest to making myself looking more presentable, not just having a great physique. Okay, I need to eat and then head to the gym, Ill come back in later in the day, to discuss what happened I guess, and how I feel. I enjoy doing this, I think it's a good way for myself to express my deep-inner emotions..",26Feb2019,1
