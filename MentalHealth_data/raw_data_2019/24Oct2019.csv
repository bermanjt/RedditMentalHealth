0,To anyone who sees this: Hello. I have had depression and anxiety for years now and I don't know for sure if it's gone. Any advice?,24Oct2019,1
1,"can you still have depression but not feel worthless?

i have depression but most of the time i know people love and care for me. only my family though because that's the only people i interact with, maybe if i had other people i would think i was worthless but my family obviously love and care for me. i mean sometimes i think they secretly hate me and think i'm weird and annoying haha.",24Oct2019,3
2,"I (17m) have just graduated high school and am amidst the HSC, i think similar to GCSE and SAT’s. I have started seeing a psychiatrist over the last months, having had 4 or 5 sessions total. She diagnosed me with OCD and social phobia, as well as depression and possible ADD. I started seeing her as I was finding it hard to function socially as I felt no one could appreciate that it was hard for me to believe people are my friends, and was having a hard time grasping reality, at times lapsing into a “Truman Show”-esque view of the world. I get intrusive thoughts and find it extremely hard to start tasks i have to complete until the last minute. I find it really hard to make decisions by myself and shape most of my personality on who i’m around at any given time, letting them make decisions for me. My biggest issue is that i analyse absolutely everything about myself and everything around me, and have a complete lack of sense of self. At my last session, my therapist brought up Lexapro, saying that she thinks it might help to just take some of the stress away from my normal daily functioning and help me relax a little bit. I am very sentimental about everything, so this feels like i’m giving into my mental illness and makes me feel guilty for not being able to beat it myself. On top of this, I waver in and out of believing myself, often believing i am making all of this up for attention. My dad asked if i really thought i needed it and my mum is opposed to medication overall, but they would both be supportive if i decided i wanted to go ahead with medication. Does anyone have any experience with similar illnesses or symptoms and have tried medication? 

TLDR: 17m with OCD and social phobia, depression and possibly ADD. Therapist proposed trying Lexapro but my mental illnesses are getting in the way of my decision making. Any experiences with lexapro or similar medications welcome. Thanks for reading and helping.",24Oct2019,2
3,"*This post is to raise awareness, not ask for advice.*

I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 13 after ten grueling years of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my father. Like anyone new to mental health awareness, I thought that eventually, I would be ""cured."" But like most mental illnesses, PTSD is a lifelong uphill battle. 

We need to talk about it. I'm so happy to see that there has recently been more discussion of it, but we need to take in all the details so that we can recognize it when we see it. 

Symptoms include but are not limited to: 

1. Hypervigilance 
2. Flashbacks
3. Nightmares
4. Comorbid anxiety and depression
5. Avoidance behaviors (like avoiding loud bangs or familiar scenery)
6. Aggression/self-destructive behaviors

According to the DSM5, there is also a ""Preschool subtype"" for juveniles and a ""Dissociative subtype"" for people experiencing depersonalization/derealization as a direct effect of trauma. 

So, what's your story? What's your symptoms? How do you deal with them?

Always, if you have any of these symptoms, please make your way over to a therapist's office and begin treatment. PTSD is a hard one to deal with - I've likened it to having cancer of the memory. But once you've come to grips with your symptoms and become aware of what's happening, coping becomes much easier. 

There is hope.

6,It seems like my depression can suddenly get a lot worse out of nowhere and it's happening right now. Except it's worse than usual. I don't want to suffer this badly anymore. I have an incredible life but I've always been mentally ill and I want it to fucking stop. I want the pain to go away. I can barely function right now and I feel like I'm going to have a mental breakdown. For the past few days I've had an insane amount of energy and struggled to sleep. Now I just want to sleep forever.,24Oct2019,8
7,"Not literally. I know the words. I know how to press a send button. But I can't get myself to do it. I have people around me who promised me I can reach out unconditionally, but fuck me backwards, I can't. So I end up miserable. Bottling up all of this stupid shit. I also do my best not to lash out at people when I'm emotionally charged, but at this point I've bottled up so much fucking anger I just need this one worthy outlet and I'll unleash it and hurt not only the people around me but me as well. I'm sick and tired of it. Of staying in bed all the time. Of being unable to make a one minute phone call to take care of something. Of not only being unable to love, but also not knowing how to receive it, the thought of romance makes me sick, I want to create so much stuff, I feel like the only thing I was blessed with is a creative mind, but what is it even worth if I can't do anything with it? The thought of death is my only solace, so knowing I probably won't kill myself just makes me even more depressed. People have been oblivious and always doubted my mental issues to such a degree that now I doubt myself and feel guilty even mentioning my mental health is rotten to the core. So to combat this I've become absolutely obsessed with it and all I can do is sit at home and read about different definitions, going to doctors begging them to print out my medical file, bringing up my research with people I'm close to, but it's all worth jack shit, I feel like it can't get better. And even if it does, it will come around the corner again and slap me across the face. I don't want to be dependent on a pill. I'll be 22 soon and I feel like life is slipping away. I can't eat for shit. I don't want to eat. It's not fun. I'm skinny, I want to look better, and I can't.  And the sweet cherry on top: I'm functional. I look well. I smile to people, I seem to be engaging, I try to at the very least, and it only makes me feel like people are taking my problems less seriously. ""I would have never guessed"" - this functional depression is merely an illusion. When I'm home, I'm stuck in bed, hating myself and fantasizing about covering myself in my own blood. But no man, it's just a part of growing up, right? I'm not mentally sick, I'm just growing up. And that's all. Or so they tell me.",24Oct2019,2
8,"I guess I just want to hear about other people’s honest experience with depression? I naturally try to be optimistic that things will get better and everyone encourages you that you should and that they will. But I try to work on myself or whatever and nothing ever changes long term. Sometimes things are really good for a while and I’ll think it’s a breakthrough, but then the crash back to feeling like this afterwards is even worse. I’m only in my twenties but I think I’ve just always been prone to feeling shitty for a while. I know I’m young though so I try to stay hopeful this is just a stage in my life. but I can’t help but feel like not everyone gets to “work through it”. I don’t even know what to try at this point because nothing feels like it would make me happy enough to get out of this cycle. I’m just worried that there’s people who try the best they can but just have to struggle through this their entire life, and that I’m one of these people. I don’t know if I should keep hoping I’ll be good one day. I want to and plan to. But a part of me wonders if at some point down the road I’ll just have to accept how my brain works and just hope things only get so bad. Would just be helpful to hear a candid perspective from others who are older and wiser than me who have felt the same. whether you found a way that works or never did.",24Oct2019,1
9,"My whole life I have been too sensitive to everything around me. I have been so alive that it’s been hard, it’s ruined my life. I can’t think straight. The moment I clear my mind, I feel the fabric of my clothes against my skin constantly tickling me, in many, many spots. I notice how remarkably starving I am, I notice how awful I really feel. I am so alive. The world is so crisp to me, I feel so stuck. I can’t think straight for more than a minute. I’ve developed an awful, awful ego overtime to deal with it. I feel that I can’t live in the real world anymore, I am trapped in my imagination anymore, it’s made me a terrible person. It’s gone so far that I’ll look at things, such as floor mats and doors, and see moving images of people, trees, and grass, which can look photo realistic at times. I become enthralled my them, and I start to believe that I have something special, and that I’m a genius, but then I calm down and feel embarrassed for even thinking that, for being so delusional. I feel so terrified, I have opened up a door that I have gone through and passed far too long ago. I am 18 years old, and I feel both a thousand years old and VERY childish at the same time. I feel very guilty. I feel both remarkably intelligent and incredibly awful, awfully dumb, retarded. My eyes are crossed sometimes, but sometimes they are so focused that people have laughed and made comments in surprise at it. I have no idea who I am or what’s going on, but I know exactly who I am and what’s going on. I really don’t know what I can do anymore. I just feel like somebody will comment ‘what a weird post’, and move on, and then I will feel even more isolated, and have more and more irrational hate for myself and everybody else. I just feel very twisted and ill. I just want somebody to talk to me and tell me exactly what they think, because I don’t know what I think.

11,i have gone though 2 really good relationships because i let my mind take over. i tend to think they are cheating on me or want to or are going to and i'm not supportive of their new friendships because i'm afraid they will leave me for them. I'm critical of the decisions they make and i have a bad habit of telling them everything i'm thinking without holding back....even the bad stuff. when they do something i don't like i tend to shut down and just tell them to leave me alone and i ghost them. i always feel bad after i settle for a bit. I don't like that i'm like this. My first real relationship wasn't like this i was in a good place starting college and i had best friends i spent time with when ever i could but i moved 1000 miles away from my best friends and from the girlfriend that i was with over a year ( we only broke up because i couldn't see her and i found a new girlfriend). But i'm really alone out here and i think that's one of the reasons i have become this way again...i say again because when i was younger i dated a girl online and i had these same issues but i  didn't have any friends at that time. I believe i know where these issues are coming from i'm alone and i'm scared i don't have anyone to fall back on out here or even hangout with. I only ever hung out with my girlfriends out here. I need help i really do i cant let another relationship die because im like this i want to fix myself i want to trust them with all my heart. this last break up was only yesterday and i really lost someone i wanted to spend my life with. i wont let it happen again. i need help.,24Oct2019,4
12,"Hello everybody hope you're doing okay today,

I am going to try and keep this as straight forward as possible and spare you the details - 

I am a 19 year old transgender male, lately my mental health has taken a decline I wasn't expecting.  I came out in 2017 and have been on hormones for over two years, I genuinely love my reflection.  I never thought I would actually be handsome, I am in great physical shape, muscular.  Every month I fill out more and more into the man I always thought should be looking back at me in the mirror.

However in light of lots of other trauma throughout my life - I am not doing too well in other regards.  Basically, the only thing that truly keeps me going is the thought of what Ill be one year from now.  Given that a year ago today, I thought I looked amazing.  Now looking back, I think wow I thought I looked good then, now I look way better.  I can't imagine what the future holds in that superficial regard.  I keep my transition very private, I don't share things with others.  This is truly a personal journey.  

With death, burglary, emancipation from parents, etc etc. I find myself very depressed.  I'm not enjoying life and haven't in some time.  I want to love life, and my mother (being my only support system) is urging me to see a professional psychiatrist.  I've tried very hard to not need medication, but Ive realized I can't fix this on my own.  I need some help.

My concern is this: a professional is going to try and stop my transition.  I am utterly terrified of a professional seeing my from a third party perspective and assuming I made a mistake in my transition.  My mother thinks Im making an excuse to not get help, but I genuinely fear this.  This transition saved my life, when I was a 17 year old ""girl"" who didn't understand anything.  I said I can either kill myself, or fight.  So I fought, and here I am some years later and Ive definitely made a lot of progress.  Of course, I'm not perfect, but Ive made a lot of steps.  I just want to be happier, and I now understand I need to swallow my pride and reach out for help.

I fear that a professional will think they know me better than I know myself, I fear they will do something to stop my hormones or make it impossible for me to continue on my transition.  As early as 4 years old I started praying that god would allow me to wake up the boy I wanted to be.  I hung with the boys, wore boy clothes, played xbox and shot airsoft.

I was wondering if any FTM or and licensed professional had any insight on this.  Do I have anything to worry about?  Is it likely that they will understand that the cause of my issue right now is actually other mental illness?  I know people look down on self diagnosis, but Im very self aware and I have spent years doing research.  I am very confident I have OCD and OCPD.  PTSD from a home burglary, and of course lots of anxiety and depression.  Please don't judge my self diagnosis, this is just what I confidently believe and I am interested in professional help.  I simply fear that they'll try and stop my transition. 

I fear this because obviously (and rightfully so) they take a lot of steps to make sure you're making the right decision.  I went through many months of therapy to get my letter for hormones.  She had no doubt in her mind that I knew myself but it is law to get a letter.  I know a lot of young kids are making the decision to transition right now, there is no doubt in my mind a lot of them are doing it for the wrong reasons.  I understand that it's possible people confuse their feelings for dysphoria, when it is not the root of their problem.  Especially with the rise of #ftm and the rise of ""internet fame"" especially surrounding queer folk.  I totally understand the worry about making the right decision

However as I stated previously, my transition is not something I use for likes or followers.  I don't even speak to people about it, I lost all my friends because of it, lost my father for good because of it.  I sacrificed a lot, and I did it for no other reason than being true to myself.  I know myself better than I know anybody, and better than anybody knows me.  I take pride in that.  I honestly really do love myself, and this isn't something I could have said honestly pre transition.  This transition has been my saving grace, so I hope you understand my fear when it comes to what they might say when I reach out about my other mental illnesses.  

I would greatly appreciate insight on what you guys think.  Have any FTMs experienced this where they try and make you stop because they think you made the wrong decision?  Have any professionals had trans people come to them with other mental issues and have you been able to look past their trans status and just work with them on those particular issues?

Thank you so much

Hope you have a good evening",24Oct2019,2

I’m looking for communities to join in order to seek help and advice, and help others. I’m diagnosed with BPD, and tonight I relapsed for the first time in months. I saw a psychiatrist last week, he said I should be questioning why I need to see one as I can see, hear and talk, therefore I have it a lot better than other people. 

I’ve been fighting for 9 years for help, and it’s still carrying on. Who knows when I’ll receive it?

15,"I never imagined that I'd be writing about my problems on reddit, but I don't have anyone to go to anymore.

In the past week I've lost my best friend as well as  all of my other friends. My best friend and my friend group were at odds due to a lot of drama that happened last year, but I always stayed friends with her because she was always kind to me and the friendship meant a lot to both of us. We helped each other through some very rough times.

About a month and a half ago I reached out to her to see if we could start hanging out and talking more, as my friend group had gotten very busy and I was getting a bit lonely. We started talking a lot and hanging out nearly every day. I felt happy being around her, which isn't something I had felt in a long time. I'm usually very scared of being happy because it's usually shortly followed by emotionally devastating events. I thought that things might be different this time, and I wanted to open myself up and be closer to this person. We shared a lot of our fears and problems, memories and dreams. I decided to trust her, and we assured each other that we'd always be there for each other. 

Well, a few weeks in my friend group found out that I had been talking to her a lot and asked me to stop talking to her. I decided to keep talking to her, because I wasn't going to return the kindness she had shown me by hurting her, regardless of the issues it would cause between my friends and I. This ended up in me losing them as friends. I didn't tell her about this.

It was around this time that I realized that I had romantic feelings for my best friend. And, despite my better judgement, I decided to tell her about this because I didn't want there to be any dishonesty between us. I trusted that it wouldn't change our friendship, even though she wasn't interested in a relationship at the moment. And things seemed ok at first. We'd have periods of a week or so where we didn't talk because she needed time to deal with everything mentally, which I was ok with and supportive of.

A week ago out of nowhere I woke up to a long message about ending our friendship due to not being comfortable talking to me while I was still friends with the people who had hurt her the year prior, and was removed off of everything. I wasn't even friends with them anymore due to choosing her over them. She didn't want them to spread rumors about her leading me on and things similar, even though I had expressed being fine with just being friends and not expecting anything more than that.

She knew that I had dealt with a lot of emotional trauma in the past dealing with similar situations, and I had just gotten over an abusive relationship where I had opened up and gotten taken advantage of and emotionally abused. It feels like I was abandoned and tossed away by the person I cared about the most, and was led to believe that the feeling was mutual.

I sent a message explaining that I wasn't friends with them anymore, and that I was more than happy to not be anything more than friends, but she doesn't seem to care and I haven't heard back from her.

The past couple years have been nothing but heartbreak and disappointment for me. I don't feel like I'll ever be happy again. The brief moments where it seems like something might go well for me are quickly met with something that knocks me down for a long time. I have nobody to talk to now, and I can't even go to the gym without having a panic attack and feeling like I should just throw myself into traffic after leaving the building. I haven't been able to eat anything in a week, and I only really get out of bed to feed my cats. Being abandoned by the one person I thought I could trust has thoroughly broken me. I can't even bring myself to cancel reservations on the trip that we had planned in a couple weeks. 

Can't afford therapy due to being a broke college student, so I'm not too sure what to do. Sorry for the long post.",24Oct2019,2
16,"Welp. Every week it’s something new it seems. This week has seen all but the end of the rest of my social life. A week ago I went on the most amazing date with the most amazing woman and we both (seemingly) had a good time. A few days later I got some unsolicited texts from my abusive cheating ex. Needless to say I was done with her shit and blocked her on every platform I could think of. She didn’t like that too much it seemed and she told all my friends something (I’m not sure what but a pack of lies I’m sure) which prompted them to remove me from their social media and have since stopped talking to me. My parents, as lovely as they are, are always butting heads. My father is an adultering recovering alcoholic and my mother has clinical rage issues stemming from childhood. Last night they had some fight and I told them I didn’t want to hear their fighting as it was getting a bit much. They didn’t like that and just argued more and more. Eventually my mum apologized but it’s the same old cycle, scream, verbally attack everyone, apologize later, rinse and repeat. And so tonight, remember that amazing woman? She no showed and then texted me at the time we were supposed to meet saying she can’t make it. Then left it ambiguous and said maybe she can come later but isn’t sure. It’s not the first time she’s cancelled on a whim, but I thought we were past that. And here I sit, alone at a table for two, on reddit, with no friends to hang out with, not really any family, and no date anymore it seems. I have nothing. I have no one. If anyone wants to reach out it would really help an old soul out. I could just use some human contact of any sort. I don’t care what it is. It could be a fact about something stupid.

19,"Hi Reddit, this is my first ever post. Not sure how everything works yet, so please bare with me. 

I’m at a point where hope and faith are just gone. In the past, no matter how big of a hurdle, I always had a voice that reassured me “everything will be okay.” But this time that voice is no longer there. I can’t do anything productive. It’s like I’m bound by chains or stuck with a lead jacket. I literally can’t do anything except sleep, eat, bathroom, and watch videos on YouTube. Whenever I had a spark of inspiration/motivation to work for a better future, life just smacks me back down with these chains and told me that I’m a worthless piece of shit that can’t achieve anything. I rotate between anger, frustration, sadness, and numbness. When I need the most support, my support system is not there to help me through. At the end of the day, it’s me and my bed, soaking up whatever tears and snot that my body can produce. 

As you can probably guess, I most likely have some form of depression. Additionally, I have a fucked up family life. When I hinted about my feelings, they told me to heal myself bc I'm a psych major. My friends and boyfriend have been my only support systems, but I can’t rely on them all the time. Matter of fact, they have told me constantly to seek professional help. This is the problem: I know I need help, but I literally can’t help myself to help myself. I’m cringing even typing all of this out, because I know I should just get a damn grip. But it’s not happening. I’ve had suicidal thoughts multiple times in my life. Yet I cannot bring myself to end it all. Im stuck in a rocking chair of misery.

I suffer from anxiety and depression, but no other illnesses that I’m aware of. I’m suddenly not feeling welcome by my friends. And I think every time they whisper to each other it’s about me. My auditory hallucinations range from music, to people whispering my name or things to me. While my suicidal thoughts are rather intrusive. I don’t really have a desire to kill myself. It’s just that I know that I’m gonna die anyways, and there’s so many ways I could end it for myself. And I could get out of school and other stressful responsibilities if I did die. My homicidal thoughts, or whatever you call them scare me the most. I space out, and suddenly start thinking about what it would be like to beat somebody to death, or some other type of murder. They scare me, I know I’m not going to kill anybody. But they lead me to believe that I’m just gonna become a murderer when I’m older. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I used these Saturday and Sunday night and woke up dry, so I figured it was just a fluke think that happened, so for my Monday appointment I didn't mention that I had wet the bed. But then Monday night I stopped using my self-constructed puppy pad and woke up having peed myself. So I had to do laundry again.  
I got adult diapers from the store and wore them last night (Thursday) but the diaper stayed dry. I'm planning to wear another diaper tonight just in case.  
I've gone off of Seroquel a week ago, and this seroquel withdrawal can include bedwetting, so maybe it'll go away on its own. But I'm also taking Ambien 10mg to help me sleep (what Seroquel previously did). Maybe that's what's causing the bedwetting?

Also Adderall which helps me focus a lot, so my mind isn't scattered everywhere like it used to be, chasing after every new thing and never finishing a project.  
Everyone has things they don't tell their psychiatrist. And for different reasons. I'm seeing him tomorrow. Hopefully I won't wet the bed tonight.

I’ve never had to help someone grieve so I feel kinda useless. I want to be there for him but I also want to give him space to feel on his own and not smother him. What other ways can I be supportive without being overbearing?

Thanks in advance. 💕",24Oct2019,2
27,"So we both have serious issues. She's diagnosed bipolar but I suspect she's borderline. I've never mentioned that to any living soul until this. Anyway I finally got her to seek treatment about six months or so ago and she's been doing a lot better, especially since the suicide attempt. I'm the last week or so, she's undertaken several big jobs around the house, lots of organizing and cleaning, etc. (Manic) I was supportive because I totally dug what she was doing and was genuinely proud of her positive attitude about it, but I knew deep down the crash was going to happen. (Depressive)

About a year ago I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic attacks. I was taking buspar and Ativan (the antidepressants were worse than the depression). Everything was going okay except I kept taking more Ativan than I was supposed to. They take so long to take effect and I also believe my individual constitution is such that regular doses of anything don't work as well for me. So I asked my doc for something that takes effect a little faster. Enter Valium. 

Days 1-4 of this new medication were wonderful for me. I was taking them exactly as prescribed. I was up and about. No trouble with breathing or the God awful dizziness. I also take trazodone for the insomnia. I'm terribly groggy in the mornings from those, but at least I'm finally sleeping. 

To make a short story long, I wake up one afternoon, groggy from the trazodone, (work night shifts) take my meds and start my day. SO comes home, looks at my eyes, assumes I'm fucked up, taking Valium for fun or something, and has been making a huge deal of it ever since. She even called my doctor to say...well I don't know what she said. I can only assume she said I was abusing them. After that I've just been avoiding her. She's gone from way up high now to the pit of anger and unreasonableness. 

We had been so lovey dovey for weeks. Our anniversary was the 15th. Now I just feel dead inside. Am I supposed to stop taking the Valium because she's possibly overreacting? I mean I'm just venting here I guess but if anyone has any pro tips I'm listening.",24Oct2019,1
28,Years back I was put in a mental hospital because I wanted to die. I found some stuff from right before and I was showing clear signs of hallucinations which I've had my whole life. I finally am able to look at the records from my hospital stay where I remember mentioning these hallucinations. They aren't listed anywhere in my files. Along with this my dad was told I had been diagnosed with bi polar which was the reason for me being put on meds. This is listed nowhere in the file. And I'm not bipolar in the slightest.

I’m not going to say our exact age but to be honest we are pretty young and need sleep. I asked him about it and he said he tried to fall asleep but at about 6:00 in the morning he got board and did homework. He also tried to take naps during the day but couldn’t fall asleep even though he was supper tired. I could tell from the way he was texting that he was completely exhausted and out of energy. I’ve had some bad experiences in the past with mental health issues with both me and my other friends (not including this one) and sleep was a huge problem for us.

I come home and everything is a mess and that's already discouraging enough, so I debate with myself for a long time on wether I should clean up the house or not. Then I eat, which is my favourite thing to do each day but then I just suddenly feel so drained and sad. I'm sure I don't have depression because back when I used to have depression it felt way worse than this, but I feel so empty and sad. I do my school work and then by the time I finish, everybody's home. I go downstairs, the dishes are back in the sink, everything is back to being messy, the oven is back to being greasy and the floor is back to being dusty and I absolutely HATE IT.  Then I realize that its time for me to shower but first I have to clean the kitchen and then I feel so... trapped? I feel like I have so many things I need to do.

Right now I'm laying in bed as I'm writing this, I just had a mental breakdown and cried my ass off and now I'm writing this. I decided I'll shower tomorrow morning because I needed to finish my homework first, but then if I shower tomorrow morning I'll have to wake up at 5:30 instead of 6.

36,"I have an appointment unrelated tomorrow and I'm thinking about asking if I can go back on some kind of ADHD medication. 

Problem is, I was diagnosed in the early 2000s and before that, the 90s. 

I've heard ""adults generally outgrow ADHD"" and people have asked ""are you sure you're not just gifted?""

It's problematic. I have very little focus, can't focus on phone calls or face to face conversations- I have to talk via text or I'll zone out. 

I made it to a specialist appointment at the right time, a day late (they took her in anyways since we had to travel out of town) 

I still call my mom to report when I set up appointments to make sure it won't be forgotten- if I think about it, I forget to do it

I have several other reasons ranging from running multiple sites to having a lot of unfinished rough drafts of books I want to publish 

I'm also unsure how untreated ADHD will do further raising an obvious ADHD child- my youngest (3) is JUST LIKE me. It's like staring at my child hood self- all the way from the defiance to her daring nature to her nonstop hyperness (I do NOT want to end up having to medicate her young, they put me on meds that made me sick from the start- I read later on those meds caused seizures in children that young and I am sure I'd have had them if I hadn't complained to my mom who had the doctor take me off them immediately.)

&amp;#x200B;

I do know basics- they need routine, tight schedule, take out red dye as much as possible and cut back on sugar but the routine is hard on me. My mom has been warning me about ADHD meds, but I'm not sure how else I can fully be an adult. I'm able to take care of the kids, hold a job and no areas of my life are neglected- it's just REALLY hard and getting harder as my children are getting older. 

&amp;#x200B;

He’s suffered with some combination of mental health issues for quite some time (OCD, depression, etc.) but has never been diagnosed. He’s held jobs before, but never anything long term. In many ways he’s very intellectual (loves history, reading) but he doesn’t have a college degree.

My parents have been supporting him for years, trying everything in their power to get him to get help. They’ve funded his various endeavours, only for him to lose interest in an activity and blame them for his shortcomings. They still love him dearly, but don’t know how to help him.

Lately he’s moved to London after several years living abroad as a nomad. He’s a UK citizen, but due to paranoia about the government he refuses to do anything that will put him in “the system”. My parents have finally started to cut him off (he could make do without much to begin with) and now he’s basically living day to day, sometimes in the streets. They’re overcome with emotion, and I don’t know how to help them. 

Does anyone have any guidance for how I can help? Specifically in London, are there are services I can recommend he try? Honestly it’s so heartbreaking watching my brother slip into homelessness and disarray. My parents have tried to get him to do the simplest of tasks (register with a GP, go to his local council) but he can’t/won’t do it, and they’ve completely run out of things to try.

  I'm a 22 year old student and for about 5 years now I feel like I'm not experiencing the stress and pressure I feel like everyone should be feeling. From what I understand the feeling of pressure and stress is the body's natural response to the environment and perceived dangers or difficulties ahead. But no matter what the situation, I feel as if I should be feeling some sort of stress or pressure in order to provide that push or motivation, something that I feel is normal to have. However, for example, I had a do or die final exam which determined my fate for my nursing course, I simply did not feel anything while preparing for it. I knew it was coming, I studied and prepared but I just felt a sense of ""Oh, I should be studying, I guess?""  I got the score I needed and passed, so it ended up alright .

 When I talked to my parents about it, they said that it might be because I have a carefree personality, which I agree with, but I do not think I'm pushing myself hard enough and I may have had a mental block somewhere along the line or something though I'm not entirely sure. So my question is, do I need to see a psychologist to help pick my mind or is there a way I could do it myself?

The past few months have been a rollercoaster and a half and I really just want to talk to someone who understands even if only slightly how I'm feeling right now. 

Over the course of my short 20 year life so far, I've had to deal with abuse of a ton of shitty flavors as well as mental illness and a steadily decaying state if mind. I was beat and verbally abused through my childhood so I could ""be a man"" and grow up stronger. Really, it just made me more abrasive and brittle. I was sexually assaulted and molested as a child, as well as when I was a late teen. I've been in 3 horribly distressing relationship, all of which have ended in me being severely hurt in one way if another. I was cheated on in my first two, beat in the second, distanced and used in the third, and manipulated in all three. I attempted suicide in high school. I've had radical changes to my friend group here in college and the waves won't stop coming. I generally feel alone most of the time. Honestly, I'm not sure if I was born with anxiety and depression or if it developed over the course of my life.

Hell, I can't even really feel happy without that feeling coming back and tearing me down. That's why I'm writing this right now. I felt life was on an upswing, I was feeling better about my last breakup, about my mental state, about the progression I've made in taking care of myself and treating myself less like a garbage can and more like a person. Then, out of nowhere, those horrible negative feelings all flooded out and I broke down. I broke down really badly, too.

It has been my goal for 6 years to work as a mental health therapist, so failing out of school and accumulating debt was stressing me out more than anything else has before and I was feeling crushed by the weight. I have an additional 5k of CC and hospitalization debt.

 In early April I began having delusions that the police were surveiling me and about to arrest me, and I visited my bf during this episode. He talked to me for a few hrs but I was largely unresponsive, I did however tell him that I'd sent nudes to other people(we previously discussed this behavior and determined it was okay to do). He assumed this meant that I cheated on him but couldn't say it, so he began shouting at me, dumped me and kicked me out of his house, also humiliating me in the process(shouting about nudes so everyone could hear etc). He has 2 kids that I'm close to and being a part of his family was a core identity of mine, so I felt utterly demolished and devastated in addition to the paralyzing fear my delusions were bringing me. I drove home and spent 4 days laying on the couch barely sleeping. My delusions worsened to the point that I thought people were trying to kidnap and torture me, I experienced being sexually assaulted by demons and other horrors, and so my family hospitalized me. Medication brought me out of the psychosis. 

I saw a therapist for about 2 months but it didn't help much. She was encouraging me that I could continue my schooling, and she had some reservations about my bf's behavior. We ended up getting back together and he felt terrible about what happened, apologized several times and expessed the desire to better himself. I am still trying to determine if he is as understanding as I need in a person, and expecting him to work on this. 

Since all of this happened my confidence is at an all time low. I often feel like an incapable baby, and like it is impossible for me to finish my schooling or complete my goals. I often want someone to behave as my caretaker and shield me from all the terrible things in the world. I have interests in submission and BDSM and see that these areas are blending into my lack of confidence and esteem in ways that are maybe unhealthy. 

My partner has said it's okay for me to be a SAHM, and sometimes I feel such low confidence that it's tempting to give up on my career goals and depend on someone else. But I know that deep down, being a therapist is something I feel drawn to and that I want to accomplish for myself, whether or not I spend a few years as a SAHM that is *not* where I want my story to end. 

It's hard to build myself up when all I feel like is an ineffective, inexperienced, unintelligent, dependent, awkward baby afraid of new challenges. My partner's family is full of extroverts but I'm reserved and thoughtful, my quietness often makes it hard for people to get to know me and some people in his family feel weird about it. Anyway, how can I start to build myself up and accomplish my goals instead of giving in to my impulses to be dependent?",24Oct2019,1
65,"I've backslid a lot. I've realized I haven't made as much progress as I thought. It's like as soon as I take my eyes off my shadow, I fill it with more terrible habits. I feel like everyone I've worked with in the last 4 years thinks I'm a really fucking stupid crazy slut. I had a habit of sleeping with coworkers because all I've ever wanted is to feel like I'm cared about and it always ended with me crying obviously inappropriately at work or having mental breakdowns and I feel like I'm such a menace to society because of all of that that I don't deserve to exist or breathe. I feel like I just make the world worse. I lost my last job because I had a mental breakdown and left. I haven't worked in 3 weeks and the walls are closing in and it doesn't feel worth it. I finally see how fucking terribly inappropriate my behavior has been and I just want a steady job. I want to keep my head down and become financially stable. But the weight of my past and how I feel others must see me are making me feel like I deserve to kill myself. I have a few amazing friends keeping me on this planet, but they can't help all the time.

76,"
I need some help. I feel like I'm not myself and its scaring me. It started a few months ago when I came back from my bfs. I had an appointment at the dentist and was with my parents, I was sitting there looking at them in pure confusion asking myself ""are they my real parents?"" I was only away from them for 2wks.
The next incident was when I was looking at myself in the mirror, and i couldn't recognize who I was. I still have problems with looking at myself because it weird myself out, and no it's not because of self esteem 
Lately, I've been feeling like different people are in my mind and I talk to them. It's new and I don't know what to do about it. I didn't have that issue till my grandma passed away 2mths ago. 
I can't go to a therapist because I don't have the money to pay, i live with my parents and we have to worry about bills and food. I'm only 18 dealing with this. That's why I'm coming here to talk about it and get some idea of what's been going on. No one knows about this, not my parents, brother, or my boyfriend. I love them dearly but they won't understand.",24Oct2019,2

I live under the roof of abusive parents who use derogatory slurs as a means to demean me. 

I am a high school senior, and I just got into an argument with my parents about homework/work ethic/college apps. 

As per usual, my parents used derogatory slurs to insult me, and I've locked myself in my room and been silently crying until about 10 minutes ago. That's when my head cleared, and I returned to normal. However, I noticed something else came with the clearing of my head. I feel motivated to do work (its 12:17 am), even though I was super sleepy and was about to go to bed until the argument happened. Now, that sleepiness has vanished and instead I feel almost refreshed.

Initially, I was elated I could have access to care again.

I can’t find a provider who takes Medicaid. I’ve been turned away from every clinic I’ve called. Medicaid office stated they don’t have a list of providers and to just “call around”, online resources of providers are inaccurate, disconnected numbers, etc. I found 1 place but it’s now 6 weeks later and I’m still jumping through hoops to just schedule an appointment.

87,"Hi all,

Just for background, I’m a 19YF, attending university in a major that I absolutely love. I have a very loving and supportive boyfriend, and life is at a point where I should be happy, or at least content, with where I am. Or it is when you look at it from the outside. Obviously, people can’t read minds, and I know that a lot of my issues might be resolved if I just asked for help, but I’ve been going through a rough patch lately, and I’ve been thinking about some choices I’ve made in the past, concerning my past with seeing psychotherapists and other counsellors/therapists. 

I have this really vicious cycle, where I’ll realise that I need help with myself, and I’ll make the appointment and start talking to a new therapist, and then out of nowhere, for seemingly no reason, I’ll stop seeing them and I won’t even say why or give them a heads up. I know that this is extremely rude of me, and I feel such extreme guilt that I make myself sick by worrying about it so much, but I honestly don’t even know why I do it. I’ve been diagnosed with GAD, and was being treated for some pretty extreme traumatic events that just felt like they were happening to me nonstop. My last therapist was looking into treating me and diagnosing me with a complex post traumatic stress disorder, and had begun to ask me questions and discuss possible BPD in that mixture, but I stopped seeing him after a short while. 
My last therapist before him was actually putting me through a 12-week program designed for war veterans (I am not a war veteran) with PTSD symptoms. Once again, I stopped seeing him about four weeks into the program. 
My therapist before that tried to do some hypnosis stuff on me. Didn’t work, and I left after maybe three weeks after telling her that I’m “totally all good”. I definitely was not and would attempt suicide three times within the next year and a half. 
Before that, I was with a social worker, who didn’t really work well with me, and felt more like a really awkward soundboard that I never told the truth to. 

I’ve been with what feels like a lot of people for trauma related events. My brain will go through these cycles, where I start to have these memories of some of my really traumatic moments, and I start to isolate myself. However, I’m at the point where I am able to recognise that I do need help. The only problem is that for the last two therapists of mine, I’ve made the promise that I would go through with my treatment, but never did and only ended up staying for some weeks before completely abandoning them without any warnings. 

So, I’m here because of this vicious cycle that I go through whenever I do end up seeing somebody. I can’t find anything through Google about people going through cycles of seeing a therapist and then abandoning treatment like four weeks into it. 

Why do I go through these cycles? I feel like absolute crap every single time, yet I still do it. Why?

Any advice for how to stop doing this?

Any and all advice is appreciated?

Thanks.",24Oct2019,3
88,"A bit of background: I have a long time friend, my builder (Male 70ish) who was a long time smoker and eventually succumbed to lung cancer. He quit smoking and had treatment which was successful, some years later he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had treatment for that too, it has re-occurred and he has had followup treatment recently. The radiation treatment knocked him around a bit ( tumor affected the back of his brain to do with balance but hasn't affected his balance). The treatment has been finished a month ago and now he just doesn't want to get out of bed.  He spends all day in bed. I am worried he has just given up of life. 

I am thinking the issue is depression but he is a particularly stubborn character and I know from others that have tried to help him, he gets very cranky about this. Can anyone give me some starting points? He will get out of bed to see the GP but that is about it.",24Oct2019,1
89,"I have once tried both and neither experience went well. My therapist I had last year after finally breaking down and attempting was highly clinical and at times stand offish. And at some points felt vaguely insulted at her comments only after 3 visits which isn't like me either. She immediately tossed me to a psych who she promised to recieve me and their receptionist essentially derided me over the phone asking if they took new patients. 

When I did find a psych I never actually met her her but only the life coach which... I found out later a month in. After 3 months of never having met her and only having the lfie coach sign off on anti-depressants on month 3 it came time to contact them again for a visit and to plan a refill only to be repeatedly dodged and avoided. This forced me to go cold turkey on the medicine which almost had me enact a suicide plot. Found out shortly after they were being investigated with the DEA and I was just left to fend for myself. 


So after these two events last year I'm... Not sure which way to go. I have problems. Both therapist and psych wanted to see to further evaluations for PTSD, major bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder, and possibly high-functioning aspbergers. But I never got to see enough of either. 

To be truthful I... Still dont know what is expected of me from either. Each time I sat down at the therapist hopibg to find help I didn't really understand how they helped so it felt like I was supposed to present a case and defend why I should be paying to be there and have help. With the psych/lifecoach pair of which the one I was supposed to see but never saw on our appointments it was... Well the life coach did listen and he genuinely tried. In fact, the life coach is the only one who I really had any help from despite him unable to do much. 


I guess where I am at I am not sure what to do. I have issues in my head I need help with and my dips into this manic depressice and apathetic swings are getting larger and worse again. I want to start HRT and get started on a transition past but I know mental stability has to be a primary. My health insurance kicks in November 1st from my job and I can find someone on network but I still barely have money for anything. I'm still scared to be tossed and lost between the paperwork and become another undesirable patient. Even other doctors in the past I have always had horrid luck and experiences with to where I have people to vouche for how badly they treat me so commonly, so much so I have to bring someone along to any health visit to make sure I get treated approprietly. I know it is mostly bad luck on this regard but it is just so demoralizing.


I guess what I am saying is, despite my horrible luck I don't know which route to go first. I have so many things that need to be addressed but I dont know how. I dont know which to do first. And when I even get to one I am nervous and afraid of how it will go. It took years to try both once and another year for me to even consider again.",24Oct2019,1

92,"So my eating disorder relapsed, and for the past 6 weeks i’ve been eating about 200-600 calories a day, ultimately having a breakdown when I realised my scale was 5 lbs off and I lost only 20lbs instead of 25. My mother is similarly concerned over me, but never responds well when it gets revealed (Last time it relapsed, I got yelled at that i’m just faking anorexia and i’m being a joke towards the ones who actually have it and should be ashamed of it).

So I have to try to actually eat better for my own good. I'm 130-132 lbs at the moment, at 5'3 and 17F. But with my brain lacking self control my whole life, I'll either just become miserable binging and feeling disgusting or become miserable starving because all my emotions shut down and I see stars. So I need to try doing the following things:

- Develop better eating habits (That I'll deal with myself. I'll be doing intermittent fasting just because I made it a habit to only have coffee for breakfast and I'd like not to break it. Eating in the morning ruined my life)
- Learn not to hate myself at my current weight (Granted I still want to lose 5 lbs and be at 125, but then the hard bit it not letting it spiral and wanting to lose more. 125-130 lbs is ok for my height age and gender, right?)
- Learn not to want to die for having a normal hearty meal and eat 1000-1200 calories instead of only 200-600.

100,"I hope none of my friends see this cause this is going to be kind of cringy but it’s fineeee. A few years ago I was in a pretty bad place. None of what I’d been through is as bad as what any of my other friends have been through but as a stupid 11 year old (I’m 15 now) I took this experience as one of the worst things in the world and my mental health became quite bad to a point where I was contemplating suicide and self harm everyday for 3 years. I won’t get into the specifics but I held onto this trauma for 3 years and didnt tell a single person. Finally I talked to someone and learnt to let go of my problems and handle them better.  Now I can confidently say that I haven’t even thought of suicide for about a year and I’m doing so, so good. I know everyone’s heard this a million times but; no matter what your problem is or what you’re going through things will get better. I promise. It may take 3 years but it will get better. I love you all and I hope you’re all doing well :)",24Oct2019,1
101,"I suffer from depression and borderline personality disorder and also had a small undiagnosed period of substance abuse. 

I recently found an opportunity for me to be able to provide some sort of public service and get paid to do start up a project that can do that. I want to work with mental health because its seen as some sort of beast with stigma and taboos as its evil henchmen. But I want to help change that and I'm struggling to figure out how. 

Then I realized what better way to figure what to do other than ask the people who are familiar with it the most. 

So far after a few hours of brain storming I came up with a type of listening program. Educating on mental health can be very informative and helpful to those who want it but with a society filled with stigma that seems like a difficult task. 

What if I could create some sort of anonymous listening area. A place where you can come to rant without judgement but with anonymity - like reddit but a physical version. You can request advice or just have someone listen. You can request further help or resources in the community or not, etc. 

What do you guys think?",24Oct2019,6
102,"I'm a 19yo student and 5days ago I've developed sudden sensorineural hearing loss. On top of losing hearing in one ear, I've severe tinnitus along with it. I have a huge national exam coming up in less than 2weeks but I can't focus on anything because the constant loud ringing in my ear is driving me crazy. Even after consulting specialists, I'm told that there's nothing they could do and ""only time will tell"" if I'll ever recover. I've been crying myself to sleep every night and even breaking out into random tears during the day. I honestly have 0 hopes of recovery and feel like dying just to stop this neverending ringing in my head. At this rate I'm going to screw up my upcoming examinations and I don't know if I can handle being deaf and a failure. And that goddamn ringing that won't go away. I've nobody to confide in because I feel so guilty stressing out my closest friends with my problems. Everybody has enough on their plates, and I don't want to be an additional burden.

105,"I had a borderline eating disorder (definitely unhealthy eating habits m) back in college. I lost 15lbs instead of gaining the freshman 15. Everyone said I looked sick (I was small to begin with) and I thrived off of those comments. 

I broke down one night while standing in front of the mirror and decided I couldn’t do it anymore. I got help. The college therapy center made me get an entire physical, CBC, etc. I was deficient in potassium, magnesium, and had an irregular EKG. They wouldn’t sign off on letting me study abroad. It was a wake up call. 

It’s been almost 13 years. I was never “recovered” - every day recovery was a choice that I had to push myself to make. 

I have no idea what changed lately but I don’t have that will anymore. Last time at my OB/GYN, she was on to me. She said I had lost 10lbs and had ketones in my urine. She asked if I was intermittent fasting and told me I had no more weight to lose. She officially diagnosed me as “underweight” in my medical chart (even though I was still a few lbs away from technically being underweight). 

Anyway, I’m 10lbs less from when I saw her. I’m 8+lbs underweight on a very small frame. I do not deny I have a problem. But I can’t stop. It’s an addiction. I can’t even tell you a psychological trigger besides body dysmorphic disorder. It’s not about control. It’s not about a traumatic childhood event. It’s literally that I look in the mirror and see flab. To make matters worse, any weight I do but on goes straight to my face. It’s awful. I feel like I could hide extra weight around my midsection, but I can’t hide my cheeks. 

I (rather stupidly) always think that because millions of people in this world are starving not by choice, and they’re much more severely malnourished than I am, that I am fine. That’s why I was super confused with my physical results back in college, and I almost think they lied just to scare me. But then the other part of me is terrified I’ll have a heart attack. 

I’m a functional anorexic. No one has mentioned it except my MD. People just assume I’m a very thin person. I hold a very good job at the top of the ladder, I have two happy kids, a successful relationship. Even my SO hasn’t said anything, but he’s with me every single day, and I’m not sure he’d notice a 20lb weight loss over a year period. 

He knows about my prior issues. I’ve been very open about it. But for some reason I cannot bring myself to tell anyone this time around - I almost don’t want to be “fixed” 

I cannot go away to inpatient therapy. I cannot leave me job, my kids, etc. I feel like it would spiral out of control at that point. Even more so than it is. I know my life is more important, but going away is not an option for me. 

Has anyone found success for online programs? Particularly for someone who knows they have a problem but doesn’t exactly want to stop? I know I *need* to stop, but I’m not totally at the *want* part yet.",24Oct2019,1
106,"Hello everyone.

4 years ago I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I have been on medication that works very well for 8 months now. Nowadays I don't feel anxious anymore.

What keeps me wondering is that I tend to have a lot of ""Mood swings"". For exemple, I might wake up one day and feel energetic, somehow happier than usual and I tend to have moments where I laugh hysterically without reason. The laughter usually lasts for a minute or so and might come back soon after. I feel very energetic but don't necessarily feel the need to act on it. Thought it makes me feel like my thoughts are going very fast.

Other days, I might feel very pessimistic, a little bit gloomy even. I don't cry, like nearly ever, but I get in moods where I don't even care if I die (Though I don't want to or will not act on it). These days, I tend to feel like I am ""evil"" or that my thoughts don't make sense and that I'm on the verge of losing my mind. Like if I don't resist, I'll end up being like a villain in a super hero movie.

And finally, some days I might feel numb and have trouble caring about what's happening around me much.

These moods tend to alternate. In a day or 2-3 days, I'll be in the same mood and then it might change suddenly with a transitional phase in between. I feel like I don't really control myself and that if I don't make efforts to counter act on my thoughts, I'll end up doing some inappropriate things. But, these mood are not to the point of being extreme, like, I'm not saying I'm bipolar, you know? 

I don't know if all this in only ""in my head"" or not or if this is something to be diagnosed. My next meeting with my psychiatrist is in 2 months and I wanted to talk about it before then.

What do you think?

Anyway, for anyone taking the time to read everything and responding, thank you very much.",24Oct2019,1

108,"So I don't know if this can go here, but imma try it anyway. (TLDR at the bottom)

I really struggle with my mental health, and a huge thing that plays on my mind is that I'm not good enough for my friends to like me.
I am the only one in my group who has to work to stay afloat at uni (the rest getting financial support from their families) and as such I usually have about £20 a week spare after my bills and such.
Every time an issue at the house arises they suggest paying for it to be sorted (e.g. doing a deep clean of the kitchen, or getting a gardener to trim the hedge). Each time this happens I ask why we can't work together to fix it and mention I can't afford to get someone in to do it.
I usually get a big backlash from them saying that I don't need to make everything 'so deep' all the time but I just wish they'd understand I can't afford some of the same stuff as them and I wish I didn't have to feel so pressured into spending when I don't have the money... It's making me so anxious and I don't know how to deal with it anymore.

TLDR: how do i get my friends to understand and accept that I don't have as much money to throw at things as they do without feeling like they hate me?",24Oct2019,2

114,"Some context: My wife and I are both South African Born. My Mother in law is a British citizen. All of her kids automatically qualify for Citizenship as a result. I have a son (11 going 12 next year June) from a previous relationship. We have always played with the idea of immigrating to the UK, but put it off as my son was too young and I wasn't ready to leave him behind. We have sold our home and all of our stuff and will be heading over mid 2020.

So here's what I am struggling with: 
Obviously there's a ton of emotions associated with emigrating. I feel so elated and excited one day, because of this wonderful adventure we are embarking on and the next I feel completely overwhelmed by the idea. I have never been outside of SA apart from a trip to Namibia as a kid, my wife on the other hand has been all over the world and is very well traveled. (She's been a superstar through this entire process BTW. Truly the best person and partner ever.) 

One of the biggest challenges for me is the fact that my son from a previous relationship has chosen to stay with his mom. And I get that and respect that, but it still breaks my heart that I will not be seeing him as often as we do now. There's been a lot of crying and reassurance and some more crying and we've been going to therapy together for several months now, to help us cope with the massive change and it's been really helpful. But I am also really sad because he will see his little brother (3) and us only twice a year once we move. (we are getting him a long term travel Visa so he can come and go for the next 10 years without issues)
 
It's such a roller coaster of emotions because I am leaving my comfort zone because this country, however broken it may be, was the only place I have ever called home. I am leaving my family behind, I am leaving my culture behind and at times that really feels overwhelming. For all of it's faults SA is where my heart is and always will be. Our therapist has given me methods to cope with all of this, but the fear still manages to creep up on me and get the dark side of my mind going. Things like I won't find a good job. You're going to fail and come back with nothing, you're too useless to make it over there etc. etc. 

I've also been doing a lot of introspection and I have been trying to improve myself as a kind of coping mechanism, but I still feel at times that I am not going to succeed. Any tips on how to work through these emotions would be welcome and thank you for taking the time to read this.",24Oct2019,1
115,"I'm just burnt out; I've been throwing up almost every day for the last month and a bit, at first thinking it was gastritis, continued throwing up, thought it was constipation, continued throwing up, and after having a colonoscopy, and an endoscopy, found out that my stomach ""door"", to the intestines is out of alignment, to the right, and my intestines are a bit twisted. I've been ordered not to eat or drink orally, because everything just stays in my stomach isn't going through the ""door"".

116,"I'm just so exhausted. I don't even know what from exactly, but I can't think clearly at all. 

I guess it's my whole life situation that exhausts me. I'm studying 1.5 hours away from home so I'm in public transport for like 3 hours per day. I couldn't move closer even if I wanted to. But that definitely takes its toll on my energy. Next is that I'm studying something that I'm not confident about so I can't motivate myself to do it, and I need serious dedication if I want to see this through. Then there's also the fact that I feel really down quite often. It killed all of my self-esteem, and there wasn't much to start with. I don't have the energy to get over it and socialize more, which in turn makes me worry more and that takes more energy. The constant overthinking about being in a place in life that I genuinely don't feel good about and the loneliness that I feel have also got to be major contributors.

The fact that I lose three hours of my day in public transport is bad enough but it also means that I need to wake up way earlier so I can never keep a regular sleeping schedule. I do get at least 6 hours every night and it's usually even more but I notice that even if I get 9 or 10 hours I'm still exhausted that day.

I'm not sure what to do with this. I'm not in any state to work on my current project but I don't want to leave my teammates behind.

Within the last 3 months both my GP and psychiatrist quit. They wrote me prescriptions for a year until I find their replacements.

It’s very daunting to tell my story to people, even medical professionals, so I’ve been dragging my feet finding new doctors. I also live in an area with exceptionally high rates of mental illness and substance abuse issues. It’s actually quite hard to find a doctor who doesn’t assume I’m either looking for controlled drugs, or looking to start the suboxone program. 

My mother has offered to pay for therapy for me out of the area, (I have state-provided coverage currently) and I would happily drive a few hours a week to a therapist if they’ll help me get out of this hole.

I’ve done talk therapy and CBT, both actually worked well and I completed the treatments / the therapists “let me go” because my depression seemed relieved.

Instead of going to the doctor at the time I chose to drink each night to ensure I slept. I did that 7 days a week for the next 10 years. After stopping that pattern in May, sleep was generally much improved and restful till I started a more intense regimen of therapy. 

I used to go bi-weekly to a psychotherapist but since added on a weekly specialized therapy group for alcohol use + seeing a psych doctor in conjunction. I also read a lot more about this subject matter and try to practice as much as possible to ""relearn"" healthier ways of thinking and doing. 

The combination of all of this has left me with what seems to be almost a perpetual state of ""emotional hangover."" Since this intense schedule began I've noticed my sleep to be completely bonkers.

I went from an average of 7 hrs with not much time getting to sleep with maybe 1-2 wake ups to experiencing 5+ wake ups a night, being awake for hours and some nights not sleeping at all.

I try to have good sleep hygiene aka: turn off screens an hour before bed, read, listen to calming podcasts etc and nothing seems to really help. Often I'll wake up at like 2-3am and feel wide awake so rather than toss and turn I just get up and ride out the day but I know that's NOT healthy, but I'm not getting anywhere further with this easing either so not sure what to do about it.

She explained to me the things I'm feeling why I am feeling those things like anxiety and anger, and she said that I need therapy, and she diagnose me with ""Bipolar"" and she said that all of that OCD and social anxiety I have, it's my brain's coping mechanism which is kinda doubt if that's true but she studied psychology for like 5 years so okay. She prescribe me with aripriprazole and it's a anti psychotic drug I guess it helps bipolar people. 
And I take it, after a day, I've experience the worse side effects, my sight just turned completley black I though I am staring to be blind, and then I get really bad headaches and started feeling nausea and dizzy and sleepy. I just want to be in bed.
I regain my eyesight quickly but I am afraid of what can happen so I stop taking it and I will gonna contact her about the side effects tomorrow morning. What should I go to another psychiatrist or stick with her or what? Thank you.",24Oct2019,2
130,"Hello, folks,
I wanted to briefly introduce myself and my psyche. At the age of 13 I didn't have many friends and so I imagined a lot about my intellect to protect myself. Since then I have made many new friends and am very happy at the moment. Recently, however, I have noticed some strange things about myself. So I often have fantasies of omnipotence and generally a slight tendency to feel very comfortable in positions of power.
 On a rational level I understand that I am not a special person, but my emotional part does not want to accept that. I can do some things well and I can do some things badly. More often, however, I overestimate my ability excessively while almost completely ignoring my mistakes. I have already thought about whether I might suffer from delusions of grandeur.
I also notice some basic features of paranoia in me, because I often feel like I'm being followed even though I am not.",24Oct2019,6

Some days it’s really, really bad and other days I live completely anxiety free which is why I’m so on the fence about trying medication as a solution. I see a therapist once a week but I’m not sure that’s doing much for me. I just want anxiety to stop controlling my life.

137,"I had suspected that something was wrong with me. Since I was young, I would have fits of uncontrollable anger (the migraine-inducing, screaming-at-the-top-of-your-lungs, breaking-everything-you-see kind of anger) that I would hide from my parents by locking myself in my room, turning on some loud music, throwing pillows at walls, screaming into them, and then keysmashing swear words on social media.

I put that down simply as adolescent rage. When I got to college until now that I got a job, I didn't think much of it because aside from being SUPER DUPER ANGRY AND MEAN when I got stressed or hurt, I was a completely nice, kind, and functional human being.

Last night, my coworker reacted (probably accidentally) with a thumbs down in one of the messages that I sent to our work group chat. Lacking sleep and having suspected for the longest time that she's been hating on me for no reason, I. JUST. GOT. SO. MAD. Like any 21-year-old in 2019, I took to social media for my grievances. I tweeted a lot of MEAN SHIT to my coworker, bashed her professional career, called her a bitch a couple thousand times and then hoped for her death. A LOT of people liked those posts, and I loved it. Seeking more likes, I got emboldened to post more mean things about her until I eventually got enough likes to reach her.

If I were me, like normal, rational-thinking me, I wouldn't have sent those tweets at all. But I was angry me, I was this other version of me that thought I was always right, better than everyone else, and indestructible. When I am this version of me, I do whatever the fuck I want and say whatever the fuck I want because I don't think there are consequences to my actions. See, not that I *didn't think* about the consequences but that even if I did think about the consequences, I would still feel like it were nonexistent or weren't so bad.

Well, the consequences, in hindsight, are now SUPER REAL. Everyone in the office hates me and I think I'm gonna lose my job soon. I know, rationally, that I deserve this, but I don't seem to feel any real remorse for what I did. I can prompt myself to feel remorse and guilt when I rationally think about the consequences of my actions to those aggrieved, but I think that deep down I still think it's not my fault, like evil me is not just dormant me but the innermost me, and it's not letting me feel any *real* remorse, only enough to manipulate everyone around me that I do feel remorseful. I still think that none of this is my fault, even though it's stark obvious that it really is.

I also still don't seem to care about the consequences, but just want this whole ordeal to be over, regardless of the results. I don't seem to care about losing my job, even though I like my job; I just want to get punished or fired so that it's over and I can move on with my life.

What's wrong with me?",24Oct2019,3

My specific criteria is DC Metro area, treats depression, and accepts medicare. It's a bit more than that but I wasn't expecting a recommendation, although that would be cool.

I attempted to find one of my old docs, and was willing to pay cash, since I haven't had very good experiences with medicare...and they have unfortunately moved and changed career pursuits...so I am pretty disappointed and at a bit of a loss as that was my plan if all else fails.",24Oct2019,1

144,"Growing up, I've had a host of baggage, and I think one of the biggest obstacles I've had with gaining excitement in life is  letting what other people think completely kill my buzz, and because of that It's hard to find anything really fun at times.

A good example of this is my recent expensive purchase of an HTC vive (a virtual reality headset). I didn't 100% enjoy VR immediately, but the more I used it, the more it grew on me, and I ended up having a really fun time. Then when I went to VRchat and talked to the people on there about how cool everything was, all it took was one persons incredibly unenthusiastic ""yeah it's okay"" to completely ruin it for me. All of a sudden this caught me off guard. I was having a really awesome time, while this person didn't seem to care too much about it.

 My mind tried to process why this person didn't seem to like something on the same level as I did. Was I overreacting to my experience? Was something wrong with me? I couldn't even get the chance to ask him more, so instead my mind jumped to extreme conclusions that this guy really didn't like VR, and I probably shouldn't like it either for all the reasons that popped up in my mind of why I shouldn't like VR, like how all the stuff there isn't real. I realize how rediculous and at least partially crazy this sounds. Logically I know this guy was probably distracted, and he doesn't represent everyones oppinion, hell he seemed to have some like of it despite hinting in his voice that it wasn't THAT interesting (I also have a terrible habit of reading peoples tone and mood, I get it wrong 50% of the time), but for some reason just that guys opinion has killed 70% of my enthusiasm.

Tell me, is there anyway I can get this enthusiasm back? Is there any way to form new interests that aren't fragile. Is there any way I can just enjoy something on my own without feeling my opinions are at least sometimes inferior to others? Sometimes I can pull it off, other times it's strangely hard.

147,"One of my first posts so I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense at all, to be honest it barely makes much sense to me in my head but I'll try my best to explain.

I am a nearly 20 year old female, struggling with my head for roughly 11 years (earliest I can remember consistent feelings like this)  I go to work for 3 hours a day then spend the other 21 at home in bed, i have recently cut 80% of people out of my life because they were no good for me in one way or another, this though has left me with some family and 2 friends of which I don't see or rarely speak to (tbh I'd of liked to of cut them off too but I know one of them needs me rn) with no hobbies or interests and nothing I'm particularly good at, I spend my 21 hours sitting in silence switching between games on my phone and sleeping whenever I can. Quite frankly I fucking hate being awake and despise the fact that I have to be alive even more so. The only thing I've ever found to distract my head and the thoughts in it are to exercise, which I did for 6 months straight at a gym and I was probably in the best space mentally during this time than I have been in my whole life. Problem is I can't get to that gym anymore and since it was a discount gym, it was the only one I (a broke bitch) could really afford, the only one I can get to now (it's a road away ffs) is £50 a month which for someone on as little pay and as little hours as me, can't afford. So since I can't get to the gym and there are no local outdoor parks with equipment or such in, I am losing all motivation for life completely and I've never felt so fed up with having to be alive.

149,"Hey Reddit,

I don't ever share anything on here, but I've taken a lot away from reading posts in this community. This morning I woke up and felt really inspired to share a post and an article I wrote that I shared with people in my life a couple of weeks ago on the 6 month anniversary of my dad's dead. You've all given me so much with your sharing, and I wanted to give something back.

\--

I don’t ask people for much in life, but if you’re scrolling past the post on your feed today, it’d mean the world to me if you’d take the time to read it. If there are people in your life who you feel would take something away from reading this as well, then please share it with them too.

It's been nearly 7 months since my dad took his own life.

After his death most of my days were consumed by either keeping myself incredibly busy, or isolating myself in attempt to figure out how to cope with losing someone I thought I’d have so much more time with. About a month ago when I started writing this article about my dad and his depression, I began to see what it was that I needed to do in order to move on with my life without feeling like I was forgetting about him.

When he died, it gave me the opportunity to reflect on the years I had spent with him in my life, and I was overwhelmed with emotion. There was so much love I felt I had never actually given him, and now that I couldn’t, I felt stuck. The more I wrote, the more I discovered that all of that pent up love did actually have somewhere to go - into what it is that I’m passionate about in life.

After 26 years of being alive, I feel like I’ve finally started to live my life. I’m happier and more fulfilled right now than I ever have been. I know how backwards that may sound to some of you, especially with everything I’ve been through this year, but it’s true. That doesn’t mean I don’t still cry, or get upset over the loss of my dad; it just means that when I’ve finished crying, I pick myself back up and keep moving forward.

Over the past few months, a lot of people have told me how sorry they are that he’s gone, and to let them know if I need anything. I never knew how to respond to this because I didn’t know what I needed, the same way none of them did. Today, I know what I need. I don’t need anyone to be sorry for my loss, I need people to believe in me and support me with what I’m now going to take on next in my life as a result of losing him.

In life, loss is something that’s going to happen. We don’t ever get a say in when we’re going to lose someone, and the more we resist it, the harder it pushes back. What we do have control over is what we do with that loss. Losing my dad can be a tragedy and a weight I carry with me for the rest of my life, or it can be a gift. For me, he’s given me a perspective on life most people don’t get to have at 26 years old, and for that I am forever grateful.

Cheers Dad.

You’re one hell of a man, and I know that you’re right beside me ready to take on the next 26 years.

151,"Things are Less Than Okay right now. For the past week, seemingly out of nowhere, I woke up feeling so desperately low it's like there's an invisible bruise forcing my chest to concave - this awful, physically draining sadness. I don't have the energy or motivation to do anything but go through the motions of my life. I cry at a moment's notice and can't explain why. Frequently I get stuck in loops where I fantasise about self harm and suicide, though I have no intention of doing either. My eyes feel so heavy and it's like my whole spirit is draining away. Any small irritations that I could usually brush off are a hundred times worse, and I keep getting bad memories (childhood sexual abuse and some issues with my parents' mental health) replaying constantly in my mind.


This isn't the first time this has happened - I've had these periods of sudden, overwhelming misery before; sometimes triggered by stress but sometimes I cannot find any cause. They just seem to go away in time. Is this something I need to seek professional help about? How would they even begin dealing with something like this?


I saw a counsellor for suspected social anxiety as a teenager, but I could only get 10 sessions (gotta love wait times) and the experience was mostly negative anyway. So my expectations are low, and the thought of talking about this properly terrifies me to no end.

I just wanted to make this post because I don't really know how to get myself out of this.

I'm 16 y/o and I always struggled with finding friends or being social. I'm lonely and don't have anyone to talk to really so I usually overcome this loneliness by just eating random stuff that I can find in the kitchen . I don't have 1 actual friend but recently there is this girl that fell in love with me, we met in an art class, and i fell in love with her as well.

My issue is that I became so f-ing attached to this girl because she gives me all the love i never was given and when I'm around her I feel like everything its fine. When I'm not around her though, I just feel even more miserable than before I got to know her. It's like an actual drug for me right now. I read a bunch of reddit posts that say ""just go to the gym or join a sports team"" but everyone just makes it seem so easy to get this fixed. Is there something i can do mentally to at least somewhat overcome this issue ?

162,"My fiancé and I have been together for a couple of years and live together. About 3 months ago his handicapped father moved to where we live and we take care of him full time. It’s been a lot of pressure on him as he needs care everyday and we do not have any other help. His dad was with his sister who now lives 3 hours away. 

Lately it’s really been getting to him and the toll of his family dynamics I think are starting weigh on him. I don’t think he feels respected/appreciated by his mom and his sisters and it’s making him question his self worth. He feels like he is in it alone with his dad for the rest of his life. He’s been saying lately that he feels like he can’t do anything right, he just shouldn’t be around, he doesn’t have any free time anyways. He is saying things like this everyday at this point. He’s even talking about selling the things he loves because he doesn’t have time for hobbies anymore. It’s not been a successful adjustment. 

He just called me in tears because he talked to his sister about thanksgiving plans. She basically told him she wasn’t interested in being with their dad on thanksgiving because she wanted some alone time with her husband because of all her stresses lately. He was supposed to go with them to visit since he’s been with us and we were going to go to my hometown. They got in an argument on the phone and it ended up with her going off on him saying he was a condescending asshole etc when he wasn’t, she’s just extremely sensitive. I calmed him down and said we were going to figure it out and take a deep breath. He kept saying what a piece of shit he is that it’s just going to be him and his dad for the rest of his life. 

At this point I know he needs to see someone to work through dealing with his emotions surrounding his fathers stroke and his mother’s/sister’s treatment of him. I need some advice on how to approach the conversation with him. It’s making my anxiety go through the roof I’m worried sick. I’m considering calling his sister and telling her privately what’s going on so someone in his family is aware and can maybe step up and provide some more support on their fathers end so we can figure this out. I don’t feel as though I should continue to keep this to myself. I know she cares somewhere deep down inside but typically can’t get past her own stuff to feel empathetic for others. I’m hoping that maybe if she knows how he’s struggling like this she will help take the pressure off....maybe. Any advice is helpful.",24Oct2019,1

164,"In the last month I’ve had 3 or 4 huge, stressful issues pop up for me. I thought if I just “handle them”, I could eliminate the stress. However it has been 3 weeks since I “handled” them and none have been resolved. I feel frozen. Today I took a 40 minute train to uni, got off, and immediately got on a train back home because I couldn’t see myself sitting through 4 hours of lectures.

I need to take my landlord to court, but only one solicitor replied and it has been weeks of them “reviewing” my documents. Reached out to my estranged dad and offended him, so he’s stopped communicating with me again. My work from home business is so slow I’ve had to take on nannying, but I’m not sure this is a long term solution and I’m scared. Relationship is in limbo and we aren’t speaking.

I have a lot of things I need to do in order to survive this period. I need to sell some belongings. I need to be working more hours. I need to be reaching out to the solicitor. But I feel spaced out, stressed out, anxious, and just want to hide in bed. I am normally MOTIVATED by urgency and love to push myself but I feel myself mentally digging my heels into the ground.

They're unfortunately not uncommon with me. But this time I saw my phone charger move in a way that is physically impossible, it hovered and phased through solid metal bars several times like a glitch in a video game.

I spent the rest of the night panicking even more, and I just don't feel like I can even trust my senses anymore. I've felt since my early teens like my brain was completely separate and dumped whatever distressing thoughts it wanted into my head, but I have never had it just outright mess with me like this before. Now I'm panicking even more and really don't want to even try to sleep, because that's when I start spiraling. I just don't know what the hell to do, my family is going through too much for me to add to it like this, but I am genuinely terrified.

167,"This is going to be long so bare with me. Freshman year of highschool I met a boy. Now I say met, but really he was just performing in a play at school where I told him I liked his performance and I ran away. Let's call him L. L was very timid. He kept to himself and I asked around if anyone had heard of him but they all said they had classes with him but he mostly did his work and never talked to anyone. It seemed to lead to nowhere. I watched him from afar for months. Then the second semester started. I walked into my second block crossing my fingers. Just as I lost hope, he walked through the door and stood a few yards away from me. I was trembling and sweating profusely. This boy I had built up the biggest crush on, had been closer to me than ever and I waited to be given an assigned seat that was all the way across the room from him. Days passes, weeks passed, a month passes. I grow this part of my brain that was solely for him. I thought about him day and night. My dreams always were about him. I came to school and always stalked him everywhere he went. I wrote about him. I wrote ""to him"" in a journal to rant. I drew him in class I wrote about him as I stared at him. He mostly stayed in the library and it was easy to look at him in there without being noticed. L was perfection. He is perfection. He is the smartest person I've ever known and he's always been as quiet as people make him . out to be. A seat change in the second month, changed our situation. I looked at him very intently and he noticed. He heard me talking to myself about him. We were assigned a project that required a partner. I knew no one in that class and he didn't either. I shyly asked if he could be mine and he said yes. We shared earbuds once to listen to the song we chose and we touched hands once I swear my heart stopped. I was blushing so hard i was twitching in my seat, having to lean over close to him to be able to use the earbud. The project ended. I lost all hope in ever talking to him again. But things got worse. A few days before the last day of school I found his instagram and I messaged him. It was very simple just a hello and i lied, saying i just liked his account and that i was looking for friends. He believed it. We spoke very seldom and then, seeing him as he texted me back sent my brain into a spiral. My heart pounded. I started to type. All my words came out like puke. I told him very concerning things such as i knew where he lived and i so badly wanted to f\*\*k him and do terrible things to him. He still had no idea it was me, but I told him. I needed him to know that i needed him . He made a mistake in forgiving me because we kept talking after this. We talked a lot and it made me make plans. I wrote out a note. I texted him asking him to meet me in the stairwell on the first day of school or i would kill him then ra\*\* him and before Anything happened the police got involved. I broke down and i did get in trouble but no one understood. I don't wanna kill him cause he doesn't like me i just feel like he can't live. I want him. I'm homeschooled now but i still think of him. I keep the pictures i have of him and i still write to him. i really don't know what's the matter with me? I love him with all my heart i would do anything for him. literally anything.",24Oct2019,1

174,"I'm 27 male and pretty fucked up mentally. Never been diagnosed with a personality disorder, but I overthink, have trust issues, anxiety, insecurities, and my life is heavy. I've taken the MMPI-2 and MCMI-III testing, and was never diagnosed with anything.

I've been in a therapy for a few years, and I've improved but I still have a lot of these issues. My therapist thinks (and I agree) that my issues were rooted in my abusive upbringing (emotionally abusive parents). I've had 1 long term relationship (2.5 years), which was absolutely toxic, and I now share a 4 year old child with that ex. Fortunately, we are at peace coparenting and we have an amazing kid.

If I had a healthy upbringing, I don't think I would have engaged in that relationship. I've been separated from that ex for almost 3 years now. I thought my mental health issues were resolved, until recently, when I met a wonderful woman, and now I find myself overthinking, anxious, insecure, and my life is heavy. I may have already ruined what could have been a great relationship with her.

I'm sick of living this way, and I want to change for myself, and for those around me. What else can I do besides therapy?

I find myself to process things better when I read rather than listen, so any suggestions for books would be welcomed.

I have also tried taking SSRIs (lexapro) in late 2016, but I honestly can't recall if it helped. I just a got a new prescription for it, and I want to see if it helps, but I don't have much faith in mental health medication.

I'm also a PhD student, and I think typically educated people are more inclined to overthink?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These are words that my current girl has used to describe me:

(1) Walking on egg shells

(2) Overthinking

(3) Cornering her into her words

(4) Trapping her

(5) Taking things to the extreme

(6) Overreacting, get mad easily

(7) Making things heavy

There's more I can't think of them right now, but it's basically all intertwined",24Oct2019,2
175,"**I am writing this to get your opinions on the sort of mindset I experience, so that I can know if I'm overreacting and just feel sad sometimes, or my mind's playing tricks on me, from your experiences, knowledge or opinion. I like direct answers which is why I will be direct myself.**

Quick info: I am a male and I am beginning Uni.

It comes in waves. I've actually noticed them getting more frequent recently, and one of them can be set off easily by irritation or any negative thoughts. It'll last for a few hours, never a day, but will happen atleast every day or two.

I lose the will to get up and do something if I can avoid it. If I was texting someone I feel obsolete and unimportant - I don't want to say anything. Anything time I would go to say something I stop and it just makes me feel worse that I can't bring myself to speak to my friends. 

The same obsolete, lonely feeling would be the same in person too. Going quiet, letting others talk amongst themselves  (""I don't have anything important to add, others can do that much better than me. I don't really matter when there are other people who are so much more engaging."" I actually feel guilty for saying this. I feel like I'm looking for attention, and I always convince myself I am after I write it. I don't what's really me and which is this thing that I'm trying to figure out.)

I'll feel numb. No emotion surfaces inside. Maybe I'll want to cry when I get frustrated that I can't communicate but I just can't cry properly. I can't feel content or happy, or truly laugh - no matter what's being said.

It's like a heavy cloud hangs over your head, and the shadow is the only thing you can see.

With every failure to get out of it, every time something is suppressed by those feelings, I feel even worse. I'll lie slumped and defeated, a dead weight. Not curled up, just lying comfortably, and no face shoved in a nook - it's not like that. 


If the feeling was a physical action imagine a face getting more and more furrowed with a frown - except the frown is a poker face, a sad poker face. 


The worst of this only happens when I'm alone, the milder, quiet-inducing can happen in person.

I'm just fed up of this happening and every time thinking ""maybe it won't happen for a while"" but that's a lie. I'm typing this because I know it'll happen once again; I'll feel disconnected and separate from everyone I know; ""I'm not there for their company, I'm there because I've always been there, and I'm not taking up enough space to have to get rid of.""

Now, I love my friends. I care for them and support them, but these feelings are so powerful and they make me think they don't reciprocate my feelings towards them. I'm worried it'll twist me into someone of resent. 

It's not that I don't have the courage to speak up. I actually can't articulate it well enough in the moment. It took me ages to get to here with the right image constructed above to show myself. In addition to that, I don't feel like it's not important enough to bring up to bring up to the people I trust most. The guilt and doubt is persuasive. 

I have a friend who has me on Reddit. I hope, atleast I do right now, that she can read this, because then I'll have told her indirectly using all the time necessary to write it and this time I'm not stopping halfway through.



I would probably say I'm fine or I'm okay but please speak to me and persist. I'm trying to find out how to help myself, but I really need help because I can only help myself so much. Don't be put off by long ago this was or even if it was mentioned before.",24Oct2019,1

The ones where we were more intimate really make my stomach turn. I just had one outside and I ended up throwing up.

178,"On Tuesday night I was done with everything, my life has always been a series of unfortunate events. And Tuesday was no different, expect for the fact that it felt like god and everyone was laughing at me.

Unfortunately neither my boyfriend or roommates did much to de-escalate anything and only furthered questioned my own sanity, tried to guilt me into saying I didn’t want to kill myself anymore.my roommates were screaming and crying and getting physical with me making everything 10x worse. 
They THINK they witnessed me try to kill myself bu throwing myself out of a window but I threw my keys out of window and was trying to go down feet first to literally just get out of my apartment. You cannot corner and barracade someone that’s having a psychotic episode and in fight or flight mode. 

The police were called, I was taken in emergency custody to a crisis and assessment center. Released because of the fact that I have diagnosed panic disorder, severe anxiety + severe depression, I have health care physicians in place, and I was no long posing a threat to myself or anyone else, and let go because they determined I did not need to be hospitalized at the time.

I call my boyfriend to pick me up and take me home. I find out he’s in the ER, he broke his hand punching a door after I had been taken away. And he let me know that I could not return my own apartment because my roommates told him if I come back they are calling the police because they are not comfortable being around me or having me in the house. 

I finally get to my boyfriends apartment at like 2am. His only question was not “are you okay? Did they give you meds? What happened???” 

I got “why did they let you go??” Basically implying “how did you lie your way out of hospitalization” because again they all think they witness me try to kill myself. 

I finally get the point across to my boyfriend that no one did anything helpful in the situation besides call the police. I got the point across to him that no one had thought and me, why I was feeling that way and saying that I wanted to kill my self, that they only cared about how they were going to feel if I had killed myself. And how they felt about my mental state. 

I have taken all of my necessary belongings out of my apartment for the time being. 1/3 of my roommates is still being a pain. She told my boyfriend that I was selfish for this. The only thing that she has said is “you’re not gonna kill yourself in this apartment” and “I don’t want to wake up to find a dead body in my apartment”.

They let me know that “they’re comfortable with me being there” after I had taken all my stuff out. But ... I’m not comfortable around them. They made things 10x worse and pushed me beyond my breaking point. They screamed, got physical with me, had me taken away, and then threatened to have me arrested for coming home to my own apartment? And I’m supposed to say “thank god, let me just come back home to them”. 

We were all very close before this happened. 

I don’t know what to do. 2/3 have since calmed down and tried to be more helpful about everything but one of them is not.

192,"How do I just start a conversation with someone about mental health? How do I explain in a way that they can understand, that I just don’t feel like me? All this, and without being judged. I can’t seem to order or organise my thoughts into a logical order to begin to explain.

Firstly, I get so angry very easily - SO angry. The main thing that worries me is I have a two year old... I think most of you have probably heard of the terrible twos. I find myself suddenly shouting or even screaming horrible things, ‘just GO AWAY you are HORRIBLE’ when she’s being naughty, and physically pushing her away. She pulled my hair the other day playfully and I snapped and pulled hers back. I want to hit her when she’s been naughty - I actually had to slap myself round the face the other day to prevent me from hitting her. Then, as quick as I’ve got angry, I turn to floods of tears overwhelmed by guilt that I’ve just felt such anger and shouted at the one thing I love more than anything else in the world; that I’d do anything to protect. I work in the police in safeguarding - I know all too well the emotional damage it does to children to witness things like that. I know this isn’t me and I don’t want that for my baby girl.
When I see anything where children are hurt, or upset, or not cared for properly, it upsets me to the point of hysterical tears. I was in town shopping the other day and saw this unkempt mother, smoking a cigarette, looking like trash. She had this little girl in a push chair who was coughing away just being completely ignored and it just really got to me thinking this toddler deserved so much more, and before I knew it, I was in tears again about it. I just seem to be overly affected by things with children recently.

Sometimes, I’ll be driving along or just sat on the sofa and just suddenly be consumed by a sadness that’s come out of nowhere, and the tears will start rolling down my cheeks. I can’t even tell you what I’m crying at most the time, and other times it’ll be because my mind has gone into overdrive and I’ll suddenly think what it would be like to not have my daughter or my husband in my life. My imagination goes out of control &amp; I end up thinking what would happen if they died or something bizarre.

I have panic attacks where I’ve gone from 0-100 in seconds thinking about things which will probably never happen. I’ll look at my bank account and pay my bills which are always paid on time, but it doesn’t stop me from going through all kinds of scenarios in my head until my house has been repossessed and I’m living on the streets with my family. I panic and I can’t breathe, I’m shaking and crying struggling for air until I can eventually calm myself and realise I’m being completely irrational.

Also, I have no idea if it’s related but my memory is awful as well recently. It’s like I’m living on autopilot or in another body and I just don’t remember what I’m doing. I also get dizzy a lot.
I’m getting worse every day but I don’t even know where to start to get help; GPs just seem to look at you blankly then chuck some tablets at you to go away. I’m also petrified they’re going to refer to social services... petrified of them thinking I’m a bad mother &amp; petrified that the people I work with will find out and judge me. I just don’t know.

194,"For about a month or two I experience a lot more of hallucinations than before and I thought you guys could help me figure out why I do hallucinate. 


First of all, I get these more often when I haven't slept enough but one hallucination in particular apperas every day


Every time my cell phone alarm wakes me up I start to hallucinate for about 10min.-1 h. Instead of the alarm sound, I hear some news reporters talking and telling stories. Every normal sound gets mute and replaced with imaginary dialogue or music. I also don't see the things different things. For example, my cell phone is three times bigger and has melting word on the display. I sense all the things that are NOT real.(This happend every day)


 Eventho I am fully concious and think ""ugh why am I still hearing those voices and seeing those people??"" I can't stop those for about 10-30 minutes 


So and often times during say(mostly when I haven't slept enough) I see and hear a bunch of crazy stuff. Those replace the real stuff. For example, during school I saw eggs insted of folders. Thos lasted for maybe a minute before I realized that it's just a hallucination.",24Oct2019,1

On day 1, I feel super sad/anxious/depressed and feel like giving up on myself.

On day 2. I feel super pumped and feel very confident and tell myself problems are temporary and you can fix it. And I pretty much fixed many problems like that. 

But the thing is, quite recently it’s getting really bad and becoming really stressful and I can’t sleep till 4-5 in the morning and I have to leave for work around 10 which for a 12 hours shift everyday. 

Any one of you, if you ever wore my shoes please glorify me with your tips for coping up with myself.

Little insight about me,
1. I live alone.
2. My parents don’t know that I’m super broke, where sometimes my lunch money depends on the tips of the day before.
3. Works 70-80 hours a week. 
4.zero romantic life or 0 experience and denied few(ironically). With a regular oneitis.
5. Zero sports
6. Daily exercise 
7. Gave up smoking and not an alcoholic.
8.
 I’m really okay with facing problems and fixing  them up, I have no complaints about them(even though a new one knocks the door everyday).
I accept my life for being like that.

200,"So back story first I guess.

In 2012, I had a pretty big psychotic break. I got a kinda-sorta treatment and went about my way. For anonymity sake, we'll say I was between 18-23. It might have been happening before then, but I can't remember. I have pretty bad memory. After seeing how people treated me after hearing about it, I told everyone it had stopped even though my hallucinations, delusions, depression, and paranoia never went away.

I totally withdrew from society for 3 years while I taught myself how to deal with everything. At the end of this period was when I got together with my wife. She had heard about the 2012 incident and I told her the same lie I told everyone else. I was fine.

Flash to today. My symptoms seem to be getting worse, and I'm starting to have a hard time distinguishing reality from time to time. It's to the point that I know my downward spiral is starting to effect my wife. I'm fine withdrawing again. I'm indifferent to it. However, it hurts me to know that I'm struggling to make my wife happy like I used to. I would do anything to make her happy again. So I went to my local clinic a few weeks ago to seek treatment. I've done a screening and an evaluation and now they've suggested medication services. My first appointment with the psychiatrist is next week.

I still haven't told her what's going on with me, but I plan to in a day or two. I think she'll understand.

I just wanted to tell someone.",24Oct2019,4

I have severe social anxiety it's so hard for me to get out of bed in the morning because i can't sleep because of anxiety, and the thought about having to socialize makes me feel suicidal. Most of the time i take the easier way and just skip the entire day.

I always come up with excuses like ""just stay in bed other people skip classes a lot too and you will feel like shit anyway. And anyway why did i join this school when i hate it"" It's such a greedy habit that i have developed i recently dropped out of the same school and stayed at home for a year and got addicted to drugs (like adderall and kratom hoping they would help me but they just left me feeling even worse) for this reason now they gave me a second chance but it still the same like the time before i dropped out i really don't know what to do anymore.

The thing is when i'm in school it's not as bad as i thought it would be in the morning, but the process of getting myself there is such a struggle for me, i really want some help but im too anxious to go to a therapist because they wanted me to put in a psych ward because i told them about my suicidal thoughts...

206,"I know everyone feels lonely or like an outcast sometimes, even the most popular, happy, or social people. But I genuinely feel like I am not made to fit in with any other people. In my whole life, I've never had a best friend. I've never had someone I'm close to, someone who comes to my house and I go to theirs, or that I meet up with regularly and talk to about anything and everything. I've never had someone I text a lot and tag in my Instagram stories and have a kind of constant relationship with. Someone who knows everything about me and I know everything about them, and I don't feel awkward around and can share anything with. And I feel I will never have that. 

Trust me, I've tried. One person I thought was my best friend I'm still very good friends with, but they live far away and although we've known each other for years, we only talk every now and then. We certainly don't talk about all the issues in our lives and it always feels a little awkward when one of us opens up a bit. And they have their own life with different friends and goals. Another I thought was my best friend, in the space of about 6 months we went from being close and talking a lot to them acting as if I didn't exist at best. They hate me. They've never said it, but I know. They detest me. And I never knew why. Quite a few, it just never worked. They don't REALLY care about me. Like we're friends but I feel they wouldn't care at all if we just never spoke again, y know? I'm just... There. 

I just feel like everyone I get close to eventually drifts away, loses interest, or just doesn't care. I'm never the person anyone wants to see. I'm never the person that people organise a group event and think ""wow, I really hope ______ comes along!"". Like if I'm there it's not an issue but if I'm not no one even notices. In fact, I'm never even invited to the event. My old group of friends from my old job, the second I left the job (not on bad terms, redundancy) I was never invited to anything, never spoken to again. If they see me on the street they'll say hi and say they miss me and we should do something but it never happens. They never text me or message me just to say hi. They never invite me to their regular get togethers. I'm the only one of the group who's left out every time. I've tried to meet them, tried to organise things and they either make an excuse or they meet me when I organise it, but I'm the ONLY one who ever organises stuff. I've tried to keep in contact on social media and ask how they are and such, but they never start the conversations... So eventually I give up because I know that they don't care, they only meet/talk to me because I ask and they have nothing better to do. 

Maybe I'm just annoying or in some other way not likable. Maybe it's me. It probably is, thinking about it. But I just feel so isolated and depressed and like I'm destined to a life of loneliness and isolation. I know that sounds dramatic but that's how I feel. I genuinely feel that if I just disappeared completely no one would even notice. In fact, I know that no one would. 

Does anyone else ever feel like this? It's not just me being down or having a low episode, this has been a constant for me for as long as I remember, and it's only getting worse as the years drag on. It honestly makes me want to kill myself just because why stick around when you're a nothing, when you mean nothing to anyone? Why stick around for a life of watching others enjoy each others company and have a good time together while you're always far on the outside looking in? That's not a life I want... I'd rather die than live like that.",24Oct2019,35

214,"First of all, I don't know if this is fit to post on this sub, so if it isn't, then I'm terribly sorry. I""m new to the sub, and I just needed to tell my story to.. someone. 

I'm 23 years old and currently in between studies. I have no job/internship yet and I feel that in the state I'm currently in it's not gonna happen anytime soon. I still live together with my parents and sister, although I'd love to move out. 

Lately, as of the last half year, I've been feeling pretty miserable. I'm afraid to get a job, since I've got no experience and have no idea what I'm doing. I do have a bachelor's degree, but I honestly don't know why a company would wanna hire me. Due to this I've been incredibly hesitant with contacting potential employers. This is the cause of frustration with my parents, who are getting annoyed that I sit on my ass all day. I mean, i do cook occasionally and do some other things if they ask, but most of the time I do nothing. I feel like a waste of air and space, but I also seem to be unable to do anything about it. It's like something's holding me back. 

Combine this with an incredibly annoying phobia, germophobia, or more specifically, the fear of getting food poisoning. This started getting serious around March/April, and has been the cause of a lot of problems for me. I don't really wanna go into detail on this right now, but if you're curious, dont be afraid to ask something.  For now, let's just say it takes a big part out of my day, and it's exhausting. This also caused my parents to be even more frustrated with me, and me in turn being more and more annoyed with them. We're slowly starting to dislike each other, although I still love them, and they me. 

One of the few positives in my life was my dog. He always managed to make my day a little better, and I loved him to the end of the world. Earlier this week he suddenly passed away after an operation. On top of the above estabhlished problems, I now also lost my best buddy. As of right now I have little to no motivation to do anything anymore, even the things I like to do normally. Nothing is fun anymore, everything is a drag and I'm just going through the days barely feeling as if I'm even living. 

It's really fucking hard finding positives in my life right now, although I know that I don't have it all that bad. I got both my parents, a roof above my head, a college degree, friends, all of it, but then why do I feel so bad all the time?

Are there people that went through something similair? What did you do? and did it work? I just wanna get the energy back, the feeling of being alive and life being worth living.

I would not consider myself mentally ill (in that I'd have an illness may be defined with clear characteristika), but I know for f* sure that I'm not remotely well for my, objectively probably good, standards.

Currently (meaning: days, weeks), anger, agressivity and sadness are mutually dependent; sometimes they find their way through the fog of resignation to emerge into real, physical manifestations of these feelings, sometimes they don't and clog up inside (not that tearing up for a second would help long-term either, but at least it's anything). 

I'm sorry to bother you. I don’t even know what the fuck I'm talking about. I just... I just don't seem to know anything anymore these days. Not possible to grasp a clear objective thought. Thinking me of 1 year ago would have taken that as the gravest insult... Me of today just wants a fucking break of any and every emotion.

My struggle is common, but it's hard to find others online like me. I struggle with the following problems: bipolar II, generalized anxiety, and ptsd. My anxiety is the worst of my problems right now. In my teen years I started experimenting with makeup. Whether it was heavy or light, it's normal for a teen girl to do her makeup. It's a time to learn, grow, ect. However, my father for years forced me to remove any makeup I wore if he saw me. He'd also comment on the color of my hair, style of clothes, ect. Long story short I was shamed quite often. I fought back about his comments because I never agreed with him. But in the end, his verbal abuse has still turned into long term anxiety problems. 

Right now I'm struggling with feeling like a woman. I want to dress like an adult woman (maybe showing cleavage, expressing myself with fashion I think is cool, instead of wearing what is safe) but will feel anxious or worried about revealing that part of me.

227,"Hey,

to those of you who haven’t read any of my posts (which is probably 99.9% of you), I’m in high school and having a real rough time. 

I guess I should give a little background on my current “sitch”.

I was lucky enough to be born into a nice house, with many siblings, two parents that were together, grandparents, and a caregiver. My family had always been financially comfortable. In my child years I never had to worry about money. I went to a school that provided good quality education, and I had many friends. 

You might think, “what On earth is this privileged teenager going to complain about. How on earth could her life be depressing? It’s just teen anxst”.

Before the age of 10, my parents separated. I was left to live with my mom and sister 90% of the time for about 10 years. My mother was emotionally and physically abusive for the majority of those years. My sister would side with my mother and I was left to fend for myself, 2 against 1. I suffered with depression, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder. Those illnesses have lasted YEARS, and have been getting progressively worse. 

When I was finally old enough I was able to move into my dads house. Being away from my abusive mother, I thought that things were finally looking up. Although, I’ve had to pay for most of my things, and it’s hard to do on a minimum wage job, as well as keep my grades up so I can graduate and hopefully make something of myself. I then developed social anxiety, eating disorder, and panic attacks. 

I have lost all of my friends. I have lost my sister as well. I am currently being consumed by depression. I am the loneliest I’ve ever been. I have tried every way; reaching out to therapists, councillors, elders; attempted to make plans (have been rejected countless times), nobody invites me anywhere , nobody looks at me, nobody talks to me. I am a ghost that people see right through. 

Although I believe in god and will keep believing, 
I am finding it hard not to think that I am not meant to be loved. Not by my mother who only cares to abuse me, not by my sister who has never cared about my health and well being, and not by any kid in my damn school who see right through me and are cruel. 

So yes I may be privileged but I am also not in many ways. I am wondering if anyone can relate to this AND has gotten better or seen the light. Or just any advice 

Thank you I appreciate those who took the time to read this",24Oct2019,1
228,"I live in Oklahoma City and life is just killing me. It is pretty much even affecting physical health at this point. I need to go to a place where I can at least temporarily get better. I started my first job and i don't want to get so bad I am unable to get anything done or be a hindrance instead of help.

The biggest issues I have are anxiety, depression, and indecisiveness. 

I have never been up to counseling because of certain things involving life so just asking this is taking a lot.",24Oct2019,1

230,"I’m in Canada. I’ll spare you my life story and just say I’ve been through hell and feel like I’ve made massive strides in getting back to a good place. However, I recently moved from another province and have had to rebuild my support network. The psychiatrist I was referred to made me feel wildly uncomfortable, so I stopped seeing him and got a referral to see someone in the city. 

I need a psychiatrist specifically because I lost an important medical about a year ago and need somebody who can diagnose and prescribe meds. I already have an amazing, stellar counsellor that I am more than happy to pay for out of my own pocket. I can’t seem to find an answer as to whether I can contact a psychiatrist and make an appointment privately/pay for one out of pocket so I can see one sooner. Waiting months to see a psychiatrist is really holding me back in many aspects of moving forward with my life and I’m willing to shell out money to see one. 

In the event I can see one privately (without a referral) can anyone recommend psychiatrists in Winnipeg and area?

Thanks!",24Oct2019,1
231,Lately i’m starting to fall back down into my deep depression. Back in 2016 i feel into a deep depression and started self harming while being extremely suicidal coming close to many attempts. I would usually take more and more pills everyday before i slept to gamble &amp; see what amount finally takes me. One night i got so upset i took a huge brand new bottle of Ibuprofen &amp; a new bottle of nyquil just to wake up extremely sick pass out &amp; wake up to see another day. Since then I never fell back into that spot in my life until now. I frequently think about suicide and self harm. Knowing myself i might just do it its on impulse. I find myself beating myself up over the fact i didnt do enough to kill myself like I should’ve that i would have been much happier. Im scared because i want to live to see a better life but this huge opposite side of me doesn’t its conflicting. I hate it. Just needed to vent.,24Oct2019,3
233,"I dont really have serious problems cognitively, thankfully, but I do notice that I have issues with details and short term memory.

Im in college and one example of this is “the name game” where basically you have to learn everyones name in class in some particular order and have to recite it in a giant circle while everyone watches you. 

And Im horrible at it. I just cant do it. And thats just one example. 

Im pretty good at figuring things out, its how I pass my classes, but I just cant remember details and facts. I can study a bunch of formulas and I wont remember them. Im in English classes and people can recite all these authors and books off the top of their heads and ai just cant do that. 

I have issues with my memory and I am just trying to find a way to deal with it. And its the first time I think I have ever acknowledged it might be because of mental illness. 

Its weird, mental illness, because I never know what is IT and what is just ME",24Oct2019,1
