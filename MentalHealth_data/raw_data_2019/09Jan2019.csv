1,"To start, i’m a 15 y/o M. I’m currently in sophomore year. I have been telling myself I have social anxiety, but I only have ONE thing happening to me. In many situations, and it has gotten worse lately, my face has hot flashes and starts to sweat. I hate it so much. Presentations, speaking in front of people at all. I’m not scared or anxious to talk to people. I am scared to talk in front of people (like a presentation or socratic circle). I don’t know what to do because I hate this sweating thing going on. Am I the only one? Why do I sweat and have hot flashes for no reason? Is there any way to help and get rid of them? This really sucks. It puts a lot of stress on me as well. ",09Jan2019,1

I (23F) grew up with a brother (now 21M) who was my absolute best friend. I would do, and did, anything for him. When it came to college at an elite Ivy League school, I paid his down payment because my parents didn't want him to go that far. On birthdays Jordans were on his feet. When he needed help moving I did it, carrying his things/furniture to storage in NYC despite his absence, a solo task of 9 hours. However, in the last year and a half my brother has gone off the deep end. He took a semester off school, sits in his room all day, expects everyone to bring things to him like food, hygiene products, etc. My parents have do whatever he wants because they fear he's going to take his life if they don't. At a certain point, despite in the past calling me his best friend and the best sister, he 180'd saying I was the source of all his problems and the reason for his mental health problems. He cut me out of his life for 9 months but then came to me demanding an apology from me for causing his mental illness, but quite frankly, after much evaluation with myself and a therapist, I have no idea what I'm apologizing for because recognizing that at times I'm not the best person, to my little brother I genuinely don't think I have been. Him making me feel as though I ruined him has really personally affected me. I cry all the time and feel as though my brother died and I am a bad person. The realization that I have been a pretty good sister is only recent. I'm stuck because I'm afraid if I don't apologize he'll harm himself, but at the same time any apology that will come from me is going to be fake. I miss my brother, and I don't know what to do with myself. His erraticness has resulted in the worst year and a half of my life, almost as if my old brother has died. If anyone could give me advice on what to do; I'm going through a very difficult time.

To note, though, when my brother has been good, he has been great. He was my best friend. The only person I can trust. I'm stuck because I keep reverting to these images of what he used to be. :/

EDIT: Another question: how often do people tell untruthful things to their therapist to the point where they believe it? Ex: my brother says that that his therapist says my parents are the worst when I personally know my parents are unbelievably amazing, doing anything for their children. I worry that he has fed his therapist with untruthful information and so whatever the therapist says back to him he takes as truth. Is this common?",09Jan2019,1

5,"I have been this way for as long as i can remember. 
Waiting to die is painful.
I am forever being told that it does get better and that i can be happy. What they dont understand is that at times i am happy. I dont feel sad constantly. I do feel enjoyment out of things sometimes. 
At times i am depressed and the feelings of not wanting to exist start to intensify and morph into suicidal thoughts. 
Not wanting to exist is there no matter what frame of mind i am in. 
People assume its an illness but can i not just be a person who really does not like life? Why is it so difficult for people to believe that a human might not like living? 
I do have mental illnesses, im not dismissing that. I just dont believe my thoughts on not wanting to be here are a part of that. When i feel suicidal, that is a part of the illness. 

I dont like the world. I dont feel like i belong here. I feel so out of place and i think that is the reason for the likes of my anxiety. 
I genuinely wish that i was never born. I deliberately dont get medical checks so no intervention can happen. 

It is hard to get that across to people in real life. They either assume its my mental health, that i am suicidal or the thoughts are so uncommon it freaks them out and think i am weird. ",09Jan2019,1

11,"I am sitting here after a great day and saw something on YouTube that inspired me to post to those of you who maybe lurking and afraid of talking to someone and seeking help. 

I was extremely overweight my whole life, a big drinker, and suffered anxiety and what I now know was depression. I was just getting by, until I received a diagnosis of liver issues at the age of 29... I dismissed it and finally came to a realization that I was self medicating with alcohol when I had to get a biopsy of my liver and was fearful I had caused irreparable harm. I quit that day, and began to notice my symptoms more around anxiety and depression. 

Several months later I finally gave in at the age of 30 to try medication after years of saying I didn't need it, and making excuses. Almost immediately I began to feel more energy, less worries, less stress, less anger and outrage. I began to workout everyday and started Crossfit. 

I am now 31, and am the healthiest, strongest, and best version I have ever been of myself.

I'm an 18 year old boy, I'm also gay, I have extremely thick skin, it takes a lot to offend me, in order to be anything LGBT you need to have thick skin.

  I have found myself with amazing friends who are fine with me being gay, and comfortable around me (more or less) but i dont think any of them would stick up for me if someone started any shit with me. 

My friends are the types of Republicans that dont really care about me being gay, but my best friend, goes by what the bible says (""everyone lives with sin"") so hes essentially saying my sexuality is a sin.  And I'm close with my friends to the point where we jokingly call eachother slurs.


But my allies are small in numbers, and there are far more people who's business end of their hatred is pointed at me. It's actually really sad, and depressing when I think about it.

When it comes to homophobia, I'm all on my own..I dont want to align myself with any side of the political spectrum, I'm just independant, but everytime I try to stick up for myself, I'm called a libtard, triggered liberal, And I dont even WANT liberals on my side..

Basically, I’m depressed. I know I am. I’m not some twelve year old whose sad because they can’t find a date for the dance. I have seriously wondered if my life means anything to anyone.

I want to live, but sometimes I don’t know that I deserve it. I would never do anything to intentionally harm myself or others, I just wonder if I should give up. Resign myself to nothingness.

I want to speak with a therapist, and have asked my parents to set up sessions on multiple occasions. They haven’t yet. They don’t know that I’m depressed. I suppose telling them might help them understand I need to talk to someone, but everytime I think about telling them I’m crippled by fear. I don’t know how they’ll react, if they’re going to laugh and think I’m just trying to get attention, or if they even believe in mental illness. I don’t know what to do.

I attend an online school due to health problems, I rarely talk to others outside my immediate family, and most days I do nothing. I’m left alone with my thoughts and nothing but time. I struggle everyday trying unsuccessfully to lose weight, my teeth are in terrible condition, and I can see all my friends surpassing me as I was held back.

24,"Hi everyone. I've had a long long battle with depression since my early teens. I think I ""beat"" depression about a year ago - by that I mean, I feel much better, happier, etc. even if I do have small periods of sadness here and there (Nothing like my previous depressions where I was constantly sad, sometimes suicidal, and involved in some self harm). 

And while I am content for the most part - I feel like I lost this huge part of myself. I feel like I'm not in sync with my emotions, and like I'm almost just constantly distracting myself from feeling things by keeping myself constantly busy.

I'm not really sure how to explain this - but it would be comforting if other people could share if they've experienced something similar, and how to get out of it. 

A part of me wants to go back to being depressed because I at least felt like ""myself"" - sometimes I'll just put on really sad depressing/triggering music to feel like I'm still me or actually here. I'm terrible at articulating. But yeah- any relatability would help me feel less crazy.",09Jan2019,1
25,"Lately, my brother has been showing signs that he is becoming depressed again, and it's gotten to the point that I feel he may be wanting to kill himself. I don't know, it might just be my anxiety, but... I don't know. What's even scarier is that the first time I felt this way, it didn't really bother me. I mean, he beat me a shit ton when I was little, and at the time, I hated him for that, and when he started showing signs of suicidal thoughts, I didn't think twice about it. I never thought ""good, he deserves it"" but I still didn't try to do anything to help him. This time I want to change that. What can I do to get through to him, tell him that I care about him?

29,"i’ve read that what i have could be called “just right ocd” but i don’t know how valid that term or the article/website is. most of my symptoms have to do with things having to be even or balanced out or done a certain amount until it feels right. to be clear, i am NOT asking for an exact diagnosis for my symptoms. i know that you guys can’t properly diagnose me, but im just asking if my symptoms are generally associated with some sort of ocd or other disorder. another thing, im not claiming that my problems are very significant or anywhere near as bad as others have it. i understand that my symptoms are mild compared to what others are going through. thanks you :)

some things i do:

- [ ] if i’m aware of them, i try to avoid stepping on cracks, especially in sidewalks, sometimes on tile but it’s obviously more difficult, so i’m usually able to rationalize stepping on them pretty easily. i’ve read that some don’t think this is a symptom of ocd, and it might not be, i don’t really know, which is why im here. but i definitely think it’s a symptom of some disorder, it’s not normal the way this stuff affects me and my thought processes

- [ ] i’ll sometimes tap on my phone screen in a certain way so that the places i’ve tapped are even (for example if i tap somewhere on the left side i’ll sometimes tap on the right side in the same exact place, or if i tap on the top of the screen i’ll tap at the bottom in the same place to “even it out”)

- [ ] i pick at my face a lot, usually when im stressed about something. could just be an anxiety thing, or something else.

- [ ] if i touch my hand on something, i sometimes have to touch it with my other hand.

- [ ] if i itch something on the right side of my face, i’ll sometimes itch the same spot on the exact opposite side

- [ ] i “balance out” my blinking a lot. if i feel like one eyes been closed more than the other i’ll try to balance it out be blinking the other eye or making one eye open wider than the other to make it even. i also noticed that if i see something that might be “unbalanced” i’ll sometimes compensate by sort of squinting one of my eyes. this is weird i know but it’s not that noticeable if you were watching me while i do it.

- [ ] i hate certain materials/the sounds they make. for example, cardboard scraping cardboard, metal forks or spoons on teeth/scraping fork on teeth (fuuucking hate that), fork scraping plate or bowl, the feel of velcro (not the soft side), this one material that some wind breaker jackets are made of

- [ ] if im going through the playstation 4’s menu’s, usually when im in the library section looking at my games, i’ll scroll over/highlight the games in a kind of pattern, usually i do a figure 8 or infinity sign type motion hovering over each game, in order to “balance it out”, again. because the game library section splits the games into three columns, i try to select/hover over each game equally to be balanced. for example if im hovering over a game in the middle column and then move my selection thing over one to the left column, then i’ll usually move it back to the middle column and then one to the right column afterwards to even it out. if i’ve hovered over too many games in the left column, ill balance it out by scrolling over games in the right column until it feels right. this probably makes no sense without a picture or physically showing you what im talking about, but i can’t really do that in text :(

- [ ] if im playing a game and i move the camera to the right, i’ll usually move the analog stick (controls the camera) back to the left to even it out. a lot of times i also try to tap the side of the analog stick on one side (for example the right side), then try and tap the exact same spot on the EXACT opposite side (on the left side). 

basically, a lot of times i’ll move the analog stick on my ps4 controller in the same exact way but in the opposite direction that i originally moved it in order to “balance it out”. i’d say this happens the most often as i play games all the time, so it’s a lot more noticeable.

- [ ] i need the volume on the tv to be on an even number, or if it ends in a five (like 35 or 25) but never an odd number. i just don’t like it, idk why haha

- [ ] when using a calculator i’ll click the clear button over and over even if i know that it’s clear. this might just be a people thing though cause i’ve heard others (that likely don’t have ocd) do this aswell, so i don’t know. it could also just be adhd

- [ ] i don’t really have any of the overly cleanly symptoms that some have. i don’t scrub my hands till they bleed or anything (might be a stereotype that i’ve learned from media, correct me if im wrong), i just wash them like the average person would. in regards to my room and especially my backpack and stuff from school, im actually pretty disorganized. the one thing that i will say i don’t like is hair on clothes. if i see a hair or something similar on my hoodie or something i will immediately try and get it off. it bugs me when, for example, someone in front of me has a hair on the back of their shirt, but i obviously can’t just reach over and take it off haha.

- [ ] not sure if it’s related or not but here’s something else i thought of. i don’t really like when one shoe is sort of stacked on top of another shoe. i just like it a lot more when they’re right next to each other side by side, without overlapping or anything.
please don’t take this post as me trivializing ocd as some might think (judging from the pinned post one the ocd sub reddit). im genuinely wondering if it’s possible that i have mild ocd or some other disorder(s), which would explain a lot of these behaviors. the last thing i want to do is make people mad over a question i have

32,"I had been planning my suicide for about a week I guess. Killing myself has been on my mind for months, and yesterday was the day I had decided on. 

I had a good day at work. I hugged my loved ones. I even ran up and down the dark halls of my old high school with my cousin (around 9pm), reliving old memories and laughing until it hurt. Overall, it was a great day. I enjoyed what was supposed to be my last day of life. 

I went home. I prepared everything. I put four envelopes on my bed: a letter to my mom, dad, best friend, and a paper with general instructions for my finances/last wishes/and my pet lizard’s care sheet. I cleaned the house, made my bed (something I never do), and took out the trash. I took a shower, shaved, and put on the clothes I wanted to die in. 

The plan was to cut my wrist vertically and bleed out in the bathtub for easy cleanup. I sterilized the blade as a habit of a long term self harmer, but this time I there would be no gauze or Neosporin nearby. 

I took a deep breath. I placed the blade where I would make the cut. I hesitated. 
Did I really want this? 
Yes, dumbass. There’s no turning back now. Stupid cunt. Just do it, you’ve waited so long for this moment. You got this. 

I made the cut. It wasn’t deep enough. That wouldn’t do it. That wouldn’t be enough to kill me. I cut again, deeper. I cut 5 times total. It was enough. It hurt unlike anything I’ve ever felt. I watched it bleed a while, turning it over and let it drip. 

I started to get dizzy, and I started thinking. I started panicking. 

No, this wasn’t what I wanted. I didn’t tell my little brother goodbye. I didn’t tell him I love him. I didn’t hug my grandma. Shit, I didn’t include her in my letters. What the fuck was I thinking? I don’t want this. There’s so much I forgot to do. How could I possibly forget when it’s the only think I’ve thought about for months? 

I snatched a towel from the cabinet and applied as much pressure as I could. Dumb. So dumb. Fucking idiot. I ran to my room, grabbed my phone, and called my neighbor (I live in the middle of nowhere, calling an ambulance would have taken forever). I called my therapist and explained the situation. She calmed me down and talked me through things until my neighbor arrived to drive me to the hospital. 

They stitched my arm and put me in the psych evaluation room. I waited 2 hours for someone to come talk to me and see if I needed to go to a psychiatric facility or whether I could go home. During those two hours, nurses were in and out. One nurse drew blood. One hooked me up to a machine to check out my heart or something. He put stickers attached to wires all over my upper body. One asked for a urine sample. 

I have never felt so powerless in my life. They made me wear a paper jumpsuit, for fuck’s sake. 

Finally the person who was to evaluate me showed up. She did not give one single care. Her questions were mumbled and apathetic. I had to ask her several times to repeat the question simply because she was mumbling and I couldn’t hear her. Anyway, I was released and got to go home. 

Now I’m stuck with this scar and a weak explanation as for why I’m wearing a wrist brace (too hot for long sleeves) because I’m an indecisive pussy. The end. ",09Jan2019,1

34,"Hello, so I am asking this question because there is a lot going on currently and I am just very confused. So to start off, I am 16 years. You should know that I grew up in a very toxic environment. I've had to witness my siblings, not me, get abused growing up, and it took a very bad toll on my life. Around the 8th grade, I noticed that I began getting moodier, and when I entered high school, it skyrocketed. However, I convinced myself to believe that this was just normal mood swings caused by my hormones because of puberty and whatnot. I didn't start questioning this until I hit my junior year. Before I get there, you should also know that my home life is not healthy at all. I have Caribbean parents who are very strict. I am not allowed to leave my house AT ALL. I am only allowed to go to school and back home, unless I am going somewhere with one of my parents or relatives. I was never allowed to go to a friend's house, walk anywhere, not even go to a store or movie theater by myself. My parents are also not there for me emotionally. To them, it's like providing a home and food/clothes is all you need to do to be a parent. My family life at home is also extremely toxic and I feel as thought I been neglected in a way while growing up. Since I've started my junior year, my paranoia and anxiety got worse, I felt like I started to  be clingy with my friend whenever she would hang out with others, and my sensitivity got worse as well. I remember around two months, I told my friend about how I believed a comment about me in class, and all she said was ""don't worry about, it probably wasn't about you."" I don't know why, but this got me extremely mad to the point where I didn't talk to anyone for the rest of the day. I try to be very careful to make sure I don't do anything that might cause our friendship to break, because as it hurts to say, she's my only true friend. I began to realize that my mood constantly changed abnormally. I would be happy one moment, but the next I would just get so upset and wouldn't want anyone to talk to me. It came to the point where I would go home and cry myself to sleep at least 4 times a week without telling anyone about it. The next morning, I'd go back to school and act like nothing happened. It hurts to keep going through this, and it's mentally exhausting. It takes a toll on my academics because all of the crying and drowsiness causes me to stay up late and try to complete my homework. I never tell anyone that I cry because I'm afraid they'll tell me I'm overreacting or being stupid. I am very insecure and I get so mad when I fall behind on grades because to me I feel as though that's the only thing I have going for me. It's like I believe that if I don't have a strong academic profile, then I have nothing to offer from myself. I beat myself up when I get a low grade in class and try so hard not to cry in front of everyone. I often get mini panic attacks about something you may think is small, but to me it's a big deal. For example, a teacher once told me that I asked a stupid question and this was back in the 7th grade. I constantly think about if the people that were present still remember it and if they told other people and whether or not they have a judgement of me based on that situation. I know I might sound crazy, but I honestly don't understand why I continuously think these things. If my friend doesn't answer my text,I normally start to believe that they don't see me as important or maybe I said the wrong thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

If that wasn't bad enough, I can never escape pain. When I go to school and suffer, I suffer when I get home as well. Like I said before, I feel neglected in a way and because of what has happened in my house in the past, I constantly feel depressed because of the outcomes. It's like I have no one. No one can relate to what I feel on a constant basis. I've done my researched and feel as thought I might have some things, but I won't bother mentioning them because I don't want to self-diagnose myself.I want to try and do well in school so that I can afford to go on campus for college because I want to see a psychiatrist. My parents are foreign, so they don't really understand the whole mental illness thing and won't listen to me if I tell them i need to see a therapist. Hell, they might actually get angry with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of you who might read this might just tell me it's hormonal teen issues, but I have big feeling it's not. Any help?

35,"I made a journal template a few months ago and I have found it useful, so I am sharing it here. It is slightly complicated, but you don't have to use all of the cells if you don't want to. Basically, every day you enter in values for your mood, anxiety, and whether you performed a certain habit or not. The habits I have in there are social, sleep, supplements, stretching, meditation, guitar, reading, and jogging. There are more clarifications to the right of the journal in the document. The values needed to get a 100 are entered into the first week. The goal is not necessarily to get a 100, I just wanted a consistent way to track my progress at these habits and I don't like all of the habit apps, so I built my own. The reason sleep is a 2 is because you can go to bed on time, but wake up late, or vice versa. I made the socializing habit more complicated because I believe that it's important to be social and to keep track of how often you are social if you have social anxiety like I do. What gets measured gets managed, right? But I weigh certain social activities much more heavily than other ones. Feel free to change this all up if you want to!

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to adjust the math, just keep in mind the bottom row of each week has math in it that creates a score out of 100 for each different habit, and the YELLOW box to the right is where the final week's score is displayed. That box just takes the average of all of the other scores.

&amp;#x200B;

The CBT portion of the journal is such that you can double click any cell and view a whole page of a journal entry at once. It's more difficult to read all the way through than a word document, but the point is to be able to look at a few paragraphs of journaling while seeing as much other data as possible at the same time, on the same page.

&amp;#x200B;

With this journal, you can easily copy all of the text from an entire week of journaling and use a word counting app to see what your mind has been on the most lately. There is a word counting app available as a plugin for google docs, although I am not necessarily recommending it. I sincerely hope someone else finds this journal useful. I don't think it's necessary to use it every day of your life, but if you are into journaling and knowing data about yourself, then this should be fun for you.

&amp;#x200B;

The first link is editable, so someone might ruin it for some reason, but I put a second link to a non-editable version that you can download and upload back to Google Docs if you need to use that. I couldn't figure out how to share it in a non-editable form that would also let people just make a copy. If you know how to do that, let me know. Thanks!

I should note that this journal is impossible to print...

37,"I have no thought to mouth filter. I get told to focus on mindfulness and my breathing on a regular basis. I’m always told to slow down, relax, and stop thinking so much. I work on these things consistently, yet my thoughts just won’t stop running sometimes. I’ve tried being in nature. I’ve tried medication. I’ve tried exercise. The only thing that really helps is staying busy and engaging in intense experiences that do not put me to sleep. Great at parties. A hit at shows and conferences. Yet uninvited to holiday gatherings and unwelcome around the calm and collected. I cannot “just be” and am always on.

I’m fine until the holidays happen, in which I go from having acquired a fair amount of wealth and status to downright losing my home and ending up at some hostel or Airbnb in bumfuck, USA. From the towers to the sewers because I am unable to simply pause and calm down. Highly capable yet unable to just exist. I realize where I went wrong. I could not relax, no matter what. Despite what I had accomplished in my life, I was doomed to fail because I couldn’t relax.

40,"I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder in like April. I was previously diagnosed with only Generalized Depression and anxiety 2 summers ago. So, basically since then, they have narrowed down my diagnosis and diagnosed me more specifically. Anyways, I was prescribed Depakote ER 500mg  and Zoloft 100mg. I now only take 75mg of Zoloft as prescribed by my doctor daily. I am off depakote completely. 

The issue is, I feel like fucking shit. 95% of the time. I feel stagnant. I feel like there is literally no point in me taking my Zoloft because it does nothing for my depression, and if I FORGET to take it, it fucks with my head extremely badly.

46,"I got to school early today to talk to my academic counselor. It was the first day of second semester and I was really nervous (but also excited?) to find out if the schedule change I had requested at the end of last semester had been approved. If so, I would finally be out of the absolute living hell that is my English class. 

I was mislead by my current teacher into taking this class when I asked her if there was a lot of public speaking in the AP class. She said no. See, I think for most people 5-6 presentations, essay readings, in class ""stand up"" quizzes (where you get put on the spot to answer a question that decides whether the entire class gets points for that question), socratic seminars, or assignment presentations per month would count as a lot of public speaking, but not for this teacher.

My anxiety skyrockets when I have to speak publicly. It completely consumes my entire life. I don't eat for a full day beforehand, I don't sleep several nights in a row, I occasionally throw up, I usually go through an anxiety attack shortly beforehand, and, if it's really bad, I pass out. If I do make it to the actual presentation, it's a mess of tears, stutters, anyways you get the point. It's *bad.* I am lucky to be on a 504 at school that allows me to do presentations in front of my teacher only, but my English teacher finds all the loopholes in it to the point where I am left literally powerless. Last semester in that class was terrible, as you may be able to imagine.

Anyways, after expressing this with my psychologist, she let me know that she could write a recommendation to the school to get me out of the class. I was ecstatic. I walked into my academic counselors office the very next day, handed her the note, and requested a schedule change. She let me know that I could only be taken out of the class in the 2nd semester. She put in my requested and handed me an appointment form to check back in with her after break. I was so excited.

My request was declined. Something about a strong recommendation by my teacher against it because she thinks I have ""lots of potential."" So now I'm hopeless.

61,"I'm not the best person. I don't know how else to write this, so I'm going to list some of the bad traits I've noticed, things I do and say that just feels so natural until later when I think over what I've done and realize how \*not normal\* they were.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I feel as if the world owes me something. I don't outright say it, but I feel my personality is leaning toward that thinking. I just look at people and expect them to be nice to me without me having to put in any effort. Yeah, I'll jump at the chance to do things for them, respond to them if they make small talk with me, or just smile at them in general, but I feel those aren't enough considering I don't actually talk to people or acknowledge them until they make the first move (which I know is a real shitty thing to do, but I just don't know what to say or do around other people).

\- I'm not the greatest daughter. I am short with my mom and treat her the same way she treats me, which I know is wrong, but I can't help but do it. It just feels natural to just not give a crap about her feelings and such like she has done to me, my brother, and sister. I want to change that. She's been saying she wants to kill herself ever since she quit her job that she's been working at for years and it scares me that I can't feel anything but annoyance any time she says things would be better if she killed herself. I hate how far my lack of feelings for her has gone and it terrifies me.

\- I'm not the best sister. My mom has pitted us against each other for our whole life, things like shit talking one of us to the rest of us. For example, for some reason my mom hates my sister (ever since we were little) and has always talked shit about her to me and my brother. As a result, we see our sister as someone who's disgusting, lazy, and a nobody despite her paying the majority of the bills and actually having friends outside of the family. She goes out and do normal things, the only thing that's true is her being a slob by never cleaning her room (piles of clothes in corners of the room, trash like candy wrappers and junk in the drawers, etc.).

Because of the way our mom has raised us, I don't feel any love for my little brother (20) and older sister (23). I feel the same unnatural dislike my mom has for my sister, although I feel that my dislike is so much lesser than my mom's. I want to change how I treat my sister.

My mom (M) would take stuff from my sister (S) and give them to us. Things from food S had bought for herself and just things in general. And I take it. It really scares me how much I don't care when these things happen until S discovers what happens. I feel S is so unwelcome in our house, but she has no way to leave since her credit is too bad to move. I really want to change how I treat her, but I don't know how.

\- I don't know if I'm depressed or just lazy. I don't shower regularly, I don't clean up during my days off, I hate going to work and being around other people, and I just hate getting up from the couch and leaving the internet unless it's to go watch a movie. I think I'm depressed, but I don't know. I want to say that I feel like I'm in a black hole with the light of the stars behind me in a tiny circle signaling the opening of the black hole and how deep I'm in it. I'm floating in a space of nothing, yet there's this pressure closing in all around me. I feel weightless, yet heavy at the same time...if that makes any sense.

\- I am a heavy procrastinator. I know what I want to do with my life, but I can't work up the motivation to do anything. I know what I need to do and how to do it, but I'm just watching as the days turn into weeks then to months and I'm still working at a job I hate.

\- If given the chance, I'll lie to save myself. Things that are so obviously a lie and makes my heart pound because I know it's wrong, but I can't stop the lie from coming out. It literally just slips out. And it's over the smallest things, things that won't negatively affect my life. It's stupid and ridiculous.

Those are the top things I can think of, but I know there's more. I want to place the whole blame on how our mom raised us. She didn't teach us how to be respectful adults, she just sat there and expected us to know what to do and how to behave. Her discipline methods was to beat the hell out of our asses with a belt. I feel with physical discipline, a parent should set a limit of spanks to the offense, but she would just keep hitting as if she's working out her anger, and it's usually over the smallest of things (me and my brother were never spanked for burning paper and leaves in his toy truck, but my sister was spanked for shouting at my brother in an argument they were having). And of course, with us taking after her, we treat each other like shit. There are good moments where we're a family, but 95% of the time we're at each other throats.

I want to change the person she turned me into, but I don't know how. I think therapy is the only way, but I keep putting it off to look up later. My brother has been in prison for 3 years and he gets out in 3 weeks. He has these plans to get himself and us out of the hood, but I feel that as soon as he steps foot back into this family, all of it will be squeezed and drained out of him. My sister has been saving up money and my mom calls her evil each time S denies giving M any money (and it's never for anything important, mainly for things that could wait until we get paid again), and I know she'll do the same to my brother. I want to change who I am so I can be someone my brother can depend on when our mom eventually turns against him.

I'm sorry this has gotten so long, I just need a push in the right direction to better myself. It feels like I'm asking too much for this sub and I'm really sorry for this.

TL;DR - I feel that the person that I am needs to go. I feel that my mom is toxic and was the main problem in how I turned out. I feel stupid trying to say my mom was the main problem, but I can't see it any other way. I want to change myself for the better and become a better person, but I don't know where to start.

63,"I've been taken out of school to do homeschooling, but that's not going well at all. My mental health makes it nearly impossible to do anything. I have to do everything myself, which I'll get into why later. I recently lost my cat, and things have been going downhill. Suicidal and Homicidal thoughts are going up and I can't go a day without crying so hard before feeling so numb. I keep having bad memories, so many. I'd call my mom neglectful. She's always gone. Screwing other people, hanging out with friends, she stopped making dinner when i was 10, or any meal. She forces affection on me and snaps so often and gets mad at me, i'm constantly afraid of making her sad and upset. it's been engraved in my memories, making her upset, is literally worse than anything. It's always about her feelings. I can't tell anyone about the fact she forcibly hugs and shows affection. She kissed me once, on the head and i spent an hour trying to clean myself off because I felt so uncomfortable and I ended up cutting myself because I couldn't deal with it. My brothers been hitting me, choking me, slamming me into walls, literally hurting me so much. Sometimes grabbing knives and threatening me with them, he never does anything but laughs when he sees im in fear. I can't say, I have any family. I've never been close with my dad, although he's been here for me the most, I still can't really call him ""my dad"" infront of other people. I say, I'm a single child because that's what my brother wants. He doesn't want me to be his sibling. I bet once I kill myself maybe he'll be happy. My parents got involved too soon and had kids too soon. They both regret it. I feel like a mistake. I'm so afraid to tell anything like this to my therapist because i'm terrified of what my mom will say. I don't want to hear her yell again, she's so loud and i feel so scared when she does that. A few months back my mom and brother got into a psychical fight, and I was awoken to my mom screaming with this horrible horrible voice that sounded not like hers, to call the police. I couldn't find my phone. I began freaking out, I couldn't breathe, I felt extremely suicidal. I fell to the ground in shock and pain, when she says she was leaving, I didn't know what to do. I was glad but scared. She came back 2 days later. I wished she didn't. I feel so lost with education and everything. At this point, I'm so so close to committing suicide. I don't want to do this anymore. I can't. I'm so lost, I don't know what to do and I know I'm not gonna live another year. I haven't set a date yet, or a method but I've been thinking hard, maybe I could jump from a bridge, but surviving isn't an option. ",09Jan2019,1
64,"I wonder if I disassociate often. I find I often doubt my memory, find it hard to understand the concept of permanence, get strange feelings that I can’t really describe other than strange, hyper aware? Of my body, things don’t seem real at times, sometimes feeling as if in a simulation, depth/zoom perception? Like things seem too big or too small, sometimes at the same time, doubting my thoughts, like when choosing how to word a sentence or find the correct word.

65,"Today I woke up and realised that I had lost all sense of reality. I no longer feel like i have a grasp on what is real, what is not; what is important, and what has meaning. On my walk over to the lab today I started to realise how disconnected from the world I feel. As I was walking and looking at the environment around me I started thinking about it in detail. I was trying to be more in the moment, but in doing so I felt even more disconnected. When i tried to instead think about the past or the future I found myself unable to, memories all seem like a white hazey blur, and the future just seems entirely blank. Not blank in the sense that I can make it whatever I want to, but instead empty, as if I cannot even envisage a future of any kind significant enough for me to want it.

As I got onto campus I started to think again about the present moment, and about what would happen if I didn’t exist in it. Not in the sense of not existing at all, but instead in that specific moment and time; if I suddenly disappeared and had a different life, what effect would it really have? Are my current and previous actions really all that important? If I were to suddenly seem to stop being around, what would people think/do? 

I wonder if my teachers would worry, or would they only notice my absence because of missed work reminders, rather than actively being aware that I am no longer present.

The more I try to be mindful of my thoughts, my fears, and where they stem from, the less connected I feel to them. It seems to me that when I take the time to actually think about the things that are affecting me, they themselves lose all of that meaning I was placing behind them; and if those are the things that motivate me to act and think a certain way, then removing that meaning leaves me with nothing at all. I question everything that i assign meaning to, my thoughts, my actions, my choices, my relationships, my possessions. They all have a meaning based in past and emotion, but if I remove that meaning by being more aware of why they have meaning, all those things quickly lose their significance to my life. 

The things I thought defined me, made me who I was, and gave me a purpose, suddenly mean nothing at all; so why was I so concerned with them in the first place.

In a sense, it gives me the freedom to live in the moment, and not have any form of attachment to any one idea, person, or quality. But, it also makes me question if I am searching for something that doesn’t exist. I feel like I want to start over, find something new, experience new things,and make those connections and meanings that I believe in, and after analysis remain something that I am happy with, but I am unsure if those things are possible. Is what I currently have the best I will have? Will I continue to be miserable and feel insecure about my own mental health the more I look for something to make me feel more complete and secure in my life?

66,"Due to a lot of sexual trauma in my childhood, I'm hypersexual. It gets in the way of my life on most days, and I have yet to really find a good coping mechanism for dealing with it. The obvious answer might be masturbation, but when I do that just because of a hypersexuality episode, I end up feeling like absolute shit afterwards for a few hours. Anything I can do to deal with this more healthily? I don't think jerking off every time it acts up is the best option given how bad it makes me feel, but it's very hard to ignore.  


Please don't comment if you're not aware of what hypersexuality is, dismiss it/don't believe in it (this includes equating it to ""teenage hormones"" in underage survivors), or believe that you don't need sexual trauma to be hypersexual!

69,"I've been feeling very paranoid for some time now, and recently it has started to become crippling and impair my ability to get through the day. I've gradually become hyperaware of my surroundings, and loud or sudden noise can send me into panic mode. I was never much of an anxious person before, but now I'm plagued with horrible anxiety. The worst of this is that I constantly feel as if someone or something is planning to do me harm, or a horrible event is going to occur. It's incredibly difficult to keep my back turned in any kind of open space, as fear will build until I start shaking uncontrollably and have no other choice than to appease my mind by checking my surroundings. Only a short time afterward it will happen again, and again, and again. This fear is even worse when I'm outside or in large areas, to the point where even leaving my room is a daunting task.

I don't understand what this is or why it's happening to me, and I've been extremely reluctant to seek out a professional or try to research this. Respectively, because I have a deep mistrust of therapists and psychiatrists, and I don't want to fill my mind with even more dark, anxiety-inducing thoughts from what information I may stumble upon.

72,"So as the title probably hints to I have hit a terrible rough patch, and I am doing everything I can to fix it, but there is a lot of wait time and I would love some support so I don't feel as alone in this. 

I lived in the city where I grew up for 27 years, my familiy there is very toxic and abusive and would openly mock my mental illness or claim I am of less value as a person because of it. (It affects my ability to work, and for them money = worth).

I was in therapy weekly and that kept me (mostly) above water.  In sept. I moved to a different city on the other side of the country and my mental health instantly improved.  In nov. I rented my own apartment, and got a cat (lived with friend until then). My mental health took another massive positive step. Now on new years eve I was told I have lost the apartment, after just 2 months of living there, and I have 2 months, but preferably 1 to move out. I have the landlord breathing down my neck, but due to me not being able to get any income other than absolute minimum gov.support, my rent money is limited, and I can't afford an actual move. My mental health also makes it impossible to have flatmates, and nobody wants a cat. 

I have the choice of loosing all my belongings, accept flatmates on the cost of my mental health, and keep the cat. 

Loose the cat, which is my main emotional source of support, and possible some of my belongings and move into someone's basement or something

Or

Keep the cat and all my belongings, but move away from the city where I have now built a mental health treatment plan along with doctors, move away from the posibility of any work, move away from my only family that is not toxic - and live in a house isolated away from everything, together with a previous abuser. 

Now I am keeping that cat, so it's either 1 or 3, but people really negatively affect me. So I have applied now for government housing just until I get more income and can support myself, wait time for reply  4wks, and then if approved, an additional wait until I know where I can move, so I am hoping for it, but so so scared it won't come in time for the end of rentig-contract. It's also super strict and require me to have lived in the city I apply for for 2yrs, which I have not. My case worker who helps me navigate the system said people have had exceptions made before and I should just hope for the best, but with what is riding on it, I am so fucking stressed. I don't have anyone to talk about this with. The non-toxic family that live nearby got severe cat allergies, and also is mourning a death of a close friend now so the last thing they need is me adding my issues on top.",09Jan2019,1

It's hard to describe but the best way I can is this; you know when you're going to sleep and sometimes it suddenly feels like you're falling or that the bed is spinning? Well that's how my head is feeling. It's also accompanied by a fuzzy feeling towards the top front area of my head. At night it's so bad I'm just crying because of how weird it feels.

I made the mistake of googling it and it says I've had a stroke or have a brain tumour. I know this probably isn't the case but it's terrified me and I can't get to nor afford a doctor or a hospital trip.

74,"I have narcolepsy, broke it off with a potential new gf. Been struggling with my narcolepsy for 2 decades. I thought now that I was diagnosed that things would be easier. And it was. But then I was put on an antidepressant to help me sleep (I know, narcolepsy and sleep seem hand in hand... They aren't). I was originally put on armodafinil and it worked. It worked so amazingly. All these years of not being able to get up on weekends. But the antidepressant... Don't take it if you are clinically given it. Antidepressants are so close to impossible of getting off.

I worked in a job I loved. For 10 years. This secondary antidepressant drug literally ruined my life. When I noticed that I was becoming tired again earlier, I expected my narco doctor to reduce the antidepressant drug. Nope. He increased it.

That was the worst decision of my life. I lost my long term partner, I lost my job. A job of 10 years.

My advise to anyone is to avoid antidepressants as much as you can. I wasn't depressed. Even if I was, I feel that being put on this shit (Pristiq) would only make it impossible to actually return to normal. It's taken me months to scale down from 100mg per day to 25 mg every 4days.

Now, I'm on nothing aside from my original narco pill. Thank fuck. Seriously. I'm so pissed off I was put on an antidepressant. It nearly killed me. I was planning suicide any chance I had. Life was horrible. I met a girl and thankfully I broke it off because I was at the limit.

For anyone hanging in there... Hang in there. Even if tomorrow sucks, there'll be one day you rise above it. Don't just go ahead with ideas of drugs that may help. Simply - avoid antidepressants as much as you can. They nearly killed me.

Speak to someone. See a psychologist or psychiatrist. Get  a mental health plan. Make a routine of it. We all need that routine, whether it's work or organised as a 3rd party. Just ask for help.

I grew up believing I was a strong character. I didn't understand mental health. I thought those that were suicidal were weak and couldn't work out how on earth they could do what they did with suicide.

But now that I have been there... My God. The world needs to update itself. People go through this. Most won't ask for help. I didn't. I was stubborn. Most are. Stick with it. You'll get there. There is another day. Finances are stressful. Family is stressful. Unemployment is stressful. But the world is better with you in it.

I have my fall back days even though I got off the antidepressants. It took a long time. I didn't think if get there. Message me if you can't handle it. There is a silver lining. We all have interests. Most will not pick us up financially. But they are there. Stick with it. You are unique. You have a view on SOMETHING that others haven't expressed. Go for it! ",09Jan2019,1
75,"If anyone has a likewise mind and wants to share too or has advice or anything, itd be helpful. TLDR will be at the bottom if this is too long.

I started realizing because of the reactions ive gotten from family and friends that i dont care about others like most people do. I can be quite cold at times. I care if someones hurt or if their lifes in danger but i dont care to be around them, interact with them or do anything for them unless truely nessesary. I used to as a small child though. Anytime my family talks to me i roll my eyes and just want to get away but stay usually just so i dont cause a problem. Occassionally i wont accept a hug from my mother and this upsets her deeply and she'll yell at me and loss her temper. When shes not crazy or drunk, shes extremely overbearing and wants my constant attention. Its normal to go do occassional stuff with a loved one i think but she wants me to do stuff with her all the time, usually daily and its taxing and anytime i show disinterest she usually ignores this and if i say clearly i dont want to she gets angry with me. When im away from home for a few days at my friends (im an adult) she misses me but she also seems jealous of my time and asks weird questions about my friends so i try hard to keep the volume down when speaking on the phone and get off as soon as possible. She talls so much. All the time. And she embarrasses me to no end. Shes like this with other family too but more with me prob cause i show the most disinterest. My dads dead due to his drinking problem. He loved us but i never felt emotionally connected to my dad. He was emotionally distant all my life and I just didnt care to be around him when i got older. Both my parents constantly fought and when drinking it caused trauma for me and my sis because of the violence. They both hurt eachother physically and my mothers hit us all at different times, me taking most of it when she drinks. My brother has extreme anger issues and repeatedly hurt me and others deeply emotionally and i dont really talk to him now. My other brothers an alcoholic with a violent past with people and drug use and all that shit but he wants to be there for me and my younger sis. My older sis is a liar, distant and never talks to us. She didnt even go to our dads funeral. My younger sisters autistic but has mostly grown out of it. Shes just super introverted, lazy and acts like a child. Thing is despite these things i know they still love me, at least most of them. But i dont return the love. And i dont care much about others either. I avoid talking to family members, even my younger sister. I dont pick up calls usually and hope they just stop wanting my attention. Plus i dont let any other family members in either, like my aunts, uncles or cousins.
My friends are a little different. My best friend ill talk about after the others.  I have respect for my friends and they brighten my day, thus i spend time with them but its more for a selfish reason i think because i dont care about them as much as i should. I still have a problem with wanting to see them like i do family and sometimes only agree to hang because i feel i have to to keep them around.
My best friend on the other hand is literally the only person ive ever truely cared about and sacrifice things for purely because i want to, not because i think i have too. We had a little history 3 years ago in highschool (we're both girls) that was very confusing and only resulting in kissing so we stopped to preserve the friendship. Ever since ive had feelings off and on and i care about her more than any person ive dated as well because, like everyone else, i dont care about people that much, even my romantic partners, except her. Ive noticed paralells in how i feel for my best friend and how she loves me. Ive noticed that other people who love me want me around like she does but i just dont.
I feel this is a problem. I am reaching out because i feel im missing a big part of life. I feel like all the love i have focused on my best friend should be the same for all my other loved ones and friends but i just dont feel that way and i dont know if thats bad or warrented toward my family and the things they have put me through. Im aware i may be selfish but im definently not toward my best friend. I care about her happiness more than my own. And shes been through similar things that i have growing up. She even has this same issue of not caring about others except me and our one other friend. Both our dads are dead for the same reason. Its like shes ment to be in my life. We always have fun and theres not a day that goes by that we dont talk to eachother, even if just over text. I think this is what its like to be in love with somebody. She doesnt know about my residual feelings however and it kills me because i cant tell if she still feels that way or just as her best friend.
Ive had persistent depressive disorder, anxiety and dissociative symptoms since middle school. I just wish i could have the connection i have with my best friend with others since this seems to be how normal minds work. Not the in love with them part, just the fact that i should be able to care about other people like i do her, right?

TL;DR: Basically ive had a traumatic homelife and i cant connect to others around me emotionally. I dont care to be around people who want to spend time with me but ill do it anyway because i feel i have too to keep them around. I only care about one close person to me whom i care about more than myself. I wish i could connect to others the same way i do with her but i just cant.",09Jan2019,1

83,"Hi, with the recent popularity of the Shane Dawson series on psychopaths/sociopaths came many people whom seem extremely willing to critique it with their own accolade of “ I myself am a psychopath/sociopath” which really led me to wonder... why in the world would anyone admit that they’re a psychopath/sociopath? 

I mean, it does not bring any benefit at all, and on the contrary, it seems to bring more cons than pros. People would be afraid of you, shy away from you, look at you through tinted lens. Your future actions will also be questioned and scrutinised for any hidden agenda and your current relationships might be strained especially considering the negative perception of sociopaths/psychopaths in the media (which you have to admit, are based on certain degree of truth, e.g.serial killers).

No doubt a psychopath/sociopath knows this, given their above average intelligence and calculating nature, so why would they choose to expose this more than undesirable side of themselves(especially given that they like to create better facades of themselves)?

84,"I took a big step yesterday towards bettering my mental health. I have suffered depression and anxiety when I was younger but now only anxiety. I finally opened up and talked to my new doctor about it. My original primary care physician closed down and yesterday I went to a new place. I have a few questions about what happened.

The doc did a psych questionnaire and asked about suicidal thoughts or hurting others. Now, I have thought about suicide methods or methods of hurting others just because I'm weird like that and my mind wanders often. However I have not thought about actually killing myself or actually hurting others, just methods. I'm a teddy bear and wouldn't hurt a fly and I would never kill myself. But yeah I will admit I've technically *thought* about stuff like that. Since I haven't realistically considered doing anything like that I answered no to both questions. Was that wrong of me?

I have another question. I told her I have anxiety bad. To the point where I don't feel comfortable around my own family even though I love them. I'm always worrying about what people think of me. If I go shopping by the time I get to the cashier I'm already sweating due to being around so many people I do not know. I hate being the center of attention. This is coupled with what I suspect is ADHD. Trouble multitasking. Showing hyperfocus towards the one thing I am doing to the point I cannot hear people talking to me until my concentration is broken. My coworkers have even noticed. She scheduled me to see a behavioral specialist. But also prescribed me Zoloft for the anxiety. Her exact words were ""I'm not sure if this is what you need but take them in the meantime until you see the specialist and see if it helps"". That was my first red flag.

For some reason I remember hearing bad things about this drug so I did some research. I got the pills and looked up the side effects. Basically I'm scared to take them now because I'm afraid of the side effects I'm reading and bad reviews from people.

Talked to my sister about it who is a nurse and she said it might be a good idea to not take them and just wait it out til I see the specialist because PCP's apparently hand that shit out like candy as an umbrella drug. 

The problem is that I do not know when my appointment with the specialist is yet, and I have a follow up appointment in a month with this doctor for my lab work I had done. I'm scared of showing up to my doctor asking me about the Zoloft and having to say ""Hey sorry I didn't take the pills you prescribed me"" and having to explain myself to her.

Do you think I should wait it out to see the specialist, or do you think I take the plunge and try the Zoloft? This is a serious concern to me, so please take it easy on me Reddit, Thanks.",09Jan2019,1

86,"My family and I have a complicated and strained relationship. I moved back into my parents' house after college and now live with my mother (59), father (68), sister (33), and her daughter/my niece (10). 

My mother has a history of emotional abuse and alcoholism. We get along okay, but I have a lot of unresolved trauma from bearing the brunt of her abuse growing up. She also can be really immature, and can't see beyond her own frustrations. My sister is a pathological liar and a textbook r/raisedbynarcissists parent. I'm sure you can see how having these two around makes the house feel like a powder keg. 

My dad and I have taken it upon ourselves to be my niece's form of stability, and I always try and separate her from situations where my mom and sister verbally (borderline physically) have it out with one another. But today, apparently, is the last straw for my sister. My mother accused her of stealing money from her, so now my sister is threatening to pull my niece from school at the end of the year, saying she'll move out of the house.

This terrifies me. My sister is (supposedly) always at work, meaning I see her daughter/my niece more often than she does. Despite allegedly working 40-50 hours a week at a decent pay rate, she still doesn't have enough money to pay my dad for ""rent"" (only $100 a week, and he's often lenient and doesn't ask her for the money at all). All of my niece's toys, clothes, etc. are things that me, my dad, or my mother have bought her -- my sister didn't even spend a dime on my niece for Christmas. We don't know where her money goes. 

I know that if my sister moves that my niece will suffer even more than she does now, but I also know that if my sister does decide to leave with her, and there's nothing I can do about it.

I feel the intense need to self-harm, even though I haven't done so in months. The thought of eating or drinking anything makes me sick, and all my mind is doing is racing at the thought that my niece will be left with strangers, go unfed, or worse if my sister does end up leaving. I'm also feeling intensely guilty for making this situation about myself and my mental health (even as I write a whole post about it, ha). I'm not sure how to handle this.

**TL;DR:** My sister is threatening to take away my niece, one of the most important people in my life, and putting her in a potentially unfavorable living situation. How do I cope with this?",09Jan2019,1
87,"Yesterday I decided to take acid, I'll spare the details of what it really felt like because this isn't r/LSD, but after a while of riding the trip I had a major panic attack snd was scared that I was going to impulsively kill myself. Is this normal? ",09Jan2019,1
88,"Here are some things I really need to get off my chest:

I am not a happy person. I feel fleeting moments of happiness, but overall I am not happy. I feel more and more the need to convince myself that I like my job, because I can no longer tell if I’m being abused by it or just being overly sensitive due to past emotional trauma. Every time my mom tells me she wishes I lived closer to her, all I can think is “No way in hell” and then I immediately feel guilty. 

Every time I leave my therapist’s office I feel pretty good and hopeful, but that feeling never lasts long before something happens to chase it away. 

I have one friend whom I trust enough to share my vulnerabilities, but I don’t feel safe doing so with the rest of my friends. I love that friend like family, but I also feel like the only reason I have any other friends at all is because the two of us were treated as a package deal. They wanted her, and got stuck with me. Logically I guess that probably isn’t true, but my emotional state doesn’t always respond to logic. 

I have anxiety and constantly worry that nothing I’m doing or could ever do is good enough for the people around me. As a child, I thought that if I did everything possible to fulfill someone else’s needs, they would do the same for me. Thinking like that made me feel that there was something I could do to fix the fact that my needs were being neglected. I don’t know how to stop thinking like that. 

My anxiety once got triggered by a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons in which my character had a heated confrontation with her daughter that caused me to subconsciously recall similar confrontations I’ve had with my own mother. 

If you’ve read this far, I salute you. ",09Jan2019,1
89,"I'm 30 years old and I've been with my boyfriend for 8 years. We're getting married in the next few months but I'm scared about the future.

I've never been to a psychiatrist but from some researching I believe I might have BPD or some other type of mood disorder. Every few weeks or so I blow up on him for percieved wrongdoing on his part. Sometimes I even think he's only with me because he's using me for extra income and will leave me in the next few years which is ridiculous. I've thought he's cheating on me, lying or even being with me out of pity.

After these big fights happen I call him horrible names and accuse him of ridiculous things. The next day I wake up and think ""Why did I say that? What was I thinking?"" When the fights happen though I truly believe everything I say and can't get myself to stop thinking it. I feel so much guilt for days afterwards and I hate myself for being so cruel to him. I do everything in my power to make it right and apologize profusely. I'm scared that one day it might not be enough and he'll leave me. He's an awesome guy and says we'll make it better but I'm still so scared and confused.

90,"For the last year, I have been struggling with the resurgent effects of depression. I suffered badly for several years during school, a mixture of home pressure and bullying. But after leaving school I knew a few people who helped to drag me into the real world. They eventually drifted away, but I thought I had made enough changes to my life that I thought I was over the worst of it.

The scary thing is that I did not really know that it was happening, it was a slow creep that changed me so slowly I barely recognised it and the effect it was having on me. I lost interest in daily life as a whole. I stopped seeing people, stopped going to the gym, stopped taking supplements, stopped writing, stopped gaming, stopped reading. My life just became a cycle of work, home, eat, sleep repeat. I did not even care that I had undone nearly two years of weight loss within six months.

I have to thank my brother for helping me out this time. During my usual Christmas stay at my parents, he physically forced me to go out. He brought me along to meals with his friends, encouraged me to talk to them and drink with them. And for the first time in months, I felt something other than hollow. It felt like surfacing briefly from a deep pool, only to sink back down again without realising.

That surfacing, brief as it was, seems to have eased something. I started using a notebook, writing what emotions I had felt that day. Since Christmas day, it has only been in the last four days where I have definitively felt anything. Most of those have been negative, with one day having a positive emotion (Christmas day itself).

In the last four days, I have noticed my appearance again, even though it is overweight and pallid in clothes that show every flaw.  I feel shame about how I look and anxiety about how I am seen in public.

But they are emotions, and they are not blank pages.

This post has become a bit rambly, and I know that everyone experiences depression differently, with different triggers and different solutions. This is not a post about how to deal with depression, I am still a long way from that and have no right to tell anyone how to live their life as everyone suffers differently.

This is my story of my first steps. And I can add 'determination' to my notebook, the second positive emotion.

The three of us were inseparable, and while it seems that my buddy has moved on from Bill's death I don't think I have. I've seen therapists and I've tried talking, but I'm still to this day tormented over Bill's death by my own brain and my inability to let it go. I have dreams all the time about Bill, and most of them he's alive in the dream and doesn't realize he's dead, so I go through the motions with him and I generally wake up sobbing. It had been a while since I had any dreams about him, but two nights ago I had dreams about him and he was dead in the dream. It was me at his house going through his things with his mother, and I'd wake up from the dream and go back to sleep and it would just pick right back up.

Ever since then I've been stuck in this rut where I feel like I have this constant black cloud over my head and I can't seem to kick it. I want to cry almost every waking minute, and just can't seem to get my mind off those dreams.

Does anyone have any input as to what might be able to help me, should I go back to therapy if I feel that the first time there wasn't really any help?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on the verge of an anxiety attack right now. I work as a receptionist. I haven't been able to sleep well in a few days, and I'm working on a total of 6 hours since monday. I wanted to call out SO bad this morning especially because I've been in a funk since yesterday. Slipping between anxiety and feeling completely numb. But i didn't call out because I feel bad about leaving the place in a frenzy (i'm unfortunately the best worker we have up here). I'm the first shift, full time person. 90% of the work/busy time of a whole 24 hour work period (position is 24/7) is during my shift. I'm running on fumes, and my patience is wearing thin. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 2nd shift person calls out today. I WANTED TO. This makes me feel SO shitty right now. I'm fuckin miserable. Nobody else cares if they screw their coworkers over. The part time fill-in, who, even though she complains about not getting enough hours, said she couldn't come in to fill in. They have one more employee to try before they ask me to do a double. ( i just had back surgery a few months ago and physically cannot sit here for a whole 16 hours). Like wtf. Why do i always have to be the dependable one? I'm fighting back tears bc I'm so fuckin aggravated. Every phone call is pissing me off. I feel bad that I have an attitude towards my fellow employees and visitors who've done nothing wrong, but nothing can shake the way I feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: don't have to do a double. But i'm still pissed about my missed opportunity to grab some peace of mind and sleep today. Thankfully I'm transferring departments in a few weeks and if I need to call out, it won't be that big of an issue. They're interviewing potential receptionists as I type. Can't fuckin wait.

Thanks for reading my vent, if you did.

TL;DR: Wanted to call out of work, didn't cause i don't like screwing people over. 2nd shift person called out - screwing people over. Fill-in person said she couldn't come in - screwing people over.

94,"I think something might be wrong with me, but I don’t know what. Sorry for the long post ahead.

A few weeks ago my mom said that I have been acting different lately, and that I haven’t been myself. She couldn’t really give me any concrete examples of why. I didn’t think that I was acting differently, but took her word for it, and told her that I would try to be more self-aware of what I was doing and how I was acting. I assumed that my anti-depressants might be not working and I hadn’t realized it yet. 

This weekend we went to the casino one day with a family friend. I was having some period cramps, but other than that felt fine and assumed that we were having a good day. When we got home that night she wouldn’t talk to me and I assumed that something was wrong, but didn’t want to push it. The next morning when I got up, she told me that I had completely ruined her day. She said that I was acting like a spoiled brat, and that she gambled away $200 just because she was pissed off. I asked her what it was I did that made her angry, and she said that I was just acting “like a spoiled brat” and I rolled my eyes at her. I truly and genuinely do not remember doing this, and I think she mistook me shaking my head or looking away or something for eye-rolling. I was genuinely shocked by this, and actually started crying because I felt so bad. I apologized genuinely and profusely, and couldn’t stop crying for the rest of the day. I felt angry that she called me a spoiled brat, because I don’t think that was deserved and I really and truly don’t know what I did wrong. I didn’t talk back to her, though, because I was raised better than that and know that it wouldn’t do any good. She accepted my apology and said it was “over and done”, but I’m still upset about it. I make the money for the two of us and work my ass off, so the spoiled brat thing really dug deep into me (I didn’t bring this up, though, because I’m not an asshole).

I will be the first to admit when I have done something wrong, and it’s totally possible that I was acting badly that day, but I really truly don’t think I was. This scares me that I am not acting like myself. I scheduled an appointment with my doctor to maybe change my anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication because I think that maybe it stopped working and that’s why I’ve been acting “different”. But I feel like I’m going crazy and need a mood stabilizer or something to just shut my emotions off. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, and I’m genuinely afraid for my mental health that I’m bipolar or borderline or something and don’t realize it. I feel like I have acting the same as I always have, but apparently not. Is there any weird personality disorder or mental illness that can cause this?? Sorry again for the long post.

95,"Since HS I've been very depressed/recluse and an addict due to a bad relationship and bad choices, also some bad memories from childhood. I can work jobs fine. Due to my lack of health mentally and physically I had to withdrawal from college a few months back, I feel like a totally different and negative person from two years ago. I was so addicted and depressed that I told my parents I'd get help but kept doing the same things.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. Again I've applied for college and I'm working but then as soon as I realize college is soon I have a panic attack at night and had to go to the hospital for passing out.  So I have to withdrawal again from college, this time I'm actually taking steps to get better but my parents don't believe me. Keep in mind I'm currently making an income, but my parents are flipping their shit about me not going even after showing them my appointments for the doctor and stopping all drug use. They think I'll do the same thing again, but I haven't lost any money from withdrawing from college. I really want to go but I'm so mentally/physically messed up that I literally feel nothing and have 0 order, so  I feel that I need to make a recovery before going. I know I did mess up with college but I have to not feel this way and be capable of focusing/learning like I did before in HS so I can get good grades and be able to maintain a job while going.

TL;DR: My parents are shaming me for not going to college and saying that I'll never go, but I'm only 20 and its only a 2-year degree.

99,"About 3 years ago I experienced what I think was a panic attack. I was in college so Ive had my fair share of experience with marijuana and adderall. I was also frequently going to the gym at the time, so I was also taking creatine, and pre-workout which is basically junk loaded with stimulants and caffeine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the gym one day and took pre-workout. Mid-day the following day, I took an adderall (don't remember the dosage since Im not really prescribed for it), and smoked some weed at night. All I remember was bending down to get something in my closet and then felt EXTREMELY dizzy and disoriented when I stood up. Everything I heard sounded like it was echoing, my skin felt itchy, I was shivering but sweating, felt like i couldnt breathe right, and I felt a sharp pain in my chest and an overwhelming sense of fear. I tried to sleep it off but just could not help it, so I stood up but immediately vomited. I felt better afterwards, but had brain fog that lasted about 5 days after the incident (couldn't think straight, felt dumb, zero concentration. Everything felt dreamy). The paramedics that night took my vitals and didn't see anything wrong, they just said gym supplements tend to have a lot of junk in them and I just needed to get it out of my system.

&amp;#x200B;

I just dismissed it as a panic attack. But I randomly thought about the brain fog three years later today... Could I have had a mild heart attack that caused my brain to be oxygen deprived, hence the brain fog? Can heart attacks go away? If so, can paramedics and doctors see signs of previous heart attacks through taking someone's vital signs?

102,"Good day,

Not a frequent poster and a native english speaker here
Haven’t posted in a long time, god knows how it works. Just looking for anyone’s two cents on this topic.

To start off, I’ve been to 4 specialists. Two psychologists, two psychiatrists. First psychologist experience wasn’t so good, after that I’ve just been sceptical about it. 2 years went by and after things have gone a lot more severe and things were even more rough than ever before, I’ve decided to finally give it another shot. Here I am, with my second psychologist at the current moment. First psychiatrist was a private one, in between of the two psychologists. Got diagnosed after two visits, at least got that out of it. Dropped her after that, it was too expensive to watch her sit and not say a word for 45 minutes.  It was all about Social anxiety disorder at this point.

Back to my third and current specialist (psychologist). I’m just lost whether I’m expecting too much or just blind, oblivious to the “help”.  She denies everything I’ve been telling her, presumes her own things, literally just stomps on me emotionally. Haven’t been to fourth psychiatrist much, as she only gave me a paper document of  a trial of homeschooling, as I’ve not been able to go to school.  

Is it supposed to be like that? Is it normal? Am I just too dumb for help?

My girlfriend said it's sort of scary how much I forget things so I know it's not just me over exaggerating. On top of all of that what's more concerning is that I have a serious problem understanding things that are explained to me. If someone tries to explain a situation to me or I'm trying to learn something new through having it explained for some reason my brain just can't keep up and I get lost. All the words being said begin to have no meaning and it must show on my face because people then ask me if I'm  understanding.

I'm finally ready to let them know everything instead of thinking that everything they do will me me worse. Whilst I've been okay enough to stay away from the various mental health services, it's still been pretty difficult to get through most days but due to my past experiences I've able to use that to keep myself somewhat sane.

Anyway, I'm getting a little too old to keep changing jobs every few months and completely messing up my life every few years. This time I may lose my flat and job which is a bit of a pain but shit happens. If this happens then I plan to get a gym and swimming membership to some local club and hit it pretty hard for 6 months, stay on meds, do my appointments and stuff and re-evaluating if I can get back into work and my own accommodation from there. 

Does anyone have any experience with using physical fitness to get better? Can anyone recommend a pretty intensive plan that I can have a look at? 

I don't take recreational drugs much anymore. Maybe once or twice a year. I pretty much stopped drinking all of last year only really starting again recently when my sleep levels dropped to a hour or two per night. Obviously I plan on dropping these again once I'm back on meds but I thought after dropping them the first time that would be half the battle. I do smoke tobacco but as far as I'm aware it doesn't have any negative effects on your mental health so I will continue the fight against that one.

So I go to the hospital, both nurses who help me are so good and nice. Then the doctor came, the doctor desmissed my case completely. Made me feel worthless and stupid. All she did was give me meds. And sent me home. We tried telling her that I was not safe at home and I was scared that I would have another blackout. ( They happen randomly once a week or twice. I have no control over them) she pretty much said because I don't want to kill myself they can't admit Me. So I said when can I come back. What if the pills don't work?  She said until you have another accident we can't do anything. I felt lost, I felt hurt. She wants me to go home and potentially hurt people just so they know for sure something is wrong.

I’ve had chronic nightmares since I can remember. Actually, I’ve found out that some of my earliest memories are recalled nightmares and didn’t actually happen.

I am used to having one or three “mild/medium” nightmares (which I wake up from) the majority of nights with maybe three or four days a month with some sort of relief and three or four really rough nights. 

It’s generally pretty damn exhausting and I’ve been sick of it for years now. I generally wake 4-5 times a night on average with 4-5 hours of sleep a night. I can always recall dreams and they are incredibly vivid and physical. They can completely throw me off for the whole day.

I’m really getting run down after years of this shit.

As of last night, I’m really not sure how much longer I can handle these nightmares without losing it.

Last night, I had one of the worst I’ve ever had in my life- i haven’t even been able to verbalize it to my husband it was so bad.
It involved absolutely hideous violence and felt like it lasted days. I soaked completely through my pajamas, sheets, comforter and quilt and woke into a massive panic attack, nauseated and crying. 

Didn’t go back to sleep.

Have not been able to function today at all. It’s been one big panic attack all day.

I desperately need relief, advice, techniques!! Please, if there’s anything that has helped you- or if you have something similar - please share!

I’ve been diagnosed with a few disorders: schizoaffective - bipolar type, nightmare disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

I attend regular appointments with a psychiatrist and a therapist.
Currently taking seroquel, Zoloft, prazosin for said nightmares, and ambien on a case by case basis.

tl;dr - I’m on the brink of losing it if I can’t control my chronic nightmares. I need advice/ techniques to get some relief ASAP!

118,"Every time I look for advice from someone, or read about mental health online, the process for most people is this: they start showing symptoms that they recognize as such or that are recognized by their parents as unhealthy or worrying, they express their discomfort, their parents take them to a doctor (or they go by themselves) and they get diagnosed, or at least have someone else in their life notice that they are not well. This never happened to me.

I grew up with troubled, depressed parents and was emotionally neglected all my life, so no one ever questioned if I was ok despite having unusual developmental history, self injurious episodes as early as three years old, crying too much for no reason, not sleeping and actively avoiding other children. They distrust doctors and don't like admitting that there are problems to resolve, so I kept being told I was normal despite being a textbook case of childhood GAD with OCD traits (I constantly had obsessive thoughts about my parents dying when they were out of the house even for a few minutes only, even if I had never experienced an accident). I grew up thinking it was absolutely normal to live like this, that this was the standard human experience, and I didn't realize until middle school that it wasn't true.

Despite only getting worse and becoming essentially a shut-in, it was never a problem for them so they let me be, and I still believed everything I was experiencing was just me being a bit too sensitive. When I found out about anxiety disorders online, I just thought yeah I guess that's me and still didn't think it was a problem. I only decided (by myself) to see a psych at 22 after a severe burnout and a lot of self diagnosis, and when I was diagnosed with GAD (and purely obsessive OCD) I was disappointed because that's just so normal and I was expecting a more serious disorder that would explain why I am like this. I already knew I had anxiety, that's nothing weird to me. That's normal.

I struggle to take my diagnosis seriously because I deeply internalized that it's a normal disorder and it's so common that it's not even an illness. I don't know how to get rid of this thought. It's just such a normal disorder to experience to me that I doubt if I'm really mentally ill or am making it up. I end up literally researching ""is anxiety an inherently mild disorder"" so often to reassure myself and never get the answers I need - it's still such a normal thing to experience to me, so many people have it.

Did anyone else experience this? I really need to know I'm not alone. I sincerely can't relate to most posts about mental health because all those people seem completely different from me and are able to conceptualize their disorder as such.",09Jan2019,1

120,"I’m from California. 'm a 16 year old male and my uncle is 22. We both grew up together and he's always been there for me when I needed him. We're like brothers. I have few questions to ask because this is a tough situation and don't know what to do. This happened about a year and half ago. My uncle confided in me that he was sexually abused when he was 5 by a a neighbor years ago but somehow forgot about it until now. These memories came flooding all of a sudden and started to remember. He was diagnosed with PTSD and the doctors gave him pills for it. Somehow that made his anxiety worse. I also learned he was struggling with his sexuality. He looked very shook. One day he was really depressed and he wanted to ask me something because he thought he was really sick and that there was something really, really wrong with him and he wanted to get help for this problem. He told me he had a problem that was kinda personal and he trusted me. He confided to me that he thinks about men while masturbating. He said he didn't know if it was normal for a guy to be thinking that. He didn't know if that meant he was gay. I didn't know what to say. He then asked, "" well what do you think about when you masturbate...Women?"" I said yes. He then said, ""so its not normal to think about men, is it?"" I said No. He was shocked and I was a little freaked out as well. He really didn't know he was gay. He then said he thinks the abuse made him ""psychologically gay"" because all his life he thought thinking about men was normal up until recently when started questioning his sexual orientation. He asked me what he should do because the pills weren't working and didn't know what he was doing anymore. I told him to go to counseling. He said he was going to go get help immediately. I felt bad for him and worried. Now a year and a half later, he's still going to counseling and dealing with these problems. We still hang out but he's changed. He doesn't smile anymore and says that he feels ashamed and embarrassed about everything. How can I help him? Did the abuse make him gay? In this situation, was it wrong for him to ask me what I think about when I **** and can he get in trouble? In this situation, was him asking me that a form of child abuse/sexual harassment, yes or no? Did he do anything wrong? Do you think he was trying to come on to me?",09Jan2019,1

123,"I know y'all people probably went through some real shit in 2018 and I won't even come close, but this is just how I experienced last year. 

I started off 2018 very well. I was doing okay and I was motivated to really study for my A-level exams. But, as expected, I procrastinated a *lot* and kind of went crazy with overthinking and worrying that it was even harder to do something. I worried over failing, not being good enough and all that. Time passed by and I don't know how I did it, but I actually did ""okay"" for my standards. I was so relieved and then I was faced with the decision what I was going to study and where. Again, I began worrying, so much I couldn't handle my emotions, I cut myself after years of no physical self-harm. I applied to several unis and got accepted to my ideal uni because I wouldn't have to move. 

My semester started in October and I was motivated at first, but then my mood dropped, like a sack of potatoes. I have no future plans, I have no motivation, I have no direction and I was thinking on changing my major, but I believe that no matter what I'll decide to do, I won't ever be good enough. I just won't and it's so demeaning. 

I feel like I'm slowly giving up, or maybe I already have? I haven't been doing any studying. All my homework I do last minute and I've already missed deadlines (thus failing two classes, I think). I actually have to yet submit my homework   today, but I find myself... not caring😞? I don't really care at the moment, but I know the panic will hit me soon and then I'll drown in a sea of hopelessness and self-loathing. And everything's just shitty, because drinking (not much of course) and self-harm have become coping mechanisms. Overall I just feel stuck and a lot of all *this* is my own fault.",09Jan2019,1

130,"I just want to cut straight to the chase. 

A and D are partners and own a house where their kid O lives, and where A's sibling T lives. I live 30 minutes away and don't have a car, but they are reachable by phone.

T has been mentally unwell for the past 5/6 years.

T has delusions that the government (namely the big politicians, but not Trump, Trump is ""draining the swap of the bad people"") are paedophiles and have various sex rings around the world that include sex trafficking.

T has stated that they know people who have gone missing and have been killed to cover-up these sex crimes.

T spends the majority of the day on social media being an activist speaking out about these people (George Soros, Hiliary Clinton, pizza gate etc) and reading news about sexual child abuse cases all day.

T believes that one of their family members is a russian spy. T believes that they were sexually abused by one of their siblings when they were younger (proven untrue). T believes that they had 2 dads growing up.

T stays up all night on their computer and goes to sleep in the morning. T wakes up around lunch - dinner.

T stated that they have passed on information to the police about sexual abuse cases (info is sparse) and that T is known to the police around the area (hasn't been proven true or false).

T refuses to talk about their problems, stating that T would put other people in danger if they told them. On more than one occasion, while discussing T's problems, T will start looking around to see if anyone is listening/watching and will start whispering.

T does not hear voices or sees things. T has been been diagnosed with depression so far (clinical). T is on medication (anti-depressants) but has stopped taking them due to feeling ""subdued"". T has been booked for 2 mental health assessments but couldn't complete one over the phone because it was too traumatic and the second time physically made their self ill.

T rarely leaves the house and doesn't like to go out in public for long periods of time. 

T will victim blame often, and will cry and become distressed when dealing with family confrontation and make out that they are the victim (A's words).

Any task given to T (big, small, doesn't matter) will overwhelm T and they will become distressed, start crying and repeats the phrase ""everything is so difficult"". A (T's sibling) will give T cannabis that they smoke together with tobacco.

T will not eat during the day but will occasionally snack on something small (bitesize chocolate) and eats dinner that A and D cook for the family (but T will occasionally deny it).

A (T's sibling) is going to the doctor's tomorrow to book an appointment and hand in some information to T's doctor about the events that have been going on. Another family member and I believe that A enables T and is close to neglecting T. A has recommended holistic practices instead of going to the doctor/dentist (T has awful teeth problems such as abscesses) such as putting honey on T's teeth instead of taking antibiotics.

I believe that A let's T sleep in until past noon and has rejected proposals of setting up a timer for the internet (A doesn't want to seem like the bad guy). A offers T weed which I think exacerbates the problems but T claims it reduces their anxiety. 

My questions:

1. Should I challenge their delusions? At the moment I just listen and don't say much. Do I enable the delusions?
2. What if T refuses to speak to a doctor? Is there anything that can be done (UK)? They are not a danger to themselves or others at the moment, but it could always take a turn for the worse. 
3. What should I say in terms of convincing T that they need help? They seem aware that they aren't okay, but don't realise the full scope of how ill they really are.
4. Should I convince A to put a timer on the internet? Should I convince A to stop giving T cannabis if possible?
5. What are things that I can do to make T suffer less? How can I improve T's quality of life?

Any advice at all is welcomed. I just want to make T mentally healthy again. I want T to stop suffering in pain and I'm willing to go far and tell my family (A and D) that they're really hindering T's efforts of getting better.",09Jan2019,1

How is that the kind of action taken by someone who is mentally sound? How is that the action of someone who is fit for living? Or anything, really? I have no averages. I'm either feeling extremely good or extremely bad. I'm either extremely happy or engaging in self-targeted extreme anger to the point of sweating profusely. How the fuck does anybody live like that? It scared me that this is what my life has become and I have struggled against myself for an amount of time that I have long since lost track of. From a mental perspective, it's as if everything I do is for the sake of survival. Merely existing, but not living. Ever. Going through the motions, constantly looking down while walking because the road is uneven and you have tripped so much your knees lack any skin, exposing all the bone inside and making it hard to move. I'm not sure why I even bother living. I've fantasized so much about dying. Hanging, throwing myself in front of an oncoming subway train, self-immolation, stabbing, gunfire, my brains blown across the asphalt as some poor coroner comes to collect my remains and delivering the bad news to my small family. And even that is pointless because no message will be sent. It's just the end of suffering and all that's stopping me is some primal instinct of survival. But that's it, survival. I don't even live. I just exist as a reactionary physical entity, constantly in fear and protecting myself against it, in the most futile manner possible because at the end of the day none of it matters. I'm sick of being such a pathetic existence, but I know there is nothing I can do to avert it. This isn't mere fatigue or mental exhaustion; it's just sheer lack of true, human desire. An object exists, but humans live. In that sense, I really am just an object.

The medicines are conserta (for my add) and Zoloft (for my anxiety and my non severe depression). So before I started taking this medicine, I was a bit more energized and out going, although I felt really insecure because I was overweight from wanting to eat all the time. But lately, I feel as if I was better off before taking the medicine. I feel very tired, depressed, angry, and a little dizzy from not really eating. But the feeling I hate the most is the depression/boredom that I have from it. Its like I get upset over everything, nothing makes me feel calm or content. I'm always upset. It really started happening this year after taking it. I used to be able to think about people that I am in love with, most of them are celebrities or idols that I don't know personally. But when it think about cuddling them and whatnot I wouldn't be so upset, but now it's like all of my thoughts have been worn out and when think of them I just feel ugh and like there getting repetitive or something.

144,"So last academic year I just started medical school. I fell into depression at the end of first term/January. Told my GP about it in February - she signed me up for CBT which had a 6 week waiting list. I wanted antidepressants but was not prescribed it as it could interfere with my epilepsy (just my luck).

So nothing to treat my depression it kept me awake at nights and caused me to miss lectures the next day. I spent most of the day not revising and just... worrying.

CBT started at the start of May, though I only managed to fit in about 3 sessions due to therapist being busy and had postponed a couple to revise for exams. 

Failed my exams. Had to retake all of them in the following august (spent revising from 5 to 8 hours a day during this period). Failed again by a small margin.

Now I'm retaking first year. I'm commuting to university. My parents don't let me join societies or go to the gym (let alone socials) as I let them down last year by failing. I've not got much of a social life - I have two friends who I don't see too often and they don't do much besides studying.  Last year I had loads of friends and used to go out to party often (before depression).

I finished my CBT and was feeling better but relapsed due to failing my exams, leading all my negative thoughts to come back. I'm lacking motivation to study.

Had a few ""dark thoughts"" but never would really act on them... for now at least. 

So great, am I gonna spend the rest of my student life lonely and miserable?

Oh how I envy the calm minded students passing all their exams while using their freedoms to drink the night away...

TLDR: Depression made me fail exams. Overcontrolling parents. No social life. ",09Jan2019,1
145,"As a bit of background, I'm 21M from the UK, and I've been suffering from anxiety (GAD, panic, health anxiety) for about 6-7 years, but it's been really bad over the past 2. As a result, I've been practically housebound and haven't really had much of a life in that time, although I am in therapy and have made significant progress in the past couple months. 

A couple of weeks ago, I was just watching Netflix before bed, as I usually do, when I had this weird thought of ""huh, my laptop is just a chunk of metal and plastic, so why do I like it"". This seemingly benign thought has spiraled into a series of bizarre and abstract existential questions that have sucked almost all of the joy out of my life. The questions are things like, ""why do I enjoy certain things?"", ""am I wrong to enjoy things?"", ""what's the point in caring about anything?"", ""why do I like things now that I thought were boring as a kid? Should I find them boring now?"". Like I said, very weird, almost nonsensical thoughts and questions. It's gotten to point know where I'm not even really having the thoughts, but I'll try doing something I usually enjoy and I just feel nothing. It's like if I'm watching TV, I can't empathise at all. It all feels so separate. The only thing I feel is a sort of heat or pressure sensation in my head, like my mind is trying really hard to feel something, but just can't. It's almost like fog, or a cloud. 

Right now, I don't know what to do. I keep telling myself to snap out of it, but I just can't. I keep saying it's just depression, but how could depression come out of nowhere as the result of one thought? I'm scared to see a doctor because I don't know what I'd say. I just feel wrong and it's all seemingly because of a conscious thought that I had one night. I'm scared that I've lost the ability to enjoy life now. I'm really confused and feel super low and honestly didn't really know where else to post something like this because, like I said, I'm not even sure what I'm feeling. Depression? Existential crisis? Derealization? 

To clarify, they are just thoughts, not voices and I haven't felt compelled to kill or harm myself, I've just been feeling very low. ",09Jan2019,1

147,"24 year old male, one year out of college. I am in the process of trying to find a governmental accounting job as I feel this is an industry that suits me well. Since I will be relocating most of my interviews are being held over the phone or using recorded videos to answer questions. I’ve been dealing with lots of anxiety associated with these interview processes, which are much longer than I am used to and isn’t exactly normal since I am generally very confident with face to face conversation but by using technology it’s much harder to read people and successfully answer these questions. I get very shaky (my voice and my arm muscles) during and after interviews and am wondering if there are any home remedies I could use to combat this anxiety and nervousness. I haven’t been sleeping well and drinking lots of coffee which I realize isn’t helping but I’m unsure how else to ensure I’m on point during the process. Tips and pointers would be appreciated. I’m doing fine financially and really don’t need a job for at least a couple months but would rather find one asap in order to stay on track with my retirement and saving plans. Any input is welcome, thanks!",09Jan2019,1

149,"Hi. First time writing on here. Just want to state that I am a high schooler and my life isn't really fucked up and I don't think I have any mental problems. And so I've come here to ask a questions I've been asking myself for a while. Let me tell you a bit of the things I do. I constantly overthink and worry about little things. With me I know that if I do anything and the outcome of it is embarrassing I will hate myself for it. For example, I hate ordering food by myself at a fastfood resturant because I sound weak and awkward and so I get angry at myself for not speaking up and just ordering my fucking food. I cannot look at people in the eyes anymore. I personally refuse to look people in the eyes or just look at people in general because Im afraid of judgement and just a certain look and lower my self esteem. Im very insecure so I hardly ever do anything for myself that I should do, If my nose is stuffy and theres tissue in the front of the class I wont go up and blow my nose because I don't like adding attention to myself. My insecurities have built up since middle school, and they've taken a tole on me. I refuse to talk to people I don't know because of fear of them insulting me and making fun of me. I hate myself. I always find some way to pick at who I am. It doesnt even have to be that serious but I take it that way because I'm sensitive . I can't talk to my parents  friends about any of my personal problems because I hate crying infront of others and seeming  weak to other people, I personally feel that I won't be able to form stronger friendships with my friends because I hold myself back. 
Im sorry if this seems like a shitload of things  that aren't making sense. But I want to change for the better so that I dont continue to hate myself and not let myself be free from my insecurities. 
If you happen to read this please give your opinion it would encourage me to think about what I should do. Thanks. ",09Jan2019,1

151," alright. maybe the fact that I’m in a pretty major depression atm isn’t that bad. maybe it’s what I needed to grow up, to change, to finally gain the charming personality I’ve always yearned for. that stupid, annoying, noisy, restless child needs to fucking die. I was getting rid of some stuff on my laptop’s drive and I ran across a bunch of pics featuring 7/8th grade me, and I realized that the reason I’ve been a lonely outcast was the stupid cringy way I behaved (not the fact that my mother was, and still is teaching maths to my class). hopefully, after my depression is over, I will finally act like someone my age, and therefore stop being an annoying 13 year old with ADHD =&gt; have friends!!! gain control over my actions!!! actually know how to communicate with people!!!

just for the background, I'm 17, and I've been told a few times that I need to grow up. sometimes I notice that my behavior just ain't right for someone my age, aka I scream, overreact, keep talking to people even though I see that they aren't interested, say a lot of stupid, cringy shit, and generally do not think before acting.

god I really hope this episode is what was required for me to bloom  
because if this shitty personality doesn't go away I might as well kill myself. I don't want to live with such a personality. ugh gross.

154,"I just moved into a new house with my parents.

I feel like there are small cameras watching me everywhere. I feel that the neighbors next door and up on the hill look into my backyard constantly and are recording and watching, with them thinking I’m doing something wrong even though I’m not. Same with the neighbors across the street who can see my front yard.
I feel like there’s a camera in my LG tv. In my ceiling fan. In the air conditioning vents. In the outlets.

Also, I felt like I was being watched even when I lived elsewhere, too. This isn’t necessarily unique to my moving.
