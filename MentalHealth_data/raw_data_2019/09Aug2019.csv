0,"Before typing this all, I know I should seek help. I don’t need to hear that. I just want answers, explanations things I can’t give myself. I’m not in a position where I can get therapy. 


I think I don’t know who I am. Maybe that’s something that comes with being 15. I feel like it’s worse than others. I feel like I’m literally incapable of becoming my own person. 

For example, I’ve had tons of relationships online (something that helps me cope, I think?) in every relationship, I lied so much. About the way I look, where I’m from, what age I am, what school I go to, every detail about someone’s life that you could know, I’m sure I’ve lied in some way, shape, or form. I don’t think I do it cause I think I’m ugly or, that I think there’s something wrong with me. Even, the weird thing is, when people accept those lies, it makes me feel secure. Maybe to attract people to me more, but that’s all I’ve got. I think I’m going off topic, but the point is, I don’t know how not to lie. I don’t know what the truth really is, I don’t know who I am, or what I really believe.

Of course, know where I live, what my name is, etc. but everything that is supposed to be my person, my character, my thoughts, what I tell people about myself, has always never really been my own for awhile.

I’m honestly not sure what caused this to happen, there’s a lot of factors. There is a lot to explain. If there’s any questions feel free to ask, I have no reason to lie on here, especially since I’m trying to get help.",09Aug2019,2
1,"To make this short, I have really bad anxiety and use to be an extreme(talking full arms and legs cut and burned) self harm-er when I was depressed and got no help. Just went through a year of none of that and it's starting to kick back up again, want to nip this in the bud while i can but need help with finding a psychitrist/therapist.

2,"I have been noticing that I have been having a hard time focusing on anything, I always have to be doing something because I do not feel comfortable sitting still nor can I sit still, I can feel something building up inside of me when I try and sit still and before I know it I am in some form moving around. I can hardly focus on any task before I get distracted and go on my phone or gave off at something happening outside. I’m having trouble holding conversations as when someone starts speaking to me I’ll be paying attention at first but before I realize it I’m lost off in my own thought and I have missed out on over half of what they were saying. How can I bring up these concerns with my doctor in a rational way?",09Aug2019,1
3,"My doctor got me labeled as a drug seeker out of pure incompetence and no psychiatrists will see me because of it. Out of options for meds without seeing a psychiatrist. Therapy isn't helping. Meditation doesn't help. Nobody to talk to. Not like it matters, venting doesn't help either. Can't afford any other types of treatment. What else is left to even try? 7 years of professional ""help"" hasn't helped at all. I've even tried illegal stuff to see if that helps but no cigar. No clue what to do other than just give up.

She says it’s because he texts her too much, but her hatefulness and cruel words seem excessive for actions-texting too much. Additionally, I have seen, read, and heard many people at my school cutting others off, and otherwise acting rude or mean towards others, in hopes that doing so would improve their mental health.

Here are so,s good habits for people with mental health conditions

Choose your friends, wisely, do you really need that friend who lets you down or makes you feel awful and worse about yourself and doesn’t turn up when you want him/her to or has the excuses.

Turning up groups that that’s called mental health support or social club is not good for your mental health, find other places, use the Internet forums, social media 

YouTube and Netflix are your best friends, who needs some mate that doesn’t text you at all, takes away your pride, joy, bank balance and seems to have his or her own way every time. 

Have lots of indoor days, you don’t have worry about getting dressed just grab some comfy clothes, Netflix  and glass of your favourite drink.

Have you got that deadline that’s approaching ? Pop a few bottles of red bull, add on some soothing music, binaural beats or nootropics is your best friend for life.. r/nootropics 

Get too many notifications and feeling overwhelmed, got that annoying person that won’t stop bugging you? Simply turn your mobile on to do not disturb and leave it drawer. Who cares about that Facebook post, mailing list and too many WhatsApp groups?

As most people with mental health conditions prefer an indoor lifestyle, Have lots of hobbies you can do from your comfort of your home ..whether it be knitting, reading, art playing games consoles, anything that keeps yourself occupied and isn’t too taxing is great hobby. 

If you are unable to work due to your illness and don’t know how long it will be before things improve, sign yourself off  jobseekers are you have illness now and you won’t be joining the dole queue. 
If you are in place of work, stay until you have medically can go no more, speak to HR or reduce your hours until things have improved,my can also make the most of annual leave and may find that your able to cope with those demands,

Get diagnosed with depression, anxiety as this will help your corner and will gain access services. 

Depending on the severity scale of your illness,  look what what help is available, self help is very great at the basic level and psychotherapy for every day problems.

And remember mental health conditions are illnesses, please treat them kindly and with respect as if you were having diabetes, they can be lethal and don’t let the problems of daily life dictate the illness or justify your problems by it.

Focus on coping with symptoms and your every day life",09Aug2019,2
7,"My step father moved in when I was five. From that point on I’ve always felt like I wasn’t part of the family. I wasn’t needed. I know that my step father wanted to include me, he always did. We would take trips to museums and zoos, just for me. But I never really felt like part of the family. It wasn’t his fault, it was mine. I was resentful toward him and made the family miserable every chance I could with my poor behavior. I moved out immediately following high school because I wanted out of my strained family. I have remained in contact with them but I still feel like an outsider. I keep them at a comfortable distance.

I was a nerd in school but I had plenty of friends. They never really got to know the real me even though we spent plenty of time together and I considered myself a leader of our group. We did things like role playing games  or played cards but that was it, they were never allowed to know my hopes, dreams and fears. My friends were more like associates.

Because of some circumstances I moved far away from where I grew up and it was quite a culture shock. None of my hobbies are supported here and finding people with like interests is impossible.

I’ve been to clubs and bars. You have probably seen me. I’m the guy sitting alone drinking sodas for hours, watching sports on the TVs, even though the group I came with is having a fantastic time.

I started playing MMOs. I would join groups only to feel like I did not identify with anyone there or feel like I had anything in common with them. I rarely spoke. I never agreed with how things would be run by these other groups so I kept quitting. I eventually started my own group because I knew it would be run the way I wanted it. Things would be more comfortable for me. Perhaps people would want to get to know me then. I ran it for many years and had hundreds of fellow players join me to play. I was quiet most of the time and never really felt like they needed me as they played the game without me. I was just the guy that ran the group.

I’m highly competitive but mediocre at most things I do. In school I was athletic and the first of the nerds to be picked for teams. I play many online games, comparing myself to players with more skill, practice, and know-how. When I perform poorly, I take it to heart, feeling like I’m not part of the group because I’m not meeting the standard.

I got married to a girl that made me feel wanted and needed. We had a baby together and things seemed right until the day I felt she no longer wanted me. We divorced. I got married again to someone I felt like I could share with. Years later, I was divorced again. I was feeling unwanted. I’m on my third marriage now, with another child. I feel like I’m on the outside looking in and they could get along fine without me.

I generally avoid talking to people at work but occasionally they talk to me about uninteresting things. TV shows I don’t watch, sports games I didn’t see and stories about things that happened to them I don’t care about. I have nothing in common with these people. I wish they would leave me alone.

I feel like I have just one friend. I don’t know much about his personal life. We just happen to share a hobby and hang out from time to time.

I’ve looked online about people that feel like an outsider, not wanted and for people that don’t feel like they fit in. Many of the topics seem like it’s geared towards younger people that don’t fit in with school or LGBTQ. I couldn't consider myself the typical social outcast. I’m a straight 40something guy in a collared shirt who is forgone from the days of high school popularity contests. I’m not some confidant lone wolf although people may see me that way, if they see me at all.

I get emotional when I think about what it would feel like to be totally accepted and wanted. I want to be found. On one hand I desperately want to share that bond with someone and on the other hand I keep people at arm’s length and make sure that never happens. When I say I want someone to get to know me, it's not as if I have some great secrets to share. I just want to feel accepted no matter what, have someone that wanted to listen and someone I actually want to listen to. I want to feel needed but I’d feel alone in a room full of good friends.

Even in typing this I feel I’m not fully expressing how I feel. I’m not sure I have the right words to explain this. But I do know it hurts and it's crushing me.

Could someone explain what’s wrong with me and what I need to do to fix myself?",09Aug2019,1
8,"My girlfried has started a diet, and when she described it to me it sounded perfectly healthy. (She has multiple mental health issues such as depression and BPD).

9,"After four years of working at a job that has been the cause of my stress and mental health deterioration, I’ve decided to quit! 
I can’t wait to feel free. To not feel anxious every morning when I go to work. To not feel sick to my stomach. 
I’m not giving two weeks notice. I don’t need my manager as a reference. My supervisor and I are close and she already told me she’d give me one.

10,"Okay this is sort of a rant, I've never really spoke about it and it's affecting me even though it shouldn't and I don't know what to do about it.

This is about 2 and a half years ago around December. I was best friends with this girl and had been for a little while, she had a boyfriend but I liked her. I was partially friends with her boyfriend and I respected the relationship and didn't try anything. Anyway there was a small house party with 6 people and I was meant to be there. My mum wouldn't let me stay out and I feel like if be in a better place if she did. What happened was my best friend who was in a relationship ended up making out with a guy basically. Then once a week for the following 3 weeks she continued to visit him, they didn't go far but they were still carrying on. Fast forward, she's now my girlfriend and even though she wasn't at the time she cheated on her ex, it still really gets to me and I don't know how I feel. We've been going out for 2 years and I don't know how I can clear this up in my head.
She hadn't done anything wrong to me, but it felt and still feels like she has. I know sharing is the first step to clearing it from my mind but how do I make sure it doesn't bring me down or affect my relationship.

TLDR: My girlfriend cheated on her ex and it feels like she did something wrong to me and I can't stop thinking about it.",09Aug2019,1
12,"I keep making the same mistakes over and over and over, and if I don’t break from this cycle and improve myself, I’m going to lose everything that matters to me.

My partner can’t take it anymore: I put things off all the time, I don’t take any actions for our future, and I even struggle to do anything to progress my goals. I just passively go through life hoping everything will turn out well, but I never actually act to ensure the best.

I thought I could get better myself knowing my bad habits, but I haven’t grown.

I need advice, because other than therapy, I have no clue where to start making myself better.  I have so little faith in myself.  I am so hopeless, and I’m so frustrated I keep thinking about just killing myself. I don’t want to, but I can’t stand this hopelessness.",09Aug2019,3
13,"I'm currently going through the motions with the Social Security Administration for my SSI disability case. For a spectrum of physical and mental conditions. Spoke to a lawyer, he mentioned that the court would have a hard time considering my mental conditions as evidence, provided that I intentionally have avoided psychiatric drugs. I have been prescribed dozens of drugs over the last half a decade to treat my other conditions. Sometimes my other conditions were even treated with psychiatric drugs (anti-depressants) which proved ineffective.

So this could very well compromise my disability case. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist after being pushed by literally every one of my doctors. I concede a large portion of my disability is psychiatric in origin. However, I still detest the prospect of taking psychiatric drugs. They will manipulate my brain chemistry long term. And I refuse to believe anyone who tells me they will not. Yes, my brain chemistry is already fucked up, also, yes, I have tried pretty much everything else. It still scares me.",09Aug2019,1

A lot of time at night I put on earbuds with music and just walk around my house. Just really odd stuff like that.

18,"I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 for at least 8 months now, and thankfully seroquel has alleviated a lot of the symptoms.

I was recently diagnoised with ADHD too, but I can't take medication for it because it interferes with my Bipolar disorder.

I feel like I'm losing my mind or something is breaking within me. I don't know what's happening.

I'm really worried that as time passes it'll all just get worse and I'll be seriously disabled. 

Is this to be expected with mental illnesses? Is it normal to have multiple? Is anyone in a similar position?

19,"First off, if you can, do it before reading this so maybe you'll get the same stress-relieving effect I have at this precise moment.

 These past two weeks have been extremely turbulent, to say the least. Mental and emotional whirlwinds on end. So I set out to start with a clean slate. I didn't know where to start nor how I was going to get my stuff back together again. Then I remembered than in order to build competence and achieve mental mastery you need to start from little steps, simple disciplines, give yourself slight edges. In other words, you can't fix the world if you can't fix yourself first and one of the things that will set the tone for your turnaround will be cleaning up your chaotic enviroment. It comes as no surprise your go-to space you will have to start with first is no other than your personal space, be it a room or any space you give room to belongings and things that are somewhat meaningful to you.

 Once you set your mind to do it, now it's time to see ways by which you will detox or cleanse from things that might cause a mental or emotional attachment and are a burden to your psyche. This is a key factor that comes into play to do this succesfully and let the whole thing come to fruition. This is NOT only about rearranging your stuff, but rather, is all about causing a mental impact by rearranging and ridding yourself of things to set a new enviroment. So it's of utmost importance to do this correctly.

 If you're struggling with mental clutter, chances are your personal space is filled with it too. One of the best ways to do away with it and prevent it from pile up over time is to adapt a somewhat minimalist approach when doing up your room. Let's be real here, what makes you think you'll need your 3rd grade math notes again? most likely, you won't need them again neither over the short nor the long run. The point here is to keep and leave the items or things you truly use on a regular basis, things you would need in a specific possible scenario (notes, receipts and so on) and things that make you light up and really look forward to the future, not things that make you overthink, ruminate or dwell on the past. For the purpose of this post, I will not go into detail, but you get the point.

 That's it for now. It went a long way for me and now I can really move on and build up again. It Has been a massive game-changer. It gave me a mental state to start getting my life back in order again in spite of and in midst of the turbulences. You will pull through, my friend. Start with little steps, simple disciplines. Trust me, it works.",09Aug2019,2

22,"Amazing culture, great co-workers, etc. But I'm anxious and depressed -- for probably a lot of reasons (including significant life changes, like an upcoming move to a new state), and I'm planning on going back to therapy ASAP as soon as I get to my new city in September.

This organization distributes leadership very well which I love but I often get confused about structure and roles. My co-workers are all about the same age as I (mid-20s) and we're all pretty jokey around the office, so I do think I have a hard time taking negative feedback from supervisors who I also wish to be my friends. I don't have a lot of fulfilling friendships outside of work anymore to fill that need for me so I think I tend to be a little codependent on people who I really should keep a better emotional distance from (another thing I plan on working on).

I find my motivation to do well in this job to have been dwindling significantly over the last year or so and my performance has been suffering, which creates an endless loop of demotivation and lack of interest in growing as a professional, something I've usually felt very motivated to do. Usually, I think I'm a pretty competent person and I'm still really interested in the field, but something about this ""perfect"" job makes me feel like a total loser. I have been told I'm not being ""productive enough"" and it's a ""time management issue"" when I'm really just getting burned out on life big time and no article on Gmail optimization is going to fix that. I am leaving at the end of this month to follow my partner as he starts a new job in a new state where I don't have a job yet, so I have an out -- but I'm anxious about bringing this negative self-perception of, ""why couldn't I succeed in a job that was so great?"" with me on my job hunt.

Anyway, no specific requests or anything. Just wanted to put that out there in case someone else has been or is currently in the same place, and could use validation that they aren't alone.",09Aug2019,1
23,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a good day today and if you aren’t I hope you will in the future. So I have been suffering with social anxiety , general anxiety and depression for 6 years now. I’m at a point in my life where I’ve hit rock bottom, I’m not trying to go past rock bottom, because things can always get worse I know that for a fact. I want to go up from here, I need to go up from here or else I’m fucked. 
 

Anyways, I feel like I can write a book about trying to find the “one”, the right medication. I know it’s out there waiting for me, I think, hopefully. Most people can probably relate to this, I’ve tried over 12-16 different medications. I’m also a big wussy and sometimes can’t handle the side effects of specific medications, I truly feel like I’m going to die when I take medication. The longest I usually stay on med is 2 weeks to a month, longest being 2 months so I know that I can stay on a med if I really try but what is the point if side effects become unbearable. I also understand you need your body to adjust, takes time, things get a lot worse before they get better. I understand that aspect completely. 
 However, I’m so freaking frustrated because us that are suffering with a mental illness have to suffer even more, when starting a new medication and the catch is that I might not even work!! It’s the so called “trail and error right”, but I’m just starting to lose hope on this journey. The side effects can be truly awful and most people discontinue medication because it becomes unbearable. I’m currently taking Nardil and I’m on my 6th day after failed trails of SSRI’s and SNRI’s. I feel like complete crap taking Nardil and I’ve heard from personal experiences that it took some people 2-3 months of awful side effects to barely start feeling relief. For some people this was their last chance after several failed trails with other medications and it didn’t help them. Im so desperate on trying to find a medication that will help, not become my magic pill but just help me enough to function as normal human being in society. 
 
The way I see it is medications do work for people, not for all people obviously. Our brains are complex therefore everyone has differences in brain chemistry. There many different classes of medications that target different receptors in the brain right. One medication might work for one person, but not for the other. The problem I have is we take a medication for 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months sometimes even 4-6 months and some people have to deal with the horrible side effects, it really affects our lives to the point where we are barely functioning hoping that it will work one day. Some people find success, while some don’t and the people that didn't had to endure the side effects while also still being extremely anxious or depressed, it sucks. I know that we are willing to go through the side effects knowing that there is a chance that it could work for us right? But isn’t it so frustrating when it doesn’t work and it’s on to the next medication. What are we supposed to do when we run out of options, I keep trying the same medications hoping the outcome will be different and it’s soul shattering to me and I just want to give up when it doesn’t work. What are your thoughts on this issue, should I look at this from a different perspective? Am I just being negative because I just can’t find the “one”. Would love to know how you guys feel about this issue!!",09Aug2019,1
24,"So I was finally able to see her! It was a mixed bag of emotions for the hour I was able to be there. She was so excited that I was actually coming, she ran to the shower and put on the nice clothes she had. Seeing her was a breathe of life I definitely needed. We hugged, we cried, we kissed (until we were told to stop by the nursing staff), and we joked and laughed like nothing had changed. 

It was an amazing 15-20 minutes. Then, her questions started coming up. When will she be home, why does she have to take the meds, how can she say whatever is needed to be said to appease the psychiatric so she can fool him into releasing her. As the questions kept coming, the more agitated she became. Started with less smiles and joking to combative and sweating, twitching, etc. She wanted to know why I wasn't demanding her release since she was fine. At the end of the hour she got so worked up, she walked up to the nurse and demanded her night medicine (which she would spit out as of yesterday). We kissed one last time and she went to sleep.

It was sad how it ended, but completely worth it selfishly for myself. I loved seeing her, agitated or not. I loved holding her and the smell of her skin was the same as I remember it. She looked so beautiful.

The doctor did say he thinks it's postpartum psychosis. And after reading up on the symptoms and signs, it seems logical. Hopefully the psychologist is on to something and we can get a treatment plan going. I'll be passing out as soon as I post this. The grandparents took both the kids for the night,  so I'm going to take full advantage of a quiet house.

31,"Throwawy for obvious reasons and sorry for long post I have alot on my heart. I have a weird fethis and that is dying by liver/oran failure generally anything that injure me turn me on. I also get turned on by dying in medical seting. When I was 15 I started to imagine myself getting liver failure or organ failure and strangely getting turned on by it. This is important for later, but this fethis was just a phase.  This is extremly weird I know, but I have always known there is something very wrong with me. I have aspergers, but i think i have some underlying mental condition. I Love being being wreckless, I set fire to stuff and get into huge fist fights outnumbered often losing. I am 19 and estimate I have been in 40+ fights. I have even been stabbed with a bottle once. I feel euphoric when i do it. Often after fist fights I masturbate because of the pure euphoria. I feel mentally very ill at times because I get sexually turned on by the weirdest stuff. Since May 2018 I have ran oral steroids which I bough from my drug dealer and bying them from the internett. The reason for running them was because I wanted to get big and muscular, because I have serious body image issues also i binge eat alot so i didnt wanna get fat, the binge eating would make me big. I started to run ran 50mg dianabol everyday. After 5 months i started to feel sick every morning and i puked alot of my food up. I reckoned this was my liver acting up, but the fucked up thing is when i recognized this the memories from being fifteen started to come back and lets say i Felt turned on all the time.

 I ran the Dianabol for 1 month more before I stopped it. I later went on a 2 month drug binge where I did alot pills and cocaine. In december I decided to run Trenavar at 120mg stacked with epistane 50mg every day. For the sole intention of getting big for attention, and to try and kill myself with liver failure because at this point i am very depressed and I just wanna die. I drank alot of alcohol when i was running this stack mainly because i wanted to escape and to kill myself. I drank maybe a six pack 3 times a week. After about 2 months of abusing my body for no reason other than getting turned on I started to abuse OTC codein which has paracetamol in it. This is where it became to much for me. After a 8 day binge i started to get pain in my liver. I could actually feel my liver when walking and working out. I started to feel dizzy. I stopped drinking and halfed my steroid dose. I Started to feel better after about 1 weeks and i kept running my stack. 

Then one fatefull saturday i was invited to a party, I never get invited to parties, because everyone deems me weird. I had to go. When I was at the party I drank extremly heavly over 0.5 liters of vodka and snorted alot of cocaine. The next morning i had pain where my kidnes where and when i peed the pee was black. I was in dire pain . I started to regret what i had done with my body. I had pain in my kidnes and a weird tingling sensastion in my stomach for 2 weeks. I Wanted to kill myself in this time period but i couldn't go through with it. I still felt turned on by damaging my liver and organs, but i was still extremly worried that i might have permantly injured myself so i stopped all alcohol and steroids. I waited intuil july 2019 when i went back on trendione at 90mg everyday. I Did this because I didnt want to loose my size.  It went only 6 days before i started to shit blood. and after 10 days i had dire pain in my liver. I stopped everything. Its august now and i am starting my apprentice job soon, but i feel like i have a foot in the grave. I have serious pain in my liver and my stomach is bloated. I have indigisten and i itch everywhere, but i get turned on by this knowning that i am in dire shit. I wonder what is wrong with me why i keep killingmyself and why i cant get turned on by women or men, but by objects and injuring myself. I also cut myself. I am scared of going to the doctors because then i have to admit what i have done and they will know that i am a drug abuser. 

Can someone also talk to me. I am very lonley at the moment. I am also in alot of pain",09Aug2019,5
32,"I just found out earlier tonight from his mom that one of my close friends has been put in a mental health facility for severe depression, and I’m planning to visit him tomorrow during one of the two daily visiting times, with the only rules I know about being I can’t bring anything in with me and I need an adult to go along (my mom’s coming). I want to try to help him feel a bit better, especially since he chose me as someone he was ok with knowing about this and I have no idea how long he’s been in there, but I don’t want to mess anything up or make things worse by saying or doing something wrong. I already have a few things planned out that I think will cheer him up a bit (I’m wearing a shirt he gave me for my birthday a couple years ago and I’ll tell him something funny I found that he’d like that I think he missed because he was probably in there when I sent it to him), but other than those two things I’m not sure what I’ll say or do. So if there’s anything specific I can do to brighten him up or anything I should avoid that could make him feel worse, please tell me down below. I want to help him as much as I can with what little time and ability I have here.",09Aug2019,3
33,"I feel like I have zero ability to regulate my emotions properly. Sometimes I feel so strongly about things but then I wonder if I’m delusional.

If I feel hurt (which is often), it’s all consuming. Taking me out of my environment, and pushing me deep into my mental space. Here, I’m forced to reevaluate myself, the way I acted, and the way I’ve presented myself. I feel so lost in my head from the constant self-assessment that I wonder if everything I think I’ve done, in reality has come across differently.

The smallest thing sends me into the emotional abyss, and I’m completely exhausted. I don’t yell or scream or cry to anyone (but inside I am), I just sit deep in this mental space, displaced from the people and world around me. 

I also feel like these overloaded emotions have built conspiracies within me. Towards my family, towards my friends. I KNOW people care about me, but I FEEL hurt by those same people.

I feel like I have no emotional control. And I latch on the the solution of killing myself (though it’s more romantic than serious). 

I just don’t know how to get out of my head. And how to stop being consumed by my sensitivities. I’ve tried mindfulness, meditation, changes in behavior, in thought, in approach towards others. I think I may have a processing issue, because this doesn’t seem normal at my age. And I’m sick of hurting others and myself because of it.

Today a comment my coworker made about me was burned into my brain. I replayed it 10,000 times, allowing it to challenge the beliefs I hold about myself. All fucking day I thought about it, till I got home and thought about it more. I felt so emotionally overwhelmed, destructive thoughts started to rise. I realized ”I don’t know how to get rid of this.” As I sat there feeling paralyzed, the only way I could think of was to drink (which I didn’t do), but I realized I had no healthy alternative.

This happens probably 3 or 4 times a week, where I’m just emotionally destroyed. And by stupid shit, it makes me wonder if I’m just delusional.

Today..eventually the feelings subsided. But here I am, trying to fall asleep, thinking about it again, spiraling. It just seems like my emotional response is so much larger than the reality of the situation. But I don’t know how to stop it, it’s been this way for so long.

Anyone have any ideas? I’ve tried so much mindfulness oriented exercises and habits. I’m feeling a bit lost.",09Aug2019,4
34,"sorry in advance if this is poorly put together, im writing all of this on impulse because i really would like some sort of guidance i guess. this is the best i can do.

i dont feel right, last year i went through some pretty traumatic stuff with my family (we lost our house and had to move in with a relative who soon after passed away) and i havent really felt the same since,

i dont feel like i can trust anything, like im constantly in a state of fight or flight even if i know that's stupid. when people are kind to me i feel like it's all fake, and despite how much love im shown by people, i still feel like im going to lose it all any day now. i dont feel like leaving my bed or eating- actually i get so nervous when i eat that sometimes i throw up. im always so tired but i can never sleep because my mind starts wandering into bad thoughts, and when i do sleep its either not for very long or its not good sleep, so i mostly just pass out during the day.

sometimes i do really good, especially when i talk to or about my significant other, but most of the time i just feel scared and alone, even when im with my family and were all having a good time together, its like a lingering feeling of dread is right behind me constantly.

my s/o is very caring and always goes the extra mile for me, but thinking about them makes me so anxious and nervous because im so scared that they feel some kind of obligation to be around me or something, i love them so much and im so afraid of losing them that sometimes i throw up just at the thought of them.

ive always struggled with separation anxiety and i've already kind of talked to my parents about this, im going to be seeing a councilor at the end of the month, but my dad says this is all normal and is a result of my age.. so i really just want to know if this /is/ normal. is this something that im gonna get over in time or is this something serious? i dont want to commit suicide or anything but i dont think this is a proper way for a person to function..

i know this isnt the best place for medical help or whatever, like i said im getting help soon enough, i just need some advice or some positive words or something, ive vented to people about this in my personal life but i feel like im just annoying them when i do it. im too embarrassed to approach anyone else in my life with it.",09Aug2019,1

38,"Not sure if anyone can relate this but pretty much- about 6-7 years ago (I’m 21 now) i was very depressed. At the time i didn’t notice but i was in my room watching vampire diaries from 1pm (time i would wake up) up until 5 or 6 in the morning. I had blackout curtains and would pretty much ensure i was surrounded by darkeness and i would only leave my room to use the restroom and get food and water.  

What’s interesting to me is that my parents noticed this and were worried about me and would constantly check on me in my room however i never understood the issue. And in a weird way, i knew i had just started doing this behavior but strangely enough, during this, i couldn’t even remember what i would do normally with my family and others before that period. So that’s really weird to think about.

On top of that, the past 6 years have been non-stop stress, my life has been chaotic and it's difficult to get back on track without making decisions that are painful. A lot of this has to do with being poor, a ton of debt, an older ex who encouraged said debt in my name and my wanting to go back to Europe to start fresh. Oh and custody.

I've learned to center myself sometimes, to be mindful the painful emotions that go through me actually go away, and that I'm not trapped in them forever. It took a while to figure that and I'm proud that I've made that leap. It's a battle I deal with multiple times a day, and it's hard I'm very tired.

My issue is the state of my life, it feeds my turmoil. 

A lot of people I've attracted in my life have chaotic lives as well, so I keep to myself mostly. I do have plans to make more friends but id like to first get back on track.

I noticed in the past year or so I have to put a lot of effort in remembering things in relation to people. If it's work related, ill remember.

49,"I'm a junior in high school and I've recently been a lot sadder then usual. I've never used the word depressed to describe how I felt before but I feel it's more appropriate now. Quick context: today I had an ""episode"". I was in the shower and I just started worrying about my future what I was going to or where I was going to go. I thought about my friends moving on without me and things like that. It gotten to the point where I was on and off crying in the shower and pacing around outside it afterwords doing the same. After all that I threw up. To be fair I have been sickly lately so it could just be that. I've never gotten this bad before and I think what set it off is something to do with this girl I like. I met her in 8th grade but only occasionally talked in p.e I didn't like her until late freshman year afyer we had an elective together where we would do lots of little group projects in pair of 4. It was me her her best friend and a newer friend of mine. I was happier then I thought and I took it for granted. Sophomore year I didn't get any classes with her and It kinda messed with my head because I really started to like and build her up in my head. I didn't know how to approach her since we didn't have any classes and im kinda not the greatest with girls anyway so I never eneded up talking to her. I still feel the same way about her even now but having started my junior year I didn't get any classes with her again. We don't even have the same lunch. This made me really bummed as I was looking foward to just one class with her even just to be around her would satisfy. Anyway now I'm thinkg of her moving on with everyone else and me being stuck with nothing. I have no idea what im gonna do when I'm an adult and it scares me a lot now. I'm scared of being alone. How do people cope with these feelings because right now I'm just so confused and sad. I want to be happy and maybe I should just forget about this girl but my heart seems to just hold on. I've thought about just telling her but I don't wanna be creepy and rush into it. Which is why i just wanna be friends and get to know her better.

I am currently stucked. I don't have any idea on what to do with my life. I am in constant boredom and I think I'm lonely.

I tried pursuing many hobbies, unfortunately, they're all just temporary source of happiness and excitement. Living in a third world country does not really give you a lot of options.

All I do every day of my life is wake up, go to my college, go home, rinse and repeat. I feel like i'm in a rat race with no sense of escape and freedom, clawing for something that I can't seem to determine or find. It's difficult to put in words.

There's also a pretty high chance that I have a condition called Horton's cephalalgia / cluster headaches also affectionally called ""suicide headaches"". Being in constant pain does not really yield any favors. It's torture.

Maybe that's just life. We all have these hurdles and obstacles to overcome and I hope I can press on.

54,"Ok so I can’t sleep and just have a lot of thoughts going through my mind.
A lil intro, I’m 27 - about to turn 28, I’m a mom, and the only parent actively in my daughters life, and I have a long list of mental illnesses.
Basically I had a shitty ass childhood and didn’t even realize how bad it was until I became an “adult” and discovered that what I thought was normal was NOT how anyone I knew was raised, it’s cool though, because now that I’m a mom I use it as an example of how not to be and what not to do so my daughter doesn’t turn out a wreck like me.
Anyways, my mental illnesses “kicked in” so to speak at around age 12, and I spent a lot of my youth (teenage years) with the thought of not sticking around too long. I planned to kill myself by 18. So, since I was dead set on that being the case I never cared to learn how to have a life as an adult, or how to manage a job and money and credit and all that shit, I never thought I’d be around long enough to worry about it all. WELL, I screwed myself, because about 3 suicide attempts later I’m still here, and I’m grateful most of the time, because my daughter is here now, and she’s a gift to this world, I know all parents think that but my kid, she’s pure magic. I don’t even deserve her, I have no idea how something so good could have come from me. She’s celestial.
But now, I’m stuck trying to pick up all these pieces of my life, and be an adult, and I’m drowningggg. My credit is wrecked thanks to my daughters dad who put everything in my name when we were together and then fucked me when he took off with some tinder girl and had another kid, so now I’m struggling to pay rent, bills are stacking, I’m trying to raise a little girl on my own, and I’m losing my mind most days.
It’s been rough for a little over a year, and it’s been really messing with my mental health, and I spend a lot of time thinking “I should be dead” 
On top of that I’m an idiot and I give too much love to people who soak it up until they feel good enough about themselves to run off to someone better. After my daughters dad left, I had a string of heartbreak, which ended with me making me New Years resolution to stay single all of 2019. 
Then towards the end of January I met someone and I don’t really know how to explain it but he immediately felt safe to me, like .. safe as in I felt like I could give him my love and he wouldn’t run off with it like the rest did. So I broke my resolution on January 29th and started dating this man that waltzed in and scooped my heart up with both hands, and held it safe. 
We’ve been together for 6 months now and it’s been up and down, and I blame so much of our “problems” on myself, because I don’t know how to accept love, and I don’t feel like I deserve it. And I’m paranoid that I’m going to be hurt again.
He’s never given me any REAL reason to doubt him. He’s given me so much love, he made me feel beautiful for the first time in my life, he made me believe that I have a future ahead that is worth living for. But I’m stuck because my mental health is trash, and my burdens are heavy, and if I run off this miracle of a man by being a basket case it’ll be the end of me. 
He is home.
My heart finally feels at home with him.
Like I can’t describe the love I have for him, there’s no words. The way he loves me, the way he loves my daughter, his soul, it’s incredible. I’m always in awe of him.
I just wish I knew a way to keep the bad things from creeping into my mind and ruining my sight of life.  
I’m trying to climb out of the hole that is my depression and anxiety and stress and etc.
I’m trying to build my credit, pay my debts, fix my life, be a good mom, be a good partner, it’s just all so overwhelming sometimes.

Ever since then, it’s been slowly melting my fucking brain. Just in this past week alone (I’ve had a few friendship fallouts since last week- I’m wondering if that’s triggering all this), it’s been causing me to have extremely vivid and disturbing dreams that cause me to wake up anxious and frightened. This is also a problem because I have a really hard time falling asleep. As soon as I try, I begin having heart palpitations and my ears start ringing. All the things that worry/scare me start running through my mind. I have been so on edge for the past two years that I’m just exhausted and feel like I can’t do it anymore. I feel like I’m constantly having to tiptoe around things that could possibly trigger a panic attack and it’s making me unable to truly live. About a month and a half ago, I was in the psych ward in the hospital because I had cut myself (not related to my anxiety). I was held for a week and that stay honestly seemed to make things worse which makes me feel even worse because I thought my stay there would at least help my mental health. I have convinced myself multiple times I am schizophrenic although I present no symptoms of it and have never had a psychiatrist suggest that I may be, I’ve convinced myself I have cancer, that everyone in my life hates me, all that. I also in the past two years have developed this nauseating fear of death. I’m not sure where that came from as I’ve never looked at death as scary, but it’s just this crippling fear that I can’t shake. I currently don’t qualify for Medicaid and I can’t afford insurance at the moment (the ultimate catch 22) or I would immediately start going to therapy.

I recently spoke back to a member of staff in my school. I criticized her for ordering me and a couple of other students to leave an area without a reason. I just hate it when adults order people around with no actual reason behind it, especially when they use an overpowering or condescending tone. I'm only 19 but I feel like respectband reason should always be given between to parties, no matter the age gap.
Not long after this I was threatened with suspension should it happen again. The teacher who said they would suspend me told me I should 'pick my battles' more carefully, stating that the last one wasn't 'worth it'.

I’ve had this since I was in pre-school (since I was around 4 years old or so)

I have seen multiple psychologists, and they seem to be stumped on what this may be, or even how to “treat” it. When they do attempt to “treat” it I become 10x worse, everything goes down hill. 

When I try to ignore the feeling it gets worse, in fact i was invited out by a friend at the time’s party, (this was 3 or so years ago) I just shut down and didn’t go, as a result I slept for ~23 hours a day for 2 months, before I was made to go into a mental hospital, they didn’t know what to make of it either. As you’d expect, this “problem” really bothers me. 

I have searched everywhere on the internet for an answer as to what this may be, I have a hunch it may be a cluster A personality disorder, mainly schizoid or schizotypal, but even those seem like a stretch. 

It’s not social anxiety, I don’t care what people think of me and I don’t care about being embarrassed in any way. I have been anxious over other things and it feels VERY different.

I took the test last night and scored 14 out of 40 though, so like, probably not. But I feel self-involved? I have some executive function issues, forgetfulness, and not being very good at making use of free time, like, I panic when I have it, and either try to do everything, or just lose all my time and do nothing. Used to get this weird thing in late childhood where it was like I just suddenly realised I was /me/, and was surprised to be myself, living my life. Like there was an alternative? But that doesn’t happen anymore. Child of divorce. Been bullied at school and uni. As a kid I had a series of nervous ticks and twitches, and I still feel the need to spit if I smell something awful, which I think started because of gross living conditions in my early twenties when my Mum was depressed. Two loved ones have threatened suicide to me, one implicitly, one verbally. I lived with a very verbally abusive younger sibling for about eight years (he was bigger than me for the last few years), and my Dad (not biological), would hit me sometimes. Not beat me, but lose his temper if we were fighting or he got the wrong idea and /thwack/. Apparently he’d hit my face when I was very young if I was making a particular defiant chin-in-the-air face. We don’t talk anymore. I doubt the validity of what I’ve been through a bit, like, oh, your little brother, not real abuse, doesn’t count, oh, you were sexually assaulted but not with a dick, is that really that traumatic? It’s been six years, why am I still randomly thinking about beating him up? Why this? 

I definitely have anxiety. A habit of imagining shitty hypotheticals and getting really upset or angry about them. Have had suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. Never attempted. I’m a bit naturally codependent and not great with boundaries, like, find it hard to give my partners space if I need reassurance, or hard not to talk if there’s something pressing on my mind. I’m getting better with practice. Relationshipping is hard, asserting boundaries is also often hard. I /really/ need people to be gentle and kind when they criticise me. I’m pretty insecure, I guess, and worry a lot that I’m boring, don’t have enough to say or contribute. When I’m with someone else, I tend to unconsciously just let them navigate, steer the direction we’re walking. I’m very affectionate, but sometimes have a hard time saying I miss you. Sometimes worry I’m incapable of love or don’t really love people. When I’m really upset, sometimes I go away, really hoping the other person will come after me. I’m female, 30, bisexual. Have seen a few psychs, tend to get the “we want to treat /symptoms/“ approach. 

I’ve wondered about every condition under the sun. One of my partners thinks I have complex ptsd, and has said something about vigilance. Thanks to anyone who read this long post, any insight would be super appreciated.",09Aug2019,2

She basically told me that I needed to move on. I understand that bad things happened to me a long time ago and I'm not in that situation anymore but distance doesn't undo years of mental and physical abuse. I've never really worked through those feelings because I don't want it to seem like I wan't attention so I usually keep things to myself.

69,"Hi,

I'd like to ask for advice in the following situation, what do you think is the best course of action?

My grandmother (89) is suffering from dementia which is getting even worse since May. In the beginning she just didn't remember small things or couldn't learn anything new, but in May she suddenly changed. She used to live abroad for 40 years but moved back to my home country to be closer to her children, grandchildren. Because she didn't have experience how things work now she willingly left her finances, insurance, pension, housing stuff to her children to deal with. She even signed documents to authorise access for them for all of the above.

All was good until recently when she suddenly developed paranoia and started to blame my mother stealing her money. Then came that somebody (she doesn't say it, but hints her children/my mum) is spying on her computer and her phone.

The problem lies she doesn't understand how modern things work and now everything she doesn't recognize means it's against her. She doesn't listen to reasoning, she says all the time she is not stupid, etc. So no matter what anybody says she ignores it and becomes hysterical from time to time about small things.

I used to help her with the computer and the phone but now she gets scared of every pop-up and questions the computer asks. When I try to help her, explain what it is, why it happened, she doesn't even listen and just repeats herself about being spied and how my Mum is stealing her money.

The situation got so bad the family started to ignore her calls, cause it lead nowhere and she always got hysterical in the phone (or even in person) about the same things crying and feeling betrayed. It drained everybody mentally to listen daily this. Our thought was if we don't give her chance to speak about these things, she won't anger herself. Later she stopped calling most of us. However my Mum still visits her every couple off days to do the groceries, have a lunch together but if my Grandma starts her blame-game she leaves immediately, won't argue. According to my Mum, she is normal a week than next week is crazy again. Grandma calls me sometime but I let it go to voicemail, because I know she doesn't have any serious problem on her computer and I just don't wan't listen to her complains for hours.

But I know (and Grandma mentioned it unintentionally), she feels very-very lonely now everybody tries to minimise the contact with her. She always loved her whole family with her full heart and still does (despite what she thinks we might do) but now she is confused and feels lost why everybody is acting as they do. She won't admit she has a mental problem, doesn't wan't to see a doctor, so we can't do anything about it. But it's painful for her (and for us as well) for her last years to feel like that.

I had the idea to call her on weekends so she doesn't feel disconnected (from me, at least). But now she is angry at us that she just says all is good in an offended voice and hangs up.

We accepted her condition and we know it only gets worse. We know she's never going to be that person she was like even a year ago. It just hurts everyone to turn our back to protect ourselves (and herself) from those breakouts.

I turn to you to for advice. How can I (my family) mitigate her pains but somehow avoid her meltdowns? We don't want our Grandma/Mother to feel lonely in her remaining years (which can be still quite a few as she doesn't have any other physical problems).

Thanks for reading my lengthy problem.",09Aug2019,1
70,"Hello,

So my mother currently has a difficult time with chemotherapy. There have been some complications lately and the doctor was really impolite/harsh/neglecting and unprofessional which leaded to a lot of stress. Additionally, my my grandparents became super controlling lately and blamed my dad for lots of things. He on the other hand went on a small vacation alone last week. Because of all that unjustified blame and lots of stress, a big fight between my parents happened. My mother didn't sleep for a night and had already too few sleep because of medicaments.

So now it happened, she acted strangely and since yesterday is completely schizophrenic. She writes texts, spreads out paper all over the kitchen with strange notes on them. She ran around the neighbourhood at 4 in the night and is aggressive.

Her diagnosis was manic-depressive. Last time, we called an ambulance, but she played that everything was fine. We finally got her into a hospital, but it was really cruel there and after a week she was allowed to go. After half a year, she went from schizophrenic to depressive and we got her to go to a therapist, who finally was able to put her on medication.

She doesn't want to take meds or go to the therapist. We don't want to put her into hospital. I'm not home yet, but don't know what to do when I'm there. She has the next chemotherapy in 10 days and it would be terrible, if she now stops going there. Additionally, she needs to take meds every day because of high blood pressure and other chemo related problems and I don't think, she is taking them currently.

So, I don't know what to do, when I'm home. I hope to talk to her, listen and suggest her to take some medication. Though, I don't even know what medication.",09Aug2019,1

72,"So I am really young(just turned 14) and I have been dealing with social anxiety for the past 3 years or so, the first 2 years weren't that bad but I didn't like eating with other people or do stuff like that, I would be able to do it, but I wouldn't like doing it.
This winter it started getting worse and I had panic attacks pretty much every day in school, resulting in me having to go home after about an hour of being at school every day.
After a couple weeks of this mess I just decided to stay home for a couple weeks, around this time I would not want to go anywhere or do anything except sleep or watch Netflix.
I also got some sort of calming medicine, not sure exactly what is was called, but I believe it was from some plant or something.
This is around where my family started to think that I probably have depression.
I then got home schooled until the end of school and start of summer break.
Somewhere in april i got sertraline from my doctors, I think mostly for my social anxiety but a bit for my depression as well, they said I was probably gonna feel worse the first couple weeks, and sure enough I felt like absolute shit for a while. I take these once every day.
About 3 months or so later, in July, I had my first suicide thoughts and it was honestly the scariest thing I've ever been through.
If I wasn't too tired then I probably would have killed myself then and there.
When I told my parents and they talked with my doctors about this I got some pills that I am supposed to take when I'm feeling bad, don't know the name but they just make you really tired and they make your mouth dry.
The problem I have with this is that when I'm feeling suicidal I probably won't have time to take this pill and then wait however long it takes for it to kick in.
I honestly just feel like it would be smarter to actually prevent it from happening rather then trying to stop it when its happening.
I also go to therapy for my social anxiety but not for my depression, like how is me being able to go to school more important then me being alive?
I might be completely wrong but I would just rather focus on the thing that might kill me rather then the thing that prevents me from going to school etc.

I've been in a long-distance relationship with someone I met in a video game for 2.5 years now. We've both met up multiple times, been physically intimate etc, it's all great when it's great.

Since we first met, we'd always do stuff in the video game we met in together. It became highly intimate for me, especially given being LDR other intimacy can be lacking at times. It became normal and I loved it.

But around three months ago, he decided to push me aside so he could go and do this stuff with other people. I'm not blind to the fact that these other people offered the gameplay experience he desired but it left me feeling highly rejected and broken since. It was made worse because he insisted originally that I'd be able to follow him to the group but when it turned out he was mistaken, he refused to rethink or fix anything and told me to basically just deal with it. Which I have been for months now.

Tonight he's likely going to hit a milestone with his new group and for the first time since we met 3.5 years ago (even before we started dating), I'm going to see him succeed without me.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to be upset, I don't want to care - but I know it's going to make me crash. And when I do, all that'll happen is he'll tell me we should breakup. Again. Because any time I ask for something that means he'd lose out, no matter how minor or major, he refuses and tells me to just accept it.

I keep overthinking little things. I feel so lost. Basically, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. But my friend told me you're not depressed you're just sad.

79,"It is so often talked about that we are supposed to work. We are supposed to have a wife (husband), kids, a house, the like. We are supposed to get enough money to make those people happy. We are SUPPOSED to come to work on time. Supposed to wake up. Supposed to be happy with this life. What if, we dont WANT to anymore. what if it is just too damn hard when all we really want to do is to make an impact on the world.

I am just one person. I have been told that I need to stick to something my whole life. But if today I want to stream, tomorrow i want to paint, and the next day i want to write poetry, why not do all three? Because it isn't how it's SUPPOSED to be. I need to stick to a career that I can grow and eventually, maybe, make enough money to have a family or to make the difference I long to make...

But where does happiness come into play? What day do I get to wake up and say, ""This is the life I want."" Part of me believes that this day will never come. That noone lives the life they want until they die... because maybe that is the life we want: a lackthereof.

As of right now, I am trying to make a difference by talking to people and showing them that you can make momentary happiness each day and showing that it will get better than the crippling anxiety attacks that keep you in your bed. I am TRYING to show that my antidepressants really HAVE made a difference... which they have. But I still don't know if I will ever hit that goal I am trying to reach.

I hope that somehow, I can become a streamer that focuses on mental health and making a difference... but I don't think it will ever take off and ill be on a new dream in a couple weeks... but at least these dreams keep me fighting and as long as i am fighting, I will stay alive.",09Aug2019,2

Hey guys,

Looking for advice from the world; this is my first time ever posting anything like this, so... here it goes.

My girlfriend(24) and I(23) have been together for a year and three months. Three and a half months ago, we moved in together. Everything seemed so perfect. Prior to this, I had been living near Portland, and she was two hours away near the army base in WA. She's currently enlisted. Every weekend, we would take turns driving to see each other- we'd spend every weekend together, including a week for Christmas break, and it was wonderful. Initially, when we first started dating- within the first month or two, I broke up with her. Why? Because she was being a complete dick. She wasn't talking to me, wouldn't respond to texts, would call me names; when I'd call her she wouldn't even support me. I was over it. So I left. I guess my first red flag should have been her showing up on my patio at 8am the day after I broke up with her, uninvited. She was just sitting there. So, I had a fucking panic attack, opened the door, calmed down, and we talked things out. I gave her another chance, obviously.

Everything is going great after that point. She promises to go and talk to some one about her anger and starts to treat me so much better. It was like a complete 360. So, after a year, I quit my job, say bye to my friends, break my lease, and move up to WA to be with her. She stops going to counseling. Everything seems fine, so, I don't let that bother me. Moving in is great- we're super compatible, she's not controlling or jealous, we hang out and go mountain biking, go to the gym, hang out with friends...etc. Normal stuff.

And then, a month ago, I go to visit family in OR. I come home and she (having been on leave for a pre-deployment that she didn't end up going on), had a bunch of free time on her hands and decided to use that time in order to look up my ex's address, phone number, and family members. She started mentioning things about 'gouging out her eyes' in passing- just very violent things. I told her it made me uncomfortable and she said 'that's just how we talk in the army'. She kept talking about it. Said that if it made me uncomfortable 'I must still have feelings for her'. Which I don't, I just don't like hearing that kind of shit about anybody. I tried to tell her this, and she wouldn't hear it.

I come home from work one Monday evening and she's sitting at the table with all of the lights off. I come in and already know somethings wrong because normally she's cooking dinner and is talkative and...not like that. I ask her if everythings okay and she says 'yeah'. So I kiss her on the head. I ask her if she's hungry, says no. I start making food for myself. The minute I sit down she starts freaking out. Asking me all kinds of questions about my ex (whom I've had no contact with in almost three years); next thing I know she's in the bedroom banging her head into the wall. Next thing I know she has a kitchen knife up to her wrist. I grab it away from her. I calm her down. Get her in bed. The next morning I cried for hours. And she came home and held me, like it was all okay and that didn't happen. I asked her to go and talk to some one. She doesn't.

I start to withdraw. She doesn't register that her acting that way scared the fuck out of me, and blames my withdrawl on things like me not loving her anymore, or no longer being attracted to her. I'm nervous to talk to her because she reacts instead of responds. She has intermittent explosive disorder, and hasn't completely managed it yet. I'm still cuddling with her, kissing her, hanging out with her. Nothings really changed except that I haven't really been very sexually active since then, and she starts saying mean jokes to me about it. Like how I'm 'vanilla' and 'could never keep up', that I'm 'no fun' and she never gets laid. But then, when ever I would try to initiate something, she would push me away and say I was just doing it out of obligation. So, that makes me withdraw even more. It's like, she's mocking me for not having sex with her, and then won't let me initiate anything. I tell her that the things she says hurt my feelings; she says it's 'just a joke' or 'well it's true!'

Three weeks later, she takes a bunch of anti-anxiety meds and slams a beer. She says she 'wasn't fucked up', but she could hardly stand. I have a vivid image of her holding on to our closet door, naked, holding the clothing she wanted to wear so she could leave, with her eyes closed, streaming tears, swaying back and forth ever so slightly, face up at the ceiling. And then she looked over at me and could hardly keep her eyes open. She yelled at me from the kitchen that night, told me 'not to come near her', that I make her feel 'ugly and worthless and unloved'...just a bunch of shit. I calm her down again, get her into bed. The next morning I told her to get help or its over. At first she says 'ill start packing', but then decides to get help. I ask her to move back into the barracks.

So she does, and we're going to couples counseling. She sees a therapist alone once a week, and so do I. It's been two weeks since we started. Last night we went to dinner which ended up with her yelling at me in the car on the way home. Again, I calmed her down, and got her in bed, and cuddled up to her like it would all be okay.

tl;dr Help. Girlfriend is emotionally unstable and it's costing me my emotional stability. She's concerned with how I'll feel in twenty years, but not how I feel NOW. We are incredibly compatible, but I'm not sure this is worth it.

I’ve been off most platforms for a few years. I finally got rid of Facebook just over a year ago. I kept comparing myself to others (fully aware that most people only post the positive and NOT the negative) and it made me retreat. I stopped posting/sharing my life with others and eventually just deactivated altogether. I have anxiety, depression, and OCD so I’m sure it made the experience feel even more intense for me.

93,"Salutations everyone, long time lurker here. I'm 21, Asian Male, for context. I've been wanting to make this post for at least two months now, but could never bring myself to. Content Warning: I tend to drone on and on, so I apologize foremost for the inevitably long spiel. I'm searching for opinions to aid me in this dark abyss I frequent without volition. For background, I have been diagnosed to exert symptoms of MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), GAD (General Anxiety Disorder), and BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). My mental and emotional state is perpetually in a whirlpool state, switching from one emotion to the next. It's difficult to illustrate, but I trust most people here comprehend them to a certain degree. Now on to the main subject.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick backstory: I'm the middle child of three children, and the only male child in the family. Even as a kid, my emotions were always pronounced. It didn't help that the abuse exacerbated that trait. My father is changed now, but what he did for a whole decade cannot be erased. Not for me. More on that later. The abuse was pronounced and frequent, where he would fly into rages for no apparent reason, and constantly look for an avenue to release his fury upon, namely us. Our family were never really spared much of his wrath, only when he elected to leave the house in a fit of rage. As a result most of my formative years were lived in relative fear, anger and guilt, and as such an inferiority complex began to form. Emotions were not accepted at the time, and so my thirst for affection festered and broiled, bearing fruit as the multitude of disorders I now harbour. Everything was wrong to him, be it I didn't do it well enough, I didn't do it fast enough, et cetera. I was always the one at fault. Always. As so I begun to believe him, the young whippersnapper I was, that I was doing everything wrong constantly. Everything was my fault. And so I turned without in my bid for affection. 

&amp;#x200B;

All through the years I was in elementary school, all the way through college, I was teased, mocked and bullied for being the 'soft fat kid'. Years of scorn piled upon my relative inability to harness my emotions have twisted me into this visage that I now have to wear for foreseeably the rest of my life. I trusted people way too rapidly and simply, for any sign of affirmation I mistook for affection. That also ties in to how I had a crush on a girl for six years only to spiral into depression after she made it clear she wanted naught to do with me. Just last year, I had a psychotic breakdown because of -wouldn't you guess it- a girl, and unreciprocated love. Many weeks of self-harm later, I had to be forcibly subdued and diagnosed. Since then I've come to terms with many things in my life; why I'm always abysmal at relationships, why I can never perceive a girl as merely a friend without fantasizing about our life together, why my emotions are perpetually out of whack, why I feel so immensely, relative to other people. I'm happy to say that I'm better now, in the grand scheme of life. I understand my disorders as best I can, and I try, every day, to work with it instead of against it. I still can't let go of many things. I still can't not feel as strongly as I do without shutting everything off. But I'm trying. And I guess that's what holds true.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a few years since the abuse has ceased from within. I know I should let it go. He's changed now. I shouldn't hold it against him. It's not right. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I do.

&amp;#x200B;

I still hold it against him, almost against my will. Every day I see him, I am reminded of the solitude of a life I was forced to live for the last 15 years and am now forced to live, reminded that I never had a family to fall back on, reminded that I had to strike out into the world to search for the one thing that should have been abundant to me: Affection. It has affected many facets of my life, what he's done. My cognitive processes, my emotional trains of thought, my anxiety, my depression, my BPD. My thirst for affection, my bouts of emotional outbursts. All of it I trace back to him. I know it's not fair. He had his issues of his own to work out as well. But was it fair to me? More imperatively, should it matter?

&amp;#x200B;

I hate him. I loathe him so much that if I were to turn my emotions on around him, unprecedented rage would pour forth. The last thing I want is to rip this already broken household apart, but I cannot stand to even look at him, knowing that he is the reason for my broken life. For my loneliness. For my shame, guilt, and everything in between.

September 2018 to July 2019 I was in year 7 of secondary school which, for those who have different school systems, is for people from 11 to 12. I'm going into year 8 this september and I'm in top set (barely). If I remember correctly I was rank #47 which is way off top set by 17 and I am so glad I got good scores in science and maths (2 of the core subjects we had tests on). However, at the start of year 7 everything was perfect; I had tons of friends, I was smart, never missed a day of school but this was only for half of the school year. The last few months of the school year just wrecked any stability I had. My mental situation was torn to shreds... I started taking frequent days off of school, never got good scores and my autism just took control over me. My social situation was sh** too. I had lost 2 of my best friends because I'm so unbelievably stupid and I hung around people who were just plain nasty. However, the one person who sticked with me (slightly) was my ""best friend"" who I met when I was in year 5 (at the age of 9/10). I lied to so many teachers including possibly the nicest teacher I had ever met who really did care. The ROA (Rank Order Assessment) tests just metaphorically chucked me like a lifeless rag doll over a range of MILES. I had mental breakdowns during each tests and skipped a few due to the lack of capability to even get up from my lazy a**. I was so glad that the school year had ended but ofcourse this foreshadowed the oncoming disaster of a life I was about to dive in to. I don't do much everyday. I don't go outside often and don't talk to ""friends"" much either. I've quit trying to reach out to others on the internet to possibly make some type of friends but I have never once told someone my true identity so everybody who I talk to online knows me by a completely fake persona. That fake persona is different to me because they just seem to attract people to talk to them but in real life people avoid me like a wild big foot monster. 

To be quite honest, Reddit is like the only place I can vent and try to get advice like a little diary. 

I have promised myself and those who read this that once this summer holidays ends I will become a whole new person. I will try to write in a diary of sorts everyday and summarise what has happened every week or month. I'll probably post random stuff oer than that. I hope a few people can follow me on this journey because I don't think I can do this on my own.

So glad that I could vent and possibly have someone help me.

Thank you so much for reading.

108,"** please read my note at the end, but I appreciate any help. &lt;3 **

hi, im new to this subreddit so im sorry if i break any rules, but i need help, 16, and my parents don’t think i have any issues so I can’t talk to a professional. 

ever since i was young, i was always a “people pleaser”. i made sure everyone else was happy before me, but no matter what i did, i never made a stable friend and every time they would leave me for other people. It’s still this way now. i made online friends back in 2015 and only two of them ended up sticking around and being there for me. i don’t know why because i would sometimes get very angry with them for no reason and/or push them away and this terrifies me because if i break into a confusing fit of rage, then i feel as if they would leave me because I’m too “complicated” and “hard to understand”.  i tend to hold grudges for months on end, if not years, and i also hate people for no reason for a very long time. 

I’m terrified of meeting local people because I feel as if I do something wrong, they would attempt to murder/hurt/kidnap me or something of the sort, so I choose to meet people online that live in countries or states far from me under an alias not related to my actual name, and it’s the same for every website I have ever signed up for. Almost ALL of my few bonds are people I have met online, so any friend/boyfriend I mention may have been someone I met via a video game. Sometimes I get really terrified when I meet a doxxer, because I feel as if they would release my information and expose my true identity and someone would harm me and/or my family, so I am extra friendly with them.

On the other side of the spectrum, I don’t have a sense of identity and it makes me confused and scared for my future. I sometimes stare off into space and ask myself in my head, “who am I? who do I want to be? Cute? Edgy? Basic?” I always want to change up my look, and I often fantasise about being beautiful or attractive, older, younger, a different race, having a different name (this is very often), having a different hair/eye colour, and usually, I tend to change up my voice. For example, I would sometimes mix in a British accent with my American one, or I pretend like I’m from Britain by changing up the American spellings I use for propre British alternatives. I have no clue why I do this, but most of the time I do it unintentionally. It seems like I always change who I am depending on who I’m talk to, and I seem to lack a “backbone”. It’s really hard for me to make my own decisions, and my perspective on life and everything taboo is formulated based on everyone else’s opinions. 

More issues I have that tends to bother me is my slight impulsivity and my mood changes. When I meet new people, I want them to like me, so I usually buy something for them without even thinking about it. I tend to also engage with random people by flirting with them and realising that I don’t like them anymore after any activity we’ve done together and so I ghost them, but I feel absolutely awful when they express that I’ve hurt them, so I do it again and then the cycle continues. I also can be extremely happy at one point, and then someone could say a comment, or even give me some criticism, and then I would become extremely offended, mute, and sometimes even ignore them for a few hours, even if it’s just the smallest thing. I always feel rage boiling inside of me, but I usually don’t express it. I let it eat me away until I can’t handle it anymore and then lock myself in my room or my bathroom and then cry for hours on end, wishing that I was dead. However, I don’t want to die. If I died, that would mean that I would hurt more people and then I would really have no one. I want to be dead and alive at the same time during my breakdowns.  

The second to last thing is that I usually tend to think that my “online boyfriend” is cheating on me when I really have no reason to think that he is. For example, he went out to a party once, and when he didn’t respond, I went into panic mode and started freaking out while I was talking to one of my two best friends, and then she left and I wanted to break down. But eventually he texted back explaining how he saw a girl and was really interested in her but he loves me and wouldn’t do it. Despite this, after he didn’t answer again, I panicked.. again. I thought he was in the middle of making out with her, and I couldn’t get that thought out of my head. Eventually he came home, and he was tired, and he couldn’t talk to me, so I threw a fit, but kept it to myself of course, until I called another one of my friends and completely breakdown in front of him, and then hung up. I was screaming inside my head that he doesn’t love me anymore, while all my friend heard was my ugly crying. Feelings like this aren’t constant, because I do know that my “boyfriend” has trust issues as well, so he, without me telling him to, goes out of his way to prove that he hasn’t done anything wrong, and I do the same. Most of the time we’re happy, but if he doesn’t respond to me on Snapchat, but is active on another platform, I become paranoid and feel as if he doesn’t love me anymore. For him, it’s strange because I get the same feelings that he may kill me just like I do with real life people, although I have online dated several times before and I didn’t feel any of this. The last guy before him sent me into a spiral and told me he hated me after I accidentally.. “flirted” with his friend after we broke up and blocked me because he was sick of me and he found out. I definitely lost my sense of love after that, and after meeting the current guy, I’m head over heels for him and the thought of him leaving drives me to tears and makes me want to be dead and alive again. 

I’m sorry if this was really long, but I need help. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. AND PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT MY OBSCURE AND CONFUSING DATING LIFE. I KNOW, ONLINE FLINGS MAY NOT LAST, I DO NOT NEED TO HEAR IT FROM ANYONE.",09Aug2019,1
109,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, small details have been changed to protect my identity. I debated between posting here and r/vent because I just want to talk/bitch, but as I chose here because of my delicate mental state. If you want to offer advice, extreme mental health issues are involved and intertwined with the below post, so please, please, find it in your r/user heart to be gentle. Humorous comments are encouraged because I fully believe that laughter is the best medicine. 

Mods, if this is the wrong sub-reddit, please let me know. I don't want to break any rules. 

**TLDR:** BF's living situation is ridiculous, my disability, mental health issues and lack of other options make it difficult to leave.

**TW:** Mentions of abuse, anorexia, and suicide attempts.

Where to begin. Last year, I was in a vehicular accident that left me with an injury/disability that caused me to leave my dream job. I tied most of my identity and self confidence to this job ( do not recommend), as I have battled severe anorexia, PTSD, anxiety and depression. I am in constant pain, cannot drive, have panic attacks in the car, and have insomnia due to this. In addition, I am/was a workaholic and my current situation (can't go into details) has left me unable to get a part-time job. Believe me, I have explored options since I have been unable to work. Picture a Border Collie stuck in an apartment with owners who are couch potatoes and you'll get the gist. I have a routine that I stick to which has helped me with not resorting to extremely unhealthy measures.

As such, for financial reasons I had to give up my apartment that was close to my friends and move a few hours away with my LT boyfriend, who I will call [**Major Bummer**](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy). One of the ""lovely"" things about moving from a LDR to co-habitation status is that you realize that the time spent at their humble abodes are when they are in spit and shine mode. When I moved in, because I have problems with balance and dizziness, he had promised he would move my (tons of) boxes into a room that was allocated for my things. Three weeks and they finally were moved up there by fairies (aka my mom and I with careful supervision).

Major is hilarious, smart as a whip, extremely emotionally supportive with my mental health PTSD and disability issues, but he lives in a perpetual case of ""diet/life/next task starts Monday because Venus is in retrograde (even though he thinks horoscopes are BS, you get the gist)"", and he is the most stubborn person I have ever met other than my father. Also, he subsists on incomprehensible amounts of ""Go Go Juice"" and vast quantities of takeout. I am by no means perfect, but one of my biggest flaws is that I am an enabler and passive (sometimes passive aggressive if I get angry) and I self-flagellate when I'm upset at others, and I am my own worst enemy and biggest critic. Another element to this powder keg is that he is an extremely gifted arguer, while I was severely emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abused (it could have been ***A LOT*** worse but it left some scars) and conditioned into shutting down during arguments and petrified of confrontation.

**Background on that:** my parents are still (for god knows why, oh wait, finances ) married when they hate each other, and have hated each other, constantly argue and have slept in separate bedrooms for as long as I can remember. We rarely had people over, my friends felt uncomfortable and often used the phrase ""you could cut the tension with a knife."" While my mom is the best person I know, (she tried to make up for my dad's shortcomings) I grew up privately referring to my dad as Jekyll/Hyde. My mom also tried to paint a perfect image that everyone saw through, and my older sister, **""Giselle from Enchanted""** was absent and in a Disney Princess Fog of ""happy happy family and they all will live happily ever after""; while I got to play mediator and beg my mom and my mom's friends and family to help her leave my dad. Giselle ignored my pleas for help and asked my mom to stop calling her and upsetting her with my problems. To be fair, I did probably stress her out as my way of dealing with the family (and bullying and a bf with a not so covertly incestuous family) was anorexia until an intervention and hospital stays when I was about to die, depression, suicidal attempts, etc. Thankfully, Giselle has grown up and come out of the fog, grown into a lovely hippie and our relationship has vastly improved.

*If you have stuck with me this far, you are a trooper and I appreciate you.* What brings me to today's vent is that Major has caused me to have a MAJOR mental breakdown because he has devolved into a completely helpless annoyance who likes spending time with me until he can play RPG with his friends. I actually am fine with this (not my scene but do what makes you happy and I adore the friends with whom he plays) until a home incident occurred that has left us without a working kitchen and turned our first floor into a construction site. He also has had years worth of recycling backups (which I didn't realize the extent of before I moved in because they were well hidden), which then turned into trash backups (which occurred because he'd forget to take the trash out, I would but a lot of it was too heavy) and I would have had it all taken care of if I could drive. It slowly turned into an ant, then a rodent (whom I called Maurice to keep from crying constantly and to make the best of the situation), now the current fly infestation and the incident occurred 7 months ago and he has claimed to call the contractor and handle the insurance himself, but evidence shows otherwise. He, of course, is embarrassed which is why I feel like asking my mom/friends to help take everything out would be a betrayal of his trust.

Major has also asked me to lie to his parents about the progress about his kitchen. I have talked to him, had interventions, but he then gets frustrated with me acknowledges the issues, changes for a little but then something else happens or he takes steps backward. He also will get annoyed with me call me a nag (I don't remind him and push him barely at all because of my background) and sometimes turns it around on my flaws (of which I could list plenty, I'm an expert at answering the question what's wrong with me?) and obviously I can't make it change and I can't get through to him.

My mother has begged me to live with my parents, but I can't do that because the aforementioned background very much still exists, they always put me in the middle of their issues and I am dad's simultaneous GC/SG depending on the second which does wonders to my self esteem and mental health. My friends are not options to live with, and I am currently in a mental health state where other options do not seem viable. I currently hide on the top floor where there aren't too many issues, and of course he promises that it will all be taken care of this weekend. I beg that no one holds their breath, I don't want to be responsible for a subredditor's loss of oxygen. Also, I am not super religious, but I am starting to see parallels between the fly count and the locusts in the Old Testament.

Of course, the kryptonite is that I am very much in love with him and I want so badly to make this work and fix the situation (which I know I can't, but damn it, I wish I could). At this point, while I am still in pain, my only rope to climb out of this well is to get a job again. 

I am fully aware I am acting like an idiot, I am fully aware that I am to blame for enabling this behavior, and I see the red flags and what my future would be like. That is why this is here and not r/JustNoSO or r/relationships or any of the other wonderful support groups. I struggle between my love for Major and the reality that I can't change him.

110,"This is a message from a white girl who is going to tell you straight up, that us white people can empathize all we want, but we will never understand what you have had to go through in this country, and in your life. 

It's a really delicate subject for a white person to bring up and try and talk about, and try to defend black people and empathize. 
But theres so much that we white people pretend to think we know what black people go through. I could make a godam list of things I notice that black people suffer from. I can empathise. But i will mever until I walk in a black woman's shoes. 

i have severe PTSD and Bipolar ll. And ok, everyone who tries to empathise with me, i dont know, it just feels so surfaced. Like when people say ""my condolences"" at a funeral. Like it's.....forced. 
These nurses and therepists have heard my story and then later one said...""wheres the floozy one?"" 
I had told her in confidence my sexual abuse history and that it turned me into slut in highschool. Out of all the horrible things I told her that happened to me, she focused on the one thing she could judge me for. She used my world against me. 

I dont want to speak for all white and black people. But that was something I could use that's the closest I could feel to understanding what black people go through. By judgong them for being black, you strip away else that make them who they are, and their personal identity.

Like imagine you are white and you go up to pay for gas and you say we should hang out sometime to the black cashier and the pepper spray you because you're white and the black cashier calls the police and says ""a white person tried to rob me"" and all the black cops are there in minutes. And you are arrested for aszault yoy have that on your record you cant get a job. And the black people in suits on the street avoid you because your a white man who is homeless all because a black girl was intimated by your white skin color because white are dangerous.

See where im going with this? 
 
I thought about all this when I watched Hannibal the comedian. And he had this bit about buying a bunch of apple juice with his girlfriend. And they are in line and an old man in front if him turned and shook head at them like ""nope"". And Hannibal thinks he's judging him for all the apple juice he got. When really it was the fact that Hannibal's girlfriend was White and the old man was offended. And Hannibal said, ""...but like for once, i lived in a world where racism didn't exist and this man was just an apple juice hating asshole"". 

 Empathy is the key for now to keep everything stable for now. 

Maybe theres no ""cure"" except just walking in black mans shoes and opening your mind. EMPATHY

I do not hope to offend with this post. Not all white people are racist but i just want black people to know, that there are millions of white people put there who are  trying. 

Connecting over life issues helps with the empathy.

112,"Hello everyone, I am a 22 years old man from Italy. I try to descrive shortly my recent story with mental issues.I have always been for my entire life a quite anxious person, I tend to worry about stuff a little bit than most of people ,but I ve been somehow managing well my anxiety. I left Italy and moved to England because I was confused about my future, I didn't know what career I wanted to pursue so I decided to live this experience abroad. It lasted two years, I had a couple of jobs and then I decided to become an online entrepreneur, so I started studying. I became an alchoolic to handle  general anxiety  and stress until I started to go back to Italy because of a breakup with my girlfriend.I continued drinking for self medicating and studying at the same time until I had a mind blowing panic attack which brought me in the weird feeling I constantly feel. From that moment my life stopped, I stopped studying, I stopped projects, everything paused. Instead of living life,from that moment  I ve been constantly overanalize it,everything seems weird for me, it seems weird that I am alive, that I am a thinking being, it feels weird that I have a memory, it feels weird that I can talk without think about what I want to say because somehow I can do it. It feels weird, the fact that I am conscious makes me feel weird, the fact that I have instincts that make me do stuff almost automatically makes me feel weird, communicating with other people and understanding what they say makes me feel weird, even writing this post on reddit makes me feel weird! Life itself makes me feel weird.. But as soon I would have a few beers, these feeling would disappear...and they made me live. I am now detoxed from alcohol, sober for a month and a few weeks now and that was my only ""cure"" for this problem. I am on Xanax now which keeps my anxiety under control and I take an antidepressant(Cymbalta) because this loop of alcoholism, anxiety, stress and this feeling of weirdness about life made me hit the rock bottom. I am not depressed anymore, anxiety is under control, but this weird feeling about life doesn't go away. I ve been doing psychotherapy for a long time now and I feel better just when I walk away from my psychologist's office, then the feeling comes back. I ve seen also a few other psychologists and psychiatrists but none of them could give me a name for this problem.. I am desperate and I know that deep inside me I have all that I need to succeesd and live an happy life but I just don't know how to cope with this feeling now. I wonder if anyone of you has the same issue and It would be awesome to discuss it with you.",09Aug2019,1
113,"So I’ve already had a bad experience with a psychologist. My first one was a 6’8 300 pound with a very “jockey” attitude. He taught me practices of making fun of people to feel better....I’m serious. 

My second one that I’m seeing right now started off very well but I lost lots of trust for her which is one of the most depressing things (I thought she cared). I’m going through a really tough time and I’m weak right now and she almost takes advantage of that to inflate her ego. It’s like she wants to be so powerful and I don’t understand why. And I’m not overreacting or misreading. It’s ridiculously passive. She seems very rude but in a VERY passive way so I can’t even call her out for it.  

And I literally have no idea why she doesn’t like me. It just seems like she has so much of an ego, and her sessions almost feel like lectures. She talks a lot  about feminism, which is fine, but it’s a psychology session, not a political class. She also remembers nothing about me each session, to the point where I have to reminder her of a lot about me. I get it, psychologists are busy, and are people. But aren’t they supposed to keep tabs on their patients? And at least remember what they are going through. Talking to her is like the same thing as talking to siri. She does not care...it’s so weird to explain. I don’t trust her and I’m gonna leave.  

I’m really having problems trusting psychologists. It seems like so many of them take their own problems out on others and it becomes very hard for me to move on and find someone else. I just feel betrayed.

117,"I wanted to share something that has helped me a ton. A bit about my mental health history...

I was viciously bullied all through grade school 1-12, several incidents probably could have been brought to court if I had the courage to speak up at the time. I never had friends until I graduated high school. After high school I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was asked to go on suicide watch, but decided against medication as I was about to move and thought getting away from where I grew up and had been living my entire life would help (and it did). I’m now 25, happily married, and am satisfied in my vocation (which has a lot to do with helping high school students, being their friend, etc).

I’ve never been seen as an “emotional” person. I’ve always been pretty blunt, straight forward, and monotone. It’s where I found my sense of humor, being the straight forward guy who says what everyone else is thinking but doesn’t feel comfortable saying.

Anyways, my outlet. I struggle deeply with feelings of restlessness. Something will happen, I’ll read something, and my chest feels like there are a million fire ants crawling around inside of my lungs. I can’t sit still. It’s like I need to scream, or run really fast, or take a sedative to calm myself down and for my whole life it has sat inside of my chest until it eventually goes away.

I discovered writing, primarily poetry and discourses. Sitting down and writing what I’m feeling has been so incredibly therapeutic and helpful for me. Not only does it help  me process my feelings and turn those feelings into an action, I have something at the end of it I can be proud of.

I can read over what I’ve written and in my own words understand what made me so upset. I have an archive of how I have processed things in the past to reference if I feel those same things again.

I know this isn’t much, but I have found so much joy in writing and so much peace on how it has improved my mental health. It’s an amazing thing to share what you’ve written, even if it’s sad, and have others take notice and relate. Here’s something small. I hope someone smiled reading this and discovers how helpful writing can me!

118,"I have been smoking for 20 years. I have kids and know I should stop but I dont want to. I want to want to quit, but I cant ever find the will to care.

I have a good job Im good at, where I work mostly online. I also have no friends. In the past 8 years I have really only talked, like not work talk, with one adult human. Other then that its like a few minutes of pleasentries and weather. I got divorced from that one human about 3 years ago and havent really had a real conversation with another person since then.

I get along with my kids just fine. I love them. Its other humans I cant stand or are too anxious to be around.

So I know I should quit, but smoking is literally all I look forward to. Its the only thing I do in a day I actually enjoy. I like smoking more then I like people. I have a metric ton of life insurance so kids are alright without me.

123,"Hello, 

this is something I've wanted to talk about for a while mainly just to see if anyone else feels like this. It doesn't affect my life in any way (yet?) to I guess worry or seek help.

First of all, I'm not heartless, I do feel guilt and remorse to some extent and I in no means would ever put anyone in danger just because I don't care about them.

At first, I never paid attention to it because my mother has always been extremely emotional and seemed to get attached to anyone and anything so naturally I thought that I was just normal and she was going over the line with her feelings. But then as I grew I realized I never had any emotional connection with my friends, I could take or leave em. And at some point, I was so tired and bored of all the people in my life I pretty much just left them on ""read"" and got new friends. My new friends are all great people and each one of them is useful for a certain activity but once again I've never felt like I wouldn't want to lose them or would feel bad if I did? I know it sounds bad but basically, they are all replaceable.   
The second time I suspected I wasn't right was when my teacher died (outside of school, she used to teach me how to play a recorder). Was invited to the funeral, didn't really want to go because I didn't understand why I even should. I was little though, around 14, so maybe I was just an ignorant kid.  
The third time is when my grandmother died, she was a nice old lady. Always a fun time at her place with my relatives. She came and lived with us when she found out she had cancer. That is however when I realized how annoying it was to have her around, I wanted privacy but I never could. She couldn't even talk or walk on her own a few weeks before her death. I know I should have helped more but oh well. When she died all the relatives came over and were crying and holding each other and talking to her corpse. I stayed in the living room with my dad and chatted with him. I expected to feel sad but I didn't. I still don't.   
After that for a while everything was normal but now I've noticed I get annoyed with people more frequently and wish they didn't contact me so often and that I could just have one quiet day where nobody talks to me at all. I'm currently in uni and looking for a job with a decent income to move out and isolate myself from everyone for a bit just to rest. Not forever but just for some time. There is so much unnecessary noise in life I've felt like riping peoples vocal cords out.  
I don't know what else to say but I just seem to get tired of people so quickly.

Maybe there's something wrong with me, maybe I'm just a massive asshole or maybe I'm just not sure of my own feelings and thoughts.

Thank you for reading and I hope someone here feels the same way so I don't feel like I should change myself.",09Aug2019,1
124,"As said above, I’m trying to find advise on the best help for my partner who is currently struggling with MH. We live in the UK, I’m a UK resident and he’s from AUS but has a two year visa that ends in November. 

He’s 22 and has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Two years ago he suffered a bad episode due to a breakdown of a relationship and work stress, he was put into a hospital for a short period due to an attempt to commit suicide.

Fast forward to our current situation, I’m currently working 4 days a week and he is also working 4 days. We both get paid minimum wage and live with my Mum. We’re trying to save as much as possible but seem to be getting know where. Today I explained I’m trying to budget and we’re limited to set amounts of money a day.. 

Our savings are not as high as he thought, and he’s struggling with finding a purpose for working so hard and not seeing a return. He only has three months left on his visa and hates the jobs he’s in but fears he can’t find another job.  

We’ve discussed maybe he returns to AUS early to seek better work but he has to return with me and needs enough money to survive there before his first pay check. 

We haven’t bought new clothes or anything expensive in a while and it’s really pushing him into a negative view of “what’s the point anymore”

His mental health is deteriorating by the day. I’ve provided solutions like maybe quitting his job, flying home early to find a job there, hAving time off or maybe speaking to a therapists but he’s refusing everything. I feel shut out and useless and I want to help before things get worse... what’s the best thing to do for someone who’s refusing every option.",09Aug2019,2
125,"I've had depression a long time, it was incredibly debilitating and any of the jobs I've worked in my life were basically just so people would leave me alone. Sure I needed a bare minimum not to starve but I rarely ever spent the rest of the money I made. I never really wanted anything. The reason I worked was because then people would stop telling me I needed a job. Even though the jobs I worked sucked they were enough to give me a bit of breathing room from friends and family getting after me about what I'm doing with my life. Even though the people around me meant it as help, to me it was constant nagging about something pointless when life already felt like a chore to me.  


Now I'm taking anti-depressants and they've really helped. I don't feel depressed constantly for no reason, and I have energy to do things.  


Yesterday was the first day I've ever really worked for money. Not in some greedy money is everything way but just...

126,"I really don't know how to say this, but just don't get confused okay?

The reason I'm suicidal is because I heard about a mental disorder called Reactive Attachment Disorder. When I saw the symptoms, I was shocked because the symptoms sounded like the things I went through. But then I saw that it's more common in children. I went to see a psychiatrist to make sure this was true. But she told me it's more common in children. I was starting to get frustrated because I actually felt like I **HAD** this disorder. If I wasn't diagnosed with it, I'd get even more frustrated. But since I know that it's more common in children, I started getting suicidal. I was thinking to myself, ""I want a new life. I want restart my life. I want to be abused. I want to be a child again.""  I keep saying/thinking that to this day. 

Another thing I want to talk about is medications. I noticed that alot of people weren't taking me serious. Anytime I would talk about my emotional abuse, people would say stuff like ""that's not real abuse"" or "" that's not that bad."" So I was  left thinking that emotional abuse isn't as serious as sexual or physical abuse. I was wishing that I was physically/sexually abused. I want people to take me seriously. My own damn family can't even take me seriously. So...all that thinking gave me an idea. ""What if I abused medications?"" Because abusing medications would make my symptoms worse? I planned to lie to my psychiatrists and tell them that I needed Paxil and Prozac. But I never told them the REAL reason why. 

And the last thing I want to talk about isn't that serious, but I'll talk about it anyway. I want to run away from my home because of my binge-eating. My sister gets mad at me when I over-eat. And I feel extremely guilty. I feel like I get sudden impulses to eat food. But my mom and the doctors are focused on me vomiting, but I don't vomit anymore. But they'll never address my binge-eating problem. (And for some reason, my mom thinks that telling me to ""stop vomiting"" or ""stop binge eating"" is gonna help me). My binge-eating has gotten very extreme to the point where I want to run away.

128,"My manager didn’t know how to handle it, so he brought in HR, the owner, and himself. The owner did all the talking. Telling me I need to grow thicker skin, and suck it up. There was a lot of other shit said. But that was the gist. I’ve only been here 2 weeks, and neeeed the job. But I can’t work with people or for a company who cannot respect the LGBTQ community. 

I think that what she said yesterday hit me extra hard because I came out of the closet last November. And since have lost my parents, and 4 out of 6 siblings. And the 4 I lost, are my sisters. A girl needs her sisters more than her brothers. But that’s all I got now. 

I have also lost so my friends due to my coming out. So for someone who has seemed to be fine with my sexuality (I’ve worked with this girl before) to suddenly be so homophobic. I guess just reallllyyyy got to me. 

But then to have my boss, who says they have an open door policy, tell me to grow thicker skin, and suck it up. Really got to me as well.

130,"Hi everyone. For some info about me and my situation, I'm a 16 year old girl who knows a 16 year old boy online who is suicidal.

I first started messaging him whenever I commented on a post he made on social media. His post talked about how he had depression, social anxiety and body dysmorphia, and talked about not having a good family. I commented and left a list of suicide hotlines, places to reach out and get support, etc. Just basic resources. Then he replied asking me to message him.

Through messaging him since early July, I've become extremely worried about him. He told me he has attempted suicide I think twice before and even though he had a therapist, he doesn't seem to trust him much. It actually concerns me a bit since his therapist seems somewhat unprofessional -- the therapist comes over to his house to play video games for him, and I think they got takeaway food during an appointment once, or had lunch or something. He sees his therapist as a friend which.. I mean, I didn't want to mention anything, but it seems unprofessional. 

He doesn't want to reach out to his family; he seems to have a terrible relationship with all of them. His friends don't know about his mental illnesses I don't think. He spends a lot of time worrying and he etold me yesterday that he self-harmed; he cut his finger to ""practice"" what he planned to do when school started. He wanted a way to get out of school. 

The difficult thing is, I live in the UK, and he lives in Israel. I don't know him in real life, don't even know what city he lives in, so I can't support him as much as I want to. I've been getting increasingly worried about him. His therapist doesn't seem to be helping, he has virtually no support system, and it seems like I'm the only one he talks to about things like this -- which is a responsibility I absolutely don't want to have; I don't want to keep this a secret and I encourage him often to speak with his therapist and reach out for support. 

Do you think I should report him somehow, or tell someone? I don't know how to keep him safe and having committed suicide in the past, I worry in case he would do it again. When you believe someone is in danger, you are encourage to call the emergency services in your country according to different websites. But I don't even know where he lives.

I told him this, just so he can hopefully understand what I mean: ""i'm in a position where i know someone online who is considering committing suicide. it's absolutely important to me that you get help and find someone you can talk to -- i don't want to keep this a secret.""

This is me basically asking for advice -- I don't know what to do, but I really want to tell someone, just to make sure he's safe.

Things I have done so far:
- Given him some resources, and told him the suicide hotline number in Israel
- Followed the contacting procedure necessary for the social media 
- Emailed Samaritans, Childline and Papyrus about a month ago",09Aug2019,3

132,"Long story short I am an individual who has had a severe combination of anorexia and bulimia for a lot of my life.. I also drink daily (not huge amounts say 3-4 drinks average lately more) I recently started using meth again and it has turned into a more intense addiction…
i have been using pretty much daily since early June and initially it wasn’t as haunting until I had my first over amp and was up for days and had my first hallucinations and nearly felt like I was going to die. My heart hurt so much afterwards.
i am a fairly beautiful individual (I work in a apperance is important setting and have A LOT of guys wanting to be with me/be my boyfriend/etc) and haven’t  received any negative side effects to my appearance (besides weight loss.. if you count that as negative. Basically I have been using the meth in an effort to stop binging and purging so much and spending so much money on food.. like I’m probably over $40000 in debt due to the b/p (binge purge constantly buying enormous amounts of food to eat and throw up) addiction and will file for bankruptcy in the future. Not to mention over a $1 million spent in treatment costs to save my life). I feel like I function on it though now ever since my over amp. I’ve gone from purging over a 100 times a day to purging maybe 10-15 times a day (rarely none.. when I use the meth to occasionally fast). I eat daily. I am a normal weight (borderline underweight) for my age and height. I take vitamins and multi vitamins everyday and drink a lot of Gatorade zero and electrolyes to protect my body (and usually keep it down). I’ve ceased the use of diet pills and laxatives (for quite a while now actually. Mixed the meth a few times with some hydroxycuts and it completely fucked with my body and I was at work and felt absolutely horrible and was shaking so I stopped that. I sleep everyday at least 6 hours. I know my limits now and do not do line after line like I used too. I get stuff that I know is mostly pure from tests I have performed. I have gained some weight. I am purging less. I am more functioning and my hoarding has dramatically improved (I was a terrible hoarder with a disgusting place that looks so much better now). I never stay up more than 36 hours anymore (if even that) on days I have to work I only stay up MAXIMUM 18 hours.
In other words meth has improved a lot of aspects in my life but I know it’s all a lie. No one has confronted me. But I’m sure people know. I hide my usage really well and do my make up use three different type of eye drops and wear contacts so that helps with dilation of my pupils (which without this are considerably more noticeable). People know I have an ed so I’m sure some assume I am doing adderall or smoking weed (or both).
However, since tolerance has gone way up, I no longer have suppression of appetite really like I used too. I binge and purge daily again and have gained some weight. Looking to cut this addiction out of my life as I don’t truly crave meth I just do it as a party drug and because it makes all aspects of my life a bit more exciting(my eating disorder will always be my biggest addiction. I can’t let that go. I’ve quit meth before and can quit again. I was even kidnapped and shot up with meth when I was younger yet have no craving for needles and am terrified of them. After I got shot up I didn’t do it for over two years after that and like to smoke and snort only.) I was parachuting a little earlier this year when I worked my old job that required longgg hours but only did it to stay up. I just don’t want this to get out of control and I have paranoia that because I throw up so much it could stop my heart. I am so paranoid I took myself to the er twice and they said all was well despite the meth use (have done for over three years now on and off) and ekg blood work everything was good yet I have severe paranoia. Heart rate never goes above 130 as I do low doses compared to other users. I need advice please on what to do and what could happen if I don’t stop. Thank you.",09Aug2019,3

One thing that bothers me is that lately (last 2-3 months) whenever I read about new discoveries, especially in quantum physics, I feel alienated from the world a bit. It's that these discoveries are so weird like ""quantum loop gravity"", which makes me feel like the world is just some made up place because those concepts are so... out there, if you know what I mean.

My sister is saying she has anxiety and this is due to our childhood and current situation. Which is fine I can help her with that I’m here to listen however. She doesn’t ask how I feel. Doesn’t know the thoughts I have. She is a big personality constantly brings me down. Her way or no way. She’s right I’m wrong. This has been this way most of my life. I regularly think about what it would be like if I wasn’t here. I get through my days because I tell myself once this gets unbearable it’s ok because I have the control to end my life.  Now I’m not saying I want to kill myself. But I think that I’m the only person who can control that and no one can stop me. Every other part of my life is controlled by others. Yet my sister doesn’t see this. So she was telling me about how she was being attacked in a specific situation involving me and my aunt. I explained to her that she acted in a childish way and didnt listen to what I was saying and that she wasn’t being attacked. She says that I disregard her feelings as she felt that way. I said she doesn’t care what I say she’s telling me I was attacking her. She always thinks she has it the worst out of us. But she takes nothing to do with the hard part she can do what she wants and I can’t. I’m not saying I have come out the worst I’m just saying why can’t we accept it’s shit for the both of us. 

As you can see we don’t really see eye to eye here. I think this maybe a situation we cannot fix and will have to never speak about it for the sake of our relationship. But I have had it to capacity now with her. 

Any suggestions or advice.",09Aug2019,2
135,"August of 2019 has been the worst month of my life so far. 

This is due to a number of things that have accumulated over the past few months and now have gotten incredibly bad. 

1. I am nearly in a year long relationship (10 months) and it has been going really well. She is an international student meaning that her student visa has now expired and has gone back home (she is 7 hours ahead). Everything was going great, but every time she would go back home our communication would reduce significantly and mostly due to her fault. I would try to reach out but she would ignore my messages and when we would talk she would try to rush off the phone. Now that she has gone back home without knowing if she is coming back it has gotten much worse. My hopes for this fantastic relationships are slowly decreasing and I dont know what to do. I love her too much to leave her, but I cant continue this horrible communication for how many months mainly due to my mental health being affected so much.

2. I have failed  a few classes at my university, mainly due to me putting minimum effort and now it come back around and my resits are a few days away. I am somewhat prepared, but mentally I am feeling so worthless that I cant seem to push myself to study and when i do i cant concentrate. 

3. My future is so uncertain. I dont even know if im going to have a job when i finish. This is stressing me so much cause if this long distance thing continues, I wont be able to go see her if i am not financially stable. 

4. My parents are both ill. My dad had a heart attack last year and it seems that he has fully recovered, but I cant tell if he is trying to push through it and pretend everything is okay. My mum has a severe case of lime disease  and she keeps mentioning that if they both pass away unexpectedly that I know where all the important information is stored and who to contact. 

These 4 things are  making cry everyday and if im not crying im wanting to cry and cry. I cant get help because when i do talk to a counsellor, they dont help. Getting it out isnt enough at this point.  I just dont know what to do... i keep getting thoughts of what if i just jump infront of a train or a car, but then i remember that if do that  everyone i love will become just as sad and depressed  as i am, if not worse. I wouldnt do it  either way cause its not in my character, but i am so scared that I will break sooner or later and I dont know when that will be.  

Im posting this mainly because i need to get it all out with no filter involved and i am in desperate need of guidance. Im scared of saying these things to my friends because they have their own shit going on and I cant put something this heavy on their shoulders. 

I honestly have no clue of what im doing and what to do...",09Aug2019,3
136,"First I don't have health insurance and very little money which is part of the reason I'm asking here but I feel like I need some type of help: Therapy, Psychiatry, support group, not sure. 

I'm 33 years old always had ambition but never a lot of drive, always told  how intelligent I am but never ""applied myself""  For my whole life I've never known ""what I want to do"" I've bounced around several different careers, I've had a few I enjoyed but I was living in poverty and extremely stressed about keeping a roof over my head. I've had others that paid enough not to stress out but I loathed the job and hated waking up everyday. I've never been able to find a balance. 

So I tend to cling to other good things happening in my life (relationships typically) and obsess and ruin them because I'm singularly focused on them instead of focusing on bettering myself or my position. Then when I inevitably destroy them it leaves in a deep depression where I don't feel like leaving bed for days or weeks,a few years ago I became a bit of an alcoholic  after a breakup (and some other life circumstances) and I was unemployed with pretty much zero ambition or drive for about a year and a half, and while I'm working now I'd say I still have not fully recovered.

Is it possible I've been ""depressed"" nearly my whole life? I think I generally have a positive outlook, don't really ever have suicidal thoughts but again always been low energy and very irritable, always did poor in school because I hated homework. When I started college I was prescribed ADD and Adderall and later Vyvanse certainly helped a ton with being productive, and while I really don't like taking them but I feel absolutely useless without them. 

**TL;DR** Have trouble setting goals, planning, sticking to things unless unhealthily obsessed, very low energy, irritable, tried to self-medicate with alcohol for a period(unsuccessfully obviously). Only thing that's even slightly been helpful are amphetamines. Constant procrastinator always get in my own way constantly by overthinking things and developing an extreme amount of anxiety. I have no idea what I need to work on (chicken:egg) where do I start? Thank you",09Aug2019,2

138,"Recently came off the anti depressants i was on which was my own choice. I have had my first assesement and even though the therapist was quite nice and understanding i was told that my case is complex and none of what they have to offer suits my needs. after that towards the end of the session  i was told they were going to write to me and refer me to an expert. 

I am in the uk and this has been an absolute joke i am only 21 and feel like i am getting worse. People will compliment me on my looks and i really dont give a fuck i just want to be heard and not have to deal with these demons in my head anymore i feel like i am going insane one minute my mood is okay and the next minute i am full of rage. I have deleted all of my social media accounts where i was very active and i just want to be left alone away from all of the bullshit brainwashed society.

 I have the worst paranoia sometimes i feel as if people are going to harm me the therapist told me i have signs of ptsd. i am always very cautious of people. When girls try to hit on me i have no intention of flirting anymore i really can not be bothered. i am a frequent gym goer and i love it because i can be left alone and my demons cant get to me then i just want things to be better. i left my job because i couldnt be bothered with the bullshit anymore i need to take care of myself thanks for listening to my rant .",09Aug2019,2
139,"I'll keep this short because I dont wanna bore people but sometimes I just genuinely cant tell if I'm a bad person or not. I have grown up thinking I always was a decent person, I do have a lot of people who tell me I am and I seem to get on well with a lot of people but sometimes I question myself that I'm not a good person and that I'm weirdly deep down just manipulating everyone into liking me.

I never used to be this way but unfortunately I was last year with a girl who just wasnt great for me and convinced me this way. We would have fallouts and I definitely wasnt perfect and know I need to be better but she would always tell me I was a bad person and simply manipulated everyone else into thinking I was a nice person. At times I could have done much much better but I really dont think I was ever deep down nasty to her. I know this is obviously one side of the story so I understand it's difficult to see. I just found it very hard when the girl I liked so much would call me evil and it's been months but its had a lasting effect. 

Any advice is appreciated - how can I convince myself I am a good person again?",09Aug2019,1
140,"Today my sister in law tried to commit suicide. She’s still with us, but when the doctors were with her she said she still wants to kill herself. 
I’ve had my own dance with mental health problems in the past. When I was 21 my cousin and a close friend both ended things and I suppose I never really dealt with that properly. In the past few years I struggled with depression and anxiety but thankfully never hit anywhere near rock bottom. 

I suppose I’m just looking for people’s experiences and how to best help brother and sister in law.

141,"I’m not sure if this belongs on here or in r/askwomenadvice but I’ve noticed a pattern with my mental health and I think it could be hormonal? This may be too long (or too rambly) to read but if anyone can shed some light that’d be fantastic.

So in a huge nutshell, here’s how it goes:

A couple days before my cramps kick in, I get extremely erratic, confident, happy(?) I call it the ‘ego boost’, I’m crazily energetic and productive (usually, I clean or rearrange my room, last month I drastically cut my hair (I haven’t had a hair cut in about 5 years and now I have a diy fringe lol). This time I socialised like crazy, spent a tonne of money on drink and drugs despite being -£1400 deep into my £1500 overdraft allowance and then studied really really well and healthily for a day which was today, I worked out a time sheet, stuck to it and got a crazy amount done). This “productivity” lasts about 1-2 days, usually 1, before I fall back into the ‘rut’.

Then my cramps kick in. They are excruciating. The pain is panic worthy. I’m buckled over, white as a sheet, sweating, vomiting painfully (out of both ends) and pretty much crying in recovery position for the next 5-7 days. 

I’m hit with PMS pretty immediately with the cramps, I’ll have a couple ‘warning cramps’ maybe a day before. However, I need to make this clear, this isn’t ordinary PMS. I am hit with the big D, and not the enjoyable kind. My very short lived productivity ends abruptly and is replaced by a rage that honestly makes me feel like I’ve lost my sanity, feelings of despair, hopelessness, loneliness, hatred - the whole shebang. This will till my next “productivity day” 3 weeks later where I fully accept that I’m ‘cured!’.

I retreat from socialising again, I get suicidal ideation, will be on the brink of panic attacks throughout the next few weeks and I become my own and everyone else’s worst enemy all over again. It seems most severe at the start, but I’m wondering if it only feels so severe because it is directly contrasting the super high positivity of the couple days that came before? Or perhaps it’s PMS on top of poor mental health? Or perhaps PMS is just the couple happy days? Can it work like that?!

So, I am on a waiting list for therapy, although I have just started a short 6 week CBT course with a therapist on the phone to get me through my uni resits. This whole cycle is what messed me up with university in the first place. I snapped during assessment period, went to a doctor and it took me a couple months to recoup but pretty sure I just burnt out from the stress on top of just not taking care of myself whilst also having my period - (I seriously cannot overplay how much it messes me up for the week as well, I’m zombified, I’m unrecognisable really, I’m hideously angry and overwhelmed).

It’s literally become a cycle that corresponds with my periods.

I’ve always had awful periods, (irregular, pain and severe low moods with PMS. When I got the contraceptive implant at 16 I had 2 years of constant bleeding and fully developed an anxiety disorder and experienced feeling suicidal for the first time, my mother had later called it “an unbearable few years for everyone in the house because it wasn’t normal puberty” lol). At 18, I came off the implant and got the copper coil (non-hormonal) and I thought I was sorted. Cured. At the same time, I had also moved out, broken up with a long-term (high-school) sweetheart, and considered the next 2 months of pure joy a result of dumping a toxic person and experiencing independence in a hormone-free body for the first time.

Looking back, this joy was honestly just my ego exploding. I was spending and drinking and doing drugs far more than I’ve ever been used to (I’m a pretty sober person other than smoking), lost a TONNE of weight and thought I was gods gift, aced assessments and thought I was a fucking genius because I was getting 1sts on essays I was giving in a week late. I had different guys back to the house every other day, I was a ‘social butterfly’. I juggled uni and a job and a social life pretty well. I’ve never been able to do that, and not ever again since. 

Within a month or two I stopped functioning as a human being pretty much all together. And from there on I’m pretty sure this ‘cycle’ formed. I’m 21 now and nothing has changed, I’m struggling with uni and seem incapable at maintaining any friendship because I drop off the grid every month and cannot function. 

I am left with this predictable and unmanageable cycle all month bar the few days off I get that I like to convince myself is happiness because honestly, what I feel when I routinely convince myself I’m cured for a day, is what I wish I could feel like for the other 28-9 days of the month. 

What is going on? Anyone got any similar experiences? Can periods seriously cause this much of a shit storm? If so, they’ve destroyed my life, I would have gotten my ovaries closed off years ago (can you even do that?) I’ve thought about things like BDP purely because 2 of my brothers suffer from it (as does my current partner) and they’ve all mentioned it to me just in case, but it just doesn’t sit right with me, i don’t really explain the ins and outs of my brain to them, I really don’t think it’s that, could it all literally be hormonal?

I honestly just want to understand it all because today has been that productive day, my cramps have just kicked in full force, and I’ve locked myself in a spare room after raging out at my partner for falling asleep before 9 for no other reason than I felt suddenly and overwhelmingly lonely. I am currently absolutely terrified for what’s already begun to hit.",09Aug2019,1

hey,

i'm going to try summarise my dad's whole backstory in a couple sentences, so please bear with me reddit, i'm new.

my dad was physically and emotionally abusive towards my mum up until i was about five years old. he'd punch her, hit her head against a window sill and then repeatedly tell her that she couldn't tell the police; that they would always side with him. my mum left her full time job and took on part-time work when she had me while he was still working. he refused to pay for anything for me and her; she had to pay him back for buying me clothes, food etc, otherwise he'd blow up at her. he started emotionally abusing me when i was about eleven, insinuating that nothing i did was ever good enough; making fat-shaming comments to myself and my mum; being openly homophobic, sexist and mysogynistic. i remember my mum was always scared to go to the beach in a swimsuit because of how he'd make her feel about herself and her body- when she finally gained the courage, he gave her the most disgusted look and to this day, it makes my blood boil. i only really started calling him out on his bullshit when i got to high school. he'd come home and instantly start yelling and telling me and my mum to clean up the house and pick at everything that wasn't quite right for him. i'd yell back at him and then it'd always turn into a huge argument which always somehow ended with ME being the one at fault, and with him being this innocent little victim. i was told to ""get the fuck out of my house"" when i was TWELVE. i saw a psychologist about him once and he said he thought my dad was a psychopath, or at the very least highly narcissistic.

the other day, i had a panic attack in the kitchen because of him; i feel this tightness in my chest whenever he walks into the room because i know he'll always have something to belittle me for. i was crying to my mum, and i told her it was dad's fault i was so anxious. i didn't know he was in the room. she says she looked over my shoulder, and he was standing in the corner of the room with this indescribable look on his face, like a smirk.

**if you couldn't be bothered reading that, just know my dad's an emotionally abusive asshole**

today, i heard a fight in the kitchen and as usual, he was yelling at my mum for not doing something \~quite right\~, and i just lost it. i was yelling, ""you ruined my life! you ruined my life!"" and i told him how he'd made me suicidal once last year. you will not believe what he said next, friends. ""once?"" AND THEN HE SMIRKS, as if to say it had only happened once, so who gives a shit, right?

i kept yelling and yelling and he'd moved in and was just staring down at me. and for the first time in my entire life, i saw my dad cry. his eyes were watering and his mouth was twitching up and i just felt so bad for some unknown reason but i was so angry i kept going until he finally left.

and now, i'm sitting in my room and i have no fucking idea why, but i feel terrible. like deep down, i hate that i made him cry because i have honestly never seen him do that before and it just feels WRONG, and i feel like a horrible person and i don't know why, maybe it's because of how he's manipulated me all my life but i hate it. i shouldn't feel bad, but i do and it sucks. i'm worried that he'll kill himself because of what i said, and it'll all be my fault and i can't deal with that.

i honestly just need someone to talk to :'(

143,"I've had severe anxiety for almost all of my life and depression almost constantly for the past 2 years. I think part of it was caused by my parents. I'm 16 now so I still live with them. When I was younger I realized that my parents were different from a lot of other parents. 

My dad would drive recklessly with me in the car and almost got us killed a couple of times. He would smoke with me in the car with one window cracked an inch. He did that for years and told me not to tell my mom. I'm pretty sure it caused my asthma and I get severe lung infections easily. He convinced me to take a high dose of Adderall when I was 13. I had no medical reason to. He's also tried to convince me to drink and smoke pot but I learned to stand up for myself after the Adderall incident. He has bipolar disorder and when manic he'll randomly get really angry with me. He's sent me texts out of the blue that if I don't do something he's going to be pissed. He also has kicked me once and my brother once. When I was in elementary school I had severe insomnia and would try to sleep in my parent's bed. One night I just remember getting kicked in the face by my dad so hard that I was almost crying. I'm not entirely sure if it was intentional though. He kicked my little brother in the chest so hard my mom thought his ribs were broken. That was because he was being annoying. If he did that to my brother I imagine he might've intentionally kicked me. 

My mom has changed so much and is a lot better mother now. When I was younger though she was very controlling. She always checked my phone and was very against me talking to guys even though I was getting older. She wouldn't let me shave my legs until I was 13. She would overreact to everything and I was terrified of telling her things. When my period started I tried to hide it for the first few days but when she found out she was upset. It was like she was angry with me for getting older. Things have changed and are a lot better now, thankfully.

I stopped my Amoxicillin because my gut bacteria is screwed up bad.

On paper this seems funny this is not funny it's embarrassing. My bowels smell super foul after eating healthy. It's cleaning out the garbage I put in day in and day out. 

My meds has been making me outspoken. Yesterday was bad too? This lady was joking around at work she was like what's wrong you aren't eating today you trying to lose weight? I blurted our who the fuck asked you.

I don’t want to apply for a job that I don’t want to do. I honestly feel like I’ll resent it even more. 

I’ve had a few interviews and the feeling that I’ve had when I’ve been advised that I’m unsuccessful is beyond shattering. I’m just a shell of a man who has lost his identity.

148,"I am in the United States. This is a throwaway account.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a university student. My grades swing wildly between A's and F's without rhyme or reason. I am a compulsive procrastinator. Everyone tells me I'm smart and everything is easy but at the same time hard because it's so boring and I'm so lazy. I am at a shit school that thinks it's a good school but gives shit assignments that are just arbitrary hoops to jump through that don't teach you anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I seriously feel I would do better at Oxbridge or some shit where shit is legit challenging but that feels narcissistic to say. I think people just think I'm smart because I have a high vocabulary and know how to fake sounding like I know what I talk about, and I have stereotypical smart people interests like philosophy and politics and shit. I don't know if I'm actually smart. I think I've predicated my entire sense of self-worth on being smart because when you're a skinny unathletic white dude kindergarten teachers for years start telling you you're a little fucking einstien or some shit, especially if you can write.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like an imposter, like I don't deserve to be in school at all, but also like an imposter, like ""this place is beneath me, I should be somewhere better, doing hard assignments."" But that's a privileged, entitled attitude, and I DON'T EVEN DO THESE OSTENSIBLY EASY ASSIGNMENTS

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I have not been treated for either of my mental health issues for a while. I was on escitalopram for a while but that was years ago. In the case of both my depression and my ADHD, the doctor was like, ""Yeah, you have this, but just barely."" So I feel guilty complaining about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry if I am taking up space here that should be for people with more serious problems. I just found out that I did a very shit job at an assignment I thought was very easy and did not put much thought into. My boss has all but threatened to fire me. And it was a basic ass shit task.

&amp;#x200B;

I can function but only with ungodly amounts of caffeine and I love my wife so much but sometimes I want to die, not enough to hurt myself but enough that if I died in a freak accident I'd be okay with it. But I feel selfish because I know that would hurt her.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that's why I'm posting here. I know mentally healthy people shouldn't think that way, so I guess that's how I know I need help.

&amp;#x200B;

But like, what do I deal with first, the ADHD or the depression? Can you get pills for both? do they interact? Will they just think I'm some dumbass who wants study drugs because I'm lazy and feel entitled to better grades that I don't deserve? Fucking hell fuck fuck fuck fuck.
