0,"(Background: I am known to have a problem with Savior Complex as well as having awful experiences and luck in life. I reside in North America and I have gone to therapy.)

I'm having some trouble with what I should do with my life. I was wondering if anyone can kinda give some opinions or ideas on what to do. Here are some things I've been going through:

1. My Best Friend (and Crush) started dating someone else. I would normally not be affected by this at all, but a few years back I confessed that I had a crush on her. I had gotten rejected because I had bad timing and that she only wanted me as a friend, even though I am always doing favors for her and ""saving her life"". We recently became best friends and yet we never really talk to each other like we used to. I really miss her and it hurts my heart every time I wake up and it changes the way I view the world. I tried everything I could to show how much I love and care for her: jewelry, gifts, kindness, and always being there for her no matter what and all I've gotten back was almost nothing but a hug on a rare occasion. I feel like I wasted my life on someone who doesn't care and will never even care so long as I live.
2. I am part of a competition group that normally doesn't stress me out. However, we had added a new generation to the group and for the most part they don't cause stress except for one person in particular. I decided to help this person out regardless. However, this person believes that he has privilege in the group and has generated a lot of conflict. I am one of the founders of the group, but we are not allowed to remove members with a unanimous vote. This person is someone I had saved from an abusive household situation, excessive abuse of substances, and other  scenarios. And yet, my efforts are nothing as it hasn't changed who he is and when he will take responsibility.
3. Before joining Reddit, I was a sort of consultant when it came to mental breakdowns. I have lost some people along the way from suicide and while I know it wasn't my fault, I could have done something else to prevent these incidents. I continued to help people with mental illnesses and sadness afterwards so prevent life threatening situations like these again, thus adding more stress.
4. The friends I have are always busy on their own lives that I am alone in my own darkness that says that I am worthless to the world and that no one will ever care or love me. While my friends and crush and family disagree, my mind is so fixed on this ""truth"" that I just accept the pain life hands me, regardless if I'm ready or not.

To be honest, the only reason I am still alive is because I know I can help people and I haven't figured out a way to stop existing without me dying. I want to simply disappear from all of time so that no one will ever remember the good I did for them and they will not cry for my passing. However, this would be a lot more difficult and I am stuck here.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like a normal person. I don't relate to anyone. I am always left alone. I am always in Darkness, yet I give people the light they need to progress. I am scared. I am sad. I am alone. Please help...

Thanks In Advance.",18Mar2019,1
1,"A couple of hours ago I was sitting on the floor of my shower curled up in a ball rubbing my hair and covering my ears. It's foggy and I barely remember what I was thinking about but basically I was telling myself ""you're weird"" and ""stop thinking i'm weird and live your life."" This is because for the past few months I've been constantly thinking ""that's wierd"" whenever I do anything. I call myself weird for the way I walk, way I put shampoo in my hair, brush my teeth, or sit as I type this. I hate it because I can't get the thought out of my head. Is this a symptom of anxiety or depression, or something else?",18Mar2019,1
2,"You’ve probably seen a lot of people’s stories here. So why read about mine? I’m not sure. My name is Chris, and I’m 20 years old. Growing up I was different from the other kids. I got bullied and molded into what other people saw of me. I was picked on for my looks, height, interests and so on. At the time I didn’t realize what was happening, but now I’m realizing that it was pretty damaging. I’ve never been in a relationship because I was lead to believe by other people that I’m too ugly for a girl to like me. During my junior year of high school I learned several things about my life. After 22 years of marriage my parents started off January 1st 2015 by telling my brother and me they were getting divorced. I was in denial from this for a long time and there’s still some loose ends that I need to tie up. Around that same time I found out I was sick for most of my life and I didn’t even know it . I got diagnosed with PANs/PANDAS. A pediatric neurological disorder associated with strep infections. So as a kid when I had strep throat, it evolved into a neurological thing that caused my immune system to attack parts of my brain, changing my behavior and giving me my anxiety and depression. I saw countless doctors and had electrodes on my head too many times. During this time I was taking a class in high school about astronomy. It changed my view of the world for the better. Looking out to space through a telescope with your own eyes is nothing like I’ve ever experienced before. Everyone knows what the moon looks like, but to see it with your own eyes is completely different. 

Fast forward to today, I’m still working on my anxiety and depression. Trying to boost my confidence and self worth. Focusing on hobbies like; astronomy, photography, music, meditation and yoga. I’m doing my best I can and seeking some extra help from my therapist. I’m trying. That’s all any of us really can do. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far, I appreciate it and you. ",18Mar2019,15
3,Okay so I know this sounds absurd but I used to always think this like my teddy bears or dolls had a life force or feelings I guess you could say. And just now I had that same feeling. I mean I'm a grown woman now with kids of my own and I don't have dolls or stuffed toys of my own. But the babies have been given them as gifts since they were born and recently they both received these two identical turtles that have up until last night been out on display in their bedroom. Well they are being played with now. So they are going into the toy bucket with the rest of the toys and just now as I was throwing the stuffed turtle in with the rest of the toys I felt like it was sad. I know that sounds totally crazy. And I don't truelly believe it's alive but I tend to connect a feeling or emotion to every physical thing I come across. Is this normal? Maybe it's just me projecting I don't know or the kid in me perhaps. ,18Mar2019,20

6,"So I don’t really feel happy ever, it’s like the receptors for ”feel good” hormones in my head are just gone. I enjoy nothing and I’m not excited for anything, I have no motivation and don’t feel much towards people either. It’s been like this for a couple of years at least but I think it’s only gotten worse with time. People have said that I should try to deal with any hidden away emotions but I have no clue how to do that.

8,"Recently my body started to almost freak out due to lack of stimulation when I'm trying to fall asleep. It started almost out of nowhere, one night I couldn't sleep for almost 3 hours because my limbs were touching. I wanted to shoot myself I swear to God (not to the point I'd do it but I definitely wished I could at least be knocked out).

I've never really had any real issues with sensory overload, now I can't sleep well at night because I either need to pee or my body parts are touching each other. It causes a stupidly large amount of distress and makes me want to self harm.

9,"Hello World,
     It’s been a while. I know that I committed to posting on a regular basis when I created this blog, but life has been very tumultuous as of late. Hopefullly things will calm down soon.
     In my last post (12/5/18) I had posted that I had to leave work because of my anxiety. Unfortunately that resulted in my termination from my former job. When I was working at BriovaRx I was unsatisfied after two and a half years of employment. I was informed of an new opportunity with an up and coming company called PharmaCord. At first I felt like it was going to be a great fit and a switch that would result in a much happier work experience. Unfortunately after being there for a while I realized that the company was sorely mismanaged and had no clear sense of direction. I became extremely unsatisfied and due to the work environment that was created I suffered from extreme anxiety that affected my stability. Things quickly went downhill and like I said above I was terminated. 
     My being fired ultimately resulted in three months of unemployment. I struggled very badly with depression and my sense of purpose. It also took a major toll on my marriage. I am not equipped to be a house husband. While things began to become more and more rocky I had to do a lot of soul searching and self evaluation. Even more so, I learned what is important to me.
     Even at this point there is a large part of the story that is missing. Like I have said in previous posts, I have been guilty of being unfaithful in my marriage. This is and will always be something that I am deeply ashamed of. However, this led to unfortunate circumstances. On the same day that I was fired from PharmaCord over the phone, I learned that I had contracted HIV during my periods of infidelity. As an adult gay man who has always been very familiar and comfortable surrounding HIV (I had even been in relationships with those who are positive), I had always assumed that if I were to acquire it I would not be affected in an extreme negative way. Unfortunately I did not find that to be the case.
     I remember standing with David and revealing the results of my OraQuik test. I immediately burst into tears. It was much harder than I ever thought it would be. Being the amazing man that he is, David was extremely comforting and did everything he could to help the situation. That is a day that I will remember until the day I die. David has been tested many times since and luckily remains negative. It turns out that we caught it very early, and achieving an undetectable status was not difficult for me. 
     Now things are looking up. I found a new job that is much better suited for me and that makes me very happy. My marriage is once again improving and things are looking up.
     I am so grateful for the amazing man that my husband is, and for his continued love and support. It’s only up from here! More to come soon!

11,"Hi everyone, I hope you’re all doing okay. I’m an 18 year old studying abroad (first year), and everything’s going pretty smooth in my life. I’ve always struggled with anxiety, and I think it’s pretty bad. I don’t get anxious as frequently anymore, but my whole life revolves around how anxious I feel. I usually can’t eat most of the time because of how anxious I get. I’m currently studying in the UK, and my anxiety lessened quite a bit a few months after moving abroad, which made me feel great. I’m now back home for a two week holiday, and on the second night (about 24 hours ago), I started bawling my eyes out for the most irrational reasons. Bear in mind, I’m an unusually large, hairy and manly guy and I’ve always been proud of my mental fortitude. But these past few months have been pretty bad for me mentally.

 I attribute the worsening of my mental health to a few things. I’m an Arab, but I can’t speak Arabic fluently at all. I don’t even think I can have a full conversation in Arabic. I never could. I’ve always felt like I would never be able to integrate myself into my culture, and 18 years on, I still can’t. I also really dislike how most people in my country refuse to take other opinions or beliefs seriously. I have drastically different views on religion, and I’ll never be accepted if I reveal my beliefs (or lack thereof ) and will probably be ostracized by most. In the UK or US or wherever I’ll land in the future, I’ll never be able to totally fit in. I feel like I’m some ugly duckling that won’t fit in anywhere. 

The second reason is that I honestly never found a reason to live. There just isn’t very much pleasure to be had or reason to continue. I’ve been told to “cherish the little things in life”, but then what? Yes, I do enjoy hanging out with friends and family, and I absolutely do cherish every moment of it, but that doesn’t last forever. I’ll be alone again, which is totally fine, but I’ll inevitably have another bout of deep sadness. I know I study abroad and I was lucky enough to have been awarded scholarship, but I honestly think that none of this effort is worth the trouble that life is. The only reason I go on is for my mother. I absolutely love her, and I do not think I’d be able to live without her. I do not know where life will take me, and if feeling better is even possible for me. Whether I die happily or die terribly depressed, I do not know. I don’t want to feel this way anymore and I’d love any advice. My mother isn’t aware of how I feel, should I tell her? Would therapy help at all?
Thank you all :)",18Mar2019,1
12,"Lately I've been feeling very tired and just kind of disconnected from my surroundings. It's not so bad when I'm out with people and socializing, but more like I'm at home and I feel like time is passing by really fast and I'm not really experiencing much even though I'm physically here. It's almost like I'm numb at times. 

I honestly don't know if this is normal, but I don't feel sad or unsatisfied in any way. Just kind of distant. Just wondering if anyone has felt this way before and things that may help?",18Mar2019,7

14,"Two weeks ago a close friend but not one I saw too often took his life. I have had a lot of loss in my life including my dad when I was 19 (now 29), my grandma, uncle, and ex boyfriend (to an overdose). But this friend of mine passing 2 weeks ago has affected me more than any other loss. 

I have heard from many people that those who have a plan to kill themselves often show no signs of sadness or depression.. bc they have found peace in the idea of no longer existing.. i have been doing social work for 4 years and have learned a lot about mental health in that time.. with my clients, I can better understand what causes the depression/anxiety and it usually correlates to years of trauma.

This person however did not seem (in the 5 years I knew him) like he had this affliction. He was in fact full of life and constantly looking for adventures. He was both artistic and technical, but I believe his best quality was that he wore his heart on his sleeve and had so much love to give the world. He was always present during conversations and I got the sense that he was truly listening when we talked. He sang opera, played the piano beautifully, snow boarded, surfed, and would try just about anything. I know a lot can be hidden under the surface and people are complex, but I cannot help feeling confused, sad , and just downright upset. That such a light in the world felt so much darkness. 

I am in therapy right now and have good friends that I’m grateful for. Life is truly precious. Thank you for reading,, I hope that if you have gone Through something similar your hanging in there.

She came this year to join me at school and was overly optimistic about everything. Fast forward to now, she hates her roommate, her sorority, her major/classes, her “friends” and I’m pretty much the only thing she has left.  
  
She is diagnosed with depression and bi-polar disorder and takes medication (this is like her 3rd different one) and it seems like the longer she gets into school, the worse it gets. I, personally, am enjoying school and have never experienced the difficulties she faces on a daily basis and have no idea how to help her as time goes by.  

She goes to a therapist/psychiatrist very infrequently and feels like they don’t help at all, especially since it’s usually every 2-3 months or so. She hates it when I talk to her parents/sister about it and I just kind of feel helpless in the whole situation regarding this portion of her life. 
  
Basically, I just want to know what I can do to help her. Is it normal for therapy appointments to be this infrequent? She is under the impression that the health center at our school is terrible and their mental health resources will lead to nothing, and doesn’t want to change her major because she’s studying what she loves even though her grades have been suffering. I’m just kind of lost on what I can do to help her and any help/resources will be appreciated.

I’ve always had a rough time, going through cycles of depression through the year but no one ever mentioned that it could be a slow cycling bipolar disorder. Until Friday.

I said no and she kept asking me questions but didn’t ever actually decide anything.

I’m not perfect, but I am genuinely happy when I look at myself in the mirror. This is huge for me, as I struggled with a lot throughout my life with how I viewed myself and my self worth.  What dawned on me is that now that I officially turned 21, I feel happy and free, but also confused and lonely at the same time. I have a “real adult” job while still in college (down to the end of it), and I know my goals and aspirations for the future. But the unknown of what’s to come in life is what scares me. Who I’m going to end up with, what path exactly my career is going to take, people I’ll meet, etc. This is what keeps me up at night. Anyone else feel this way? I know your 20s is when you discover yourself, and I know I am just really starting to. 

I guess late night thoughts is what gets the best of me?",18Mar2019,1
36,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to act like I'm having a pity party. So, if it sounds like it fill free to just say so.

&amp;#x200B;

But I have been really struggling with myself lately. I am a college senior about to graduate in a couple weeks and I feel like my life is falling apart. I still live at home and commute to save a ton of money. But I feel like with everyone in my life that I am just that guy pushed to the wall. There have been various times in my life where the joke between friends, non-friends, or anybody around can be about how unflattering I am. ""You say stupid things"" or things in that nature. It all started in high school when basically I was the joke. I was fine because I knew they were joking. Know and know it feels like the slightest thing that make me feel horrific about myself. I personally take myself out of certain situations so I don't have to deal with some people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely give eye contact and I pretend to act happy and silly to mask all of my insecurities.  I've tried to talk about this before and people just think I am trying to feel bad about myself and just trying to gain something. And now with college all about down and now I'm trying to go away to find a job and all I get is denied, denied, denied. So, I am just feeling that there is something wrong with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always try to be the nice, good guy. The person that tries to treat everyone with respect and be that person that people can go to if they need something. But I never get anything in return. It's hard to make friends because I have never had something want to do something I like and I'm stuck trying to enjoy something that they like. And as you can tell, the dating scene has been the same. All I have been told is that I'm a great guy and then pushed off to the side.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to help me, I was bawling my eyes out today and need to figure out something. Depression? Anxiety? Lonely? Just a baby? Suck up? Please anything helps and is appreciated.

TLDR: Cousin got mad at me for taking medication for my depression and anxiety. 

So I guess I just need to vent about something that happened while visiting family. I will start by saying I’m a grown adult at the age of 27 and I currently feel like I’m emotionally back in high school. 


Some back story on myself is I have had diagnosed depression and anxiety since the age of 12. It was always something my extended family knew, but no one talked about it. I had a really rough high school experience due to my mental health which is a story for another day. I stopped counseling and medication my sophomore year of college to see if I could do it and I was genuinely ok. It’s not like everything was always better but I was coping and felt under control. Recently I have been extremely anxious and depressed, I decided in January I needed help. I have been going to counseling and have been taking some medication to help. I’ve been trying to own my journey by normalizing it in my daily life. I am very lucky and have a great counselor who gets me and thinks this could help. My husband is very supportive so that was a great first step to sharing what I am going through with someone close to me. 

Something happened this past weekend which led me to post here. I shared with my favorite person and cousin that I was getting some help and started a medication routine. She flipped out and yelled at me. I was so thrown off I cried in public. 

I am sad and ashamed at the way I reacted to her response. Never in my dreams did I think she would be so upset with me for trying to get better. 

I’m fully aware other people have gotten this reaction before but I didn’t expect it from her. If you read this far thank you for letting me get my feelings out there.

She says she's always been ""a parent"" but she's never really been a mom... whenever I have a problem, she says it's my fault, I'm looking for excuses, it's just my mindset. When she was pregnant with me, she went skiing and fell on her stomach. I approached her about this and she said ""what, you think cuz I fell on my stomach you have brain damage? You're just looking for excuses"" as if I haven't been hurting my entire life. Whenever I'm sad, she always asks why I didn't just do ""said thing"" like it's always so easy and obvious. She even said I'm lying about being suicidal because I ""said I was over it"" which may have been true at the time, but it's come back and she just dismisses it like everything else... I'm sad, and I'm heartbroken... I don't know what to do. I am seeing a therapist tomorrow, and I'll tell her all this as well. But as for long term, I just don't know what to do... I don't think I can live around her any longer. But I can't just move... and I have a life here... does anyone have any advice or help they could possibly give me? I need help...

40,"You know that last minute panic when you know you have a deadline due and if you don't do it right now it won't be done on time? I don't get that anymore and boy do I miss it. 

I've always been a last minute person, a bad habit I know but still. For years I did homework very last minute and relied on that last minute rush to help me plough through and concentrate but at some point, I'm not sure when, it just stopped. I think it was in yr 10 before GCSEs when I just couldn't bring myself to care enough to stress anymore.

Like I still get stressed but it's not at all as intense and it doesn't help me focus at all which is an on going struggle for me. It is really worrying how little I stress and it's very frustrating. There have been times where I've had very important deadlines due the next day and I still can't bring myself to stress all that much. Hell as I'm typing this I've got a uni deadline due in tomorrow that I haven't even started and I'm still not that bothered. 

It's like I used up all the stress I had and now I'm desensitized and all I'm left with is this low-key underlying worry instead which isn't at all motivating. 

So I guess what I'm asking is, is this normal? I don't even know if this is a mental health thing or what. It's not like I can't get stressed about other things GOD knows I can but it's just impossible for school work. Any thoughts or advice would be thoroughly appreciated thanks.",18Mar2019,2
41,"Hi everyone, first time posting, so apologies for length
Some context:
A few years ago, I was diagnosed with panic disorder with severe agoraphobia. The agoraphobia has had ebbs and flows. Some days, I can go out and have no problems, other times, I don’t leave the house for weeks at a time
About 3 years ago, I ended up getting a cat named Crinkle. She’s been a huge emotional comfort to me. She’s actually so empathic, she’s picked up on when I am experiencing suicidal tendencies, sit on my lap and just not leave until I calm down. She’s really helped a lot in stabilizing my mood swings between when I’m having a depressive mood and when I’m having panic attacks. I think it’s because she came from a bad home (she has crinkled ears because of it), but that’s a different story.
She’s actually so smart, it took about a month of training from when we brought her home for her to be comfortable walking out on a harness and leash. This brings me to why I’m writing. My agoraphobia has recently gotten so bad that I cannot leave the house without either my wife or my cat coming with me. I’m hoping to try and train Crinkle to have a more active role in my rehabilitation by having her go out with me everyday. She’s already picked up on that and is quite happy to go outside with me.
My question is this: what sort of training can I give her to help her be a more effective service animal? I don’t intend for her to walk with me into buildings, my wife has been kind enough to help me with that. I just want to be able to enjoy walking outside again
AFTERTHOUGHT: before anyone suggests medication, please understand that I cannot take it. I have an extremely low tolerance for drugs and alcohol, and the side effects are even more debilitating than my illness. I’ve had seizures, extreme lethargy, increased suicidal tendencies, rampant paranoia etc when I take medication. It never ends well.
Thanks for listening...",18Mar2019,2
43,"Hi Reddit. I'm from Vancouver BC, Canada.

I (34) have an older sibling (38) who is still living with my parents. They have tried to get her to move out before, but they can't reason with her. (Logic doesn't work)  I think she's a bi-polar schizophrenic. She has no concept of personal space and is paranoid that people are talking about her behind her back.  She's quite possessive of my mom, and she hates my dad. She's also been increasingly aggressive and emotionally abusive towards my parents, who are in their late sixties now. I'm concerned with their safety and stress levels; even when I'm around her for short periods my fight or flight response gets triggered. My adrenaline is still going and I left their place an hour ago.

They have had to call the police on her on multiple occasions when she gets too aggressive or doesn't take her medication, which usually results in a 1-2 week hospital stay in the psych ward. However, provincial laws state that no one can force an adult to take their medication, so once they let her out we're back to square one. These episodes usually happen when she stops taking her medication. I'm also having a hard time finding empathy for someone who is so toxic. (Yes, I realize it's an illness but it doesn't make it any easier) My parents have had to deal with this for 20 years, and enough is enough. She doesn't pay for rent, bills, or groceries; it doesn't help that my parents are still recovering from a bankruptcy filing.

I guess my question is this: What are my options? Is there any kind of support for this kind of thing in BC? My parents are reluctant to kick her out of the house because she'll end up on the street. How can they get her to move out when she can't support herself, can't reason, and can't integrate with society? 

Maybe I'm a shitty person, but I want her out of my parents'. I'm more concerned with their peace of mind and quality of life at this point.

44,"I've been struggling with low self-esteem and some anxiety for the past few years. I feel stagnant in life. I've thought about therapy for a while, but I'm 16 so my parents would have to know.

45,"Sometimes I get lucid and grounded enough that I am able to briefly suck it up and force myself to do something that is psychological torture for me -- I seek professional help.

I have been to half a dozen doctors and therapists and every time, it is SO HARD to go there and face the judgment and stigma still associated with mental health issues. I can't describe what my mind is doing. I can't focus. I can't get my shit together enough to even coherently tell someone what is going on with me. But I try. I practice, and I try as hard as I can, and I pay my copay, and I leave WITH NOTHING. Sometimes they want a follow-up later or something, but what they don't understand is how hard it was to even come this once. I can't do it again. 

And then a few years later, I finally get to the point where I can do it again.

And the same thing happens.

And I never get anywhere.

I want to be normal. I want a job. I want to not feel helpless. I want to not be hopeless. I want to not feel like a fish out of water in every aspect of my life as an American. Maybe get some passion or ambition or racism so I fit in at all. So far in my life, there has been no place in human cultures that is appealing at all to me. I feel like there is absolutely nothing worth waking up for or fighting for or caring about. It is all just nothing. Aggressively worthless nothing. 

Briefly, over the past decade, it seemed like mental health care was going to be better. 

My mother told me when I was growing up to NEVER let a doctor think I am depressed because they'll put me on a federal list and monitor me for the rest of my life. I kind of thought that was bullshit until I went to a doctor and the doctor told me they weren't going to diagnose me with depression because then I would be on a federal list and the government would monitor me for the rest of my life. 

So then years passed before it looked like the stigma was going to be stripped away. Then I went to a doctor again. And nothing. And now that society has regressed back 70 years, it's as likely as not that a doctor will just dismiss me as a whiny snowflake. Especially since now I am unemployed and my healthcare is covered by a medical card. I don't WANT to live this way. I WANT help.

This may all seem non-sequitur to the post title, but it really isn't. I wish I could just send this post and maybe a form with my personal details to somebody and they would say go pick up my prescription at CVS. My problem is my brain. My problem is I can't function. If I had my shit together enough to fight for mental health care, maybe I wouldn't need mental health care. But I CAN'T. I don't understand why I have to overcome the illness I'm seeking treatment for in order to get treatment for the illness. 

I wish I just could magically have a pill that would at least let me get control over my brain enough to get my life worked out. I wouldn't necessarily have to be on it forever. I don't know. All I know is I have tried for decades to just push through it and get over it, and it doesn't seem like that approach is ever going to work.

46,"I've been going to therapy for nine months now, after taking a break for about ten years. I've always held low self esteem, and with my home and school like, I felt like I was a screw up, I was broken, I thought at times that being happy was selfish and I was meant to be sad. Depression and anxiety has held on to me my entire like.

I would tell my therapist I would have these thoughts pop up from people from my past saying how fucked up or screwed up I was, either I would agree with the voices or try to distract myself, more times then not, I would agree though my thoughts.

Medication has helped with some of my issues, but not the thoughts. My therapist suggested talking back to the voices, I wouldn't think it would work, I did talk back to the voices when it did occur, but I felt it wasn't working. Then one night something happened.

It was that time of the year we moved our clocks forward and lose an hour (unless you live in Arizona). I had an exhausting week of work with little sleep and no overtime pay :( . I was at the point my mind was ready to shut down, it was hard open my eyes, I can hear only my ceiling fan running and my sound of my breath. I could start to feel myself slowing moving into the beginning stages of sleep. My mind was blank, no energy to think, just enough to talk. 

Me: Your just a Fuck up!

My mind had a few seconds left of juice before my brain would start blinking, asking to be plug in with that charger that only works if you hold the wire at a certain angle. The last few moments I just had enough energy to say something.

Me: No your not.

Mysterious, that 1% of battery life in my brain went to 50% and I woke up. 

""Did I just say that?"" 

I had to think about that, it was never in my character to disagree with the negative thoughts in my brain. Yet I did, it was instinct to say I was a fuck up, now I'm beginning to naturally say that I'm not. I fell asleep an hour later, and woke up close to noon.

I did my normal Sunday tasks of playing video games in my underwear, doing the bare minimum of cleaning my room, sneaking out the dishes that built up in the room that week and hope nobody notices that I had all the cups and spoons so I can eat that cheap ice cream and not the expensive one I looked forward to having but they didn't pay me overtime...Anyway.

All I can think about was that moment in the middle of the night of accepting that I'm not a fuck up, I have been though over 30 years of pain and one week of the worst experience of my life. And now I'm beginning to accept I'm not a screw up, I'm a good person, who has good things in life. I cried because I can think positive things about myself, it was such a rare thing to feel good about me.

I walked in at the end of the week when I meet my therapist and told her about what happen, she was so exited for me. I left that appointment so happy, I wanted to shout it out to the world. Nothing can bring down form the high I was feeling.

Then I looked at my paycheck and they didn't pay me for overtime. Well, it was fun while it lasted.

TL:DR - Always thought of myself as a fuck up, therapist suggested talking to the voices and say your not a fuck up, about to fall asleep and said I was a fuck up, then a moment later said I was not. Feeling better about myself, I didn't get my OT pay.",18Mar2019,14
47,"Hey, so I know it's late (for me) and because of that a lot of folks won't see this, but that doesn't really matter to me. I kinda just wanted to get my thoughts down so I can look at them and read them. I would appreciate advice or something, but that's not necessary and don't feel obliged to do so. This might be deleted by the morning.

For further context, I am a 17-year-old guy from Canada.

Anyways, here it goes: I think I feel sad all the time. I say ""I think"" because I'm not really sure what it is, I just know it doesn't feel good. If anything it feels more like ""nothing"". I feel dull, and empty, and just all around blank. I've sort of learned to deal with this and just brush it off when I'm around people, but when I'm alone I scare myself. I've picked up some bad habits here and there over the past few years but dropped them after a while. This includes drinking, smoking cigarettes and recently vaping (not vaping to be cool, just for the head buzz it gives me). I don't know if addiction runs in my family because my mom was adopted and my father left the picture before I was even born. Sometimes I just feel the need to not feel empty, to feel at least something. 

It's not like I'm constantly sad 24/7. I still laugh with my friends and smile with them, I a enjoy my passions like piano and guitar, but whenever I'm not doing anything it's like my brain suddenly realizes it's sad. I mean if I was depressed I would be sad no matter what right? Maybe I just forget about my emotions when I'm doing stuff? I'm not sure. I don't really talk about how I feel with my friends even though they really care about me. I'm always happy to help them when they need me, but I just can't bring myself to talk about my emotions or problems with them. Perhaps this stems from my childhood, where I never had anyone to really talk to. My mom had to work a lot to support us, my friends were just pure assholes to me and thought emotions made you weak, no father figure to teach me how to toughen up, etc etc. Occasionally I just cry. There was one evening where I sat in the dark, ate my dinner, put the plate down, and then just cried for 30 minutes. I had no reason to cry, and that made me feel weak so I cried more. 

I also lack the motivation to do basically anything. I'm known to have a sort of laissez-faire attitude, but really my chillness comes from my lack of giving a shit. I used to not do homework because I just didn't care at all. I have future plans for my life, but at the same time I don't really see them y'know? Like I look into the future and see nothing, or if anything I see sadness and loneliness.

I'm not sure if there was any narrative to that, but if you have any questions please ask. Any concerns or add-ons feel free to bring them up. Have a good night or morning and stay safe out there folks.

Goodnight.",18Mar2019,2

I’m in grad school working in Athletics as a GA. Which means I’m going to school full time while being expected to handle the responsibilities of a full time job. Which usually means working 60-90 hour weeks because I’m the only person working full time in my department.

It’s mid-term week which means I have so much work to do. I was planning on getting all of my work done over spring break, but I actually wasn’t able to do any work at all because I ended up working 90 hours because I had to fix other people’s fuck ups.

My bosses don’t care that I’m working so much. I’ve been so stressed out over the past two weeks that my sleep schedule is completely erratic. I sleep either 2 hours or 12 hours. My body is a consistent state of tired. My brain isn’t at peak functioning levels. I’m terrified I’m not going to be able to get through this week.

I have zero support system besides my parents, and my parents aren’t very helpful because they want me to hire a lawyer and sue my employer for a wage and labor case.

I know I’m going to get through it. And I know that whatever happens is going to happen. But I hate the anxiety and loneliness and stress that I have built up right now.",18Mar2019,2
52,"I don't know where to begin. I just feel broken. I have a will to live and I dream of living. I am living quite my dream now which I dreamed of before when I was still trapped in my abusive home. (I'm free of my abusive parents &amp; ex) yet I still feel trapped by the past sometimes and on the worst days (they are fewer now but still happen) I just feel completely shut down, have no energy to do anything and I just obsess about things in my head and I dream of dying. But I know I can't die, or even do anything to myself. And I haven't. But I obsess and obsess and keep obsessing.
Even when I thinking back of who I was before I was abused by my ex, I felt like I was so far away from the me who just had not experienced the abuse yet. But only it wasn't me anymore. I just have a memory of who I was, before all of it happened to me.
There has been so much process though over the years. I have slowly started to find myself again, in a whole new satisfying way. But there still comes times when I feel like I lose myself again.. still affected by the past.
When he left me alone, I was suffering. He knew my past, so he took advantage of it. And he knew I had no one but him. So he left me alone. And I hated being alone. He would never answer me until I kept confronting him. Then he'd get mad and threaten to really leave me. Which he did...
I really felt like I couldn't go on living. I began to have suicidal thoughts of death and wanting to just die, how it would've been the only thing I could do and the only thing I'd deserve.
Things got a turn for the worse when one time he traumatized me the most. I remember he told me to hurt myself. I did. He then made me learn the hard way that I must not make him disappointed or angry in any way or I would die and he would leave me. I began taking it all in and letting him make me do things for him which I was uncomfortable with doing out of the very worst fear that I'd die or he'd leave me if I don't comply. I held everything inside. I wasn't allowed to question him for anything or have a natural reaction for his mistreatment for me. I had hell of a patience for him. He trained and projected me that way. This continued for 2 more years.
He kept me up almost each night and wouldn't let me fall asleep. I had to do what he says. He has so much power over me. Like he was my God
Until it was enough. I told him I just couldn't do it anymore. Then he left.
I've always felt like I don't deserve anyone.
I've been free of him for a long time now, a few years. But the trauma has kept me awake almost each night. Even if I'm the most tired, I can't let myself rest and fall asleep. Because he never let me sleep before. But I'm supposed to be free of him now, yet I still stay awake....
I've still succeeded to live now. I've actually gotten better this year. And there's really been lots of process. These days I fall asleep around 2-3am, so it's better than 4-6am. But I still struggle to get to bed at 12-1am.. even if I feel like I can fall asleep.
Sometimes when I wake up (usually it's on days when I know I don't have to go anywhere) I feel completely different from a good day.. I feel dull, like all energy from my body has just left me and I just feel nothing. All day. Those days I avoid meeting people or talking to them because I half truthfully sometimes I feel like they don't interest me anymore. I just feel guilt if anyone sees me, even though they may not notice anything, because I push myself to act normal. Then I feel guilt ""if I'm fake"" Even though I don't really want to just push myself and it drains me.
I lost many years of my youth anyway, so it feels difficult to hold a long conversation with people sometimes. Because I haven't done it in a long time.
I do have still gone to some social gatherings almost every week. I can smile, I can be genuinely happy.
I know the reason why I'm like this is because of my past and everything I've gone through. But I really feel like I've been in a place of an unhealthy cycle that feels endless, and I feel like I can't escape it. I've grown to adapt to it and I don't know how to change it.
I obsess about death and my abusive ex.. and I really want to go back to him. but I know I can't do it.. it would only harden the grip to him and then I'm afraid I'd never recover again. but then if I'm supposed to not do it, why do I feel like I have to do it? So I just feel trapped. I'm caught up in imaginations and I just wish he would appear by my window, break in, and finally come to kill me..
Yet I still dream of living, normal and healthy. Friends and a family, love, peace and purpose. I have many dreams.. but this just feels insurmountable. I'm still here, and I wonder if I can ever get over this. I know I shouldn't be living in my past anymore... And I've really started to live and slowly head in the right direction in my life, towards the healed life that I still want to live. But if at the end of the day I always come back to struggling with this... how can I ever overcome this?
At my worst, feel like I've lost all my worth as a human being. And I feel guilty for feeling like that. I feel I just deserve to be treated wrongly. And okay this one I'm afraid to say. the bad thing is that I started to enjoy the pain, because I felt it too much all these years. So I feel like I'm still in love with my ex and the pain... It's messed up I know. Or maybe I'm really not and it's an illusion. But I feel fascinated by it. I still do desire real mutual love.. but I haven't got it and I don't know if I can still have it someday. I don't know if I can ever adapt to a normal healthy life again after been so deeply damaged since my youth.

Every time my ideas and plans hit a wall of anxiety the glass split across turning it into multiple options and paths to take and I 'm not sure which one to take so I just sit there and feel bad about myself.

I't is not my attention to be douche with the vomit of personal deets, I'm a firm believer in procuring proper heath resources like therapy and doctors which I would use more regularly if able. but for I like to write out my thoughts on Ambien before I go to bed because it is the first in the day when I feel, calm confident, and my anxity is gone so I can literally breathe!

56,"Now before anyone goes to post the suicide hotline in the comments, my lack of interest carries on to my suicidal tendencies as well. I have lost interest in school, art, music, watching my favorite YouTubers, an my future. I used to love to draw and make music on occasion now I just dont. My parents are angry at me about my grades. I'm usually a 4.0 student, but I let my math grade slip to an F and never bothered to fix it given the opportunity, it just wasn't urgent in my brain. I'm also draw comics for school newspaper, I lost interest, didn't finish before the deadlines and was booted out. People might say I'm being lazy and just very lackluster, but here's the thing... I cant watch t.v. play video games, or sit and scroll through social media without going completely restless. I WOULD use the restlessness to get school work, or get art done, however to put it simply I have no interest in doing that. I have no interest in the important or unimportant things in my life. My sense of urgency is out of whack, and Mandatory daily functions such as: more than 2 hour of human interaction or hygiene are not prevalent in my life. I dont care enough to live, and I dont care enough to die. I have no interest in killing myself because that requires being invested in planning and doing. I also think I have ADD, but I wont be taken to a phyciatrist. My mind races of all the great things I am capable of doing. I just cant do it. I really hope someone on the subreddit can hear me out because I dont want to believe I have depression, since I do have happy moments here and there, but probably less than the majority.

And yet now, I still feel abandoned. I don’t want to go into detail, but I’m aware that this is probably due to issues that I have.

Somedays, I feel like my depression and intrusive thoughts are completely under control, but other times I worry I'm spiraling. I've been pretty stable for for around 2 and a half years now.

60,"I'm not even sure if I should be posting here because I was high when it happened, and I think it happened more because I was high and not in my right state of mind than anything else. However I do suffer from a lot of anxiety daily and this was probably a long time coming. 

I just got to the mall with my friends and we hit our wax pens before going in. I have not been reacting well to wax pens lately and after this incident I'm definitely taking a break. Once we got inside I suddenly remembered the years of cautious warnings my mom has given me about how every place is unsafe. Specifically with the mall, how a shooter could appear at any moment. All I could hear in my head were her warnings and telling me what to do if there was a shooter, but being high I knew that was one thing I would definitely not be able to handle and get out of alive. I just knew I wouldn't make it.   
Suddenly it felt like I knew something horrible was about to happen, but I was the only one who knew. One of my friends mentioned how it was Saturday and all I could think was, ""Oh god, it's a Saturday night at the mall, super busy."" The fact that my friends even mentioned the day somehow weirdly confirmed to me that this shooting was going to happen today, in this mall, in a matter of mere seconds.   
I frantically started scanning everyone in the crowds for suspicious characters and places they could be hiding guns on them. Then all of these intrusive, terrifying thoughts came to me about how it feel and be like to be shot in various parts of my body. Since I was high I was better able to imagine myself in that scenario. I imagined exactly what it would be like to be in the consciousness of a person who was shot and dying. I imagined the moment of actually dying and how that would feel, especially under the influence of weed.   
At that point I was 100% sure I was going to die and it was just a matter of waiting for the shooting to happen and that was fucking **terrifying**. I cry every time I think about how I felt in that moment because it awoke such a deep and instinctual fear of being alive, and dying is something we can never have control over. I knew in that moment that I was completely helpless, that a shooting was going to happen any minute, and that it was how I was going to die. 

I had this weird tunnel vision the whole time, like the whole world in my peripheral vision was spinning and I could only make out specific details when I looked at them directly. I also felt like ""I"" was either above my body or cornered at the very top of my skull. It just felt like I was definitely not inside my own head. I was sweating everywhere but it felt like my entire body was numb and cold. 

We finally went into a store and it only got worse and I could not calm down. My friends were looking at stuff when suddenly they asked me my opinion on something and I just said, ""Dude I don't know for the past 5 minutes I've just been freaking out about where we could go if there was a shooter in here."" I tried to say it jokingly because I knew it was fucking weird, but they reacted with so much concern that it made me feel really bad about myself, like I was going crazy. I felt like everyone was looking at me. My friends asked if I wanted to sit down or leave and I just kept saying no and I don't know. I felt like I was just ruining everything and ruining their time at the mall. 

It was the most terrifying and now embarrassing moment of my life. It was actually even more terrifying than some of the traumatic situations I've been in. I feel like I made my friends mad because I ruined everyone's time and could not socialize properly with them after it happened.   
I still can't believe that happened and I don't know what to make of it or how to even go about life now, knowing that *that* type of shit could manifest itself in my own brain. Am I insane? ",18Mar2019,3
61,Does anyone else feel like there is no point to life. I get that you have to create your own meaning but it all seems so silly to me. I seriously just don’t want to be around anyone as I don’t see the point. People just aren’t for me. ,18Mar2019,6
62,"Does anybody else regret asking for help? Sometimes I feel like I would be better off had I never sought out help and have either fixed it by myself or just killed myself. I’m saying this because the “help” of mental institutions and doctors costs thousands of dollars, and really doesn’t do anything productive.

The bulk of my mental health issues are based in the fact that I’m a financial burden to my parents, being that I’m a college student in their early 20’s and “school is my job” so I really have no source of income. I literally had to quit therapy because I was less suicidal without contributing further towards financial losses. And yes, my parents remind me daily how I cost them so much money, which really makes me feel like crap.

Now, I’m known as the person with mental health issues, the person who wants to kill himself. The stares only make my mental health worse. The ridicule that “it’s all in my head” and “I can snap out of it” and “just think positive” make it worse. The fact that everybody feels like they have to walk on eggshells around me makes me think they’d be better off if I kept my mouth shut or just killed myself instead of going to therapy.",18Mar2019,17

66,"I’ve never told this story to anyone outside of people close in my life. It took me about 3 mos to tell anyone and now I either blurt the story out or spend 3 minutes repeating the same sentence. I’ve tried to type this a few times here already but I’m so scared. I’m scared somehow he’ll find it and know this is me. For that reason, my details are not going to be too specific, which I’m sorry I know that’s a stupid reason, but if you have experienced something similar and want to, please dm me. I can disclose more info. This is a throwaway account, because I fear he could somehow find this and figure it out. 

I’m a college age girl and matched and slept with this guy from tinder during a depressive episode over the summer. The day we slept together had no red flags, he said a few off putting things prior but once I met him in person I brushed them off as personality clashes. After though, his behavior became aggressive and erratic. Constantly changing from not wanting to see me again, to being angered and backtracking when I was Okay with that. (I didn’t really have any emotional or romantic attachment to him, I know I shouldn’t have slept with him please do not say that I tell myself that every day) When I tried to break off the relationship permanently things became terrifying. He told me he was going to come to my apartment (he lived somewhat far away) in the late night out of no where. He sent me pictures of his gun, some with it in his mouth. He threatened that either I video called him and watched him kill himself or he would come. He told me he was tracking me through my phone (now I realize would be impossible). I knew that if he came that night he would have killed me. I talked him down and told him we could “try again” in a few months in hope that he would lose interest. Which I know isn’t the best thing but I that moment I just wanted to stay alive. I sat up that night crying watching car lights pass my window and pray they were not him. About two days later he messaged me and said he didn’t want to see me again and blocked me. I took it as a blessing. He made a new account on the messaging app twice within the span of about 3 months after. I never opened and immediately blocked both. I constantly worry and fear what those messages say. 

The first few months after I was fine then weird things began to happen. First, I would have random, vivid flashbacks of the situation. I felt repulsed, angry, gross. I loathed the fact that I let him touch me. I berated myself for being so stupid. Whenever I think about him, or experience anything that reminds me of him I am overcome with first a sense of rage I’ve never felt before then crippling sadness and disgust. Then I got situational triggers. I sprayed the perfume I wore the day I spent with him and threw up. Anyone that looked like him would cause me to shut down. In one case I was convinced it was him and had a panic attack. I have trouble remembering faces, specifically of guys I have relationships with, but his is burned into my brain. I ruin relationships because I’m so scared he could hurt them too. I have not had a day since it happened where I don’t think about him. I lose sleep, I hate myself. I’m constantly paranoid, people scare me. I don’t want to meet new people but I yearn to be loved to prove to myself he isn’t the only one that would want me. 

I feel like I have no right to complain. Even typing this I’m reading over it thinking “oh this isn’t even that bad you’re just pathetic, people on here will hate you for acting like you experienced trauma”.  

I don’t know what I’m looking for here. Maybe just advice. I’m sorry if this is stupid.

67,"You ever get a feeling of almost like impending doom? More specifically, like nothing matters and you feel you have zero control over your life?

If I try to concentrate on it and identify the feeling exactly, it’s very hard to do. It’s not a suicidal feeling at all. More like “holy fuck, what am I doing with my life?” I also immediately lose the feeling of drive for my hobbies, and just can’t feel why I even like them, or why they even matter. 
It’s an odd feeling that I’ve had sporadically for quite some time. I even had it when I was in a relationship, but feel it’s more frequent now since we broke up like 5 years ago. I mention this because it seems to not be directly linked with my level of contentment or anything.

All my life has been is painful. Being beat for years by my brother and still being worried he'll do it again. Learning, I'm transgender and bisexual. Having extremely painful gender dysphoria that makes suicide seem like a lovely escape. Unable to get on testosterone due to my age. I still have to come out to my extended family and I'd rather fucking die. Suicidal thoughts surrounding me. Homicidal thoughts, wonderful thoughts of killing the ones who hurt me. Painfully and making them cry as I feel the joy of it not being me. Even the ones who didn't hurt me. I don't like this girl's personality. I'd want to kill her. Someone is taking too long in front of me in the checkout line. Perhaps, stabbing them to death sounds nice. Occasionally hearing and seeing things that aren't there. Shaking and clutching my body telling me the things aren't real. Having a small intrusive thought that visits every so often that it became more like a voice telling me, no screaming at me to kill myself. Kill everyone. Telling me things that aren't true. Fake lies. Believing them and isolating myself. Panicking over everything. Every tiny thing. And I'm screaming in my head how I wish I wasn't alive. Having to carry on breathing even though the loss of the ones I loved scratching at me trying to kill me. Horrible disgusting things. Bad, bad, things. Having wrong thoughts about children. Trying to tell myself, I'm not a monster but I know I am. I know I'd most likely never act on them but they are still there. Guilty. Having thoughts like that. While my friends talk about how all pedophiles should kill themselves and I agree, because I agree truly. This guilt. These disgusting thoughts.. Killing myself is what I should do. I'll be gone in under a year. Each day a problem is added to this list. The pain doesn't stop. And here is something dumb, even if I didn't have all this pain, I'd still want to kill myself. People out here are dying as all they wish is too live and I'm here wanting to kill myself to escape the pain and the fact life is boring. You wake up everyday, go to work, come home, do it again.

I could be the weird dude drawing by himself in the corner to one person and a really nice dude that spared a dollar to another.

Due to a rare case I have been in the hospital for 10 days so far as a surgical patient. Losing feeling in right arm and just had surgery for AC separation. Also losing sight in right eye... 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/b07z2f/if_successful_ill_be_1_in_14_billion_wish_me_luckAFTER

When I woke up from surgery I was naked, cold, in pain, catheter, scared, confused, and disoriented. I looked around and I was in a pitch black ward all by myself. I yelled for help and nothing. My heart rate went up very high (could see the machine) alarms went off and I passed out.

I come from a past of abuse in and out of home, bullying, getting beat up, the list goes on. PM me if you want to know more. I have been told I should write a book about my life (not a happy one).

This week I came out to some friends and mom that I am bi- sexual. Also this week I got diagnosed with severe depression and PTSD. I had mentioned standing on the edge of a bridge as just to feel what it would be like but not actually jump.

I have had suicidal thoughts since my ex and I of 6 years broke up just over a year and a half ago, but just thoughts not actions. It has been a brutal time, at one point I didn't eat for a month and lost 30 pounds in that period (3 weeks).

For some reason my traumatic experience of waking up from surgery triggered all these feelings I have suppresed and hidden for so long. I don't ever get scared but that morning I was terrified. I never had anxiety but now I have been getting very anxious and having severe panic attacks, they keep getting worse to.

I'm not scared that I will kill myself even though I have the thoughts, I'm scared of what I might do if I get a severe panic attack outside the hospital (my safe place).

A couple months ago, I don’t know exactly when but I started to get this strange itchy sensation all over my body when I would get anxious.

Im 20M at uni. Was downstairs chilling in my living room/kitchen (its one big conjoined room), when i started to begin feeling very paranoid. I had had about 3 tokes of a spliff an hour or so before this, so i reckon it started this off, (Ive cut down from weed completely due to mental issues but i decided screw it ill have a couple tokes). I was getting lots if paranoid thoughts thinking someone was there walking in to the kitchen. Like i kept seeing something move past the open doorways or hearing noises from the kitchen and turning to see nothing. As these paranoid thoughts began to take over my conscious i started to feel extremeley dissasociated. I was drifting further and further away from real life and what was around me. Everything i was hearing felt like it was far away, it was like i was looking in to the scario through a window, i was just so lost in head. After a bit of this i turned my head to search for this thing i thought i was seeing/hearing and saw this outline of this blurr person standing by the couch. It was very vivid and the first proper hallucination ive had.
This honestly freaked the shit out of me cause of the state i was in so i literally stumbled my way to my room and started shaking and sweating out alot. I felt like i was losing control of myself. Luckily that was the worst of it. After that i facetimed my girlfriend and tried to relax but was still fairly paranoid. For the rest of that evening my conscious kept drifting off to that paranoid, dissasociated realm but i fought it and got through the night. 

First time ive properly hallucinated. Not the first time ive experienced this kind of thing though. Ive had delusions before (thought my girlfriend was cheating on me), and have constant intrusive, racing thoughts with chronic anxiety and a episodes of minor depression. Have people been through something similar and how did they go about treating it? Im going to speak to my doctor again tomorrow about it and try to get a diagnosis or something.

One girl I killed came back to life and just walked around with us (like a friend, not ghost of something). Then the police took me and the mare of this dream was going to jail for a long time. I woke up and thought I was in prison for some secounds and was very relieved (very very very) when I realized it was a dream.

Example 2: Me and my friend walks on a train track and a train comes and just pretty slowly drives back and forth infront of us when we are pressed against the wall. This dream isnt so scary but it was very frustrating.

Example 3: We are in another city than our hometown and somehow I drop phone, jacket and hat. In the dream I am 100% sure that the chinese that got markets took it to sell. Turns out I was wrong. Then we call my mobile and someone answers in english (i’m from northen europe) that come to ****** (cant remember where) and ill give it to you.

I won’t go out of my way to be “bad” (unless reward outweighs any punishment or consequence), and even then I’d only consider legal consequences matter more to me than personal ones. I’ve lied, stolen, and basically if it’s something I can get away with, I see no problem in it. Despite all this, I still manage to have people in my life who love me, and I guess I don’t know if the person they see is just another part of me, or a facade that comes out around them.

Even growing up there were times when I blatantly disregarded moral boundaries. Once when I was around 16 I was watching the pastor’s kid and we found an electric fence and somehow I convinced him to see if it was on. I lifted him up but his mom caught us right before he could touch it, and she freaked out, asking me why I thought it was okay and what I was thinking. I didn’t really have an answer for her because the truth was I was just curious as to if the power was on, didn’t even think about what would have happened if he had been hurt, nor did I really care. I would have just been worried that I’d get in trouble for the act, not actually caring about the act itself. There’ve been several instances of this throughout my life, and honestly? It feels good to feel to understand myself. 

I suppose I’m just curious about outside reactions of all of this though. ",18Mar2019,2

83,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 19 years old male and I've been bored for 10 of those.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since 5th grade elementary school when people are slowly entering puberty and forming their own identities, I've thought I was a little weird, I have no particular interests in anything, I don't hold any opinions of religion/gods, I have no love/sexual desires.

Around the 6th grade I noticed I was falling behind in social activities compared to others (not to mention my studies) so I decided to just mirror whatever it is they're doing. It worked, I've had a group of friends, I was often going outside, I've had better grades and I was content with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am no longer in those days, now I'm an adult and certain things are expected of me.

Even though I've mentioned my studies improved it wasn't to an extent of getting into a top middle school and college, I finished a 3 year Middle School. I could've enrolled into a better one, I even had an option for a ""professional evaluation"" in which they would see what I was interested in and push me in that direction or give me a Direct Invitation into a School  of said profession... The problem is I didn't go to the said evaluation because I figured I'd just sleep, when days of signing up for School started we were the first generation to use the Internet and there were certain flaws (The website not refreshing/loading for hours) so I set up my list once and just ignored it. Things were fine, I even forgot I set up a list and so came the day when we had to go to our Elementary school to collect some papers for the School we managed to get into and to my surprise I've put the School I wanted to put dead last on the list as a last resort just in case, I've placed it top of the list, I was disappointed for minutes...

&amp;#x200B;

Here come the days of Middle School, Immediately I've noticed that this is not a good School. The students,the facilities everything was a bit of a shock, but as days went on I've grown used to it and again felt content so I stayed in said School until the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Now 2 years after finishing School I'm preparing to enlist into the army as I have no interest in being in the profession I've finished School for (Even though it is a decent profession and I was top of my class in it.. ).

&amp;#x200B;

Except for my daily runs I've mostly been just staying at home playing games and watching Netflix. The problem is the games I play and the shows I watch don't actually bring any lasting entertainment to me, The games I play on autopilot and the shows I basically forget what happened in after an hour or so

&amp;#x200B;

One of the reasons as to why I want to enlist is because I've never been bothered by physical activities, I like them actually so I figured it's a good step into the right direction for me. I also want to try and have a fresh start with new people, try to form my own personality and thrive for once.

&amp;#x200B;

Just like to say sorry to the people that read this, I've just had to rant somewhere and figured this is the perfect place to do it in.",18Mar2019,5

85,"I was recently diagnosed with OCD after I suspected having it for about a year, the problem is that no one seems to take OCD seriously as a disorder. OCD eats away at my ability to sleep, my ability to think and focus, sometimes I can't even look my family members in the eyes, but if I tell folks that it's because of ""OCD"" I fear being labeled as 'attention-seeking' or 'weak'. 

So, I should get to the point I realise, just needed a bit to vent out.

How do I tell people I suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder without being shut down or ignored?

I am currently unemployed, so I am doing my best to make life easier around the house by doing chores and making diner, but my unfortunate slurry of mental issues makes it difficult to even do routine self maintenance (showering, eating, brushing teeth, etc,) much less take on tasks that have been collaborative up until now. any advice on dealing with chronic exhaustion and executive dysfunction, so i can better become the househusband i want to be?",18Mar2019,3
87,"I’m tired, I’m drained, exhausted, lost, angry, happy, sad, hopeful, frustrated, disoriented, confused, broken. I feel all of this easily within the space of a few seconds. 

I had possibly my worst mental episode. I had so much unnerving anger and frustration, I was kicking and yelling, and I wanted to lose control, I wanted to break and just drop. I feel like I’m the host of some shitty demon that’s just fucking with me constantly. I’m just a shell. 

I’m so tired, of everything. I’m in pain constantly, I want to explain everything that’s happened to lead me to this point but I’m just tired of telling it. 

I’m so fucking afraid. I’m afraid of seeing a psychologist, I’m afraid of opening up and being vulnerable with someone. I wish I could just talk to my mum, or my dad. But I can’t. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to cry and scream and lose control but at the same time, I just have so much built up inside me that I just can’t bring myself to do it. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. And this feeling will fade, maybe for two days, and I will think it was just temporary and I was being ridiculous, but it comes back. It always comes back. ",18Mar2019,203
88," A little bit of background :
So I've had anxiety  for maybe 5 years or so (basically from beginning of university til now). At first it was unfamiliar and scary, I cried for no reason, I was afraid of my own brain (it just NEVER shut up) and I was unaware that my negative thinking habits (mainly about the world and how everything was so hard, rather than about myself) were shaping the way I viewed the world.

After realising the way I was thinking was causing myself and those around me pain, I began to question my own thoughts, saw a psychologist (mainly CBT), while studying neuroscience to UNDERSTAND what the heck is going on in the brain in mental illness (I am now a neuro researcher in EEG).

I know, so deeply, that meditation, practicing gratitude, slowing down and doing all these little daily things is the key. HOWEVER, after at least 2 years of attempting to make these things habits, I am finding  I literally always slip away from them.

Does have any tips to keep themself accountable to these little daily habits? Things that help remind you that it's the small steps that matter most?

I'm talking physical, practical things... I'm thinking about getting a whiteboard to start my day with gratitude... But knowing me I'll do it for like a week and then stop.

Only thing I do in my life pretty much every day is go to the gym and eat breakfast. The rest changes.
Maybe someway to fit it in there? ",18Mar2019,1

Is it just me or is that really fucking messed up?",18Mar2019,1
90,"We've been together a year and I knew she had a history of cutting early on in the relationship due to the scars (minimal but apparent). In September of last year she began to express some suicidal ideology which I attended to by helping her get an appointment at the Centre for Addictions and Mental Health in Toronto. I have no idea what she said to this psychiatrist, but not enough to elicit concern, that is for sure. My girlfriend can be very withholding and it's hard to know what is going on without dragging it out of her. The psych gave her a new SSRI, which my girlfriend didn't end up liking, and came off. The ideology/threats continued. She told me in December of last year that she recognized she needed treatment, and began ""looking"" for a therapist. That was four months ago, and no therapist. I am doubting she has made any calls. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have anxiety of my own, I've been on a host of medications but currently am seeing a psychiatrist/psychotherapist who's providing me with anxiety medication (clonazepam). A couple of times she has been noticeably anxious and I have given her 0.5mg, which entirely calms her down and even lessens the ""dark thoughts"", uplifting her mood. Sometimes she refuses the clonazepam claiming, she doesn't want to take a pill every time she is uncomfortable, like I do. This happened the last week, then she left, went home, I saw her the next day and she seemed fine. When she opened her phone in front of me I noticed she had a conversation on do not disturb. I asked her who she was silencing, and she said it was a guy who she dated very briefly a couple years ago. He's been coming into her work a lot, asking her to hangout. She's told him she has a girlfriend, and he claims he only wants friendship and we should all hangout together. I ask why she's silenced him and she says because she knows it makes me a little uncomfortable when I see his name come up, and that he was only asking when she was working next. I asked her to show me if that was all it was. She then admited that she was asking him for Ativan. This shocked me because I offered her a clonazepam, she refused it, then ten minutes after leaving my house she texted this guy asking for some. She tells me it's because she wanted ""a lot"". I didn't understand what this meant, but eventually it became clear that she wanted enough to kill herself. 

&amp;#x200B;

She claimed that she texted him in the heat of the moment, and that she was going to text him back when he responded saying nevermind. She told me not to worry, and she told me not to tell anyone, especially her mom or her friends. It's been months of this, and nothing is being rectified. I feel like an enabler, and if she does hurt herself, and I knew the whole time, I will never be able to forgive myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have location sharing (find my friends). She occasionally turns her location off, but every time she's been sitting at home, and it's proven to be nothing more than an isolation tactic. Never has she actually been anywhere sketchy. However, she texted me last night to ""check on me"", then her location went off. I texted her asking where she was and the message delivered with no response. I called, but no answer. I asked her to let me know she was safe. It was 1am by this point, she's typically awake at this time, and she usually get's up in the middle of the night and checks her phone. Now it is 8am and I still haven't heard anything. She typically wakes up early. It's likely that she's just asleep and her phone is on silent, but I am so concerned that I haven't slept. 

&amp;#x200B;

On a more selfish note, I am a neuroscience student, the work load is heavy and I also work a job. I can't be staying awake all night with anxiety, especially when I have class or a test in the morning. This is incredibly stressing. I feel like I can't focus on my own life because I am so concerned with hers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on steps I should take... I know the initial reaction is ""tell her friends"", but, they are all so self-involved, I am not convinced they would do anything. It's more likely it would piss her off, and she wouldn't trust me enough to tell me when she's going through/thinking something. ",18Mar2019,2
91,"So to make a long story short, I've had a really hard time keeping a job. I am afraid of people so when I am in a large group like whenever I get a job it's hard to keep it. I go for a few days, sometime a week or two and then I just don't want to go. 

I managed to get another job as security recently though and I really just want them to fire me already. So far I have went two days and didn't go on my third day, didn't even call in, just no showed. Today will be my fourth day and I really don't want to go. The problem with that though is I need a job. I still live with my parents and I need my own insurance since I take medication that I need to be on for epilepsy. Without insurance there's absolutely no way I can afford it.

With the two days I've gone the paycheck I will get should give me enough money to finally go see my therapist again at least once and at least get put on medicine for my depression so I can start working better on something, because right now I am at a complete stand still with my mental health.

If my financial aid gets revoked I might just fucking kill myself to cancel my tuition and academic loans.

98,"Hey everyone,

This’ll be short and to the point. 22m, no major history of drug abuse (college-level drinking, cannabis infrequently and amphetamines rarely, lsd &amp; psilocybin once each), and have had this issue once before preceding these things.

I’m finding myself unable to retain a lot of detail in the very short term. I can remember the gist of conversations I had, and I can tell you that events and conversations were had, but as far as detail goes, I’m rather... spotty. I struggle with recalling exactly where sentences or trains of thought began. Imagine you’re sitting in class, and towards the end of a slide you can’t quite recall the first pieces of information that were said, only a vague idea.

Frankly, it’s quite worrying, and isn’t really helping out the baseline anxiety that I already have. Has anyone had a similar experience?",18Mar2019,1
99,"Ive been in therapy for over 3 years now, and while success has been achieved in a sense, the fact of the matter is I am still plagued by compulsive, impairing rationalizations of sex between adults and minors.

I'm really hoping someone out there is aware of a program or system that is specifically targeted towards my issue - so far I have only found resources relating to pedophilia. While some people like to dismiss my standing by equating attraction to minors (a term which involves pubescent adolescents) to pedophilia, the fact of the matter is I dont fit this criteria, and moreover *I have worked with 2 pedophile specialists and it fundamentally did not click because my rationalizations do not align with pedophilic rationalizations* In fact, the only reason why I met with 2 specialists is because the first one felt ""Ill equipped to take on the case"" and specified that my case was ""too extensive"". He referred me to his superior, who ran the program. His superior was ridiculously incapable of getting through to me.

Another issue is that pedophile specialists more frequently work with patients required to see them, meaning that their methods essentially rely on attrition. I have never been court mandated.

 I honestly think that the failure in that program had to do with the fact that I'm young, well socialized, and take good care of myself, yet stubborn. I wasnt some virgin who was developmentally suspended; i was a whore. I didnt fit the profile of someone who caves in, but nonetheless I am always looking for someone who can ""fix"" me; alleviate the chronic stress that afflicts me because of my mental illness. Some may say that it sounds like I'm unwilling, but the fact of the matter is im just so far gone and past the point of no return that it would take very strong arguements to settle my rationalizations.


Pedophile specialists rely on the fact that pedophilia has been shown to pretty much always create a negative response for the victim, however this is not true of statutory relationships, so a pedophile can be convinced that their desires are harmful, whereas that same arguement does not have implications to my issue.

My third and current therapist specializes in sexuality (mostly trans youth). She is very understanding and open minded. But she lacks in the category of direction and long term outcome.

My issue stems from 2 particular aspects of my life.. being gay, the age of consent effectively acted as a determinant of when I was able to become sexually active. Local options in my age range were sparse, and I felt comfortable to extend my dating range higher. Because i couldnt, i spent the entire time wondering why. In the end, i didnt get the answers i was looking for. 

By that point, distress had already become a part of my life. So at this point, I think this mental illness would have eventually come about regardless of whether or not the 2nd event occurred. The second event either triggered or catalyzed the development of my current illness. 

By the time I was 18, repression had turned me into a depraved, hypersexual man. I had used copious amounts of drugs in high school and nearly failed. I do blame this behavior on sexual repression, that is what kept me nihilistic. I am still hypersexual, and it's possible that that's what's actually causing this problem, but those hypersexual compulsions take the form of rationalizing sex with underage teens.. because I wanted to have sex with adults while underage and moreover have felt justified in my confidence to have pursue such behavior, and the acceptance that I could not blame an adult if I regretted sex with them. 

Additionally, I felt like repression could hurt these teens as much as it did me, so i feel guilty for allowing others to experience it if they express a disdain for it.

Anyway, since I had become depraved and desperate to make up for lost time, a month after i graduated at 18 I began dating a 65 year old. Long story short, the relationship was abusive. He lied to me about his hiv status, his age, and while not really his fault, the amount of drinking I had to do to have sex with this man or to even socialize with him for over an hour was disturbing. He eventually sexually assaulted me.

But the thing is that I knew that if I entered a relationship with him, it would be abusive. I knew this from the first message I received from him which clearly indicated abusive behavior, but I went with it because I realized he may be able to support the depraved hedonism I was enticed by. I regard my relationship with him as being self harm. I knew what I was getting myself into. I knowingly consented to self harm. 

The impact this had on my illness was strong. Essentially, if i hadn't gotten to that level of depravity, i know with full confidence that i never would have subjected myself to that abuse. I know that i am not guilty of his deeds, but i know that I was aware of what the outcome would likely be. I do feel responsible for giving him the opportunity to do it. Driving over an hour to see him, it's not like I was oblivious to my surroundings or some sort of innocent sheep. It's not like I acted innocent around him; I was always going over there with the expectation that he'd set up an orgy and drugs would be involved. It's not like I wasnt using him.  For someone to say that I was unknowing, innocent prey fully absolved of responsibility is an insult to my humanity.

That said, I consider this illness to have been pre existing, so I dont think it is a form of PTSD stemming from his abuse.

100,"My current partner of 1 year used to be in a 2 year relationship with a polyamorous woman who was in an open marriage with his best friend. This couple had been his close friends for years and are part of his wider friendship circle and social scene.

When he ended things with her so he could start a monogamous relationship with him, she went crazy. For a few months my partner and I were discouraged from going to any events (mainly music gigs) that she might attend because his friends were worried she’d cause a scene if she saw us and maybe even punch me. We spent the first six months of our relationship feeling like outsiders from his social group and he was depressed because she was constantly complaining about him to mutual friends.

Now she’s calmed down and, along with her husband, wants to be friends with him again. I suspect she still romantically likes my partner judging from how strongly she’s reacted to what she views as rejection on his part.  If my partner opens up the lines of communication with her, it’s likely to complicate things given her past behaviour.

My partner’s open to the idea of rebuilding their friendship in baby steps (especially with her husband, who hasn’t done anything wrong) but I’m uncomfortable with it. I don’t want open myself up to a woman who has been nothing but negative, unstable and volatile. It’s likely to put a strain on our relationship. But I don’t want to stop him from doing what’s important for him because he may end up resenting me.

I decided to avoid going to events they’ll be at because it’s too stressful for me, but encouraged him to still go. When I told him this he got really upset because he wanted me to go with him so we could “face it together”. This makes me feel pressure to go along with something I’m not ready for simply to appease him. I’m also confused as to why he’s so keen on letting these toxic and negative people into our lives when they’ve recently caused a lot of heartache. He should be protecting me from friends/ex-friends of his who are likely to cause harm. Yes they have a history and he probably wants to maintain that connection, but in my eyes the risk outweighs the reward and it’s safer to avoid them as much as possible.

I will only know fight or flight when its needed. I will sit dazed until something snaps me into adrenaline mode. The only thing that deters this is working obsessively or being asleep.

 I'll sit in the car thinking of 10 different ways we could all crash and burn and picture myself crawling out of the window of some upside down mangled hunk of metal bruised, bloody and broken pinned against some died person, hoping I dont die. Not that I'm afraid of death, I blacked out and nearly died once and dont remember any of it except waking up in the hospital so I'm sort of desensitized to the idea of death, it's a slow death that I'm scared of or paralysis etc.

 It's not just cars though, its other stuff. I was with someone who was stabbed and killed about 1.5 years ago (feels like yesterday) and I'm suspicious of people. You could LITERALLY stab me in the chest totally unexpectedly, I have no clue what's going on in your f'ing head right now, you possibly psycho S.O.B.

 I am also an Army veteran.

 I dont want to be alone but people are not trustworthy. Everyone is thinking of something I dont know of. Everyone has that inner dialogue that nobody else hears. Everyone has intentions that are known only to them. How can you just trust someone? I feel like trusting other people is no different than blindly following some religion. Maybe I'm just hopeless and cynical? 

 The words coming from your mouth may not be true, they could be as fake as a floating spaghetti monster. You could be saying something kind with no honesty behind it, with a straight face. All the while you're thinking about how you're gonna get me fired from work or some shit.

106,"Hi, so I was recently prescribed mirtazapine due to difficulties falling asleep related to potential ADHD/anxiety.  I've been taking them for maybe 2 weeks now and had no actual depression beforehand, with minimal anxiety too (mainly socially).

For the past week and a half, I've been hit with a very pervasive depression and sense of everything being pointless and wanting to give in.  I've experienced severe depression before ending maybe 1.5yrs ago, and know the hallmarks of it.

Can this medication create depression where it isn't there when first beginning it?  I'm 19 and know it can induce suicidality in young people so am wondering if it is related to that.  Is it worth stopping it while I wait to speak to a doctor?

I am very impulsive and cope very poorly with depression. ",18Mar2019,1
107,"Hi all, this is a long post but please bear with me.

So last year around the summer time I had my first panic attack and it was bad.  I ended up in the ER and the waves of panic attacks lasted for couple days.  After learning that was just a panic attack, I still was so scared and anxious about the future panic attack.  At that time I thought I was going crazy and thoughts of “my life is done” “This sh*t will get me times to times” had stayed in my head for months.  

After that, I have had panic attack about once every 3-4 months.  Although I now know how to cope with it and recover faster from the attack.
I have developed a thought that I think I can’t live with the attacks constantly hit me in the future.  I don’t know what is the trigger but every panic attack I have been thru is when I was laying on bed trying to sleep, I also have a weird sensation feel in my neck/back of my head.

The problem is that I don’t consider I have any mental illness/disorder.  But it is just the thought of fearing the future attacks has been impacting me negatively and start to make me anxious when I feel a little of symptoms.

Im here to hear some advices, am I at the point that I need help, or I should just learn the live with the panic attacks and try to minimize the frequency on my own.

114,"This may be long, and hopefully I’m in the right place to post this. I’m not sure how to feel and I’m a very open person. My boyfriend of almost a year has exhibited some strange behaviors in the past while intoxicated and it kind of got swept under the rug and never talked about more than a few sentences. Like having a crazy idea about something and believing it was true- a delusion if you will. That definitely was not so and was never said and/or thought of but he insisted and caused himself to act on it because of a “look” from my family member. Made him seem like a complete different person even in the facial expressions. Anyways, he was embarrassed and we fast forward to yesterday. 

He drank some and hasn’t in a while. We get home. Things are getting hot. Im on top just making out foreplay type stuff. He’s crying. I tell him I love him and keep trying to kiss him help him play it off thinking a previous convo just got to him and in the moment was emotional about us. Not uncommon but doesn’t happen often either. He pushes me off and says he needs a minute. Goes to the bathroom. 

I decide no, we are not pushing each other away in vulnerable moments and drunk me thought he needed me. I see him staring in the mirror and then looks at me, tries to tell me to leave and give a minute I tried to reason and make him realize I’m here for him, blah blah and he says he needed a talk with himself. “Between the real me and the fake me” okay drunk words whatever. He’s emotional. I’ll give him the minute he asked for with promises we’re gonna be all good after. Still worried I stand outside the door in case he needs me. All I hear is “no. Shut up. Shut up.” And he walks out sees me there. Says I shouldn’t have heard everything and he doesn’t appreciate me doing that. 

Feeling invaded his privacy I follow through and sit in the bedroom door closed next to the bathroom as he goes back in there. Again, mumbles and the shut up situation comes back in. Says everything’s fine. He’s good. I tell him he’s worrying me and we can talk if needed. He freaks out asks me to turn on the tv that it’s too loud. I ask what’s too loud? There’s no sound just the cats bell on her collar and he’s covering his ears almost and begging me to turn on the tv cause the silence is too loud. 

We did our thing once he calmed down and initiated. I tried telling myself he was just drunk. But I’m not sure.  Especially given some of those past things and little comments not repeated again in months about how there’s something wrong and he thinks it may be anxiety. Maybe he’s scared of what I’d think and alcohol puts him in a vulnerable state with a mental illness?Any insight? ",18Mar2019,4

117,"I’ve been struggling pretty hard recently. It feels like nothing I do makes an impact whether it be meditation, how I interact with people, idk just everything. 

The loneliness is whooping my butt. It’s definitely the source of my depression. I’m fairly social but I struggle to make good friends. It seems like every time I make a group of friends they end up ditching me. I THOUGHT I finally made a real solid group of friends but I’m right back here alone.

I’ve been single for two years now. I got out of a relationship with my abusive ex-gf, and it’s been so hard to get any traction with girls. I’ve been on about 5 dates with no second ones in that time. Being single for so long (and not having sex for a while too) makes me really depressed and I don’t get why dating is so hard for me. I’m smart, funny, kind, do cool things, have great taste in music, and while I’m not the tallest guy I’m definitely good looking. The consistent rejection hurts so bad.

I feel overwhelmed since I hate my job. I freelance on the side in the industry I want to be in but I have had no motivation recently to do that work since I’m so drained by the end of the day.

I’ve been going through this stuff for 8 years and it feels like nothing makes a difference. I see my personal growth, but my reality is the same.

120,"I've spent the last several years wondering what I want to do with my life. Every single person has done this and some are still figuring it out. Everyone wants to do something they love. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It just comes easier for some than others. Being 20 years old the world may seem full of possibilities. For the longest time I have wanted to help and educate people. (I love astronomy and animals) I've always wanted to do the right thing. Growing up and seeing this society we live in today, its almost seen as if doing the right thing is wrong or stupid. I'll give an example. When people used to go out on dates, a guy would usually go up to a girl he thought was cute and ask for her number. He'd call her whenever and they would go out. Now if you were to approach a random person and start to talk to them and befriend them, most people would think you're weird. I was bullied into thinking nobody liked me and I wasn't date-able. 

&amp;#x200B;

It made me think I was pretty much worthless. Eventually I found a hobby that changed my life. Astronomy gave me a whole other perspective on life. When most kids were out at school dances or prom or whatever, I was home looking at the sky. I had started a little blog because I wanted to share pictures of things out in space. To show people what else is out there. Mostly stuff like; planets, galaxies, nebulae and stuff like that. Because to me that matters. Same goes for animals. So many people forget that we share this planet with millions of other species. I've loved animals since I was a little kid. I never played with plastic army men, I played with little plastic animals. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I go outside at night, I get a sense of peace. With how crazy and stressful this world is now, I find peace in knowing that outer space is pure and untouched. Completely natural and the way it was supposed to be. I was never one for religion, my parents are and so is the rest of my family. I'd say I've become pretty agnostic in my whole belief. For those that don't know, agnostic basically means that you believe that nothing can be known, or ever will be known, about the existence of a ""god."" I don't deny that there's something else up there, I just don't think we'll ever know. So many of our issues today come from religion and beliefs. To most people, if someone doesn't believe in the same thing they do, then they're automatically wrong. Which makes no sense. I believe that religion came from the stars and the earth itself. Humans created it. Ancient civilizations made stories about the stars and natural events. I remember hearing something that says the ancient Chinese thought comets were a sign of plague or famine.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think about so much when I stargaze. People often forget where we came from, and that we're lucky to be here. We often get stressed and overwhelmed by simple day to day things because we have made them important. Which isn't bad, but sometimes it isn't good. I've felt lost, scared, undeserving, forgotten, and many other things for a long time. I'm doing the best I can with what I've got each day to try and figure out how to make my impact. My therapist has said she believes I'm capable of doing great things and that every great person in the history books started out somewhere. Other people have told me that too, close friends and family. I'm just trying to figure out how to make it happen. I'm not quite sure I believe in myself yet, but I'm working on it. Even though I've been on this subreddit for a short while, the stories of other people I have read are inspiring and very relate-able. It just tells me that so many people are capable of doing great things. We just need to keep moving forward and treat any setback as it is, a setback. Only temporary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, thank you for reading if you got down here, I apologize that it turned into a bit of venting. I hope this may have helped in some way and know that you are never alone.

121,"I grew up in an emotionally abusive household, and my mother and younger brother always made me feel like a maid or a punching bag. I ended up becoming really sensitive and could never bring myself to hit them back for fear that they might kill me (they're unstable). Eventually I moved out.

I'm an extroverted person, but I never felt like the kind of tough male my country desired, making it hard to make male friends. Girls always wanted me for emotional support and such, but not to date. I've found my way now, but I still tend to not do too well in that department.

Also, I've been dealing with internalised homophobia and fear of being attacked as a bisexual man. Studying the social sciences in a country that values hard sciences for men is also painful.

Ultimately, its been hard to accept myself, but therapy has helped. I just hate the idea of having to hide parts of myself based on where I go. I can't find people who can connect with all of my interests or if I can there is no emotional connection, rarely both.

123,"Hey. I’m really new to Reddit (and generally sharing stuff online at all) so forgive me if I do things wrong. For context, I’ve been diagnosed with severe GAD and major depressive disorder, and I also self harm (though that term is kind of muddy in this situation, it’s more of a bodily-focused repetitive behavior as far as I can tell, but who knows). I’m a senior in high school, which has been the easiest and hardest year of at least my academic career, if not my life—easiest because I have only two academic classes with some art school things I’ve done for years, and hardest because my mental state has deteriorated so far from what it was even six months ago, let alone a year. Since I was 11 or 12 I’ve received counseling and a few years after that I started taking meds, which has been an ongoing experiment because my mental state has so many different factors (dissociation, paranoia, compulsive self-injury, sensory sensitivity, hallucinations, and more) and on top of that my body is extremely sensitive to psychotropic drugs, so I experience negative side effects quickly and often (a curse as much as a blessing).

I’ve seen two counselors, one licensed by my school and one from a local practice, for around two years or so, though I’ve seen the former for much longer as a supplement for the other. Just today the personal counselor voiced concern for my safety due to recent suicidal ideation in combination with my worsening self-injury (rather than using sharp utensils to cut into my skin, I pick and squeeze with what little nails my fingers have and subsequently ingest the contents, making us lean more in the direction of a compulsion than a desire to hurt myself; but I digress). I’ve been fortunate in having a wonderful support group around me for as long as I can remember—my family, friends, peers, teachers, counselors, and doctors are all amazing people that truly care about me and are good at what they do, and it’s been like that for my entire life—and my parents and I trust my counselor’s judgement in this regard. She suggests I should be moved into a more intensive outpatient group, actively “targeting” suicidal and self-harming intents and actions for a few times a week. Part of me is sad that I’ve reached this point of concern, but I’m honestly relieved I can get help that’s in-between CBT and a stay in the hospital. I feel like I’m a danger to myself at home—I self-injure at least twice a day, to the point that I’ve had to go to see a wound specialist to aid in healing various infections I’d contracted—and I’m hopeful that I can become stable before I start college in the fall.

This is really long-winded, and I’m sorry if it’s too much information or something. I just wanted to get that off of my chest, in a community that knows exactly how I feel. 
For those of you that have gone through this process before, do you have any tips? This is my first time in a group setting for therapy, so advice on that would be greatly appreciated. If nothing else, I’m thankful for this space for me to vent. ",18Mar2019,2

I'm 20 and a girl and haven't lived with them for almost 2 years. We went on a week long trip to Colorado and I have somehow reversed all of the progress I've made on coping and handling my emotions better in my relationship. I live in a quiet house I bought with my fiance and I've been out of control ever since I got home. Going on this trip put me in panic mode. 

Where I'd learned to talk things out rationally and at a low tone of voice, I went back to getting offended and confrontational and holding serious grudges. 

Where I'd previously been calm and kept my cool in stressful situations, I'm back to losing my mind and raising my voice to get what I want done.

Where I used to ask for help, I'm demanding it again. Or holding a grudge for my fiance not noticing or babying me. 

Where I cared about others' feelings, I've shut down again and blocked out all of the oversensitive BS. I've verbally abused my fiance just by saying things I knew would hurt him, as if I suddenly don't believe he doesn't have feelings. 

Where I used to be treated with dignity and like I meant something, where I was a valued opinion that would be heard and thought about, I was demonized and treated like I was crazy and mean for having an opinion or getting upset. 

All the trip did was reverse all of my progress and now that I'm home, I feel like where I was once yelling in a crowded room to be heard, I'm now yelling in a quiet room with no ability to stop. The depression is back full force. The manipulative tactics to get what I want are back. My fiance can't stand me like this and is ignoring me hoping I'll calm down. I'm highly emotional and out of control. He said my family was toxic when I explained everything to him. 

I just don't know what to think anymore. Is my family toxic or am I just crazy? Both?

Bad news: withdrawal symptoms are the worst

I get occasional brain zaps, intense brain fog, intrusive thoughts, and get upset over the smallest things.

I really do want to stop taking medication. It’s expensive, and I was (for a very good period of time) doing very well. It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions, starting to doubt I can do this, but then again maybe that’s just what happens when you wean off medication. This is the second time I’m doing this, first time was okay but I think mostly it was because I had a break. I’m now doing it in the middle of trying really hard to perform well at a new company I’m working at. It’s sad that my work is being affected and it’s becoming apparent to some colleagues that “there’s something off” with me.

Any advise how to cope (specifically with intrusive thoughts) will help. I feel extremely critical of myself, my mistakes, and what colleagues think of me. My anxiety isn’t as bad as when I first started seeking treatment, but it’s bad enough that I’m doubting if I should discontinue it

I used to be a straight A´s guy back in elementary/middle, when I got into high school I kinda lost my drive for the A´s, I didn´t care about them anymore. That started a downward spiral with my dad, he used to really scold me and try to get me to work since I wasn´t pulling the best I could do. This situation only got worse by the day since I don´t like giving up my stuff just to please other people, the climax of this situation came during my third year of HS, my dad came home early and saw me playing LoL, he got pissed since I wasn´t studying/doing homework and closed the laptop on my hand, took it away and then smashed it on the floor. 

I had a girlfriend back then, kinida a toxic relationship since I was in constant pain about it. I´m not going to go real deep into the deatils since I feel this is long enough. Basically all the blame of everything was mine, I was the bad one all the time and that really marked me.

Right now I´m struggling with my own beliefs, ever since I stopped pulling the A´s I kinda stopped caring about them, but right now in college I see that it is really important but it isn´t. Like, it helps but and the end of it all it comes to your skills and knowledge and all that, but grades really help. It´s been eating me slowly how I can´t pull off what I used to (not studying yet pulling a good grade, doing everything last minute and it coming A-OK, etc) but the worse of it all is that my current girlfriend has been something that kinda pisses me off.

My current girlfriend is incredible, straight A´s, really smart, beautiful, I love her a ton. But something inside me kinda gets annoyed at what she is capable off, I´m constantly comparing myself to her and I feel dumb/stupid/useless and that I have to get better; that´s all fine and dandy but it gets worse in a way I can´t really control, it gets dark. 

I don´t like that and I don´t know why it´s constantly happening, as of right now I´m looking for a therapist in my area. I really don´t know why I´m posting this but I believe it´s because I´m getting really desperate, I don´t want to hate my girlfriend just because she´s better at school than me. I really hate myself right now, it´s annoying that my ego gets the better of me every single time, i don´t like feeling inferior but I don´t like feeling like I have to be above the one I love and everyone else. 

Any advice will be well received.

Thanks for your attention.",18Mar2019,1

133,"Hi, my friend reached out to me saying she feels like she wants to die. She's been dealing with severe depression, anxiety, and panic disorder for the last 5-6 years. She is 21 and lives at home and has stopped going to therapy for the last 6 months because she cannot afford to pay for it under her current insurance plan. If anyone can recommend other inexpensive/free resources for her to seek mental health counseling that would be great. In the past she has also tried an app that connected to her a therapist that she did a few sessions with over the phone, but even that became expensive. Thank you",18Mar2019,1
134,"hi! i'm wondering if i can get some advice on my situation.

i'm prescribed some psychiatric meds to help with my conditions. these meds include lexapro for depression, buspar for anxiety, and seroquel for psychosis and insomnia.

i also have obsessive-compulsive tendencies. i hesitate to call it ocd, because i haven't been officially diagnosed despite meeting the diagnostic criteria. this makes it very difficult for me to consistently take my meds. if i miss a dose, i consider it ""ruined."" i can't bring myself to take it the next day.

this is really affecting my health--my sleep schedule is messed up, and my depression has gotten significantly worse. i KNOW the best course of action is to start taking my meds again, but i can't bring myself to.

i'm currently unable to see a therapist due to financial reasons. i live in the states, and i do have access to health insurance, but i still can't afford the co-pay. i'm also a full time student and i work part time. i'm just hoping someone who has experienced something similar could point me in the right direction.

135,"This is my first post, sorry if its not the best post you've ever looked at. But I'm really deep in a situation and I need help, and I honestly don't know what to do. Let me set it up, so on May 24th, 2018, I've met someone who would become my first girlfriend (I'm a guy btw). We ended the relationship March 6, 2019. But here's the part I need help with. Actually let me explain EVERY thing in detail before I ask for help. So during the relationship I knew that she had issues of her own, but I largely ignored those issues since I didn't see her, and I still don't see her, with those issues, meaning I never judged her or anything about anything she's dealing with. I honestly don't know what issues she has, I know this, hopefully someone can give me more information about something like this. I love her very unconditionally, she means everything to me, and despite the fact that she might be a problematic person, I never saw her as one. I saw her for her, my sweet beautiful babygirl (that was a nickname I gave her, she called me her precious boi).

Here's the things I want to mention about her, and the reason why I'm posting this is because I need answers, I need help. I want to help her, I know she needs someone. How do I be that someone for her? How can I be the person who can be there for her when she needs it the most, and how do I be the best guy I can be for her? I don't see her for her flaws. I'm not gonna be the guy who says that she doesn't have flaws. She does have flaws, which I want to state in this post. I know its very personal to her but at the same time I need help for this. The way you can see the personalities between me and her is from the show Spongebob Squarepants: I'm the Spongebob here since I'm the upbeat, optimistic one who wants to do the best for everyone, and she's the Squidward in the sense that she's pessimistic, always sees that everyone has something against her. She thinks that everyone hates her, she views the world always deals her a bad hand in life. She's also a cutter, she was cutting before meeting me, she was cutting on and off during our relationship, and now both neither me and her dad don't know if she's still a cutter. When we both got jobs at our local Jimmy Johns, she thought that all the coworkers, especially the managers, had something against her. Now she works at another job because she had to quit since she didn't receive as much hours as I had. But now at her current job, she hates it a lot. She always complain about how she's being overworked, and how she doesn't have any free time anymore, in which I will also discuss in a bit.

She also has depressive episodes, and its in which I partially believe why the breakup between me and her happened. She dropped her friends, dropped me, dropped her hobbies, and has only either gone to school, work, or just cooped up in her room all day. I want to tell her that this isn't the way how to deal with things (she has a lot of anxiety), but at the same time I don't know how to or at times if I should tell her in a different way. One thing that is needed to note for me is that I'm a straight forward person, so I want to say things straight up. But I actually have to watch and think what I say before possibly saying something wrong to her. I want to help her and to be with her again, not pushing her away, and I'll also state things from my end that I've done to contributed to this. I mean I want to be the best for her, and the 9 months we've been together were the most magical times of my life. But at the end I guess I kinda became a bit toxic to her. In January she had a late period, I mean a very late period like 4 days late (she has a tracker on her phone that tracks periods). During that time, being the straight forward person I am, I straight up told her to 'get the fuck over it, it's just a late period'. And when she had it, I really gloated about it, straight up telling her that it was nothing but a late period, I was in the 'I'm right, you're wrong' feel. Honestly I should've taken it all better to her, and I should've shown more properly that I was sorry for bring a jackass during that time. Then a week later I tried to take her out to the downtown part where I live (Aurora, IL). But I wanted to make her a special day for her by only doing what I wanted to do, and when I couldn't get my way (all the places we went to were to go places, you don't sit down and eat unless in the summer, we did this on the first of February), I screamed in the car, not at her, but out loud in the car. From there I should've known that the relationship with me and her was falling apart, and I should've done better to keep it from falling apart. BUT, I don't see this as a forever thing. Her dad still really likes me and he thinks I'm the best guy for her in the future, and she said that she still cares for me and wants me to get help during this, I am seeing a counselor right now during these times.

Again, I love her dearly, and I know that it's going to be a very hard time for both of us, especially on my end. I just want the best for her, and the best for us. Again, I don't know how to exactly fix everything, but I just gotta wait a bit and focus on me for now. I'm hoping one day that I get to make a surprise visit a few months down the road to see what's going on in her life, and to see if she's doing a bit better, and to see if she wants to be in a relationship with me again. I hope by you guys reading this, someone would be able to give me some advice, something I need to sleep on for the rest of this time period.

I've analyzed that moment, when I'm pacing back and forth in my kitchen and thinking about the things I need to do and instead doing something else, and it's -avoidance. It's this feeling that I'm not ready yet, and that I can always do it later, when I'm ready. That's the best way I can think to describe it. I know consciously about the negative effects, but that's overpowered by not feeling ready.

there is one other thing, which is my mother passed away 6 years ago, it was a slow death from cancer and I temporarily moved back home and helped my Dad care for her during her last 3 months. Basically exactly what you think, I watched her get frail and waste away. It was pretty terrible and I do wonder if I have some mental scarring from that or something. I don't obsess about it, but I do have some mental baggage about it that may be affecting things.

How can I get out of this cycle? ,18Mar2019,1
138,"I'm a guy in my mid-20s, who's coming to slowly realize I might have some disorder related to empathy. Let me explain:

I had a somewhat difficult childhood, which I'd go so far as to say was bordered on emotional abuse from my mother. I moved out as soon as I could when I was 18, and got therapy for depression I was suffering at the time. I'm no longer suffering from that depression.

I lie. A lot. Even when I don't think about doing it, I'll find myself slipping small lies into almost every conversation I have. It's so natural to me, it might as well be second nature. I got into a rather high-paying position early on in my university career by lying, and I advanced through it by doing the minimal work possible by lying. I honestly place a high amount of my self-worth on how successful I am.

I... Really have trouble forming emotional connections. My grandfather died recently. He played a huge part in raising me, and was one of the better influences in my childhood. I didn't feel a thing. When I broke up with my first 3 girlfriends, I didn't feel a thing. Hell, I broke up with them because I just got bored of the relationship, and wanted something new. When I got dumped, I wasn't sad I wouldn't see her anymore - I was upset that the relationship didn't end on my own terms. I've only really ever been with one partner I connected with, and I broke up with her about a year ago.

I know I'm not going to feel any sadness when my parents die, nor any other family who I *should* love (Uncle, aunt, cousins, etc). It's not that I hate them, or even dislike them. I just don't feel any emotional connection to them.

The only thing that really keeps me from breaking any major laws is the chance of getting caught. I've been in positions before where I could steal a cellphone, laptop, or similar device. The only thing that stopped me from doing it is knowing the risk of losing everything else I've worked for wasn't worth the relatively small reward.

So, that's it. How can I properly get this diagnosed? I'd like to find out if I'm just a terrible person naturally, or if I'm actually suffering from APD.",18Mar2019,1
139,"

The short version is, I met her 1.5 years ago, she made sex jokes, I hit on her when I was drunk, which was disrespectful of me obviously. She ghosted me, which makes sense.

Later, I mistakenly flirt with her when she has a boyfriend and we stop talking again. 

I see her in person months later and she apologized for telling me off and I apologized for my immaturity. She says we should hang out and I’ve been thinking about asking if she wants to make it a date. We hugged, and complimented each other.

The only issue is, she hasn’t replied to my messages, just some Snapchat stuff. She admitted she’s lost her phone before, she gets in moods where she doesn’t want to talk to anyone, she could prefer face to face, or whatever. 


I helped her with some depression and she thanked me.

The next morning I even woke up with an afterglow type feeling, like wow I am a new person or something.

As the day went on, one small thing after another brought me down one notch at a time. The moment I think I completely lost it was just one single thought to myself saying ""You're going to fail at this, why even try?""

And I just completely spiraled down from there. I'm so disappointed. Getting a small glimmer of hope and happiness, just to have it smashed to pieces. I'm just so tired.

So basically i stuggle to act like a normal person eg. not freaking out in my head about a phone call i have to make or meeting people etc, 99% of the time i won't do what i need to do because it freaks me out so bad.

I think i have had depression since i was about 14-15 and social anxiety since a very early age.

I was apparently hit and abused as a toddler/young child i don't actually remember it happening because i was so young, so i have a feeling that's where some of my menal issues come from.

But it has just gotten worse. Im at a point now where im so mentally and physically exhausted i can barely finish the schoolday. I couldn't make myself go to school the last days of last week, missing schoolwork and increasing the stress. I thought rest would help me. It kind of did, on sunday i was feeling pretty well, clean, and on my way up again.

147,"This is a very long and 100% true recollection of the past 3-5 years of my life. Some details are hazy and others ive purposefully forgotten or left out for sake of identity. I had multiple 'public episodes' when I was in high school and I'm genuinely afraid, idk why but this all just makes me anxious but it also feels necessary.

 About 4years ago when I was 15 my grandfather died, I didn't really feel anything. My mom came to get me from school and took me home (this is how I was told) I walked out the doors crying but once I sat in the car this overwhelming sense of peace came about me and I've always been curious/extremely afraid of death, I think about it almost everyday. Eventually however this new family problem paired with what I didnt know to be Autism &amp; Attention Defficet Hyperactive Disorder [I know I'm butchering that word] (ASD &amp; ADHD) I was having trouble saying anything at all, the smallest things send me into a blind rage or depression. I lost my girlfriend at the time, but I didnt care, I would have several more and lose them all before the end of of the year and then my friends too. Eventually I transfered to a smaller new school and I finally had what I felt were real friend with shared interest. Eventually a girl who was unlike any other came into my life and I cant even remember how (it was only 3years ago). She dated my other friend at the time who was doing everything I had ever wanted in a group of friends. I was finally accepted, i was being invited places, I was trusted, people wanted to be around me and when I talked it wasnt stupid or weird to them, or maybe it was idk anymore. Anyways, my new bff (the girl) was dating my other friend which they then together exposed me to cannabis (this wasnt the first time, just the first time i actually smoked) The room started spinning and after a while when everything settled my gut was empty and I could eat for once (I also have bad anemia and chronic stomach problems, as a result nowadays I legally use cannabis to actually be able to consume food so this was a miracle moment for me). Months of this went by, us all partying and enjoying eachothers company until one day I found the girl, ill call her by her nickname i gave her at the time for simplicity, Whittles. Whittles was being abused by her boyfriend my other friend so i intervened, long story short she told me she loved me and that she really wanted me so now my bff of the last year became the woman of my dreams overnight. The next day she took my virginity, the day after that she broke up with me for my other friend, and I was cast out of the group. It quickly dissolved after that and after another ""episode"" I had smahed my head into the computer until it was broken then ran out into the woods adjancent to our school in a moment of fight or flight. I was banned from the school district afterwards and pursued my GED while in isolation (I moved from the mainhouse into the barn, my mother is an alcoholic bipolar who would rather fuck than worry about what im doing) After a good long 5-6months living in the barn I had a new roommate and she became my fiance after a year of living together, we moved to her parents for a year, eventually she cheated on me and left me for her classmate who was giving her rides around town, and I had asked her several times if they were doing anything to which the response was 'no' so that stung, im poly and could've cared less if they had at least told me, and they knew that, she just did it to hurt me. Now without getting to much into it, we kicked my mom off the property after I turned 18 and exposed her to my Grandma in Alabama who had given her the property in the first place, she transfered ownership to my aunt and had the entire hosue redone because my mom was also a hoarder and neglectful owner of 12animals. 3cats and 9dogs. So thats why i lived in the barn too if you're wondering. I live with my aunt on the farm in isolation once again and I start college the 4th this April. Im still not well adjusted to other people, im fidgety and nervous, Im scared of cars when I walk down the street and the background chatter from shopping with the bright lights can give me extrenely bad anxiety or a panic attack. Im going to see a counselor but i have a rough past with trying therapy and a lot of my past therapist I either thought were quacks because they wanted me on 'just more magnesium supplements' and others just seemed off putting or upset with constantly and I could never figure out why. The only ones who diagnosed me I left within 2-3months of meeting them and 1/2 doctors thought I was making most of what I told them up for attention or inventing symptoms. But I really was trying to be honest, i still dont know really how to put it into words but I recently discovered BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and I believe that combined with my Autism/ADHD may explain why im such of a mess of a person with a lack of therapy/medication in my life. My entire life was a sheltered one and I never really woke up into until I sat down in that car, ever since then the voice in the back of my head has gotten so loud, it's not its own personlity but I genuinely feel like my own thoughts are the only real thing I can trust about this world and even about me, it feels like everything is out for me, even the people who say they love me i can almost hear them constantly talking about me when I know they arent, othertimes ill hear a plane and the first thought ill have is that this is the end and world war 3 is happening, and unless I see the plane I think a bomb is going to land right on top of me.

149,"Hi guys.

Not sure if anyone will really have any advice? 

I was working w this therapist, who I wasn’t crazy about at the time but I think it was just me being resentful about another therapist who burned me, and really not ready to change. 

Anyway I worked w her, from the recommendation of my dietician, for a couple of months. Things were ok! But I just was going through a lot and I just wasn’t fully in it. I ended up stopping seeing her but never really explaining why. I just was like yeah I’ll be in contact and never was- oops. 


Long story short, the shit has hit the fan for me. Between my moms cancer diagnosis, my living situation, a suicide attempt last year, and just my general issues (eating disorder, anxiety, depression, addiction (maybe bipolar)), there’s just a lot going on. I ended up reaching out to that dietician who I haven’t seen in like idk a year asking if she had therapist recommendations .  She said to go back to the one I ghosted 2 years ago, she reached out on my behalf, and then I emailed the therapist and she agreed to see me. 

So my question is, do I have to go in and explain why I disapearred? Do I act like that never happened? Like Idk what to do because I’ve never gone back after such a long period of time!

Thanks!

TL;DR- do I need to explain to a therapist I ghosted about 2 years ago why I did that, or do I just go in and act like that didn’t happen? ",18Mar2019,2
150,"Hello fellow reader, I want to give you a little help and maybe a little understanding on how I hopefully can help you with your mental problems. I really want you to read this text consciously. Try to really think about it and self reflect.

First of all, I want you to tell the harsh truth. If you are in a depressive, psychotic, borderline, eating disorder kind of state, it is your own fault! I had to accept it and so do you.

Two weeks ago I saw a documentary on Netflix about women from the Kongo who got raped by groups of mercenaries. After such a traumatizing event these women still managed to let the past be and find happiness and joy without beeing mentally destroyed. These women live in a poor country with so little to themselves and they still manage to find strength and joy after such an horrifying event. 

If these awesome women can overcome their past trauma so can you! Most of us do not even have a traumatic experience. Some of you guys took too many bong hits and ended up psychotic by their own. 
So.. let us find out what is happening in us. First of all please try to be open minded and try to reflect on who do you think is actually really you. The I, which you think you are is created by your mind with thoughts and believes from the past. So you identify with your mind. You think you are your mind, but this is false. You are the creator! You are that thing what perceives the thoughts. You are the consciousness. Just ask yourself, who is the  I that perceives this thought? Try to think in this way, you are a beeing with body, mind and soul. You live in a body, with your mind and your soul. So for example, if you are schizophrenic or depressed your mind is in a suffering state. And why is that so? Because your perception of the world is delusional or negative. You create your own reality with your thoughts and feelings. 
So for example, if you think you are being followed by the government and you also create a feeling with it, it will become your reality. This means you have lost the control over your mind. Or another example would be, you are actually happy but thoughts arise which make you feel shitty really quick.
Now is the question, what can we do about it? 

The tools that helped me are awareness of thoughts, meditation and being conscious about my decisions and in general. 

Awareness of thoughts
Everybody of us has a really insane amount of thoughts over the day. How many are we really aware about? Let's take for example your first thought of the day: You stand up in the morning and the first thing you do is think about something negative. Creating thoughts cost yourself energy and if you are not even aware of your negativity in your thought pattern you wont even change it. So: 
1. If the thought is negative, be aware of the thought. Say to yourself that this thought is not your reality and create a positive one
There is also a book from Napoleon Hill the books name is ""Think and Grow Rich"". It is about money and wealth, but let us not talk about that for this moment and just talk about our mentally healthy well being.
2. How you think and feel will eventually be the outcome of how you behave in your environment 
3. Try to realize that you are conditioned by your thought and believe patterns 
Since you are young your mind created patterns and concepts for you to understand and get along in the world to survive. If your patterns are working against you. Change it!
4. Being aware of delusional thoughts
This one is special for me, because I suffered from delusional thinking of my surrounding quite a lot. If you believe for example the ringing of the bell or a car honking is a sign for something please be awere of a) what it should be a sign for b) can this actually be true?. If it can not be true quickly say to yourself that the thought that I had is not true and there was no sign. This is just a delusion. Over time your subconscious mind will remove these patterns and you will life good again. 


Meditation
Meditation helped me quite a lot by lowering my thoughts and just be in the present. Taking the moment for what it is and enjoy it. It also helped me with my awereness, because I really think that the awereness of thoughts and changing the thoughts is the most important thing you can do. 


If you are the creator of your reality in the sense you decide with your consciousnes how to feel and how to think, you can also for example meditate on good feelings mixed with good thoughts. For example visualize daily with a positive feeling combined with a thought your day or this moment. 
Also what me helped immensily is telling myself over and over when I felt shitty and thought negatively that it is just my mind telling me this garbage and it is actually not the reality, because everything is really fine at this moment. 

For me it was something totally different and it will always be for everyone, when you read about something and then you forget it or you really realize and becoming conscious of it. 


So for the end, let me tell you. You are the creator of your life and reality. It is your thinking, feeling and doing (in what your are in control of!) that got you right there were you are now. Don't let outside things influence your being so stressfully and negatively. 
Try to practice positive emotions (gratefulness, compassion, love, joy,)  combined with positive thoughts (""awesome to be alive and get to feel this moment"", ""I am so thankful for having this experience"") in your daily life.  


Your life is not really that long and that is totally fine, now promise yourself you will make your lifetime worth it and say to yourself I will work on myself, stop my suffering and will be joyful again!


I really hope that I could help you, have a wonderful day! :) ",18Mar2019,0
151,"About a year ago I remember having a conversation with my friend. She told me when she was younger she didn’t think she’d live to be 18. At the time I had no idea what she meant. But now I fully understand. I’ve had a revelation that I think I’m probably not meant to live long. I can’t see myself being alive past like, 21. Life is too hard. I fantasize about getting married and having kids but it doesn’t feel like a goal to me, just a dream. I don’t know how I’ll go. I’m not saying I’m going to kill myself, but I don’t know what’s going to happen. Maybe I’ll get a terminal disease or be involved in a freak accident. I just genuinely can’t see myself living a full life. And the scary part is I don’t really feel bothered by this...I’ve accepted it. I’m not really sure where I’m going with this, but I guess I just want to know if I’m alone in this feeling. I don’t know if this my depression talking or I’ve reached some kind of enlightenment.

152,"For the last ~7 years I’ve been through a lot of depressed states including suicidal thoughts, loneliness, etc. Recently, I’ve gotten a hold of my life (read: I’ve gotten used to my depression). I’ve also noticed that I don’t really ever feel “happy” but I gain a strong sense of purpose and relief when I make people I care about happy. For me, this seems like a fine way to live my life because in my mind, the well-being of other people is more important than my own. 

My friends recently learned about this side of my life (I had kept it hidden for the most part so I wouldn’t be a burden with them worrying about me) and they seem to think I need to get professional help so I can be happy myself. I’m worried that switching my mindset will end up making my life worse because then I’ll run into typical problems that would be accentuated by my current struggles that don’t really bother me at the moment (emotional, financial, etc. issues).

154,"Okay, so I have this strange behavior where my mind is in a constant urge to find something to worry about.

For exemple 

Friday night, I came home after work and prepared to have a chill week end. Then suddenly my mind race about a gouvernemental web site I have lost my password for. Made a demand for a new one, didn't get any respond but can't call the hotline because it's the week end. So I end up panicking during all of the week end and numbing the pain by sleep.  (I didn't even needed that site for anything, but of course my mind is like ""but what if...?"")

Made the call Monday morning, everything is fixed, then I had another panic attack after reading on a site the required diploma for a job application ""what if I had lost it?"" Came back home, find my diploma but didn't find another official document. Learned that it's wasn't mandatory to have it past 25 (i'm like 30) but still made research. Then find that document because stressed me didn't take a good look. Was relived for about 20 minutes. Then....well you get it, find another thing to worry about.

It's endless. I'm going to see a shrink but I would  like your opinion into what kind of mental disorder/illness this look like.

I don't think it's OCD because my worrying are not only about material things and not anxiety disorder because I have no physical symptoms.",18Mar2019,1
155,"This is quite hard for me to write. Both, because I feel like an attention-seeker and I don't know how to explain the way I feel. Let's start this off casually; I'm a 15 year old girl, I've got great friends, a boyfriend that cares about me, and a best friend that is like an older brother to me. I'll list everything that's bothering me below:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Regarding my friends and boyfriend; I know that they all care, but I can't shake off the paranoia; at the back of my head, I can't help but think that they might actually hate me, that no one genuinely cares about, and it's driving me crazy.
2. I hate myself. I wish I was dead, as I honestly do not deserve to live. Everyone would be better off without me.
3. I hate my appearance. I find my face grotesque and my body way too fat. Even though I don't eat much, this feeling just won't stop.
4. I have severe social anxiety. If you were to put me with someone who's not my friend, I'd either cry right away or just get a panic attack. Unfortunately, my parents and some teachers don't understand that, which leads to rather embarrassing situations and leaves me feeling like an utter freak.
5. I'm currently in my last year of high school. I live in UK, here, we have this thing called GCSEs. They're exams you take at the end of your last year. Some of them are core subjects and the other one's are your own choices. I chose art, and I regret my choice. I can't stand looking at my work anymore, I find it so bad, it makes me sick to the stomach.

I just needed to get this off of my chest. I'm tired. Earlier in the day, I was considering going through with suicide, but I was too afraid. Pretty pathetic, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all, I think. I really hope I don't come off as an attention-seeker. I hope I didn't trigger anyone with my post, and if I did, I'm deeply sorry. I just want to see if anyone can relate to me, or maybe if someone can even offer advice on how to cope, because I'm honestly not sure how much longer I can go on like this.",18Mar2019,1
156,"Hello reddit, I feel like it would be good to share my experience with you all. I’m currently not feeling very good.

I’m 18 and I’m currently in college. A couple of years ago when I was 16 I met a very beautiful girl, and after a few weeks I had a crush on her. She had a boyfriend, although their relationship wasn’t doing very good. Two months later I moved to another state (to study) but we kept texting each other. The following months I got closer to her to the point in which we were very good friends. Five months after I met her, her boyfriend broke up with her. I was very happy by those news, but I was also sad that I was far from her. I was still in love with her, but she didn’t know it. I kept it that way for over 18 months (until I turned 18). As I was really into her, I wasn’t interested in any other girl. I even had a 5 year plan on all the things that I would do in order to finally be with her.

However, not being with her made me feel very lonely, and that’s how it’s been for the last two years now.

A few months ago I told her everything I felt for her, and she told me that she only saw me as a friend. It was very awkward, and long story short I don’t talk to her anymore.

Weeks later I met a French girl online. I just started talking to her because I needed some help in French and she needed some help in Spanish (which I also speak). As we kept talking, we realised that we had the same sense of humor. She liked my memes and she laughed at my jokes. We started doing calls and we kept doing them frequently. We even got to call every day for hours straight. At some point I told her that I didn’t know how it happened exactly, but I was starting to have a crush on her. She told me that she felt the same for me. I told her that I loved her, and she did the same. I promised her that I would move to France in the future so we could be together.

At some point during one of our calls she told me about her ex boyfriend, and how she lost her virginity. It made me feel even lonelier as I’m still a virgin. A few days ago I told her that I wasn’t feeling very good, and that I was going to take some time to heal mentally, because I didn’t want to do something I would later regret.

After all of this, I thought it would be good to get a girlfriend. I saw a cute girl today at the bus stop and approached to her. I introduced myself and told her that I saw her waiting for the bus and found her cute so I wanted to talk to her. She gave me short answers, not even staring at me, so I stopped talking to her and simply walked away. It was extremely awkward, and I’m worried that if I stay single I’ll feel even lonelier.

I’m currently in my room. It’s almost 11pm in France, and it feels weird not calling my French friend. My self-esteem is not doing very good either. I feel empty, and don’t know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms are irrational anxious/depressive thoughts, a feeling of needing to self harm, feeling like the world isn't real or that I'm not a part of it, suicidal thoughts and seemingly a loss in intelligence and memory. I've noticed I'm also less hygienic, have a lot of aches and pains, especially in the legs, and have become more paranoid lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before this, I was aware of anxiety and depressive issues, including suicidal thoughts that I'd managed to deal with before. I know that if I can bounce back once, I can do it again, and I don't want to stay in this dark place forever.

But the thing is that I like to draw gore and like nurses/doctors with needles etc.. I used to draw so much gore and then put it on my wall (board thingy) and my parents would get concerned. Another problem comes with doctor check ups. For a few years now I have a problem that when I move quickly and suddenly my head gets really dizzy and my period is always at different times and extremely long. Because of that I was thinking that I should go to a doctor to see if I’m missing Fe (I’m taking Fe vitamins now but nothing)  or something but then when I talk to my mom about it she said that there’s a big chance they would take my blood because how else are they supposed to know what’s wrong with me.

163,"My name is Victor. I have had this thing since I was 12-13, sometimes I have periods of time where I lose many of my emotions. Emotions such as fear, disgust, stress, anxiety, empathy, guilt, mostly everything that isn't anger or happiness.  

From the beginning preschool all the way to 5th grade, I was the victim of quite severe bullying. The bullies would piss in my face, force snowballs with rock and salt into my eyes and of course beat me until I bled they did this at recess or after school every singe day. This accompanied with having no friends made my school feel like hell. However, my home life wasn't much better. Whenever my parents would hear me crying myself to sleep and walk into my room telling me to shut up and that I should stop feeling sorry for myself. My father was also almost always away and when I overheard my mother telling him she did not honestly love me, my home felt like hell too. This left me being depressed and suicidal for most of my childhood, I attempted suicide twice at the age of 11. 

About a year after the abuse stopped, the emotionless periods where I only really felt happiness or anger started to occur. These periods of time would last from anywhere between a few hours to weeks. I guess, I just wanted to know if anybody has gone through something similar and whether anybody has been through the same emotionless periods as me.",18Mar2019,1

I’m not a professional but I have recently started wondering if they might have bipolar or borderline type disorders, or similar. A couple months back, they were increasingly unable to handle the day-to-day stress of work, and that crescendoed in an explosive, manic, paranoid episode. Job gone, insurance gone, and access to mental healthcare gone too.

Some time went by and my SO was getting worse, not better. I found the number for our county’s mental health services and told them to call. They did so, but never followed up. Days later: another paranoid, lost-touch-with-reality episode. They left. Initially told me they were staying with family, but the next day they said they couldn’t stand to be around family either. I gave the number again and begged them to call, but SO told me that they thought I and everyone else was conspiring against them, and wouldn’t call anyone whom I recommended.

Furthermore, people wouldn't find me so abrasive if I didn't have this constant underling aggression in me.

Trigger-Warning I guess

Hello,

so, I don't really have anyone to talk to. I feel like I am all alone and the friends I have at the moment will leave me soon enough like every other friend I had in my life. I also suffer from chronic pain and migraines, so my life all in all just sucks.   And I just don't want to feel the pain anymore. Not the physical, and even less the mental pain. I... I just can't take it anymore. 

I just want to talk about my life and I just want... support. I am crying nearly everyday, have breakdowns and panic attackt and I just feel like dying. There is nothing for me that gives me some kind of purpose in life.

My mother was a single mom. I loved her so much as a child, but at the moment... I do love her, but not unconditianlly. A part of me even hates her so much I wish she would finally die... and I don't know if I even feel guilty about these thoughts.

I have two older half-brothers (two differen fathers). When I was one year old my mother ran away from my alcoholic father with my brothers and me. At least that is what she told me. She came to a little town where everybody knew everyone. We where polish living in Germany. My mother came to Germany when she was around 25 years old with her first husband (as well alcholic).

I hated going to pre-school as the first person do every bully me was my teacher. Yes, she shamed me in front of all the ohter children although I only remember one time. I drew with pencil on the table at 5years old. She came to me and said: ""If you can't delete that you will have to pay for the table."" In front of all the other children, loudly. Doesn't sound so bad, but to a sensitive little girl who cried easily?

Of course all the other children started to act like the teacher because if the teacher does it they are allowed to act like that as well, right? Because a teacher is always right. (Fuck you Mrs. Veil) She even shamed me about my name, that it's written falsley which wasn't true at all because it was in my polish passport. Don't remember the things tho. But because of the size of the town every child went to the same school. After pre-school there are three possible schools a child can go to: Hauptschool, Realschool and Gymansium. The ""dumb"" ones go to Haupschool and the ""intelligent"" ones go to Gymnasium. Well, I went to Hauptschool. And the bullying from my first year in pre-school never really stopped. I was nearly drowned by a classmate when we were around 8 or 9 years old, they tried to inflict physical pain, wanted to shame my by putting stuff into my backpack and accusing me of stealing it.

The thing is tho... up to my 14-16 year I don't remember much. Really, I don't. My life... it doesn't feel like a normal life. It's as if I am computer where so many things where deleted.

And then there is my mother. My mother which I adored. I was so depended on her that it must have been unhealthy. I always wanted to be a good girl, to never make her mad. (I guess because I witnessed how she beat my brothers with a belt but I do not quite remember it. Just a tiny bit.)

Turns out she is a toxic mother. She sent me to ballet and to piano lessons. Which is fine but... she constantly critizised me. At every fucking turn. Everything I did felt never good enough for her. My brothers? Never really helped me with the bullying. Yes, my mom went to the teachers to complain etc but it never held long until the bullying started again. What she also did is manipulating me into hating my father but I only remember good things even though he was alcoholic. He taught me swimming, tried to make me happy with the little money he had. And the last time I saw him was when I was 14, too young to realize how I was being manipulated into never wanting to see my father again. But with him I remember feeling safe. Despite the alcohol. I think I was the greatest love he ever had. And now he might be dead. And I feel so guilty.

When I was 13 I tried to kill myself. No one knows about it. I wanted to drown myself in my bathtub. At that time I didn't know I had depression. Heck, up to three-four years ago I didn't know I had depression. Never even knew that was a thing. I was around 22 at that time. I slept with a knife under my pillow just in case I wanted to kill myself. The only thing I remember from that time is crying. But I went to the medical centre at the university and they helped me realize what I had.

When I was 14 my mother remarried. He provides for her and me and my brother, (the oldest brother has a job and lives with his grilfriend at the moment) but only because of my mother. He doesn' respect my brother nor me, is a choleric and my first memory of him is that I didn't want to learn for school. Somehow it escalated and I had a breakdown. (I was 10 at the time I think) I was so scared of him I hid under the table, crying, screaming. My mother held him back, but instead of coming to me and hugging me she went away and I was left alone. Please, for the love of God, never leave a crying child alone!

But with my mum it also got worse. When I was 22 I went to study for half a year in Great Britain. Sometimes I think it was the worst decision of my life... other times I think it was the greates. In GB the depression started and I realizied I would really kill myself if I stayed there longer. So I went on an Erasmus program for the second semester in Belgium. When I got back home after that one year... my mother was highly religious. Yes, she was religious before, me too, as we are from poland lol but... my God. She... She went crazy.

We had a huge argument after I came back. Around two weeks after my arrivel I guess. It was so bad we screamed and I cryed and I hid in the bathroom. Somehow she opened it up and stupidly I though she would try to talk to me and we could hug it out, but what does she do? Sprinkles me with holy water because she thinks a demon took possession of me, or something like this. From then on her obsession with religion got only worse. She started to believe every world in the bible to be literally true. Evolution is just a scam for her. No, she is not a flatearther, nor is she a anti-vaccer. Still.... the believe is destroying her.

I am a chaotic artistic person as well. I want to make my own money through art. My mom is very tidy and wants every room to look like a fucking IKEA catalogue. Which will never be possible while I still live with her.

Now my depression got worse again through the last couple of months. I can't sleep good as well and suffer from Insomnia. An houer ago my mom came into my room at around 4 am in the morning and critzised me for not being able to sleep, that it's my own fault and that my chaotic room is responsible for my insomnia. Oh, and my Assassins Creed poster is as well responsible for my sleep behaviour because ""It looks demonic."".

The worst of all which brought me over the edge and gave me a panic attack: ""Are you even human?!""

Yes, mum, I am a human. Just because I am not your ideal daughter doesn't mean that I am not human with feelings and needs.

Sometimes I really wish she would finally die.

At the end of the day... I just want someone to truly love me and be there for me. Like I would be there for that person. But... sometimes I don't have the feeling that I am capable of loving someone as I have never been able to fall in love, be in a relationship or hold any relationship I ever had in my life.

Sometimes i feel like everything about me and how i feel the world just tends to shift way too fucking much, It feels like every single screw in my head is slightly loose. My temperament and moods are the closest thing to stable i can find and their not really stable as in static their just stable as in more pattern based and more long lasting, but meanwhile how i feel emotionally seems to be even more unpredictable and crippling than the fact that i feel like my temperament seems to be phasic in nature. But you can track a phase of temperament, on a moment to moment level i feel like i can never stay in a straight line and my emotions and train of thought are swerving and jumping all over the place or just slowly fading out and in depending on my mood, even when my temperament seems to shortly stabilize i can't stay in a straight line and most of the time i have a general sense of apathy towards the external world, at this rate i'm going to be living with family or on the streets for the rest of my life.

180,"As time goes on, I've come to realise I get really burnt out/exhausted/disinterested in people who take an interest in me. People are who are eager to see me and enthusiastic to share their lives with me, or have unfettered love for me. It weirds me out and makes me uncomfortable and exhausted and I tend to withdraw. I know rationally speaking, that this is exactly the kind of affection I should want in my life, but it always feels like they expect too much of me. 

For example - I'm in a good relationship now, and have good friends who invite me out on a regular basis. However, I'm getting resentful of what I think they expect -- for example, support I can't offer, or to be the life of the party when I'm tired.

Is there a science-based reason for why I feel this way? I know my parents were quite withholding and neglectful when I was younger, and I'm wondering if that has anything to do with it.

187,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

My brother, who is 16, has been showing signs of depression for a while now since the middle of last year and I’m really worried about him going forward in the run up to his exams in under 2 months. He’s been like this for around a year now, he was expelled from his last school for possession and smoking weed in December after hanging out with the wrong crowd. He is now at a good new school (by some stroke of luck they took him in with good faith) and is now living with my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

At this time last year his mood began to change, less talkative, and just generally not really the same person the me or my family used to know. His mood swings became a bit more erratic (not bipolar however) and started to be noticed by most people around him. When asked about it by myself or others he said ‘I’m fine, leave me alone’. So we kind of passed this on as usual teen behaviour (I was the same).This continued for most of the year until last summer when he went on holiday with my parents and seemed to have a pretty good time (I was away working).

&amp;#x200B;

However fast forward to September when it’s time to go back to school, he told my mum before she dropped him off in a very sincere tone, ‘Mum, I really don’t want to go back to school.’ My mum passed this off at the time not really thinking about it. His grades were dropping, teachers were seeing him change and he started to close himself off and get in and around the wrong crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months later my parents get the dreaded call ‘Please come and pick up your son, he won’t be coming back.’ Caught red handed rolling joints in the bathroom with his ‘mates’. All the while with all of this going on he also had a girlfriend in the mix. I phoned him as soon as I found out and he was balling his eyes out, and had no idea what was going on. I told him that it was time to turn his life around and start from a fresh slate, forget everything and everyone at that place and move on, regardless of what he did or didn’t do. It seemed that he had cried for help, but no one really noticed. My mum and dad are still in denial about what they could’ve done to prevent and help him but I also told them that it’s gone now and it’s time to start again.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now where he has joined a new school that took him in regardless of what he did. He started well, made friends quickly and has joined the local rugby club to continue his hobby which he does very well in. However now as the exam period is slowly approaching, he’s in denial that he has to sit these exams (GCSE’s) whether he likes it or not. It’s now got to the point where whenever he is reminded of that fact, he closes off, doesn’t talk to anyone and stays on his phone. My parents have cried out to me to try and help him and talk him through which I have tried to do with a small amount of success but I slowly see him not even talking to me anymore and progressively closing himself off to the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m worried. I want the best for him absolutely, and I’m worried that he’ll fall into this spiral of decline that will be almost impossible to get out of. I’m worried that he’s going to turn to drugs and hang out with the wrong people again, and with the recent rise in teen stabbing across the uk I would destroy me if I see he’s around or involved in it, or worse, a victim. His silent cries for help haven’t gone unnoticed, I’ve been watching over him from afar and checking in but the situation is getting worse and almost out of hand. I’ve mentioned depression to my parents and they haven’t quite clocked onto the idea completely yet but I’m sure he’s showing strong signs of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys I really need help/advice, anything I can do to help him at least until his exams are over and done with and then I can deal with it much closer.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.",18Mar2019,0
188,"I notice that whenever I’m in the process of doing something that changes my routine my depression gets worse. Like visiting family during spring break: leading up to my visit and during the first 1 or 2 days of my visit my depression started getting noticeably worse. I got better through spring break once I got into a routine (Even though I wasn’t really doing anything productive) but once it was time to go back (again, 1 or 2 days prior to my flight back to school) I start feeling blue and extra depressive again. Today was my first day back to school and as the day winds down I feel like absolute shit.

189,"Whenever I walk my dog through the trail in my park and I see other people, I get extremely angry. I'm talking really angry.

Is it possible to just be done with life? ",18Mar2019,3
191,"I wonder sometimes if my mind is sound. I'll have conversations with people and sometimes you're just not on the same wavelength and communication just goes horrible and I wonder to what extent is this normal?

There's so many parts of me that are dishonest. Not in a horrible way, but sometimes I feel like if I wasn't a nice guy I could be a sociopath. Except maybe I'm not that smart. Or charming. Or risky. But the ways I try to  analyze people and got good at it and tell what they like and use that to my advantage sometimes feels so horrible. Mainly because it kinda just happens, but at the same time I realize it and let it happen anyway. Because I can't be bothered to do something about it.

I have too much of a *Je m'en fou-*attitude and I've started hating it. I want to have something to really care about and to be able to start and actually finish stuff. To have some discipline. To know what work is and to be able to just start because I just should.

Instead I just muck around and let life happen. It's like most of my actions I do something and then I see what happens. I rarely just do do do. I do, I watch, I think this, should I think that? Shouldn't I use X, shouldn't I use Y? Maybe I'm doing allright! Just a little more doing now. Ready? Set. Go! Do number two. Looks allright, let's go this style all the way aaaand I fucked it up. And I watch and I watch and I wait for someone to come on down and see where I mucked up and tell me, ""hey! Whatcha doin? Do this or that."" And I'm on my way again.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a miracle I got this far I think sometimes. I truly am an idiot. That's another problem. My whole puberty was focused on being rather intelligent. The worst thing anyone has ever said to me was: ""you're a smart kid, but you should study to really unlock your full potential."" All I ever heard was the bit before the but. I don't think I did much studying before the last 2 years of high-school and even then. Senior year was horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

I started coming out of my shell a little bit more and paid less and less attention in class. Since I didn't really study that well, my grades started to drop very fast and just barely made it to graduation. Do you think I would've done better in life if I had failed there? ""One day you'll run into trouble!"" They always said, but I've gotten away with everything. I still haven't died, so what else does life have for me?

Bla Bla Bla. Do you think it would be good for me to see someone to get all of that stuff out? I feel like I can't spray this on friends/my girlfriend. I feel like I should be able to tell my girlfriend this, especially since she'll probably take it pretty well. But at the same time I'm a bit afraid of ""exposing"" myself. I'm not sure if I'd rather speak like that to my girlfriend or stand naked before 500 people. If none of the people know me I might choose the latter.

194,"I was prescribed abilify and prazosin a few months ago for what the doctor thought was trauma related mood disorder (which I have been dealing with since adolescence...?). I'm not really sure what that means, since these problems began before my traumatic experiences, I don't trust this doctor. The combination made me so sick I thought I was going to die so I stopped taking them and have been afraid to go back to the doc because I figure she will just put me on something else that'll make me feel sick and completely apathetic towards life- this triggered a depressive state lasting weeks. Has anyone else had this sort of adverse affect with this combo? Hydroxixyzne makes me super depressed, I tried birth control which made me actually feel suicidal. These are the only meds I've tried so far.What do I try next? Im at a complete loss.

195,"I feel like my commitment phobia is more than just the standard 'I can't be in a relationship'. It's so bizarre because I'm someone who wants to be in a relationship, the kids with the white picket fence, etc. but any time the opportunity presents itself, I panic. I mean, full-on sheer *panic*. I feel the same sensation I do as when I'm on an airplane and I realize I can't get out. When I started seeing a therapist in middle school, I remember her saying a word and I had to correspond a word to it and when she said 'love' I said 'jail'. So, y'know, I was clearly a kid full of happiness and rainbows. 

Moving on...

For most of my life this has been how it's happened, meaning only with relationships.

However, over the last few years, it's seemed to escalate at an extreme level. 

For a couple examples:  
1.) I want to get another pet; each time I've went to get it, I panic and get sad about ""all the freedom"" I'm going to lose (~~I have no life so I'm not sure what perceived freedom I think I have~~), and end up leaving empty handed. Which is stupid, because the dog I have now is the the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I know I would end up loving any dog I adopted.  
2.) I want to move; I find a place to live, but I think about how difficult it would be to move, how I wouldn't see my family anymore, etc. and I freak out about it. The last time I moved (two years ago), I legitimately broke down in tears when everyone left after moving my stuff and actually had to call a therapist hotline because I was practically inconsolable at the level 'what did I just do???' by signing a 12 month lease.  


3.) I bought a car a few months ago. I was so excited to get it, drove around in it and loved it, it was my ideal car. A little out of my price range, but not much, and I went for it. I went with my uncle, and within 30 minutes of my signing the paper, sitting in their lounge area, I started panicking. I began tearing up, and told my uncle I felt like I'd sold my soul and I'd never be able to get out of this loan. I was stuck with it. He calmed me down. Within two days I was back in love with my car and fine.  


I absolutely hate this about myself. I feel like if I don't have someone with me, babysitting my choices or forcing me to do something, I can't make the decision. It's very opposite of my personality, as I'm typically a head-strong, outgoing person. I miss how I was in my early 20's when I wanted something, and I just went for it. Do other people that have commitment phobia have these issues? Is this issue something more advanced/completely different entirely? I'm at the point where I'm desperate for my life to have motion, but I can't make myself do anything out of fear. ",18Mar2019,1
