0,"Let me start by saying I'm 99% sure I don't have a dissociative disorder‚Äîthe remaining 1% is just my belief that you can never be 100% positive about anything, so I'm as certain as I can be.

However, I've always felt that I'm made up of different aspects of me. Again, they're not dissociated personalities‚ÄîI don't think I've ever skipped whole events or conversations like people with DID or anything like that.

I envision these aspects with ample detail and characterization‚Äîthey each have names, ""physical"" appearances, mannerisms, etc. I've even illustrated them and corresponded with them in writing in my journals. Currently, I feel there's six of us:

1. My loving side.
2. My ""bad"" side.
3. My rational-logical side.
4. My gender-dysphoric side‚ÄîI'm trans.
5. My emotionally healthy/empathetic/easy-going/magical thinking prone side.
6. Me‚Äîjust plain me.

I say there's *currently* six, because we haven't always been. Sides 1 and 2 have always been there, but the others have arrived after life-defining events. For example, I became aware of side 5 only last week, after closing my gender counselling process with my therapist, which was absolutely ***huge*** for me.

I can usually ""hear"" them talk in my head, in a similar way you ""hear"" yourself read in your head. They talk to me and to one another. When no one's around, we all just talk out loud. We gesticulate and respond to one another as if we were all in the room‚Äîno, I don't hallucinate, I don't literally see or hear anything, but there's some sort of bottled up pressure that gets released if we do the exercise of pretending we're all actually present in the room.

We become specially vocal the more emotionally excited we are or the more something touches us emotionally. Also when we have to make a hard decision‚Äîeach of us has a different angle.

At certain points in life, I've felt that one or another has been more ""in control"". For example, when I was a self-destructive and depressed teenager, the ""bad"" side was in charge. After certain important realizations regarding my gender transition, I'm in charge‚Äîbut sides 1 and 5 have gained huge influence since, so they're both like ""my first officers"", so to speak.

I know that all of us think of ourselves as having sides, but I have only met one other person in my whole life who does things such as name these sides and envision them so vividly‚Äîagain, without actually hallucinating.

So, my question to this subreddit is, does anyone out there have an experience like this? If so, I would very much appreciate it if you would share.

I no longer feel this is a bad thing. I just think it's part of me, of us. We girls just want to know we're not the only ones.

if something goes wrong whether it's controllable or not, i let it ruin my day.

if something goes wrong with another person, i blame them and never let them forget and if i forgive i feel as though they got away with ruining everything (if they did or not) i let this ruin the day and the following days after cause i can't let it go.

i understand we have regrets and can't control everything that happens and it's how we react to these situations that matter but how do i stop my brain from continuing this pattern and ruining my relationships with people ?

2,"15M here. I hate my life for no particular reason. I hate the world and everything it stands for. I'd almost like to kill myself just out of protest because I just hate the concept of life so much. Like ""Oh, you're forcing me to eat to survive? Guess I'll kill myself. How would you like that, world, huh?"" I know it sounds silly but I think like that all the time. If someone suggests getting help I think ""So you're saying that I eigher put in work and go to therapy or live miserably my whole life? Ever heard of suicide?"".

6,"I finally decided to try (and stick with) traditional antidepressants to see if it they would help with my long-term depression and anxiety. I have been taking my first (Lexapro) for two months. I also have ADHD. Telling these 3 disorders apart can be a challenge but it‚Äôs important that I do a better job so I can communicate this info to my doctor so we can make the best medication choices together. I have a wonderful psychiatrist, but I am finding that I am not great at self-analysis; therefor, not giving him the best or most accurate information, description of symptoms, how I am feeling, or whether medications are working in a way that I want and expect.  

I am a very open, verbal person so it‚Äôs not apprehension speaking with my doctor but more a lack of fundamental understanding of my own feelings or changes in feelings over time.  In my last appointment, he asked if my meds were working and whether I was feeling better and I honestly can't objectively tell.  He cautioned me on using outside influences to gauge my well-being and instead work on getting in touch with my feelings.  Oh boy :)    

I decided to start keeping a daily journal to write down feelings, symptoms, and things that pop in my head that I think could be helpful to share but I am hoping you all could share some of the questions you ask yourself to check in and monitor how you feel especially when it comes to meds.

He used to be on anti-depressants but stopped due to side effects. 80% of the time he is in a good state, but he‚Äôll have a couple episodes a month I would say in which he‚Äôs off, sulky, and is open with me about his depression.

9,"It seems like such a simple question for many people. I frequently contradict myself. I'll get very excited about taking myself in a new direction then quickly lose focus and momentum. To be honest I really just like playing video games, listening to (sometimes making) music, and watching TV/Movies that I get really into. Throw in some social interaction, sex, and exercise here and there and I would probably be good for life. It makes me feel lazy that I care so little about figuring out all the things other people are out there doing (relationships, career moves, social activities). Maybe I just don't have the energy for all that?? If I could be anything, I would be a creator (music, writing, movies). But I've only seen that as a fantasy. So I'm either living my life for other people's sake at the expense of my soul or I just don't have the mental or physical capacity to be as driven and social as most people. I don't even care enough about my mental health to commit to therapy for more than a few months.

13,"Well, last year I had to attend 10 funerals, one of which was my best friend who committed suicide. Had my first love leave me because I was too needy. Then she goes on to call me a bunch of stuff that still hurts to this day. I probably texted her a million times begging her to talk to me. Not she thinks I'm crazy.

This will sound strange, but my obsession with how I look stemmed from comparing myself with kpop idols that are inhumanely attractive. I know they have layers of makeup and professional stylists with them, but I spend a decent amount of time thinking about what I would look like if I had their stylists. So, to comfort myself, I look up pictures of them without makeup on and compare my features to theirs (eye size, forehead, nose bridge, chin length, etc.) 

I take a lot of photos of myself that I delete immediately after‚Äîprobably about 60-80 a day. I look in the mirror at least a dozen times, but sometimes, I refuse to look in the mirror because I don‚Äôt want to see myself.

I had a telephone assessment recently but felt pressured so didn't really express how severe one of the issues I face is. The problem is that I feel what I failed to mention could be a key indicator of a separate mental health condition.

So now I want to call up and explain it, but I don't want to come across as self diagnosing by asking if this issue could mean I have this condition but don't feel I can adequately express how I feel without mentioning it.

Do you think the people on the phone would think negatively of me if I called them up and asked them to test me for this condition by name? Or do you think I should try not to mention any specific conditions?

19,"This is a bit of a rant/vent, bare with me. 

Dear Reddit,

I am writing in hopes of some kind of consolation or some kind of peace of mind maybe? I apologize for length. I will keep it as short as possible. 

My boyfriend and I just broke up two weeks ago. I will elaborate on what happened from my side and things he told me. 

I am 21 and he is 20. Young I know. And your assumptions of immaturity are correct. 

So what happened, we had started talking and hanging out the end of April last year. We went on a trip to British Columbia in June, he told me he loved me. I didn‚Äôt then, I was honest. I knew it hurt him and I felt bad but I knew there was something there I just needed more time. I wanted to love him back. I did. But I just couldn‚Äôt lie about that. I just came out of a hard long term relationship and was reluctant to give myself like that. 

Anyways, I freaked out after we got back meaning I distanced myself a bit and I slept with someone else. I told him right away. At this point we were not dating. I felt bad though so I told him. It hurt him. But he told me he forgave me. So we continued. I was pretty sure about him from that point on and made myself available to him and only him. He was great, things were great. I honestly could not complain. 
Now I have my imperfections, I would get annoyed or irritated at small things. Like the way he‚Äôd say what. He wouldn‚Äôt pronounciate the T and I would be like no say the T. It was so small and insignificant. But he took those things rather personally. And then expressed to me I wanted to change him. I don‚Äôt think those things translate to that. Honestly. I know now, I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything and it doesn‚Äôt even matter. But it does matter because it eventually snowballed into him thinking I wanted to change who he is as an entire person. 

Let me go back and explain that I expressed to him what I want in my life and in my partner. He was all gun hoe on being everything and wanting everything I wanted. I literally told him many times, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt ultimately want what I want, then there is no point in continuing this.‚Äù
He told me he did. Every. Time. So, I believed him. 

And as I said things carried on, he was great, treated me great and I was grateful for him. I told him I appreciated him and was grateful for him, all the time. I made a huge point of that because I know how important it is to make the person you‚Äôre with feel like you actually appreciate them. 

Here‚Äôs where things changed, we got a dog in the middle on November, and the day we got the dog, his mom kicked him out and it was a pretty brutal fight they got into. So on we went to find a place. I had a place locked down in less than a week, we struggled a bit to get together the damage deposit, but made it work. I was proud of us. Proud that we could overcome that. However, in that same week, I found I was pregnant, and then 4 days later, we moved into the new place. 

Whoa.

It gave me whiplash. I‚Äôm sure it did the same to him. 

Within three weeks, all of this. But we both had decided we were going to stop smoking weed too. Because there was a baby on the way now and it was time to step up. But the kicker is he didn‚Äôt talk to me or tell me how he really felt about any of it!! He distanced himself and did not talk to me about it whatsoever. Even when I would sit him down and ask, ‚Äú is there anything I am doing wrong? Is there anything you need to talk about to me? How do you feel about all of this?‚Äù His answers would be vague, and always along the lines of, ‚Äúeverything is fine and I‚Äôm more than happy with you‚Äù so I would drop it. Once he brought up an issue and I took it well. 

Wellll, he started smoking again, at that point I was worried. In late December. Or earlier. Obviously he was stressed but he would not and refused to communicate with me. I found out as well that he had been hiding smoking weed from me and it was heart wrenching to say at the least. I felt immensely betrayed. He also lied to me about wanting the same things just because he wanted me to like him. His words. He would look directly into my eyes and lie straight through his teeth to me. 
We got into a couple of escalated fights. But with the stress, which in hindsight could have been handled much more maturely. For whatever reason in those moments it just wasn‚Äôt handled right by either of us. 
We talked about our options with the baby. We wavered on abortion and keeping it. And decided to keep it. He seemed really excited and loving. I wanted to believe this was my happily ever after. He told me prior to all of this even happening he wanted to marry me. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and change my last name. So I thought it was all perfect. Until he started feeling a bit more distant and I felt that. Because he started lying to me. And manipulating me, but I realize now he was manipulating me to begin with.

In little arguments that‚Äôs when he would bring up things that I did that bothered him. And that is a manipulators tactic so that they can exert the blame and almost always it would turn into me apologizing for something I didn‚Äôt even know I was doing. 

But then he left me in January. Told me he didn‚Äôt want this. But honestly I just think it‚Äôs because I started to catch his lies more and more. He was outted and wanted a way out. And he insisted and persisted he was absolutely not lying to me. Because he didn‚Äôt want to lie to me. He hide and lied about smoking to me. I could smell it but he tried to hide it with cologne. Like how stupid do you think I am?? So after I found that out that‚Äôs when all the bullshit came out. And he still lied to me about what he was doing and where he was. He‚Äôd sneak over to his friends while I was out doing my thing to get high. 

It happened pretty fast after all this came out about him. On January 5th I slept over at my dads and we talked on the phone the next day, I asked him straight out, ‚Äúdo you want this or no?‚Äù He said he didn‚Äôt. And I said I didn‚Äôt either. 
Yaaaay! Stories over! Right? Wrong. 

I was heartBROKEN. Still am. But better. I felt like in complete loss. My only thoughts were, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt lose him because I have his baby and I don‚Äôt want to lose all the great things we were/are‚Äù. Because in reality we did not have a bad relationship at all. We worked well together but there wasn‚Äôt nearly enough communication. 
So on a whim I went to our place. I had been staying at my dads for a couple nights and I didn‚Äôt know he‚Äôd be there but ran into him. We started talking and he asked me, ‚Äúif I asked you to come back tonight, would you?‚Äù And my response was, ‚ÄúI need to think about that‚Äù. I was so hurt. And so I did think about it. I came back the next evening and we agreed we were doing this. But then I felt so weird. I was no longer living there, he had our dog and still does. He had been lying to me for quite sometime and I felt burnt. I just wanted to make it better though. Fix it. But he lied to me again about reactivating an old Instagram account. I was so anxious and sick to my stomach that I, and I know this is wrong, but disclaimer: up until the this point I never had this urge, but I did it. I went through his phone. Found more confirmations of his lies. Confronted him and he turned it on me totally. Like I know it‚Äôs an invasion of privacy. Completely. I apologized. But he also had many many many many times before offered for me to go through his phone and I never obliged because I trusted him. I felt like I needed to and I got the confirmation. He still wasn‚Äôt being honest. 
The terms of us trying this was for him to be totally honest and he just couldn‚Äôt be. And I had to be less insecure. But him lying is just a breeding ground for more insecurity, in my opinion. 

Anyways the next day he told me he needed to think about it. I left to give him space. And I couldn‚Äôt. I lasted a few hours and went back and I said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait. I need to know now. And you should know if you want this.‚Äù And he told me he didn‚Äôt. It was brutal. I was putty honestly. I was pregnant and here I have this guy telling me that he doesn‚Äôt want me. 

I got an abortion last this past Thursday. He didn‚Äôt even ask me how I am doing. He knew I was doing it and he knew when it was. But he doesn‚Äôt care. He wants to be a child. He wants to just play video games, smoke weed, and do stupid shit with his friends. And I can‚Äôt tell you how manipulated I feel. I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how broken and lost I feel. How can someone be so merciless? So lacking of empathy and so selfish? 
The hardest part in all of this is accepting the person he truly is vs. The version of him that he created for me. I‚Äôm just shocked honestly....  I never saw this coming. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to go through in my life and I have been through some hard shit. But this, this takes the cake. I have a hard time keeping it together sometimes but I‚Äôm doing the best I can. I know there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. 

When I think back, there were signs in the beginning. He has a dui, the relationship he was in before, he was with a woman who was engaged to someone else, he has no respect for his own mother, and he literally has moved to another province and came back twice to avoid problems. 

So if anything, I feel guilty for falling prey to his manipulative and charming ways. I feel silly for even going down that road with him to begin with. But here I am, I did and I love him. I eventually won‚Äôt. But the pain I feel is incomparable to anything I‚Äôve felt before. 
He is the hardest love in my life. I‚Äôm just trying to push through these emotions. I miss him a ton and it hurts. I‚Äôm trying. ",21Jan2019,1
20,"Hello.

I‚Äôve been struggling with some mental health problems for some time now, I seeked help because of possible depression last year before the summer.  The NHS messed up and claimed they saw me, when they never have, this confused me, my GP was on the phone to the NHS (Mental health department) for ages, it was intense. 

I‚Äôm almost certain I have social anxiety or similar, my brain tells me everyone is staring and judging, I shake and breakdown sometimes due to social interactions. 

Furthermore, I‚Äôve tried to kill myself, twice. Both were self inflicted wounds, not overly bad but bad enough to raise attention when family members saw it. 

To be honest, I would rather be diagnosed with these problems and get therapy or medication than leave it. However I am honestly scared to seek help again, it‚Äôs like the GP doesn‚Äôt understand my problems. Even though he probably does. 

I know many of you are going to immediately say YES! But I have extremely important exams soon, I am super limited on time right now, and I really need to focus on getting these grades. 

In addition, I probably have some sort of OCD? The symptoms are hard to explain, but sometimes I keep redoing things for no reason, everything must be perfect and i love control of things.

I‚Äôve had the recent experience of an ex telling me that I was toxic and manipulative because I confronted him about things that he did that caused me pain in and out of our relationship. One of which being his relationship with a certain girl (which I ended up being right about) 
His response was to refuse to acknowledge my pain, refuse to apologise and tell me that I was manipulative and toxic because now his own friends said that he needs to take a long hard look at how he treats people. 

This has got me thinking. If someone is blatantly refusing to own up to their shit and apologise - how do you deal with it? 
How do you get closure and how do you move on? 
How do you deal with someone accusing you of toxic behaviour and other negative personality traits, when you know that this isn‚Äôt you?

25,"For a couple years now I've been feeling awful mentally. I started realizing it about 2 years ago and it's just been getting worse and worse. I think I might have some form of social anxiety, but I've never gone to a therapist to get anything diagnosed as I've never really had the opportunity so who knows. It's less that I'll have full panic attacks if I feel uncomfortable in social situations, and more that I'll just not be able to partake in certain conventions entirely because my brain will just tell me that I can't. For example, if I'm in class and people around me are having casual discussions, I absolutely can not bring myself to join in since my brain will tell me that I would just be intruding on the conversation an nobody would want to talk to me anyway. More recently however, I've been having these weird obsessive thoughts, where I will latch on to some game or tv show or movie or even some daydream I'll make up in my head, and it will literally be the only thing I think about for weeks, to the point where I won't want to talk about anything else. It's to the point where it's often hard to study and I can barely even enjoy things that aren't related to the topic. Could this be OCD or is it normal?

29,"So, I did talk to my mom and my therapist about this and my dad has been made aware by my mom about this whole thing that has been happening in my head with my dad making me feel super uncomfortable (in a female type of way). The reactions from my mom and therapist were both very different and I kind of wish my therapist didn't push me so hard for more info that was too unbearable to even think about. I already told him the basics but i couldnt control myself enough to really trust myself to not start crying. My voice was not wanting to work and I felt my brain starting to drift off i guess because of how uncomfortable i felt talking about this to anybody in person. mom handled it way better(to my surprise). I think she handled it better because she said that she dealt with this with her dad and even my dad's dad but not as badly as I am. I still cried some when I told her but at least my brain didn't shut down due to stress overload from the pressure.  It has however gotten way worse and is only continuing to get worse. I don't know if it's because I talked about it so it's more prevalent in my brain or the fact that people I know, know what's going on which makes me uncomfortable.

I know I need to go out of my room in order to eat and stuff but being anywhere near my dad makes me almost cry and I don't want to make a scene in front of my parents. I know this topic is allitle taboo to most people but I have heard that other people have had to deal with this and that I'm not the only one. Could anybody give me some helpful advice that worked for them when they were dealing with such unbearable feelings? Is there anybody out there who knows what I'm dealing with?",21Jan2019,1
30,"i dont know what im gonna do. i feel like im living in a show where the universe gets to ruin me over and over.

i feel like crap every single day. i have depression, social anxiety, body image insecurities and suicidal thoughts, with one attempt.

my mom won‚Äôt make me a therapy appt even though she insisted on me having a psychiatrist and a therapist. that was last year. i never have a professional outlet and have never gotten close enough with a therapist to get diagnosed. god, i sound like a hormonal teen. but please, hear me out.

from the start, my mom and dad left each other when i was 6 months old. my mom and older sister raised me on the idea that i was worthless, fat, ugly, gross, etc. they would, and still, constantly bully me and continue to make me feel that way. i haven‚Äôt felt happy living with her, and i don‚Äôt know if i ever will. she is the person that has made me cry the most in my lifetime.

i have a really weird personality. im really loving and accepting, but i can turn snarky and disrespectful in the snap of a finger. i have really bad trust issues, since most people i‚Äôve cared about have turned on me completely and hurt me in horrible ways. there aren‚Äôt many people i trust with my dark stuff, but there are moments i‚Äôll tell or show someone something and instantly regret it. 

the school i currently go to is really bad. everyone thinks everything is joke, and think being bad people is okay. they all do it for popularity. thats what its all about. and i find myself stuck when i look at myself and just see the disgusting mess everyone else must see. i‚Äôve been told horrible things about myself there, and i‚Äôm supposed to laugh because, again, it always a joke. especially about my image, that im ugly or that i act like im pretty when im just gross. i‚Äôve been called an ice cream scoop and a whale and just plain ole fat.

there is one guy that has made me feel amazing about myself for at least seconds. he‚Äôs my favorite person ever, and i started to really hold on to him. then i developed feelings for him and he didn‚Äôt return them. that really sent me down a dark hole because he continued to be flirty and protective over me, and he still is. which makes me angry because he‚Äôs leading me on.

and there is so much more wrong with me but its just so much. im impulsive and make stupid mistakes and im paranoid and insecure and indecisive and i just feel abandoned all the time. i though i must have some kind of problem. i did research and i think i have BPD, but since my mom wont take me to therapy, i cant talk about it. and i saw on a reddit post comment that BPD doesn‚Äôt form in teens because their personality isn‚Äôt formed (someone confirm that for me?).

i don‚Äôt expect an official diagnosis, because that can‚Äôt be done. and im just really scared that i‚Äôll break. because i want to die, i really do. but i also want to live. yet i think i might want to die even more.

please. someone help me.",21Jan2019,1
31,"Does anybody have any experiences of having to work really hard to get over somebody?

For coming on four years now I (m, 20) have struggled to move on from unrequited feelings I held for a straight male friend of mine. These feelings coincided with the onset of my depression and CBT would suggest that these feelings served as an important factor in the worsening of my mental health.

After basically four years of being apart from him since we‚Äôve left school and having blocked him on social media to get some space, my feelings, although diminished, still exist.

Despite being in a relationship with a girl I care about enormously, and having gained a new circle of friends and experiences at university, I still love him. I still find myself crying sometimes about how much I miss him, or about how if only I was with him and could be happy.

It‚Äôs almost like my brain has inextricably linked my happiness to him and I worry that without someone getting past him I will never get to a better place mentally.

Does anybody else have any experiences like this, or any advice for dealing with this sort of thing as a depressed person?

Thanks

TL;DR - still in love with a straight friend after four years of being apart and not seeing him on social media. How can I get past this?",21Jan2019,1

34,"So I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety and depression for around 4 years now.

I‚Äôm actually supposed to be seeing a psychatrist next week to get meds and the whole thing is very overwhelming but also kind of nice to finally be getting some help.

Anyways, I‚Äôve found that sometimes in order to not feel overwhelmed by it, I bring it up causally to my friends and sometimes I feel like they‚Äôre uncomfortable with it? Like I act very comfortable and easygoing with it which I guess isn‚Äôt very common. I also mention that a lot of things trigger my anxiety and that I can be irrational with my thoughts and sometimes just mentioning it makes it sound like an excuse, even though realistically it shouldn‚Äôt.

My own sister calls me intellectually slow, and sometimes a sudden fit of rage overcomes me even during small disputes. I've been able to suppress the rage sometimes but I'm afraid I'll say something I'll regret if it comes to that point. 

I was put  on antidepressant at one point during this,which helped, but I found myself to be numb again so I stopped taking them. Now, I'm starting to get angry again.

Lately, I've been holding back by just ignoring fam members when they tick me off but I can't do this forever. I can't tell anyone bc my parents are not open-minded to mental illness and I'm currently fuming at my sis.

After she relapsed tonight she asked me to reach out to Reddit on behalf of her to possibly get some insight of her options she might have to help out her on the path of recovery. Everything shared here will be promptly read to her, so ANYTHING is appreciated.

A little backstory.

She started cutting 10 years ago as a way to cope with depression and through a series of hard and awful events she has used it fairly consistently as a coping mechanism. When she was 19 and we were engaged, she made a resolve to quit cold turkey. This was really successful for her and led to an entire year of sobriety. But life threw a curve ball and due to some extremely hard circumstances surrounding our life, she relapsed and has found it difficult to continue to stay away.

Over the last few months she has expressed a want to change, I however do not know what I can do to help encourage her to do what is necessary.

It was also pretty easy to see his face in a few of the videos and we are fully convinced it‚Äôs him considering when we confronted him about it, really just messing with him not fully believing at this point, the account got deleted almost immediately.

Some details about my friend, he is one of the most straight people that I know. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs necessarily a good thing, I fully support gay people, but he is simply quite masculine and shows absolutely no sign whatsoever that he is gay. Although he has never had a girlfriend and has never really showed a great deal of interest in a particular girl, he makes comments about girls being attractive all the time. He is literally the last of my friends I would expect to do this, and if any of my friends just came out randomly and proceeded to act the same after the fact, I wouldn‚Äôt mind at all, but considering brad had a Twitter that posted some very NSFW stuff and asked certain people to do equally NSFW stuff to him, it‚Äôs all just very weird.

56,"Hi everyone, My name is Kyle and I‚Äôm 19 years old and I want to thank all of you personally for reading this post, I am going to try to be as honest as possible with myself in this. 

I come from an abusive background, my mother on drugs and neglectful and my stepdad physically and verbally abusive for 10+ years, my real dad not in the picture. As much as I don‚Äôt think this affects me today and I am over it, it may be the cause of some of these issues.

For the last few years i‚Äôve been trying to figure out what is wrong with me so I can seek help. I‚Äôd say my main issue is the inability to feel most emotions. I don‚Äôt get sad very often, I rarely feel guilt or strong connections towards people. For example, when I started this post I was feeling extremely sad, that lasted a whole 2 minutes and I feel better now, better meaning my normal emotionless state. I feel as if people close to me were to die I wouldn‚Äôt be upset (my dad, my mom, my grandmother.) In fact, I know I wouldn‚Äôt be upset. I would say ‚Äúdamn that sucks.‚Äù and life would go on. And I recognize that is a huge problem. These lack of emotions and connecting with people take an extreme toll on my relationships. I have had an amazing girlfriend for almost 2 years and she puts up with all of my bullshit but I can start to see it taking a toll on her. I don‚Äôt like to kiss, cuddle, or have sex. in fact I don‚Äôt like to do anything intimate at all. I feel very emotionally detached from her most of the time. But sometimes I feel extreme love and affection towards her but I have ZERO clue how to express this. I spend forever just thinking of the things to say, or what to do to show her and it‚Äôs gone as quickly as it came and I feel emotionally numb again. This causes her to feel like I don‚Äôt love her and I recognize this isn‚Äôt fair at all. I will feel this emotionally numb until she tries to leave or break up with me. This drives me absolutely insane. I will break things, cry, scream, hurt myself and do anything to make her come back. At the time I legitimately feel very sad and lonely as well as guilty for the way I acted that made her leave but the second she gives in and comes home, or even If I know she is on the way home I am back to feeling empty. She claims I‚Äôm just pretending to be sad to manipulate her and I really hope that isn‚Äôt the case. It‚Äôs a very scary thought to think I could be manipulating people when I think that I am feeling genuine emotion for once. I tend to age regress and pretend I am still a toddler age. (cuddle with big stuffed animals and things of that nature.) But I have never ever let anyone know or see that, it‚Äôs just to calm to me down. I feel the need to please women whenever I can to make them like me, give them money, buy them food, etc. I can‚Äôt keep a stable job. I try it out for a few days to a few weeks, sometimes walking out mid shift crying. I feel like all of my friends don‚Äôt know the real me. I feel like I just match my personality to who i‚Äôm hanging out with at the time to make myself more accessible to them. The things I am interested in I feel like nobody understands or wants to talk with me about, I love technology, cars, and music but I can see people get very bored when I start talking about things i‚Äôm passionate about, I am the type of person who always wants to know the answer to a question, and why something is the way it is and the reaction I get from most people is ‚Äúwhy, it‚Äôs not that serious.‚Äù and that‚Äôs very upsetting to me. cause talking about my interests is one of the few things I can put effort into.

64,"Please help me. I am getting married and I treat my fiance with utmost respect. She is my angel and the light of my life. I take care of her, provide for her, and make sure she has everything she needs. In turn, she is seven years younger than me, a very innocent, cute, petite catholic girl (I am her first) and she completely adores me. We support one another and we will be married within the year.

So here's the fucked up part. I constantly go behind my fiance's back and have the most hardcore and degrading sex with street prostitutes. I find the most worn out, desperate, drug addicted, and unwashed prostitutes that I can find. I abuse them. I pressure them into anal, oral, and vaginal sex without condoms. I fuck them hard and when they don't like it, it turns me on even more.

When I can't find streetwalkers, I go to strip clubs and watch violent and degrading porn. Not even porn. I like to watch videos of people degrading prostitutes, and even worse. I hang out on /r/watchpeopldie all the time and page through clip after clip of people being flayed alive, limbs cut off, hearts cut out while still beating, crushed in industrial machinery, etc. etc. I force myself to watch them from beginning to end, without looking away.

I honestly have no idea why I do this. I think it's because I was heavily abused all through childhood. I have been doing it since I was about thirteen, and it has become a really powerful drive. I am addicted to it.

When I was in college I discovered 4chan and it only escalated my behavior. I was terrified my first time I acted out my fantasies with a prostitute. I was a senior in college. She was addicted to Oxycontin and let me have anal sex with her after I paid her rent.

Each time it got easier and easier until it became the norm. After the initial rush wore off, I had to escalate my behavior in order to even raise my heart rate.

If my fiance knew it would destroy her completely. I love this girl and I have to deal with this problem before we get married. She is the only bright spot of wholesomeness in my life.

Please help me. I am genuinely afraid of myself and I feel like sometimes when my life is troubled this starts to spiral out of control. Please help. This is not a joke.

PS: I know what you're going to say. Yes, I even did therapy. I lied the entire way through. I was just too embarassed and ashamed to admit anything, and I wanted my therapist to think I was a good guy. I just made up some bullshit about being depressed, which was technically true, but I never told him the real reason why I was depressed.

I also have really violent fantasies about rape, voyeurism, and sex with underage girls. Nobody knows that I have this aspect of me. They all see me as such a nice guy, they don't see that I am actually a monster underneath the thin veil of humanity that I have to wear every day.

I think I am a sex addict. I think I might be kind of a Sociopath. But there's so many more aspects to it than that. Please help me. I know I am a bad person, I'm trying to stop myself, but I just can't seem to do it alone. I always end up regressing.",21Jan2019,1

I'm about to call up to talk about a symptom I didn't talk about in my initial assessment but I have a problem:

So when I phone up, I don't know whether to say ""hi, I forgot to talk about something, could you test me \_\_\_"" or to simply talk more about the symptom without making reference to another disorder.

I fit a lot of the symptoms, but not enough to qualify for a diagnosis. I know that NOT having BPD is good, because BPD is bad.

I self harm. I hate myself. I engage in certain risk taking/self destructive relations with men (seeking out men who tell me to hurt myself is one example). I'm sad a lot. I have no friends whatsoever. I'm diagnosed with social phobia. But the psychiatrist isn't offering a treatment plan for these things. She is talking about discharging me.

74,"So my boyfriends youngest sister (we‚Äôll name her Emily) is 23 and currently doing a uni course. Because this course takes up a lot of her time, she‚Äôs unable to get a job so her parents give her money for travel and food. 
When Emily does get the odd free night, she‚Äôll go on a mad one and spend all of whatever‚Äôs in her purse on a night out, buying endless rounds of drink for herself and whoever is with her, which then angers her parents as she‚Äôs wasted her money and they end up having to replace the money she needed for food and travel. 
To my knowledge, Emily was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago but is no longer taking medication for it. From my point of view, her family (older brother, older sister, mum, dad) don‚Äôt really have an understanding of mental health, and I‚Äôve tried helping my boyfriend understand Emily‚Äôs depression and how to talk to her about it, but I‚Äôm pretty certain he and his family still think Emily is faking it and aren‚Äôt being as careful with their words as I perhaps would be. The family also mentioned that Emily does lie a lot, of which I‚Äôve seen her get caught out on in the past. 

Anyway, everything seemed fine with Emily until this past weekend, of which she had her birthday. Her parents had explained she went out on Friday night and spent every last penny on drinks for her and her friends, ended up losing her phone, then triggered a huge argument when her dad arrived at the time she wanted picking up to go home. According to the father, Emily upset the father verbally about his failed businesses etc then ended up hitting him four times in the face whilst he was driving. 
Emily apparently exaggerated a lot of what happened from her point of view and said that her dad beat her up (which her other sister, mum and dad denied). She also mentioned her dad bruised her face and neck black but I couldn‚Äôt see these bruises on Saturday when we went out for dinner with the family for her birthday. 
Anyway, Emily was being super sweet and chatty with everyone as per usual, until we were all speaking about how we don‚Äôt speak to each other much lately and we should all make the effort to just pick up the phone more. This is when Emily, for no apparent reason, turned straight to her sister and said ‚Äúthe only time I‚Äôll make the effort to talk to you is when you‚Äôre six feet under‚Äù. It completely took me by surprise as the sister wasn‚Äôt really contributing much to the conversation anyway, and before this episode, Emily was always the peacemaker and would always be the one introducing people to others and sparking up conversations. My boyfriend didn‚Äôt seem too phased by it, and said to me ‚Äúsee what I mean now?‚Äù.

Last night (Sunday) the Dad drove Emily to the train station so she could head back to her place, and during the drive he told her that he was worried and that she should tell him if she wanted to talk to a professional. He also asked Emily to apologise for her behaviour that weekend, to which Emily told him if he asks her to apologise again she‚Äôll call the police. She also told the family that I and a random friend of my boyfriend and I also hate the family (which we obviously do not). 

Emily is coming up to stay with my boyfriend and I on Tuesday, and I‚Äôm hoping to try talk to her about this all. Any help or pointers in the right direction as to how to start tackling this would truly be appreciated!

75,"I always do worse on weekends but I have REALLY struggled this past weekend. Last night I just balled up on my bed and cried. I felt this deep emptiness inside of me and I don‚Äôt know how to fill it. Then I got to thinking... could it have anything to do with smartphones/the internet? 

I may sound crazy but it seems like depression and anxiety has gotten WAY more common over the years. I wonder if it is because our society has changed so much. We are glued to a reality that doesn‚Äôt have face to face interaction as much as our society once did. Maybe it is affecting us. I am thinking about getting rid of my smartphone and getting an old school flip phone again. Maybe that way I wouldn‚Äôt be glued to Facebook, reddit, Instagram, or whatever else.

77,"Hi there. This is my first time posting on reddit and I just finally got around creating an account. I'm writing this on mobile so forgive me for any errors. This would be a pretty long post so I'll thank you now if you do decide to stick around untill the end. 

I'm turning 23 in a couple of months. I'm an albino, and I don't have many friends. I live in the PH. I've been bullied a lot growing up and now as an adult, I struggle to keep eye contact and make genuine connections with new folks. As you might have already guessed, I got an incredibly low self esteem which I think has been the root of all my insecurities in life. 

My mother is diabetic. What little is left from my salary, I send back home for her insulin and other meds. She already lost viision on her left eye, and I fear that the other one will go next soon. She is also losing strength in her legs, and she now relies on her cane to get around.

I quit my first real job  (outsourcing industry in this country is really big) writing product descriptions for ecommerce sites last December. I couldn't stand the office politics, commute (traffic in Manila is hell), and my immediate head was a total ass (demanded more workload with the same pay, and took all the credit for the team's performance).  

I went back home to try my hand at remote, home-based jobs. That way, I can escape the commute and be much closer to family. I just finished my first ever online interview a few hours ago. The company does web development, branding, ecommerce sites/dropshipping, and most of the products that they deal with are adult toys. They'd pay around 600 USD for a month of 40-hour workweeks. That is really beyond entry level pay in my country, with new graduates earning as low as 250 USD a month. 

Problem is that we are talking about sex toys here. I know I can learn as much as I need about these things to write a half decent shopify product description of a fucking butt plug. I know these things are perfectly fine and are not at all taboo in the western cultures, but in here, it is like I'd be crucifying Christ himself if I do take on the job. And I don't think I will live to take on more pressure in my life right now.

Now I've dealt with a lot of pain and frustration and loneliness my entire life, but nothing comes close to the horror of just thinking of the day she goes blind. There is so much anger and sadness inside of me. I see my classmates and friends living their lives, going on vacations, buying stuff without ever worrying about a thing in the world and I fall deeper down the hole of envy and self-loathing.

I'm a mess. I need some input, people. How can I stop feeling the way that I do? How do I force myself to get it together? If you were in my shoes, what would you do to turn your life around? 

Should just take the job and completely disregard what this will do to my self-worth?",21Jan2019,1

80,"I stopped seeing my psychiatrist in August because I was tired of being treated like a child. He had a very heavy accent and raised his voice a lot, sometimes snapping at me. He looked at my case file and decided what medication I needed without even consulting me, then appeared irritated when I was reluctant to switch. He made me take a $3000 urine test before he prescribed me anything without giving me a little ‚ÄúHey, why don‚Äôt you make sure insurance will cover this‚Äù. He took me off of Paxil for a week right after ramping the dose up by 10 more milligrams. It ruined my life for months. For those of you who haven‚Äôt experienced Paxil withdrawal, look it up. It is hell. Went back to see him, shaking, delirious, and vomiting, and he doesn‚Äôt know what could possibly be wrong since ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù.

It‚Äôs a low-income clinic. That‚Äôs the only way I can rationalize it. 

He wouldn‚Äôt put me back on Paxil so I had to get my next bottle from my GP, who I started seeing in May. It‚Äôs September now, and I run out of Buspar. I call the clinic and they send her an email. I figure since it‚Äôs on my chart and she knows about it, I can expect to get it at the pharmacy in a couple days. 

I don‚Äôt hear anything back. 

After two weeks, and I run out of the medication. I think I‚Äôm fine for a little while‚Äì maybe just a bit anxious‚Äì until I run into a trigger and I get a few anxiety attacks. Like real, full-blown ones. I didn‚Äôt know I was experiencing a diluted version until I was completely off the Buspar for a bit. Worried, I call into the clinic again and they send her another email. No response, of course. 

So, I‚Äôve been living with the attacks. I was afraid to seek out another psychiatrist. I really thought my GP was just missing the emails because my pediatrician had prescribed all of these for me for years without hesitation when my first psychiatrist retired. I visited my GP in person after a car accident in October. I remembered to bring up the Buspar thing and she tells me to just call my pharmacist so they could send a request to refill to the clinic. I leave and thank her, do everything she says, and realize that I can‚Äôt get Buspar from her because she hadn‚Äôt prescribed it originally. This is in October. 

Skip forward to November. The car crash made it hard to breath, walk, everything. I am unmedicated for anxiety. I‚Äôm living alone in a college dorm miles away. I speak to someone maybe once a week. My mental state is declining. Did I mention I tried to hang myself in August? Well, it was in that same room. I‚Äôd think about it every time I looked at the ceiling. I don‚Äôt try to find a new psychiatrist. I stop going to therapy. Life sucks, and I don‚Äôt wanna live it. Paxil withdrawal threatens me like a gun to the head if I don‚Äôt get my next bottle. I let it all just happen to me because I don‚Äôt know I deserve any better. 

I moved back home in mid December. My parents are concerned. I lost 15% of my body weight. My BMI is 16.5. I feel weak and sick every day. Anxiety improves a little after moving back and I think I can just go without the Buspar for a little longer. 

That is, until this week. I‚Äôm a major hypochondriac and right now I think I must have brain cancer. I‚Äôve had attacks almost every day this week. I passed out in the shower yesterday and luckily sustained no injuries. My shower thoughts aren‚Äôt fun and quirky. Me passing out increased said anxiety of brain cancer and made me sick to my stomach. I had enough last night and called the clinic. They said they‚Äôd send her an email, like always. 

But this time, she responded and I got a call back. The people at the desk said I‚Äôd have to go back to that psychiatrist. She gave me a hard ‚Äúno‚Äù. 

Now, if she had said ‚Äúno‚Äù in September instead of bullshitting me, I would‚Äôve found a new psychiatrist by now. It took four months to see the awful one. You guys should know how bad it is to schedule with psychiatrists. 

It must be that they‚Äôre nervous to handle psychiatric medication. These aren‚Äôt antipsychotics we‚Äôre talking about. This is 7.5mg of Buspar (not a controlled substance). That‚Äôs the lowest dose and I took it once a day instead of the recommended twice. It isn‚Äôt crack I‚Äôm trying to get here. 

If she‚Äôs so worried about liability, she could‚Äôve, I don‚Äôt know, referred me to a *psychiatrist.* 

I told the people at the desk to remind her that I don‚Äôt have one and I really need it. I‚Äôm waiting for a call back. She doesn‚Äôt need to worry about me coming back. I‚Äôll never see her again. ",21Jan2019,1

83,"I've been suffering from social anxiety for about five years, in addition to PTSD from a violent altercation for almost two, coupling with severe depression. It's been an impossible struggle. I've seen dozens of therapists, counselors, and psychologists, taken uncountable combinations of medications. 

I managed to make some progress over the last year, making a few friends, going on a few dates for the first time in my life (though they went nowhere I was still proud of myself). I even went to a start of semester party (the first of been to in my year of college), even getting up and singing some Johnny Cash on the karaoke machine. I ran off and threw up afterwards (I wasn't drunk, before you ask). People are still complimenting me about it. Going to the gym helped me start to lose weight and the physical exertion made me feel happy. I even went back to church for the first time in a long time (that was the source of my PTSD). I felt like I was finally pulling myself out of hell.

But two weeks ago I broke my humerus on the way to classes. It was a really bad break, and I've been in constant pain since. The break itself doesn't bother me, I can get through pain, it's the fact that I can't do anything. I feel useless. I could finally see daylight and just got pulled back to the depths. I can't exercise. I can't write. I can't play many videogames. I can't drive. I can hardly walk. I can't work. I can't donate blood (something i used to do regularly feel good about myself). I have to rely on the rare goodwill of my roommates to leave the apartment for food or for doctor's appointments. They don't want to help, so I've been walking most places. They don't understand that I can't clean my dishes (no dishwasher) until I heal a bit more. Everyone keeps trivializing the injury. It's always ""boo hoo, you broke your arm. I did that as a kid and it wasn't so bad"". No one considers the fact that, just like my mental illnesses I'm fighting this battle alone, I don't have a support group, I don't have my parents to help. 

 All of my old coping tactics are impossible. I've lost all my progress, and it's only going to get worse, as I can't get out of this brace for 5 or 6 more weeks. I've gotten into some really bad levels of sheer despair. I've had invasive thoughts of suicide, which I haven't felt in almost a year. Every day is a struggle to stay sane. I doubt if I can get through this, and even if I do I'm not sure if I can start over again. I just wanted a place to vent, but if anyone has advice on how to keep myself afloat I'll owe you my life.",21Jan2019,1
84,"First off I would like to point out that this is not about depression. I am not depressed. Like all of us, I do live with anxiety, and I also have OCD. I am a 22 year old male.

For the last few months I haven't been feeling like myself. I feel distant from myself. I catch myself daydreaming a lot now when I never really used to when I was younger. I also tend to forget little things. For example, this morning I had to of plugged in my phone to let it charge but when I sat down at my desk and looked behind me I didn't remember doing so. Or bringing up the laundry and throwing it on my bedroom floor. I'm also forgetting things easily to write in this post as I'm typing it. Little things like that. It's not everything, and it's not all the time that I'm forgetting but I am aware that I am.  

My chest hurts sometimes, right above my heart. Or maybe it's my actual heart, I don't know. It's sort of like a shock feeling. Nothing too bad, it doesn't interfere with whatever I'm doing at the time it happens. I've never had a heart attack so I can't compare it to that, but it doesn't make me stop what I'm doing to hold my chest and catch my breath. My doctor had told me it's a common thing when you have anxiety or you're feeling nervous. I don't know if that's the case though.

My head seems to hurt sometimes as well. Not like a headache or a migraine, but almost as if someone knocks on my head. Not really hard, but enough for it to be annoying.

I feel nervous about going to work as well and I don't know why. It's a slow time at the place I work and I'm only working part time there so I don't have many shifts right now, and when I do have to go in I'm nervous. I've been there a year so I don't know why I would feel nervous about it.

It may be worth mentioning that I've had an ingrown toenail in my big toe for quite some time now, I've got it taken out once and a few months later it grew back in. I haven't been back to the foot doctor since. I know I should, but I've been busy lately. I don't know if that would have anything to do with how I'm feeling.

Like I said, I feel distant from myself, but it doesn't feel like I'm watching myself or anything like that. Whatever actions I make I know it's me making them. If I walk or move my leg or my arm or whatever it is I'm doing I know, in my mind, it is me.

Lastly I just wanted to say thank you to anyone who reads this post, and maybe at least someone has a clue to what it is I'm going through.",21Jan2019,1

also, there has been shit tons of work to catch up on after the holidays. preparing for finals at the end of the year (A Levels for you uk peeps), and feeling fucking unprepared.

and lets not get started on love... really have eyes for someone but felt like we have only drifted further apart recently. really hoping this changes.

86,"I would like to improve my mental health and get to a better place. 

I've always suffered from some sort of social anxiety. I don't know if I can actually call it that, because I've never been diagnosed, but I do get very nervous in social situations, like talking in front of a crowd or just even in class; I'm not good at making friends or small talking or talking to anyone I don't know; I'm constantly afraid of what people are going to think of me.   
I've had three anxiety attacks in my life, two of those were school related and one was during an overall bad and overwhelming week.  
I go through periods where I have no will to do anything and spend my days using my phone or just laying in bed. They can last from a few days to a few weeks.   
I've never planned or seriously taken into consideration suicide, but I do think often about it. I would never have the courage to do it.

I've talked about all this only with my boyfriend, since he's the only support system I have (which is bad, I know). He's understanding and supportive, but of course he doesn't really know how to help me.

I hoped things would change after finishing high school (school was really bad for me, I've always been good and got the best grades, and I've always suffered from the pressure and expectations that come with it - mostly from myself), but now I've started university and, although I like what I'm studying, I don't like going there because I spend the whole day by myself and it is really tiring and disheartening. 

Seeking professional help is unfortunately not an option because I go to an expensive school and I don't want my parents to pay for that as well. Moreover, I would have to talk to them about this, and I don't feel comfortable enough to do it.

So, my question is: is there a way for me to improve my mental health? As in actual, concrete steps I can take to feel better.",21Jan2019,1
87,"Mind trap masterpost
This is a translation of what my therapist gave me a few months ago and it has helped me a lot with stopping. Thinking. And then, reconsidering how I am feeling or what I am thinking before I either act on it or let it bury me. Overthinking, overanalyzing and reading into situations from a biased perspective is something I am highly guilty for, but I know I'm not the only one and thought I'd share what helped me, hoping that it will help someone else :)

List of mind-traps
There are several mind-traps people fall into, sometimes without realizing it before its too late. Here are 7 of them:

1. *All or nothing mindset*
You look at things as ""black"" or ""white"". If your accomplishments aren't perfect, you look at yourself as a failure. You collect all negative experiences.
""I'm ugly if I'm not as pretty or prettier than the prettiest""
""my speech was total crap because I stumbled on some words""
""I am stupid because I didn't complete this test we'll enough""

2. *overgeneralizing*
You look at a negative occurance as a pattern that never ends.
""she doesn't wanna see me, no one will""
""I will be lonely my entire life""
""I will die alone""
""I will never be capable of....""

3. *Disqualifying the positive*
You reject positive esperiences by saying they don't count. This way you maintain your negative assumptions which otherwise would be contradicted by daily experiences. 
""but that assignment was easy"" 
""I must've had a good day"" 
""I was lucky, wait until next time and you'll see"" 

4. *Reading minds*
You randomly conclude that people think negatively of you, and you don't care about figuring out if it's really true. 
""he doesn't like me"" 
""they think I'm boring"" 
""they aren't really interested in what I'm saying"" 

5. *interpreting fate*
You have a presumption that things will go wrong and you feel convinced that your presumptions are facts. 
""I won't be able to do, say, write, eat something at all"" 
""my voice will Crack and everyone will hear it"" 
""I will panic"" 

6. Emotional reasoning 
You assume that your negative emotions reflect things as they really are.
""it feels like this thus it must be true"" 
""I am so nervous that others probably think bad things about me"" 
""I feel stupid so I probably look stupid"" 
""I feel so anxious, this will probably not go very well"" 

7. Shall-statements
You give yourself requirements that you ""shall, must, will, have to"". You can't live up to your standards which are too high, and you often feel hurt, inadequate or guilty. 
""I have to always be perfect"" 
""I must always be capable of saying the right things"" 
""I must always have control""


Whenever you realize you are falling into one of these mind-traps, ask yourself the following questions to start unwinding the cluster of thoughts that are overpowering you or sending you into a spiral. 

Testing of the negative automatic thought:

1. What kind of proof do I have for this thought to be correct?
2. What kind of mind-trap do I fall into?
3. Am I taking hasty decisions?
4. Which alternative viewpoints are there to this?
5. What would someone else, who know me well, say?
6. What would I have told my best friend, if he/she were thinking like this?
7. What speaks against my way of thinking?
8. What have I experienced from similar occurances in the past?
9. What is the worst that could happen?
10. What is the best that could happen?
11. What is the most realistic result? 




I hope this will help you reflect and stop yourself from falling into the depths of your own imagination. 
In my experience it felt silly and worthless at first, but after I did it a few times I would start noticing that I was spiraling earlier in the process which helped me guide my thoughts to a more productive and logical rather than emotional direction.  I hope this can assist you to do the same :)

I have just a few stuff left and then I will be done with my degree and a few weeks ago I was so excited. I studied easy courses for over half a year and then been working for a half year due to not wanting to have a breakdown. I have not really been studying on 100% for almost two years

Today we met up for the last course and my new class is a mess. Half the class is on sick leave due to stress and the rest of them is looking like they are on the verge of giving up. We started of big and I have 3 documents that I need to read untill tomorrow, one of them I got in an email around 18.00 and hearing that I need to have read it through and made bullet points about the key concepts before 10.00 tomorrow. We have not even started yet and I'm freaking out

I thought my boyfriend would be supportive when I got home but he is just grumpy. He did not even ask how my first  day was. And, i know that it is stupid, but it feels like it is my fault that he is in a bad mood and I'm tipping around on my toes so not to make him worse since I'm not in the right mood to handle him being more annoyed at me. There is so much that needs to be done at home as well that I thought he would take care off since he is not working today.

97,"  

Learning to feel again has been hell. Real emotions are powerful and unpredictable and obvious. It‚Äôs hard to hide how you feel when haven‚Äôt felt for so long. Sometimes, the emotion is too powerful, and my brain defaults to crying as a coping mechanism. Learning to feel again, to cope with such extremes of emotion, you may be forgiven for thinking that sadness is the hardest part of it all. It is not however; the hardest emotion to relearn is actually happiness. 

I am a man in his mid-thirties, and 2018 was a rollercoaster year of extremes, some ups and lots of downs. My marriage broke down and at first, I fought for it until I broke down and there was no more fight left. I was fired illegally from a job I‚Äôd held for less than a year, and was told by the pro-bono law firm that sought to represent me that my case didn‚Äôt make financial sense for them to take on, which left me no option but to accept the blot on work record. My ex-wife left our home whilst I was coming back from work on the day I had been fired, leaving only a text message to outline her selfish reasons for doing so. The blot on my work record then prevented me from applying for a dream job in law enforcement. A different company provided a reference that, whilst not ‚Äòbad‚Äô, cast enough doubt with another police force that I lost a civilian job offer literally days before I was due to start training. I was so broke I was relying on handouts from family and friends to top up my benefits to keep the roof over my head. My debts to family and credit cards tripled in six months. Then, I got a new job and met a new partner at roughly the same time, and we had to decide whether to begin a relationship that would become long distance almost immediately; we did so knowing it wouldn‚Äôt be easy, but it would be worth it. I found a new place to live 150 miles away from ‚Äòhome‚Äô, my girlfriend, and the support network I had grown over nearly fifteen years since moving back after university.

Perhaps I was foolish to elect to come off my medication when I did. Perhaps I wasn‚Äôt as ready as I thought. Perhaps I was buoyed by counselling and jumped in too soon. I will never know. I doesn‚Äôt matter now either. I reduced my dosage incrementally, went through the withdrawal, and took my final tablet on December 31st; I also threw all my spares away.

So what has this to do with happiness? The tablets I took for almost seven years kept my mood stable, and prevented my sadness from overwhelming me when it was high (low?); they also kept a limit on my other emotions. As such, I haven‚Äôt really felt anything properly for a long time. I felt happy during that time yes, but the medication stunted it into a kind of perma-contentment. I freely acknowledge that my depression was mild, and I never felt suicidal or drawn to self-harming; I know I was lucky in this regard. Yet, the years of stunted emotions mean that now, when I feel content or satisfied with something, it feels powerful like an extreme happiness; and, when I experience that kind of profound happiness that comes from feeling in control of your life and going where you *want* to go, feeling as though the things you wanted and wished for, and deserve, are coming to you at last, a happiness that lifts you and from which it feels you not come down, it is almost a euphoria I cannot cope with. It is often so intense that it scares me, and leaves me prone to the old, bad, habits of self-depreciation and self-sabotage.

January has, thus far, been a month of intense emotions. My brain gets more and more SSRI free, and is being allowed to regulate its own chemicals; my feelings are having the lid taken off, their limiter is being removed. There is sadness this month yes. I am sad because I live apart from my girlfriend by over 100 miles. I am sad because I must rely on social media to speak to my friends. I am sad because the building into which I moved does not allow pets and I wanted to adopt a cat! But I am using what my counsellor taught me to cope with and process this sadness, and it is working. There is more happiness this month, and it is this happiness I am finding hardest. 

I have much to be happy about, amongst other things I am employed and have a home. I have friends that I can know I can call on regardless of where we are in the world. I have love in my life even if my partner and I are geographically apart. I am standing in front of two roads that lead to two similar dream careers, both extremely well paid, deeply meaningful, and with excellent development prospects that will take me to retirement with a pension. I look at how much meaning and potential I have in my life once again and I am happy. And because I am happy, I cry. I cry because this happiness is more powerful that I can properly handle at this time. Sometimes, I can stave off the tears, and move my mind to new thoughts or tasks. But often I feel them roll down my cheeks as I sniffle. You would see me and think I am upset. But I am not. I am literally learning how to feel happy again, and it‚Äôs one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done.

My counsellor, who‚Äôs praises I can never sing high enough, taught me how to really understand that now famous phrase ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok to not be ok‚Äù. Over seven weeks, I learned more and more how to acknowledge how I felt when I was not ok, and to allow myself to feel that way; to validate and process the feelings in a healthy way. Had I the opportunity to see her now, I would ask that we did similar work on the phrase ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok to be ok too‚Äù. I am instead teaching myself that it *is* ok to feel happy. It‚Äôs ok to feel happy about going to work a job that gives meaning to your life. It‚Äôs ok to feel loved by someone who is thoughtful and caring and beautiful. It‚Äôs ok to feel excited by the future and the promise it holds, the potential for responsibility and good pay and excellent prospects right through until retirement. It‚Äôs ok to not be ok, and it‚Äôs ok to be ok too.

So I will continue to learn how to feel again. My life will move on, and things will change. One day I may learn one of my career options is closed and I cannot choose that road. Or my relationship may not last long term. Perhaps some of my friends will drift away and lose contact. It is equally likely that my dream career may happen all of sudden, or my relationship will bare a family and lifelong commitment, or I will gain new friends into my support network. I will experience losses, and I will experience gains. And I will experience these new, intense emotions, learning to make them more predictable and more bearable. As hard as it is to grasp at the moment, I will do this because I know, it is ok to be ok.",21Jan2019,1

102,"I've been struggling with some kind of mental health issue for over 10 years now and I'm just finally at the point where I'm so tired of dealing with it that I need to ask for advice. I'm in my mid 20's and nothing I've tried so far has made much of an improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't attempt to attach any labels to the way I feel as I've never visited a psychologist or any mental health professional and feel self-diagnosis is probably not the best idea. I would describe the issue as being constantly re-occurring, varying intensity emotional pain. It's there more often than it isn't, I can't identify any triggers, and as soon as it lifts I feel at peace. However, this pain comes on and just wears me down and I really can't deal with this constant cycle anymore. Sometimes these things come and go in half an hour. Other times they last days and up to weeks. The longest I'll ever go without it coming on to some degree is perhaps most of a day. At its lowest intensity, it feels like a mild feeling that something is wrong, or dissatisfaction with life - the feeling of just having a kinda shitty day. At its worst, it feels like I've just been told all the worst news I could possibly hear in one sitting and the strength of it is so intense that suicide as a way to just stop the pain becomes such an enticing idea. Over the years I've had this, I have managed to go from being legitimately suicidal (which culminated in a few 'attempts') to it not being an option at all, but the thoughts are still there and the pain that causes them is as strong as ever. I don't want to die, I just want the pain to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I always thought that once I'd achieved enough in life, got myself into a good spot, it would cease. Turns out I was dead wrong. I have everything I could possibly want and it's just left me feeling hopeless because I no longer have an idea of how to 'fix' this issue. I have tried my best to deal with this on my own. I've read countless psychology, self-help and philosophy books as a way to try understand why this happens to me, but I can't even scratch the surface. The best I've managed to get is that my abusive childhood probably did me no favours, but I don't harbour any issues I know about anymore in that area. I'm in pain, and I'm tired, and I really cannot find a single piece of insight into this. I almost feel like I'm going crazy. It's constantly affecting my everyday life and I'm so sick of feeling like I've just been stabbed in the chest when I'm staring into the face of my loved one who's doing her best to console me. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm in a tricky spot, too. I'm lined up for my dream job. The problem is that they do a background medical history check due to the sensitive nature of the role, and if I had any mental illness diagnosis on that history I strongly feel as if I wouldn't end up getting that job. Due to the way things are arranged in my life, if I don't land that job or one very similar, my life falls apart. Hence, I'm incredibly hesitant about enquiring towards seeing a mental health specialist right now. Give it a year, and I could probably get away with it unnoticed. I just don't know if I have the energy to wait another year.

104,"I will state before I begin that I do not have any clinical mental health issues, rather just a recent bout of anxiety that has been causing me grief. I'm posting here after weeks of frustration, relating to my lack of sex drive. Up until about 3 weeks, I would say that my sex drive was relatively normal. I watched porn pretty much everyday, and never had any problem getting aroused. However, this all changed following a burst of anxiety I had (unrelated to my sexuality), and ever since I have had a very difficult time becoming aroused at the thought of porn or women. Strangely enough, if I look at porn, I have no problem getting an erection, however, I do feel ""hollow"", and it just isn't as enjoyable for me as it used to be.

At the same time, I also had gnawing doubts about my sexual identity, which started a few months back after a friend of mine came out of the closet to me. I have never felt attraction to men, and thus pushed the thoughts away once I first had them. The questioning would come back sporadically, but it was easily dismissed. I think part of the reason is that I never told anyone about this information, and as a result, it remained bottled up since last August. This all changed a few weeks ago, and almost everyday I have been constantly barraged by questioning about my identity. In combination with the lack of sex drive for women, where I can't really get an erection unless I'm looking at porn, the past few weeks have been quite tough for me. I have felt fatigued and uncomfortable everyday, and can barely do other things because my head is constantly swirling. I have been going to therapy, and I have noticed that I have been getting better everyday, in terms of my head clearing up and regaining control of my thoughts, but I still have a weak sex drive.

Once again I should reiterate, I genuinely have no attraction towards men. Never in my life have I felt anything for men, and I don't even like to watch porn with men in it, as the sight of a penis turns me off. I recently tried to look at porn with penises in them, trying to entertain the idea that I might be bisexual, but all it did was reassert the fact that I only like women. I feel so frustrated because I went from being your average hormonal college student to basically a nervous wreck. Like I said earlier in this post, I‚Äôve been improving, but my sex drive still hasn‚Äôt rebounded. Is there anything I could do to help speed the process along?

106,"Brain fog is an informal umbrella term for a number of related symptoms that involve the sufferer's brain feeling slow and like it‚Äôs not functioning correctly, almost like it‚Äôs in a fog. Presentations can involve anything from memory problems to difficulty thinking to confusion. It can be caused temporarily by coming on or off of certain drugs and medications, but many cases are chronic. A lot of the time, chronic brain fog is caused by an underlying physical health condition or nutrient deficiency, but it can also simply result from stress or anxiety.

In the recent decades there has been a surge in awareness and acceptance of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, but chronic brain fog has been left to the wayside in these movements for what I believe are three reasons. 1. Brain fog is ambiguously defined and it can take so many different forms. Two cases tend to be very different from each other. 2. It is not very well known about by the general public and is called by a variety of different names in different cases. There are different names associated with different underlying physical conditions, for example: Fibro Fog, Lupus Fog, MS Fog, etc. and there are also many different synonyms for the condition itself such as cognitive disfunction, mental impairment, clouding of consciousness, etc. 3. There is less stigma surrounding it than the other conditions I mentioned, and stigma was one of the major motivations for spreading awareness of those conditions. People don‚Äôt make claims about people faking their brain fog for attention or give them useless advice like ‚Äújust be happy‚Äù in the same way as something like depression, however, there still tends to be a lot of misunderstanding that comes from people who have never experienced brain fog which is why it‚Äôs still important to spread awareness about.

Along with that, spreading awareness is important for those who are going through this and are unaware that they are not alone and that there are [communities on the internet](Reddit.com/r/brainfog) that are there to support them.

It‚Äôs sometimes difficult for neurotypicals to understand why brain fog makes life so difficult and why it is so soul sucking, which is what I‚Äôm going to attempt to explain in the rest of this post. When you don‚Äôt have brain fog, it‚Äôs easy to forget how much you need your brain in day to day tasks. Everything from talking to people, to doing work, to even just thinking idly requires some amount of brain function, so when your brain starts functioning below it‚Äôs normal level all of these things become a lot more difficult and mentally exhausting. Suddenly you find yourself looking at various things in your life with dread that you maybe used to look at with excitement or at least indifferently. It‚Äôs also not easy for others to see just how hard your brain has to work now to go about your life and they tend to be less empathetic towards your struggles than you sometimes need them to be, which can be isolating. Another major source of suffering comes from anxiety surrounding one‚Äôs brain fog. Since your brain is literally the organ that makes you you, it can be terrifying when it stops working and you can‚Äôt trust it anymore. Due to brain fog having so many possible causes, many times sufferers are clueless as to what the source of their brain fog is which can be even more scary. Many are left with the fear that their brains are permanently damaged and they will never recover. Doctors also tend to be dismissive of patients presenting with brainfog because there simply isn‚Äôt enough knowledge about it and it is difficult to find the cause. This is even more isolating.

108,"I have no confidence. I'm self conscious about everything. I've had a girlfriend for 3 months and just now I'm getting to the point where I can actually carry on a conversation with her (she asked me out via text because she knew i'd be too nervous to say yes in person, I have no clue why she's with me, but even her mom's texted me about how much happier my gf has been since being with me). I can barely talk to people. In a social situation I barely talk, someone will say something to me and sometimes I just nod my head and don't talk, which makes it awkward but I can't help it. Every time I go to a social event I tell myself in my head I should kill myself when I get home so people will think I'm not nervous but I'm just really depressed. It's really painful. I have friends but not many, they like hanging out with me but I feel so unnatural and so uncomfortable talking to them. What bothers me is how I can go off on my girlfriends mom because she acts like a 10 year old (long story), but not a single person knows my favorite song. I could go up to a random person and say something embarrassing on purpose and genuinely laugh about it, but I couldn't just have a normal conversation. The problem is things that should make me uncomfortable don't and things that shouldn't do, I don't get it. Should I seek therapy to help or something, I'm 16 and male by the way. I believe part of it is depression (I've been diagnosed) so I have no interest and get no joy out of talking to people, and part of it is also that I'm just really self conscious. I see no value in myself, I always try to justify people's behavior towards me, stuff like that. What should I do about it. I need to do something soon because life is just so boring and sad the only reason I'm still alive is because I know my girlfriend would be really sad if I died, and I know if I hold on eventually I'll feel confident enough and life will at least be bearable. Does anyone have anything they can tell me or any advice because it's actually starting to become so unbearable. I'm so fucking lonely, I go out and try to talk to people, I go whenever I'm invited places and I still don't have a single person I actually can feel comfortable around, even myself.

114,"Hello, 

These symptoms may seem like a rather common affect of lack of sleep. However, I am not sure if I am hyper sensitive to my mental state or if it is something more. I've read a lot about dopamine and serotonin and my guess is that my dopamine levels are lower than the average person. Alcohol (in larger quantities) augments these symptoms once the effects have worn off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figure someone on this forum is quite knowledgeable in neurobiology and I wanted to just post the question on this forum...

&amp;#x200B;

My symptoms generally include: depression, lack of interest and focus in activities that are generally of great importance to me, lack of motivation, feelings of sadness, and I'm often paranoid/hypersensitive when interacting with others. These symptoms are not always at once but definitely have occurred with some correlation. 

&amp;#x200B;

The odd part is, even in an exhausted state I still know that this is basically my brain running at a reduced state, so I am aware that its not my normal state of being and can sort of ""muscle"" my way through. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on why this may be occurring (in what seems to be a heightened state) would be great! 

On a final note: I am very physically fit and eat relatively well, exercise often helps these symptoms. 

Thank you!!!",21Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

anyway... as mentioned, I've been kind of depressed for a few months ago. I would say it is a mild depression + a lot of laziness. I went from going to school (3 years ago) to dropping out after my 1st year in college so I could start my own business but I slowly stopped caring and now I live with my parents and do nothing all day. the only productive thing i do is probably play some games and make my own food (which most of the time Im making some pasta noodles and putting cheese on it). I went from being excited to be independent (always wanted to be independent but here I am), to basically being a shell of a person. a lazy log. I stay home all day and play video games, eat, and sleep. my parents have given up on me basically and no longer nag me to do something. they were never encouraging of anything I did, and often insulted me for mygrades and the college I went into. I am not really close to my parents, but I am somewhat closer to my mom, as my father and I have a really bad relationship but we all still live together.

&amp;#x200B;

unrelated but comedically ironic: I used to look down on young adults who stayed home with parents and didnt have a job as I thought they were lazy and pathetic, and I've literally become my own worst fear.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway... so now that I basically do nothing all day and literally am super useless lol, whenever I get sick or hurt - at first I try to get better and heal myself / make sure that I do everything in my path to get better. but now when i realize im sick, I just sort of accept it and actually appreciate being sick or hurt because I feel like if im sick then it's because I'm sacrificing myself so others close to me don't have to suffer. that im taking away some of their pain/ sickness, so they suffer less. 

&amp;#x200B;

i think/ know it sounds really crazy that i've lost my mind, but at least that way i dont feel that worthless... and there is 1 in particular very close to me... i wont disclose who or what, but basically they are very sick and are dying. Ive been with them most of my life since I was a young child, and i try to do everythin I can to save them, but i know they are dying and will not live much longer. so because of that, I often pray that i get their sickness and pain so they can be pain free and not suffer, that I openly accept and WANT to be sick and hurt not for attention, but so i can take their place in sickness and suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

anyone have any advice for me? I don't know what i will do once that being dies, i dont know if i will continue to live or not. it's not that I'm in such a deep depression I'm suicidal, it's more like I've devoted my whole life to them and they helped me overcome depression before - and while I believe i can still find happiness and fulfillment after their death, i dont know if its worth the effort (as mentioned, im just lazy).

As of late - the past year or so - I've been feeling exhausted. School causes me tremendeous amounts of stress, so much, I have actually threw up and somehow got fever days prior to important exams, even though I aced them. My mother still struggles with mental illness, which she sometimes takes out on me.

To see just how disfunctional my family is - my parents are actually letting my 20y/o boyfriend to live with us.

My one ""escape"" would be music, which I absolutely love. However, I'm bad at it. I'm average at guitar, drums and uke and a terrible singer. Everytime I try practicing I realize just how absolutely terrible I am, even though I spent a good part of my childhood isolated from other kids and focused on practicing instruments and singing for 5-8hours a day - which would be literally all of my free time. Realizing how bad I am after so much practice makes me feel absolutely useless. I hate it. It manages to make me cry everytime, sometimes several times in a day. My bf, who is a singer, literally never practices, but is really good at singing - that upsets me even more. He doesn't put in any effort while I do and he gets so much more out of it.

I don't know what to do. All I ever think about is what a disappointment I am to myself. I've tried everything, but I can't seem to get better.

This was way before I was hallucinating 24/7. It's been happening for probably 3/4 months now. Whenever I look at something, whatever I'm looking at (including peripherals) looks like it's moving/morphing/distorting. I've been looking for a visual aid for ages and have only just found one - [this is the best visual representation I've come across that shows what happens pretty much constantly](https://gfycat.com/BountifulUnluckyCowrie) (0.5x speed is the most accurate).

Sometimes when I'm lying in bed, the ceiling above me looks and feels like it's getting closer and closer to me, but is obviously not moving, but the more I looked, the more and more intense it felt. It's affected my sleep a couple of times in the past week too, as I see shapes in the darkness in my room due to the constant morphing. 2 nights ago I seen what looked like the silhouette of many octopus tentacles moving around on the ceiling in total darkness. 

Does anyone else experience this? I don't know if it's just my eyes playing tricks or if my mental health is getting worse. I smoke weed every day (for the past 6 months or so) and have done recreationally for years and have never hallucinated from weed before. Obviously it's not a good idea to do any drug every day, but I'd be dead without it. I turn into an unstable mess without it. It's taken like 12 years of basic, free NHS talking therapies, suicide attempts, drug abuse etc to get taken seriously, and I'm now on the list for a mental health assessment, so hopefully I should find out what's going on soon. 

Apologies for the train wreck of a post, I'm just a bit worried atm.

TL;DR Pretty much everything in my field of vision does [this](https://gfycat.com/BountifulUnluckyCowrie) every time I look at something, does anyone else get similar things when they hallucinate? Is it a big cause for concern? Am I having a psychotic break or something?",21Jan2019,1

Scheduling time for doctors is next to impossible, even with night hours, we have work and she is a teacher so taking days and time off is a difficult thing to do and she is just adding to her anxiety about not be a good teacher and worry about getting fired because she has to take off.

Actually calling and scheduling, even assuming that there is time, is a very stressful scenario as well. No one answers, people say they will call back and never do, appointments get cancelled (after she calls off work, so she doesn't get another chance to go for weeks), have to leave tons of voicemails that never get responded to because the specialist is out or the doctors leave at 2 pm. 

When there actually is a appointment met, nothing helps because they are blocked by another specialist. Sorry can't help need to talk to your psychiatrist, sorry looks like you need to get an MRI for us to help with the leg pain, sorry you need to find a therapist to sign off on this.

And each one is it's own hell of a fetch quest. The problems she's having make it hard to even go to the grocery store without having a panic attack, she's in so much physical pain she just cries every night, then lapsing into a panic attack because she can't tell if it's physical or mental pain.  

And people experiencing these issues are expecting to schedule dozens of appointments with people that have unclear schedules while she maintains her job every day? Also have to throw in insurance and money into the mix. Finally finding a doctor that understood but then getting denied coverage is another thing to add to the pile.

I have no way to help. I don't know what to do besides offer comfort. I'm not trained in this. I can't just keep saying go to a doctor, see a therapist, when we've been going through this nightmare of finding help for years. And more health issues just keep coming up. 

She just keeps saying it's not fair, and it's not. She builds up energy for days trying so hard to fight through the pain and mental pressure, just to make it to a doctors appointment which is cancelled the day of. She spends weeks trying to schedule an appointment with her psychiatrist, which keeps going to voicemail, and not getting calls returned. When she asked her general practitioner for help, they call the psychiatrist in the office, her answers and says he'd be happy to schedule time. So she looks like a crazy person looking for drugs. We leave the office at 2pm (appointment scheduled for 11:30, we sat waiting for the doctor for 50 minutes after the nurse checked blood pressure), and call the psychiatrist who has left the office for the day. At 2pm. Been over a week and still can't contact them. Has to go through withdrawal now because she's been cut off cold turkey from an antidepressant (That apparently she was never supposed to be on, it was just supposed to be an attempt at lessening the physical pain of what they guess is Fibromyalgia, they have no idea why she hurts)

If she didn't have me next to her, she'd probably think she's going insane, with someone actively making sure nothing ever works out. But I can't help, I can only just watch and give hugs (when she's able to be touched since her skin hurts quite often).

Our home brings with it an undeniable feeling of familiarity and comfort. We can be out all night having the time of our lives when, all of a sudden, have a yearning to ‚Äújust go home.‚Äù But is our home actually a covert catalyst of anxiety?

Let us begin by exploring the *Biophilia Hypothesis* for a moment. It was proposed by naturalist, biologist, and author Edward O. Wilson in 1984 in the book *Biophilia*. ¬†The Biophilia hypothesis, or ‚ÄúBET,‚Äù is the notion that human beings possess an inherent, intimate connection with nature. Modern society‚Äôs current ways of living ‚Äì heavy industry (and pollution), obsession with money, addiction to technology ‚Äì has effectively separated us from our former abode, causing a conflict in the subconscious.

Wilson‚Äôs theory makes sense when viewed from an evolutionary perspective. Not long ago, man lived out amongst the elements, save for rudimentary shelters like caves and tree branches. When not resting, you would find the men, women, and children outdoors, hunting and gathering for food, water, and other necessities of daily life.

#### What does the Biophilia Hypothesis have to do with home-induced anxiety?

Well, if Mr. Wilson is indeed correct, **our home is separating us from our original habitat** ‚Äì and no species is okay with exile! ¬†Another idea is that *nature signifies life and vitality*. Indeed, plants and trees ‚Äì two of the most commonly-found things in nature ‚Äì *permit* life; a fact that may help explain why we find flowers and plants adorning most homes and workspaces. The hypothesis may help explain why many people feature nature at the centerpiece (if you will) of their homes ‚Äì a concept known as *biophilic design*.

In other words, as *Mammalia*, we human beings ‚Äì despite our advanced intelligence and, for some, vehement insistence to the contrary ‚Äì inherently desire to return to our original home out in the elements. As a side note, Wilson‚Äôs hypothesis gathers steam when you consider that**humans are the only species who do not actively reside in the natural world.**

At the very least, the Biophilia Hypothesis makes us think about our relationship with nature. Whether it explains away the deep-rooted anxiety that some (all?) experience in the home is up to the psychoanalytical among us.

The Biophilia Hypothesis aside, we *do* know that **one‚Äôs environment can influence their state of mind**. Given that the home is indeed an environment, it is reasonable to assume that it can spur anxious feelings, but why? Here are 9 possible ways that your home can give you anxiety:

1. **Your place is cluttered and disorganized**

Okay, so check these numbers out. Per a survey of more than a thousand Americans over 18 years old, 47 percent constantly worry about the orderliness of their home. Also, scientists know that **too much clutter raises cortisol levels**. Per Psychology Today, the stress hormone cortisol ‚Äúis public enemy number one,‚Äù with high levels of the hormones causing disturbances in learning and memory, immune system, metabolism, and more.

*What to do: Start small by organizing your bedroom closet or kitchen drawers. Eventually, begin thinking bigger and take on more time-consuming projects. The enemy of anxiety is action. Take it.*

134,"I've never given any thought to mental health at all until recently. The last couple of years I've found myself being emotional and crying for various reasons be that really missing family that have passed away or even just feeling lonely, even though I still have plenty of family and friends to spend time with &amp; I've never really spoken about how I am with anyone so I am really nervous writing this because I feel a little silly writing about that I'm happy or it may come across as I'm fishing for attention or something. I feel like I need to express myself though so here it is....

&amp;#x200B;

This past weekend a really random event caused me to think and come to a realisation. The weather here in Northern Ireland has now started to get quite cold and I thought I could do with a new coat so I did some online window shopping, picked one out and went to the shop to pick it up &amp; also picked up a nice steak to make for dinner that Saturday night. Yesterday, in what I am certain is a sign of getting old I started looking forward to trying this coat out in the terrible weather we have come Monday morning &amp; it put a smile on my face.

&amp;#x200B;

Smiling got me thinking on why I was feeling happy about it and realised it wasn't just that, even though I hadn't done anything particularly spectacular or awesome in terms of activities I thought I'd had a pretty damn good weekend. On Saturday I bought myself a nice new coat, I got to spend a good bit of time playing &amp; having fun with my 3 year old nephew, an activity which is probably my favourite thing in the world these last couple of years &amp; was then able to have a lovely meal. On top of that I was able to watch some TV shows that I really love, got some gaming in &amp; got a chance to relax some as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I got to do some of the things I most enjoy and managed to realise that whilst I have days here and there that I may feel lonely or sad about missing people or one of the many other emotions that take hold, I overall am pretty happy and allowed myself to feel good about it. On days where I maybe do feel a little down I hope I can remember the little things that do make me happy and can embrace those.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have taken the time to read this then thank you &amp; hopefully if reading this has reminded you of something small that even brings back a happy memory from some small thing then I'd be very glad indeed.",21Jan2019,1
135,"This is quite weird for me asking to be honest. I'm not the kind of person to talk about this kind of stuff openly but I just feel I need to right now. I used to really suffer mentally. In hindsight I really should have got on medication but I chose not to out of fear of actually admitting I needed it. I never got diagnosed as both my mum and I frankly didn't want to admit it was any worse than stress but I certainly was. There were times between 2015 and 2016 I questioned whether there was even any purpose to life as I just couldn't imagine anything being worse. But by early 2018 through self reflection and therapy I did improve and even now I am a hell of a lot better than I ever was then. I just remember it coming on in waves and feeling almost trapped in what felt like a box of, well the closest thing I could say is of despair. At the time I even felt embarrassed as I knew exactly what was happening but I couldn't do anything about it. This was a few years ago though so I can't remember exactly what went through my head at the time. It happened probably once or twice a day. Although I've felt better for a long time, in the last couple weeks I have had this sadness come on over me. It's different from before and no where near as bad but I seemed to have lost all drive and motivation. There are bits of desperation at times but for the most part it's just a feeling of melancholy. It is becoming more frequent and I just have to wonder what it could be any what I should do. ",21Jan2019,1
136,"I was speaking to a close relative the other day about mental health and suicidal thoughts. I explained that I don't think I've ever had suicidal thoughts more than the usual, as in I've thought about killing myself in terms of jumping in front of a train as one pulls up at the station, jumping off a motorway bridge as I walk over one or steering my car into oncoming traffic. I never thought of these as suicidal thoughts because they are just ""I could do that"" things that pop into my head and I thought everyone gets them. As for my other mental health issues, I suffer from anxiety and it has gotten worse recently but not too bad. Are these suicidal thoughts and should I see someone or does everyone get these?

137,"I don‚Äôt know where else to post this but I‚Äôd like to get to the bottom of it and a psych/mental health sub might be somewhere to start? I‚Äôll remove the post if it really doesn‚Äôt belong here

This happened like 7 years ago. I've always regarded it as an ""episode‚Äù. I‚Äôve wondered if it‚Äôs some sort of synesthesia but I can‚Äôt be sure. 



One night, I was with friends at a small house party and we were all drinking. I think I got considerably tipsy -- like the loose level of drunk where you're a lot more fun but not out of control. Gradually, people stopped being people in my head. They turned into two lines connected at one point and divided by different angles (think: 7th-grade geometry homework); if they moved they were vectors. The angle degrees and length of their lines were different for every person. IIRC, some were even triangles. It was a party, so people were talking. But I didn't see talking. I saw mathematical operations as the interactions happening between them. Multiplication, division, subtraction or addition, depending on the emotion they were speaking with. (Example: if they were laughing loudly, they were multiplying with each other).



It was so weird and so overwhelming. I tried to explain it to one friend but I think she thought I was crazy. It was impossible to stop thinking like this. It only wore off when I fell asleep, which ALSO was difficult to do. It was verging on too stimulating. 



I realize this isn't really synesthesia as I didn't ""feel"" this in a sensory way, but if it's not synesthesia then what the hell happened? I don't think it means anything, especially because it's never happened that intensely again, but if anyone has any insight I'd appreciate it lots.

You looked me in the eye and told me it was over, that you were not happy anymore, that if you would have stayed with me any longer that you would have cheated on me.

Before doing something relatively small, like putting dishes away or taking a shower, I say to myself something to the effect of ""I want to do this"".

1.I don't feel anything when close people to me die(even my father),  I kinda feel guilt for not feeling anything,  but not really. 

2.I understand nothing about laws and stuff. I mean personally I see nothing wrong with  beating people,  raping girls,  selling drugs and so on. Like I can imagine me doing same if I wouldn't get punished for that. 

3.i have done terrible things in my life,  and I have no guilt.  It's like somebody else have done that,  but not me. 

4.i don't care if people around me feel bad and stuff,  I don't understand these feelings(or if they get sick/laws problems etc etc etc I'm usually happy,  since it's something interesting in my life) . However I really like when people around me happy and I have great empathy on this one
