0,"Going through a rut again. Been in a college town for 7 years, and know nothing besides this place for a while now. Moved to this country in 2009.  Feel so disconnected from every friend I have made. Feel like I am so removed from high school friends, it was 7 years ago I moved to this town. And now every friend I made here is leaving this town for better opportunities.  Made some really good friends. Pretty much older brothers. Them leaving hits really hard. They have been family the ladt three years. Tough pill to swallow.",25May2019,1
1,"I’m honestly struggling to find the worth to living. If I live I have to deal with haunting memories of the past. If I kill myself maybe I’m just lazy or selfish. I wake up in the mornings struggling to find something to get me out of bed because I just feel nothing, emptiness, it’s like I almost feel at peace with the thought of death. But I’m also simultaneously petrified of death. I really don’t know anymore I keep going back and forth and I just can’t seem to decide what to do anymore; what’s going to be the most logical decision for everyone.",25May2019,5

3,"I’m doing so much better. I was in a bad rut for a long time. I thought I was okay but I wasn’t. I wasn’t hurting myself or having suicidal thought but I still wasn’t doing good. I’m weaning off of Geodon and being slowly moving onto Abilify. Geodon was a miracle drug for in the beginning 5 years ago, but it just wasn’t working anymore.

4,"Not sure if this exactly makes me an extrovert since I don’t even necessarily enjoy the company of others, just kinda need it. 
So when I’m around people, I’m frantic, impulsive, slightly hysterical, kinda crazy, (I don’t often think before I speak) and happy. I always have dark thoughts looming about, but when I’m with people- in person not online- they lose their importance. They have no effect on me.
However, when I’m alone for about 15 minutes, I’ll begin a downward spiral. I’ve self harmed, and sat doing nothing for hours- being so saddened that I don’t even have the energy to cry. 
Does anyone else have this problem? People see me as a dumb, ditzy, happy, innocent, optimistic person. I’m the last kid anyone would ever expect to be like this. In a way that kinda hurts. Is there a name for people like me?",25May2019,1
5,"I just don’t know where else to post this. I’ve been dealing with depression for 1.5 years now. I dropped out uni around this time of last year. Came home, living with my parents. Never ever had a job, I’m nearly 21. Have anxiety problems and I’m also extremely socially anxious. My boyfriend left me three months ago and that just absolutely destroyed me. I’m not happy around my friends. I want to be part of a social circle I just can’t really be part of... I’m scared of everything, scared of the future. I dob’t know how I will handle life by myself. I’m so exhausted of all these stressful thoughts I have. I have chaos in my head. I’m so vulnerable right now and also emotionally unstable. I distort the objective reality to the fullest, I do this with time as well. I met like 7 different therapists. They also prescribed me some antidepressants but I refused to take them because I’m pretty sure this will make my situation only worse. I hate myself, I am lost and I feel like I have no identity at all. I don’t who I am and nothing makes sense. Always compare myself to others, which makes things like 10 times worse. I feel isolated like and everybody seem so distant. So scared I cry a lot and live with anxiety and really soul-crushing thoughts. I also have suicidal thoughts. I can’t bother my mother with this right now and the rest of the family truly doesn’t give a fuck. I am so confused, so tired of it all. Please, somebody say something, suggest something or just talk to me. I would really appreciate this right now.",25May2019,3
6,"About a year ago I tried to end my life. It was an overdose, but other specifics are not needed. 

I wish I could sit here and say, I’m happy it didn’t work, because some days, that isn’t true at all. What I can say is, when you feel completely alone, and like people don’t care, you’re more than likely wrong.

I was going through a bad downward spiral, I had a lot going on in my life. My biggest problem was I felt like no one would genuinely listen to me. I wasn’t in therapy at the time, and unfortunately friends can’t be therapists. I felt like any time I was upset or complained, people never took me seriously. They tried to “one up” me, or I was consistently met with, “just be positive, things will get better.” Unfortunately, these empty words were just that, empty. They had absolutely no meaning to them and did nothing to comfort me. 

I will say, after my attempt, and getting back out, I was met with such awfulness. People don’t like what they can’t understand. Almost no one could look me in the eye and just treat me like a human being. This of course made everything even worse, and all I had wished was my attempt had worked. I was handled with care, but too much care. People didn’t want me around. I was a problem, not a person. I also, of course, never have felt worse than I did when I saw the strongest people around me crumble and break down because of what I did. 

While things with the people in my life have gotten better, I can’t say my circumstances have. I can say that I have even more shit going on my life than ever before. I am happy I’m here to face things, I am back in therapy, and I am trying. Some days are just harder than others. I’m not writing this to say, oh don’t do it things get better, because I’m not sure they do. I am writing to say, things happen for a reason. I try to believe I have a bigger purpose and there’s a reason I’m still here. When that doesn’t work on my darkest days, I remind myself of how I was treated after. 

I understand feeling completely alone, detached, and defeated. I’m a hypocrite if I say to not ever try what I tried. However, I will urge you to reach out and get help when you  feel so low. You don’t know if you’ll be the reason someone else plans to live for even just one more day. A smile to a passing stranger can make all of the difference. I have had several conversations with people I don’t know well afterwards, and I know that I lifted their spirits and helped them feel better, even for just a day. If I wasn’t here, who else would have? 

If you read this, I thank you. It’s not something I can really talk about with people in my life because the topic is so taboo. I just want you to know, that there is always someone’s life you can change for the better. If you’re struggling, I’m happy you’re still here for now, even if you can only do one day at a time.",25May2019,5
7,"I have a bad history in school that's been related to mental health, which has meant that I've been in and out of school to the point where I've been behind in a lot of subjects, and right now I'm not in school at all. However, I've been working with a private tutor for the last six months and I'm almost at the same level in maths as the rest of my year, and I've actually started my English Language and English Literature GCSE studies earlier than everybody else because I have a better grasp of the subject than other people my age. 
 
I recently turned 14, so this is around the age that you choose your GCSE subjects and I'd actually like to take 8-9 of them, but my mum is set on the idea that I should stick to 5-6. I want to work in science (astronomy or medical studies) and to become a qualified doctor, I have to take at least 3 sciences, and do them well. She doesn't think I'm capable of taking 3 science GCSEs.

Basically, I'm taking Music GCSE and the standard English and Maths GCSEs at the moment, but I'd also like to take:

Biology
Physics
Astronomy
Psychology (to potentially specialise in mental health nursing)
German

I'm currently signing up for an open university course in German which, when completed, would be the equivalent of a German A-level and would mean that I could cut one or two modules off of a degree if I chose to pursue one. 

But my mum thinks I should just take one science at the most, so I only take 5 GCSEs and since she has full control over what I study, I'm really upset. Whenever I talk to her about it she brings up my school history so despite the fact that I'm ahead of my year in English and almost caught up in Maths (sped through 3 years' worth of maths in 6 months) she thinks that my school history will get in the way of my GCSE results. I just want to cry.

I'm sure she thinks that I still have the same work ethic as I did when I was eight as she constantly mentions that I'm 'not booky enough' or that I'm 'not an academic person' and it's SO frustrating because there's nothing I can do or say to sway her. I've told her that I literally willingly study science and mathematics online for fun and that if I'm not working I feel completely depressed and she's still not convinced that I have what it takes to do *8* GCSEs. EIGHT. The maximum you can take is 10 and the average is 7, yet she thinks I should only take 5? 

I have NO control here. I'm so upset because I can't fucking change my past and I'm not the same person, I'm proving that! I haven't got severe social anxiety anymore for fuck's sake, I'm going on a 6 day sailing trip with 10 people I've never met before in my life tomorrow and I'm really outgoing when we're in public. The only reason school didn't work for me was because I had social anxiety and now I don't anymore and she thinks I can't take my GCSEs how I want to because of work ethic?

I sound like such a stuck up bitch in this post because I'm lucky to be taking any GCSEs at all, but it feels so fucking unfair that I can't choose what I want to do because of how I acted when I was eight years old. I'm so tied to my history and I wish it would stop. I just want my academic legacy to go away. I want to be successful and pursue what I love without the constant backdrop of the fact that I've had shitty mental health issues for most of my life which meant I was behind in school for most of my childhood. I'm so tired of my social anxiety and depression being brought into every conversation with a teacher my mum meets. I'm so done with my fucking 'tendencies'. I'm not the same. I wish she knew that. I'm so fucking over it.",25May2019,1

16,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong page to post this and if this is a bit long.. But I don't really have anyone to talk to right now so I'm just going to vent. 

So there was 2 things that happened. And I can't really cope with it anymore. 
Hopefully the backstory helps people understand the situation.. idk I haven't done this before.

1st - when I was 17 I was raped at a friends party. I won't go into detail because I don't want to trigger myself or anyone else. But it destroyed me. 
I turned to drugs and drinking to numb the pain and distract myself but that led to me losing my family. 

I guess the penny dropped because I moved to a new country on my own at 18 and had a fresh start and became sober. 
I was still a wreck, but I had hope that I could turn my life into something better. 

2cnd - just before I turned 19, I met a guy. I thought he was the love of my life and things got serious quickly.  He convinced me he was the only one who could protect me. I moved in. 
He was not a nice guy, mostly emotional abuse but on occasions he would also physically and sexually abuse me, even though he knew about my previous assault.  Purposely triggering me by grabbing my throat from behind and saying things like it was my fault and I deserved it.
I got cut off from everyone I knew, friends work colleagues. I couldn't even call my mother to attempt at rebuilding our relationship. 
I finally, after 10 months of hell living with him, got the courage to leave. 
This was followed by weeks of threats. That he would hurt me, that he'd find me, I was scared for my life. 

Then he went quiet
 Until I started receiving texts saying he was going to kill himself and it was my fault and that his blood was on my hands. He quit his job, moved out of apartment. At first I tried to find him, to stop him doing this and was trying to contact everyone to see if they knew where he was or if they could help.
I was receiving messages from his Facebook account from (as I was under the impression at the time) his father. He was ""worried about **** and hadn't heard from him in weeks"" even went as far as saying he'd found a suicide note. 

My friends who was letting me sleep on their sofa was suspicious of this as he knew ****'s character so investigated. 

We found his real dad, who had no idea of the events and advised us that **** was actually at the pub with his friends. 2 months had passed by this point. 

For 2 months I thought I'd killed him, that I was responsible for his death. 
Even though it wasn't true, and I should be fine.... I'm not, it's like the guilt I felt and the damage I done to myself during that time can't  be undone. For 68 days straight I bullied myself. Convinced myself I am a toxic vile person and shut myself off from everything and everyone completely. 


Now that the shitty back story's over, flash forward to now. 
I can't sleep, an hour a night if I'm lucky. When I do I have the same nightmare. I'm trapped in his bedroom with him and my rapist. 

I can't eat, I haven't eaten in 36 hours and I'm still not hungry.  I have to force myself to eat one meal a day (by meal I mean half a pack of instant noodles) and 50% of the time I can't even keep them down and just hurl them straight away. 

I'm in trouble at work because of absences and sick days. Even when im there I can't focus and barely cover my minimum targets for the day. 

I keep terrifying flashbacks or getting triggered by something as small as making eye contact with the cashier when buying groceries. When I don't have this bursts of fear and anxiety I just feel numb and empty. 

I despise myself, I had a break down and smashed all of my mirrors and reflective objects, including my phone. 

I can't cope. I don't know how to change this. It feels as though there's only one option to efficiently stop this constant hell I'm stuck in. 
I'm trying not to do that, but it's getting harder as each day goes by and I don't think I can live like this much longer. 

Does anyone else get it this intense? Am I alone with how I feel? Has anyone else over come this? Advice? Comfort? Help?

Later in the date I felt kind of light headed all starting after I kissed my boyfriend.
I was lucid but I kept sort of spacing out or blacking out.

Eventually i ended up 'slobbing the knob' as he calls it, and really I feel like I was in shock. I kept losing concentration I was shaking, and blanking out.

22,"So I am making a pitch to the school board in my district. I am currently a post-secondary student who experienced anxiety/depression all throughout my high school years, and I see it becoming something that is starting to affect more and more youth. Enough is enough, and as a passion project I am drafting an idea to solve it. Please give me advice on your opinions of it.

It goes as follows ; integrate post-secondary students into helping overcome mental health issues. I researched in my area, and there are mental health certificates that anyone can take that makes them capable to help others dealing with mental health. I believe that many university students would be passionate and want to help deal with mental health, as movements such as Bell Let's Talk demonstrates that many people recognize it being an issue.

I am proposing that university students can help in a two-fold manner; the first, have university students who dealt with mental illness come to high schools and talk about how they overcame it. Second, develop an app where university students can interact, keep in touch, and help make high-schoolers feel at ease about the future or general worries that they have.

As I am drafting out this idea alone, I would really, really, appreciate any sort of insight or opinions on this, as its something I would love to see passed. No one deserves to go through these things, and prevention and support is key to lowering the accelerating levels of issues regarding mental health that we see today.

I have been blessed with a good family and friends, and I wish to extend my love for the world out and help others. I want to change things, and opinions on my idea would really, really help.Thank you :)",25May2019,1
23,"F(29) I feel like I have been struggling for most of my life and some things have gotten better (jealously, stalking tendencies, too much of a sex drive? but like not really wanting it but doing it anyway...) other things are getting worse (my dark thoughts, impulsivity/recklessness with money and decisions in general, obsessions, overthinking, often overwhelmed with my surroundings, mood swings etc.), my husband doesn't believe in mental illness so according to him I'm sensitive but fine.

25,"I don’t mean like big chunks of my memory or what year it is; like last night I had started a pot of boiling water and set a timer for 5 minutes and when to another room. Timer on my phone goes off and I count it as something annoying and don’t move. 15 minutes later I go back to the kitchen and see the stove is on and I remember that I started to boil the water for something. It happens when I manage to make food for myself or open the fridge and somehow I get distracted and forget to close the fridge or the freezer door, or remember to grab my drink from the counter. It’s really weird and kinda scary.

Another thing is, I lose things a lot. And then I find them after I had looked all over (which is hard because I have to use a cane to move around at times) and the thing I lost was right in front of my face. It’s making me feel like I’m going crazy. When I say it was right in front of my face, I mean, it was right there in the first place I looked and didn’t see it.

27,"For most of my life, I was very confident and outgoing. I was naturally ambitious, highly competitive, and full of energy. Giving presentations, reading my essays for my class, performing for people, etc. were things I looked forward to. I loved being in the spotlight, and totally undervalued that trait while I still had it. 

Now, I’m a junior in hs, and I feel like I lost my spark. I constantly feel inferior. Reading/presenting for class and talking to most people makes me anxious, and I come off as weird because I stutter and speak in a monotone voice. Once taking pride in my work, especially my English essays, now I mentally blow every assignment so out of proportion that I can’t bring myself to do it. I used to be a straight A’s, maybe one or two B’s sort of student, and back then I thought they were awful grades. My final GPA after this year will likely drop under a 3.0 due to multiple C’s, D’s, and even E’s in my semester grades. 

I either don’t do my projects or don’t turn them in. It’s hard to explain, but it’s like I have no confidence in my ability to put effort into things.  I know that logically that doesn’t make sense, but it’s the only way I can’t think of to describe it. I still feel the same desire to achieve, but constantly self-sabotage. I guess over the past few years all the failures have made me depressed and ashamed, which makes me fail more, which makes me more depressed and more ashamed... you can probably see how it spirals downward. 

I have ADD, but up until last year I didn’t have any issues with school at all. I got A’s and high B’s without even trying. It seems like there has to be something more beneath all of this, but I can’t figure out what’s wrong with me. The worst part is knowing there’s no true reason I should be struggling. Everyone sees me as an incredibly lazy waste of potential. Teachers and even my family act disgusted by my lack of effort; they don’t understand how how much I really care because all of my actions contradict. I can’t even blame them; from an outside perspective I appear to put no thought or effort into anything, when in reality I’m constantly stressing and agonizing over it. It makes no sense. I’m very lost and as the reality of my grades sinks in, I’m horrified, ashamed, and just don’t know who I am anymore.

The parents told us his name and we screamed it at the top of our lungs for close to 15 minutes looking for him. Finally we get traffic from command saying that the child was found and we have CPR in progress. The medic and I raced to the scene. All the engine guy scurried around to assist and we took over resuscitation. The mom was down on her hands and knees screaming at her son too wake up, but there was no anvil. An office grabbed a pediatric backboard for us and we threw him on it and carried him to the ambulance. There we 5 of us in the back of that small ass rig, 2 of us rotated CPR while 1 tried to intimate and 2 set up the monitor and started an IO. He wreaked of literal human shit, come to find out he was found floating in the septic tank. The monitor read asystole so we pushed 2 rounds of Epi with no luck, and we had no luck on intubation. It was just bagging and CPR the whole ride to the ER. We arrived and got off with him, as we took him through the ER it was dead silent with the whole ER staff in a daze looking at us, we were all beat to hell working this kid. We past him off the the ER Doc and the still worked him and tried more rounds of Epi. The mom walked in and saw what happened, I immediately ran to her and gave her the biggest hug I had ever given. She said “thank you, is he going to pull through?” with tears in her eyes. I told her I don’t know but we did everything possible on the way here. She squeezed me tight and softly cried as I hugged her again. I walked out to see one of the engine guys squatting on the ground crying and 2 others holding their head in their hands. The medic threw me a water and told me let’s get back in service. I went home the very next day and cried, tears of pain for the family. I cried thinking how panicked and scared that kid was when he drowned, how heart broken that mom was in the ER. I had been shook by that day ever since. To this day I still think about it, children scare the fuck out of me. The other day my girlfriend’s 2 year old nephew opened up the plastic cover of their septic tank and looked down it, I literally tackled the kid screaming in his face.

31,"So I was trying to explain to another person about my mental state and was accused of just having it because ""mental illness is popular"". Fast forward through a conversation, it got me thinking about romanticizing mental illness as a fad in media and elsewhere.

If you could recommend a work/article/novel/show etc. that misrepresents or glorifies having a mental illness and briefly describe (summary + illness represent + what it gets wrong).

34,"i struggle with severe anxiety that i’ve had since i could remember, (that fluctuates from time to time) and depression (more recently within the past 3 years). 


i’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year. we love each other very much, have pretty much zero arguments, and in my opinion, are a very great couple. however, i have multiple mental health struggles, and he doesn’t fully get it. he’s had anxiety, but not nearly to the extent of mine. and he’s generally a positive, happy guy. sometimes i feel like my world is collapsing and i get into these depressive episodes, that i feel rub off on him. causing him to be sad, and this hurts me. i love him, and i don’t want my baggage and problems to affect him. yet, he’s sort of the only person i can turn too, so when i’m sad, or anxious, i feel the need to talk to him about it sometimes. he always tries to make me feel better but i can tell when i’m upset, it puts him in a bad mood. therefore i try to keep my problems to myself, but he can still see right through me, and knows somethings off. and of course, he wants me to feel like i can talk to him about anything. maybe i’m overthinking all of this, but i really worry that my issues will eventually cause problems down the road in our relationship.",25May2019,1

The group seemed to be disrespecting Ricky for no damn reason (he’s was like 15 yrs older than us) (and Ricky and the other guy are black so you know how far disrespect can go). We leave and nothing happened but Ricky seemed really pissed off. This is where shit gets weird for me. While we’re leaving I start getting shit mad and VERY paranoid at the other black guy who was messing with Ricky. We’re sitting to go on another ride and the other guy gets in line practically behind us with his friends. By this point my teeth are grinding so hard you can hear the squeak.

She doesn’t have any specific experience with any of my issues, which include depression, anxiety, probable bipolar and PTSD from an abusive childhood. But she’ll see me, which is more than I’ve been able to get.

She has been understanding and empathetic, but when she does speak in our sessions she basically repeats back what I’ve said in an “empathetic” way. I have a very negative self-image which comes out in my speech all the time. I know in therapy we have to work hard to change, but these negative thoughts are so thoroughly baked into my self-image that I don’t even view myself as speaking negatively, I view it as the truth. But she never points out or challenges any of the awful
things I say about myself. 

In our sessions I have called myself a total failure, an awful person, a burden on the planet, an ugly deformed troll, an unlovable bitch, just to name a few. She doesn’t even acknowledge when I say stuff like this, just sits there mute
as I entertain myself by thinking more mean names to call myself. Maybe I’m expecting too much, but I kind of thought a therapist was supposed to challenge these negative self-perceptions to help us reframe them, or whatever. 

When she sits there passively listening to whatever nasty things I believe about myself, it seems like a tacit agreement that all of these awful things I think about myself are indeed true.

I know I'm not clinically depressed, I can motivate myself to do stuff, I can feel positive feelings, and I eat and sleep pretty well, and I'm not in danger of suicide or anything and I don't get panic attacks.

I still get the urge to do it on bad days, but I am able to stop myself. I get anxious easily especially in social situations, I'm very obsessed with maintaining my image and whenever I ""fuck up"" I always feel like I'm an embarrassment and worry excessively that I'll be watched and disliked. 

My parents always tell me that I'm too negative and critical of myself. I'm a minor, so I'll need their permission if I were to see a professional. I know my dad is supportive because he takes antidepressants (I didn't mention my thoughts of self-harming), but my mother said ""it's not a big deal"" and basically said ""You can change your attitude if you simply commit to it, you don't need a psychiatrist"". They never brought up this conversation again even though I gathered up a lot of effort to talk to them.

46,"I had the whole night just to myself. My whole family was out at my older brother’s rugby game and they decided last minute to stay in the city for the night. The house was mine and no one could stop me or change my mind on what I planned to do.

I hyped myself up for a few hours before my mum even told me that they weren’t coming back and when she did, I gave myself a couple more hours to really think things through. 

I raided the medicine cabinet for my little sisters Ritalin pills and lay them out on my bed. I grabbed my razors from my bathroom and placed them next to the pills. I jotted down a few personal things on a piece of paper and put that on the bed too.

Everything was set. I was going to swallow as many pills as I could, get into bed and make one final cut along my wrists and let myself finally rest. 

I was almost certain that I would do it because of the hours of hyping myself up and telling myself that this was the best time and the best idea for me. It was almost exciting to be so close to feeling free of my pain. I was laughing and crying at the same time, it was so weird. 

When the time finally came and I was staring at the small bottle of pills, I looked at my sisters name and thought all about how selfish I was to use her medication. I knew that she needed them to get through the day because I’d seen how hard it was for her when she didn’t take her meds. I decided to put them back and just use the blades. 

It scared me a lot to be so close but I was also so ready and so needy that it outweighed my fear of dying. I got in bed with one of the longer blades of mine and started bawling. I cried for like a whole other hour before my body shut down and I fell asleep. 

This morning I woke up to my family’s normal loud banging and laughing and I was so shook and upset that I’d fallen asleep. The note and blades were still on the edge of my bed and the blade I’d fallen asleep with was right beside where I was sleeping.",25May2019,2

This is a throwaway 

My sister is in her thirties and suffers from ADHD...but she’s becoming increasingly delusional and paranoid 

She’s been through a MASSIVE amount of stress over the last year - losing her business and she’s basically broke 

We believe she’s suffering from nicotine withdrawal (can’t afford ciggies anymore) plus she is convinced everyone is in cahoots with bringing about the failure of her business (they weren’t - she drove it into the ground).

There’s a massive amount of pride involved but she has big anxiety attacks and is becoming thoroughly convinced people have it in for her 

She’s on Ritalin and my wife asks her regularly if she takes her meds - which she says she does - but we not convinced she does so regularly.

We just want to know how to get her help - help that will actually be regular and good for her and the best way to take steps to get her to help herself 

My wife and I are thouroughly convinced she really needs professional help

51,"*Weebs of this sub-Reddit****, I call you to arms...*** *also anyone else*

Now that I have your attention, I'm new to this sub-Reddit and literately just found it so if something similar has been posted in the past let me know, also you won't find any suicidal tendencies or disorders here (at least that I'm aware of), finally if your not in the mood to read a visual novel then skip this post (its ok, I won't judge).

Alright, into the depths of my inner thought we go. This all started about a day ago when I discovered a new uhh... ""NSFW"" game called ""Strive for Power"", a Management/RPG style game that I decided to give a try despite my lack of prior interest in management games (for context on ""Management"" think HunieCam Studio). The game has an interesting plot with decent world building as the MC is a mage trying to gain power with the ""assistance"" of slaves that the player is able to train, trade, and care for. The game does a better job of selling it, but it is seriously fun and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys RPGs with elements from other genres. The game does a good job of making you (or at least me) care for every one of the people that you decide to make your servant (mostly girls as the game is pre-set to be that way). And I think that is were the problem of mine lies as even though you have to devote important time and resources to each servant while also maintaining a good relationship with them a certain mechanic in the game prevents you from treating them *too* well. They'll eventually begin demanding better living conditions and while you are able to provide those conditions, in a limited amount; that can be increased, at the beginning of the game its near impossible to keep up with. I know this sounds like I'm just ranting about a game, and in some way I am, but while frustratingly attempting to make all my girls happy, while also working them just enough to earn a profit to eventually upgrade our living conditions I realized something. I had been saying to my-self ""you can do better than this, try harder, they need you"", and to them (the girls) ""why demand something you know I can not give, I've given you a better life than what you did before, I'm trying my best please just give me time"".

I just read through what I've typed and it put knots in my stomach. Anyway, now we're on the same page, mentality wise at least. I know that these girls aren't real, I know that the interactions between the MC and the girls is all scripted and I know that no sane person in the real world acts like the MC or the girls in the game, or any anime/game for that matter. And yet, I still feel a deep urge, a will, to protect, grow and learn with them. I fantasize about waking up in a house with girls that genuinely care about me and vice versa. This isn't the first time I've felt like this, at first I just brushed it off as a stupid kink brought up from watching to much Harem anime or something, I've even acknowledged that nearly everyone of my own relationships in the past have been with girls that haven't exactly had the best up-bringing. But I believe now that it wasn't about the idea of having a bus load of girls to fondle, it was just about that affection that they brought with them, like in harem anime there is no sex or depravity, just a guy that knows that he is surrounded by girls that genuinely care for him; at least that's what I tell myself

Back to those past relationships, after everyone, every last little insignificant one, I only blamed myself, I always thought that I could have done better, I could have been more proactive in her life, I should have seen this or that sign, what ever is was it was my fault. That being the reason I began pushing people away romantically, I was tired of being hurt, and it wasn't till recently after another failed attempt at being happy that I was going though the process of self-hatred and pity when a friend revealed to me that that wasn't healthy. Since then I've been trying to convince myself that I actually might *not* be eternally lonely. At the same time however I still have an irrational romantic attraction to girls that have a ""tragic backstory"" or unruly home life.

At this point I feel like I'm writing a thesis, so I want to ask, do I have a twisted idea of love? Is it even an idea of love? Have I given the right info? Is this just an overblown fetish, kink, thing that I've exaggerated over the worry that it might cost me my ability to find love and be happy, or am I even asking the right questions?",25May2019,0
53,"I woke up, and instead of wallowing in the bed, I got up drank a glass of cool water and went in front of a mirror. I decided that I would from now on every morning go in front of a mirror and tell myself 3 things I like about myself.

I thought to try to talk to a therapist but after tries of getting back “sorry no more patients” or “we don’t take your insurance “ or just no response back I am not actively pursuing that anymore. That’s an obvious cycle of rejection leading to giving up and.

He has also began to behave violently he  has spent as long as an hour smashing things in his room (chairs,the closet door a computer key board a fan etc.). These smashing things episodes have occurred 1-2 times per month for the past 4 months. They happen with no warning or particler he is also in a deep dark mood and never comes out of his room when he is at home. He has dropped all his hobbies and his grades which were once straight As are now Cs plus two Fs. He is currently taking summer school and will probably not graduate this year. The worst incident was a month ago when he kept punching the wall until he broke his hand. He told afterwards that the only way make himself feel better is to destroy things and that he will eventually kill himself because our mother abused him as a child and he believes that he suffers from irreversible trauma as a result of it. I should mention that my mother was emotionally and physically abusive two both of us as children. Specifically she would scream at us, lock us in our rooms, spank us with kitchen spoons, and shove bars of soap in our mouths when we talked back. She does not view any of that as abuse she viewed as diciplin. I should mention that my mother is an extremely conservative evangelical Christian who home schooled both of us until highschool.

61,"She [29f] broke the news to me [30f] 2 days ago. As someone who lives with me, I feel:

- angry that someone as lovely as her has to go through the pain of chemo. She's been healthy all her life and this is really the last thing I've expected.
- really fucking guilty. Symptoms started appearing about 2 months ago. Oddly enough, I remember her messaging me one day to say that she felt dizzy at work and tripped over, causing the sprain her ankle, and if I could grab an ice pack for her swelling. Her sprain had swelled up to half the size of a tennis ball - I joked that she must have been working on a ski slope because that was too much for someone who collapsed working in an office. She'd been revising for work-related exams for the last 2 months and had progressively lost alot of weight - I thought it was stress (it wasn't). Shes been coughing for the last month or so - incessantly throughout the night and I didn't do much to check in and find out if she was okay. I am an awful friend.
- heartbroken that there is a possibility she will not be with us after chemo. She's been so positive and I pretend to be, for her sake. It breaks my heart to see her wheezing now and surpressing her cough while I'm speaking / engaging with her. Really just alot of 'what the fuck' s and 'why'. Trying to focus on the 'hows' to try to stay grounded but it's really difficult. 

I do think that alot of what I'm feeling goes deeper than the here and now. I lost my mother to lymphoma when I was 5. Many people don't realise that I have so many memories of this (I've often met people who've actually said 'you were too young to remember'.) I don't refute this because I don't want to admit that I do to them - I don't want to talk about it really. The past incident with my friend has really brought up more feelings than I've cared to address in the past. 

I think a good way to overcome my overwhelming feelings right now is to think about how I can help her (she's moved in with family now who live much closer to a hospital). Other than that, I really don't know how else to deal with the sadness. I dont know when it's going to go away.

62,"At this moment I’m dealing with an episode of obsessive thinking. The topic ranges but I am so exhausted just thinking thinking thinking about the same things over and over and over again. If I’m not thinking I feel depressed anxious or uncomfortable. I make Lists in my mind, repeat solutions, a lot of planning is involved, constant justification and self reassurance over and over again. It’s not the bog standard “I’m a failure” “I’m useless” it’s more mechanisms to try and reassure myself it’s okay, it’s got to the point where I don’t really know what I’m thinking and why I’m thinking it’s all chaotic, but I’m going round in circles and I can’t do anything but think, as soon as I try and distract myself the thinking calls and I feel too depressed n low energy to engage in activities that I would like. I do suffer from (undiagnosed) ocd, but I’m not quite sure what’s going on here, I have latched onto a range of different topics and sometimes the obsessive episodes can latch onto random things that I don’t care about but I have to “recite and discuss”in my head. A minor episode would be like having to break down lots of words and meanings while reading a book or anything. But this episode is really hard because it’s relevant to something in my life and I’m scared and I don’t know what it means and I feel guilty and anxious and it’s so so so trivial and weird from the outside but to me it’s all consuming.  I want to feel that it’s okay and at least know what’s going on but no amount of reassurance works.  The obsession is involved with alcohol and sobriety and the balance, it’s convincing me I have a drink problem. I don’t but I have an emotional dependency on alcohol even if I don’t drink regularly or often. anyway that doesn’t matter. Any advice???",25May2019,1

When we are okay, I feel like I am so happy and everything is so good.



When we argue or he does something that disturbs me, I feel really distant from his emotionally and start to think about our relationship if it is good enough or not. It doesn't have to be a big issue at all.



Also when we argue, it affects my daily life too much. Basically if we are not okay, I am sad for that time period.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a boyfriend and we've both come to the conclusion together he has Borderline Personality Disorder, he exhibits all the symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

It's come to the point where I can't do anything, go anywhere without him suspecting me of cheating etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do things with my friends, I want to go see my friend now she's moved to Birmingham, I want to go on nights out, I want to go to a festival, I want to be able to SHAVE. I can't do any of these things he won't let me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know none of this is healthy so this isn't what I am needing advice on.

I plan on telling him that if things won't change I will have to end the relationship. I am just unsure of how to approach this, I don't want him getting violent/suicidal etc, I want him to see his behaviour isn't ok and that if he was able to make some changes we can be together.

&amp;#x200B;

I just need help on what to say? How to approach it, how to handle his objections etc?

68,"I know very well nobody will be able to give me a definite answer and no one can. I just would like to have opinions from people who have relatives with this condition. 

My mom was diagnosed with Dysthymia (PDD, Persistent Depressive Disorder) 3 years ago. 



She very little leaves the house, sleeps or rests on the bed 16h a day. She does take medications but I honestly have some reservations about it being only Dysthymia. But again a family can only bring facts, not diagnosis. 


The facts here are that my mom has never been really present, really ""smart"" (she doesn't understand simple things. Example: how to open a can with a can opener, no matter how many times it has been showed to her. Its not her memory, she just can't manage to do the same thing and understand the process behind it). 

Sometimes she wouldn't get reasons of reactions, she wants things done only in her way and she has some obsessions. And I am pretty sure she has never told them her psychiatrist. 


-She constantly watches bad news on TV. Almost compulsory. She reads books about horrible things happening to people. Especially, well, men raping women. 


-I don't even know how to present this, but: even when I was 8-9 and I would say something like ""the members of my team have decided to etc."" , she would say: ""Don't say this. You know what a member is? Is the... lower part of a man. Don't use that word."" 
And so on with any possible word with double meaning. I've never imagined the double meaning before she told me, actually. 


-She used to go through my stuff when I was younger to find if I had weird things hidden in my room. 


-When my first boyfriend and I would take a walk in the park, she would everytime pretend she would take a bike stroll and pass exactly by the park (she never did that before and I was 16). 
-She wouldn't let me go to a male friend's house, with other kids, cause she feared it would become an orgy (when I was 10 and we always lived in the most peaceful countryside). 



These obsessions have always been there. The point is, nobody can tell when she really started to have this disorder and how much it influenced her very personality.



I am just wondering now, what has been her and what has been her condition. It breaks my heart that she was not lucky as others... and suffers because of this. I just somehow would like to believe it wasn't and isn't her, but something in her brain causing this. 


What should I believe? What was your experience with a PDD relative? Is there anything that should be done? Should the psychiatrist know about these obsessessive behaviours? Can something be made to help her? If it isn't her nature...
Can something be done about this constant tiredness? 


Thank you in advance.",25May2019,4

71,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I know the thoughts below might be incoherent. But you gotta understand that when somebody vomits their toxins out, its not in the same order the food went in. It's always chaos but it needs to be thrown out of the body. I apologize if it becomes too hard for you to follow what comes below:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 24 year old guy who has done nothing in his life. I am fat (been fat going up and down for the past 10 years), unmotivated, have no interest in doing anything at all in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I have never had any good friendships. I am good at talking to people. I just don't have many good friendships. I see people having support systems, other people they can lean on. I feel that only for my family. I was always the infamous child at school. Everybody hated/ignored me for no reason whatsoever ( i used to ask them repeatedly - they just won't answer. They'd rather not play a game as opposed to having me in the mix to play with ). I still feel that those times made me the person i am today. I entered university with an attitude of having the ability to talk to anybody. I could. It was kind of a fresh start. But there were other hurdles that stopped me from forging deep friendships. I was a day scholar - wasn't interested in the field I was pursuing engineering in. 

&amp;#x200B;

During my high school, I didn't clear entrance to an exam and hence didn't get a reputed college. I went to the next best university but my parents didn't let me choose my field of interest. I went through 4 years of engineering in a field I barely liked. I always wanted to work in computer science (which now i feel was not the full picture I had in my mind back then). Post university, I joined a software company where I still work. Its been 2 years Y months here for me. And i had a quarter life crisis a few months back. I realized I have become complacent. Everybody is moving towards their dreams, their aspirations, trying to move towards their futures. I, on the other hand, have been doing nothing but enjoying the fruits of labor (not even challenging) acquired from a job which is okay-ish from a growth perspective and doesn't pay too handsomely. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still fat, still feel shitty, still have no concrete interests and most importantly - I compare myself with people all the time. I have also accepted that I might be lazy but that is in such opposition to my everyday hyperactivity. I get too enthusiastic, work diligently if i take something up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have talked to people. They have been suggesting me to go for management studies (most of my closest relatives and family friends have faith that i would flourish because i am a natural leader and have creative skills). Some have put forth the idea of going for a Masters degree in computer science because of my inherent interest in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Truth be told, I really don't know what I am interested in and I admit this for the very first time in my life that I am a proud person. Sometimes starting from scratch just feels like too low for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever i ask myself - ""What do you want?"" - The only answer I arrive at is ""Money, Power, Fame"". Then I think about acting and other associated fields to entertainment. 

&amp;#x200B;

My love life isn't going any further either. I have always believed that I might be a unlovable because I don't look good. But the truth is - I actually feel I am unlovable because I feel she'd get bored with me whoever she is. I only have had one girlfriend and she betrayed my trust. It wasn't that long of a relationship. But it was serious and I was all in. This might be the reason I have this innate desire to woo every woman I find because I feel incompetent on not being able to keep her. ( lately I have realized she was a bad person - it had nothing to do with me )

&amp;#x200B;

The sole reasons I go for fitness or even think about going to a gym are due to the appearance features it will help with which in turn would help me ""score"". My motivations are ""looking good"" over ""being fit"" and I feel I have dragged myself long enough to try and change it. I constantly indulge in self-pleasure which I immediately hate after cleaning myself up. But it numbs me down to all the pain I keep feeling. I want to stop it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have this negative tendency that makes movies have a large effect on me. Lately, I have felt closer to movies that portray the hard life of a character (whether be it career, love or in general). I connect and often have observed myself trying to imitate behaviors that are not entirely of my own thought.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I went home binged watch a bunch of stuff - ate and overate. Was up all night on random chats and kik messenger. Was making comments and memes on Reddit. Slept at 6 am. Woke up around 4 PM. Felt shit and would like not to repeat any of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to change my life. I have tried meditation, life courses (suggested by my well-wishers) and what not. I just don't seem to get out of this rut. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have this fear that I won't be liked enough, won't be famous enough, won't have lived enough, won't have loved enough when I am on my deathbed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to summarize - I am a mid 20s guy without a direction or interest in life. Had my quarter life crisis quite early. Feels lonely because I feel I have no good friends. I have a tendency to keep comparing myself with others who were there with me at some point in their lives (school mates, my brother, college mates). I still feel shitty almost all the time.

72,"Thank you to anyone who might spend their time reading this. 20 years old, male. I have had OCD since about age 12. Mostly mild obsessions having to do with superstitions and a few compulsions. However that all changed after I finished high school (age 18). I think around that time I developed an unhealthy ego, (thinking I am better than most people) and in turn my OCD undertook a really nasty hypochondrial transformation. I started worrying a lot about losing my intelligence. First I was afraid of diseases like meningitis and things of that sort but eventually that evolved into a fear of chemicals. I would spend more than four hours a day searching online about toxic chemicals that could impact intellect. Washed my hands compulsively, threw out clothes that I dropped on the floor, took two showers a day, left work if a drop of roof water fell on my head during lunch to take a shower and then come back, hid my car keys in a bush next to my parked car instead of my pocket for fear of the brass in the key which contains trace amounts of lead. Could not touch pvc cords due to the trace amounts of lead. etc. This lasted for about a year before I managed to get over it through self-conducted exposure therapy. Around the time that my fear of chemicals started to disappear I developed what I consider my worst OCD I have had in my life. I have played rugby and American football throughout my childhood, ages 8-18. I received 4 official concussions, countless times where my bell was rung. I played running back in football and 8man in rugby (arguably the two worst positions in each sport for head trauma). And basically to keep things short, my day to day life for the past year or so has been ridiculously obsessive. There are good days and bad days but it is not unusual for me to stay in bed all day with the thoughts that I am completely doomed due to the brain damage I have received. I have read thousands of articles, cross-examined countless studies of concussions and football, went through a phase where I was very paranoid about hitting my head to the point where I couldn’t ride in a car because I am afraid of the bumps. I could write on and on about the ridiculous thoughts that occupy my day. Since 18 I have managed fairly well to lower my unhealthy ego to the point where I realize I am probably less intelligent than most people, but that has not affected my OCD. Can somebody please help me.",25May2019,1

74," 21 year old male, I've had a odd child hood but nothing too insane, dad was in jail most of my younger years, bounced from house to house until the age of 12, constantly seen my father abuse my mother and step mom, graduated in the top 10 of my class with quite a good amount of populaity, and spent a super short stint in the army directly after high school. Not an amazing life but nowhere near awful, but I've always wondered something about myself, I've always loved to see people being humiliated and tortured. Even as a young kid I can remember wanting to torture a kid around my age purily because I wasn't fond of the boy. I often imagine killing people who have done me wrong and I even still hold spite towards those who've done me wrong years back. I still fantasize about torturing them. Though the thoughts always come the impulse to act has never really been felt, nor do they give me sexual gratification, though some do, I am more thrilled with the thought of getting back on the person I have spite for. I have an almost uncontrollable temper when angered and I have issues controlling my moods. All the thoughts and issues have seemingly starting to increase rapidly since about a year ago.

Normally I do stuff like watch you tube videos I don't actually enjoy because I'm afraid of watching something else, weird fear I know, but up until a year ago I thought that there might be a slight chance people can maybe read minds, so I got in the habit of trying to think in a cool way and I can't really break it now. This morning was weird though, because I thought I was confident, at least compared to how I used to be (not even being able to sit by a window and literally running to my room when my siblings would walk into the house) but I realize I'm really not.

Yet, these personality disorders are strictly described as separate in every available source.

79,"I haven't gotten much sleep this week and last night was the first time I could sleep for as long as I wanted. Having nothing to do all day, I just lay in bed and let my thoughts run wild.

Traffic accidents, assaults and kidnapping scenarios are the most common ones. I don't know why I do that but I recently learned it's quite common with people who suffer from different mental illnesses, and to some extent with everyone else, too.

81,"Ok so basically what's going on is that I have really bad panic attacks and my physician prescribed me an SSRI to help manage my anxiety. This isn't the first time a Dr has tried to give me SSRI's for this. I, however, react really badly to them. They make me feel out of control and manic like. They also make my anxiety way worse so I haven't taken it but a few times. I told my physician and she gave me a mood stabilizer to go with it. It didn't help so again I stopped taking them both. She set up an appointment for me to go see a psychiatrist because she believes im bipolar because of how the SSRI's make me feel. Now for the drug abuse part..

Ever since high school I have been interested in different drugs. During my senior year I started to take Benadryl and cough syrup (not together) since they were easy to get down at the store. I started smoking cannabis after I graduated. I honestly still smoke it and also smoke CBD hemp to help manage my anxiety, insomnia, and lack of appetite. But going back to after high school..

I experimented with shrooms and other psychedelics and they were cool but made me in a bad place afterwards so I didn't really do them much. I tried Xanax, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and Dilaudid and never got addicted to them, just took them every now and then. Well one day I got sent to the hospital because one of my friends was worried about me killing myself. I use to freak out on people when they didn't wanna spend time with me because I felt they didn't like me or something. Im not sure. From middle school until about 3 years after high school I would do this. I felt like no one wanted to be around me so I would make sure they didn't I guess? Im not sure. 

But anyways, when that happened, the cops found some weed and I got charged with it and was on probation for a bit so I couldn't smoke. I started smoking k2 (spice) in place. At first it was nice. It felt just like weed and I enjoyed it. Eventually it took over my life. I lost my job and ended up staying at home all day doing nothing but smoking k2. 

Eventually I stopped smoking it and the withdrawals were the worst thing I've ever felt in my life. It messed with me physically and emotionally and mentally. I feel like it's one of the main causes for any mental illnesses or other problems I now have. 

But after getting off k2 and being able to smoke weed again I was back to somewhat normal me. I still had no job and honestly wasn't looking for one even though I needed to support myself. 

One day one of my ""friends"" asked if I wanted to try meth. I had tried cocaine a couple times and it wasn't anything special to me. I was more into downers. But I smoked some out of a pipe and it made me feel.. normal? It completely destroyed my social and general anxiety and gave me ambition to get up and find a job and do something with my life. 

I found a job, stopped smoking meth to pass a drug test and started again. Life was great (other than what I was spending on meth). Eventually the price got to be too much and I stopped using it. Since then I have only smoked weed and CBD hemp. No other drugs (other than Kratom and kava). 

My question is though, if I tell my psychiatrist all this, will she still be apt to give me a benzo for my panic attacks? They get really bad to the point I almost pass out. I pace back and forth and feel like screaming. The pain in my stomach and chest is horrendous. I don't know what else to do except try to get something to help.

I'm a 16-year-old girl. I can't deal with this anymore. I just need to vent.  
my whole life people/ parents have had these high expectations from me. I need to be the head girl of my school, I need to excel at studies, at sports, at extracurricular. and I'm never enough. I'm never the best at anything I try, and it makes me feel like a disappointment. after everything I've been through, 6 A\*s isn't even enough for them.  
my school life is pretty shit, social life nonexistent and it isn't roses and ponies at home either. my parents keep fighting all the time.  
my dad has big ego issues, never thinks he is wrong in anything and is always victimizing himself.  
my mum has a lot of patience, but both of them suffer from anger management issues. their marriage has been very abusive. hitting, shouting, taking everything personally.  
the fights are sometimes small and they make up for our (the children's) sake.  but mostly big and violent. with a lot of shouting. my mom always ends up crying and it pains my heart to see them like this.   
we have been estranged from my dad's side of the family because of other reasons I won't get into, but I can't erase the image of my delusional, alcoholic uncle beating himself up.   
my dad had an amazing career, but somehow he lost all that and is now not able to get a job. my mom supports the family but he cannot come to terms with that. we are feeding off of scraps. they are barely able to put together any money for my schooling. i don't know if i will be able to afford a good college, i don't want to grow up and live like this, always worrying about money. i see all my friends going out places and i can't join them because i don't have that luxury. my parents have not bought new clothes for themselves for a couple of years. sometimes i really think it would be easier for everyone if i wasn't there anymore.   
sometimes i hear echoes of screams in my head and panic that they're fighting again, but they aren't in reality. i see flashbacks of the violent scenes and it unsettles me  
I follow all these superstitions, like always sleeping on my right no matter what, seeing no footwear has been overturned, etc to keep peace at home. but my faith from god has just about lifted. if he loved all his children, why would he make us suffer so?  
there is so much more that I'm not in a state to write about. i know i suffer from self-image issues, anxiety attacks, depression. and i also know that people are going through so much more and worse, and for a long time i believed that my issues don't matter, but im sharing this now to doubtfully any one who cares because i know i need help.

It feels like I won't be able to improve from here, because no matter what I feel like I'm doing right it apparently wasn't good enough to keep me around. I don't really have anyone to talk to that could give me solid advice or comfort me properly. I feel so lost and I feel like bashing my head against a wall every single day.

96,"I've met people over the last few years who actually pretend to have depression and anxiety. They show the stereotypical and very untrue ""symptom"" of virious mental illnesses while I'm sat over here thinking ""are you serious right now?""


Sitting in a group of your friends and being all sulky while also explaining how emo you are does NOT make you depressed. At least as far as I know it doesn't.

As far as I know, people with depression don't want to tell anyone and everyone about it. They don't want to tell someone they met barely 24 hours ago that they apparently cut themselves either in the past or present. (yes, that actually happened to me, believe it or not, i wish it wasn't true, but yes, it happened) 

I understand that people will reach out on places such as this reddit forum because they're looking for help or just want to vent about things. But when people IRL openly tell people about their mental health problems to people who might as well be complete strangers or not so close friends, that's when I find it just incredibly wrong.

For God's sake! Only a few months ago in my college English class, a guy approached the desk that myself and two other girls were sat at and just said something along the lines of ""I got diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder"" to which, to my complete shock, he followed that up with ""how the hell does that work? Depression and bipolar disorder aren't even to do with each other! How the hell do I have both!?"" and he did it in such an unbelievably causal manner! 

I was shocked, of course someone can have both disorders. Bipolar disorder can lead to depression and (as far as I know) visversa.

Of course I can't say he absolutely did not have depression, I'm not a therapist, but the way he conducted himself and how he, I guess, flaunted this mental illness, it made me sick and needless to say, I hated his guts ever since.

(A little back story...I came out to my super conservative and religious family a couple of months ago. Needless to say it did not go well at all. Admitting this to them was single handedly the scariest moment of my life. They blew up on me...my dad said he wanted to kill him self because of the news of me being gay and he then threatened to call the police to have me removed. My mom was in the same boat with my dad. They never attempted to apologize for their actions. I felt so alone during this whole experience because I craved acceptance from the most valuable people in my life.) cut to two days ago...I woke up from a nightmare in panic because I was dreaming my mom and dad were up in my face screaming at me.  That was it...I had enough of carrying this burden. So yesterday I asked my mom for an apology for how her and my dad had treated me. She denied that either her or my dad had done anything wrong and their actions were justified. She said I had made up the comments they had said (is this gaslighting?) Upon asking for this apology my dad also walked into the room. He gave a very half assed (sorry for language)  apology denying  he had done anything wrong. I had it with them. I exploded and told them how I really felt about them. I spoke the truth and said that I utterly resented them for their actions. I resented then for Calling me abnormal and unnatural. I resented my dad for telling me “he didn’t raise me to be gay”. By me expressing my feelings they exploded as well. My dad yelled at me saying that being gay was the equivalent to being a child molester. This comment sent me over the edge. They went on to say even more hurtful things. And I will fully admit that I said very mean things back...I was trying the best way I know how to defend myself. My dad proceeded to kick in our wooden kitchen island. Large chunks of wood left laying on the floor. After all this is said and done. My parents thought it would be a great idea for me to have a crisis mental evaluation at an emergency room. They took me in and I went back. This process was long and drawn out...the doctor said I was a normal kid. The doctor also said he wanted to apologize to me for having to deal with such ignorant people. My parents paid $500 to be told that their son is a normal person. Also side note my mother took me to an emergency room a county away so they wouldn’t be embarrassed of me going in. Cut to this morning and my mom and dad try to start another fight with me. I felt and am staying at an apartment an hour away from them. Does anyone have any advice for me? An I being emotionally abused? Any comments are greatly appreciated.",25May2019,3

106,"I need to be able to help someone and I don't know where to turn.

She reaches out to me when she's panicky and tells me she feels alone and that I'm not doing anything to help but I really am trying and I just don't know what to do.

I'm a very logical type person so my tendancy is to put a plan into place and work towards that, feeling anxious, well lets do something fun, need some time to unwind I'll be here with you and we'll have no responsibilities we'll just relax. Nothing I do seems to work and I've breached the idea of seeking a mental health professional but she iterates that she wants the help to come from me not someone else.

I've been hesitant to seek outside help because one she states how she wants it to come from me and two it never seems that bad, she's definitely not on the extreme end and the level of disorder (calories consumed/work out levels) aren't getting worse but it seems to be getting worse in how she's feeling and I think it's because she feels so alone in this. I try to join her and try to shift the mood or just be there for her to talk to/vent to but nothing seems to be helping.

109,"Hi, i'm a 19 year old women, 5'4, 120 pounds, Canada. For the past 4 months, i've been having very very bad anxiety due to the fact that I can't remember certain things. I would say 90% of these things are very silly. for exemple: anxiety over forgetting to who I recommended a certain show. I've kinda been diagnosed with OCD when I was 12. I say kinda because I didn't actually physically went to the doctors because I wasn't comfortable to opening up to someone. instead, my mom called a doctor and explained, in a very in depth call, what I was going through (will explain shortly). the doctor proceeded to diagnose me with OCD and prescribed my zoloft. I have now been taking zoloft for 6 years.

To explain what led to my OCD diagnosis when I was 12: I had very obsessing thoughts about my sexual orientation. to the point that it was all I was thinking about everyday, all the times. The obsession became so bad to the point that I became depressed. My OCD thoughts were telling me that i'm gay but my real self knew that I was 100% heterosexual. I just couldn't get the thought out of my head. I recall having OCD since I was a little girl. For exemple: when I was maybe 6 years old, I had obsession over the fact that my mom is going to die or that I wanted her to die (even thought I didn't but my OCD thought were putting ideas in my head that I didn't actually believe in. another exemple is that I had thoughts about what if god doesn't exist? (even though i did believe that he does exist) and the thoughts were persistant and the more i tried to fight them, the more they became stronger. when I was 12 and I explained to my mom what was happening to me (OCD about sexual orientation), she helped me a lot and the zoloft that I started taking (100 mg) helped me a lot.

Fast forward to now, I've been in a relationship with my current boyfriend for 5 months. but ever since I started this relationship, my OCD reappeared again. I think about him and the relationship all the time. that's when the anxiety of forgetting things appeared. When for exemple I leave after hanging out, the next day I get flashes about conversations we've had and I can't remember everything 100%. For exemple, I don't remember if I said a certain thing when we were parked in front of my house or still on the road. or another exemple : did I say this certain things when I was doing that or was that with someone else/ doing something else. Or: was he the one that texted me that one thing (and I would go back in my texts, sometimes months and months back just to get an answer to my question). Forgetting things like that are making me go crazy because even though I know it's normal to forget things, I can't seem to accept it. it's not just things regarding my bf (but mostly because I care the most about him), but things that can happen at work or with friends. for exemple: I forgot if I showed my friend (A) my new shirt or if that was my friend (B) or I forgot if it was person A,B or C that told me they liked their coffee a certain way. When I try to remember, my anxiety starts growing and when I can't remember, I continue obsessing over it until I can't take it anymore and my heart start pounding very fast. this is interfering with my every day life activity such as work because if I get a random thought at work that I can't try to find the answer to, I won't be able to concentrate. I went to my doctor's not too long ago (2 months ago) when this started happening and he increased my zoloft dosage to 150 mg. I don't feel that this increase in the dosage helped me. in fact, i'm getting worst every day.",25May2019,2
110,"Throw away account for obvious reasons, but I would love some help in understanding what I am feeling. For background I served in the military, upon coming home I was diagnosed with PTSD.

Do it."" and my heart races and I have to move away from her to stop that urge. I would never. I love her dearly. She has helped me so much. I feel so much shame for these urges.

116,"Last week I graduated from college, and I'm feeling really regretful of the way I finished my college career. I have a learning disability and worked hard throughout college to improve and study better and harder, but I feel like I gave up my last semester and can't stop regretting it. Last semester I got all A's and felt a great sense of growth and achievement, this semester I got tired and began to resent some of the courses I was in, and let this get in the way of my own success, rather than pushing through and acknowledging that everyone has to do things they resent. I made choices like sleeping for 6-7 hours instead of staying up to finish assignments, hurrying through assignments, missing classes to catch up on other work, and prioritizing a job instead of academics even though my boss encouraged me to put school first. I missed the cutoff for an A- instead of a B+ by one percent, and in another class I did really poorly on a final because I didn't study for it properly, and didn't put in enough work throughout the semester either, so my final grade dropped from an A- to a B. It's not that I didn't study, but he changed the format from the first three tests to the final, and my study methods were ineffective for the types of questions asked, resulting in a D on the exam. I wanted to improve my grades before applying to graduate school and I totally lost sight of that, so my gpa stayed the same. Everyone else in my family is going through something really difficult- my dad lost his job, my mom was diagnosed with a cognitive impairment, and my sister got a DUI- but all I had to do was be a normal student and I couldn't even accomplish that. Everyone keeps telling me they are proud of me when they shouldn't be proud of me at all. Part of me wants to blame burnout, but I feel like I was given every opportunity to succeed and I chose not to. I know there are people who have messed up worse, but I come from such a loving family who has supported me to no end, so I had no excuse to have done badly. I was wondering if anyone else has had the same experience, and how the moved on from the shame and self-loathing.

I constantly feel like I’m being shamed for having a mental illness.

That it’s wrong of us to make others suffer when we’re having a depressive episode. My therapist has even said he doesn’t think I’m trying hard enough to get better so it’s my fault for not improving. I don’t know. I just feel like there are so many people who still don’t take mental illness seriously.

118,"I'm not an addict or an alcoholic per se, but I find myself regularly drinking once or twice a week (and every few times accidentally end up getting borderline blackout) and smoking weed probably every other day and I want to cut back but I just find life to be so painfully dull that I don't know what else to do. First off I will admit that I am severely depressed and absolutely use drugs and alcohol as a method of self medicating but I don't want to want to do it as often as I do. I regret drinking every time I do it the next morning (sometimes for acting stupid, but also just because I find that it gives me an overwhelming sense of regret even if I barely drank and went home early) and I often regret getting high within a few minutes of smoking because of the anxiety it gives me, but they also function as an escape from the bland world I'm stuck living in and honestly the sensation of being intoxicated is still much better than my ""default"" mode. How can I learn to find more enjoyment in the world around me without altering my state of mind with drugs? I don't feel addicted in that I would have no problem giving it up if no one around me was offering it to me and I wasn't regularly put in positions where drinking/smoking is encouraged, and while I've cut back a lot recently I want to be able to resist the temptation entirely rather than just doing it in smaller amounts and less frequently.

I guess my reasoning for not wanting to have a close friendship is because when we once did have that, the things they put me through effected my mental health badly and I've worked so hard to get back my peace of mind.",25May2019,2
126,"I've been sitting on the edge of my bed, staring into space, nearly tearing my gotdamned hair out for about an hour. Half-baked ideas materialize and disappear at lightning speeds. I need to *do* something. I wish I could just show up at work and work a shift, but I'm not scheduled until Wednesday. 

I can't pick something. I *know* I don't have the follow-through for a task like writing a book or selling everything I don't need. I want to chug a bottle of cough syrup and sleep overnight in the forest, but that is *not* going to happen. I need something that starts and ends. I feel hopeless. Desperate. Fragmented. Confused. Damp. Ambitious. I want to open a cafe.

Oscillating between muted terror and productive excitement. Confidence. My brain is too scrambled at the moment to write fiction anyway, but I wish I could. Where can I go? What should I do to pass time? Why do I want to just kill time when this time, this life, is all I have? What am I even waiting for, for which this period of passing time will eventually end? 

I don't think this feeling will last for too long, but I'd been depressed for so long that I'm excited to have my energy back and I don't know what to do with it. I can't relax. What do you guys suggest I do???",25May2019,15
127,"I read the rules but I'm unsure if this type of post is allowed, if so, mods feel free to delete if you can point me in the right direction.


Anyway, my estranged family's mental health and lifestyle are...unhealthy...unsafe. all of us kids needed up with our own little worlds of problems, but my kid brother has what I would say the worst. 

Recently my kid brother who had been doing okay since being kicked out and getting on medication. But it all collapsed today, as he's been cheeking/hiding his meds, for a while, and had to be revived after downing the entire prescription. 


He is safe and in a in-patient mental health facility, but that is short term, and people working with him have reached out so we can find a long term solution to help him....and unfortunately due to his level of self care and self harm, it needs to be residential. 


Anyone have any helpful thoughts or tips?",25May2019,1
128,"So around 3 weeks ago I found myself in a situation where my fiancé and the time walked in from work after no problems at home or anything at all and told me ‘i can’t do this anymore’ at this exact point I was sat playing on my PlayStation which I do every so often as a stress relief method. At this point my life flashed before me almost. It was as if I had heard the comment but immediately couldn’t believe it. 

My fiancé is a fantastic woman and is 4 years older than me and is turning 30 this year, we have a mortgage free house and lovely luxury car on the drive and both have good jobs whilst high pressure good. I hate my job with a passion and have done since I was 16 however she loves hers. We live in a 4 bed detached house and have never had a problem with having what we want.The house is mortgage free and was handed down to my fiancé after a traumatic loss in her life which has allowed her and indirectly myself to have a very fortunate start in life however the house never ever come close to who she lost and we both would swap it In a heart beat. I met her after this was very fresh and recent and over the last 7 years we have had a wonderful relationship, occasional arguments but overall it’s been amazing. 

We don’t spend out of our means and we don’t have the best everything but we are very comfortable. I met her when I was 18 and very young, obviously she was early twenties and dropped out of university to care for her immediate family member. Overall the last 7 years of our relationship have been amazing and the majority of it I would not replace for the world. Neither of us are big drinkers, we don’t smoke and have no ‘bad’ habits at all. However the last year or possibly two it has gone down hill due to my irrational behaviour, mentally I have never been shown love growing up, overall I had a very privileged upbringing compared to most however there’s a lot of things I didn’t have growing up that my friends did like we rarely went on holiday, we very very very rarely went out for dinner as a family in fact if ever at all and things more family related. My parents were away a lot through the later years of my teens at weekends etc and I did a lot alone. I didn’t have many friends at school and I feel partly that was down to my arrogant behaviour and the fact I was a lot more mature than 90% of the other people at school. I feel I have always been second best to my younger sister and worked so hard to buy anything I wanted (computers, gaming consoles, phones etc) now please don’t see it that I have been hard done to because it isn’t true but I’m trying to build a picture. 

A lot of this has put me into a situation where I feel I have emotionally abused my fiancé without meaning to and without any reason. I can come home from work and just have had a bad day and it will end up with me snapping at her, now I never was physically abusive or aggressive or anything that would  put her in harms way, I would NEVER hurt her physically because I am not that type of person. But I have without even realising not been able to give or show love and it’s ended up putting a wedge between us and hurt her emotionally, without knowing I have beaten her down and beaten her down to the point she has had to get out of the situation by ending it because she doesn’t believe I love her because ‘if I did I wouldn’t do this.’ Now I believe I have got better but from the start it was not given really. Over a year ago a similar problem occurred and I was advised by a very close family friend to seek help. I thought nothing of it and ‘brushed it under the carpet’ metaphorically as My parents would say, ‘it will be alright’ type of get on with it attitude. It’s since then got worse and it’s spiralled out of control, I can’t physically show love even though I love her to bits, it’s the same with my few friends and my parents, I find saying I love you to my parents uncomfortable and I rarely get physical emotion from them as in hugs etc and have never really had it. I’ve now had a mental breakdown and am in an appalling state, I can’t function, I’ve had to take time off work and I feel split in half. I’m lonely, depressed, anxious and it’s all hit me in one go like a massive brick wall. I feel I’ve gone from no emotion to overwhelming emotion that’s been unlocked due to this breakdown. 

It’s as if all of this build up over the last 20 years has finally come to the tipping point and it’s taken my fiancé who tells me she is in love with me and cares about me more than anything to split up with me due to how I treat her. No I will absolutely add that 8 out of 10 times I am an absolute star to her, I tell her she’s beautiful and I love her and kiss her every day, I do a lot in the house including the cleaning and gardening but them 2 times out of the 10 she won’t forget and forgets the good times she sees it as very negative and I feel it has turned that way so that she doesn’t see positive. Now I have had several counselling sessions and have had a lot of reflections time I feel both my fiancé and I require counselling both individually and as a couple but as we are now separated I’m not sure if that’s ever going to happen. The situation is very unique and I doubt there is much out there like it but I just can’t help but feel all of it is my fault and it’s been caused from experiences that are nothing to do with her and yet it has ruined us. I have now reached out to a therapist and he is helping but it doesn’t feel quick enough. It’s been 3 weeks and I genuinely feel no better at all and if anything worse. I’m sure I have missed a lot of detail out which is important but I could go on for pages. The only thing that I feel is relevant is that she has not asked me to empty the house or given me the ring back or made an attempt to sort anything that’s mutual out. She hasn’t even asked me to take all my clothes and I find that a sign of hope, it maybe false but hope all the same. 

I’m heartbroken because we had talked about children and our futures together and we both agreed that we didn’t see it any other way even when she told me she couldn’t do it anymore due to my behaviour that had never been in doubt. 

Is there any advice to sooth my heartache of loosing the girl of my dreams and then my anxiety and depression that I believe has stemmed from my childhood? I’m lost in a bad place and I feel no exit to it all.",25May2019,3
130,"Know what? I'm too nice. I don't know how to not be nice. It's a curse. I have a hard time calling people out or saying things that may hurt their feelings. I take things very personally and assume everyone else does too? I don't know how not to?

Because of this I'm an easy target. In the last year 4 people have taken advantage of me and lied to me, blaming me for an outcome I had nothing to do with. I'm at my wit's end. Being a female when I do try to assert myself I feel like people think I'm being a bitch. 

Right now I'm hurting and spending my day in bed because I feel like I just keep taking the punches. I'm down and feeling hopeless. 

I want to move away and start over but its not an easy option right now.",25May2019,4
131,"Every so often I'll get this urge to be super productive and that will last for a couple weeks. Then I'll start getting frustrated and disappointed with something derailing the productive mindset. Then I get tired and lazy and start having a negative mindset, then that leads to the beginning where I feel super productive again. It's a cycle that I cldont understand why it's happening. I suspect it's the frustration and disappointment phase that is the real problem and probably where some deep rooted issues emerge.",25May2019,1
132,"Hello all! I'd like to introduce [my new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/). As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population. I'm hoping it can be a sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy. Thanks for reading if you got this far 🙂",25May2019,1

I feel like I have PTSD, know I have severe social anxiety, feel like I have undiagnosed ADHD, and I’ve always suppressed my thoughts and feelings. I never thought or considered myself in depression, or even anxious. I always just did things, sort of. Never really thought about it, until recently when I had a crazy freak out panic attack a few weekends ago, absolutely railed a dab pen for so long, like an idiot. I’ve had an extremely stressful childhood. Not to make this a sob story, but I can really never formulate my thoughts, it seems like? 
I’m high right now so that might be killing some of my anxiety but I just want someones insight?TL;DR: I feel like i’ve never really known myself as a person, up until I had an extremely traumatic event recently, and starting wondering.",25May2019,1
136,"hey Friends. ive been struggling a long time with maintaining relationships and just day to day life. I have major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder. Sometimes i get so wrapped up in my fears, and anxiety everything  just feels really intense that i cant focus on anything else. The worst is probably the fear of abandonment . What becomes a fear becomes a self fulfilling prophecy someway somehow and its always devistating in the long run. 
         Ive been seeing this guy for a few months. Despite everything going well i was unable to continue meeting up with him as i thought he was going to leave me eventually. In the end i just decided i wasnt good enough for him and that was that . I stopped talking to him it just caused me too much pain for so long that i couldnt focus on anything else.  
I thought of him everyday and i still want to be with him i just dont know how id go about talking to him again i dont think there is an excuse for what ive done mental illness or not. It becomes difficult for me to control my emotions once they became that strong.  What are your thoughts? How does one maintain healthy relationships with bpd?",25May2019,2
137,"I moved back to my home state for college after high school. I was born and raised here until my mom moved me to the Midwest when I was 11 after she got married. That man turned out to be abusive and they got a divorce. I finished out high school in the Midwest, but I didn’t want to be there anymore. Now my mom and I both live in my home state, because my grandfather died in the fall. My grades sank, my mental health plummeted, I became basically a shell of who I used to be and lost my college friends because of it. My mom moved down here and she still has some of her best friends here. 

Well I don’t know anyone, my childhood friends are my friends on Facebook and all of that but I haven’t spoken to them in years. In a whole year of college I never had any romantic prospects, and the only girl I ended up still friends with lives 4 hours away and also has a boyfriend so she never has time. 

My mom is always hanging out with her best friend. I don’t understand how she doesn’t see how lonely and depressed I am. I’m either at work or laying in bed, I barely speak to my family. Instead of asking me if I want to go do something on the weekends she goes and hangs out with her friends. Honestly it really hurts me but I don’t know what to do. 

I just turned 19 and everyone I work with is well into their twenties. They’re always making plans right in front of me but never invite me. I get it, who wants to hang out with a kid, but it just reminds me that I can’t even make friends at work. I feel hopeless anymore. I’m transferring to a smaller school, if I couldn’t make friends at a university of 50,000+ how am I going to do it now?

I had these big plans that I was going to live my best life after high school (I was raped, found out I had a congenital bone disease) but it seems like somehow everything is worse. And it seems like it will never get better, which is a scary thought. I had such big dreams and now I don’t even care about anything anymore.",25May2019,2
