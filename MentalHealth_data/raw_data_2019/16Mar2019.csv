0,"**Background**: I've \[23F\] been diagnosed with a swill of mental illnesses throughout the years, all starting when I was about 11. I had a traumatic experience that was followed by years of bullying. In the beginning it was depression and bipolar. I also developed a drug problem when I was younger but I haven't done heavy drugs in years. Now, it's become anxiety, ADHD, and depression. I've been on Adderall 20 mg/ day for about a year now and was just recently prescribed Prozac 10 mg for 5 days then increased to 20 mg/ day along with Hydroxyzine (an antihistamine to reduce anxiety before bed) 25 mg when needed. Recently, I've also been trying to get a hold of my alcoholism because it's been getting worse. I didn't drink for about 2-3 weeks which was amazing, but then I started back on the routine I had of coming home from school instead of staying to study so I could drink and browse the internet like a bum. 

**Monday**: It's the beginning of spring break and I was feeling like having friends over, so my fiance and myself had 3 friends stop by. Ironically, 2 of these people are former alcoholics and don't drink any more and the other just isn't that much of a drinker. I proceed to drink heavily every day from Monday to Wednesday all while I continued to take my meds and I think I couldn't sleep for a day or two. The beginning of this week is very fuzzy. I know I'm an idiot for drinking and taking these meds as I've been warned not to do so. I'm just a selfish, alcoholic, hedonistic brat at times. But, it's already happened and I can't do anything about the past, I just need to make sure I don't ever do this again.

**Flash forward to Thursday morning**: I made plans to relax with a friend since I knew I couldn't continue down this path. I tried to get some sleep so I took a quick vape of cannabis. This is where everything starts to get really bad. I lay down and start to feel this prickly, tingling feeling in my face and head accompanied by my vision going completely white and fuzzy. I have felt this only once before and it was when I was coming down from a heavy dose of LSD years ago. It's literally the worst feeling I've ever felt. It's like I'm dying all while it's taking too long to happen. I got all twitchy and shaking, sweaty and hot then chilled and freezing. There's this overwhelming feeling of restlessness. I need to get up and move around but then when I do I need to automatically lay back down. I'm nauseous and hungry but can't eat anything and strangely enough now I need to use the bathroom and I'm ridiculously thirsty. I kept wanting to go to the hospital but I didn't want to bother anyone if it ends up not being a big deal. I just accepted death at a certain point but it just sucked so much since it kept going away and coming back ALL DAY AND NIGHT. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue what this was. Just a panic attack or serotonin toxicity? All day today I've been anxious, crying, hopeless, and just wanting to die so this never happens again. I feel like I've been bothering my fiance with this outburst and I know he's been trying to help me with eliminating the drinking. He's very helpful and loving I just feel like I'm stressing him out and going to lose him. And I also don't really have a lot of friends. I'm very scared and lost and rambling right now. Thanks for letting me vent. Any help or assistance is appreciated. I'm in NJ, US.

1,"I'm not sure when exactly, but around 2016 I've started to pick up violent actions. Around that time, I was probobly considered a wild child. I would make many episodes of yelling stupid shit and whatnot. I went to the next grade, doing the same retarded shit I would. I had a group of freinds that would do stuff like I would, so I guess that gave me a lot more courage to continue these acts. When I was getting ready to go to the next grade and already was, I started to wonder why I was so crazy. I thinj this is when I picked up cutting. I would look back at it and hope everyone else wouldn't remember. My freinds still act a bit wild, but not as much as we used to. I probably have antisocial disorder or/and bipolar disorder. I picked up a shady attitude with many people, but to the point where I had audacity to punch peole in the face when they do small things to me, such as break my pencils. I even sometimes imagine stabbing people, killing myself, running away, ect. In the right group and conditions, I can be a upbeat and happy person. I don't want to be like this anymore. I want ro stay as a happy person. Things like this are affecting my learning and whatnot. Especially math. I suck at math. I want to go to a very good school, but they only accept specific grades. I don't want to disappoint my family by failing. Are there any tips you guys have?",16Mar2019,2
2,"Today I was working in my station assembling some parts. I had the World War Z audiobook playing on my laptop. She overheard it and asked me if I was talking to myself. I told her I wasnt. She then said that if I was she wasn't sure if she should call the cops or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think she was joking but it just made me realize that people will call the cops on you if they suspect you are doing something semi off. If someone is talking to themselves they will call the cops. I assume they think the person will recieve medical assistance in jail which is not the case. Well not immediately but calling the cops seems to be a dangerous step.

Am I wrong in thinking that?",16Mar2019,43
3,"(Throwaway account)
So, a little backstory, when I was 14-16, i was going down a rabbit hole of right-wing radicalisation, i watched people like Alex Jones, Tommy Robinson, Richard spencer, etc. 
And supported organizations like the EDL and the proud boys.
it got to the point when I was on the verge of almost committing crimes, but I had a miraculous reality check and realized that I was digging myself into a deeper hole of hatred, after a few talks with my parents and other things, I distanced myself as much as posible from everything right-wing and I saved myself from posibly becoming a right-wing terrorist like Brenton Tarrant.

Im 20 now and since those days I've been mostly fine, I'm more of a centrist now, but...I unfortunately still have some of my past views stuck in my sub-conscious and I don't want anything to do with them anymore, I feel torn apart sometimes, I don't want these views but I still have them in my head.
What can I do to rid myself of them? Will therapy help? I'm concerned because I fear i could slip back into my teenage alt-right mindset again and I don't want that to happen at any cost.
Thanks ",16Mar2019,1
4,"Just for context, I am from the US and 15 years old female. I don’t know what to do about any of the problems I am facing, and I would really like to have some kind of information about what I can do or what this is. 

For the past 10-11 months, I’ve felt completely apathetic towards almost everything, and very disconnected from who I think I used to be. When I reflect or try to describe myself, I see nothing there. I feel like I can’t see what I used to be either, I honest to god have no idea who I am or was, except for my name. My name is really the only thing I know about myself. I also can’t recognize myself in a mirror anymore either. I feel as if my whole body doesn’t belong to me, and whenever I move I don’t feel like I am in this body. 

I am very disconnected from myself, and I really just feel nothing but apathetic about everything, it all feels grey. I don’t know what this is, or what I’ve been experiencing for the longest time. If anyone could shed some light on this, it would be very much appreciated. ",16Mar2019,1

7,"Looking for advice for my 15 year old male cousin. Sorry this is long. Recently he has been having night terrors where he will wake up from bad dreams and cries or sobs. When asked about what he dreams about, he closes up, says he doesn’t remember, or that he does not want to talk about it. Our family is highly concerned for him for a number of reasons. He is a very private, closed off person. He was diagnosed with social anxiety in the past from a child psychologist. A few years ago he began going to counseling because our family was noticing medicine missing from our medicine cabinets and some of it was found hidden in his room. He was taking the medicine trying to make himself feel better, but instead he usually felt sick and lethargic. He is not on any medications. Since then, he has stopped seeing a counselor. However, there are some more stresses or factors that could be weighing on him. His mother has not been in contact with him at all for the past year and a half. His dad has not told him why his mother has been gone, perhaps worsening his worries and fears. He does not ask or talk about his mom but I know it bothers him that she is gone. Additionally, recently we have noticed his scabbed or bloody knuckles from punching trees outside. Perhaps self harming? Our family has also had concerns in the past that he may have an eating disorder because he is so skinny and visits the bathroom for long periods after every meal. He is always tired and quiet. He likes to stay in his room alone, even for family get togethers. We want to help him as it seems the night terrors are a serious sign of concern. I am looking for any ideas, resources, or personal experiences that could help my family in addressing our concerns meanwhile supporting my cousin. ",16Mar2019,2

9,"To start off this post I've have had issues with anxiety in the past, but more minor and was getting good control over it (it's borederline non-existent in my day to day life now). But a few months ago I lost my brother in a car accident and ever since my anxiety has been amped up to an 11, as well as frequent panic attacks that I've barely experienced before. I should also mention I've been on a new medication (Vyvanse) for the last 5 months while these panic attacks started around 3 months ago, but I'm convinced it's the cause to this peak in anxiety and I'm wanting to taper off of it, also a frequent smoker but I'm quitting that too because fuck smoking honestly.

It seems to flare up when I smoke a bit of weed. During the day I'll feel fine, but I'll sometimes smoke a bowl in the evening or night to relax while burning through my workload (I know it doesn't help that it's usually sativa) But lately whenever I smoke weed I feel this intense pressure in the back of my head that starts in the back of my neck, as it feels stiff. I get heart palpitations and chest pains/tightness and it feels like pins and needles are shooting up my neck and into my head and all over my body. It used to feel like I was on the verge of a heart attack, but after getting those symptoms under control it feels more like I'm on the verge of a stroke. The other night it was so bad my left arm felt like it was weakening or numbing, but I could still move it. There was no drooping in my face or arms when I raised them. One side of my head will feel heavier than the other and like it's clogged or stuffed, the pressure will sometimes be behind my eye(s) but more dull, accompanied by clicking and small cracking in my neck and head (which feels like it relieves some tension after) It feels like my head is on the verge of exploding from the pressure as my nose becomes stuffed and breathing feels easier on one side of my throat, if that makes sense. Sometimes it feels like there's popping in my head.

I've been smoking weed for years and have greened out numerous times before but they never constituted a panic attack, let alone to this extent. Drinking water and deep breathing while stretching my back/neck usually helps resolve these issues but I can't stop thinking about it. Deep down I know I'm not having a heart attack or stroke but it just feels like I'm on the verge of something happening. It's like the panic overrides my rationalization but idk if it's my body emitting warning signs. I just had a check up and they said my blood pressure was fine and my heart was healthy, but I just can't shake that feeling there's some underlying issue.

I've gotten better and calming myself down but these symptoms are so persistent. Do the symptoms sound like the possibility of an underlying issue or am I just freaking myself out and further inducing it? Would really appreciate some advice.

13,"I just had a panick attack. I was reading up on them (science helps me) and all say that they can last up to 30 minutes normally reaching the peak at 10. This is silly to feel like, but it feels like mine only last a few minutes. I'm not sure weather there was a build up I just don't notice or a cool down I don't see as the panick attack, but generally my attacks, the part of shortness of breath, dizziness and intense fear etc, only last maybe 2 to 5 minutes. It makes me feel like Freud for not having people long ones like others and feel guilty. Does anyone understand what I mean or also have short panick attacks?",16Mar2019,1
14,"I'm not sure if anyone else has struggled with this. 

For years I have viewed visiting a psychologist, therapist, mental health professional...etc as a silver bullet to solving my mental issues, but I always kept putting it off (something about telling a stranger my personal problems scared me, especially when considering the high price). I knew deep down I desperately needed therapy to change my mindset on life and to control my anxiety + depression.

I've been struggling a lot recently (especially with anxiety and depression) and its starting to change who I am and it's impacting my life a lot. 

So I finally decided to book a session. I picked one of the top rated therapists in the area (who has written a book and has an endless list of testimonials and has done speaking events). I overcame my anxiety to see this person, knowing this is the first step towards fixing myself and towards a better, healthier life. 

But god it was a disappointment. It was worse than the worst-case scenario I created in my head. He didn't let me speak about my thoughts and feelings - he didn't even ask about my life. He just asked for some basic info and continued to ramble for over 2 hours while I stayed quiet and nodded my head. He made assumptions about who I am and I feel attacked (Eg. telling me that my parents did a bad job of raising me or saying I shouldn't choose to hide in my room all day even though I'm extremely active and go outside a lot). 

I feel exploited. The guy made easy money off of me (the session cost a lot) and provided me with 0 value - not even letting me speak. I'm financially in a tight spot and I feel extremely guilty for doing it. Its been a week and I feel extremely hopeless and depressed. I got over my anxiety to see someone and it turned out to be a horrible experience - that too with someone so highly ranked. This was supposed to be a big first step towards bettering myself and instead  I feel like my time, courage, and money went to waste. I feel like a burden and that there is no hope. I'm not sure why I'm struggling to get over it, but I just feel hurt over the experience. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? How do I get over this mental block? Is therapy even worth it or is it just endless talking? ",16Mar2019,1
16,"Im totally sane right now. My parents dont believe me. Im mad at them right now. I dont think they get me.

17,"Ive always been a person who smiles alot, at least people tell me that. I've also always been quiet. For my whole life ive never opened up to anyone, not even my parents. Im 17 now but I feel like the person i was 10 years ago wouldbt be happy with who i am today as i never really changed emotionally. Let me explain. When I was very young I used to just hide my face abd ignore teachers and people in general when they asked me if I was okay, and chose to sit with my head in my hands hoping to God that theyd just leave me alone. This behaviour still persists, because I remember this yeat being asked by my friend trinity if i was okay, only for me to follow it with a blank mind and nothing to state. The thing is, sometimes I feel anxious about just asking people if they want something, for example offering someone some food. Ill think it over until im too anxious to say anything, same with asking friends out to go do something. Back ti the smiling point at the start, I realized that maybe this is because Im trying to hide my emotion? I dont know if thats why I smile so often and laugh in stressing situations, but I think it could be. I fondly remember laughing in my grandma's funeral due to stress, and feeling outed by society for a week after due to my mind constantly thinking about it. I still think about it weekly. But anyway I know im rambling, but I dont even know if Im happy or not. when im in social situations my hands tend to sweat so much they drip, and people pointing that out makes my face go all red. But funny enough, my face going red makes me more embarrassed, making me sweat more and my face even more red, and ever repeating. Ive never seen a therapist but I feel so anxious that i cant even ask for help, I cant even get a forst job due to my weird stress. I dont know what to do, i feel like im going nowhere. ",16Mar2019,1

I once told a person about a  little of what goes on in my mind...They had nightmares and never talked to me again
How do you know what's real I see things and hear things they follow me everywhere I go I tell them to go away usually I can I hide it but lately people have started to notice My brain it frustrating it feels like someone else is controlling it no matter how hard I fight for control
There are two main ones that I deal with the most
The lady has appeared twice so far She always yells at me sometimes I understand her sometimes I don't but I feel her rage every time she yells.  She works for the creature. It seems like a man but it isn't I see it as a clown in my attic but at night it's a shadow that calls me it follows me. He makes sounds and stares at me to remind me they are always watching. They won't let me focus they're too loud I'm not scared of clowns so why it is a clown with his head popping out of my attic I don't know but it does know things I hate it makes them come after me when I don't listen to them I felt the spiders on me so I bit and scratched until there was only blood and I couldn't feel anything anymore. It is the leader of everyone they all listen to it

19,"I’m down visiting my bf for just under a week and I wanted to talk to him about a few things - needing some more reassurance and support - I was so scared to talk about it and so sad that I ended up crying for an hour and a half trying to explain how hard it is for me to ask for things (bc I’m used to being shouted at and called selfish after, no matter how big or small of a thing I ask for) and I needed to explain that bc he’s never experienced any REALLY bad MH problems, I don’t think he understands how hard the little things get, like showering and eating. 

So we were talking about my MH and he said he feels pathetic, that he can’t help well enough, “I’m just putting duck tape on the leak, I’m not actually doing anything.” He told me he wants me to go to a professional bc it’s starting to wear on him, and I already told him I’m thinking about upping my meds.

I’m so scared bc it means I’m not going forward, it’s means I’m still dependent. And that’s fucking terrifying. I was doing really good not that long ago, I’d say mid December. 
God damn seasonal depression is such a weird one. I was told as a kid by a therapist, when asking about if a pattern of low mood meant anything, “Don’t be silly, depression doesn’t have any kind of pattern” 
I responded, “As in time or thoughts?”

22,"Help! 
For the past few months I have grown increasingly angry and irritated with my therapist. I will snap at him or ignore him, or just generally become angry and irritated after speaking with him. Sometimes a prettt good day is ruined for me speaking to him. I feel like after at least 6 or more years of speaking with him almost weekly he should have a better understanding of me than it feels like he does...which is my best guess as to what is bothering me? I don’t typically show anger like this to anyone but family members. We have discussed it in session but I only become more annoyed. 
Is it worth to keep trying to fix? 
Or does this mean I need a new therapist?
Is this normal? I don’t understand why he is angering me so much and it’s not helpful because it makes me not want to speak to him or I waste the whole session angry after something he says.

24,"I’m not sure if this is allowed here but I can’t find a better sub - please let me know kindly if there is a better sub to post this in.

I think my husband has munchausen to some extent or at least is he worst malingerer known to mankind and I’m afraid where it’s going to take my life.

He constantly complains of aches and pains that are completely undetectable by anyone else and are symptom-less so that they can’t ever be disproved, and they always debilitate him to the point that he can’t function. I’ve started logging every time he complains and it is literally every day. I feel like he enjoys being the “patient“. I have also caught him in lies many times and I know that he does lie to me about not feeling well in order to get out of doing things with me or for me.

Last night he woke me up in a frenzy at 5 AM because his heart was pounding. Granted it was pounding, and I sometimes think whatever he has, is a mixture of malingering and then anxiety that perpetuates and makes every little thing worse. Which means sometimes he lies about feeling bad, but also takes the tiniest aches, pains, weird feelings that just come with being human, and literally thinks he’s going to die every single time. 

When he woke me up, he would not listen to reason and he demanded to go to the emergency room, just because his pulse was up. He has a Fitbit and he stood there obsessing and freaking out watching his pulse go up up up. It took me over an hour to calm him down. I ended up not getting any work done today because I was so exhausted from being up with him. This morning he thanked me for calming him down, and I pointed out “see, it was all in your head“ but he insisted that something must still be very wrong with him because he woke up to his heart pounding, and completely denies having a nightmare. So even though everything ended up being OK, he refuses to think so.

I’m also three months pregnant, and I always worried that by the time I got pregnant things would get worse with him, because the main attention would not be on him anymore. For example, as soon as I started getting morning sickness, he started being nauseous for the first time ever (he has never complained of nausea before). It is legit fear of mine that he will fake kidney stones (a classic of his) or something similar when I am in labor.

I have mentioned this to him, that his aches and pains are always conveniently timed. That was probably the worst fight we’ve ever had, he was so livid and defensive, I’m not sure if he freaked out because he knows that I’m onto him or if he genuinely believes that he is sick and I’m being a bitch about it.

He also has weird tendencies to always say “ow, ow, ow” when he wants to get out of a situation. Really, it’s embarrassing. He can be talking to my parents or to a group of coworkers and all of the sudden he “hisses” in pain and excuses himself. If he truly had chronic pain, he wouldn’t do that.  He also does it to me nearly every day, if I broach a particular subject that he finds boring (like babies for instance), and he makes a hiss, or goes “ow” in the middle of my sentences. He never ever exhibits any of this behavior when he is on the computer playing video games, it’s like a social coping mechanism. He even plays on the computer when he has a migraine ”so bad that he can’t see”.

I know this post is long enough and thank you if you made it to the end, I could keep going and I know at this point I’m just ranting but I guess the whole purpose of this post is to try to get some support and see if anybody has had a significant other with this problem and how to steer them towards getting help.

What the fuck did I do?
What did I do to deserve this?
I cried?
I cried and that was it
And now I'm going to die
I can't fucking breathe
I can't breathe!!!
This is love
This is my love for you
This is my love for you
This is from [older brother] to me
And then he takes me to concerts
As if that fucking makes up for it
Oh he's a changed man now, huh? So it's all alright?
It's all fucking alright???
Fuck you! You tried to murder me!
Or at least made me think that, you asshole! I've never heard an apology, not ever! Every time I've been in trouble you've just laughed! You've just laughed or got mad and made it worse! And you say family will always be there? Fuck you! I fucking hate your guts! Narcissist! Asshole! Narcissistic asshole! ""That's just how it works, older brothers are mean to their siblings"" yeah fuck you. You got raped, asshole. I hope you bled. Motherfucker. I hate you. Oh and you just give me drugs and take me to a concert so you can show off, and it's all alright, it's all supposed to make me feel good and look up to you as a brother. You're childish, you're insecure, and you're abusive, you disgusting, selfish, asshole. Fucking die, [older brother]. Fucking die. Or at least choke on your own fucking tears till you want to die, piece of shit. Fuck you. I fucking hate you. And you, [father]. For all your goodness, the few times you hurt me, it fucking hurt. It fucking hurt so bad, like it pierced me to the core. I said I wanted to die, I wanted to kill myself, and you said do it. That's always hurt. Ever since you said that. I didn't even realize it then how badly you had cut me. That's a mortal wound, you know that? You could have killed me. And my mom, my mom just sat by, she was on his side. She was mad at me for not doing my homework. It's not her fault I'm such a letdown, such a failure. No, how could it? She did so GOOD. SHE'S A GOOD PARENT. THERE'S NO WAY IT COULD BE HER FAULT THAT HER CHILD IS UPSET. Fucking bitch. Narcissist. I'm in a family of narcissists. I'm the only one with a fucking heart and it gets stepped while parading everyone else's. Thanks family, for loving me unconditionally. Thanks family, for reaching out to me, seeing how I'm doing, for pulling me up when I need it. Thanks family, for being those people in my life I've ALWAYS NEEDED. I LOVE YOU GUYS. FAMILY WILL ALWAYS BE THERE. WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. Lies. Lies. Lies! All of them. All liars. All cheats. All narcissists. I hate them. For all my love, and all the good memories, I fucking hate them more than words can tell.
There are good memories. They make me feel guilty for feeling this way. Isn't that fucked up? My parents took me to Mexico so I'm not allowed to hate them. They say I love you every day, passively, but they say it. They brought up [city] school of Arts and told me to audition, which I made it in. Shouldn't I love them? Shouldn't I be proud of them, and who they are, and everything they've done? My mom runs triathlons. My dad travelled the world and owned his own broadcasting network, and is one of the hardest working men I know. My mom sells [nutrition], which betters peoples lives. So why do I feel so neglected? Were they so busy doing everything for everyone else they forgot to look at me? And they blame me for isolating myself. ISOLATION WAS THE ONE BREAK I HAD FROM THIS HELL. I JUST WANTED A BREAK, I JUST WANTED A RELIEF, A LITTLE REST SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO FEEL SO SAD, BUT YOU TOOK THAT FROM ME AS WELL. MADE ME FEEL GUILTY FOR TRYING TO LOVE AND NURTURE MYSELF. THEN HAVE THE GALL TO TELL ME I'M DEPRESSED BECAUSE OF MY ""MINDSET"". FUCK YOU! You're so perfect, parents, you've never done anything wrong, oh poor parents have to deal with a transgender child, where did they go wrong? How did they miss the signs? It's her fault for never opening up. But when I do, you run and scream! And I have to comfort YOU! WHAT THE FUCK
My dad at least hugged me
He gets it
He gets emotion
But he doesn't pay attention to it
Not unless I directly bring it up with him
And I'm scared
If it upsets him, if he disagrees with it, what will he tell me next? Will he want me to disappear? I'm not sure, I'm scared. And [little brother]. You just never knew what was going on. I cared for you, cared about you, but it was never reciprocated. You just wanted to be cool like your brother, and learned to look down on me because that's what [older brother] did. And when I'm feeling weak, when I'm vulnerable, you left me just the same. ""Internalized self loathing""
""That's dumb""
-leaves-
Way to make me feel weak
Way to support your sister who has an identity that she never even realized until recently, with no help from anybody but herself. You're right, it is dumb. It's dumb to take my anger out on myself rather than you dumb fucks, it's dumb to internalize it rather than beating the living shit out of each and every one of you for what you've done to me. But I won't do that. I'm a good kid, and I don't want to hurt people. That's what my daddy who hurt me said. I'm a good kid and I don't want to hurt people. And I never have. Hurting people fucking sucks. Hell, ALL OF THIS fucking sucks. But that's just reality, and you'd better buck up, boy, because reality is just getting started. Even if you're a girl. The world doesn't give a shit. It will shit on you and you will cry, and when you reach out for help people will scoff and roll their eyes and leave you. Again and again and again. Only a few have proven themselves worthy, and even they still fuck up. But you're willing to forgive that, [me]. At least they didn't want you dead or tell you what to do just to make them happy. At least they didn't abuse you.

Feel guilty when you look upon the dead. People cry for them, but not for you. You're not worth it. You're still alive. Life is love. Living is love. Feeding, nourishing, clothes, home, shelter, a working job, this is love. Not emotions, not feelings, fuck, definitely not feelings. That fucks things up. No, just physical comforts, things, long life. This is love.

...I hate you

28,"my psychiatrist started me on lexapro 5mg. (For anxiety). I can’t swallow pills so I was told to crush it &amp; eat it with yogurt. I took it twice and I was shaking all night/couldn’t breathe so i stopped taking it. I went back a couple days later and he changed me to Prozac 10mg. It’s a capsule. I can’t swallow pills...so that’s 1 reason I don’t want to take it. 2nd reason is I’m scared of the side effects. I keep hearing it makes you suicidal and I don’t want that to happen. Just thinking about this makes me want to cry and throw it away and just not take anything .
I have my next appointment with him Wednesday . I literally see him for 5 mins and like that’s it. But what am I supposed to say if I go and he realizes I haven’t taken it? I have 2 bottles of antidepressants just sitting there. I don’t want him to think I’m abusing medication. I’m the one who said I wanted to try medication in the first place. I tried talking about it with my therapist but he like won’t make any comment about it bc he’s not a doctor.

29,"This internet thing that we've all become obcessed with  ,this compulsion to go online and offload . Or scroll around endlessly , wasting a lot of time .

I think it is more harmful than good and it is proven to be causing mental health problems  problems, wether you have mental ill health already , I think jt exacerbates it , it's hard to say 

But my point is , yea, sometimes it's good to vent and distract ourselves, but too much in my opinion could be stopping some people from actually sitting in the uncomfortableness of pain or failure and stress and actually learning from it , forced to become tougher more resilient . 

Look at this way . Long before forums and heavy internet use was the thing .your outlets where family , friends or social activities ,Life has always been difficult , the difference, You sat in pain  or stress and  learned ,you came to your own conclusions, I think the internet can create compulsions to vent maybe, and in doing that people begin to become overly sensitive to anything they question.

There was no obcessive venting apart from occasionally to  family or endless scrolling to the point you scan read and can barely remember what you read 10 minutes ago. Much less distractions or accepting  responsibility , you process and  become more motivated to do something about it your life 

I think sometimes people need to refocus, I think the internet can take away focus and  how you as an individual deals with certain things because you can avoid the uncomfortable.
People like to distract themselves and not live in the reality but by doing so they hinder the chance to find more opportunities.

I think if you have an addiction to the internet it seems to have removed responsibility between you and your problems , the connection is weakened  because you can keep distracting yourself , if your an anxious person the internet will keep you anxious, people will go online endlessly searching for answers ,it's like an addiction a compulsion , before  People literally forced new ways to adapt because it's all you could do protect yourself , no fake reality to hide in.

 I mean if you look at vr  , yea sure it's good for gaming , but people are testing out living in vr for a week straight  , some people are theorising if you could live in an alternative reality would you .

Obviously it's all a bit farfetched and not even a thing , but just the concept ,  people are trying to escape reality . Here's an idea , live in reality look at your internet addiction readapt your brain and adapt to reality   

 people would be more motivated to actually go out and spend more time with friends etc to get out of there head's. 

That's my interpretation. I think our obcession is making us more stressed and at the same time possibly making us less tolerant of stress more anxiety more depression.

30,"I am kinda at a loss for how to help. My best friend has CPTSD and has been having a hard time lately. She will not consider reaching out for any help at all because when she was struggling a few years ago with suicidal thoughts she admitted herself and was sexually assaulted by a staff member. She has zero trust in any mental health professional and most doctors, understandably. She knows all of the technicalities to NOT be admitted, like she has told me she knows what to say to never go back to that place again. She thinks all *daily mental health medications are dangerous and addictive, although she will take a half of an ativan very occasionally when she is overwhelmed. She medicates with marjiuana, and it seems to usually help. This is where my problem comes in; its not helping right now. She goes through this weird funk every spring. Like clockwork and I dont know why. She wont say. She is just super depressed and her anxiety is through the roof. She just tells me “ its childhood shit, ill get over it I don’t want to talk about it”. I see she is struggling, i want to help and still maintain our relationship. Any advice would be appreciated.

I had a job that was super short lived because I had a breakdown at work because I kept getting yelled at for messing up, and I’m not used to being yelled at that much. Basically I’m useless, and it’s embarrasing.
But I like to daydream. A lot. I spend hours just in my own head. And what I like to daydream about when I’m feeling really down is someone coming to rescue me. Like, protecting me from bad guys. Or comforting me when I’m having a panic attack. Or maybe tending to, like, my wounds or something. Stuff like that. I think I like to imagine that someone would actually put themselves in danger to help me.
My question is, should I stop this? I have a few major concerns when I think about it.
1) Is it selfish? 
2) I daydream too much- and although it’s usually the highlight of my day, I can feel myself becoming more detached. Is this because of my constant daydreaming?
3) Main point! I’m concerned that if I keep expecting someone to save me, I’ll never learn to save myself. And by that I mean actually becoming not-helpless. 
But the rescue fantasies are so comforting! And fun! And it’s nice to imagine someone who cares about you that much.

The court decided to place her in a psych ward and they never revealed where they sent her. I’ve tried calling psych wards in the area but they all say that she needs to give permission first??? Don’t they know  you’re not able to make appropriate judgements if you have a mental illness? 

They say to wait until she gets discharged and have her call us, but me and my dad both changed our phone numbers.

39,"Recently I went through an extremely stressful time at work. I felt like I needed to be ""on"" literally 24/7 because I was traveling with my team including my boss and we were all always together. The trip had exciting amenities and while I was there it seemed like it was this fabulous and great thing. After I got home, within 24 hours I was broken. For the first time I felt like I could not control what I thought. Usually when a particularly negative thought comes in my head I can identify it and change my perspective. But this time I had no juice left. Not only could I not change my thoughts but they felt real. I could not even tell that they were awful until retrospect. It was pure exhaustion. I broke down constantly at nothing in these crying fits. It didn't matter where I was or what I was doing. That lasted a few days and then I felt frozen most of the time. Everything was overwhelming. I could see that I was in this dark place but didn't have any power to pull myself out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just decided to wait and not make any decisions until I felt better because my ideas of what I should do were definitely not good and if I couldn't think of anything else, then I was at least not going to do harm. I would do nothing before I would do harm. So I stayed frozen. There were a few times when I would feel better and think it was over and try to push myself to put effort into something but multiple times after trying I would revert back to square one. A blubbering mess that couldn't even shop for groceries. It seemed I was trapped and that I was becoming a burden to people close to me.

40,"My first job is so terrible, the story is so long and detailed I can't even explain it in one post. But I'll pull out some stories just to get things off my chest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background: When I was 17 I got my first job. I worked full time, went to high school full time and moved out at 18. I was trying to save and escape from a abusive household. Children's services wouldn't help me and said I just need to leave when I'm 18. Thus, my first job at 17. 

Story 1: When I was a new employee - about 2 months in - I was pretty much the goody goody of the work place. I tried to work harder then the rest since I felt like I had something to work harder for. One night, it was just me and 1 other employee in the back. At about a few minutes past 10 someone had driven into the drive through. They ordered fries and a sandwich. We had some old fries that looked quiet nasty sitting in the fry stand. I already knew the fresh rule. So I began to open a new bag and tried to pour a handful of fries in the fryers. (this process would take about 2:30 min) But they would get fresh fries. The other employee came around the corner and yelled, ""What are you doing??? We are trying to get out of here."" ""But... I was taught to-"" ""Who cares!"" she grabbed the bag and put it back and used the old fries. She put them on the serving stand and yelled ""DRIVE THRU!"". She had been there for 4 years so I wasn't about to argue. I just went back to cleaning the prep tables. But when the co-manager walked past. She looked at me and yelled, ""WTH IS THIS?"" I looked her holding the old fries. ""DO YOU HONESTLY THINK WE ARE GONNA SERVE THESE? Put some new ones on NOW!"" I couldn't even speak about it... I just took the blame. No one stood up for me anyway. I guess you can argue, why didn't you say the other person did it? Because it was one of those, ""Don't be a snitch"" and also, ""So what if she said to do it, you should have been assertive and did the right thing!"" But I felt like she had power over me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Story 2: A employee (who was a girl) would slap me on my butt on multiple occasions. I told her to stop. When she asked why, I told her about my abuse at home. One of the most annoying and shameful things my mom would do was poke me in the butt whenever she walked by. Idk if any other parents does this. But like with a pool or a stick or just slap my butt. It wasn't a sexual thing- just something to make me jump. But I told my co-worker that it was the reason why I didn't like it. It made me jump. But she just laughed and told the other employees like it was a joke. It may have sounded that way- but I made it clear it was quite traumatizing for me anyway. Considering the home life I came from. Everyone just told me to grow up and get over it.

&amp;#x200B;

Story 3: My main manager (the boss) would come into work everyday always in a bad mood. Even when things were quiet and clean she always found someone or something to argue and yell about. I guess she was upset she was 45 and all she had to live up to was being a manager at a burger joint. Dispute me working their for 7 months. The manager never gave me my raise. Dispute it being due literally after 3 months (after I take my trainee's exams). I took them and passed and she never got to it. Even when I asked it was, ""I'm too busy."" and yet people who had just started got their raises before me. Finally she called me in for evaluation. When I sat down she gave me a paper with my results. She wrote my attitude was the worst part about me. I was confused. My attitude? I worked in the back without customers. I was quiet and only spoke to vent sometimes to my co-workers. But I never spoke out of line. I asked her about this and she replied, ""It's not the way you speak. You just always look depressed."" ""But... I have depression. I work in the back, it's not hurting any of the customers or my work performance. "" ""But when I have a bad day, I like to come into work leaving my baggage behind... and seeing you down makes me feel more down. It affects me."" Coming from the person who always bring their baggage to work to begin with!!! then she said, ""Just put on your happy face for work!"" Dispute me saying I can't just pretend to be happy all the time.

43,"Hi there!

I’ll make this as brief as I can but I was looking for peoples opinions on what might have happened to my girlfriend last night.

We were laying in bed and she was reading her book when suddenly she said her legs were itching but didn’t feel like her own. She then mentioned that she’d been having this a lot recently where her hands and legs feel “there” and she can control them but they don’t feel like hers and she has an urge to scratch them or claw at her face. 

All of a sudden it went from 0 to 100 and she was basically writhing in bed and crying that she wasn't herself and then went into an almost stoned haze where she would respond about things she needed to do the next day and say she wasn't crazy and then disappear somewhere in her head for 10 seconds or so before forgetting the previous chat. 

We then went downstairs on my insistence to get her walking around and I hoped this would improve things but it didn't and she ended up being up with me and her mum (who I called down) and drifting between being stoned and drugged looking and panicking about things she needed to do and crying that she felt possessed. 

I actually called the emergency services and they said a doctor will call back today which is good and eventually she did slowly come back to her senses around 00:00 but said she still didn't feel right until this morning where she says she feels absolutely fine again but is concerned about it happening again and wants to get to the bottom of it.

It's also worth noting she's been on duluxotine 60mg for about 3 weeks now after they upped her dose for some slight post natal depression.

I have no clue what is wrong with me and what is happening with me mentally. Lately I've been not eating as much, I've gotten to the point I don't eat unless it's the normal time, if I don't wake up in time for a normal time to eat I don't eat at all, let's say for example; if I miss breakfast/lunch I don't eat unless it's dinner. Do you understand my point? I've been replacing my snacks with water and been feeling more slow probably due to the fact of me not eating.  


I have no idea what is happening and I've talked to my boyfriend about this because earlier today I've flipped out at dinner and threw my food/headphones because my brother commented on my weight because I'm a big guy over 200 pounds which is unhealthy for the age of 14.   


If you could tell me what's happening, please do.",16Mar2019,1
46,"I just wanna start off by saying that I HATE MYSELF so much right now for doing this. None of you could imagine, but I REALLY need to reach out to some of you, so here I am, slowly regretting it, but doing it anyway.

I'm only 18 years old, I'm a university student studying Mechatronic Engineering. I've suffered from depression. Or at least I think that I have. I've been so lonely for as long as I can remember. And I still get this feeling of emptiness from time to time.

But being the little boy that I am, I've always looked up to superheroes. Especially to how they went through the most horrible things, but instead of hurting others, or themselves, they chose to help people out. I figured that it does make things a bit easier. And it was true. Even the tiniest of gestures. Seeing somebody happy made ME happy.

Now I don't know what I'm doing here. I think this may even be a huge mistake. But at least I'll go down trying, right?

So I thought long and hard and came up with an idea.  I want to do what I can to make sure that NOBODY feels this way, because it's dark, and lonely out there and because nobody should go through any of it. So I went online and built a website. I called it Alleviate. Which is a word that means to make problems less severe. It's just a community. It came to mind that people may not be able to afford therapists. So I thought that one approach could be to have all of us help each other out under one platform. You can follow a certain topic ranging from ADHD, postpartum depression, anxiety, and many more. There is a full disclaimer that the site doesn't offer a cure, or any of that, It's just a place for ranting and helping each other feel even just a LITTLE better.

Here's a link to the website: [https://alleviate.mn.co](https://alleviate.mn.co/)

I promise, all I want to do is help and all I ask from you is for any of you to just check it out, and if you want to join, you can sign up. I want a place for us and ONLY us. And while there is this subreddit and many more, it still doesn't feel like ours. And if I see that this idea helps people and actually benefits them, I'll turn it into a real thing from scratch.

All I ask for you to do is check it out and if you feel like you could maybe benefit from it, please sign up. The number of members that I get there would be an indicator of whether this should be built or not. All I want to do is help. I'm not making any money from this whatsoever. Its ALL free and I'm not planning or going to allow any advertising or anything. It's just something that I wanted to do that was ""good"". I'm just an 18 year old kid in his first year of university. If you hate  on me after this, I understand.  I feel like a dipshit for posting something like this here, because I'm the type that hates the people that do this and here I am doing it. I deserve whatever comes my way.

Thanks anyway though.",16Mar2019,9

People who have discovered they experienced sexual abuse have you had thoughts of suicide? not necessarily wanting to act on it and if so does it get better? 
I've just started therapy but my concern is if it's like this now will it get worse? I'm going to tell my therapist these thoughts and I'm aware of the hotline and everything so don't feel obligated to rush to my aid just merely curious of others experiences

49,"I'm not one to publicly share my problems on the internet, especially on here. But it's extremely late and I figured that it would help me relieve some of this tension I have in my head. Recently, I've been feeling like my life is extremely unfair. I don't know whether or not my life has suddenly took an unlucky turn these past few years. I started off high school and was able to branch out and make new friends. I didn't have the easiest time, but thinking back now I'd say I had a much better and easier past. Now that I'm a senior, things have changed so much. My closest friends have left me for genuinely no reason (one of my best friends stopped talking to me after getting a date and never bothered to speak to me again). My life just doesn't live up to my expectations. My most deepest desires and goals are rejected no matter how much effort I put into achieving them. The attention and affection that I strive to earn from others is given to people who don't think twice about it. People are out here getting praised and glorified for the smallest of things and I can never seem to get an ounce of that. I feel like I'm always putting in the extra effort to get what I want, and that's not out of my choice. It feels like I HAVE to put in more effort, no matter what I do - things just always seem so much harder for me than for others. Now, I'd say I'm a pretty determined person and I work so hard for what I want. I strive to improve myself and improve my strengths and skills in what I can do. But sometimes it just genuinely gets so exhausting to put all of that energy into these small little things. 

It's hard for me to phrase this in a way that makes me feel like the only person I feel bad for is myself. I am grateful for so many things in my life. Each day has a struggle for me, but I am thankful to have the people in my life who encourage me to overcome them. At the same time, I can't help but think that these small superficial desires that I'm able to have will never live up to the loss I face when it comes to my bigger and more important desires. Buying a new shirt is easy for me. But that temporary joy I get from that just doesn't live up to the joy I want to get after an audition for a role I've always wanted or becoming successful in general. 

And all that disappointment channels my anger when I'm frustrated and I can't help but look at my life and look at the world with a bitter eye. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong and I can't find a way out of this.",16Mar2019,2
50,"Hey reddit folks, I have a lifelong serious aversion to doing anything I consider ""organizing"" like dishes/laundry/tidying up/showering/brushing teeth/throwing out trash/punctuality and addressing things like paying bills or going through mail etc. I can't bring myself do to these things without feeling dread and stalling as long as possible but after I eventual do them there is no problem completing the task it's just before I start I feel mental anguish at just the idea of handling things. It has been so bad at times that as a teen I'd often starve because I couldn't wash a pot in the sink to be able to cook and even went so far once to just throw all the dishes out and go buy NEW pots and pans to avoid it. Mind you we're not talking dirty filthy disgusting dishes just mildly used and completely rinsed ones that just need a quick 2 min wash with a sponge. I couldn't bring myself to do that simple 2 min wash without wanting to cry and rather just be dead then go through with it. An INTENSE feeling of anguish but when I have some momentum and get started on tasks I'm fine handling them and the dread isn't always constant its sometimes stronger typically when more tasks are pending or one is critically needed. I also feel like things are wrong when I don't address things so it's not like I'm just lazy and wanna ignore stuff I actively WANT to address them and get on with my day and not doing them makes the rest of the day feel off or bad. I otherwise seem normal and nobody can tell that I'm going through this crap on a daily basis though I've casually called myself ""OCD"" not from any diagnosis just based off how ignoring tasks makes me feel horrible and throws off my day. I plan on seeing a professional but I don't really know what professional I should see since I don't have even a guess at what my problem could be. I have a nephew who is diagnosed OCD and I'm def not like that I don't habitually organize anything or repeat stuff like washing hands it's just this mental block when dealing with chores/errands/self care. I would say it's the tediousness of the tasks but I am totally capable of doing repetitive tedious work in other aspects without the same dread though I do stall going to work I love it once I'm there. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated I'm just hoping to get an idea of what to look into or who to talk to about it and to see if anyone else has any experience with this stuff as I haven't been able to nail it down off googling. Thanks for reading :-)",16Mar2019,3

59,"Hi everyone. I am seeing a pyschologist soon so I thought it would be good to write down all my family problems to print and give to them. I procrastinated doing it so much because I didn't want to think about it. No matter how much I tried to remember, my brain would push the memory to the back of my head. I literally had to force myself to remember things, and then all at once everything came back. I started to get the impending doom feeling, like  you're in a small room and the walls are caving in on you. My chest really hurt and stung too, I got hiccups and they were painful in my chest (which I get hiccups every now and then, but no chest pain). So I wrote my list, there's still more stuff I need to add but I think I'll leave it as it is. I have a terrible short-term memory, my long-term memory was actually really good, I could remember details. Sometimes it is a burden because I'll remember too much. When I woke up, I noticed, I don't know if I was like this before (never really thought about it) but I don't really remember much of my life. Like I know who my friends are, and I have vague images of memories with them. Like the really happy ones, I have a few. Most of the memories don't have emotion, and have no details. Normally my mind would wonder through memories and I might get upset thinking of something bad that happened years ago, now I know that something unpleasant happened with a person but I don't remember the details. I'll literally have to sit there and think hard, but I go blank. My mind isn't wondering through thoughts, I can literally stop trying to remember a conversation and my mind's just like ""Okay I won't try to remember too"". Could it be I pushed too much suppressed memories out and they all came out at once ? and because I haven't processed them and gave myself an anxiety or panic attack, my brain is like ""Fu\*\* this I'm out"" and shut off all my memory so I won't feel that way again. I know that my memories are there, it's like my brain locked them away in a room and has access to the key, I don't have it. If I hear a song or see something specifically related to the memory, I'll be like ""Oh yeah, that happened"" so it's not gone, just put away.

I also get monthly shots of abilify (300mg) for schizophrenia. These are the only two medications I’m taking.

A few people close to me has noticed a change in me since starting oxcarbazepine. To be honest it’s a good change, I get out the house more and am more talkative to those close to me. Even occasionally saying hello to those I walk past. I generally feel better.

People probably won't read this anyways, so there's no real need to be so weirded out. Alright, here goes I suppose. For some context, I live in Australia, so some things may sound weird.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, to any who read this, thank you, and I apologise in advance for the long read.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 7? That sounds about right. When I was 7 my father and mother separated. I didn't really understand at the time what was really going on, but it was a thing I suppose. I didn't see much of him anyways as he worked at sea, only coming back once every month or so. I was a pretty average kid at a Christian school. In year 2, a couple years later, I was popular? I don't think that's the right word. The older kids all crowded around me and made me feel special because I suppose in their eyes I was probably cute. I was good at soccer etc. I had a good amount of friends and was genuinely happy and outgoing. I would attend parties, play with other kids, all that nonsense. But nearing the end of the year, I was asked if I wanted to move away. Not really understanding what it meant, and wanting to make my other happy, I agreed. We moved across state just before the start of 2008 I believe, so I was 10 by that point. I thought things were going to be pretty much the same. They weren't.

I started year 3, but nobody was really hanging out with me. I wanted to, I tried to get into friend groups, make friends any way I could think of, but I think I must have been the first transfer student since these kids had entered Primary (Elementary) school. Nobody really wanted to hang out with me, and it made me upset, but it wasn't too bad. When I hit year 4, the bullying began to start. Just words and the occasional shove or whatever, but every time I got upset or told someone, more than anything it seemed to just make it all worse, like they knew nothing was really going to be done. 

I can't remember which year level I started or finished AFL, but I think I did it for 2 years. It must have started in year 3 I think, because I went into highschool with some other training beforehand, but that's for later. In football things were worse. I was a short slightly built kid. I was fast, which was good, but the bullies were much worse there. They had excuses to hurt me physically, and it could easily be called an accident. It rarely was, they would do things like hit me in the sides of my thighs (F\*\*king hurts), trip me when it was rainy, tackle me overly harshly, stuff like that. I think I only ever scored one goal in 2 years, which may have to do with the fact I was rarely put on the field, and for some reason I was often in defense. Maybe it was to do with one of the main bullies being the Coach's son? I don't know honestly, that part is only speculation. 

In year 6? Or maybe partway through the year before that. I started doing martial arts to teach me control, and in case any bully ever decided to get too physical. It was fun, I made friends pretty quickly, but by then I had already, I suspect, begun to fall to depression. I had gone from being light-hearted and happy, to lonesome and morose. I quickly became one of the more disciplined and strict seeming students in the dojo. Whilst others would muck around and have fun, my stance and demeanour were usually rather serious and stoic. Occasionally my 'mask' would slip and I would smile and laugh and whatnot, but I often more or less told myself off for doing so. Year 6 went better than the previous years. I made friends with students in the lower year levels, and some of the kids in my own were more friendly to me, but (And I apologise for how dramatic this sounds) the damage had already been done. 

Onto year 7. It started out nice, made some friends, discovered anime, which I loved instantly. I made a group of friends and things were alright. But even in the group of friends I was somewhat of an outcast. I felt like they wanted to include me, but A. most of them were females and B. it felt as though some invisible barrier kept us really from connecting. I made 2 other friends though, and they were awesome, but then came Kenny. Kenny, was an utter piece of crap, the worst of anyone in that year level. Now, I don't know if he had some shit going on at home, but he was always by himself because of how pretty much nobody liked him. He would pick on everyone pretty much. One of my friends, D, was a little overweight, probably double me (Though keep in mind I was still rather short). Kenny loved picking on D, and D wasn't good at controlling his temper and would often chase after Kenny, but wasn't fast enough to catch up. One time, I actually helped trying to chase Kenny off, and usually I would be with Duncan telling Kenny to more or less F off. Kenny eventually got his comeuppance when he picked on the biggest kid in the year level and got decked, but that's another story. 

Enter year 8. I think it was this year I went full nerd. I was a tech captain, and a library monitor. I think this was the year I started the chess club in my school (There wasn't one previously, though it wasn't really much of a club anyways). Me and my new friend Jack would often play, as the 2 friends mentioned earlier had both moved away by then. It was rather fun, and I often won in chess against any of the other students. But being now 'the lonely nerd' I was constantly verbally abused, and just harassed in general. One thing that has stuck with me is one bully who was in a maths class with me at the time, was kind of ranting at me calling me stupid and whatnot, before adding 'And that's why your father left you'. I was devastated. I wasn't violent or aggressive in any way, and I kind of just went to another room and started bawling my eyes out. The teacher more or less gave him a slap on the wrist. Year 9 was much of the same, boring insults and harassment.

Year 10, it escalated, both at home and at school. I think it was that year I received my laptop, and I was pretty much always on it at home. I loved it I discovered RP and was doing it all the time, in or out of school. At school, during lunches, me and my friends would hang out in a room separate from the library, but going into the library was the only entry. I had been given permission to use this room as my clubroom, though most of the people there were just my personal friends who wanted a place to hang out during lunch without being harassed. However, bullies would now begin harassing us from outside the windows and from in the library, as there were windows on all the walls except for one that led to a storage area that students weren't allowed in. It was a nuisance, but not too bad. When they didn't get a rise out of us, they would begin to barge into the room and make a ruckus, teasing us and acting like angels whenever teachers came by. Again, a nuisance but I was kind of over it by that point, I'd developed a bit of thickness to both my skin and heart, not letting much in or out. Another event that has stuck with me even now, is kind of a funny one actually. One day, a friend and myself were on the school bus that would take us home, and the same kid who had made that comment about my dad said 'You know what I want to do tonight' at us. Now, I didn't know at the time, that his sister had died some time ago, and I said, 'Fuck your sister?'. He grabbed me by the back of the head and basically said I was dead meat. The next day, I was collecting my books from my locker, my hands were full. Keep in mind at this point, I had been doing martial arts for the good part of 5 years. He came up behind me while I was talking to a friend, and slugged me across the jaw. I crouched down because I was a little shocked, but it didn't hurt at all. My adrenaline was pumping like mad, but even before and after that, it wasn't hurting. I kinda just looked at him and more or less said, 'is that all you got'. We both got in trouble, but he didn't bother me so much after that.

That's when the bullying more or less stopped. There was the occasional remark, but nothing I hadn't heard a million times before. Stuff still got to me every now and then, but not anywhere near as often. However, my mum had a new boyfriend who taught her how to limit when my internet was on or not, how to blacklist sites etc. At this point, there were probably 5 things I enjoyed; Anime, RP, talking to my friends, Reading and martial arts. Now, a lot of the friends I talked to were on this RP site called Chatango, which I spent a lot of time on. But most of them were also overseas, so I couldn't talk to them at regular hours. My mum, likely fearing for my academic wellbeing, set it so I could only use the internet until Midnight each night, which was fine, but then she made it so I could no longer use Chatango. I was pretty devastated. Most of my friends I could only talk to on there, and the school internet had it blacklisted too. I knew nothing of VPN's at that point. I didn't really have any solid friend groups at the time, I was more or less a drifter, and I couldn't talk to any friends I had on Skype often because they were all in America or Europe. When the it got close to spring break, my mother confiscated my laptop from me completely, no use of it at all, even for school work. My mums boyfriend put an administrator password on it to prevent me accessing it. During spring break, I ran away from home for 2 weeks, staying with my ex girlfriend at the time, kind of just moping around, using her laptop to go on Chatango, that kinda thing. I eventually went back home, but still didn't have the laptop until a few months later.

When I hit year 11, things weren't much better. I could use the laptop freely for the most part, but no Chatango, and internet shut off at 10 at night. I managed it, but it was tough because most of the things I loved were on the internet. Midway through year 11, I stopped martial arts. Partially because of the cost, but also because the depression had gotten to the point where I had a withdrawal kind of effect when I came home from martial arts. The dopamine and euphoric feeling would occur during training, and it was fun, but when I got home I felt like garbage, mentally, I was fine physically with the training. Later that year, I think during September, my mum wouldn't let me use the laptop outside of supervised homework. My girlfriend at the time lived in Colorado, and she was my everything. I lost all contact with her for months, and many other friends, and began to spiral. I took initiative though and began seeing the school psychologist for help, doing screeners and whatnot (I'll post rough results at the end), and I was put on Anti Depressants.

When I got to year 12 I was allowed to use the Laptop freely, as long as I did 2 hours supervised homework every single night. It was shit, but I didn't often do all that much homework, as my mother didn't pay all that much attention. Now, my grades had begun dropping. I don't know if it's because of my mental disorders, but they definitely contributed a lot directly and indirectly. I had begun losing all motivation to do anything, things I found fun were now often just things that stopped me from being in my own head, but not really all that fun. Around March of that year, I got back with my girlfriend in Colorado in May I believe. We were going strong, and I was really happy because of it, on 20mg Lovan, and my best friend who lived in America as well, would RP and talk with me often, and a friend at my school, I found out, also loved RP, so things were getting a little better. However, early November, my best friend suddenly 'ghosted' me, and I was in the dumps. I had, and still have, a fear of abandonment, and I was hit hard. About a month later, my girlfriend said, for reasons I won't get into, that she had to move to her Aunt's house, who didn't have internet, but she would try to keep in touch. That was another blow, but I finished Highschool not long after, passing though not really getting great grades. At one point, after I graduated, I moved away from home for a little while to do some work. Bartending was really fun, kept my mind busy, and didn't give me a withdrawal effect afterwards. I was still hanging on that my girlfriend would contact me. I moved to my grandma's for a short while, still holding on, working in sales. Nothing. I knew it was pointless but I couldn't let her go. I didn't care if she dumped me, I just wanted to keep talking with her, to be her friend. Eventually, because I wasn't earning enough, and my mental state was effecting my grandma, I had to move back in with my mother. 

At this point, my father hadn't seen me in 4 years, and my mother and I would often argue and get in verbal fights, with her very occasionally hitting me. One of the first things she talked to me about was my medication that I was still on. I had recently Cold Turkeyed the use of it, as it did nothing, but she didn't know. She told me that weed was much better for depression and that her friend, who was supposedly the head of the psychology division at Harvard, told her antidepressants were only supposed to be used for a maximum of 12 months. I call f\*\*king bullshit, and it pisses me off to this day that she said that. We still get in arguments pretty often about various things. I have been self harming (Burns and cuts) on and off for the better part of 3 years now. More recently, my suicidal Ideations have become worse. I constantly think that, if many more of my close friends leave me, I won't have a reason to live, that I could count the people who would care if I died on my fingers, and that it was bad. Just today actually, I calculated the Force(N) Energy(J) time until impact(s) G's experienced on impact, deceleration on impact(m/s\^2) velocity on impact(km/h) and equivalent energy in TNT (J &gt; kg TNT) of someone of my weight jumping off the tallest building in my state's major city. Probably not a good thing. I keep a scalpel and some razor blades hidden under my mattress for cutting, and have multiple matches and lighters to burn myself when I feel like I have no other option, though I only ever harm, at the moment and in the past, where I know I wouldn't die due to it.

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically the gist of everything. I don't know what I'm expecting out of this. I probably just want people to feel bad for me and am trying to trick them into wanting to help me, or something of the like. But Feedback and general help would be appreciated.

I had two panic attacks in the end of January. I’ve not had a single one since. My psychiatrist said that I do not have panic disorder nor do I have generalized anxiety disorder. However, I still do feel tense 2 days out the week, and it frustrates me. He says it’s just the after effects of a panic attack, some people are more sensitive than others. It happens.

My question is, has this happened to any of you that don’t have Panic Disorder or GAD? It’s been about 6 weeks. I still feel tense randomly.",16Mar2019,2
69,"So I’ve had this for quite a long time, I’m not sure what this is, but nonetheless here is what happens;
So the other day I was watching a video about SAS Training (the armed forces inspire me) and after they finish doing a bunch of exercises I felt sore, and exhausted too. My arms hurt as if I had done pushups, pull-ups, my legs hurt like I was running, It was like I had just done it myself.
But I didn’t, I was at home, being a lazy ass watching YouTube.

Another example is;
If someone gets kicked in the stomach I’ll cringe and (most times) even feel it too.
When someone touches a certain type of metal (that really iron smelling one) I can feel it too.
If someone gets hurt in their mouth area, my teeth will hurt as if that was me, but it wasn’t, I was at home.

Seeing someone doing something as ripping open a cardboard box can make me feel the cardboard in my hands.
I watch a couple reviews here and there, whenever the person (for example) runs a knife down there arm to feel it, I can feel that cold blade on my own arm.

I talked to a friend that had a degree in something mental health related, and he thinks it’s
Mirrored Touch Synesthesia.
What do you guys think and what should I do?",16Mar2019,1

Two of my closest friends aren’t coming due to a situation. Basically ones boyfriend was abusing her, I had evidence and reported it. She thought other friend reported it, other friend told me I needed to make it right and I was having a panic attack and texted “please just fucking stop” because I couldn’t handle it at the moment.

76,"I’m smack bang in the middle of a family breakdown. A close family member has recently been incarcerated for having sex with a minor. The minor was my niece. This seems pretty straight forward, except my niece is adopted from within a broader family context and the family member who has been arrested isn’t actually related.  I’m currently torn between the obvious issues of not understanding that I still feel empathy and confusion, yet no anger to the perpetrator and a ridiculous amount of anger I feel towards my nieces adoptive mother (my sister) for years of lies.  He has perpetrated a sexual offence, yet I seem to be transferring all of my rage to my sister, whom I don’t have a great relationship with due to significant and harmful lies in the past.  I can sit on the outside and know this is some kind of transfer, I just don’t seem to be able to rationalise this.

Ive been a doormat for too long, and i realize that its been no good for anyone.

Things ive tried that sort of work, but arent necessarily healthy
- exercise
- throwing things

79,"So, as the title says. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and am doing Dialectal Behavior Therapy. I've been doing it since August of last year... and I don't think I'm getting any better. This therapy is useless to me. Most of it is distraction/meditation (which I already did way before I was diagnosed) and radical acceptance, which is bullshit. Why am I supposed to accept everything? Not even a normal person does that.

I have spirals all the time about everything, and when I bring them up to my therapist, I feel like it's just a ""Why Neuro is Wrong"" hour. I'm told to do the radical acceptance, and learn to control my emotions. Yeah, I'm working on that, it's obviously not making things better. I don't feel validated in therapy, so much so that I make it a point to spend my sessions venting about what happened the previous week so by the time the hour is up, there's no time to tell me I'm feeling the wrong way.

I feel like my therapist should at least validate my feelings once in a while. I feel like I'm not allowed to feel the way I do, and that sucks, because I can't control it initially happening. My feelings and emotions are so heightened and it really hurts when even my therapist is basically telling me stop being a baby (she doesn't say it this way, but it feels like that's her point).

Am I the only person who feels like DBT is a crap therapy? Is there another type of therapy that may be better, or maybe I just need to get on some medication? I'm just so frustrated and I feel like I've been doing this therapy for months and it's just the same thing over and over: distract and accept. I don't think it's facilitating growth.

Hey everyone,

I have been getting extremely bad panic attacks since my surgery, or should I say when I woke up from it...

This is a link to my surgery in way more detail:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/b07z2f/if_successful_ill_be_1_in_14_billion_wish_me_luck

For those who don't click the link, I basically had grade 5 AC separation and a severe brachial plexus injury from the same injury (only 5 other cases reported in the world, wahoo me...). I haven't been able to feel my arm for over a week. I won't dive into that just click the link for more details.

What happened after my surgery was the most traumatic experience I have ever had. I had been given ketamine to go to sleep after my surgery was done. I woke in a panic around 6 am, cold, confused, excrusiating pain, catheter, and vulnerable. In that moment I felt like I was going to die. I had no idea what was going on, I was just flat out scared shitless. I ended up passing out due to my high heart rate, all I remember is all the alarms started going off and then blank.

I have had a harsh past growing up from rape, abusive family, bullying, terrible school experiences, getting cheated on 3 times in a row, losing friends, mom lying about my real parents, the list goes on. Due to this I have severe depression and PTSD (just got diagnosed).

Unfortunately since that traumatic morning, the scariest time in my life really and usually nothing scares me ever, I have been getting panic attacks. These arnt just little panic attacks either. Full on uncontrollable ones with buckets full of tears. I noticed I have been very anxious as well. I finally talked to a psychiatrist today and was properly diagnosed with severe PTSD and severe depression. From my past it makes sense....

I need help badly! I am currently still in the hospital due to my extreme nerve pain from my brachial plexus and AC joint (been 8 days now). Even after surgery the pain and lack of feeling is increasing( I was aware of the possible risks of my surgery (having a dead arm). Last night was my worst panic attack yet where I couldn't stop crying for over a hour if not two hours. 

I can tell when they are coming on as I feel anxious and mad. Soon after i can't breath well and i want to be alone. Then the tears start pouring in and I can't control it. 

I need advice on what to do at this point or a coping mechanism. Is lorazepam a good option? They already have me on Amitriptyline (they told me it was plain meds....) and now I'm going to start on Sertraline. Will have a combo of the two and hopefully things get better but so far nope.

Things arnt looking good for me physically and mentally, I need some kind words and advice. For those who remember me I never did admit myself to the hospital but now I'm ready to face my fears, happy I didn't do the unthinkable and I'm now in a safe place. ❤

81,"(Background) I’m 16 M and I’ve not been diagnosed with any sort of mental health issues and I’ve also avoided self diagnosing but I recently went to the doctors with migraines and they said it was most likely stress induced. 

Recently I’ve been feeling really irritable by the people around me. I find myself being rude and dismissive, basically acting like a total jerk, for no reason. I’ve also noticed a lack of motivation and feeling really tired in morning which has lead to me skipping days off school only to feel guilty about it later. When I do wake up it seems like my day is already going downhill and I need to find a reason for it to be a good day and to feel happy. Even though I’ve been pushing away the people closest to me like friends and my own mother by acting like a dick the only time I really feel happy is when I’m with friends. In particular a close friend I have who I’ll call H. I have feelings for her but she doesn’t feel the same way yet we still spend time with each other at the weekends as friends and it’s the only time I don’t feel miserable. She’s really cool about the whole thing and she talks about my feelings for here with me as it kinda helps with the whole situation and makes me feel less depressed about it. 

About a week ago H had a bit of a scare with her anorexia as she passed out as a result of not eating enough and she thought she was gonna relapse but thankfully she didn’t (She has been recovering since 2018) . That whole thing scared the shit out of me as not only is she my closest friend but I have feelings for her and I felt as though I was useless as I was unable to help her in that whole situation. The week before she was constantly saying she was overweight and ugly and I kept trying to convince her she wasn’t and so when she did pass out I kind felt responsible and felt that maybe if I said something different or if I was able to convince her she’s not overweight or ugly that she wouldn’t have passed out.

Anyway I know this all kinda a bit all over the place but I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this and I don’t want to bother H with it as she’s still focusing on her own mental health.",16Mar2019,1

86,"There is so much stigma about BPD and pwBPD being automatically abusive. 

Other subreddits literally just hate on pwBPD and claim that they’re venting and that it helps them get over their trauma.

Thing is they say horrible things and generalize all of us, and make me feel like a bad person just for my diagnosis. 

And worse, I can’t even say anything to defend myself or comment cause those subreddits have rules about people with BPD interacting at all.

This is discrimination (imo) that someone thinks they can shit on me cause of my disorder, and then when I try to defend myself they say “you can’t post here, you have BPD. Fuck off” 

Is it just me who sees this as damaging and wrong? 

Also people on these subreddits make horrible comments about their current spouses. Sure, sometimes people with BPD can be hard to handle or even abusive, but leave them then, don’t pretend to love them while you shit on them online.

So I've always had impulses to do stupid stuff, sometimes things that could result in harming myself or others. I get these impulses several times a day, but luckily super rarely act on them. The usual ones are to say something needlessly insulting to a friend, smack a girl's ass, or throw away my phone. I can't be on my phone while in a car with the windows down because I feel drawn to throw my phone out the window. I also cant be on my phone when over a balcony for the same reason.

What really concerns me is when the urges can hurt someone. Somtimes I get the urge to jump in front of a bus or to floor my car and kill pedestrians crossing in front of me.

I usually tighten my body and close my eyes for a second and the feeling goes away before i do anything stupid. The only time I've actually acted on the impulse was a long time ago and I didnt hurt anyone. I also don't have a history of any mental illnesses, so hopefully that isnt related.

This morning, at around lunchtime, I went on social media to find some relief from a bit of a depressive period I've been experiencing this weekend. I logged into my account and immediately began finding posts that I swear appeared in my feed months ago; all dated no more than 6 days ago. Some even posted a few hours prior. At first, I labeled it deja vu, but I scrolled further only to find several more posts fitting the same criteria. All of which I KNOW I have seen before, and not just in a surreal way -like deja vu- I mean, I had logged these posts before, liked them, sent one or two to my friends. It's as if I literally traveled back in time. To add to this, I also began experiencing detachment from reality. I began playing a couple of game apps on my phone to bring myself back, but the whole thing was sort of a blur. I've felt detached before, but never to this degree. It was like everything I knew was a lie. Strange ideas started popping into my head: the world is a bubble, I don't know what I am, am I a time traveler?, is it real? I can't be crazy, there's too much, something is wrong; upon all of this, I had a looming feeling of stress and anxiety.

Now, I've been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, but nothing very serious; I'm not crazy, I don't think.

It all ended in a big fight and I still think of him from time to time thinking it was all my fault and I could’ve done better. And lastly is the current one. He liked me for a long time and In the beginning I liked him back. But then he started to show that he had lots of problems with his mental health and slowly he would put them on me and I would crumble under the weight of his problems, my problems, and my friends problems. And I would lash out on him. I said some things I regret but he kept on liking me. Finally I convinced him to get a therapist right before I decided to distance myself....fast forward to a month ago when he said he got over me. I was so happy because he genuinely is an amazing person when he isn’t putting all of his problems on you and gets mad when you suggest he talks to a therapist or something like that. So I added him on social media and we started to talk again. A few days later I would be going to a different country to visit family and he would always be on his phone because he knows that I get bored easily and I would text him. It was great. But then I realized one week before I was supposed to come home from my visit, that he lied to me and he did like me. And I’ve had many problems with people lying to me so I get very mean/defensive and sensitive when it comes to someone lying to me. I told him that it wasn’t necessary and I didn’t want to talk to him at that point. I told him that maybe we weren’t good together whether it’s as friends or as a couple and that it would be best not to talk. And that was that. I came home and realized, “shit I messed up. I think I like him” he was mentally in a good place and I was trying (and still am) to find the courage to tell my family that I need a therapist and that I’ve hurt myself and many more things. And of course one of my friends started to like him. In the time it took me to stop talking to this boy and come back home from my visit which was around a week, they started to have a “thing” for each other. And that sucks. I was trying my best to see if he still liked me and maybe hint at it without being obvious or getting my friend mad at me. Because I don’t want to take him away from her. But I want him back too. And today was the deciding day. My friends went out to the movies with him and the girl without me which is fine because we aren’t even that close as friends anyway. And apparently they cuddled and he asked her out. And I am happy for them and I puke hate myself if o came between them but I am so incredibly mad with myself because I waited to long for something I didn’t know I wanted from the beginning. Not just that but I don’t have many friends. One of them left me because she started to try and imitate me and my new friends and she started vaping and doing things I wasn’t really into. And my best friend since third grade is moving halfway across the country. And everyone is always hanging out without me and it makes me feel lonely. Things like that and many more make me feel like I don’t deserve to be happy. So many crappy things have happened to me I genuinely believe that the universe or some god or whoever or whatever put us here wants me to not be happy. I don’t know where else to go. And I’m still afraid to tell my parents about me being depressed haha. We’ve had problems with other family members having anxiety and that resulted in many arguments and lots of screaming. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I know my problem isn’t important but I just want help. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",16Mar2019,2

So I have a weird mental issue that I need some advice on as well as to vent about.  I’ve been unhappy for most of my teenage life and every year of my 20s.  It stems to one thing.  I am wanting a relationship so bad.  

Please read everything. I hope it won’t be a long rant about my problems.  

Okay so long story short, I feel that I am mentally incapable of getting into a relationship with a girl.  I’ll explain the “why” in a second.  But because of this issue, I have never been on a date or anything like that.  

If it helps, I’m a 23 year old male.  

So here is the long story. 

I come from a religious family.  Since I was a pre teen, I was taught about girls, dating and all that sort of stuff.  I was also taught about hormones that would occur in my body what it would result to.  

But then this information mixed with something that wasn’t true at all.  I think it came from the knowledge that sex before marriage is a sin according to my beliefs.  Anyways, I felt it was appropriate if I totally shunned girls as a way to avoid any potential temptation altogether.  I would still talk to them if I absolutely had to, but I viewed them as people I shouldn’t talk to.  So through out my early teens I believed this. In my later teens, I believed it more.  I got to the point that even looking at a girl for longer then a second caused me guilt and shame.  So I quit the best I could.  

This guilt and shame probably always came from inside me.  One thing I would think was the fear of someone actually seeing me look at a girl, and negatively judging me for it.  Sounds stupid, I know.  I don’t blame you for thinking that.  I actually made a conscious effort to resist looking at girls completely.  If I ever did look at a girl, especially if our eyes met, then I would feel not only awkward but a degree of shame too.  I would not only avoid looking at their faces, but everything to do with them.  Body, cloths, shoes, you name it, i mentally blocked it all. 

Now fast forward to now.  I’m 23.  I don’t believe that girls are like that now.  So you may think that I’m cured and may ask “why are you writing this then?” Well this is the answer.  The actions have remained in my head. If I see a beautiful girl, I will not look at her, at all. I also will not even attempt to start up a conversation.  Typically, I will try to act like I don’t notice they are even around me.  I pretend to be oblivious and unaware they are there vs awkwardly looking or walking away. 

This being said, I have never been on a date or even texted a girl I like.  That alone is killing me inside.  

I’ve tried online dating.  It never works out.  My profile lasts about 2 days max and then gets deleted.  I ask myself, why would she like me? What abilities do I have to offer her.  What talents?  

Or even the other questions... like why aren’t there any religious girls around? And other questions stemming from this.  

So as you can see, I’m trying to some degree.  

This might be the most odd and weird post that anyone has read.  It might even be a first time.  For that, I’m sorry.  

If anyone has any meaningful feedback and not just “shut up and talk to her” by all means, please share.  I’ll be happy to give additional information.  I’ll also update this post if any other thoughts enter my head. ",16Mar2019,3

I'm so alone and i hate living like this.

I belong no where. 
No one wants me. 

I want to just dissapear so I dont have to deal with the world that will forget me.

I dont know any way out.
No matter what I do, nothing changes.

116,I find that I hit a lot of roadblocks in my ways of thinking which prevent me from taking action in different actions of my life. Would i benefit from CBT or another type best?,16Mar2019,1
117,My entire life ive had 0 ability to connect with people horrific anxiety around the ideas of sex and gender. When i was in the first grade my grandparents(whom i was raised by) had a counselor ask me if i had nightmares or trouble sleeping etc symtoms which i said i had trouble sleeping but not nightmares. I got kicked out of that school a few years later for a fight. But recently ive had a memory come back of a bunch of kids and some adult putting a girls hairpin in my head. Then my consciousness shoots out of my head and into the sky. Another memory of a teacher taking a kids clothes off and putting him in a diaper he can bearly walk in as he walked toward some guy idk who if his dad of what. That was a thought that ran thru my head at the time. Im seeing this from across the room or something. But basically i had this memory at the age of 21 im 22 now and my entire life ive never had any real friends relationships or passionate interests that would allow me to support myself. I got really good at basketball but anxiety of crowds and the ultimate fate that if i ended up on a hs team i would have to change in lockerrooms or potientally be close enough to any my teammates that they would ask me if i had a gf etc. I put off getting my license for years so i wuold have excuses to not hang out with people im so introverted. I moved around and lived in like 4 states growing up multiple houses each state. Idk where im going with this but basically i just talk to myself or debate god in my head 24/7 or zone out. Now i work at kroger a job where i talk to noone i have no friends no life at all. These two girls who i always would mark down mushrooms for them one day asked me if i wanted to hookup and i about started to cry i was so uncomfortable and scared. I honestly dont even remember what happend after that ik they apologized and said one more thing tho. I simply cannot function in life im so bored and with so much momentum of talking to myself i do it all the time now. I cant focus on anything. ,16Mar2019,3
118,"Sorry kinda new to posting to reddit, so bare with me. 

So a little backstory of my life with anxiety/depression: (23F) Since I can remember, I’ve been struggling with a lot of things mentally. My first recollection of a panic episode was when I was around 5 years old, still can remember it to this day. My grandmother, and mother have also struggled tremendously with anxiety throughout their lives, so my doc says it’s hereditary. Constantly on different medications trying to figure out ways to deal with these issues! My anxiety is constant. Constant stomach issues from it, constant worry/fear, it’s honestly terrible but I’ve learned to live with it. I’ve recently decided to ween off of Zoloft, and i’m struggling. (I’ve decided to go the medical cannabis route). Zoloft really messed up my stomach, and the negative symptoms from it just isn’t worth it for me. Also, I just don’t want to be on pills anymore..

Is there any way I can make this process of getting off these pills easier? I feel like my mind is going back to where it was and i’m pretty desperate to stay off the meds!! Thank you in advanced :) ",16Mar2019,1
119,"I have anxiety, depression and ADHD for a long time now, and something weird just happened, I always get bad anxiety in crowded areas and when I’m around other people, but never around my family unless it’s a large family gathering of over 40 people.

121,"I am kinda at a loss for how to help. My best friend has CPTSD and has been having a hard time lately. She will not consider reaching out for any help at all because when she was struggling a few years ago with suicidal thoughts she admitted herself and was sexually assaulted by a staff member. She has zero trust in any mental health professional and most doctors, understandably. She knows all of the technicalities to NOT be admitted, like she has told me she knows what to say to never go back to that place again. She thinks all *daily mental health medications are dangerous and addictive, although she will take a half of an ativan very occasionally when she is overwhelmed. She medicates with marjiuana, and it seems to usually help. This is where my problem comes in; its not helping right now. She goes through this weird funk every spring. Like clockwork and I dont know why. She wont say. She is just super depressed and her anxiety is through the roof.

So I feel like you guys/girls need to know my story with her, so if you can help then you got the info needed.

So when i was young (like 6-7 years) I fell in love with this girl Emma (not real name) and I've had that crush all the way till 8 grade (15-16 years) I said that i liked her and luckly enough she said the same to me. So we where together for a year'ish and then i fucked up, I ""fell in love"" with another girl at school, kissed the ""new"" girl WHILE i was together with Emma, she still love me after that, but I broke up with Emma because I though that i liked the other girl. 

Years go bye and i break up with my girl because i keep thinking about Emma. And now long after the break up did my brain break.
