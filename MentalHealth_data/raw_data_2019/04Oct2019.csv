1,"When I got to highschool I droped out because I was getting overly depressed by the ambient there with the pretext about it being not enough for me and having a low education level and then spent a year without doing barely anything other than sleeping and playing games.

I finaly went back to school last year and did fairly good but this year I'm barely showing up and sleeping all day. I believe that I'm setting myself for an awfull year trying to come back from this.

How can I stop this behavior? And overcome this?",04Oct2019,1

5,"Every time I go into Manhattan I'm instantly overwhelmed and panicking. Normally it's easier to hide away when my anxiety gets too much to handle, but not when you're in the city. To make the best of it I took videos that I thought captured what I was seeing and feeling that was making me so anxious. I hope someone can relate to this and know they're not alone, and that you're mental health matters and is valid.

8,"I made an appointment to see a Psychiatrist for the first time in my life due to the severe concentration issues I've experienced my whole life that has left me unemployed for the last 5 years.

I was completely honest with him about everything during our visits but left feeling skeptical both times if he actually believes me.

*FIRST VISIT*

-He got visibly annoyed and threatened to send me to therapy because I was displaying ""negative emotions"" for giving honest answers to his questions. The first question being why it took me so long to seek help and the second relating to Medicare. My answer to both of them was the fact that I was embarrassed to seek help and apply for Medicare. After the second time he got frustrated, I felt like I couldn't be truthful anymore if a question was asked and embarrassment was the answer.

-I made a light-hearted comment in which I was clearly being playful when I said ""Sometimes I hear people who are functional in their everyday lives say ""I'm so ADHD!"" but I don't think they understand how bad it really is."" in which he went on a minute long rant about how that's very judgmental of me.

-He demanded I bring a parent to the next visit despite being 30 years old or else he wouldn't refill the Adderall prescription he was about to prescribe me.

*SECOND VISIT*

-My mother and I showed up and were literally 2 minutes late from the scheduled appointment time due to her being sickly and not being ready on time. When we sat down in his office, he immediately told me how his other appointment had finished early and how I need to be responsible and be on time. My mother spoke up and said it was her fault. She didn't mention her not being ready on time but she did mention the fact that we got stuck behind a car (actually a bus) that caused us to be minutes late, which is true. He questioned her as to how would we get stuck behind a car, she said that she meant it was a bus and explained it to him. His demeanor appeared to me that he thought she was lying. Why would you question a sickly elderly person who's not even your patient?

-He asked me if I've noticed any changes with the Adderall (10MG) and I responded with ""To be honest, no."" and he said really snarky ""I would hope you're being honest, when people say that it makes me question what they're lying about."" He's smart enough to know what figure of speech is.",04Oct2019,1
9,So I guess it’s PTSD I just wanted to come here and ask like is that just an overarching term? I feel like PTSD can be so many different things.. I feel like most mental illness comes from past trauma so shouldn’t most people be diagnosed with PTSD? It just seems like a very broad diagnosis. Thx for any help I didn’t know where else to ask.,04Oct2019,1

I post this in hopes that it will reach out to many of those who suffer from chronic loneliness and depression.

This is, by far, the most vulnerable part of myself that I've ever shared publicly. But I feel almost compelled - because I am certain that I'm not the only one who's felt this way. 

I know that in sharing this - somebody, somewhere in this world who feels stuck in the pit of loneliness and the shame that's associated with it can realize that he/she isn't alone in this world after all. 

I sincerely hope this helps. 

Thanks.",04Oct2019,4
11,"I just noticed how dull my life actually is. 

I wake up around 6-6:30am each day.  I get up, wander around my room, find my clothes. I go downstairs, get my lunch in my bag and tell dad I’m ready to go. He turns the car on, I toss my stuff in the backseat and we go. I get to school around 7am. I either go to regulation drill, color guard, or talk with my boyfriend if he’s not at crack drill. 

I go to my classes. First hour economics honors, it’s boring I don’t talk to anyone because I get ignored and spoken over. I do my work and try to get through the class. I understand it but the tests mess me up. 
Second hour. Rotc, I sit and do my work as I’m told. I do the papers, then turn them in. On Wednesday’s our whole brigade (during that hour) gathers in the gym, we get in formation, do announcements and then disperse to wait for the bell to ring. 

Third hour, band. My favorite class. My friends are all here. Except my boyfriend. I play trumpet. I do my part as we practice for the field show tomorrow night. I look forward to it. Band is the one thing I think is keeping me from just giving up school activities all because of last years band director. 
Fourth hour. Chemistry. I try my best to understand. I talk to nobody except the teacher and maybe another classmate or two during labs. It’s mainly note taking on isotopes, and whatnot. It’s dull. I hate it. I do badly on tests anyways. 

Fifth hour is religion. I can sit there and do absolutely nothing the entire time. I can sleep, read a book or even browse the Internet if I want to. The teacher doesn’t notice and if I’m called on I just need to know the question and I will answer it. I know too much about religion and I feel as if this is all just being crammed down my throat just like middle school. 
Six hour. Algebra 2/trig. Teacher is chill. He has a gecko. She’s a good gecko but dislikes people and hasn’t been feeling well lately. I do my work most of the time and try my hardest to pay attention. It’s hard, I know what’s going on but I can’t focus and I feel sleepy. I do badly at tests in this class too. 

Seventh hour is AP English. We read pages in our books, write annotations and in class essays each week. It’s exhausting and I hate it. 

Day ends. I either go to d&amp;d club, wait till later that night for pep band/color guard, do homework or go home. I get home, do whatever homework I haven’t done and then get ready for tomorrow. I might watch tv if my parents aren’t hogging it. I rarely watch tv or want to play video games anymore. Most of the time I get tired by 9:30, go to sleep and then do it all over again. 

I have no close friends in school or in my classes. My best friend transferred schools and I don’t talk to her hardly ever. My middle school friends don’t invite me to anything, they don’t really talk to me even when I start talking. I don’t feel as if I can relate to anybody anymore. I talk to myself, always tap my foot to music that isn’t playing, whistle too much, click my tongue till people give me looks, I hide in my books, I am on my phone or staring off into space. I talk about my feelings too much towards my boyfriend and he doesn’t know how to fix me so he sets me down and walks away until I sort things out and feel better. It doesn’t sound like he’s doing the best thing but he is. I love him yet I feel like a burden to everyone. 

I can’t focus. Can’t get good grades. Everything is at a C. I don’t know what to do. Getting help doesn’t help. I don’t want to fail anything or I will absolutely hate myself, my parents will scream at me endlessly and my boyfriend will too. I stress myself too much and I don’t know what to do. 

I get depressed moods for no reason. There is no trigger to it. I feel anxious in large overcrowded, bright and noisy rooms. I can’t stand it to the point of needing to cover my ears. I sit and listen more than I include myself. There is something wrong with me. My mother refuses to see it. But I do. Something is up and I don’t know how to fix it. I want the emotions to stop. I want to stop feeling feelings. I hate them.",04Oct2019,3
12,"I'm wondering partly if this is just a 'me' problem, but how have some of you with ptsd or related struggles learned to actively reach out to people around you? I'm fairly young, and have been in therapy for years, and i think i partially trained myself to only really open up about my issues when in a therapy setting. i have people in my life like close friends or my boyfriend that want to help me if I'm in a bad spot, but i don't know how to make myself actually talk about stuff unless I'm directly asked. is this something many others struggle with? does anybody know something that may help someone begin to move past this sort of issue?",04Oct2019,1
13,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, NSFW and NSFL. 
I'm a 20yo girl, I suffer from severe BPD that causes me to have extreme self damaging behaviors among which self harm, drug abuse, nymphomania, etc. For most of my life I've been suicidal, I hate life and probably my only real wish is to be dead. I've tried to kill myself several times but I've always been very unlucky with that. 

So, the point of this is that beside the addiction to self harm (which I have pretty much under control right now), drugs and in general self destruction, I developed a very morbid addiction to gore and snuff porn. I've kind of had this ever since I had access to that part of the internet, but I feel like it got way worse after I got raped by someone really close to me one year ago. I am totally ashamed of it, I am so sorry to the whole world and to the victims of those videos for being part of the audience that keeps that market going, and I swear, I try really hard to keep myself from viewing that shit, but I just can't do it. 

I see myself in the victims, I have constant (to the point of viewing more times a day) fantasies about being abused, snuffed or brutally gored to death, it gives me a sense of peaceful bliss. A part of me thinks it's because I deserve that pain, and craves it as any other form of self destruction. Another part of me is just very amused by the idea of dying without even having to kill myself. And another part of me is massively turned on by putting my life in someone else's hands and have them decide what they want to do with me. 

I am aware of how sick this sounds, and I am seeking for help and going to therapy for my BPD, but I'm not quite ready to talk about this face to face with a therapist. I'm sorry if it sounds more like a rant than a proper question, I just need someone to tell me I'm not the only one with this sick fantasies, to tell me how they deal with them. I've tried researching but I can't really find anything I can relate to. Maybe you guys can help.",04Oct2019,4

16,"Lately (for the past 6 months or so) I've been having some weird thoughts, urges, and emotions, but before I discuss those, I want to give you some background first.

From a relatively young age (around 8), I've been depressed and had lots of suicidal thoughts. When I was around 12, I started having a better view of the world, but the suicidal thoughts never left me, so I just ignored them. I think it started around that age since I overheard my parents talking about moving to another country, and since I was closer to my cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents more than anything, I didn't let myself be happy until I knew I was staying. I really don't know. I'm a very conflicted person. I went to a therapist for a year when I was around 10, and when I was 11, we moved across the world. For the first year, I've been crying myself to sleep every night and had about 2-3 meltdowns but I learned how to cope with my situation.

But about 6 months ago, I've been having those urges and terrible thoughts to help people, but not in a very healthy way. For example, I wanted a car crash to happen, so that I can help the people in the car. When I was 7, before it all started, I remember wanting a burglar to break into our house, so that I can corner him in my room, and convince him to stop stealing, and become a better person. I asked my mum a long time ago about volunteering in hospitals, since she used to be a nurse, and used to volunteer, but she told me it also means seeing people die, and I'm not sure I'll be able to handle that. I'm ashamed of the thoughts in my head and I want it to stop. I've been thinking of cutting myself, but I know it won't help. Some depressed people feel empty, and say they would rather feel pain than nothing, but I'm not like that. I feel like something is pressing on my chest, painfully heavy fog in my head, the weight of the world on my shoulder.

I'm not sure if I'm mentally unstable, or if my therapist missed something that would've let to diagnosing all those years ago, but I don't want to stay like this.

Does anyone have any advice for me, or knows if this is maybe some kind of mental illness?

I would rather not disclose any personal information, but if it would help...

17,"So it seems like this is mostly stress or trauma based, it started happening after she was going through a break up and her and her boyfriend (let's call him John) had connected google and verizon accounts. I don't know exactly what happened but he may have changed some passwords or was monitoring her messages. Before they broke up there was evidence that he was trying to hide some of his own info from her (YouTube history of how to hide phone messages etc.) so possibly this is what made her think he was capable of ""hacking"" or whatever.

John is an idiot, he is not capable of doing anything serious. I also only know her side of things, so there is the odd possibility that she was planting all of these things about him, I honestly cannot tell.

Anyways, she is then in another relationship but there is still drama with John going on. He is showing up at the house unanounced to try to get his things, getting drunk and harassing her, etc. This is when she starts to get paranoid in general just being unsure of when he will show up or if she'll see him in public. She ended up succesfully getting a restraining order against him, awesome. But before that situation was resolved, she becomes convinced that this other guy she is seeing is bugging her phone and computer. She thought that an astrology app on her phone was actually some kind of data recorder, she even had a friend of hers that worked at verizon tell her this was true. I looked into it, and there's just no way it's true, it's a normal ass astrology app.

They end up breaking up, I'm pretty sure the guy did admit to looking through her messages or something I'm not really sure. He was really sketchy in general and was going through some other legal stuff. He was also younger and seemed more tech savvy so I wouldn't be surprised if he did a little bit of snooping.

So since all of this she has been constantly paranoid and convinced her phone and any technology is always hacked. She even got a new phone and changes her google password constantly (I am her back up email so I get notifications for it).

She also had her card info stolen multiple times (small charges that were resolved), which I think contributes to her paranoia, but she's either not careful with online purchases or there's just some assholes in our small town installing card scanners at gas stations. It's not something I am concerned about.

She asked me the other day if I had put a marker on her house on the GPS of my car I recently sold to her, I told her I don't remember doing that but that it is impossible for it to be hacked, the maps are based from a CD in the car and does not connect to the internet. The other guy was driving the car for a while so she is scared he is tracking her location since he had said something about wanting to update the GPS when they were still dating.

My Mom is not old, she is only in her early 40's. However, I have always suspected that she is a manipulative narcissist. My whole life she has always jumped from guy to guy based on how much they can provide for her. I have always thought that she plays victim to get out of most of these relationships and to get out of other situations in life. When confronted, she gets a glazed look in her face and has no idea what you're talking about. I think that she must dissociate from her real self or something idk it's very strange. A large majority of her relationships have ended with the guy having a mental breakdown and going off the deep end.

All of that being said, I am very worried about her. She is really in a bad spot and I moved hours away from her recently and I can't check on her physically. She has no family in town anymore.

My friend that sees her often told me that Mom thinks her new house is bugged with cameras, so that is why I am seeking advice.

If this paranoia isn't early dementia or some other similar problem, I want to know how I can pull her out of this since it just started within the last year. Because of the above mentioned narcissism, my siblings and I have distanced ourselves from her. I barely talk to her, only a text every other week. I think that I should probably talk to her more often and ask her details about her life, so she knows she has someone there for her.

Dementia or schizophrenia or Alzheimer's or anything of that nature does not run in our family.

Other than that, what are more serious signs that I should look out for and what would be cause to get the proper services involved?",04Oct2019,1

One of my current classes deals with life after graduation, and all of that makes me extremely anxious. I have so much going on this semester that the thought of next May and beyond is too much for me right now. 

This week hasn’t been the best, I’ve cried most everyday and at night I lie in bed unable to sleep because my mind is too focused on what I need to get done. 

I’ve never been good at concealing my emotions, and apparently I’ve been letting them slip through too much in my major classes because two of my professors want to have a meeting with me about my mental health. 

This stresses me out to no end and has only made the physical aspects of my mental health worse (when I get too upset I can’t eat, my stomach gets so tight I feel like I’m constantly going to throw up). 

I expressed that the thought of this made me anxious and I apologized for how I’ve been, but they’re insistent on meeting with me. I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to talk to them about my true feelings and problems, but I probably can’t get out of this meeting.

However I feel really off today, and it's becoming hard to do really basic tasks. For example, today I did a 4K run for my high school's Cross Country team. Taking a shower just felt exactly like doing another 4K run.

I'm a Sophomore in a Catholic school (altho I don't really participate in the religious ceremonies personally.) I work on music, and every moment that I'm not working on my music I feel genuine mental pain and like I can't focus on anything. It's not like I just am addicted and *want* to do music, it's also just that I feel like in order to do what I want to do when I'm older I need to spend every second of my life working on it and it kills me. I'm also suffering from lots of loneliness feelings and despair in classes, and the slightest thing someone says or does to me can make me feel depressed and unable to work for the rest of the day. Often when I'm at school though, I don't feel happy or sad, like my emotions are being constantly compressed and I just feel nothing but literally *nothing.* Usually to have a good day only positive things can happen, to have a bad day literally anything else that's tiny and insignificant (ex. someone ignoring me, someone looking at me weird, etc.) and I'm ruined.

For example, when my mom comes in my bedroom I hide my phone, flip over my homework, and turn my music off/hang up on the call I was on. It’s honestly just a reflex most of the time. When my dad asked to see my phone, I froze and refused to give it to him because I was scared he was going to look through it. 

When I lost my goggles that I use for field hockey, I never told my mother until she found out and said I made her look bad because I didn’t wear the goggles because I didn’t want her to spend money on me. I hate when she spends money on me, I feel terrible and I feel like I have to repay her but I can’t, because I’m only a kid.

I’m an A and B student, and my parents think I’m smart, but they do know I can be a bit lazy sometimes. I don’t ask for anything from my parents, they usually are the ones to ask if I need anything for school, sports, etc. The only thing I want from them is that they let me play videogames on weekdays, because videogames make me feel so calm. I also have lied to my parents many times about losing things, because I don’t want them to think I’m a fuck up.

What do I have to hide on my phone? Well, I’m in a lot of discord servers that have people that curse (including myself), I have kind of a sketchy camera roll with many inappropriate jokes but that’s kind of it.

Why am I saying all of this? I want to know why I feel the need to be so private, and what I can do to let my parents trust me more.  This is eating away at my brain, I feel like a social outcast because of how much I lie to my parents and I feel like they hate me for it.",04Oct2019,2

Started to use drugs, which really makes me feel guilty. I have been sleeping for 10 to 12 hours a day, walking up still tired even preparing a meal, or working out seems like a burden.
Any tips on how to cope would be appreciated

33,"Is it normal to not think of other people really as people, and more like actors in your life? Like I understand people are individuals, but I can’t relate to them at all or feel like they’re anything more than an npc in my world.",04Oct2019,1
34,"So I need some help. For I long time ive had this feeling being worthless and that my emotions are too much for anyone to handle, which I think is something that everyone feels at some point. But its only in recent years that its become something that really needs to be addressed. Full blown melt downs have become daily if not every other day. Thoughts about how I will never be loved and that all always be second place to everyone in my life and that if I don't hide my emotions and thoughts that ill only scare anyone who wants to get close away. Its made me a hideously jealous person because I always feel threatened by anyone else in the people who I care about lives, and if Im not careful I feel that I will make me become controlling and manipulative. I dont want to become that way but I really just dont know what to do and I need some outside advice. This is my first ever post and I dont know if I'm acting totally within the correct social norm here but im getting a bit desperate for some kind of different perspective. 

Thanks and sorry if im annoying",04Oct2019,1
35,"I have this issue where I feel so lonely and isolated and desperate for meaningful connections with others, but I can't bring myself to actively try and make friends or invest in my very few existing friendships because I have this deeply held belief that I'm a bad person and I'm doing other people a favour by keeping my distance. Beyond that, I also have severe abandonment issues so I'm scared that even if were able to overcome this and make some close connections with people I'll just end up losing them.  

I've been talking to my counsellor about this and she's been trying to encourage me to challenge my negative self talk and take the risk of making and maintaining friendships, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in the beliefs I hold about myself.

Has anyone else had a similar experience and managed to overcome it? I'm just feeling really stuck and unable to move beyond this point despite engaging with counselling.",04Oct2019,2
36,"I've been in a really bad place this past month. So many bad things have been happening to me day after day. Things just keep getting worse, one bad things after another type situation. Close bonds I have are falling apart, there's a lot of family issues going on, and I've been so depressed. All these things happening have made me become irritable, cynical, defensive, and cause me to be snappy with my friends, which only makes the situation worse.

 I'm hoping to see a therapist soon but I still feel like shit. I feel like this is the worst I've felt in years, possibly my whole life. I end up being depressed for days on end, 24/7. I'll randomly start breaking down in the middle of my classes because I can't help but think about the situation I'm in. I've gone through rough patches, but I feel so hopeless. I know it'll get better but it doesn't feel like it will. Hopefully somebody gets what I mean.",04Oct2019,1
37,"I don’t have motivation in life. Nothing moves me, I don’t have friends anymore, I don’t have a hobby that my parents haven’t taken away, I have no drive to improve, and I don’t know why I’m alive. Why can’t I fix myself? Why can’t I try and get more friends, pick up new hobbies, why can’t I study and try to improve on the math test tomorrow? I see the problems every day, every time there’s something coming towards me like a deadline or a problem, and I just fuck up my potential and just sit there like a statue. I hate myself for it and I want to change but I don’t know how. In all honesty I’m posting here as a last chance for myself  because I almost drove off the highway to end it all.

41,"Hi - male, 35 here. Expat living in Los Angeles for more than 5 years now. Looking for advice on how to fucking get moving towards the positive behavior I need. Really struggling with getting back even to a normal functioning for a week of work right now as well as actually moving forward with making positive changes in my life. Thanks for reading and possibly replying. 

 

Current Situation

* I have called out sick from work for a week and I have not done anything at all during these days (except for writing this now, on day 4) 
* I have turned off the notifications of my main messaging app now for a week to avoid contact by my family and friends; I haven't read messages for about a week

Substance abuse

* I ""manage"" my emotions by consuming weed
* I smoke weed every day and have been for a year+ (and almost daily for much longer) 
* It causes me to eat badly, to be lethargic, to not be social, have less energy 
* I know weed is much of the core issue, but I don't seem to be able to control my consumption
* For long, it has helped me as a means of winding down and attempting to disconnect from work 

Food

* I overeat on fast food 3-5 times a week
* I rarely work out now; only go for walks 
* I eat some healthy food

Behavioral challenges 

* I feel paralyzed about actively creating / shaping my life 
* I am shy of interpersonal conflict which leads to unresolved frustrations
* I procrastinate extremely (expense reports from over half a year ago, for instance)
* I actively avoid engaging in uncomfortable tasks and activities that would help me feel better once completed; I smoke weed instead and try to push it away

Social life, friends &amp; family 

* I feel alone
* I do not engage socially on almost any weekend and spend them home by myself
* I do not frequently speak with my friends and family from home
* I avoid talking to my parents because I do not want to lie to them, but I am also worried about talking to them about my problems
* I currently do not communicate with my family (silence for 3 weeks now) even though I know it worries my mother
* I do not have many real friends at all in LA; and no long-standing or really very active friendships; all my people of trust are on another continent
* I've been on just one date since I broke up with my girlfriend 8 months ago (2.5 year relationship, ended not messy between us, but hit me hard still)
* I rarely ever go out to do stuff and if so it's usually not socially interactive (movie, sit down concert, stand-up comedy) and half the time I do it alone
* I do not feel attractive to women as I am quite overweight now
* I feel like I lack social interaction skills nowadays 
* I don't feel like I have a real person of trust around me locally; I do have two people I consider my friends, but they don't have the emotional maturity to help me or have their own shit going on 
* I don't talk to anyone about my problems
* It feels that my life (including my job) mainly happens in front of and through screens, so much less through real people and places and interactions

Job 

* I feel like my job is **always** on my mind; it is never done; I never disconnect (I work in a production/event agency-related role) 
* I feel like my job is always stressful 
* I worry about my career with admitting about mental health issues
* I do not really/fully trust that my workplace will back me up
* For about half a year now there’s been also a major challenge with a new co-worker; a conflict that I’ve been unable to resolve (also right back to avoiding interpersonal conflict) that has caused me a great deal of distress 

Well being 

* I wake up nauseous every morning; have been for weeks; almost every morning I'm over the toilet heaving and retching 
* For a long time, I have justified my apathy and lethargy towards actively creating my life outside of work with the time and energy spent on my work and putting that first 
* As soon as I wake up, negative things dominate my mind and seem overwhelming
* As soon as I wake up, I feel that it's a race to the emails and meetings to try and catch up or get ahead
* I have experienced weeks/days like this before, about 1-2 times a year for the past 3 years (including long stretches of nausea) 

Solutions

* On a smaller level writing list of accomplishments on daily basis helps, but I don't do it consistently
* I don't engage in any positive behavior consistently, only in negative 
* I see some of the short-term solutions for a happier life (just quit the weed, work out regularly, call your mom and eat right), but I feel that I don't have the drive, will power, discipline, energy or motivation to actually make the changes; also work-sided situation may be harder to solve due to lack of direct control
* Talking to friends and family about my problem again and more openly, respectively, of course too, but find it very challenging
* I don't want to tell people because of pride, and not wanting to be a burden on them; I think I also fear of what a long-term implication may be in my relationships with some people 
* Another reason why I don't want to admit weakness is because I have always been someone who has accomplished things (at least in my mind); it does not fit with my usual self image of myself (though I do see that my current state of being is rather pathetic)

Health Care 

* I have not seen a doctor about this yet; only time I went to an urgent care feeling similar a year or two ago they gave me some pills and told me I could go back to work; though I've done a tiny bit of research on therapy (I have insurance, but I don't even have a PCP right now) 
* I am not actually knowledgeable, but I am afraid of the complexity and to an extent potential costs of some sort of treatment; I am also worried about some sort of long-term record or label in the system re substance abuse or mental health 
* Plus, of course, procrastination and weed 

Personal Goals

* I haven’t set, chased or fulfilled personal goals in a long time it seems 

Questions / Short-term goals 

* How do I beat my weed addictions and habits? 
* How do I make sure I eat right? 
* How do I ensure I work out at least 2-3 times a week? 
* How do I not let my administrative chores slip? 
* How do I manage my work-related stress and balance with my personal life? 
* How do I communicate more openly and frequently with my friends and family? 
* What do I do about work? 

I think it all starts with the weed, to be honest.",04Oct2019,1
42,"I’m 17, and I’ve done almost every drug you can name, where it’d almost be easier to list which ones I haven’t done. I no longer do any kind of substance. I avoid caffeine as well. 

Anyways, I know that I might be predisposed to bipolar disorder, because my mom has it, and after doing LSD and developing depersonalization, I’m afraid that I’ll end up developing schizophrenia or psychosis. I’m terrified of this, which is the reason I quit doing drugs. I also smoked weed everyday for about a year. 

I’m afraid I might’ve ruined my life. I have terrible brain fog and depression now, and I have crazy random mood swings. I’ll be sitting in class and I’ll randomly feel this wave of dread fall over me, and it always freaks me out. Idk why this happens. 

Am I screwed?

Please don’t give me lectures on how I’m stupid. I already know I am, but what’s done is done, and I’d like some reassurance, or at least be able to hear what someone else has to say about this. :)",04Oct2019,1
43,"He constantly goes and buys scratch offs and lottery tickets in addition to be being a huge germaphobe.

He tells me that there's nothing wrong with him, but I'm pretty sure that's a lie or he's in complete denial.. What can I do in order to possibly get him to seek help.

44,"For about a year now I've felt so hopeless, but I was able to keep contained in myself or at least within the confines of my room. I'd sometimes go to sleep crying or pace anxiously around my room until I could finally fall asleep. I was able to keep all that to myself and hidden away from my friends and things seemed good and happy, I'd sometimes get done with hanging out with them and go into my room and cry because I always afterwards felt like that was going to be the last time that would get to hang out with them. Everything was good at least they thought I was fine, minus the occasional bouts of irritability I'd have. But at some point in the past 7 months something happened I don't know what exactly but since around March I've felt like I've been falling apart. Through out March to June I'd sometime drive around aimlessly just so I could cry without fear of my room mates hearing me cry as well as a way to try and get my mind off whats going on in my head. That all kinda came crashing down near the tail end of July when I left work early one day because I was there all by myself for several hours and I couldn't really take it any longer, when I got home one of my room mates noticed and asked me if everything was okay. I couldn't keep myself together any longer and I just started crying, they hugged me and tried to comfort me. Since then I've been having a hard time keeping all my sadness contained I've tried to keep it all to myself but I've also been more irritable lately and kinda of mean to my friends unintentionally (hopefully at least). I've told them I'm sorry several times, but I feel like my friends have been more distant to me. I just don't know I hate that I'm like this, I've gone to counseling several times now, I always feel great afterwards but the day after It's like I go from flying high in the clouds, to I all of a sudden crash and hit the ground and then I get really upset that I so quickly went from feeling happy and hopeful back to feeling sad and hopeless. And these sudden shifts in how I feel I think frustrate my friends since one day I can be fine the next suicidal. I just feel so lonely and hopeless, and If I lost my friends  I'd probably give up on life. I just feel like I'm not really in control anymore, I just feel like I'm falling apart and every time I start feeling better I get so hopeful, then suddenly I start to fall apart again, It's just so frustrating for me and the people I care about.",04Oct2019,1

54,"have crazy anxiety recently I think my brain is getting exhausted after 3 weeks of it and I’ve fallen back into depression now. It’s been three days of like... no motivation at school, not getting out of bed, and a crummy irritated and sad mood. Anyways today I finally got out of bed arnd 3 pm and decided to shower and then I started to do art and write ideas for some cool pieces I could do, so I was very excited bc I haven’t been doing a lot of art recently and I got motivated. It was great and I was happy and listening to music in my headphones. So after a bit I started to dance around my room and have fun and then I turned my head and my mom was staring at me at the door. I paused my music so fast and played it off as a joke like ‘mom! I’m dancing! Hahaha’ but near the end of the interaction I became humiliated and cried in the bathroom after. I was so upset that I was letting the fun be ruined by something so humiliating yet small... I wish I would’ve shrugged it off and kept dancing after but it was one of those days where it’s been building up over time I guess and I just started bawling over the stupidest thing 😐 I literally could’ve been like “oh that wasn’t embarrassing. Let’s continue” and continued dancing? But no I had to cry and ruin the whole situation lol 


Hey but on the plus side, I did prove to myself thay I could get out of bed and just get ready. I had also made my own breakfast in the morning (like bacon and English muffin!)  and had a shower once I got up. I always do this thing where when I’m depressed and laying in bed where I like.. put my phone down and say “ok. Just fucking get up now.” So I rip the blankets off and just force myself up. It reminds me I have control over my body even when I don’t have control over my emotions/depression.

I work night-shifts for almost 2 years now, so its rare for me to sleep at night. I dont see anything if im not trying to sleep. I do see them however, regardless of my eyes being opened or closed. 

I dont feel any emotions. Its like a movie that u've seen hundreds of times. Its there, IT looks creepy, but whatever, doesnt make you feel anything.

I dont have any problems sleeping, im making 7h sleep usually 8am-3pm every day except weekends when i sleep however long j want.

Now, the images are not static, but they are not super vivid. They are detailed, but not vivid. They look like... A snow vision's after image merged with other after image and created a form / shape that them become detailed.

56,"I'm in a situation where I feel like I'm just existing, not really achieving anything in everyday life, in terms of a career, in terms of my relationships etc.

12 months ago, I was in the best shape of my life. I had a pretty healthy thing going with food and exercise, but now I'm not fit at all, put on a lot of weight. I love exercising and eating properly, but I just refuse to. At work, I feel like I'm overachieving and that I'm ready for a new challenge, task, position, yet at the same time I'll put something off until it's too late. I feel like it's normal to just rather not be doing something, and I know what that feels like - and that's how I know this is not just that. There's a difference between procrastination and just absolutely refusing to do a task and having severe fear about doing it.

I feel like there's two people fighting in my head, ones fit and does really well at his job, keeps up with his hobbies, the other can just do nothing and be happy, and I feel like the other is winning.

58,"
I may be dealing with someone dangerous in my life, and it's making me feel almost insane. I need some advise. Whether its narcissism, antisocial personality disorder, or something else, I cannot yet decipher, but I know something is wrong with this person. This is a long post, so bare with me.

Let me describe myself first. I am a six foot six, 31 year old man, who takes excellent care of myself. Clean diet. Good hygiene. Physical job. My wife and I have had a very solid relationship for the last 11 years. Sure, we've had our moments of issue, but in all, things have been well. She has been the center of my world since the beginning of our relationship. But, for the last few years, she has not been taking the best care of herself. Poor hygiene. Weight gain. And she has been using social media as a crutch since her best friend moved out of state. We have not had proper sex in over a year. Yet, I've still been fully invested. We own a house and are planning to have kids in the future.
A few months back, I changed jobs for better money. The staff was/is for the most part very professional, as well as the way the company is run. I remember the day I met her, this woman who worked up front. I had completed my training, when they ask me if I had met her yet. Lets call her J. I said, hello, but I noticed something odd. The moment she looked at me she grinned widely, and shook her head slowly, while fixing her posture. She was tall, skinny, dark skin/hair, and clearly took very good care of herself. But, I didn't think twice about it. I just turned around and walked straight to my car. She either thinks your cute, or shes just really friendly, I told myself. That was the extent of it. 
I began working there in June. I spoke minimally to everyone, and though I'm very sarcastic as a person (and was very much so with everyone at my last job after a few years), I kept it under wrap. This was a new environment. I couldn't afford to mess up. But, somehow J knew, and began sharing her sarcastic side with me. She told me that she read it in my expression when we first met. She still frequently mentions the moment we first met. 
So, we started getting friendly. We work closing shifts on mondays, just me and her, until 9/9:30, so I figured it was natural. I work in a female dominated industry, and I often am quite friendly with the receptionists. A few have even become some of my best friends, whom I still see weekly. 
Soon, the jokes got funnier, and I found it thrilling to be in her presence. Then one night, she started asking personal questions, about myself, and my wife; about my home situation, and my career. In the middle of the the conversation, she mentioned I was attractive. I thought nothing of it. I've had many female friends and coworkers compliment my appearance. No problem. 

But, then things started getting a bit strange. I was up front the following week, looking at take home products, when I felt a pair of eyes on my back. I turn, and J is staring at me, grinning hugely, yet somehow beautifully. Our eyes met, and her position did not change. The eye contact was intense, and I didn't know how I felt. She probably really thinks your cute, I told myself. Oh well, she'll have to deal with the fact that I'm married. From that day forth, whenever I'm up front, she watches me. Sometimes we make eye contact, and she grins and looks into my eyes intently.
But thats not all. While things at home continued getting worse, J continued to ask me questions. Our conversations began getting deeper, and she continued to pry me for questions. In her voice she sounded genuinely interested and caring, even to the point where your could hear in her voice how much she cared. Day by day, I started to realize how much we had in common; health and wellness, simular taste in movies, simular life experiences. Whenever we spoke deeply, and she had to leave to room she would, softly and sweetly say, ""goodby."" 
Then it hit me like a train wreck one day, when she walked by me, giving me her puppy eyed look, and pouting slightly; I had feelings for her. After all this time gearing toward a life with my wife, someone I held dear to my heart and soul, this new woman had threatened everything. I began noticing how attractive she was. To her, I was the funny guy, the interesting guy, the tall good looking guy. I found myself working on my appearance more than ever. J, a woman I would have barely noticed if we had passed on the street, was suddenly one of the most beautiful people I'd ever seen, or met. 
In the following days, she was speaking with me in the break room , when our eyes met. She continued speaking, but I couldn't follow. The eye contact felt so deep and intimate, that it was almost surreal, that moment. Her eyes were more widened than usual, and I was surprised how long we held contact. We looked away at the same time. I felt my heart flutter like a fool in love. Yet, I felt alive inside, as if there was a hint of nostalgia between us. Don't be an idiot I said to myself, this is a professional environment, and I'm a taken man. Prevent these feeling because nothing will ever come of them. So I tried.
Things at home started to heat up after that. I began criticizing my wife on everything, from her appearance to her social media usage, so much that we have ended up in marriage counseling. We are not sure if we're even going to make it at this time. I sure hope we do.
In the meantime, J started speaking to me more sexually. I was up front one night when she asked me if I ever had a beard. I explained that my wife did not like it, and it was more a gotee than a beard that I grew. I described it. She then said, ""I'd do you in that."" I think I must have blushed. That day, she also down talked other men and spoke highly of me.
Then the next week she came in dressed very skimpy, as if she were dressed to go to a night club. That was the first time I checked her out. It felt wrong. That day she asked me to hold the office door open for her. I took the lead and went inside. She followed, and the door closed behind us. Once we were inside together, she said, ""you've finally got me trapped in a dark room alone with you."" She grinned. I was quite shocked at that moment. I've had females come on to me in the past like that, but none of them I'd thought about twice. But it was like she had some sort of power over me. I stepped out uncomfortably  and we laughed. 
I couldn't get my mind off her that week. I waited to see her again. But then I realized something, J knew a whole lot about me, but I knew little about her. Thats when I began asking around. Only one other person knew anything about her. Apparently, she is engaged, and has a full time gig as a dental assistant. I was surprised. 
Last Sunday, I came in, and she was standing up front with two other receptionists. Instead of just focusing on her like she's used to I said hello to all three of them, like any professional should. Through my side vision I could see her staring at me as I walked passed. Later I went up front and spoke to another receptionist about my client running late. J said my name excitedly and I looked at her. ""I've got something for you,"" she said, playfully. ""Ok,"" I responded. ""Turn around,"" she said. I did so. ""Okay, I'm ready."" I then realized I had forgotten that I'd let her borrow a movie of mine the month before. She posed in a cute way, and acted like she were doing me a favor by giving me it back. I asked if she'd watched it. She said she did. I then asked if she watched it the previous night. She said she did. However , she had nothing to say about it, and when I brought up certain scenes, she just nodded and agreed with whatever I said, not adding anything to the conversation. I took it to the back and waited for my client, who was at this point very late. Soon, I went up front and spoke with the other receptionist. J said my name, practically interrupting us. I was beginning to suspect something was very wrong. Even the other receptionist gave her a weird look.
We met her in the hall later. She just kept grinning. There was something malevolent about that grin. Something not genuine. I'd noticed she was working only two days at this point and I asked if she was planning on leaving since she found a higher paying job. She looked at me in the eyes and said, ""no,"" then grinned again, wider than ever, and said ""unless you tell me you don't like me anymore.""
That was the last time I saw her. But, I will most definitely see her again. I know something is wrong and things are getting worse. Stonewalling her makes her come in even stronger, and she  an easily reel me back, as if my willpower is broken in her presence. There have been many other incidents, but these are just some good examples. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm exaggerating some of these encounters, wondering if her intent is not what I'm thinking. But, my memories are clear as day. The way she watches me constantly should be proof enough that something is off.
As I try and pick up the pieces at home, I don't go a day now without thinking of J, and wondering if we really have a connection, or more likely, if I am being manipulated. If anything, I know this behavior is far from normal. She also has a fascination with men in vampire shows, whom which she seems to be comparing me to. This is nothing new for people, even though I hate it lol. Perhaps she is having narcissistic fantasies of me. I cannot tell. All I know is she loves to talk to me about vampires, and has joked that she thinks I secretly am one.

59,"Don't believe me? See what happens when you decide to try to stop taking them. I bet most of you would go into a horrible state of withdrawal worse than you initially felt before you started taking the drugs. 

Most people need to taper off of them over at least 9-18 months to get off of these drugs safely.

60,"Hello.

I'm just hear to type this out as I feel I can't approach anyone with this for fear of judgement.

I'm currently going through the lowest point i've ever been at in my life. I just returned to work this week after being signed off for 3 months with severe depression. I wasn't ready to return, but I absolutely had to due to lack of money and an ever increasing level of debt.

2 days ago, I received some news that has absolutely crippled me. I'm frozen with fear and dread, I have never felt this low in my life.

A girl whom I'd slept with after a night out told me she is pregnant and that it is 100% mine. We used protection, all I can think is it ripped.

Anyway, she has already told me that she will be keeping this child and that either I step up and be a dad, or she will milk me for every penny I have, which is next to none.

I genuinely am distraught with what to do, I'm in no position to be able to support or care for a child, I can barely keep myself afloat. I don't know what to do, where to turn. I feel completely lost and swamped by all of this.

I don't want children, I don't want the responsibility, I don't feel I can give a child the life they deserve. I have no money, I'm not in a relationship with this girl, I have nothing to give.

3 years ago I was at the happiest I have ever been, work was going well, I had money, I had a fantastic car, good prospects. Fast forward to now and it's an entirely different life, I'm trying so hard to fight and rebuild myself, make it back to the right path, how on earth am I going to get there now?

Thanks for reading through my venting, I just thought it may help.",04Oct2019,2

68,"I think I had a ""depressive episode"" last night and I'd like to ask opinions if this is cause for concern (am I prone to depression) or is it a normal funk people sometimes get into.

So, I consider myself a neurotic/anxious person but anxiety has never impeded me from going about my business. I worry a lot, I get emotional and agitated easily. I am kind of jumpy, I often jump to the worst possible conclusion. I get down on myself occasionally but never so down that I don't want to leave the house for instance.

All within normal limits I would say. 

At the moment, I am having kind of a rough week: swamped at work + bad family stuff. 

Last night when I got home, I was kind of down, I wasn't really in a talkative mood. Usually when I get like that, my SO tries to talk to me, cheer me up. But the more he tried to engage with me the more my thoughts bacame muddy, like I could not think of a solution or a joke (my go-to trick when I am nervous). 

I shut down. At around 9 PM I crawled into bed, unusually early for me. While lying in bed I didn't want to do anything, I didn't want to think or feel anything. I just wanted it to be morning so I can get dressed, go to work, fall into the comfort of my regular routine.

When I thought about regular evening activities like gaming with my SO or watching Netflix or even eating (I skipped dinner) I just could not fathom mustering up enough energy/willpower to do any of it. My SO started watching some stand-up show, and usually I love stand-up, but last night I hated the sound of people laughing in the background, I felt like there was an intruder in my house when all I wanted was to be left alone. 

Following day, got up, went to work. I am not my normal cheery self but I guess I am ok. I am overanalyzing the previous evening I am sure but I've never felt so... numb. Worse yet, I could not imagine a way out.  I don't think I've ever shut down like that, not from my memory.",04Oct2019,1
69,"Hey everyone,

Roughly 2 and a half years ago I suffered a really traumatic experience, which caused me to withdraw myself from friends and family. I had a super big friend group, was extremely social and played high level sport and it all started crumbling. This momentum led into the summer holidays in which I went out roughly 5 times over the whole 2 months and felt completely trapped and depressed. The next year I was slowly getting things back in shape, but decided to stop playing rugby completely as for some reason I completely stopped enjoying it. Stuff was going alright for me until the summer holidays came and I trapped myself inside where every single day I would wake up not wanting to leave the bed, feeling nothing but a deep sadness almost every day. It felt like I lost myself completely; once this super social and happy jock, now just this depressed and anxious version of myself.

This year however, I have built myself up again but with summer approaching shortly I’m feeling depressed again already. I’m fearing the 2 months of break and all the feelings are already flowing back in. How can I fix this? Or at least cope with it? I’ve decided that I can’t just sit around and do nothing about it like usual and I need to do something about it right now to ensure I break this cycle once and for all.

I’ve learned to wear it like a cloak in the past 15 years. I am genuinely curious if everyone else around me feels this way too. I’ve seen a lot of therapists in the past months and was diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder, depression... I cope with it the absolute best I can with coffee, cigarettes (read: nicotine), exercise, and my mood can improve but always returns to desolation. 

I’m healthy, exercise often, eat generally healthily, get adequate sleep (with the much needed help of meds...). I make friends pretty easily, I’ve had plenty of relationships, I really can’t pinpoint what it is. It’s my norm. I’m on an SSRI now, an atypical antidepressant (sleep), an atypical antipsychotic (sleep), have tried various antidepressants... have been on benzodiazepines. I’m pretty well-versed in psychology.

It gives me temporary pleasure just like any other addiction. 

Do you find yourself constantly in relationships where you're trying to fix someone else? I know I have and I now know this is a way to distract myself from the fact that I need to fix my own self. If this resonates with you then start to do the work to look within. We all have wounds. We will never heal these wounds with anything outside of ourselves. After I help someone else I am eventually left feeling empty inside because I'm not doing the work to help myself. We cannot help or care for anyone else if we are not helping and caring for ourselves first.

I eventually pushed her away, and my dumbass started hitting up another girl, and she caught me... We were technically broken up after that, but she was still living at my house with me the rest of my family, and she was still sleeping in my bed with me, and we would still occasionally have sex here and there and still hangout with each other every day. This went on for about a month. And then eventually she told me that in spite of me and out of anger of what I did to her, she had made out with my brother, and so I got extremely mad, shoved her to the ground, and kicked her out of my house and then that was the end of us. I moved into my sisters house for a few months to get away from my brother, whom I stupidly eventually forgave because he played the victim card stating that she manipulated him and he was ""in a rough place in his life"" so he was ""easily manipulated"".

86,"I'm a 19 (M), I just started my second year of University and my life is in a shambles right now. I have always had low self esteem due to a rough childhood and bad parenting; I would spend the majority of my childhood playing video games with minimal social interactions, thus developing my social anxiety. 

My social life eventually started getting better as I turned 16, where I was in my last year of secondary school, I had just taken off my braces, and I started getting my haircut in the barbers. During this time, I had many close friends, I was doing excellent in school, I was also getting a lot of female attention and I started going out almost everyday with my friends . The truth is that although I was developing my social skills during that period, I would intentionally avoid engaging in any intimate relationships, using studies as an excuse, whereas in reality I was just scared of talking to girls. 


After this period, my life started going downhill. In the UK, after you finish secondary school, students get a 3 month holiday period before they start their A-levels. During this time, all my friends went on holiday's with their family, whilst I reverted to my old habits of staying indoors and playing video games. During these 3 months, what I would classify as one of the main reasons of my depression occurred. Hairloss. By the end of the Summer holiday my hairline had significantly receded, and to make matters even worse, my hair started balding aswell. I had lost all the confidence I had gained over the past year in no time. My hair was my defining feature, which made up for other shortcomings such as my height (5'3) and my facial features. 


I fell into a period of depression during my A levels, as my hair was continuously getting worse, in addition to this I had to deal with family issues (you can read my other post if you want) . Along with my friend group at the time who were incredibly bad influences, I would skip class, and my grades started declining. By some miracle, I managed to make the grades I needed to get into the Uni of my choice to do a Computer Science degree, however my life would only get worse. 

I made it through the whole first year of Uni without making any close friends. TLDR, I was very insecure about my looks, I did not mesh well with my first friend group, overheard them speaking about how awkward I was (which was true, I could not hold conversations and I also had this uncontrollable tremor which would occur whenever I was anxious). I stopped turning up to lectures and only attended labs. Again by some miracle, I passed first year with a 2:1.

During the summer holiday period, I got a job at a petrol station, which I was practically working full time (40-50 hour shifts). At first, I was an anxious mess, and many of my colleagues felt uncomfortable around me (I was quiet af and didn't know how to interact with people). However, as months went by I became a more social person, I made friends with most of my colleagues and customers. Despite this I could notice that both customers and colleagues would look down on me. 


During the last month, I decided to cut my hair short, as my hair had receded so much and became so thin, you could see the scalp. Since then there hasn't been a day where I've gone outside and not received either cold looks or people laughing at me. Over the past month there, have been numerous occasions where I would be restocking any shelves, customers would walk in and laugh in my face. Whenever I would serve tills I realised that 80% of people would make remarks on how I look. For instance, I realised that most women I serve would either make scoffing noises at me, give me funny looks or where straight up horrified by how I looked. Most men I served  would either have a smug grin, or straight up laugh at me. 


Fast forward to last week, my second year of Uni started. I've been feeling so shitty that I have straight up not attended Uni once. I would simply go to my local library, watch the lecture videos, and do the work there. However, even in the library people would make fun of me. Yesterday, a group of girls walked in and started laughing. As they sat down they started talking about how ugly I look in Bengali (I'm bengali btw), thinking that I wouldn't understand them. It has gone to a point where I don't enjoy living anymore (I don't feel suicidal dw), and I avoid going outside by any means possible. This has happened to me in the worst possible time, as I am in second year and I need to secure an internship for summer ASAP.",04Oct2019,1

I have never ever acted on that impulse but its terrifying knowing that exists inside of me. Because of this, I hardly ever use marijuana or any other drugs for that matter. I dont drink or use psychedelics and I'm generally normally functioning in everyday life (school, work, married, kids). I would like to use pot to relax once in awhile, take the edge off as it were, but I'm scared to death of the repercussions. Obviously the answer is to abstain from marijuana but I'm more curious as to if anybody else has had a similar experience and if so, what did you do about it?",04Oct2019,2

92,"Im currently 16 years old, in england and been struggling with my emotions for roughly 5 years now. My moods tend to go from happy to sad to happy to angry within either minutes or hours. 
I hate being around large numbers of people, and often get somewhat sad if im forced into a situation by a friend or teacher that has 15+ people in a room doing an activity. 
An example of my mood changing would be something that happened last week. I was in a lesson and I had felt quite sad going into that lesson, but soon started laughing because my friends were. After about 2 minutes of laughter my friend asked why I was laughing, so I tried to compose myself and stop laughing. In the end I felt quite sad and I felt like that for the rest of the day until I got home and able to talk to my boyfriend where I started to feel a little happier. 

My emotions changing within short periods of time is something thats been happening alot of late and multiple people have mentioned it to me, including my boyfriend who last night asked if I was bipolar. I said at first that I wasnt but searched up signs of bipolar online and now Im having second thoughts that its just “hormones” as Ive always been like this. 

When I was younger (around 8years old) one day my friend had to go home and I got angry that she had to go, threatened her with a knife. Not long after I got sad and went to apologise for my behaviour. Another example from when I was younger would be in school, especially in year 3, my mood on a monday was always bad due to my teacher so i’d always try to skip that day and Id go from a hood mood in the morning, to a terrible one by the time I realised id have to go to school. 

A couple years ago I cut myself, tried to commit suicide once, before being able to control my emotions somewhat. For two years until recent Ive been clean other than a couple of minor cuts (that havent caused scarring) and now im suddenly having a relapse out of nowhere. 

Thankyou for reading, any advice on how to either control my emotions or get a doctors appointment without my mum knowing would be greatly appreciated.",04Oct2019,1
93," I'm having a really hard time right now but I'm honestly too anxious to see a counselor too and I keep rescheduling. Idk how to get over it. I've never had counseling or a therapist and the thought of it freaks me out, i have no clue what I'm actually going to say once I'm in there.

I feel really inferior in comparison to my classmates. Critique makes me super anxious and it's caused me to want to skip class even though that just makes me feel bad in a different way.

All my classes are 6 hours long too and I get really restless and unable to concentrate after just an hour or two.

I have roommates as well and not having any personal space or time alone is difficult. It's adding to me wanting to skip class because I have just a small sliver of time to myself. Being around people 24/7 is making me bottle a lot of things up which is in turn making them worse.

I just kind of feel like I'm in this horrible loop where each thing I do makes something else worse.

I'm hours and hours away from anyone who cares about me or I'm close to.

Weekends are filled with nothing but homework because I have a huge workload, and sleeping because I feel exhausted. There's so much pressure. I keep hearing about people who have committed suicide here and I really fucking want out but at the same time I feel very locked in??

So this might be a stupid post to some of you but please if you can help in any way please do!  
I recently beat a video game and with the realization that I'll never see the main character again who I've been watching for the past 7 years, came this weird sadness(I wouldn't really call it depression as I can smile and laugh when I see something funny or talking to my folks at home, but once I'm alone with my thoughts I just keep thinking about the end of that franchise)that has been bugging me for the last 3 days and I can't seem to shake it off.  


I'm 20 years old and in the past 12 months I've cried 2 times which was both caused by fiction.  
However the 1st time I cried for a beloved character leaving a certain show, I returned to being my normal self in a day but this time I just can't seem to recover no matter what I do...  


I tried to play other games but I just can't...this weird sense of dread sets in once I fire up another game so I just end up listening the ending soundtrack to the game I'm crying about and watching random bits from it.  
Now I wouldn't be asking redditors about this but this isn't normal for me...I very rarely cry(I cried maybe 5 times in the last 7 years) and while I've felt lonely and sad before, it was nothing like this...I can't concentrate at work and I've noticed that I've been eating less these past few days so there...If anyone can offer any sort of advice or anything that will help me snap out of it please do...

It's hilarious because i've been sober for 2.5months, thanks to some people on these forums i was able to start a successful taper from suboxone, i take no more SSRI or psychoactive drugs, i eat my greens, medidate, breath correctly, quit drugs, caffeine and alcohol, am about to start a successful venture that will help other people (it's got charitable elements to it). So i got people telling me how 'great i look' and how 'proud they are'. ...

...But of course i can't tell them things like, today, at the cafe where i work, my groin muscles  clenched so hard from passive but general anxiety that my whole back seized and i felt humiliated to have looked stupid in front of the other clients. I cant' tell them that on my uber back, i was hoping the driver would fuck up and send us spinning into an ongoing truck. And i CERTAINLY cannot tell them how much i wish i relapsed on drugs so life can be hectic certainly but bearable again.

124,"I know the whole “if you see everyone else as having a problem most likely you’re the one with the problem.” I get it. And I can fully own up to my shortcomings and the extent in which I’m fucked up/unpleasant/toxic. I can even admit that I don’t interact with others the best on a daily basis or always react in a healthy, mature manner. Sometimes I’m downright aggressive over the stupidest shit. Usually for whatever reason I’m already at the end of my rope when that happens. Seems to happen a lot though. 

But thinking back on my life and current situation, it seems as if I can trace my depression  to certain events or interactions I’ve had with people and it just lingers and transforms and lingers some more. Abusive parents and siblings and all the toxicity and anxiety inducing experiences I’ve had growing up has done a lot to shape me into who I am now. An ex boyfriend who abused me for years (after I broke up with him, he was in and out of both jail and prison just to give you an idea of how bad of a guy he is). Not to mention all of this going on while I was forced into heavy involvement with a cult. Born and raised and not able to get out of it until my late 20’s.

And now I find myself married to a guy who’s damaged in a lot of ways. Emotionally abusive I would say. I mean, in comparison it’s nothing like I’ve experienced in the past. In some ways I can relate to him with all that. So you’d think I could handle it or brush it off better. And most of the time I do.  But other times I feel like I’m a shattered piece of shit being broken into even smaller pieces. But I’m stuck and I have nowhere to go and no one I can rely on. 

Saying I don’t make friends easily is a major understatement and when I do I eventually shut them all out. Currently, except for my husband, I truly have no one.  

On the rare days where I somehow manage to not be completely depressed, I find that there’s always something to drag me right back into it. Usually i only get a few hours of a break from it all.  Like I’m not allowed to feel anything other than constant anger that I have to keep shoved down. And you know where that leaves me most of the time? Managing to just remain civil and not physically hurt someone. At maximum that’s usually the most I can do. I honestly just don’t have the energy to be “happy” whatever the hell that even means. 

I’ve tried to distance myself as much as I can from my family. I sure as hell don’t talk to my ex anymore. And my husband, well... usually he’s the only one I can even deal with being around despite his shit.

126,"I don’t understand as to why I am besieged by sudden, intermittent thoughts of violent rage. They are disturbing because I feel consumed by a craving to execute a deeply disturbing display of violence  that appears to feed some maniacal, repressed desire for control. The episodes are periodic an un-consensual, each time adding a increasing level of gore and grandiosity over whichever heinous scenario my mind decides to concoct. 

I hate feeling this way. I have never acted upon these thoughts, except for occasionally punching holes into walls of my home and screaming loudly into the nothingness of an empty room.  I am aware that some of it has to do with the troubled and chaotic childhood I endured, but these episodes appear to recycle faces of the past, the present, and sometimes from a completely imaginary realm. It is a visceral anger that I can feel exploding from inside my head before it rapidly expands into my spine and limbs. I clutch my hands and arms as trying to fight it, contain, and kill it, but I can’t fully let it go nor interrupt it long enough to forget it. 

I am tired of them. Every time they subside, I feel emotionally and even physically  drained of my ability to think and carry out the normal tasks and demands of quotidian life.  I just cannot think, and the act of remembering simple chores, reading and learning become herculean efforts on their own. In the end, even my muscles feel strained and sore as if I had done vigorous exercise over an hour or so. It is not healthy, I need to find better ways to address it.

Not as much as I'd like to though, and I always feel guilty about that, but I do things, and I like spending time with my family so it's not like I stopped doing things I like, except for drawing, playing the piano and writing (but with the first two it was just like what's the use? And sometimes I still try to but not as often) and with the last one it's just... I suck at writing (as all beginners do) and my English is bad so... Idk. Also whenever I do fun things I feel guilty because I should be working on school. So I don't do fun things a lot (except for going out with the family because I don't want to miss out on that) but I always procrastinate with studying so  end up just staring blankly ahaid snuggled up in a blanket doing nothing and feeling guilty about it.  
I got sidetracked for a moment.  
Anyway.  
I have bad social anxiety so that might be part of whatever it is that's going on.  
My parents think I might have ADD, I think the same, but my doctor said I was about two points off when I did the test and since I managed to keep my focus filling out the test I probably didn't have it, even though I often get distracted while studying at home.  
I'm also tired all the time, but that might be because of my social anxiety.  
And I feel guilty all the time, for who I am, what I do and don't do, what I have done and haven't done, everything.",04Oct2019,1

137,"So one of the things I struggle with is hygiene, as most of us here do. My therapist often asks me how long since my last shower, and I usually don't know. I'm very busy and I lose track of time, and realize that oops, it's been 2 weeks or more.

So I started writing down each shower on my chalkboard after I take one. At first, it helped, I noticed when the one week mark hit and I took one, but this past time it took 2 weeks to get up the energy despite noticing the time between each one. But I showered this morning, because in my head 2 weeks is just too long, and wrote it down. I hope in the long run this will make a difference.

I've been fine~ish up until a few days/weeks ago (I'm not sure when exactly)

I have a feeling that whenever I relate to something too much then I automatically start believing I have that issue or am devoloping that issue.

I'm currently working on a report for college about anorexia, and as soon as I found credible sources of info I started to subconsciously assign the anorexic label to myself. I've been thinking of ways I can lose weight faster, how I want to look (i.e how thin I want to be) and how I'll be able to hide this from others.

Its worth noting that my self esteem is very low 99% of the time, I have this ideology that I can never be happy without something bad happening, and I feel as though my friends and classmates see me as the ugly annoying one. I've also taken any signs of a mental struggle I may have had and almost emmediately told myself I'm an attention seeker and that I don't deserve to feel this way because others have it worse.

143,"TLDR: First world problems, OP has self sabotaged his whole life. Started doing self improvement like reading and meditation but still kept having the same mindset and didn't see any changes. As a result he's kinda given up and just smokes weed/drinks in his spare time.

Hopefully this won't run too long but I'm posting it for people going through something similar or those who have made it out of this kind of life/mindset. 

From the outside looking in, a lot of people have told me that I have it made. Definitely not trying to brag but based on what I've been told I'm above average in the area of looks and intelligence. Last year I was jacked (roids lol) and had a good job with a good company, even was able to buy a nice american muscle car. I was getting a lot of attention from women and guys seemed to look at me differently with respect but I just never felt good about myself no matter how much external validation I was getting. I was wasting time and money smoking weed an ecf getting absolutely trashed every weekend. To be honest it was cause I didn't really put any effort into myself, and everything I achieved wasn't necessarily challenging. As a result I didn't do any better with women and sometimes it seems like I did better as a broke skinny college kid. 

To say I'm a failure is an overstatement but one thing that can't be denied is that I don't put enough work into reaching my potential. Last year I decided to get on the self improvement train. Started reading again and picked up meditation/affirmations.It worked after 2 or so months  and I started to feel relaxed and confident. But that wore off shortly. I stopped meditating consistently and started to slip back into my old ways of weed, alcohol, and porn. 

Towards the beginning of the summer around the end of May/June I started up again with the consistent meditation and affirmations. Mainly because I had an interview scheduled at the end of the summer so I knew I had to be on my game. Quit drugs and alcohol too. Made my bed everyday and kept my place spotless, which is normally a challenge  for me. I even picked up running at 6am twice a week with a friend. 

Problem is nothing changed. I met a girl but still acted awkward around her despite her blatant attraction.She stopped talking to me after a month or so. Despite 3 months of meditation, affirmations and living a pure clean life I totally fucked up the interview. I memorized everything and meditated right before it but I was still super nervous. They didn't select me  despite acknowledging my intelligence. 

I was crushed cause I really wanted it.After that I kinda lost faith in my ability to pull myself out of this hell via meditation or reading. And so I slipped back into my old ways of weed and alcohol. I even have stopped working out, which I used to do everyday. 

I'm my own worst enemy and that needs to change but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do something in my subconscious just always holds me back. Im always thinking people don't like me for no reason. I'm good with people and even have a job in sales but no matter what I just feel unfulfilled. 

How can I change my subconscious mind and just become the best version of myself? Really feels like meditation, affirmations, or reading and other self improvement stuff just doesn't help. I can't even bring myself to meditate because I don't believe in it anymore. The other day I was told that I'm six figures waiting to happen and I'd hate to live life without reaching my full potential. 

Has anyone ever pulled themselves out of a similar situation? I've started up again but the belief aspect just isn't there..",04Oct2019,1
144,"Does anyone here have any advice for enjoying video games/off-time in general without weed or alcohol?

I really want to stop spending so much money on booze and THC pills. Yet, whenever I try to play a game / watch a movie / read a book / go for a walk / etc while sober, I'm pestered by one of two persistent thoughts.

""I should be doing something more productive/responsible right now"" (This is despite nothing urgent being needed)

""I would be enjoying this more if I was drunk or high.""

I tend to function pretty normally when Im inebriated. My wife, who is always sober, never has a problem with my behaviour. If anything I think she enjoys that Im more expressive and interested in doing things without much notice. Im generally happier with a buzz going, of course, so I think that naturally leads to positive interactions.

But I cant keep spending money on this stuff, even if I still enjoy it. We're trying to have a kid, and I know Ill have to be okay with being sober when there's a baby to take care of. Im honestly not worried about the hard work of childcare, Im more worried about being bored and listless during any free time I have when Im sober.

149,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share some things that have happen to my life and how I am feeling. I am 18M and I moved from a European country to the US about a year ago due to financial reasons. I was really anxious how things would turn out in school and making new friends.  

The first days were really difficult as I was adjusting to a new school. I was really optimistic that I would find some new friends and everything would be good. However I was wrong. I didn't really start conversations with other kids and I was expecting others to approach me, as I am a shy character. I kept sitting alone in the cafeteria and I didn't have any interactions with anyone. I tried joining a couple of clubs, but they weren't my thing. 

This went on until this day. I am a senior right now, and I feel always so down. I spend every day in my home, surf the web and do literally nothing. I really would like to go and hang out with someone, but I don't know anyone. I am constantly feeling depressed and have negative thoughts. A few months ago, the idea of suicide came to my mind, but I already knew that wasn't a solution and it only remained in the mind of my head and it faded away. During that time I even tried some drugs that helped me escape reality temporarily,  but I already knew that it's not a solution and I didn't keep taking them. Right now I feel miserable,tired, I have great grades and I have dreams about going to a university and have a bright future. But I just want to quit everything and do nothing. I feel so alone and sad. 

The only time I felt really happy was when I want on vacation to my home country for 20 days and had probably the best time of my life with my old friends, it was great. Now, I'm back and do nothing every day. I feel like negative thoughts are eating me alive.

156,"I'm a Software Engineer and I'm dealing for several years with the following problem that I call the SnowBall Note Effect:

I find that I spend too much time writing notes that I don't get to use as much but it feels so important to me when I'm writing then down that I can't accept to stop doing it. These notes rarely helped me cause either I forgot that they existed or I changed jobs so I don't need all that clutter anymore. Even knowing that, I still feel their are valuable so I refuse to get rid of them until they are properly categorised and reviewed. Sometimes I even had the thought of taking holidays to do this! 

Is a snowball because the problem gets bigger and bigger with the time and I can end up feeling anxious if not keeping  a good maintenance and control of it. This like represents my mind state or something like that.

The reason why I feel this is important is because I use them as I way to fix myself. I note my mistakes, how to avoid them. I intend to review them later, but I never do cause I am always stressed or with no time. This is why I believe I can't get rid of them because to me, these are recipes of how to fix my common mistakes or memory. Is like system that would make me perfect if I can keep it under control. But I don't, at the end this are bunch of notes that I feel lazy to read but that I can't delete in case there is something valuable in it.

I also, record everything that seems important to me. I just have the need to have records of everything I think or hear that seems important. Like if I am afraid of forgetting that and I want to remember that I had this thoughts or ideas in the future.

When I look back to this notes sometime in the future, I found them a little crazy and thinking why do I need to write this? I create template notes for meetings, projects, know errors or detailing a taking notes process step by step or describing how to deal with emotions, what actions to take, etc. This is so time consuming and weird.

Did this happened to you? Is this an illness? If so, what's the name? Why I can't stop doing it? I want to archive all my digital notes to start again building up from an empty space/mind. But I can't don't do it. I feel I need to.

&amp;#x200B;

So, something happens to me from time to time (or constantly, I don't know which is true, since it seems to only happen when I pay attention to it). This ""something"" manifests as an oppression in my chest (imagine having a solid ball of air), that only goes away if TWO things happen:

1- I inhale and exhale, profoundly.

2- It wants to go away.

&amp;#x200B;

It can't go away if I don't do step 1, but doing step 1 is not enough unless it wants to go away, as said in step 2. There's no defined process that always helps. I sometimes have to repeat step 1 many times. ""Many times"" meaning ""so many times that I start experiencing physical pain in the muscles used to inhale and exhale"".

Anyway, one may obviously think that this is physical, and that I have respiratory problems or something like that. Well, that would be my go-to explanation if it wasn't for these things:

1- It doesn't happen while I'm asleep.

2- It doesn't happen, or I don't notice it, while I'm thoroughly distracted. If I had a broken arm, I believe I wouldn't be able to ""be distracted enough"" to not notice it.

&amp;#x200B;

This ""something"" is not new. It has happened since... well, since it has happened.  A problem with this is that since it doesn't happen when I don't think about it, I can't really remember when it started happening, but it's been some years.

&amp;#x200B;

I have some exams I'm studying for, and it's hard to concentrate on studying while also actively concentrating on breathing like an absolute idiot to eliminate that ridiculous feeling that nobody else has, since otherwise I can't study.
