2,"So, I’ve (33F) known I’ve had some unresolved mom bullshit for a while.  It started to all pour out this weekend. I googled “books on healing the mother wound.”  This one seemed like the best fit. 

I don’t think I would have known to label my mother as emotionally immature before reading this book,  but she fits the bill. 

The book is blowing my mind apart - explaining emotionally immature parent archetypes, the types of children they produce, how these children act in adulthood, and how to heal that part of yourself. 

If you think any of your own bullshit may come from a relationship with an emotionally immature parent, I can’t recommend this book enough.

5,"Okay, this is my first reddit post. Hi guys.

Last weekend, I had a horrible night. I was at a Halloween party, dressed up as a a Joker (my own version of him) and afterwards, I had a massive mental breakdown. I started laughing and screaming like a freak and walked across train tracks and highways without caring about my own safety. I damaged several things, but thankfully didn't hurt anyone.

It's ironic to me that I was dressed like the Joker and did this.  I am NOT obsessed with the Joker. I am a fan of the character, but I don't want to BE him.

Additionally, every time someone gets too close to me, I desperately TRY to get them to hate me. I always regret it. I have horrible mood swings, and strange interests (Real violence, etc.). I am manipulative (often unintentionally) and I feel alone a lot, though there are many people who care about me and would be there for me anytime. I can't open up to someone I know, because I'm scared that they would be too disturbed and leave me. 

So many contradictions in my mind, I don't even know what to believe sometimes... I lie so much, I can't tell true and false apart. I joke around and act like nothing's wrong, I think I myself forget how much is wrong sometimes.

Someone indicated that I might have borderline syndrome? But I ain't sure. I hate therapists. I despise em, though they might be the smartest choice. Think I'll never know. Still wanna know what you guys think.",07Nov2019,6
6,"After years of trying to keep myself together following a hospitalisation with severe mental issues, over the last two years I feel like I have kept myself afloat in a way that I have never managed before with two simple things:

1. Without fail, I always shower in every 24 hour period. This is my baseline and although it was any in the beginning and I often left it until 11.58pm before agreeing in and turning on the water, I've now been going for nearly three years.
2. I clean one room a day. I used to wait several weeks until the while house was so dirty, then I would spend a whole day cleaning everything and then let it go again.

Now I always clean one room. The bedrooms are ready. The bathroom I feel a little resistance to, but I'm in the habit now. The kitchen can be a hassle because there's so much stuff in there, so I break that into two to three days depending on how I'm feeling. The living room is another easy one. My favourite super quick one is the hallway. I have a couple of standby cheat options for when I'm feeling rough: the closet and the balcony. All in all the cycle takes about a week, and I throw different things like just cleaning the fridge or the garage, or the car.

These two things make such an enormous difference to my day, and I can also build on the self-esteem they give me and do other things. I can also measure my mood based on my resistance to doing them. I rarely works now then 20 to 30 minutes each day with these but it somehow means I get more done and feel much lighter when I've got these things to hold onto.",07Nov2019,2

11,"Hi World of Reddit-

**Disclaimer**  
This is going to be a bit of a winded post, I apologize in advance for the long read. I've been working to manage my mental health for close to three decades now and my hope is to paint a relatively detailed picture so that you fine folks might be able to help point me in the right direction. Because of the nature of the human mind, I know there's no completely correct or one-size-fits-all answer, so I welcome any constructive feedback or insights. I'm using a dummy account to avoid the sigmas that surround having ""questionable"" posts in your history...but I've been a part of Reddit for many years. However, this is my first post in the Mental Health section; if there's a more proper thread I'm happy to move there and apologize for the mispost.

**Executive Summary**  
The goal of this post is to give you a detailed insight into my past and current state of mental health, in hopes that you might be able to provide feedback or ideas on how to meet my next goals. As of today, my mental health is stable, but not enjoyable. From recent experiences I suspect there might be something different I could be doing to help me reach a better state. I have a regular PCP I visit today and have spent time with many psychiatrists and psychologists in the past. I value the input they have each given me and it's all helped in some ways, but many times their recommendations or conclusions are contradictory (i.e., try this medication, no try this, no do this, not that, it's fine, no it's not.....etc).

**Basic Stats**  
I'm a 31 year old white male. I'm in average shape. I'm not a gym rat by any means but I like to stay active. (Cardio a couple times a week) I'm thankful to be a very physically healthy person; as I don't have any outstanding or previous health issues. I do my best to eat a balanced diet, although I do like coffee and soda. I don't smoke, do not use illegal drugs and socially drink. (4 drinks in a week would be alot for me, many weeks I do not drink at all) I've never been married, I have no kids or pets. Haven't had an ""official"" or serious girlfriend for close to 10 years. I'm college educated and very career oriented. 

**Brief Family History**  
My family is no stranger to mental health. My mother is a screaming alcoholic, who is manic-depressive. She's always refused to be properly medicated, so she's used painkillers, alcohol and cigarettes as vices. Her mother was also manic-depressive, who took lithium her entire life. 

My father has struggled with panic disorder since his thirties, although he was able to manage and eventually overcome it. 

I'm an only child and my childhood was a nightmare. Until my parents split at the age of 12, they absolutely HATED each other. I have scars from dodging glass ashtrays that they would throw at each other and they screamed more than they talked. I was only hit a few times, mostly they just loved to take their emotional anger out on me. Everything was my fault. Once they split, my mother fought to keep custody and put me through hell. She gave up on work, drove us to a point where power was being shut off monthly and food was a luxury. One day in my college years she disappeared and left me to foreclose on the house I grew up in and basically close out her legal life. I have not seen or talked to her since, nor do I ever plan to. 

I have a decent relationship with my father and stepmother; I see them around once a year. But it's nothing spectacular or incredibly emotionally deep, more of just like having a neighbor you get along with. 

I graduated college and moved as far away as possible. I work hard everyday to grow my career and am financially self-sufficient. I have a home, a truck, retirement goals and health insurance. (Not trying to brag or flaunt, just hoping to demonstrate that unlike my childhood, my adult life is stable and gives me the tools needed to help me improve my mental health) 

**Diagnosis History**  
Starting at the age of 8, I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder, OCD and GAD. I remember having panic attacks that would last well over 45 minutes, with violent shaking, racing thoughts, heart palpitations, hot and cold feelings, nausea...all your typical symptoms. I was placed on several different medications which helped to alleviate the symptoms, but all came with caveats, such as fatigue, zombie states, mania, depressive states etc. We finally landed on a combo that seemed to work for a few years and by the time I entered high school, I was able to progress through daily life without the need for medication. 

When I got to my third year of college, symptoms started to appear again, this time in the form of depression and OCD. I visited both previous and new mental health professionals who again began to prescribe various drugs to help. This process went on for a few years until we landed on my current regimen, more on that in the next section. 

My depressive episodes leave me wanting to sleep all the time. I do not enjoy the things I typically would in life, at all. I've never been suicidal, but have considered what it would be like to not wake up. I never want to leave my bed and can sleep for 20+ hours a day without any sleeping pills or the like. Even eating becomes a chore and I typically don't. 

**Prescriptions**   
If I outlined each prescription I've tried and the effects it had, we'd be here all night. To save time, I will say I've tried the gamut of popular medications out there. Paxil, Cymbalta, Celexa, Prozac, Effexor to name a few. Both SSRI and SSNIs. 

My current regimen is as follows...  
1. Lexapro - 20mg - nightly  
2. Wellbutrin XL - 450mg - each morning   
3. Xanax - 0.5mg - as needed 

I've been using this combination for approximately 6 years. When followed, I rarely have a panic attack (once a month) and they are very mild. My depression is manageable; I maintain the willingness to do things and keep my life in order.

**Current Concerns and Hopeful Improvements**   
While the current setup above works, last year I was travelling and was forced to cut out Lexapro for approximately two weeks. During days following the cut off, I felt **AMAZING**. I had a TON of energy (I wasn't wired, but I didn't feel exhausted like I normally would after sleeping 8 hours) I was genuinely happier and folks noted on how I was more lighthearted. I felt more motivation to do things, like go to the gym. I felt more confident and proud of myself. My sex drive went through the ROOF...which was a nice change considering that while on Lexapro, it usually takes some work to get me going...it's not impossible, but without Lexapro it's like flipping a switch. 

However, after 3 weeks, things started to change. The feelings above started to diminish and mild anxiety with depression started to creep in. Brain zaps started to happen hourly (a common Lexapro withdrawal side-effect). I slipped deeper into depression. My self confidence again tanked and I was falling well below the typical ""baseline"" I'd established while on Lexapro. My dreams became incredibly vivid and sometimes scary; I even had dreams where I'm sleeping and wake up in the dream, thinking it's real life. Finally I got back on Lexapro and within about a month, things were back to ""normal"". 

When I mentioned this to my Psychologist, she explained that the amazing feelings I had were mania and NOT the way I could expect to normally feel. My PCP honestly wasn't sure what to make of the situation and said I should consider some research. I trust my PCP and she's willing to work with me, but I explained that I'm hesitant to make changes until I know more, considering the devastating effects a full Lexapro removal had. 

So that's my story. I think my life would be so much better if I could feel like I did for those first couple weeks without Lexapro (minus the brain zaps), but is it real? Is it even obtainable or just a side effect of a floodgate of serotonin? Very interested to hear your thoughts and happy to answer any questions. Thank you for taking the time to read.",07Nov2019,1

17,"I am the only female in a man’s field. I love my job but I’ve had a history of having dudes wig out over my ‘clueless puppy dog face’.

Now, personally I call it a ‘blank face’ but when I use it it’s because they ask me a loaded question that have no answer that doesn’t make them angry or start yelling at me. 

For instance today I counted 213-218 of an object at work as I was told but apparently took too long and he asked ‘when were you going to tell me the number’ I answered him the number and he decided it  ‘wasn’t an answer’.

So I started explaining I was trying to get the exact count, so I recounted three times. He ignored this answer and angrily approached me and lectured me on how he wants his numbers immediately.

This is fine, except he didn’t tell me he didn’t care about exact numbers or not earlier. So I chose exact number to be on the safe side. It’s also not fine because when he lectured me I just blank faced because he reads my expressions and assumes I’m ‘this or that’ emotion and then gets more upset at me. 

Anywho, blank face is happening so I don’t get him angry. And he starts asking if I understand him so I said ‘yes’ and he asks ‘do you get it?’ And I say ‘it is english’

And he looses his shit.

But asking someone if they understand a simple sentence and them saying yes several times... what else is left? 


I’ve had this problem before with a few people over my life. I just don’t know any more. Who do I go to that can assess if something is wrong with my mind ? A psychologist? A doctor? A shrink? I feel like something is wrong , because people don’t listen to me and then assume I don’t know something. They say I don’t answer their questions when I did. They say I’m not listening when I just stated back what they said to clarify if it’s what they wanted with a yes or no answer.

32,"These days i tend to think of myself as an emotionally stable person, but if left on my own i just pursue entertainment and knowledge without any plans to use it. I also very much enjoy entertaining others, but as an introvert i mostly do this online, and very much enjoy creating content but i failed or yet to make that passion into a living.

People tend to label me intelligent, but i have been often demeaned for my lack of action, lazy and stupid are the most common word choices. They expect me to want more and do more, and they are right, often times i just barely got by, and got helped from family multiple times, and i am 30 by now. In no rush to do anything, no burning desire to shape the world with a stopwatch like seemingly most people.

Not so long ago i had decent success with following a calendar, i was working out every day, i was trying to be more efficient, and that worked for about half a year, but i just stopped. No idea why, it's possible that i was just doing too much, i could be quite the tyrant to myself, and i could always effortlessly spend my time with my interests all day everyday no matter how difficult they are, but forcing myself makes me miserable, and in the past also made me depressed, and i do realize that many do the same just to get by, and there are other options out there. I spent my time learning web development online on my own as a compromise, kind of like it but have no passion for it and i did end up quitting twice, but not like most at the start, i quit twice at the end with like a year between, the second time i actually finished the course, but just as the structure of the course stopped, feels like i was almost looking for an excuse to give up, which is totally irrational, no one forced me, it was something i choose.

Perhaps i am little too used to life getting worse, not that i am pessimist i believe, but i am definitely not as hopeful as i was when i was a teenager. All screwed in the head, cocky, used to taking challenges effortlessly, even these days i never doubt my ability to get something done, i doubt my will.

I am certain if i got my act together i could save myself a lot of grief, and i believe i need structure focus my efforts but also freedom to be myself.

I have an interest in psychology as well and read books that helped, and i really believed i was past this, that i finally cracked the code to life. 

I didn't write this to feel good and continue doing nothing, or perhaps get feel good replies, i just want to crack this problem that haunts me, that no one seemingly has an answer to other than ""put in more effort"", which certainly gets short term results that in my experience they are eager to take credit for but it's crap advice, it's about as helpful as telling a guy with a flat bike tire to pedal harder.

36,"I try to shrug it off and tell myself that I'm just projecting, but some specific people at uni seem to not value me as much as I value them. The fact that I notice differences in how I'm treated in comparison to others in the same group adds up to this feeling. I feel like I should have never tried to make friends there, since most (not all) people I have met there during those two years were complete waste of my time and mental resources. I'm sorry for sounding like an incel or something of the sort, this is a part of me that I'm trying to not act on, but I can't help but feel extremely resentful.",07Nov2019,4
37,"So my mental health is shit at the moment. I started anti-depressants in summer 2018 and they worked pretty well up until my ex (who I thought I was gonna marry) dumped me in the spring. A lot of factors went in but basically everything spiraled and I became very suicidal. I increased my dosage and was okay ish until I decided to stop taking them over this past summer. I just hated feeling happy because of a medication and I wanted to be happy just bc I was happy, but I’m still ridiculously depressed and my head is so fucked up from that last relationship that I can’t even begin to form new ones. My parents really want me to get back on the meds or try going to therapy at least, but the last time I tried therapy (2 yrs ago maybe) it just didn’t do it for me. Maybe my therapist wasn’t a good match for me or something, but I’m interested to see how going to therapy has helped you out. I’d rather not go back onto medication, but at this point I really have to do something or I’m gonna lose it. :)",07Nov2019,3
38,"So lately I've been having SUPER rapid mood swings, extremely intense anxiety, depressive episodes, and what I think might be panic attacks over the smallest things. For example, when something good happens, or I'm taking to someone I like, I'll be in a super happy, energetic, sometimes confident, and in a joking mood for a few hours at most, but then after hardly any time at all I'll be in a terrible, terrible mood where I have no motivation whatsoever, am constantly on the verge of crying, am constantly talking down on myself. I also as previously stated have been having what I think are panic attacks or something along those lines where I feel like I can't breathe, have a really hard time not crying, can't think straight, make super rash decisions, am shaky, sometimes sweaty, stutter, get massive migraines, and get naucious. This occasionally happens out of nowhere without a cause, but usually has a trigger. For example, when I have to present something or talk in front of my class. This also happens over extremely small things though, like not being able to find something, or my earbuds breaking. I'll know that these are just simple problems and I shouldn't be freaking out, but I do, and I don't know why. It's just like I'm constantly on the verge of cracking and anything and everything no matter how simple makes me crack. I know that's a weird metaphor thing but yeah. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to stop/cope with these panic attack things, my anxiety, and/or make my deoressive episodes less severe? I know people will probably say  I should talk to a doctor or something, and I definitely should, but I am NOT ready at the moment. I will eventually but I need a temporary fix or I swear I'm gonna fucking crack man. As of now, listening to music and just blocking everything out is my only coping method, but one of my earbuds stopped working so I can't block everything out which is like I said a way I cope and idk what to do and I just really need advice.

40,"Over the past few years I’ve struggled a lot with mental illnesses and I’m sure my friends know that. I self harm all of the time, one time my friend went to use my bathroom and saw one of my razor blades. She asked me about it and I froze. I kinda just swerved and said I used it to shave.  

They know I struggle and have struggled a lot in the past. They saw me at my worst and saw me bounce back. I think about death all of the time and it’s starting to show. I lost my therapist last year, and all I have is my friends right now. I love them so much but am so scared to tell them what’s going on. I don’t even know how to tell them. When to tell them. Or if i should tell them. 

Idk I guess a part of me feels like it would be selfish to ask for help. Or that they would be too tired to help me out as they have seen me go through this before, however, I was not this bad.

41,My sister died of brain cancer. I had no one to turn to. So I DM my therapist that my sister died. She didn't respond sorry for your loss nothing like that.

42,I am extremely depressed right now i dont have any friends in person i have about 6-7 friends who i have met online though video games but thats it im not too bothered about not having friends in person i think i feel like this because im desperate for a romantic relationship i just want someone who will like me for me and to just do innocent stuff with like holding hands and just being there for each other but i dont know where to find other people like me. The main reason is because one of my friends goes on about his friends from college and their relationships and it just makes me want to slam my head on a pike because of how ive never been anywhere close to that in my life i just dont know how to go about things,07Nov2019,1
43,"When i was around fourteen i started to believe I was capable of starting another holocaust. i thought it wouldn't be hard to start an army. my holocaust was never going to be targeted towards another race, just that i could do it with the right start.

The paranoia is a totally different thing. when i skateboard around town or even just walk around in general i think people are following me in their cars. not just one or two though, but multiple, and there all talking to each other as if to watch me. 

I sometimes convince myself Im in a simulation and that on the other side, people are studying  me, trying to figure out what i would do when confronted with certain situations.

44,"I have suffered from undiagnosed anxiety my entire life, especially social anxiety. I have an extremely hard time meeting people, maintaining eye contact, participating in conversations and especially terrible at maintaining relationships. I am probably the most shy and introverted person you'd ever meet (unless there is alcohol involved in which case I'm the complete opposite).

I'm not sure what the underlying cause is. I'm sure 90% of the problem stems from my complete lack of self esteem and confidence, but part of the problem could be from feeling tired all the time. I have noticed I'm **much** more talkative and confident on the odd day that I feel well rested (maybe once per year).

Anyway, I finally decided to do something about it and signed up for a therapy app where I can chat with a therapist, however I'm not feeling totally satisfied. She just says things like try and embrace the anxiety and tell your self to relax, as if I haven't tried that before. She's not really focusing on my root self esteem problems. I also did a small checkup today which says I'm at low risk for depression, but that doesn't seem believable because something definitely seems off.

Anyway, I'm not sure how to move forward. Should I try switching therapists? Should I check with a regular doctor to see why I'm so tired all the time which is a big contributor to my unwillingness to socialize or ask them about anxiety medication?",07Nov2019,2
45,"All my (16F) life I have taught myself to be the highest achieving person in my class. I have always been that “smart person” and the one who personally knew the principal. I always had a resume filled since element school. I always had rigorous extra curriculares and pretty good grades. 
Going into my junior year of highschool, I feel like a sell out. I feel like I cheated everyone and myself. Everyday I try to hide behind this eccentric and intelligent personality when on the inside I feel as dumb as a brick. Everyone around has had great opportunities and no matter how hard I look I’m always met with simple shit. When I see people at school who are doing better than myself, I beat myself up. Badly. 
Although I was placed above my grade level in math, my friends are two grades above me because I was too scared I wouldn’t be able to focus on an AP class two grades above mine. When I see people get opportunities, I just want to delete myself for not being good enough for them .Anytime I hear about SAT scores, although I may be in the mid 80s percentile, I just cringe at other people boasting about theirs because , just maybe, if I would have studied I would’ve gotten there.
Even something as simple as just talking to someone, sometimes I stubble over myself or I can’t hear/understand (I generally have bad hearing) what they’re saying and I just end up looking like a dumbass. 
  I’ve always planned to go a great college, and now I am met with this haunting fear that I am not enough. That I was never enough in the first place. And I just wish someone could understand.

47,"Your brain is providing the illusion that things still matter. They have a 0% impact on your life physically, they only affect you mentally. 

After 6 months, most things don't matter. 

By mid-2012, my fights with mum didn't matter. 
By early 2016, those fights with former friends online didn't matter.

Here you are in 2019 constantly fretting about both. 

Both are fairly trivial. 

There was a rumour about me on a Facebook group that claims I threatened assault on someone — but it was posted in bad faith, by a group with the slogan ""Don't forget to be assholes"", a community which routinely harasses and humiliates people, many people tweet against them, and you've been to the police about the claim, welcoming further action.

In 6 months, they forgot about it and you. 

Yes, you were a dick as a teenager. In 6 months, it didn't matter. 

You're fine. 

If your brain worked like most people, neither of those would affect you 6 months later. 

Usually people live day-by-day, quickly forgetting about the past and focusing on what is in front of them.  Moving on, per ce. 

Instead, you're obsessed at 24 with this that happened from 15-19.

For some reason, you're not blessed with the ability to move on.

50,"I created this throwaway because I'm a bit embarrassed to be honest. I just want some outside opinions on this but I'm scared to talk about this with those I am close to for fear of a negative reaction from them. 

Sometimes I get these random intrusive and negative thoughts, most of the time gruesome. As an example, a thought that I just had that pushed me to make this post was that I was thinking about going to get my dog from the living room to go to bed because currently she is injured and cannot walk well and the rest of my household has just gone to bed. While I was just having the thought of ""oh I need to go get her"" my mind immediately went to ""oh my god what if she tried to get up but couldn't and fell at an awkward angle and is now suffocating?"" Something like this is highly unlikely and I don't think many people would have this thought immediately. It comes up randomly, and without warning. It's completely situational, where like if I am texting my boyfriend who is coming to pick me up, I will randomly have the thought of him getting into a brutal car accident and dying on the road and I would have no way of knowing. Sometimes when I hear a noise in my house late at night when everyone else is asleep I will have the thought and the image of ""oh my god there is someone in the house and I am going to get killed and raped."" These thoughts usually come with vivid images as well, and I hate that I can't stop them. I am usually very good with disproving the negative thought once it occurs, because I know in reality it's a highly unlikely possibility, but of course it doesn't stop them from occurring in the first place. I have always had an overactive imagination, but I feel like this is next level shit.

I hope that I do not sound like a lunatic in this post and I am sure that it would be advised that I see a therapist maybe, but I'm really curious as to if this is more common than I may be assuming it is among people. I would like to believe that it is one of those things that everyone really experiences but no one talks about because of the nature of it, but I feel as if there might be something wrong with the way my mind works and that I should seek out a therapist about this.",07Nov2019,1

54,"Sorry this is going to be a long, rambling post. I feel like I'm back to being stuck again in a very gray zone and I'm confused with how to process what I'm feeling. 

I (22F) have been feeling extremely passive and unmotivated about life. Since I'm graduating soon, I keep having to deal with questions and pressure about what my future plans are after college. I can't tell if this is because I'm an inherently lazy person or me trying to hide from the crushing stress. I was the typical overachieving kid all the way up until high school and my friends' parents would always use me as some sort of ""standard"" of success. And now I'm the only one in the group who doesn't have any immediate or far reaching plan of what to do in life. It's a bitter pill to swallow. 

In college, I just sort of crashed. I don't know if it was burnout or something else, but it came to a point where the only reason I got out of bed was to go to class because of my intense fear of failure. There was a point in my life where I wanted to do nothing but lie there in all my misery, but the only thing that compelled me to move and go through the motions was fear of judgement by others and fear of failure. I had(?) suicidal ideation almost every day and some days it was literally the only thing occupying my mind. I felt like the primary factors that kept me from actually doing anything was my fear of pain and my family's disappointment. There were a couple of times I was on the road and had an overwhelming urge to just drive into oncoming traffic, but I was rational enough to reason that it was a bad way to go because it would hurt other people in the process.

I don't want to self-diagnose of course, but as someone who's studied a related field for four years and worked in a clinic that regularly treated cases of anxiety, depression, and the like, I would look at the diagnostic tests the physician used and saw a lot of myself in those tests. I have trouble with social interaction (though I think I've gotten better with it as some time has passed) which resulted in me secluding myself (I rarely leave the house outside of for classes or for work) and cutting a lot of friendships. I can't bring myself to face my friends who are doing well. I constantly pick apart interactions in my head and drag myself down with overthinking which usually leads to interpreting situations in the worst way possible. I feel like everyone is silently judging every little thing I do. I used to panic about having to buy things on my own or making telephone calls. I ended up finding a way to cope with it by pretending that I was putting on a mask/putting on a play which led me to questioning if my existence was even real or not or if I was a robot being controlled by someone because I ended up getting too into my head. I'm terrified of trying new things or deviating out of my routine to the point where I struggle to stay calm when driving to a new place. The smallest things make me feel on the verge of crying. One time I came home from school to see a pile of dishes in the sink and I don't know what it was about it (maybe the way it was stacked? Or I just felt stressed about having to do so many?) but I just felt like crying and breaking all of them. After hitting a real low point, I just felt numb to a lot of things after that. I still functioned normally everyday (showered, went to class, got good grades). I still was interested in things (though there were periods where nothing could interest me no matter how much I wanted to do something) but it felt more like an escape since the moment I wasn't paying attention to it, everything felt suffocating again. A lot of times I would set little things to look forward to in order to keep going like seeing a TV show finale that was airing in a month. Or waiting to watch an upcoming sports competition. After that, there was a period where I felt really proactive like a go-getter. I felt optimistic that I could change/improve my situation. I tried putting effort into things.  And then it went back to the previous situation where everything felt bleak and I felt like I had no purpose/was a waste of space. And then a little bit after that I felt like I reached some sort of balance in my life. 

But now it's like a weird limbo. Like everything is still in the back of my mind. For obvious reasons, I decided to stop pursuing a career in medicine and now I'm being pushed to give an answer as to what I'm going to be doing as a future career. And I'm coming up empty. My degree that I'm finishing is pretty niche so outside of medicine, it's not very applicable. I keep getting asked what I'm passionate about but the thing is I can't come up with anything. (To add, I have very low self-esteem/confidence so when I think about possible careers I start overthinking about whether I am even capable enough to do something and I sort of have a never-ending loop of anxiety and passivity). I know it's a pressing issue and I AM getting extremely stressed whenever someone brings it up or I try to think about it. But I also feel so unmotivated that a lot of times I push it to the back of my mind as some sort of avoidance. Not that that's helping me any. I am aware I am just running away from my problems, but at the same time I feel very fatalistic about everything. The suicidal ideation is still there (though less persistent) and a lot of times I ask myself ""Why bother?"" since I can't really see myself living past 26. So it's a constant cycle of 1. someone mentioning the problem 2. I get stressed 3. I do things to forget about it. 4. rinse and repeat. I am just so unmotivated to do anything, even things that I like/have been wanting to do for a while, and it feels like the only reason I do anything is to keep up with appearances. It's not that I'm unhappy all the time. But a lot of the time I just feel nothing. 

My biggest fear is that I'm subconsciously doing this for attention. Growing up, my parents always complimented me for being the ""perfect child"" since my older sibling has a bad relationship with my parents and they also spent most of their time taking care of my younger sibling with ASD. I ended up doing a lot of things myself at home and helping out with taking care of the family (mediating family disputes). And I think I just subconsciously just forced this huge burden of their expectations on myself so I was scared of stepping out of line or making trouble. I have tried using my campus's counseling/mental health services but I just felt like she didn't really believe anything I was saying/that I was making a big deal out of nothing which has furthered this fear. 

Objectively, I have a good life with no major obstacles and I'm aware of it. Nothing bad has actually happened to me. I see and know people going through worse. I know it's not a sadness competition, but just knowing that life is okay yet I'm still feeling like this makes me feel worse about myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Severe lack of motivation to do anything which is causing my stress even though I also can't muster up the motivation to do anything about it. I don't know if I'm just lazy scum or if there's more to it. Not officially diagnosed with anything. Wish therapy was an option but my parents refuse (cultural aspect, don't want anything to be ""officially recorded"" in case it ruins my future prospects). Immediate problem is future plans for career. Far reaching problem I guess would be to fight this overwhelming passivity. Feel like at the slightest problem, I immediately revert into a fatalistic way of thinking like ""I'd rather just die than deal with this."" Stuck in a cycle. I honestly don't know if I'm looking for life advice or just wondering if other people also feel similarly/have experience with this feeling and that I'm not alone.",07Nov2019,1

I’m scared of the truth. I’m scared of losing those who I love because of my own  terrible actions. But I’m more scared of telling them everything I’m feeling and being ignored. I’m more scared of them excluding me for my sexuality, or using my apologies against me at a later date. Most of all I’m scared that no one will ever love me for who I am.

I want to learn how to be better, and I won’t leave because I want to make people happy. I want to be good and that is the thread I’m holding onto. I know I’m nothing but a disgrace.

I want to be good and that is the thread I’m holding onto, a thread that I’m hoping will get stronger overtime. I know I’m nothing but a disgrace. A mistake as a result of failed birth control pills. I fuck up more than I do things right.

59,"So my family and I are going to Bali soon. 

It wasn't until recently I started worrying so much. There is the potential of Mosquitos with diseases, unsafe water, unsafe alcohol, unsafe food and there will be vastly different laws and culture. 

It is all so overwhelming when thinking about the things that could go wrong. Recently there have been many cases of methanol poisoning in Bali. 

Anxiety sucks. Millions of people also go to Bali and are completely fine.

61,"I have a lot of problems with myself. I’m 15, male, living in Oregon, and I have diagnosed autism. I constantly struggle with things like depression, anxiety, and self esteem. I am fairly overweight and I don’t see it changing any time soon. I’ve barely gone to school in the past few weeks, just staying home playing video games and browsing reddit. Whenever I’m told to do something I don’t want to do, I just clam up and resist until one of us gives in. I stay up late at night on electronics, sleeping until around noon and only eating 2 meals a day. In life I almost always take the easy way out of a problem, usually making it worse in the process. When I have a depressive episode I always try to convince myself I need to get better, but as soon as they are over I just go back to my self destroying ways. I don’t usually hurt myself, although lately whenever I am feeling super depressed I’ve sometimes been hitting myself on the forehead just so that I can feel something. I’ve gone to school about 3 days in the past month, none of them consecutively. I eat pretty much only junk, with not a vegetable in sight. I want to get help, but I have closed myself off to sharing my interests and thoughts, even though my parents have always been supportive.

62,"Sorry if the title is a bit confusing. 
I feel like I’m in a constant state of sadness, no matter where I am, what I do, what hobbies I’m doing, what lifestyle I do/change. 

A bit of a backstory;
I’ve ALWAYS been such a hyperactive person. 
I’m a very happy-go-lucky person. 
An up-spirited person. 
An optimist. 
A ‘see the good in everything’ type of person. 

I don’t know if personality types come into play here, but for reference I’m an INFP if you believe in that. 

I’ve suffered through severe depression when I was in my early/late teens (I’m 22 now) and that was as far as that went. 
My parents had depression, and so do my brothers. So it runs in the family. 
But they have never had it severely. 

Anything that could make me feel sad, like a suppressed memory or something like that I am good at dealing with or I have gotten over through past therapy and such. 

However the sadness I’m constantly feeling has no relation to anything, it’s just.. there? It’s like it’s sitting dormant in the background. 

I like to travel a fair bit, and everywhere I go it’s always creeping back on me when I’m alone, or when I’m hanging with new people. It’s driving me crazy. 

I don’t need anti-depressants, I’ve never had them. It’s not that deep anymore. I’m still an energetic character but I keep finding myself feeling down all the time. No matter what I’m doing/who I’m with. 

I’ve gotten into reading, meditation, changing my music, cutting out my music, listening to podcasts, getting fit (consistently this time), being single, having a satisfying job, but it keeps creeping on me no matter what I seem to do or change.

How do I get over this?
I’m on holiday and it’s ruining it for me. 

Just for reference I don’t drink, smoke or do any sort of drugs. Never have so it wouldn’t even be a ‘come down’ period either. 

TLDR; always feeling sad despite lifestyle changes, what can I do?",07Nov2019,1
63,"Porn damages mental health but nowadays we see nudity and arousing content all over the internet, like IG models, nude models, celebrities. We see a lot of internet sources posting images of semi-nude or almost nude women/men in specifically arousing clothes/position/surroundings. There are tons of IG accounts, subreddits, twitter accounts and many other sources showcasing such content and we as a generation have grown addict to porn and such type of content.   
But this kind of content isn't specifically porn but it is arousing for most of us, so does that harm your meltal health or general health in any way?

I'm in the US, she's in the UK. We're trying to find her a therapist, but it's a lot harder to find one and the free healthcare over there isn't the best for this sort of thing. Something needs to be done though, and if I can help in anyway I will. I was wondering if there is possibly some coping exercises we can both do or some kind of work book we could do together? Her seeing a face to face therapist currently isn't looking very promising and I just know we have to get the ball rolling on this.

If anyone has any suggestions for doing guided at home therapy or something along those lines (books, videos, etc.) then I'm all ears.

67,"I have a lot of anxiety and depression problems and I’m starting to think maybe ptsd as crazy as it sounds, from a hard life lived and a rough upbringing. 

Lately I’ve been having trouble sleeping and eating. Ive lost 25lbs since September and I’ve been paranoid a lot and seems like my mind never has a shut off point. I lay in bed all night trapped in my head thinking, thinking, thinking. Even after working a very hard 12-14 hour day I can’t sleep at night time. 

My original coping mechanism was Valium (prescribed by a doctor for anxiety) and alcohol (I know what you’re all going to say about that one). 

But I find myself lately sitting in the garage, thinking about my fucked up life, drinking and smoking my pipe (tobacco) or cigarettes and just, trapped in my head. I go to work and work all day and it seems to be the only time I get relief.

I used to be able to sleep ok despite all the shit going on upstairs. I used to be able to take my Valium, drink a little, and go to bed. 

Lately I’ve been taking my Valium as prescribed and taking lyrica (prescribed for back pain, only occasionally) but nothing relieves the pressure in my head. Not even alcohol anymore. 

I used to be able to drink myself to sleep and I can’t do that anymore. I used to be able to take my meds and sleep and eat ok and I can’t do that either. I used to be able to work myself half to death and shut down, and that isn’t working either. 

Can anybody help me? My mind is running haywire. I can’t eat or sleep or even really hold a train of thought anymore. I can work and do my job good but I’m so fatigued all the time. Right now I’m dead tired after a 12 hour shift, I’ve had a few drinks of gin and my 15mg of Valium, and I’ve also taken 250mg of lyrica for my back pain which has flared up again. Any normal person would be completely unconscious by now. 

Help me please? Is there anything over the counter I can take? I get plenty of exercise and I have hobbies but my mind won’t leave me alone. 

Tl;dr - nobody will probably answer this. I’ve been having unreal amounts of anxiety lately. My regular coping mechanisms aren’t working and I need some real rest. I haven’t rested or eaten right in months and I’m so tired, but sleep always eludes me.",07Nov2019,1

69,"I recently lost my whole life.


My girlfriend and I were engaged. We hand a child together.


She started suffering from a mental illness or it became more obvious a year ago when she started to think the neighbours where spying on her. She insisted they were being paid off by the government to perform behavioural experiments on her. She eventually made it impossible to live in our house and made us move because she refused to talk in the house believing the neighbours were recording her. She put towels around the skirting board to stop what she called “the gasses” from getting in the house. She believed these gasses where controlling her, she insisted these gasses where overwhelming but nobody else could smell anything at all. She also insisted she saw people following her in public and “sprayed gasses” at her in public.


This isn’t her real name but I’ll refer to my girlfriend as “V” to make this story easier to write.


I tried to get V to see a doctor but she refused as she thought doctors were in on the conspiracy against her.


We moved house to escape her suspicions of the neighbours. We were in the new house for a week and she started saying “they found me”, she then proceeded to start putting towels around the skirting board just like the old house. I had to physically stop her.


V then started begging me not to leave her. Saying I was the best thing that ever happened to her and her son who I had been raising as a step child for 3 years. Her previous relationship was abusive and resulted in her child. The child has no contact with his biological father, as he is a complete monster. I have raised the child from the age of 3, he calls me dad now. I told her I loved her and her son and that I would do anything for her.

I never asked my son to call me Dad. he used to  call me by my first name. But one day he asked me to be his dad. I was so proud of myself. this tiny man trusted me enough to ask me to be his dad. It was one of the happiest moments of my life.


V then asked me to have another child. I wanted to say yes as it is something we always talked about and wanted. However I knew there was something wrong with her mental health and I couldn’t say yes. V was under so much stress already. I told her it just wasn’t the right time. I think I broke her heart.


I got her to see a specialists doctor a couple of months later, I thought this was a positive step. However 2 days later she kicked me out of our house and told me she didn’t love me anymore.


She went on to tell me that because I didn’t believe her about the gasses and how I refused to have a child with her she said she stopped loving me.


Naturally I was devastated.


I moved back in with my parents.

she told me it's be easier if I never saw my son again. this was the hardest thing I've ever heard.

2 weeks went by and she asked me if I'd like to look after her son on weekends as she works part time at the weekends. I jumped at the chance to see my son again.


I few weeks went by I saw our son on weekends as I see him as my own son and I love being a father. She texted me at one point and asked to get back together, by the time I got to see her the next morning she had changed her mind.


I then got a call from V’s therapist who said I needed to go see V immediately. I left work and raced over to the flat we once shared. She had written a suicide note and allowed me to read it. In the note she confessed to have been seeing somebody else while we were together. I told her I just wanted her to be happy and I left her on good terms. This hurt a lot as I really love her and our son. I couldn’t understand how she could do this to our family.


Another couple of weeks went by and I received another call from my ex’s therapist saying I needed to go pick up my son from school as V had a suicide attempt. She was taken to a mental health facility locally.

both these call were during the day so I had to leave work to deal with the situation.


She requested I visit her almost every day she was there. I love her so naturally I went to see her to keep her company. While she was there she told me what happened with her suicide attempt. She explained to me how she believed she had multiple personalities in her head.


There were 3 personalities, they are as follows


Venessa – a sadistic dark haired version of herself, who seemed to enjoy causing V pain.

Ben – an ex-husband of hers (she has never been married in real life)

The Mother – a protective personality that was there for her as her real mother was abusive to her.


V made a few references to a man she referred to as “the man that loves me”. I asked if this man was her new boyfriend, she replied with “can’t say” she went on to refer to this man as “the homewreaker”. So had a pretty good idea that he was her new boyfriend.


While she was in the hospital I talked to the mother character/personality very briefly via text message. In the text message the mother told me to protect her daughter from this man as he is a manipulative bastard. V herself said the homewreaker “didn’t even have the balls” to come and see her on the ward.


I then started to suspect that this “homewreaker” person might not actually have any tangible existence as a few things she said didn’t make sense. She didn’t know what he looked like but she said she spent every night with him. She didn’t know his name and insisted he would make a good father to her son.


While V was in hospital she described has she was raped multiple times throughout her childhood. she explained how the personalities helped her through all the abuse. I always knew she had a difficult childhood but I had no idea how bad it was until this moment.


I asked V if this new boyfriend was actually real of if her was another personality. She seemed confused and froze for a second and replied with “I hope not, because he is nice”. She was discharged from the hospital and diagnosed with PTSD induced Psychosis caused by her extreme child abuse.


She told me her 3 extra personalities had been destroyed but wouldn’t say how or why.


V asked me to leave again so I did.


I left and spent the next few weeks at my parents, occasionally V would ask me to spend the evening at her house as our her son missed me. I jumped at the opportunity because I love the pair of them and desperately want us to be a family again. V’s son always asked his mum if we can be a family again but she never answers his question. instead she just ignores him when he asks her.


One day I ignored V’s text messages to me throughout the day.

I was trying to concentrate at work. She asked me to go visit her but I told her I was busy as I was going to my own doctor as this whole experience was starting to take it’s tole on me as I was very confused and I had nobody to talk to. I lied to V and told her I had a driving lesson.


Later that evening at about 8:00 when I finally got home from the doctor, V messaged me saying “why didn’t you come today”, “I needed you”, “you let me down” and started asking me to look after our son after she herself was dead. I panicked and called her but she never picked up the phone. I raced over to her house. I burst trough the door she ran over and hugged me. I started talking to her, she was drunk. She explained how she’d taken 4 full packets of paracetamol and had drunk 4 cans of jack Daniels I called an ambulance and we spent all night in A&amp;E. she told me how much she’d missed me and how she needed me. I took her home once I knew she was safe to leave the hospital. I put her to bed and I slept on our son’s bed as I’d gotten my parents to take him away for the evening while we were in the hospital.


I told V that I was going to stay with her as I didn’t want to leave her alone. I told my father about what happened and her just reacted by yelling at me. This scared V. the next day when she finished at her work she disappeared. I couldn’t find her. I called her and she started talking about dying again, she refused to tell me where she was so I called the police. The police found her near a train station as I told them V had mentioned wanting to jump in front of a train.


I calmed V down and spent the next week with her. I told her I still loved her and tried to rekindle our past love but she heavily rejected me.


She then finally told me who her new boyfriend was.


He is a man named Tom. But she also told me that he once raped her and how she is scared of him. She builds a barricade in front of her front door every night. Which I of course I was highly suspicious of already.


This man named Tom doesn’t exist as far as I an tell. He appears to only exist in her head but I have no idea how. She said he is different from the 3 personalities as they where a part of her and Tom was an entirely different person.


She told me that Tom had “destroyed” her 3 extra personalities while she was in hospital, which made her lonely. V also said how she was scared of him but still explained how she loved him.


I am very confused by all this and even had suicidal thoughts myself. A few weeks ago I was picked up by the police while attempting to throw myself off a bridge. I was really low and I didn’t see a way out. I just want all this to stop.


I hate what my life has become.


I don’t know what is happening.


My whole family has been destroyed be this mental illness.


I want the woman I loved back. I want my some back and I want our lives back.

I got low again one night and I was detained by police officers for trying to kill myself again. this was all a desperate cry for help in hindsight. I spent the night on suicide watch and was unable to attend work. I discharged myself the next day against medical advice. I handed my boss the note explaining where I was and I was fired the next day.

everyone has turned there back on me. my family, my friends, my employer and even the woman who loved me.

The only person who loves me is my son. But I can't be his father from a distance.

I just want to be a family again.


I want to help her.

First off I'm an 18 year old girl going to college unlike most lucky kids I dont have a healthy family my dad is aggressive he used to beat me and my mom when I was a kid he doesn't do it anymore however everytime I have a conversation with him I feel like I'm walking on eggshells if I say something he doesn't like or want to hear he starts to make assumptions claiming that I hate him or I want to get rid of him, he would tell me that I'm nothing without him and that no one will ever love me outside of this family.
As for my mom she lives in her own little bubble and refuses to see any issue with anything, anytime me or my brother struggle with something emotionally she would tell us to ignore it and would refuse to hear us out.beacause my mom was neglecting our mental health my brother has a hard time expressing himself and almost never tells me what's bugging him when it's obvious he is struggling with something he stays quiet instead and acts like nothing happened the next day.
To be honest I don't genuinely like my parents the only reason Im convincing myself I like them is cause well..they are my parents, i feel stressed around them, I feel small, i feel like I'm nothing and I don't want them in my life anymore if i ever get a job,get married and have kids in the future

I'm not sure if I *can* not tense up, or if I just think I can, since the urge is so strong that I just, it's like I *have* to do the tensing up, there's just this completely overwhelming need to do it. 
And the thing is, it doesn't even happen on my bad days, one happened today but I felt fine the whole day. The only thing that's been off is lately I've been feeling more anxious than usual but I'm not sure why. 
I would just really like to know if this happens to anyone else because it's really distressing and I just want some answers if any one else knows why it might be happening, or to at least know I'm not alone in this.

75,"I have worked as an in-home therapist for 1.5 years. My job entails 4 hours of therapy per week, per client, with a current caseload of 10 clients, however, this is not feasible for numerous reason and only 1/4 of my caseload is consistent to meet that often/long. This setting allows for me to transport clients in my own car, which I have always hated but sucked it up. They expect me to respond to crisis calls at anytime of which grants my clients access to my personal number. Documentation must be done within 72 hours or 6:00AM the following Monday. I am required to meet a minimum of 90 billable hours per month. This does not include drive time (except if transporting a client) or documentation, therefore, I am always getting asked about not meeting the minimum 90. I have been warned that if I continue to not meet my hours I will be dropped to hourly pay which would cut my pay significantly. I have told my supervisor (who is aware of personal details and is very supportive) that if they do I will quit. I also document through my personal computer while at home and calls to other client providers are no longer deemed billable by our contractor. In the culture I practice in, it is very normal and encouraged that we buy clients food from our own pockets, despite not being reimbursed. The only reimbursement I receive is through mileage claims I submit on a monthly basis.

Here is what led me to wanting to quit: A recent crisis event appeared to have exacerbated my mental health (major depression) and I requested time off. Within the two days I requested with my PTO, I could not take advantage of since I engaged in back and forth calls and emails, of which I of course will not be paid for. This included a care coordinator asking me to attend a court hearing despite knowing I requested extended medical leave. This is when I had the idea to quit without the two-week notice given my current mental status as it is clear the culture in this setting is toxic. I had a severe breakdown this weekend and I dread the thought of going back to work. I obtained a doctor’s note stating that I will follow up with my PCM/PCP soon for further recommendations and have missed several weeks of work the last few months, so they know I have health concerns, despite not knowing exact details.

I feel as if my whole identity revolves around this job as I am a military spouse and hardly know anyone here. It is obvious as to why there is such a high turnover rate. Despite all of this, I still feel “scared” over quitting and guilt about going about it this way, but deep down I know it’s what’s best. The only relief is knowing that I can get a guaranteed recommendation by my direct supervisor and outside supervisors that track my clinical LCSW hours, as they are aware of my good reputation at work.

I'm really in dark place right now and I feel like I got nowhere to escape and I just want tthe pain to go away. I was never officially diagnosed with any mental issues but from perspective of time I think I've had a problem for good 15 years. All this time I felt like I don't belong and simple social situation scared me. But last 2 years have been horrible for me. I didn't get a first proper girlfriend until I was 26 and than after 3,5 years together she left me. That destroyed me. Sometime after that I found a girl that felt really good around me so I pursuited romantic relationship with her but after initial intrest she basically friendzoned me and destroyed rest of my self-esteem whatsoever. All this put me in major depression and constant shame and guilt. I finally realised that I have mental problems that are holding me down from living happy life. I registered myself for therapy but I have to wait sometime until I get a counsellor since it's budget friendly option.

Well now that his gotten to know me after the hype of finding each other I can sort've sense that it's going down hill. He's really busy which I understand that but it's getting to a point where I feel like I'm annoying him when I message him or try to call him. 

Today I'm at this point where I just want to stop caring and just give up on the whole situation and just go back to being in my bubble of just me and the kids, and not worrying about if I'm screwing things up.

Usually if I am in this situation with anyone id just block them and immediately feel better that I don't have to deal with feeling like that, I already tried to do this with him when we first started to getting to know each other because I didn't really think he was that interested in me but he tracked me down and really made a point of how his got anxiety about losing people he's close to and that's why I think I've fallen for him. I always just assume I annoy people.

I'm really sick of feeling like the way I do though. I'm one of the impulsive kind who can't really just let things lie, I always need to be vocal or it builds up and I just get really miserable. I don't want to talk to him about this at all because I know it'll just turn into a fight and I'll feel even worse because I'm being the crazy one over thinking everything. I don't want to feel hurt like that. 

Also Im really sick of the fact, in every relationship that ends that im so predictable that when I do end something with someone theyre pretty shocked. Why do I need to get walked all over to a point where I say nope, not dealing with this shit anymore. See u later. Why can't they reassure me? That i do mean something? Or end it themselves? Why do they have to get angry with me. Why do people just put up with me?

Same goes with friendships. I've had 2 friends in the past who pissed me off that damn much while I had a boyfriend, flirting with them and wearing short skirts and dresses I'd never seen on them before only when visiting me and boyfriend's house. Flirting with them infront of me. Thinking oh this is fun, I'm pissing her off when I never did this with any of their partners. If anything I wouldn't talk to them much at all. Why do I need to get to a point where i literally have to piss someone off that damn much to stay out of my life? 

I'm just jack of people at the moment. Seriously

TL;DR - I think I've stuffed things up with boyfriend because I feel like I'm annoying him all the time. I'm down about myself because I don't get people. I just want to hide in my bubble and go back to not dealing with anyone",07Nov2019,1

And i gotta tell you my first year with the constant unbearable pressure and massively studying relieved me more than gaming could ever do. But now it's wearing out and I don't want it to. Suicide is against my principles this is why I could make it till today. I can't afford or have the time for therapy, and even if I did, I probably won't because at this point it's either too late or needs years of effort to get some progress and I have no will to do that.

87,"Hello, first post in years so sorry for my lack of reddit etiquette.

Me and my girlfriend have been in a long distance relationship for over 3 years and we met in college.  Soon after we started dating her mental health declined and she has been out of school since, moving back to her home state which isn't ridiculously far from me, and i left school also due to family related issues. We stuck together through her hospitalizations, I visited whenever I could, but she was never allowed to visit me. Understandable, her parents are worried for her safety, but shes allowed to go out to bars (more on this later). I tried bringing the conversation up about her coming to visit for the day about two weeks ago (mind you her parents always acted very accepting of me and seemed to love having me around) and her parents became extremely defensive, saying its not safe for her to come here, but they allow her to go to bars with strangers knowing she has problems resisting alcohol (she considers herself an alcoholic). This made no sense to me, as her parents claim they want to protect her but allow her to go to bars well into the night, and not even allow her to visit me for an afternoon. After we had a long, long conversation about how I feel she should be able to visit by now, things blew up, her parents kept saying no and she cut herself out of anger and frustration. Her parents don't want us dating right now, they made us take a break for three months, and she blocked me on all social media. We have a mutual friend who is more like a father figure to both of us, and he told me i deserved to know that she is flirting with other guys when we agreed to be loyal during this break, as it was less of a break and more a forced separation. I have been loyal and im hurt but i understand that with her mania she does things that she normally wouldn't do. I can move past this. What i cant figure out is if what her parents are doing is considered abuse, and if anything can be done to help her (also we are adults, not minors if that wasn't obvious). Her mother is extremely critical, constantly asks my girlfriend if she is pregnant because her medications make her weight fluctuate, and withholds affection like a punishment. I've experienced it first hand during our visits, and from conversations with my girlfriend. Her dad doesn't seem to do anything except help my girlfriend sneak unhealthy food under her mothers nose, while never speaking up about how she constantly picks on my girlfriends weight. One visit she nearly slapped a pad of butter out of her hand because she wanted to try some in her oatmeal, like i was having. Our mutual friend who told me about the flirting is well above our age and is basically the first person i go to for any advice lately. He thinks this is abuse as well, but doesn't seem to think we can do anything since she is not a minor. She is diagnosed with Bipolar 1 but a lot of her symptoms don't seem to match up with what i have read, but also i'm not a medical professional so i cant really say. The bottom line is, her parents are extremely critical (well her mom more so), they are forcing her to take a break from dating me (apparently just me) for 3+ months (she did not want a break either, at least that's what she told me when we last spoke), the mother constantly makes remarks about her weight like ""to be skinny is to be hungry, you need to be hungry!"" basically promoting eating disorders in someone who already has problems with their self image, her mom had extreme anger issues when she was a child and my GF would lock herself in her room out of fear until her father came home, and having inconsistent arbitrary rules for her life (like how she can go to bars while they know she has urges to drink but cannot visit her boyfriend of almost 3 years in a safe, quiet neighborhood. I'm hoping someone can give me advice, i'm planning on driving up there in a couple of weeks to talk to her, just not sure how it will go. They dont want me going but i know an event shes going to. I dont want to break up, I want to help her and to me, to our mutual friend, and multiple other mutual friends, her parents are extremely over controlling for someone her age. Oh, and when she was in college her parents made her switch therapists because the therapist refused to do exactly what the parents wanted. So they made her see someone else who she didnt even like and boom, she ends up having to leave school because she hurts herself because she didnt want to talk to that therapist. They also forced her to sign release forms so that her therapists can basically tell them everything about each session. It just seems like abuse to me and I want to know if there is something I can do to help her get out of that environment or at least show her that her parents aren't really helping her condition. It's almost as if they are exploiting her mental illness to keep the reigns on their adult child. Also, if you havent guessed like many people with bipolar she is on and extreme cocktail of antidepressants, anti psychotics, 2 types of benzos and a slew of other drugs that havent really helped her at all these past 3 years, only became more sedated and willing to do anything her parents asked of her. Is this abuse? is there anyway I can help an adult child with a mental disorder who is being emotionally abused by her mother, and to a lesser extent her father for allowing her to sneak behind her mothers back only making things worse for her?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My GF of 3+ yrs who lives out of state with her parents can't speak to me for three months all because i asked for her to visit for the day, and her parents told her she needs to take a break from our relationship out of the blue. I was literally at there house playing board games with the whole family not a week before this all happened. They have inconsistent rules like letting her go to bars unattended knowing she 1) can't drink on her medicine and 2) she is an alcoholic (had to get stomach pumped and had extreme internal bleeding at 15 i believe) but she cannot visit me because its an ""unsafe environment"". Her mother is snarky and mean to her, makes fun of her weight, and generally acts emotionless towards my GF. Is there anyway I can help her? Is this abuse? She is diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and it seems a lot like they are exploiting her mental state to get her to do as they want. She's an adult, but can something be done to get her out of there because she doesn't have the mental capacity to see the damage they're doing to her?

&amp;#x200B;

just another quick note, her whole family basically excommunicated her cousin for being a lesbian, so you can imagine the fear she has trying to express herself to her parents. Shes terrified of them throwing her out on the street for standing up for herself and what she wants, or to even come out as bi to them.

Since I got got here my mental health has continued to decline. I thought I would make friends here pretty quickly because I have never had issues with that. I haven't made any real friends here though, I've now spent three months in near total isolation. I used to be quite an outgoing person but as I go longer with no one else by my side I have become more and more awkward. A huge part of my personality is joking around, in fact I would say it is the central part of my personality. Last week I was thinking about why I feel so unhappy and something I realized is that I have stopped making jokes. I have no one to talk and the few people I can talk to don't really seem to like my humor. Having no one else in my life is giving me anxiety about wasting time here and I have been slowly losing hope that things will ever get better. It's weird because intuitively I know things will get better, but I have started second guessing myself and asking ""ya but what if they don't"". I know it is stupid but I have lost everything that was important and enjoyable to me. I can't have a car here, my family and friends are a 14 hour time difference away.

At this point I dont know if I'm one of those 14 yr old girls who tell people they are depressed because they think its quirky. And that sucks. Because I dont even know if only wanting to die when Im sad or when Im having bad days is because I have depression or if its just a side effect of being exposed to so much media coverage on mental health issues.

I dont really know if that makes sense but what Im trying to say is that I dont know if I would feel the urge to cut if I didnt know what cutting was. 

Dont know if it matters but I have never cut. There have been times when Ive pressed blades against my wrists but the most I've done is scratched at the first layer of skin.

Note- Ive never told anyone that ""Im depressed"". Because I dont know if I actually am. I'm just adding that on so I can let myself believe that I have one less thing in common with people who fake depression to get attention.

92,"I (22F) suffer from both anxiety and depression. Recently I was signed off work with work related stress after telling my doctor that I couldn't stop crying whilst at work and wanted to hurt myself during my breaks. I was signed off immediately for two weeks (a timeframe I chose thinking it was all I needed).
 
During those two weeks my mental health has dipped drastically however my sick notes runs out today. I recieved a message from my line manager (the main reason I'm off with stress) who said I either needed to get a new sick note or come in tomorrow. I immediately rang the doctors and extended my sick note.

Although I'm relieved I do not have to face work just yet the guilt I feel is tremendous. I know I am not mentally fit to go back to work however I feel like I'm letting my parents down. I feel guilty that im not mentally capable of just getting on in my job. I feel guilty that whilst im not at work I appear happier because I am not at the place that was causing me stress. I feel like a fraud and a fake and worry others will see me that way. And yet the thought of going back to work makes me feel sick.

My parents don't yet know that I've extended my sick note for another two weeks. I'm scared to tell them because of the guilt I feel.

97,"I’m 16, male and live in Kent, England. 

For the last 6 years, I’ve been taking care of my mum, who has hypothyroidism. She loses her hair a lot, but last year she finally managed to keep a full head of hair for about six months. I was delighted, so was she, but now we are back where we started, me coming home from school, and having to comfort her. She’s unemployed at the moment, she used to be a teacher but the stress got too much. It’s not that I don’t care about my mum, but sometimes I just wish she would get better or get over it. It’s something I have to keep dealing with, I haven’t been on holiday for 3 years because she feels self conscious. 

Anyway, that’s only part of the problem. 

With my friends, I’m probably the loudest, chattiest one. With other people I’m the quiet, boring one. I’m also very self conscious even though I have no reason to be, I go to the gym so am pretty fit and toned, yet I shy away from girls. My problem is talking to people. I can’t seem to do it unless I’m forced to, but when that happens I’m completely fine, confident and funny. 

About a month ago this hot girl replied to one of my Instagram stories and we got talking. We get the same bus but we had never talked, and I enjoyed talking to her. Every day that I see her, I smile, she smiles back but I don’t usually get the chance to talk to her, either because I’m with someone else or we have to rush off the bus. This one time however, I was alone and catching the bus home. I didn’t notice her until I got on and i thought “this is my chance, go sit next to her” since she was also alone. 

But instead I sat in the seat in front for some reason, and I almost talked to her. I took off my headphones, turned my body but, I just couldn’t. I spent the whole bus ride in that position, and I could tell she wanted me to talk to her (I guess she is shy as well). And since then I’ve been beating myself up about it. I feel like I wasted it and I’ve been trying to find chances like that again, but am failing so far. I find myself avoiding opportunities like that, like noticing her before I get on the bus, and waiting for the next one. 

I’ve never had any real female friends or girlfriends, and it’s really soul crushing to know that it’s my fault. Even at school, I only have two classes with girls in them, and that is a total of 3 girls that I can talk to. None of them are people I would be friends with though, and since I’m in sixth form at an all-boys school, girls are rare to see (the sixth form let’s in some girls, but it’s never more than 65:35 ratio of boys to girls. 

And I want to talk to people, because I know once I do i will be back to my confident funny self, but I just can’t. I get girls I don’t know complimenting me and I don’t know how to carry on the conversation other than saying “thanks, you look great too” etc.  

Outside of school I’m an air cadet, and we meet on Tuesday and Friday nights. No one there is my age really, except for some annoying people form my school. I’m not that interested in going anymore, because of how strict it has got over nothing. I think I have a problem with authority too though. I can’t tell my parents this though because they don’t listen to me when I say these kind of things. They’re great  parents, don’t get me wrong, but they don’t understand when I don’t want to continue doing something, even if I have good reasons. It took me 6 months to convince them to let me quit explorers (next level from scouts). 

Me and my friends were split up into different classes form the start of the year, and now I barely see them. At the moment I’m talking to some people who I used to be friends with, but moved on because they were (and still are) immature. 

Tl;Dr

My mums condition, my inability to approach people, my lack of people I can talk to, and lack of friends are bringing me down. 

I don’t expect many responses but I just needed to get this out because it feels better to tell someone.

103,"hi everyone, i hope none of my classmates or anyone from my family sees this. 

to begin, i’m a fifteen year old student from the PH. I’m known to be very cheerful and loud by my friends and family, I’m also very motherly and supportive towards my friends and get attached easily. Whenever someone needs help, I’m there for them. Won’t leave them until they’re happy.

For as long as I remember, when I was in grade school (specifically 5th to 6th grade) I was being isolated and bullied by my classmates, I’ve been called names and called out for my appearance and teeth. I told my family about this, (I have an older sister and she always says I’m ugly, unattractive, useless and stupid) and my parents talked to the head of the school about it. Which made problems worse, people began isolating me, my grades flunked, and I just lost a chance to study in one of the prestigious schools in the Philippines in the same year that happened. My self-esteem is very low, I always worry constantly about my appearance and what other people think and say about me. I’m always nervous about what they’re saying.

Now, I’m in 9th grade. Been going through some changes since 7th grade, I’ve changed; A LOT. However, I’ve been bullied and isolated yet again in 7th grade and gained some friends during 8th and 9th grade, my grades are high and my reputation is clean. 

Then, it came back. Everyday since 6th grade I’ve been having thoughts about suicide, though, this became less in 8th grade but came back again this year. And this time, it’s more louder and ever. I ended up hurting myself. Which, I never did before. 

I thought it was a one-time thing, I thought it was because I was going through puberty and it was just normal sadness. No big deal. But then, it became so evident I hardly get any schoolworks done. I worry about my performance in school daily, I can’t get any sleep from constant worrying and thinking, I easily cry and snap at people, I want to be alone. But whenever I’m alone, these thoughts seem to get the best of me. 

Whenever I’m above ground, I always look down and instead of admiring the view, I think of ‘if I jump down there, am I dead?’ It’s so tempting. All of my history tabs are full of ‘suicide’ and ‘depression’ stuff. I don’t have depression and I won’t say until I officially get diagnosed, so far, I’m just sad.

I think this came from being sad for so long, I felt trapped in my own mind that I wanted to escape, no matter how many times I rung the suicide hotline, the guilt, the stress, the sadness and the pain will always come back after. So, the only way to get out is by death. I had 3 suicide attempts, the 3rd one being earlier this May when I got so sad because of my family issues. 

I don’t tell anyone that I’ve been craving death or been sad, that’s not my agenda since people always think I’m supposed to be happy, if they find out what’s underneath my smile they’ll leave. Like everyone I used to be friends with.

The world is so colorless and dull to me, I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel so alone and trapped. I have no one to tell this but the internet.",07Nov2019,1

I dislike both of my step-parents however was sadly subjected to an abusive stepfather through my early teen years. I managed to run away to live with my father however also did not get on with his wife, who treated me as if I didn't exist in their household alongside my brothers. Ever since then, I have confided in my grandparents who have essentially brought me up and acted as the father/mother figure in my life (fathers parents). 

I am now almost at the point of graduation from university which I have attended for almost 4 years, and I am slowly becoming less and less affiliated with my parents. During these times of little communication, my health seems to pick up and I feel like I can almost cope as a normal human. However, during my second year of uni, my bad taste in men 'blessed' me with a boyfriend (26m) who thought I would benefit from being told I was fat and could do with dropping a few dress sizes. Since then, I have sadly developed an eating disorder alongside having previous mental health issues and my life started to spiral out of control a bit. I confided in my parents out of the blue and they tried to pull me out of university and away from my friends who i consider to be almost like a second family to me. Ever since then, they have started treating me like a child, trying to force me to come home and spend time with them, do as they wish, my dad has often asked me if i 'love coming home' to which in guilt I say yes, but in truth I just want to be as far away from my step-mother as I can get. I love my dad, for the most part, he is caring and we have a great time together when we are on our own, I just feel so uncomfortable when my step-mother is there. They want me to move home after university, but I really couldn't think of anything worse, but I have no idea what to do. I want to keep the peace but I also feel like I am at war with myself because I don't feel I am old or wise enough to make a drastic decision with my parents (wether cutting them off, or telling them how I really feel). I am almost (but not quite) financially stable on my own yet, I have a very employable degree and have a couple of job options lined up for me once I graduate. I will be taking one of those options based around a couple of social factors to do with friends and my current partner (this is someone different to previously mentioned boyfriend), I just don't know how to tell my parents. My mental health is so fragile that one day I can be a right as rain, the next I can be a mess, and I am tired, I just want it all to go away and get on with my life, I really don't have time to be ill any more. What makes matters worse is recently my father reached out to ask if my company (my job) could assist him with some business matters. My boss kindly said we could take him on as a client to help out, however my dad has missed appointments with no warning to me or anyone in my company which has led to me having to apologise on behalf of my dad to my boss. It makes me feel so embarrassed and as if I am wasting my boss' time. I confronted my father on this which ended up leading me to tears as he turned the whole thing round on me to stop pestering him as he is having a really hard time at home. 

I'm just not sure what to do, I feel my anxiety is consuming me and ruining the valuable relationships I have with people. I can't sleep, I'm losing weight, I just want this to end but I can't see an end in sight. I just want to be better.",07Nov2019,1
107,"The last year has been hell and university has done everything in its power to make it even worse. Yesterday all social media was filled in my class graduating besides me. I’ll be honest it broke me seeing them all so happy with their degrees while I probably won’t because staff picked me to fail. 

I know a lot will think “they can’t do that” or whatever but for months now they keep emailing me to accept I failed and they refuse to help. There’s a lot of details I won’t say for personal reasons but they are doing everything they can to try and put me in more debt.

And it started yesterday and it stopped for a bit and I still have it now. I did not sleep through the night. I was lying down posting on reddit and looking through it as well and thinking about death. Anyway getting to the point; I keep twitching and repeating words in my head. As I am writing this a single word will get stuck in my head and i'll just repeat it for a bit. And a bit ago I just started jerking my head and I told myself, as I always tell myself when this happens, ""just stop it you can control it you're just being crazy"" and i stop it but then I'll do it again. Also, I've noticed that my feet and hands will also twitch occasionally but more slightly. And I can't breathe and I'm shivering. I try to look around and say in my head what's around me ""door, table, chair"" but it just reminds me of how im still in this world and its not worth it and how at the same time i dont know if i want to leave but i just want it all to stop. help.",07Nov2019,1
112,"Quick background. I got anxiety and panic disorder symptoms 3 months ago because I started a small business using all my and my parents money and everything that can go wrong with it went wrong. Now it’s doing ok enough to survive but I’m working 80 hours a week without pay, 60 hours at my business and another 20 doing another job earning money to cover for some of my business expenses. 

Panic attacks and anxiety caused my health to drop drastically and after 2 months of learning to cope and fight against it I’ve gotten better. Panic attacks went from 5-8 times a day to only about once a week. I still get anxious and worried for no reason for at least a couple times a day. Everything seems like it’s getting better right?

No for some reason I’ve started to have suicidal thoughts. Why am I working like this? Nothing is getting better in life, I’m counting every second I have when I’m not working instead of enjoying them and resting. I have separations anxiety from my parents and my girlfriend because being with them calms me so now I feel like I can’t function without them. Why is life so hard to me? I’m worthless and I’m just waste of resources. I can’t stop or control my thoughts. Feels like I’m going down a dark path.

Sometimes it’s reasonable, other times it’s like wtf? It’s not even bad. I’m not sure how it started. I know I feel this way when looking at holes. This, I feel is rational. It makes my skin crawl and makes me feel really gross. But there are just random stuff that had made me feel this way and sometimes even worse. Like, my younger has really long coarse hair and sometimes it has been found in my clothes. Like her hair would be woven into the fabric which meant I had to pull it out. This made me feel overwhelmingly disgusting and I just feel so uncomfortable. I’ve felt this way with random things too.

117,"Idk if this belongs here but it ropes in with my mental health so??? If it doesn’t just let me know. I need opinions from strangers and not anyone that knows me so I can get honest answers. I’ll start from the beginning. Life was okay from when I can remember.  I don’t even really remember my parents being together because they broke up when I was like 2-3? Then at 3 my mom got with my now ex stepfather. Well that stepfather abused me sexually. My mom didn’t know until 11 years later. But throughout the 11 years I feel like she abused me as well but emotionally. Once my sister was born, 0 attention went to me. I also had a stepsister who my mother seemed to also favor over me. Throughout my life I’ve never really been her favorite. On my dads side I’m the only kid so that kind of made up for my affection-less other parent. But with being the “least favorite” at least how I saw it, I was always yelled at. When my mother yells at me I’m basically not allowed to say anything back or it gets worse. Or if she’s firmly telling me everything I’m doing wrong she gets upset if I speak back to her. Now let me say I am not yelling back I’m too afraid to do that I don’t raise my voice at her. She always finds reasons to yell at me but some of the reasons are valid. But I have serious problems opening up and speaking up when something is wrong. I can’t really tell if it’s from my mother constantly yelling at me and now allowing me a voice or from my stepfather. Or maybe both? But there’s this one time my mom asked me if my stepdad was doing things to me and of course 11 year old me lied and said “no why would he?” But I’m thinking on it now.... what made her ask? Did she know? Was she seeing signs and asking? I don’t really think it’s normal for a parent to check up and ask if a stepparent is abusing them unless they have a hunch or know. And anytime I bring up my abuse or speak on it she does make it about herself even though the only way it affected her was getting a divorce. She even used my case to keep my little sister. And she also knew about it like actually knew about it at the end and didn’t let me tell anyone for 2-3 months. He still somewhat lived there and still abused me. She didn’t know he still abused me because he “promised” not to do it again. Or at least I don’t think she knew....... And now she still tells me she made me wait because she didn’t know what to believe... I wasn’t the one that confessed my stepdad confessed saying he was abusing me..... I just can’t understand if she’s emotionally abusive or not. I moved out from her house 4 years ago to live with my nana. Then I ended up back at her house and she’s continuing the yelling at me over super small stuff and not letting me speak. And it’s not like I can talk to her about any of this because she gets super angry and then starts yelling. I haven’t tried in a long time because I just know what’s going to happen. I hate living here but idk what to do I really don’t I’m stuck so stuck.",07Nov2019,1
118,"I'm working on getting my depression treated, but in the meantime I just constantly feel miserable. A few drinks, and I feel good. I want to be able to feel good occasionally but I don't want to become alcoholic or anything.",07Nov2019,1
119,"This is mostly a vent I guess. I’m feeling very worn down right now. I have GAD and depression and am struggling to find the right meds. I’ve had anxiety for about six years but my mental health has gotten much worse in the past year after beginning to self medicate with alcohol.

This most recent health journey began in April. I got a counselor for the first time after the meds my GP gave me didn’t help my anxiety (Lexapro). He was not that helpful, but did suggested I see a psychiatrist and put the bug in my head that I should stop drinking. Psych diagnosed me with with BP NOS and put me on a med cocktail. after starting meds I started self harming, which she honestly didn’t really seem to care about. I had an unrelated allergic reaction but due to one of my meds (Lamictal), I came off two meds and went on two new ones. Still self harming and lots of anxiety.

My mom, partner, and new counselor though BP might not be a good fit. I decided with the support of my counselor to stop meds. Felt okay for a bit then anxiety worsened. Made an appt with a new doc who I just saw a couple weeks ago. He agreed BP was not a good fit and I started Sertraline and Klonopin.

I HATE KLONOPIN. It does help a lot of people so I was hopeful. It did not work at all for me. My doc just called in a prescription for Buspar to take along with Sertraline. 

And today I’m just feeling defeated. On my commute to work I was finding myself feeling jealous of people who have healthy brains. That’s not really fair since everyone has their own issues. But it’s crazy to meet that people are overwhelmed by guilt every time they make a decision. People don’t struggle to shower. People just have contentment. It’s wild.

Anyone else feel this way?

120,"I haven't been able to vent or rant to anyone about this, so this is going to be a long one. Thank y'all for bearing with me. 

The first thing I want to say is that I have a horrible habit of leaning on people. I'm currently in therapy for a lot of my mental health issues, and this has been a topic that has been discussed many times. We've both kind of come to the conclusion that this habit comes from my mom.

I havent had my mom around in a while. She's a very emotionally abusive person. Her and my dad got a divorce when I was 14 because of that abusive. She's been in and out of my life ever since. It's this fucked up cycle of her hurting me horribly, me shutting her out, me feeling so extremely guilty that I need to patch things up with her, and then it's back to square one. This last hurt was a bit too much, and after a very intense panic attack, I decided I couldn't have her in my life anymore. That was about January.

That messed me up pretty badly, not gonna lie. She's my mom. She's fucked me up good, but she's my mom. It's been months and there's still days where I break down because of the things she's said or done to me. 

So, there's one person out.

I love to do theatre. It's always been an outlet for me when it comes to my anxiety and depression. It's my passion and it honestly keeps me breathing. When one of my best friends told our little group of 4 that she was going to be directing one of our all time favorites, Heathers, we all flipped. I spent months rehearsing and building up my voice for the part of Veronica Sawyer, when in February, auditions were held. I got the part.

I was absolutely over the moon. I dove head first into the show and surrounded my life with it. Everything was great, until I had a falling out with one of my best friends, who was the director, and my other best friend, who was playing a part opposite of me.

Obviously, I want to keep things cool and professional. They had a different idea.

I was 18, and I had made a really stupid decision a few months back. I had taken some nude pictures to kinda help boost my self esteem and feel better about my body. Now that in itself is not bad. The bad thing was having my friends there taking them.

They showed the cast my nude pictures. They constantly berated me, using the things they knew about my anxiety and insecurities to break me down. I barely made it out of that show alive. That sounds overdramatic, but I cannot put into words how horrible I was treated and how horrible I felt. I almost killed myself during our opening weekend. 

I had trusted them both with so much, and they were more than mature enough to handle the situation better. The director was 27, and my fellow castmate was 21. I was 18. They knew about my panic attacks. They knew about my issues with my mother. They knew all of my insecurities and fears. And they used those things to make my life a living hell for about three months. 

There's two more down.

During this time, I got very close to an old friend of mine who had come to do fight choreography for the show. He's only a year older than me, and honestly, I'm so thankful for all that he did for me during the show. He helped me through many attacks and breakdowns. The night I tried to kill myself, he drove almost an hour to come stay with me. He was engaged at the time. His fiance hated me. I promise there was nothing romantic between us.

We got very close, to the point where I was constantly driving to his house and staying with him and a few of our other friends. They were my rocks for the summer. And then his fiance broke things off. 

He has always been an absolute ray of sunshine. Very big dad energy. Seeing him sent into this intense state of depression scared the shit out of me. I stayed with him constantly. I would drive an hour almost every day just to make sure he was okay. He needed me and I knew it. I was more than willing to be there for him. He slowly became one of my best friends, and I couldn't imagine losing him.

And then something happened. 

I had been staying with him for the night, just us two. We were goofing off per usual, being assholes to each other. We got into this serious conversation about him and his ex. He expressed how lonely he was and I tried to help him as much as I could. He started joking about kissing me, and I brushed it off, because I joke about that stuff with all of my friends. And then he started kissing my neck.

I automatically started having a panic attack and had to go outside to try and calm myself down. I hated myself for it, but I ended up leaving. I still hate myself for it. It really seemed selfish.

I brushed it off, knowing it was because he was lonely and in an absolutely horrible spot. He apologized and I told him multiple times not to. He just wasn't thinking things through.

Everything was fine until he got together with someone who's been my best friend since we were kids. 

He has completely shut me out and it hurts. He barely talks to me. I try my best to reach out, and nothing happens. I've been in one of the worst mental states of my life the past couple of months, and it sincerely feels like he doesn't care. It stings so bad sometimes I feel like it might make me vomit. I feel used. I feel like he emotionally used me, and then tossed me away when I needed him the most.

That makes three.

I mentioned having a best friend who's been in my life since we were kids who is now dating the guy I previously mentioned. I love her to death. She is always going to be in my heart. But I can't talk to her about anything anymore, mainly because I know she'll talk to him about it. Which in itself isn't a bad thing. There are just things I need kept between us. But that doesn't exist anymore.

Four.

I tried killing myself the other night. I've been self harming again. I feel utterly alone. I keep trying to tell myself that everything is going to get better, but it's difficult to keep that mindset up when it seems like everything is just set on making you break. 

The only people that keep me here are my father, brother, grandparents, and stepmom. They're kinda all I have right now, and I can't imagine hurting them by leaving. We've also got another little brother on the way. I really want to meet him.

Anyway, I just needed to put this out into the universe somewhere. The only person in my life I feel that would understand what I'm going through is my ex, and I'm terrified to open up old wounds. I miss him pretty badly though. Thank you for reading this. I hope you're having a beautiful day.",07Nov2019,1
121,"I just got of the phone again to my therapist and I'm just mad and depressed now. I've just gotten off another medication a couple weeks ago due to some nasty side effects (Wellbutrin if you're wondering) and have been trying to get in contact with the nurse's office there. Their communication absolutely sucks no matter how much I try to tell them the times they call me are impossible since I'm a student. When I do call (even during office hours), all I get is the answering machine and no call back or any communication about what they want me on next. They always say, stop taking it, report symptoms, we'll call you back with new information. I never get the call back and then my therapist asks how the new medication is and I have to tell her that I don't know what she is talking about. It was the same story about my first round where they never said anything about when I should start or that I even started until they asked how it was going because they asked me to get a blood test done. I felt like shit when I had to apologize about not understanding them that I was supposed to start because they way they communicated about it I had to wait until they got the bloodwork done. They discussed options rather than saying this is your prescription. I'm just done with this and done with them.

122," Not a sympathy post just a warning.. 
So I'm a 25 y/o M. Don't get loads of female attention and a few years ago I bagged myself my dream girl, we'll call her Mary. Mary was smart, had aspirations, goals,  proactive, easy going, genuine and beautiful but to top it all off the icing on the cake was that she was my best friends older sister.. (damnnn right?!). Somehow against all the odds she took a real liking to me. 

I'm your average skater boy: love punk rock, tattoos etc.. and Mary really was model material. Heads would turn and people would stare in the street because we really were the definition of opposites attract. The relationship was perfect, literally could not fault it, perfect! It was genuine happiness and it really did show! 

Just over a year later I was out in town and ran into my ex (we'll call her Sophie) who also happened to be my first true love. Intoxicated I stupidly agreed to go for a drink with her there and then but just for a catch up as friends. That's when all the pain and sorrow from the past came flooding back. My mental health deteriorated over the next few weeks and spiraled out of control to the point that I convinced myself that Mary was too good for me and it wasn't fair on her if she stayed with me: despite having NO REASON to actually do it.. (after all Sophie said she still loved me so its meant to be right?) As a result of not thinking straight for weeks and falling down the rabbit hole I broke up with Mary, convinced it was the right decision. Lots of tears and tension as you can imagine.. Soon after the realisation of what I had done hit me. I was so fucking deluded. 

Several months after I got back with Sophie thinking it was the right decision. You guessed it.. TOTAL DISASTER. We've been split up for about a year now and my mental health is the worst its been. I can't remember the last time I genuinely felt happiness and sense of wellbeing except for when I was with Mary. It tears me apart and eats away at me every day, the chances of getting someone else that makes me feel that way are looking slim to none. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is please please please just think EVERYTHING through and make sure you have a clear head before acting on something! Make sure that your head is straight and DO NOT RUSH anything guys.

129,"Just posting this here because I don’t know who to talk to. I’m sorry it’s long and I understand if you don’t read all of it. 

I’m currently in my first year university right now and I’m not doing so good. I have suffered with depression for awhile now. It all started around middle school when kids get a little bit more emotional and don’t know how to deal with their feelings. In my family, we don’t really talk about mental health and so I never told my parents and just dealt with it. I had suicidal thoughts then and used to self harm. My sister and I weren’t in good terms then so once she found out she told our parents. Our parents just sat me down and scolded me once and then they never brought it up. I think I stopped once I cut too deep and the scar didn’t heal as fast as what I was used to. Anyways I thought I was getting better and then I suffered with an eating disorder in highschool, bulimia to be exact. During that time I felt lost and insecure, I started not caring about school and avoided having to see anyone especially after having a binge-eating episode which was pretty frequent. I would even sometimes not go to class because of that. It was around grade 11 or 12 when I went and talked to my schools councillor. I opened up to her about my eating disorder and needless to say I only went to her once, although she saw me at school almost everyday, yet she didn’t try to reach out or see how I was doing. After that I feel stupid for opening up and embarrassed that I told someone. I used to be a student who was a high achiever and was known to get good grades in school and always happy and friendly with everyone but I had no motivation and I didn’t care during my senior year of highschool. In order to uphold the image that everyone saw of me, I tried finding loopholes. I resorted to cheating in order to keep my grades high and because I didn’t want to disappoint my teachers. I became something I wasn’t proud of. I made excuses about missing school and hanging out with friends. I felt guilty from deceiving them. Around this time, I had a mental breakdown and I wanted to try getting help again so I found a mental health worker in my area. It was going fine, I thought. I thought that I would finally be okay. I also started researching antidepressants do I went and booked a doctors appointment to talk to them. The first one prescribed me a one month of antidepressants and he said that it usually takes 4-6 weeks to see results and that seemed like a long time to me. I went and saw another doctor who gave me sleeping pills to help with my sleeping pattern and said that it will help me focus more during school. I felt like these two doctors didn’t really understand until I went and saw another doctor. She prescribed me antidepressants and along with the counselling sessions it’ was going good. My eating disorder almost completely went away. And although there were times where I would overeat, I never threw up. Anyways this went on for a few months and I was honestly happy. The main reason why I wanted to get help was because I didn’t want to be bringing this into university because I saw university as a fresh start. However towards the end of senior year, I relapsed. This relapse made me feel like I ruined all my progress and I disappointed my doctor and therapist. I was depressed and with the guilt on top of it, I missed my appointments with my mental health worker and just stopped going to her. She called me a couple of times and tried to reschedule an appointment but I made stupid excuses because I couldn’t bring myself to see her. I was still taking my pills but not as consistent as I used to. Also, I was graduating and due to my busy schedule I convinced myself that I was okay and that I was better. Applying for university and student loans were so stressful but I didn’t want to bother anyone so I figured it out on my own. Due to me not wanting to rely on anyone, I pushed my parents away and my mom even threatened to not come to my graduation because of my attitude about not needing g their help and that i’ll figure it out on my own. Once university started, I hardly went to the help sessions for first years. I always told myself that I could just look things up if I’m unsure. The first couple weeks of school was okay, I wanted it to be a fresh start, no one knew me. I could be who ever I wanted. I was driven. However that mindset didn’t last very long. Just like highschool I slacked off on my classes, preferred to stay home and sleep and not have to thing about anything. So I’m struggling in my classes and there’s a likely chance that I might fail a couple of them but I really need these subjects in order to get the major that I’ve always wanted since I was younger. There’s doctors and councillors on campus but I don’t know why I’m scared of going to them. I tried calling once but they said that i would have to book an appointment. And the thing with me is that when I’m really depressed I want help but then after a few days when I’m a bit better I think that my depression isn’t that serious and I don’t need help. So I didn’t book an appointment but instead went to a walk in clinic. The doctor was really nice and understanding and put me back on anti depressants. However it didn’t work, i was still struggling in school and that’s when I started hearing other students talking about adderall and “study drugs.” At this point, I’m so desperate because I don’t want to fail my classes, and I don’t want to withdraw because that’s a waste of money. And I don’t want to lose my student loans and scholarships. I’m considering going back to talk to my councillor and talking to her about possibly seeing a psychiatrist. Anyways that’s the end of that. If you have any advice, that would be greatly appreciated",07Nov2019,1

My sleep has been worse then usual. I do have a support system but sometimes I just feel so alone and like no one gets it, even though I know that's not true.

132,"I took three months 0,5g magic mushrooms and 100mg modafinil per day. Afterwards I took four months 100mg modafinil per day.

My psychotic symptoms started around the fourth month. I thought the professors at uni talked about me. Later on I saw shadows in my peripheral vision. At the end I went full blown psychosis with realistic hallucinations and strong delusions.

I had to be admitted to the psych ward and stop the modafinil. All my delusions subsided after they gave me haldol. It took me four days. After three weeks I had a delusion again for about 15 minutes. Now I’m six months symptom free and on 2mg risperidone.

They diagnosed me with Intoxication-Psychosis and also maybe paranoide schizophrenia. They were not sure. I read that it’s extremely rare to get a psychosis from modafinil. How can I find out, if it’s schizophrenia or not? They reduce my risperidone after three months of taking it, but it’s probably not the best choice, if I have schizophrenia. Why they gave me risperidone for three months and not one year?",07Nov2019,1
133,"I have a relative who is in college and staying on campus. She was recently kicked out of her dorm for being the blame for a roach infestation (food everywhere, dirty clothes and dishes), as well as being caught in camera smoking pot walking around the complex with a bong out in the open. 

If you ask her why she was kicked out she will say, ‘they just didn’t like me, they are mean people’.

So me and some other family moved her into a new complex with a different landlord. The girl(let’s call her Jane) dances around the house popping prescription meds every 15 minutes while me and the family worked tirelessly to get Janes stuff packed up and moved out. I asked Jane ‘that bottle says max two pills a day. How many have you taken?’ And her response is always ‘I’m managing it I know how many I’ve taken’ and then she runs off singing and dancing. 

This intro is probably off-putting so let’s give some more clear details.

She broke up with her boyfriend(who was a fantastic guy and had a great family), because him and his family ‘wanted her to change’. By change, they mean rush her hair(which she does not believe in), wear deodorant and shave her pits(which she does not believe in) and wear a bra (which she also, does not believe in. It’s tits everywhere around her and it’s not very nice).

After breaking up with her boyfriend she went in a sex craze and has random guys over all the time to sleep with that she doesn’t tell anyone else about. She says she has multiple boyfriends but is ‘more serious’ about one than the others.

I’m all over the place here, i know. It’s difficult to sum up what’s going on. 

Last night I got a call from a incredibly concerned relative who told me Jane was walking down alleyways and was lost, talking to people about how to get back to her dorm. She ended up asking a stranger from the hood to walk her home. She looked strung out on meth and had scrapes on her face. All she could say was how tired she was.

Shes recently started a instagram blog where she has started posting half naked pictures and gotten offers to be flown out of the country for ‘photo shoots’ which she’s considering going to. Jane is not the prettiest flower in the field. And she’s my the least bit skeptical about the shoots, and she really wants to go to them.

Her theraphist told her himself that the medication she’s taking is for bipolar, and that she’s not bipolar. And he believes the medication she’s being prescribed is causing her to lose touch with reality.

Where do you even begin with this? She has no parents. Only sisters and in-laws. Her sister has talked about becoming a power of attorney to help her take control of her insane over-medicating.

I don’t even know. Hate to see someone end up in sex trafficking but I’m at a loss.",07Nov2019,1
134,"I'm 21F and my bf is 24, we have been together for a little over a year and a half. 

I have a mix of little things and bad things boiling in my head many times a day and it's honestly driving me insane. 

The little things are stuff that my boyfriend used to do, like he used to be a sweet talker to his friends, even did this in front of me once. He used to pretend he had something with a handful of his friends just to mess around, all in jokes, but he confessed he doesn't think calling a friend ""love or bby"" while being in a relationship is wrong as long as it's only for affection. He never did this being with me but it bothers me so much, and he isn't a sweet talker anymore or has cooled down a ton. I've found messages where he talks to a past potential girlfriend and sends her hearts, but I never saw anything compromising or him trying something with someone else. He used to follow a ton of girls on Instagram, only girls and a lot of them half naked, he doesn't do it anymore but has yet to delete a good bunch of them. (He did delete the vulgar ones, just strangers left)

He used to joke a lot with his friends about a local slut we have here who is sort of famous, and he once while drunk said she was the goddess of town in front of me and his friends. He doesn't even follow her anymore.

It's a bunch of little hurtful things that keep getting at me, but he has changed a lot and doesn't do any of it so I don't see why I keep remembering these things. I keep being paranoid and checking his Instagram, fighting with the urge to grab his phone and see if he doesn't do any of these things anymore. I want to trust him but I can't.

The only really bad thing he did was with his first ex. She was his first relationship and the longest, they laster 2 years and something. They broke up only because she moved to france without telling him, and it's been like 5 years since they ended it. 
I found a conversation he had with her some time ago, the beginning of the year I think, and she asked him if he still had feelings for her. He said he was happy with me and that he only saw her as a friend, but she kept being pushy about the subject and even my bf's mom told me she was obsessed with him all this time, even though she's in a serious relationship with a guy there.

I let it go because I didn't see any harm but it pissed me off and I asked my bf why he didn't tell me about that conversation. He said she was the one that always looked to talk to him and that he only answers out of courtesy. I didn't think much of it, until I found a lot of half deleted messages and stuff my bf had hidden, he confessed he felt bad about deleting them but did it because he wasn't doing anything wrong and didn't want me to put up a scene about it.

About 4 months passed and for some reason it pissed me off so much, and knowing he didn't cut connection with her knowing how obsessed she was. I send her boyfriend a message saying she wouldn't stop going after my boyfriend and that I'm sorry he has to know that, but I was really pissed and if she has the balls to get in my relationship then why can't I do the same?

I ended up calling her bc she didn't respond my messages and long story short, she said a bunch of stuff that left me feeling stupid. She said my boyfriend is the one that always looked for her to talk and insisted on talking to her, she sent me the screenshots and everything. She also said a bunch of stuff that she supposedly made up according to my bf. I was beyond outraged because he lied to me all this time and I just couldn't understand why he couldn't detach himself from her and kept looking for her. He told me over and over that he only saw her as a friend and reacher her because she's the only ex with which he doesn't feel things are okay with, and he just wanted to be on good terms. 

It was a huge fight and he never really apologized well for it, but he deleted all of her pictures, memories, he deleted her from social media and said he wasn't going to talk to her again, that she's not so special and he would rather not fight with me. 

Don't get me wrong, my boyfriend is really sweet and caring, and I never thought of breaking up with him because he never did anything big or never tried anything with anyone. I just can't get this ex out of my head and it's making me angry all the time. I'm so paranoid of him doing any of these things again and overly sensitive to anything he says that triggers a memory of her.",07Nov2019,1
135,"I read one of my journals from when I was 19 or 20. I can't describe the emotions that flared up as I decided the words in my shaky black ink. I realized I battled bad depression and debilitating anxiety that altered my life greatly, completely alone and completely unaided. I never asked for help, I never seeked out medical, profesional attention. I realized I blocked most of my bad experiences, mostly related to being in a toxic relationship. 
Today I am 23, I am mentally and emotionally stable and still learning about myself. It's been a long painful journey. I feel as if everything got worse before It got better. It felt like my body was torn to pieces, I constantly found myself laying on the floor for hours, as if I were dead, completely absent minded and completely numb and detached from any consciousness of my immediate reality, all after failing to stop the pain and rotting desperation in me. 
I don't remember what happened after, to be honest I don't remember how I began to heal, I don't even remember the first time I felt okay.
What pushed me over the edge was my toxic partner leaving me suddenly, it completely destroyed me. 
That's all I remember. 
And now I'm here, feeling okay, I can be 'alone', un-partnered if you will, for as long as I want, I love my solitude,and maybe I don't love myself yet but I do take care of myself, and I know that even if I dont feel I deserve it, my body deserves it. I don't remember what or who might have saved me from drowning so deeply into my mental abyss. But I am grateful today that I am better.
I understand that the reason I did not seek help was because of my own negligence , yet I don't blame myself, I grew up in a household that although acknowledged mental illness, never accepted or confronted it and never spoke about it. I understand that I should have seeked  help, if not from my family, (who did not understand me) from literally anybody else. Instead of being pushed to the edge by my mental illness, I would have rather had someone there to push me, to really push me to get help. What if I decided to end my pain by other means? I do not know what my brain is capable of, what my illness was capable of back then. But to this day I still ask myself, if I had seeked out help before it all fell apart for me, and healed and got better. Would there still be part of me, that wanted/needed to see what it felt like to have it all to fall apart? Would I have to fall in a profound abyss in order to get better? These are the thoughts I fight now: seeing one of my best friends struggling the way I did, and thinking ""you need to get worse before you get better"".
Maybe it's the fact I read that damn journal of mine last night, maybe it's the dark and rainy weather that reminds me of the comfortable loneliness I've been through.
Is this wrong? Should I stop? Should I stop the thoughts?",07Nov2019,1
136,"Hello everyone.
I am going on a date with a girl I know for some time now. I know she had trouble with anorexia in a past due to an abusive boyfriend that encouraged her to be skinny. It was so bad she almost died and didn't have her period in months, and she only recovered due to her family pressuring her with forced hospitalization. When she recovered she had a psychical evalution and the shrink basically said ""Well you were anorexic and you healed yourself congrats."" according to her. Due to the fact that she didn't have her period she saidshe had to regain a whole bunch of weight (I can't really confirm it as she has never sent me a full body pic, but her face looks normal, not overweight at all as far I can judge it.).

Now the thing is she mentioned she sometimes goes on fasts for a whole week because it makes her feel more focused and empowered and it increases her emotional insight. I am really concerned though that it's anorexia speaking out of her, though I have no idea how healthy or unhealthy a week long water fast really is. I really, really like this person. We have a complicated history but we are moving in a good direction currently. Her eating disorder was basically caused by her abusive boyfriend - I am afraid that if I confront her on her eating habits she feels like I am the next man in her life trying to control her eating habits. How can I go about addressing my concern? Is it necessary at all?

137,"Okay, so last night before bed I had this strange  episode while staying at my boyfriend’s house  that only happens every so often when I get extremely stressed or sometimes for no reason at all, but it’s been happening to me since I was a child (about 7 or 8).

And in the police-conducted wiretap, the guy’s apologies to me were considered “inconclusive.” Never even questioned or detained the guy.

I’ve been struggling with mental illness for.... god almost a decade now. But this past year, shit just snowballed and it became..... well this is what a combination of sexual assault, mental illness, and sheer bad luck looks like haha. I stopped seeing my therapist not long after the rape bc she was no help.

Yesterday I found out that the driver in a very minor car accident (dented bumpers) is filing a lawsuit against me with lawyers notorious for going to court, claiming injuries that are just impossible.

The irony that the first time I see the inside of a courtroom may be as a defendant of a frivolous lawsuit rather than a rape victim broke my mind.

That’s when I knew I needed to find a therapist NOW. No more procrastinating. No more dread that leads to inaction. If I’m getting minimal help from friends, none in person (my best friends are all long distance and have babies), and questionable support from my family, I need to take charge of my own life.

154,"Here is an excerpt from my [blog](https://michelletaylortherapy.com/what-is-online-therapy) post I wrote about the efficacy of online mental health therapy. Let me know your thoughts about it and if you have experience with online mental health counseling.

Many people ask me, “What is online therapy? It can’t be as good as office therapy”. As a therapist, I, too, had these questions for my own therapy. I wanted to know what it felt like to try it. It was something I had to believe myself before I offered it. So, I set out on a quest to check out all sorts of teletherapy. Here’s what I found out.

## The Different Types of Online Therapy

The cool thing I’ve learned is that there are so many different types of online therapies available. Different platforms, different therapeutic techniques, different means of communicating. I believe mental health should not just be so black and white, in an office/hospital/care center or nothing. Mental health can be achieved in many places, on a phone, text, video, walking and talking, and emailing.

Types of online mental health therapy:

* phone
* video
* texting
* emailing

“[Telehealth](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/telehealth/art-20044878)” is an umbrella term that is used for insurance purposes. Doctors are starting to use it more and more, and as we become more technologically dependent, I believe it will be used in even more ways than we can imagine in the next few years. I remember the first time my general practitioner offered my medical records to be sent through an online portal. I could also ask questions directly to my doctor, skipping out on the hour Los Angeles commute to see him. And, anyone who’s lived in LA knows how priceless this is!

## Talkspace and Betterhelp vs. Private Practice Online Therapists

### Talkspace and Betterhelp

Mental health practitioners are starting to embrace the idea of online tools to offer their clients. When I first started my research into online therapy, I heard of [Talkspace ](http://www.talkspace.com/)and [BetterHelp](http://www.betterhelp.com/), two giant online therapy platforms that offer mental health therapy for a low cost. It’s a cool concept, if you’re new to mental health therapy and are on a budget.

I tried Talkspace as a client. I had my first male therapist, and I paid $30 a week to get unlimited texting to my therapist. I could text him as much as I wanted throughout the day, and he would generally respond one giant text at the end of the day. This was helpful for a few weeks, but what I noticed was that simply writing out my feelings in a text would be enough for me to work through my own problems. I realized it was a way to journal. And by the time my therapist would text me back, I would already be on to the next problem. I began to be my own therapist. It wasn’t for me. But, I’m not saying it wouldn’t be helpful to others.

I could have also spent more money and had video therapy with my TalkSpace therapist, but, at the time, I didn’t have the money. I was a poor graduate student. The texting option was convenient and just in my budget.

### Online Therapists in Private Practice

I then decided to get an online therapist that had a private practice. Since I’m in California, I had to find a therapist licensed in California. **Therapists may not do online therapy for clients that live outside of the state they are licensed in (for example, I live in California, so I have to have a California licensed therapist).** In California, telehealth is covered by most insurance companies. So, I was fortunate to be able to pay for my online mental health therapy with my insurance.

Working with a private practice therapist was my jam! She was attentive to my individual needs, and I had 50 minutes with her each week through a HIPAA compliant video platform. We used Zoom. I was able to meet her from my house, sometimes in my car (not driving, I pulled to the side of the road), and I loved not having to leave work to drive in LA traffic for a 50 minute appointment.

I didn’t experience any difference in my therapy from office therapy to online therapy. At first, it was awkward to get used to a new therapist, but this is normal in office, too. I was more comfortable in my own room, sometimes with my dogs and my favorite blankets. It really helped to get to the root of my problems quicker. Something I wouldn’t have gotten to as quickly in an office. But, that’s just me.

## Pros of online therapy:

* **convenience**: be with your favorite pillows, on the go, with your pets, in your favorite place
* **flexibility**: I could do text, email, and video from my phone/computer anywhere in the state
* **effectiveness**: online therapy has been found to be just as effective as office therapy
* **better hours**: most online therapists have early morning, night, and weekend availability
* **couples therapy**: my partner and I could also log on from different locations and still do therapy
* **affordable**: although it’s usually the same price in private practices, there are many online options that are affordable
* **file/screen sharing**: I could share a video, article, meme with my therapist on my screen, then process it!
* **sickness**: I could be sick and still have therapy without worrying about getting others sick or getting out of bed!
* **chronic pain**: people with chronic illness or pain can still get therapy from their homes
* **agoraphobia/anxiety**: people who feels anxious about leaving their homes or social anxiety can still receive therapy!
* **depression**: when you are at your worst and you don’t want to get out of bed, you don’t have to!
* **quick check ins**: I offer quick 30 minute session to my clients. This is a great option for those weeks that are specifically more difficult than others. I wouldn’t want to drive in LA traffic for a 30 minute office appointment.
* **Parents can get therapy**: often, parents have to find care for their kids to get therapy. This is expensive and takes extra time. Online therapy allows parents to get quick time away while still in their home.

## Cons of online therapy:

* **Wifi**: it needs to be a good connection. Sometimes some audio/video glitches happen, but the therapist usually has a backup plan, like doing a phone session.
* **Hugs**: I am a hugger. Some people aren’t. I miss the ability to give my therapist a hug. And as a therapist, some of my clients mention this to me that they wish they could hug me. We do “air hugs” online, if needed.
* **Distractions**: being at home or in a car can often run the risk of distractions interrupting therapy. I remind my clients to make sure they are free of distractions and set up their space as a safe space with confidentiality.
* **People are skeptical of it**: Trust me. I get haters all the time saying, “online therapy is not as good as office therapy”. This is simply B.S. and the nay-sayers are just people who haven’t tried it. I have tried it. I have been a client and I am also an online therapist. Online therapy is just as effective, if not more at times, as office therapy. Here is also some research that proves [this](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15228830802094429).

## Reasons I wouldn’t do online therapy with a client

* **Suicidality**: This is outside the scope of online therapy. I believe, as other online therapists do too, that if you are feeling like you want to kill yourself, you should call 911 or go to your nearest hospital. Online therapy is not indicated for clients that are suicidal.
* **Some disorders require in person therapy for efficacy**. These may be intellectual disorders, psychotic episodes, etc. But, when you call a therapist, they should assess whether or not online therapy is a good fit for your issues.
* **Children**: I know of some therapists that can work with children online, but in general, I find children need play therapy and no distractions. I don’t know of may children that can sit in front of a screen without distraction. So, make sure you get in person therapy for children. Some teenagers can do online therapy, but, the therapist would need to assess.

158,"My friend (J) is in a relationship with this girl (C) that i have since become friends with, but im extremely worried about him at this point. I have observed and heard about many instances between them that considered be considered emotional and physical abuse. A few of them were: 

1. C hitting, slapping, or punching J quite frequently and then many times saying she was ""just playing/joking"" or blaming it on a mental disability she has (autism).

2. C not taking into account J's feelings, wants, and needs, instead making it all about her. Like a few days ago J told C he wanted to legally adopt a family friend who was orphaned rather recently (family friend is 13, J is 25) and C absolutely threw a fit and started hurting herself, absolutely refusing to let him go through with it because she was worried she wouldn't be the center of attention anymore (even though she admitted she wants kids soon so it makes no sense)(also keep in mind, this is just a basic relationship at this point, C and J arent married or even engaged at this point).

3. C is always overly clingy and is extremely jealous when theres nothing to be jealous about. Such as J no longer being allowed to have girls numbers in his phone (even his mothers) and barely being allowed to have any female friends on Facebook otherwise C goes ballistic. 

4. Finally the biggest one is that C guilt trips J and blackmails him. If J even says he just wants to take a break from the relationship (not even break up for good, just take like a week or 2 break) C will threaten to kill herself or even actually attempt to do so.

I keep trying to make J see that this is not a healthy relationship at all but he keeps saying ""ive never felt this way about someone before"" (he has trouble feeling most emotions so him actually feeling someting is a big deal) and hes convinced that because he actually feels something, that C MUST be the one and hes afraid to let that go. But C's behavior keeps escalating and im afraid hes going to get seriously hurt whether physically or emotionally and i want to help but dont know how. Anyone know how i can help him?",07Nov2019,1

I personally have, in the past, had my own struggles with mental health. I dropped out of high school for 2 years due to major depressive disorder, multiple serious suicide attempts and lots of self destructive behaviour. I have recieved lots professional help and am out of the thick of it. Through my experience, I feel like have a pretty good grasp on how to support others with depression. 

Though body image issues are a new frontier for me. I know basic information, such as not focusing on compliments or her appearance. She has exhibited some self harming behaviours (pinching herself) and will refuse to eat some days due to her belief that she is overweight.

The biggest change in my mental health journey was the realization that I needed to change my perception and needed to seek out help. She hasn't gotten to that stage yet, and is hostile towards seeking out help at present.

I love her a lot, we have a supportive and healthy relationship. I am looking for a healthy approach for how to support her. Thank you in advance and I can provide more information if need be!

I don't know how many times it happened (more than once) but when i was small, i was crying a lot and making scenes. This happened at our house.
When this happened, my parents locked me in the darkness in the hall. I was hysterical, I started crying even more, begged them to let me in, because i was scared to be alone and in the dark. They told me to calm down and that they won't let me in if i don't calm myself. I started banging my head against the wall and they still wouldn't let me in.

Last week I only left home once, since my mom says taking the dogs around the block doesn't count. I literally have no desire or motivation to do anything. I use to enjoy painting and drawing, I don't have any interest in doing it anymore. My mom will go out shopping, and I'd rather just stay home in bed.

164,"Hi lovely people of r/mentalhealth

This might not fit on this subreddit, but I didn't know where else to post it so if it's not the right place: sorry for that... Also not a native speaker so forgive my errors. 

Anyway, on to the story. I'm currently in a relationship for almost a year with an awesome guy. I know that it isn't that long relatively, but we've known each other for longer and it certainly feels like it has been a few years. There always has been a strain though. He always dealt with mental illness and a voice that tells him to do stuff or that he's worthless etc. The past few months that voice started to command him to hurt me (hit and punch me) and more recently to strangle/suffocate me. So far he hasn't given in to that voice yet, but the urge becomes stronger and harder to resist. A result of this is that I don't feel safe around him, especially during his episodes (or however you say it in English). If it happens I constantly have to watch his hands and legs so that I can react and protect myself when needed.

So the diagnose came recently that he suffers from a non specified psychosis. It made a lot of sense and explained a lot of things. The thing is I don't know how to deal with it. It's not the diagnosis, but everything else that's happened (symptoms etc) that weighs quite heavily on me and I don't know what to do. I considered breaking it off, but I'm afraid of the damage that'll do to him and what he might do to himself. He did say more then once that he couldn't and would never live without me, no matter the cost... Not the most reassuring message... Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

166,"If I know someone (mainly people I am close with) is keeping something hidden from me (literally anything, it can be the smallest thing like I ask where they were when I tried calling, or what they're doing, or it can be bigger but usually it is the tiny things which is why it makes me feel like it is unusual), I will immediately start crying, isolate myself, mainly I feel anxious and unsettled and it will take up the next hour at least of me feeling like this.

It’s a bad memory, and I don’t like to think about it, but today I think something actually triggered a more intense response. I saw a post giving advice on what to do if your dog starts choking, and it reminded me of the feeling in my throat and how scared I was, and I actually started crying.

176,"This is surely going to be a long post. I have a lot of things I want to get out of my chest, but I will still try to keep this as short as possible.  
I want to clarify, first of all, that I am not looking for a diagnosis and I will not trust myself to get self-diagnosed. I just want advice, or at least telling this to someone who isn't imaginary.  
Anyway, let's get straight to the point: I think I either have a mental disorder, or I want to have one, in which case it would still be a problem.  
The reasons why I believe this are too many to put in this post, so I'll just mention the ones I consider more relevant, and if anyone has a question you are free to comment.  
To begin with, I'm extremely shy. I've always been like that, but it has increased so much during my adolescence that I don't even feel confident with my few friends anymore. I don't get together with them often (around once a month), and when I do I realize how much I'm distancing from them and how little I know about what's going on, and I end up feeling like crap and not wanting to see them again to avoid this. This and many other little things have made me think that I could be on the **autism spectrum**. I've researched a lot about this and I always end up with a ""maybe"". I have some of the symptoms, but either I don't feel that they are very noticeable, or they aren't so ""characteristic"". Also, I do not have problems regarding learning (in fact I have it pretty easy with almost all subjects), I am not very sensitive when it comes to sound and touch, and, as far as I know, I'm a rather imaginative person.  
Another thing that's been bothering me a lot this year is the fact that I have imaginary friends. I believe this would be **maladaptive daydreaming**, but it's not just that. I act out the scenes I imagine, I speak out loud and gesture (even in public), and I am very emotionally attached to my imaginary friends. I have a whole secondary life that I mix with my ""actual"" life to make it less boring. I can't stop talking to them. Not myself, *them,* even in my mind. I explain things that I clearly don't need to explain to myself over and over again for no reason. I did some research about imaginary friends as well, but nothing I found seemed to fit my case completely. But yeah, maladaptive daydreaming would be the most accurate in my opinion, even though I don't believe this whole thing is interfering with my life, it's just that it has become quite a big thing this last year.  
Now, this is not the first time I've found myself fitting (or rather almost forcing myself to fit) the description and symptoms of a mental disorder. It's happened in the past with schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorders, and very recently, dissociative identity disorder. This time it lasted quite longer, and I do have quite a better understanding of the disorders I'm thinking about. But I noticed that this strange attraction towards hospitals, an unusual liking for disabilities and an almost desire to have a mental illness have been present in my life ever since I was a child. This is what makes me afraid that I might be subconsciously faking, imagining or exaggerating all of this. I want to emphasize the case of DID specifically, because when I started getting deeper into the topic and found out there was no way I could have that, I found myself straight up **disappointed** for not having it. And that's when the idea of a possible factitious disorder came into mind.  
However, this doesn't seem to fit completely either, and that's driving me crazy. I never faked symptoms, especially not in front of people, so why would I be faking to myself? The idea of having a mental illness or being in a wheelchair is so strangely, unreasonably appealing to me and I hate that. It's definitely not a fetish, that's for sure. It's like I identify with it. It doesn't happen with anything else.  
I feel really shitty for wanting to have a mental disorder or a disability because I feel that I'm not taking the people who suffer from this seriously enough. I apologize if I am being offensive or disrespectful to anyone here in any way, I really do. But I needed to get this out of me. Again, I'm not looking for an online diagnosis. I've been thinking about asking my parents to take me to a psychiatrist, but I'm so uncertain about everything that I just don't know. What am I supposed to tell them? Should I ask them now anyway or wait and hope for this weirdness to go away? Is it just an illusion, a subconscious need for attention that I should just ignore?  
Again, I'm really sorry for the long post and for being disrespectful. I really don't know what is happening and I just want to do something to get a definite answer for once.",07Nov2019,1

180,"I've been on a two day refresher first aid training course because I'm a designated first aider at a high school. Everything was going great, today was the final day with the assessment (I passed yay). About an hour before the assessor arrived, we were practicing bandaging different types of various wounds eg. a burst varicose vein on the leg, an embedded object in the arm, a horizontal cut across the palm. 

The instructor came over to me and my partner who also works at the school I do and said we would have to remember to roll up the sleeve or trouser leg in the actual assessment and I felt myself freeze up. My legs and arms are covered in pretty gross big scars. They're not coverable with makeup even if I had any with me and they're not passable as cat scratches. I look a bit like a zebra. Because I work in a school I have not openly discussed my mental health issues or my self harm, apart from to an external company that deals with keeping a record of all staff medical issues. I don't want them thinking I'm unfit to work with children.

So the only thing that came to my mind was to say my legs were really hairy because it's winter. Like REALLY hairy.

Then about ten minutes later I said just to my partner that if I did have to roll my sleeves up, it's a mess, so be ready for that. It makes me feel sick even typing this. I was so panicky and embarrassed. At my first training they allowed us to bandage over the clothing so this was a huge surprise to me.

I feel like I need to vomit all the time and have thrown up in my mouth a few times. My anxiety is also really just not great. Its general, I just feel like something “is wrong” but it doesnt go away and it adds to the discomfort. 

Everything feels vaguely spinny and I feel really run down, like I have the flu. I cant keep any food down and Ill take a few bites of something and then throw it away. I also feel super spacy and my body twitches (but it always does that, I twitch because of anxiety and IDK, but that isnt new, just worse)

There are other things but I dont want to whine too much.

I just want say I hate this. I will always hate this. And I am so done with everything.

I feel so alone, I dont have emotional support from my family and I dont tell people in my real life about my condition so no support from friends either. I feel like I am balancing all this stupid crap on my shoulders and I just dont want to do it anymore",07Nov2019,1
184,i won’t get into the back story but someone online said “your a waste of\*\*\*\*\*” after we lost the matchcould tell he was in a bad mood once the match started I told myself he’s probably just a young kid and that his logic doesn’t make any sense but still it gets to me but I don’t know why,07Nov2019,1
185,"Hi all,

Things are getting progressively worse, please refer to an earlier post of mine for a bit of backstory.

Around 2 months now maybe I don't know. In fact recently my heads been filled with cement; I can't think, I struggle to form a sentence while talking, sometimes I'll hit a wall and stop dead in my tracks as I forgot what I was talking about. I forget so much. I can turn on a tap and forget to turn it off after washing my hands, forgetting to flush the toilet after use, I'll even take out my meds then sign for them and leave them without taking them. I feel so confused all the time.

The other day I thought I was being followed. I thought I was going to be the victim of a robbing and stabbing. Less than 5 mins before that I thought I had a premonition of the event. When he was behind me; I turned and got ready to hit the guy. I thought ""this is it."" I thought it was how I was going to die. I don't think my heart has stopped like that for so long. He avoided me in this sort of semi-circle radius and kept walking. Leaving me standing alone - trying to refain composure. I don't know if I'm in a film. Have I been picked for something unbeknownst to me? I often see people with their phones; and I wonder if they're filming me. Recently I've thought of taking my life but I also really don't want for that. It doesn't help to ease my anxiety when I hear what sounds like footsteps or often shoes on gravel behind me. I've started to keep an eye out when I go out now but I retrospectively imagine I must look so blatant and stupid, it's embarrassing, but I can't help but feel like this. I sometimes see people in my peripheral view pretty clearly and that will make me whip round to them to find that nobody's there. Same with the noises of boots on the ground. Also I can taste what I imagine my mouth would be like if I smoked a pack a day for 20 years with a cigar each evening (I don't and have never smoked and I have pretty good oral health as I even cut down on sugar to help my teeth.) Like all the time it's driving me nuts; it began about 2 months ago too.

I'm sure there is more I can add but I can't think clear right now. Like I feel like I may have already died; I know this may be strange but: I didn't actually die that night did I?

My head feels absolute fried at times.",07Nov2019,1
186,"I recently learned that I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style and I’ve come to the realization that it’s the reason why I can’t really maintain a real relationship.  I dealt with enmeshment &amp; emotional parentification from my mother, and inconsistency &amp; abandonment from my father throughout my childhood, and I know that trauma is what caused me to develop this attachment style. 

I’ve never had a relationship that’s lasted more than 6 months because I get anxious and think I’m not worthy of love, that they don’t actually like me etc, or I feel like I need to leave before the other person abandons me. I haven’t been in a “real” relationship since 2017.  Since then, I’ve just settled for being a plaything for men that only want sex.  I’ve fallen for every FWB I’ve had because my mind equates sex with love at this point, and it’s only made me avoid relationships even more. 

However, I desperately want to be in a relationship. I want to be able to make it past that 6 month mark for the first time and have a stable, healthy relationship w/ someone who loves me, but I’m terrified of rejection &amp; abandonment.  I don’t know what to do or how to overcome this. 

TLDR; developed fearful-avoidant attachment style due to childhood trauma, can’t maintain relationships, &amp; just want to overcome my attachment style so I can have a healthy relationship for once.",07Nov2019,1

188,"I'm a 45 year old guy, and my childhood was horrific. And really weird. I am remarkably sane considering the dark places I've been. There's some recent trauma too that I'm really struggling to process.

I have a fear of sharing what I've been through, because much of it is really upsetting. And I also (irrationally, I know) feel like I should be over it by now. Even though I'm the first to encourage other people to be open and vulnerable, and am in many ways myself, there's a lot I don't let on. 

And I feel trapped because I don't know how to begin to not be secretive about that shit.

I have a huge fear of making people feel uncomfortable, but I really need to reach out to my friends for support and I am really scared of doing that. I'm currently very popular and very lonely! Everyone tells me I'm very kind, but I don't know how to ask for kindness for myself.

I've been to counsellors a lot over the years, but that's not what I feel like I need at the moment. I need to feel loved and supported by people who choose to care because I matter to them.

I have some amazing friends who I know would see me through if I could just step past that barrier in my head.",07Nov2019,1
189,"Hello Reddit,

I’m in a really bad spot. I never reach out so this is difficult for me. From the outside I’m a well functioning person so it makes it hard to gain any kind of sympathy for my state of mind. It’s been hard to fall asleep the last couple of days.
I just can’t stand being alone with myself. I don’t even know where to begin. Could anyone guide me through this. Thanks.",07Nov2019,1
190,"Ever since she was little, she’s had this weird sort of obsession with being restrained or trapped. Like, this goes all the way back to when she was 2 years old- it’s always been like this. I thought that maybe it was just a weird kid thing because kids sometimes have weird fascinations, but it’s persisted for her entire life- almost 19 years. 

She’s not vocal about it at all, but being my best friend, she told me that whenever she reads stories or watches movies where people or characters are trapped, caged, tied up, or restrained/held captive in any sort of way she gets excited I guess and sometimes jealous of them- like she wants to be in that same situation. This includes victims of kidnapping, torture, sexual harassment, rape, and other things in that area. The best way she said that describes it is it’s almost like a turn-on.

I think it really bothers her because she doesn’t know or understand why she feels like this. I don’t think she has ever or will ever tell another soul about it because she’s so embarrassed and ashamed about it. She is by no means a bad person at all and even talking about the subject horrifies her because she hates that it happens and she can’t help it.

She has no other mental health issues besides from mild anxiety and depression passed from our parents, but both are treated.

She gave me permission to ask here in the hopes that someone would have some insight because she just wants to be normal. Any suggestions would be great. If you or someone you know has had experiences with something related, please share",07Nov2019,1
