0,"I’ve been diagnosed w depression and anxiety, OCD, and a few doctors have talked to me about bipolar. I have a hard time verifying that that’s actually what’s wrong.  Like some mental illness can’t be diagnosed surely until you just find meds that work which is a stressful, side effect ridden game.

Also I’m just generally being not decisive about medicating. I know it has a potential to help because meds have before. Then they either stop working, become super expensive, or my doctor switches because I feel better or worse or have too many thoughts about what could be wrong.

I overthink, I know.
I just need to come to terms w treatment, which is really difficult when you’ve been seeking help for years and it keeps eventually failing. I’m tired of feeling like the happiness is temporary.",15Aug2019,2

4,"Hi there. I have been raised in a Catholic household, but not too religiously devout. I have been having mental struggles either myself over what choices I should make about my sexuality. I sometimes watch porn and I feel guilty whenever I watch it. I then flat out stopped watching it for a good few years and it took a huge toll on my mental health and made me very sexually frustrated. It got so bad that I asked my mother for advice on the situation. Me and my mother are close and she took it really well. Also a catholic, she told me that there was nothing wrong with watching it in healthy doses. However every other Christian person I see online insist that it is bad under all circumstances. I’m not sure what to do or who to see about this. Before it comment, I don’t want to see any posts telling me to leave the religion or anything. Nothing can make me change my belief in God or anything like that. I believe in forgiveness and eternal love, but I just can’t shake the guilt. What should I do? Thank you for listening.",15Aug2019,1
5,"I’m 15 and can’t live with either of my parents. I just can’t. I’m not physically abused but my mother has almost driven me to suicide many times. I tried living with my dad but I saw my mom just as much and it didn’t help. I was planning on killing myself tonight but I have a feeling if I don’t live with either of my parents I would be a happy person. But there’s a problem with this. I don’t have anywhere else to live. I feel like I could go from anxiety, MAJOR suicidal thoughts, maybe depression, (that’s not clarified I think I’m just sad, not depressed) to being one of the happiest kids ever if I had a nice place to live with accepting people. When I tell my mom this she says “no one is going to let you live with them and do nothing but smoke weed and play video games” (which is basically what I did living with my mom) but what she doesn’t understand is that SHES the reason I do those things. I could live without both of them just fine but not with her. I just really need a place to stay but I have no clue where to go. I live in Austin Texas if that’s any help to giving you a suggestion on where I could stay, but someone please help me out. I’d honestly be willing to move anywhere, whether it be another state or country just to not have to see my mom.",15Aug2019,1

When I was 16, I had this older guy take advantage of me at a party with his friends. They were both 18. Afterward, they ignored me and bragged to their friends, calling me gross. His younger brother was in my grade, and his friends bullied me too before that happened. I had no social media, and they would make posts about how I looked old and that I'm a fat slut.



They would pick apart my features every day. My lips are too thin, eyes too close together, man jaw, prominent chin, and that I was the ugliest girl in school. I moved away at 18 to a new state; it's been four years since all this happened.



The guys in my grade would ask me for sex but tell me not to tell anyone because I was so ugly. They would say no man will ever want me. They said I'm attractive enough to sleep with but not to be seen with me.
.


They would say I'm the grossest girl in school, and any guy who sleeps with me is desperate. They would greet me by telling me I have wrinkles all over my face that I had peeling skin. I was so disgusting I burned and deleted all the photos from school.


Is it true when people bully you it shows their shitty character, not yours? Why else would I be treated this way unless I was hideous and annoying? Was this my fault? Doesn't the bullying show I'm weird?",15Aug2019,3

8,"my life is awful im so sick of being miserable.  theres no quality of life im so anxious every day to the point i cant function.  im shaking all day ive had 3 panic attacks at work this week, every little comment makes me feel like fucking garbage.  i put myself through torture every day to go home and be miserable alone, im always fucking alone.  The one time I try to put myself out there I get cheated on twice, sexually assaulted and hooked on cocaine.  I can't do anything right no matter how hard i try.  i feel like fucking shit all the time and it doesnt stop.  Its been a quarter of my life dealing with this shit, i just want to be a kid again, i just wanna exist and not be a burden to everyone.  my dad told me today im too stressful to help and hes done and doesnt care if im homeless, after telling me to move out a week ago.  the only people in my life that havent abandoned me want me gone.  Nothing gives me pleasure or excitement, its just pain.  I have no one and nothing to live for so why the fuck do i put myself through hell every day.  This is my third job this year and im already sick of it, I just cant be around people it doesnt work.  My dad tells me every morning that im trying to fail and I keep doing this to myself, and he's probably right.  Every fucking decision I made led to this shit, I could have been a normal kid and had a normal life.  Now even if by some miracle all my problems go away I'm still gonna look like a nutjob covered in scars, I'm still gonna be a dropout and I've already wasted what was supposed to be the best years of my life. I'm never going to have a normal life.  

I'd do anything to be happy.  I'd give up everything I have just for a week of happiness.  This was supposed to be my second chance and it went to shit so fucking fast.  I just want to die i wish i died years ago.  i just wanna sleep and never wake up again.  I dont fucking care who it effects, people shouldnt treat others like trash and expect someone to just take it over and over again.  I just wanna be honest about how I feel for once in my life.  I have a therapy session tommorow, one of the few I have left until I lose coverage in a month.  Im gonna fucking flip shit if she tells anyone.  If I get dragged to a hospital I'm doing heroin till i OD, I'm not living with the shame of going through that again.  I'm not going back to work or facing my family after that.  Its fucking retarded you cant be honest about this shit without fear of being hospitalized.  I just want help I dont want my life ruined again",15Aug2019,1
9,"Before i start anything,i just want to say,obviously i'm not in a very bad situation,it could get a 1000 times worse,but i'm very sensitive,and a lot of things happened recently that really brought me down,so i just want to spill my guts out,because i don't really have anyone to tell these things.

So i just turned 18 about 3 weeks ago,just finished high school,will be going to university from September,which sounds pretty exciting,but recently I've been very emotionally unstable,because during my life,a lot of bad events happened.

I grew up in a house with my mom,my aunt and my grandparents. I'm not saying any of them are bad people,but most of the times,they were always arguing on something,i moved away with my mom when i was about 8 years old,and my grandparents still argue to this day,whenever we visit them,so growing up with them,really made me very quick-tempered and sensitive to a lot of things. 

My father died in a motorcycle accident a month after my 10th birthday,and ever since,a lot of the times I've been very sad and pessimistic about anything in life,because obviously it was a hard hit for me that i lost my father.

My mother met a man through online dating when i was about 9,because my father and my mother got divorced when i was around 7,and ever since that,that man has been my step-father. He is cool and everything,overall a great person,but over the years,he's become more and more alcoholic,so their relationship with my mother has been off and on for a long time,which caused a lot more tension and arguing.

I don't want to go into too much details in this,because it will already be a very long post,but basically I got to know this beautiful girl through my friends,who is also 18 years old,because we were always in the same friend group,but never talked,so we started talking back in December,and in February we got together.I never really had any female attention in my life,never had a girlfriend before her,never even had a kiss,so she was my first big love. As i said,I've always been kinda sad and pessimistic,but she changed this all. Whenever we met,my mood got a 100 times better,she basically changed me as a person,and helped me see the good things in life. Before her I was really insecure,didn't really have any self confidence,but she changed this also. She made my life a 1000 times better. As i mentioned,i just finished high school,and I live in Hungary,and here when you finish high school you have to do a set of final exams of different subjects,and then you can apply to University,and they will decide if they are going to accept you or not by your score that you earned on your high school finals,so it's a pretty big deal. I've always been very nervous when it came to exams,but this was the biggest exam that has yet came around in my life.She just finished high school as well,but the University she applied to required a lot higher score than the one I applied to,so she was a lot more nervous than i was. And during this period,we never really went on a date,never really met,because she was always studying,so our relationship kind of broke a little bit. Besides that period,everything was going great,but at the end of June,a week after we were done with our finals,we were together for 4.5 months,and from one day to another,she confessed to me at a party,that she is not in love with me,never was,she thought it would develop,but it didn't,so she wants to break up,and she broke up with me the next day through Facebook Messenger. I really really loved her,I did everything I could for her,she was my everything. I know,I'm young,and it was only 4.5 months,so it's not that big of a deal,but to me,it is. We agreed that we would stay friends,because she has no problems with me,I don't really have any problems with her,and since we are in the same friend group,that would be weird if we hated each other,so I was like ""okay,cool,let's stay friends"",but she's been acting very weird,one day she doesn't even care about me,then the other day she messages me and she asks me how I've been and stuff. I don't know what's really going on with her,but the fact that she would tell me she loves me every day for 4.5 months,and then it turns out none of that is true really breaks my heart,and the fact that i was really in love,and that it wasn't returned at all,it just sucks. Since she broke up with me,I've been very sad,because i ""lost"" the person i loved the most,who encouraged me to keep going,who made my life better,and i still really miss her,but starting to hate her a bit. Whenever we talk,i wish we didn't talk,and whenever we don't talk,i wish we did,so i feel very weird about her. I don't want to be in bad terms with her,because i still think she's an amazing person,but i'm not sure if it's good for me if we continue as friends. I really can't decide. Back to the school topic. So i got accepted to the University I applied to as my second option. It's cool and all,but i will be moving to another city,about 155 kilometers away,which to me is already pretty scary,and I applied to Dormitory,but I didn't get accepted,so until like November,right now I don't really have a place to live at,because my friend said I could live with him,but the flat they bought is still in the build process,so it will be done in October,and we can move in in November,but until that,i don't know what to do. My mom makes barely above minimum wage a month,so we can't afford to rent an apartment. So that really makes me a lot more nervous about everything.

Recently my grandfather,who is 83 years old,got sick,he had multiple surgeries because of hernia,bowel infection and everything. The surgeries were successful,but since that,he's been still very sick,he had to go back to the hospital,and i'm really worried about him.

A lot of my friends who seemed they care about me,recently they don't give a shit about me,never invite me to any events,if they do something we used to do together,they rather not tell me and do it alone. I basically had about 10 really close friends,but right now i have 2 that i still trust,which is more than enough,but still kind of a big change to what it was like before.

I know some of these things are not really big deals,and that i will face worse obstacles in life as i get older,but right now,since i'm young,and so far these are the biggest problems I've ever faced in life,i really had enough. I try to stay positive,but right now it feels like my life is falling apart. I've been very very unstable emotionally,and i don't know how long i can take it. I can't control my emotions,one minute I'm happy,then I'm sad,then I'm angry. I don't have the motivation to do anything.

Sorry if i made lots of grammar mistakes,English isn't my first language,and also sorry if this post is a bit of a mess,i probably left some things out,and as i said i left out some details about the relationship i wrote about,so if you have any questions about anything i wrote,just ask me.

Thanks a lot for reading this,and thanks in advance if you have any advice for me what to do.",15Aug2019,1
10,"Sorry I really just need to vent.

I really don’t know what to do anymore. I got help in January and slowly but surely I got better. I got so much better I couldn’t believe how happy I was. 

I got a boyfriend. I lost weight. I got friends. I was happy!!

And now I just got off the phone with my aunt who made me promise her I wouldn’t kill myself. She begged. 

And you know who I blame? My mom. 

I’m 22 years old. I drink occasionally. I don’t really smoke. I have a job. I went to school. Like I did everything my mom wanted me to do. 

Honestly this is so much to unpack. I’m staring to realize this has been happening my entire life.

She’s extremely controlling and she has the biggest victim complex I’ve ever seen.

If I’m not home when she wants, she snaps. When she’s mad at me she doesn’t talk to me until I apologize (even if I didn’t do anything wrong). She has never once apologized to me for the shit she’s done to me throughout my life.

I really don’t even do anything that should make her treat me this way. 

Something happened a week ago. She hasn’t talked to me since. She won’t even look at me. 

I tried talking to her but just stayed silent. 

Anyway, I’m trying to move out now.

But my mental health is gonna be fucked up for who knows how long now. I’m really fucked up. My meds aren’t working anymore. I don’t know what to do!

Getting health insurance isn’t really a possibility right now either. I don’t even know if I even want to do anything anymore. I don’t have the energy to even try.

12,"Hi r/mentalhealth

I'm not sure really where to start, but I am a man in my 20s who spent most of my early childhood being abused by my father and occasionally his friends. This consisted of both verbal insults and physical punishments, e was kicked out when I was 13, but at that point I was already pretty fucked. Because of this - socializing with men who are roughly the age of my father and his friends has always been painfully difficult for me.

  I would be uncomfortable when near someone, and if alone with them I occasionally began to panic and react unfairly. Around highschool I began to realize that this was becoming an issue, and ever since then have secretly catered my life to interact with mostly women, in my head it always seemed like the safer choice...

 One example for clarity: When I picked classes in HS &amp; uni, I would automatically disregard a class if it were taught by a man in that age group unless it was the absolute only choice. I know this is wrong, but I would often rationalize it in my head as ""not risking my academic performance"".

Now that im in the real world, and in a field that is mostly men - I'm beginning to think I've been kicking this can down the road. A co-worker [50m] I work most closely with is, objectively, a great guy. I won't go into details, but everyone in the world upon knowing him would enjoy a beer with him once he started talking. Somehow, I still tense up when he walks into my office. But today, after a big project was wrapped up, he invited me out for a beer at a nearby bar. Over the last few months, I thought I was getting comfortable with him, so of course I accepted.

The place we went to was the most country dive bar if there ever was one. A few dozen middle aged guys were all hanging around having a good time, and from the instant I walked in I began feeling anxious. My mind was absolutely filled with experiences from my childhood with my dad &amp; friends, and I was horridied. Apparently it was obvious enough to my coworker, and he asked if everything was okay. I just wanted to leave, and knew that I was about to embarrass myself if I didn't get out of this situation. I quickly drank my beer, paid out my tab - and left about 15 minutes after I first walked in. Saying goodbye to him was the last thing on my mind, he probably thinks I'm the worst guy to take to grab a beer with now.

I'm currently sitting in a parking lot trying to calm down, and I need this all written down. I obviously have some things I need to work on. 

Thanks for letting me vent.",15Aug2019,1

I was recently told by a psychiatrist that I was thinking about joining the Air Force, but he said I would probably not be allowed to because of my history. I've been on Zoloft for a while now.

On top of that, I have to complete 50 hours of outside physical activity and *that* is really stressing me out. Also, at my school, every senior has to complete this huge community service project that entails at least 25 service hours and a ten-minute formal presentation at the end of the year. 

I have never really had a workload quite like this and it's really intimidating. I can't quit any of the classes I'm taking because all three of them are things I'm really passionate about and I don't think I'd ever forgive myself if I opted out.

27,"Hi. I have a bad feeling. I have aspergers autism so this may help contribute to my story that I am about to tell here. I feel like I was born transgender, except instead of feeling like being a girl when you are a boy or vise versa, I feel like being an identical twin when I was born at one birth. 

So, I have been interested in researching multiple births, and I know almost everything there is about multiples (well not literally everything but you know what I mean). I was then thinking “what if I had a twin I could do everything with and look like?” What first started off as a simple daydream or dream at night about living life with my fantasy identical twin brother quickly became an obsession. I literally wanted him to be there. I sometimes would talk to myself as if I were talking to my unborn twin brother. I would imagine going to school and all my friends thinking we were cool and being jealous of us. 

At school, I don’t even feel happy. I started my first day of middle school today and I felt upset when I was walking to class and saw a set of identical twins walking together and I quickly became jealous and my mind kept fantasizing being an identical twin. 

I have an older sister who is about 9 years older than me. While she has graduated college, she is not truly moved out of my parents house. I don’t consider going to college moving out as you still need your parents care since you’re working to get a job. And my sister is going to medical school which takes 8 years and while she has a husband, he is going to college and is only in the army making very little amount of money. So I don’t consider her moved out for another 8 years. Besides, her medical school isn’t too far away from home so we see her at least once a month unless it’s summer or a holiday. And if it’s during the week I call her or FaceTime. 

Anyways, my older sister and I have a lot in common. We are both interested in internet research and she also has the same autism I do. I told her how I feel about wanting to be an identical twin, she says it’s not that fun because her friends are identical twins and complain about “having to be the same person.” I told her that her friends are retarded and I would kill just to have a twin. 

So even though identical twins can’t be a boy and girl (they can, but it’s extremely rare), my sister agreed to be my twin and said I could be a singleton medically, but a twin mentally. It’s just like how a transgender person would be their birth gender medically, but the opposite sex mentally. So now I always call her my identical twin sister. I try to look like her (we don’t look the most alike, but we have a resemblance like most families, and our facial features are similar). 

I haven’t told my parents how I feel because I am embarrassed as HELL and afraid they will say the same old “you’re silly” or “you can’t control it besides being a twin sucks because they have to share.” The only person I told besides my sister is my therapist, who I made her SWEAR not to tell my mom. I didn’t even tell her it was a mental obsession, I just said “I want to be an identical twin because it’s cool.” I also have a psychologist who I meet with once a week, so I plan on telling her how I feel next week when I meet with her. 

Is there an official term for someone born like this, or is it just me? Please don’t mock me for this by the way. And this is not a troll or spam post. Right now, I am in bed while my family is up. I am crying, wondering what my unborn identical twin brother would say if he were born. I want some genuine advice for what to do and who to talk to. Thanks.",15Aug2019,2
28,"Idk why but it seems every single day, whenever anything is going well...

My mind will just pick any random thing and decide it’s the end of the world. 

For example, I was speaking with a few coworkers about a work related topic. My boss called the desk to tell one coworker to tell me to basically leave the desk because he doesn’t like us to conversate our in the open. 

Here’s the thing, apparently he named me specifically and while my coworker told everyone to disperse, she specifically looked at me primarily. 

Idk. My day was at best good, and at work average but for some reason my mind just wants me to have a literal breakdown over this one event. 

Like I keep ranting in my head “Maybe you were too loud” “he thinks you haven’t been working. He hates you. Your a lazy employee, u shouldn’t have been up there” all this bullshit and I know it’s bullshit

I hate that my mind is this way",15Aug2019,1
29,"So one week ago i started having this obsession that maybe i was gay, i was always asking myself if i were gay, which im pretty sure im not, that came up until yesterday when somehow my brain replaced these thoughts with thoughts about suicide, NO IM NOT TRYING TO COMMIT IT, I NEVER WOULD.

30,"I know that nobody cares but... It’s 5 in the morning and I woke up ‘cause of a hangover, feeling suicidal. I googled some methods on how to kill myself but everything sounds so awful. So now it seems like there’s no way out...

I try so fucking hard to get better. I make daily plans to make sure I’m happy and productive, I challenge myself with new things to do and write down my goals to feel closer to achieving them. I try to exercise, I eat healthy, I go to work and try to do my best everyday.

And yet each day I feel like a failure. I talk to my boyfriend, I tell him that I need to stop drinking, smoking and I need more exercise in life to feel healthy. He always tells me that he would help me with it, but then does the right opposite. The past days I asked him to go running with me, but he bagged me to hang out with his friends ‘cause he didn’t want to be alone with them . We’ve been drinking almost every day lately. I know I can’t blame him for how weak I am but it feels like he’s dragging me down and I need him to help me so much.

I’d found a therapist, paid a lot of money for the first sessions and at the last one she just told me: “yes, it’s hard’” and that was it. She wasn’t even listening to me.

Today I quit my job because of something seemingly meaningless but I can't forget it. Its burned into my head and I bash my head against the wall to try and find relief but it doesn't come. 

Over a fucking discount, a coworker thought I didn't want to give it to her and I freaked the fuck out and left on the spot. Even now I feel steamed over it, unbelievably angry.

I hate being walked over, but I always feel the deepest regret after I say the things I do and I want to apologize but I'm tired because all I've down in my life is apologize for this searing anger that takes over and dictates my actions. I have no money and no backup plan and I keep burning bridges because of my fucking mind and it's temper. I can't die because of the guilt of what I'd leave behind but how do I live with this. It's so hard dude. 

And that was just over a small thing. When a big thing happens I get cold sweats , I feel faint and it feels like my stomach turns inside out. I have to actively remain still so I don't break things and hurt myself. 

I cry so often now I pass it off as allergies and hope people don't ask because I can't ever explain why to people who either don't give a fuck or would never understand. I can't afford help, I want it so badly but I'm afraid if it and I avoid it. I don't want anyone to care about me so I can just diebut I can't so I just live in this purgatory of every one of my passions or relationships being sucked away by my inability to do anything because of the crippling amount of effort it takes to do nothing.

I hate myself, I should've been married but I fucked it up like I have everything else in my life. I can't create, I can barely find the strength to pick up my phone sometimes. I want somebody to love me but I keep messing it all up. I'm so lonely. I'm afraid of any friends that I make and end up ignoring them. I don't know why I'm so scared all the time. 

I keep resetting my life because I'm afraid of success and now I just want to lie still without this raging impatience. I get it whenever I watch movies, play games, talk to people. I don't know how to find solace anymore without this horrible impatience. Goddamn dude, I just want to be sad and complacent at the very least. Fuck, life is so fucking hard. A half a year ago I took so much Benadryl I went blind for a little and thought it was the end, but I didn't feel impatient then. Fucked everything up.",15Aug2019,2

33,About 10 months ago I started dating the woman I know I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Last week I proposed to her and she's now my fiance. around a few months ago as I became more sure of how much she meant to me I started to chronically worry about how horrible it would be if anything bad ever happened to her and how hard it would be to pick up and move on with life. It's to the point now where every time we hang out I'm having these horrible thoughts and I can't shake them.

So a few months ago my gf was diagnosed with Bipolar after having her first manic episode. They hospitalized and put her on meds. The meds seemed to help a lot. However three days ago they switched the meds to something new. These past three days she’s acted so differently. She’s completely dull just not herself at all. She never seems excited or even really happy. 
Yesterday I asked if she wanted to break up and she said yes. Then today we talked again and she seemed unsure but still didn’t want to be together.

I just don’t get how everything can change so fast. I want to be with her so badly and help her. I can’t force her to be with me. I don’t know what to do or how to handle. It just seems so unfair this is happening.",15Aug2019,3

Anyway, I've been there since last december, and it's been okay. But on tuesday something happened and I just feel like I can't go there anymore. I won't go into detail what exactly happened, but I was super embarrassing, and just cried all day, and acted really annoying, and wouldn't talk to the nurses(not really right word) even though they kept trying to get me to talk to them. One of them said she felt like she was dealing with a kid with temper tantrum. I said to them that I don't want to go back there, but they made me promise I would come back today, since yesterday we had day off. But I just feel so embarrassed and ashamed, and I don't think I can face them. I just can't stop thinking what they must think of me now, how they probably hate me or talk about me what a idiot I was being. It all just makes me want to cry again. On one hand I want to still go there, because I have nothing else in my life right now and I don't know what else I would do.

36,"I am 24 with mild autism, and me and my ELDEST brother sean have really been making efforts to do better and bigger things with my life. 

My eldest sibling of 4 years. 

I have made several improvements in my adult life for the better part of a year now. 

My mom and my other MIDDLE brother (Ian who is 25) together  are paying me to stop smoking and (I also rarely consume alcohol excessively, since I did I haven't felt this happy, but then I was at the family cottage again this weekend. 


(Sean, 28) in any conflict or disagreement, when he wrongfully accused me of lying about something, most of the time, it really shouldn't be anything worth getting so upset over. or if it was already done and over with. 


Yet he repeatedly, When I am not lying about anything and he still makes comments anyway like 

""You're lying piece of shit"". 


Usually if I accidentally stutter or tounge-twist it. 

I have Mild Autism aswell (Autistic people are extremely talented with details and are intellectually honest). 

I today, being 24 years old who doesn't drink alcohol or smoke weed anymore. 

I have zero reason to lie about anything.  


When he says something hurtful once unintentionally that is not nice. 


When he deliberately says something hurtful. again that is mean.


When he repeatedly says for the past quarter-century. 


If you hear ""you're a lying piece of shit"" for the 200th time over and over again. When you were truly intellectually honest. By someone you love (My Brother). 


It can be emotionally traumatizing after a certain amount of time when it is done over repeatedly. That's why I just don't want to be around him anymore. 


I actually thought he was going to physically  attack me again (He jumped on me 5 years ago for something I said at the cottage and it was terrifying).  


This past weekend again, because I needed to use the washroom at 1am and was in an embarrassing situation and threw the towel at my face like a 3yo kid. (I was pissed....)



In 2007, I was really excited about a true dream I had about missing the bus to school. 


In his natural nature, called me a lying piece of shit. 


When this was a LEGIT Summer '07 dream I had. 


I remember I was 12 and crying in agony because I was so excited about and he shut it out for zero reason like a dick


I distinctly remember the '07 incident of him calling me out on my dream about missing the school bus. (I have had numerous memories over the years of missing the school bus) I'm sure someone can relate to that if they have  ever missed the bus to school before. 


I remember my 12-years-old and crying because I strongly disliked when he would do this intentionally (Abusive). 


and my Dad, in the summer of '07. 


Hey Sean, what am I thinking about right now? 


Sean: ""IdK""  


Dad: Exactly….


Immediately follwing turning 16 (July 28, 2011). He punched me in my moms van when he once again, accused me of lying about something not relevant (People with Autism are not good under pressure) yet he physically hit me, because he thought I was lying and I this happened more times than I can count were if I stuttered or tongue-twisted my response accidentally. and he did soemthing physical.

Me personally don't think should be doing that of stuff (physically) at 28. I am actually scared for my safety around him.

as Nathan Mackinnon would say ""that shit aint cool"" (As it most certainly is not). 

My brother is usally naturally a negative human being. 

He naturally has a negative outlook on those around he has always been like that since he was little. 

He views everyone as being dumber than himself and talks down on almost anyone around him and he became far more negative until his adolescence and early adulthood.  

I get it is in his nature. Which is absolutely fine. However I feel it is in my best interest to isolate myself from Him as best I can if he knows it's hurtful and says whatever the 


Not only is this bullying. But it is actually Abusive if it inflicts emotional pain on others


A stranger saying these things to me honestly don't mean Jack shit. 

200× over from someone you love can be devastating for some people. (I can relate). 


But me being 24, honestly can maturely say. 


I love him unconditionally as he will always be my big brother. 


But I feel it's in both of our best interests if we not be around each other at family gatherings because this cannot be ongoing any longer if we are not going to get along. 


Of Course I love him unconditionally and wish the best for him as he is my eldest sibling 


But for now, I need my own space. 

And best not be around eachother at family gatherings and ESPCIALLY OUR FAMILY COTTAGE.",15Aug2019,1
37,"I’ve been so irate this week, muttering to myself like an irritated little witch cursing out the people, myself included, that kept me from seeking help. It’s weird. For a lot of you I gather the stigma held you back. For me it was oddly normalizing everything I was going through. As I’m breaking down no matter what I’d say it was like I was just a selfish lazy drama queen who needed to suck it up. I wish that I’d confided more intelligently with my better half who dealt with severe depression and won. But the truth was I felt like there was nothing to confide. I was a lazy little bitch who didn’t fit some arbitrary standard of someone that society would grudgingly concede needed help. 

I’ve struggled almost all my life with random voices in my head. It’s gotten so bad I often can’t tell what was real conversation with an actual person and what was not. I’ve broken down twice at work now yelling back -at nothing. But earlier when I’d mention it I’d get this bullshit answer “oh that’s just your brain working stuff out. Everyone does that.”  

I started occasionally seeing things, albeit briefly- so far, or hearing bangs, glass breaking, or awful guttural words being said. I woke up turned to get up and see this awful rotting corpse looking right at me. I can still recall every detail. And more bullshit gets said “oh what about your sleep habits, your blood sugar is too high/low, what are you eating? Do you have any bad habits?” 
Seriously?! And as I’ve said ad nauseam today especially the healthy choice questioning KILLED me because I was never in bad shape and really stray from junk food. 

So this lazy selfish drama queen made even healthier choices, tried self helps, and I’m at something of a physical peak. Because I let those people define my lines. And here I am. My house of cards is demolished. My Better Half now has to pick me up. Has to reassure me for the twentieth time I don’t have a brain amoeba in one day. He has to help me camp out on the couch because if I go upstairs this angry lady will try and smash my head in with a rock and I’m in tears. Or the voices will shout me awake when I’m almost asleep. Sleep was my last bastion and escape and now that’s even gone. I’m so stupidly scared. 

So here I am. At 44. Finally going in one month to my first psychiatrist appointment. I didn’t have a bad childhood. I wasn’t abused. I didn’t witness anything horrific. I have a great marriage, beautiful kids, an awesome job. And this shit happened to me. I wonder.  Is that why all those people said those things? They didn’t want to believe that it could happen to someone who looked normal? That if I was ill it was my choice? 

TLDR don’t let society tell you what you need to have or be like in order to need help. I wish I’d gone for help years ago.",15Aug2019,7
38,"Hello everyone, I just want to make a quick disclaimer, I still working with my English so might see a lot of grammatical errros in this post, thank you.

Well, I’m a 20 years old and I feel at the edge of my life at this moment, It is really hard for me to engage with people and it is even hard for me to engage with my parents and my family. I’ve always been know for being a shy person, it’s really difficult to me to speak up my mind of to lookout after myself, I have a serious lack of self-esteem, I tend to talk I lot inside my mind but words never como out of my mouth.

Lately I’ve been thinking that all this is caused to a lack of a mother figure at home, and a lack of a paternal figure at home, just to set your mind for what is coming, when I think about my dad he seems like a Santa Claus for me and when I think about my mom she seems like a dictator. My dad was working in a foreign country just to give my mom and I better living conditions, he always send gifts to me, things such as clothing, toys, video games and whe I spoke with him over the phone it’s was just a “hi, how are you” conversation and I always asked him when he was coming back. That was the relationship I had with my dad when I was a child.
My mom was very lovely and she still lovely until these days, I know that by the way she take care of my little brother, but back in the days she had to work 5 days a week so I just saw her at the afternoons and she always came tired from work, thing really changed when I started to go to school, she became very strict with me, she wanted me to get good grades and all that stuff and if I get home with a bad grade she got really mad with me, sometimes she grabbed me from my ears and she pulled them or sometimes she. Said thing like I’m useless or when I was crying sometimes she called me fag, she was always in control of my life. 

These past three months I’ve been going throughout an emotional roller coaster. Sometimes I feel happy, most of the time I feel sad and anxious, and sometimes I’m introspective which is something new to me, well I think this bad relationship with my parents is the root of all my problems, I know that I’m not perfect and sometimes I’ve been rude to them, awfully rude that made my mom cry occasionally, and that makes me feel bad, there are more thing that I’d like to tell you but I don’t want to turn this post into a testament or a suicide note to my parents.

I want to fix this situation but I don’t found the strength to sit down and talk with my parents, my uncle from mom’s side has recently died in a accident and I don’t want to put more pressure over her,  I love my parents I know they been trying to do the best for me but I don’t know what parental love is and I have some serious thrust issues.

40,"Sorry for the long text but here it goes

For context my girlfriend has been depressed for a while now after her father's death nearly 2 years ago (we've been dating for 14 months, and known each other for about as much) and latelly it has been hitting her really hard and she started thinking about death regularly and crying about it. After her father passed away she went to live with her brother, who lived in a sepparate appartment on the same city. Since this started she is also very explosive at me, getting really mad at me for what I feel are tiny things that could be easily solved with just a little talking but she just shuts down and doesn't talk to me and starts pushing me away, I try to kiss her and make her talk but she starts screaming ""don't touch me"" and ""get out"" and after some hours of this she cracks or sometimes only on the next day and she cries about it and starts saying we should break up. 

Right now her brother had to to the their father's town which is very far away so she has been alone at home for a few days.

Yesterday she had one of those breakdowns while we were at the local park and she just stormed out to her home not talking to me and I followef all the way and tried getting in with her but she started hitting me a lot screaming for me to get out, so I just told her to text me. I waited several hours and no text from her so I decided to send her a cute photo of a dog I had found on reddit and she blocked me on all social media. This morning I went to her house and rang her bell for an hour after which she opened but wouldn't let me in saying it was all over and for me to go away but I eventually managed to get inside and she just started hitting me a lot and screaming at me and then just went to her room laying in bed watching tv. After several hours of trying to make her talk, crying a lot only ""get out"" as an answer she hugged me. After a long hug she said she still tought we should break up and started shutting down again after which I had to go home because my parents wanted to go dinner out and asked her to text me.

After a while she texted me a photo of her having a bath (with the bathtub full of water which she never does) asking me to go there later to talk. Then I invited her to come dinner with me and my parents and we all went and it all was feeling much better, she obviously wasn't well but was much better and talked to me and grabbed my hand and hugged me.

After some shopping we went home and played some video games online and then started watching an episode of a series (on a voice call with each other) and halfway through she started crying saying she doesn't want me to go away (CONTEXT: my parent decided to remodel the house and we have to go away on vacation for 3 weeks while the work is being done) crying a lot, saying she doesnt want to be alone and I was trying to confort her but she just left the call shortly after. I don't want to go on this vacation either, I am being forced to by my parents (I am going in just 2 days).

After that I tried texting her and she answered she had cut herself with a knife today. At this point I got really worried and started trying to make her talk and she said she was fine, she hadn't managed to hurt herself as much as she wanted to. Then she said she had filled the bathtub because she was thinking of drowning herself and she also tought of swallowing a bunch of pills. Then I tried taking to her, telling her to talk to me and never do this again but she said she was sleepy and said bye and went to sleep.

It's nearly 5 am now and I don't know what to do, I'm so worried for her and her mental health and I need help to bring her back to life. Her mental state right now is really bad and I'm afraid something really bad might happen.

Please someone tell me what to do",15Aug2019,10

42,"so long story short, i met this guy back in october, our first year in college, and we became really really close friends, but i had a crush on him, i decided to not tell him i had a crush on him because he was very affectionate and i enjoyed the affection, gradually my mood got worse and worse due to him never liking me back, he broke up with his girlfriend on april of this year, and i waited until he finished therapy and was feeling better to tell him my feelings, so i could either be with him or start the process of moving on, he rejected me, it was ok for a couple of months, but close to summer we started having heavy problems, fights and arguments, and it all started because of an apology letter inwrote him for all the bad stuff i did before that point, he was mad about me not telling him that i liked him, and continued to receive his affection, he said that i was using him and that i grossed him out, that there was never a moment in the friendship where i didnt use him, and thats when he blocked me out of everything, he said he didnt wanna continue this friendship even if it wasnt as close as before, and blocked me

our summer plans consisted of us 2 taking the same calculus class, he switched to the morning period while i stayed on the afternoon period, the thing is, yhe 2 groups made a group chat of all the students, sp we could help each other, and he was there, i was fairly active on it and he was not as active but fairly active as well, and he talked and responded to me as normal, like if nothing ever happened, he even helped me a ton on certain things to look out for, thing is, when the class was done, 0 communication, he left the group chat and slowly but steadily i witnessed as he slowly deleted me on all other social medias that we shared, snapchat, facebook, i still had him on psn and on facebook

by the end of the second month of summer, he texted me because i had his account information on my psn because we shared games, and he wanted the acces back to give it to his cousin, i gave it to him, and then he unfriended me like a week later...

2 weeks before the start of college he blocked me on facebook.. i saw him when i went to pay for my tuition, and i saw him with his old crush he used to tell me about, my stomach sinked because i thought they were dating... and i dont think i can bear that honestly.. i greeted both of them and continued my way, a week before collegr started he unblocked me, but im still blocked on messenger. that confused me.. but i payed no mind to that, sometimes i see him talking and walking with his crush and it really scares me...

now that college started (we have ALL of our classes together), the first class he saw me he greeted me all enthusiastically like he did when we were friends, and he talks to me super normal, and tries to keep a conversation going, all the while ignoring everything that happened as if it didnt happen.. were still not as before obviously, i cross him when im walking around campus and we dont even look at each other, but when were ""forced"" to be together due to mutual friends, he talks like normal, today he even waited for me while i talked to a professor... i honestly dont know what to do.. i went to see if i could get a session with the college psychologist but the session isnt until tuesday the 27th... what im currently doing is going along with it.. ignoring the situation and talking to him like normal... but i dont know if thats the correct thing to do... i dont know how i feel about this whole thing because i cried a summer and mentally prepared for him to ignore me this semester, not talk to me... and now im really at a loss, im scared that if i say anything about the subject he might get scared off and stop talking to me for good, because maybe hes not good at resolving issues and thats why hes ignoring it.. but i cant shake off everything he said to me when he stopped talking to me.. all of my suffering for it to magically not matter to him... i dont know what to do until i go to my therapist on tuesday... i dont wanna do the wrong thing here... i dont think i could handle it",15Aug2019,1

I’m living with two roommates and trying to scrape by on my shitty minimum wage paycheck working full time with OT 5 days a week PLUS going to school the other two days. I feel like I’m fucking drowning, everyone. 
I’ve had a tough upbringing with a drug addict father and my mother (who I love dearly) has since moved to Florida and I rarely see her and it breaks my heart. My sister lives out on LI and very rarely comes to see me- I know she loves me but she has a hard time showing it and is a very superficial person. 
I live with two people, one who’s my best friend and the other who’s a decently close friend. My best friend and I rarely talk about mental health as I feel he’s uncomfortable with the topic and I don’t want to bother him. The other roommate I feel like she doesn’t even like me. 
I don’t really have friends outside of them besides my coworkers who I consider my family but even then they all have lives and issues of their own and I don’t want to burden them. 
I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression all of my life but lately it’s gotten to the point where I don’t know what the fuck to do. I feel like nothing really brings me happiness anymore and if I do become happy in the moment, I realize it’s fleeting and the happiness just goes away. I don’t have health insurance because my job pays me literal shit and I wanted to go to the hospital tonight bc I’m having some really crappy thoughts and I just need fucking help but I can’t even afford that. I really don’t know what the fuck to do anymore. 
I’m sorry for writing this long post and I hope it’s not upsetting for anyone but I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I feel so fucking numb. I really need help and am grasping at straws right now at this point. Can anyone just point me in the right direction??? 

Thank you.",15Aug2019,1
46,"I’m 21, M, from BC, Canada. I was diagnosed with Autism when I was 3.

So earlier this month I posted on r/advice about how my thoughts sometimes like to invade and make really scared for my future. Thoughts like climate change and things I did in the past I heavily regret. 

This evening I was taking a nap, and literally couldn’t get out of bed because I was petrified about my future, how it would be due to climate change and if I’d live to see old age. 

Now, I’m not even trying to get political, that’s literally what I was thinking about.

Reflecting back on it, this behaviour has been going on for almost a year now. When my brain goes on idle mode (not thinking about anything in particular), it immediately goes to something bad, and recently that bad thing has been climate change. 

It leaves me dreadful and scared a good half the time and I shove it back in my head only for it to reappear again.

I’ll be calling my doctor soon, and seeing if there’s anything I can do, because honestly it’s becoming unbearable, and I can feel myself not enjoying things anymore because of this.

Maybe I’m just overworrying, maybe there is something wrong with me. I’m not sure. But I’m getting worried for my own mental health.

If you have any advice, please feel free to sound off below.",15Aug2019,2
47,"Hi, I had a bit of a terrible vacation this summer, honestly everything happened 2 
 months ago now, but some things have stuck in my mind. Sorry if the formatting/grammar is bad im on mobile and it's 12 in the morning. Im just confused and probably over-thinking. Sorry it's long. 

Mainly this is about an argument between me and my sister whom I love dearly. I know she couldn't sleep during the vacation at all and couldn't smoke as much as she normally does, so she was on edge. (My mother and her would constantly bicker and I was the reason we had the vacation in the first place so I felt extremely guilty of it.) So when she finally popped, I was sort of expecting it. 

She yelled at me and even pointed out some of my insecurities. I didn't say anything. I couldn't really reply at all, I was completely mute and just silently sobbing as she accused me of some of her own insecurities as well. (She told me I didn't want to take pictures of her because she was ugly, which was extremely untrue, but again I was mute at this point and couldn't say anything which made me feel even worse.)

 But the strange part was, when she was done yelling and she walked past me I was expecting her to hit me. (We used to be spanked when we were children but it's been a very long time since that happened and I feel like a lot of people did back then?) And even stranger was when she didn't I felt worse. A sort of deep-seeded feeling of loss is what I would describe the feeling as. Just hollowness like I'd rather have felt pain than nothing at all. (I have no history of self harm) It was as if I wanted her to hit me, that I, in some way, deserved being hit. 

Looking back on it now that seems ridiculous, and i don't know why I thought that and it's been on my mind for a while. I was just wondering why I would feel this? Could someone help me rationalize whatever the heck I was thinking at that point? It's worrying me. Thank you for anyone reading this anyway, I feel like I needed to vent and I think if I told anyone i knew personally it would probably bring more concern than I'd want.",15Aug2019,1

49,"My son was born july 5th 2018 by emergency c section because of preeclampsia. Long story short, i ended up with severe postpartum depression because of feeling like i failed him in some way. Because of this i had an emotional break down on july 14th 2018. I lived with my boyfriend, his mother and step father. They treated me well until after my son was born. That was when i became less then dirt to them. I was no longer important in their eyes. And ever since then I have been fighting so hard to be my sons mother again. I lost custody and cps got involved and has been for a year. My now ex and his parents have verbally and emotionally abused me ever since my son was born. I had court today and was told by the judge that the custody and my supeervised visits will NEVER change. I have been fighting postpartum depression for just over a year now. It has even drastically effected my physical health. I cant fight anymore. 

To anyone that reads this ... 

Postpartum depression is NOT helped by taking a new moms baby from her entirely. It actually has the opposite effect. She needs HELP. She doesnt need to be PUNISHED.

And to CPS and the family court system ...

You went too far. Im sure im not the only one who you have made suffer. You need to seriously reform many of your procedures and policies. Because you have cost my baby boy the healthy happy mom he deserved.

50,"Hi I'm new to this sub so sorry if this doesn't fit the vibe.... I'm just seeking advice for my own mental health stuff

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and OCD for most of my life, I think a ton of it goes back to middle or elementary school age fwiw. I have been working so hard on my mental health recently and I've been so lucky to find myself in a place where I have access to good mental health care and support. Thanks to medications and therapy I have managed to get on top of the worst of my ocd, have lifted myself out of the grips of some really negative shit, and got a little better at dealing with my chronic abandonment anxiety which has blighted my relationships with others

But I'm still struggling and it's so frustrating. I just can't see the good or happiness in my life. It doesn't seem worth it. It's not that it's unbearable. I just cannot for the life of me find any joy in life. I'm 28 and I'm struggling to find something that brings me any positivity Of course there's so much that I haven't tried, but I feel like the problem is really with me. Right now I just feel like I'm stalling time until my life is done, like I'm just putting one foot in front of the other in the hope that eventually I can just be done idk

I have had so many frustrating conversations where people try to suggest things to me and it's just invariably the same: I don't want to do those things. I know that this is depression that's sapping at me. I just feel like my neurochemistry is broken and it doesn't make me happy. I've tried talking to therapists and psychiatrists, I've taken more different prescriptions than I can name, but it never goes away

One thing that does bring me joy is being with friends. But I have few friends and those that I can count on are 1000s of miles away. My therapist suggested to me today that I just never learned how to self-soothe or how to entertain myself. And it's true. When I'm on my own, if I'm not working I just have nothing. She suggested that for various reasons I just didn't go through those developmental stages when I was younger. That feels right to me. And it's toxic because it makes me codependent and needy in my relationships which invariable ends up destroying them :( and I'm anxious and introverted, I can't be myself unless I really know a person and meeting new people is torturous. With my true friends I can feel happiness sometimes, but strangers are worse than nothing

I'm wondering if anyone can please please please help me with advice or resources. How do you learn to entertain yourself, to stimulate yourself when you're depressed and literally nothing appeals and nothing has ever appealed??? how do I even make a start here? I am at an absolute loss, I want soooo hard to help myself get better. But I just don't know how I can progress, I don't know how to begin. without the stimulation of talking and laughing with others I just can't have fun, I am at a total loss, my therapist is angry and frustrated with me, my psychiatrist has run out of ideas, my poor friends are overburdened, I would love to be able to care more for myself I just don't know how to make a start :(",15Aug2019,1

53,"There certainly is a place for such activities, but in my experience, those serve more as temporary quick fixes.

I have found far more benefit in using those when necessary, but also instilling the daily practices that will help me not to need to do them in the first place.   


For me, that is daily meditation, exercise, establishing a bedtime and morning routines and of course regular therapy.  


Do I still need 'traditional' self care? Of course, but my need is decreasing the more I spend time on self improvement and growth.  


I started with one minute per day and went from there. The time came from all of the mental space I was saving and the spoons subsequently gained.

54,"I’m a 15 y/o male and a sophomore in high school. For over a year now, I’ve been struggling with severe suicidal depression and anxiety. I’ve also been struggling with really bad impulsiveness as far back as I can remember. I’ve done many horrible things that I regret, and I feel terrible for doing then. One thing that has been occurring for the past year that worries me more is increasing homicidal thoughts. Since the latter half of eighth grade, I’ve had increasingly common thoughts of killing people, whether it be murder or mass murder. For a while, these thoughts were uncommon, and only really occurred when major events like mass shootings happened. However, in the past month or so, these thoughts have become almost daily. They also have become more and more intense, and now whenever these thoughts occur I feel an intense urge to kill. I have severe anger issues, yet my anger rarely triggers my homicidal thoughts and urges. Usually they occur more when I am feeling depressed and lonely. I recently told my mom about my mental health issues, and she has been helping me improve somewhat. However, I recently asked about seeing a psychiatrist because I want to get a professional opinion about my mental health. However, my mom seems to believe that mental health issues can all be solved by sleeping more and being more positive and friendly. Due to this, she basically said no to seeing a therapist. While I do acknowledge that this can help, it has not done enough for my mental help. I don’t want to tell my mom about my homicidal thoughts because I don’t want her to just think I’m overreacting or tell me to sleep more. How can I keep my urges in check so I don’t end up impulsively hurting or killing someone? Thanks!",15Aug2019,1

This one guy in particular (I'll call him L) has stuck with her since the website they met on shut down. They've never met, but they know a lot about each other, and she must have talked about me, because he followed me on social media. A while after he followed my private Instagram, he noticed the posts I'd make when I was upset. Vulgar captions about hating myself and my situation, because it's the only way I cope. L DM'ed me after a couple of them. He sincerely tried to help. He looked into the mental health resources in my school district, and my town, and things of that nature. However, when I said I'd try to do something about it (which was a lie because I was and am still too cowardly to do anything about this,) he said something I don't think I'll forget.

""Don't just let those feelings sit. I've watched so many people think 'oh I'm fine I don't need all that stuff' and just suffer in silence as their mental illness slowly consumes them.""

That's exactly what I did.

I've sat here and quivered. Now, a good few months later, I'm suffering even more than I was, and I'm still refusing to do anything about it because I can't bring myself to calmly describe my constant varying state of emotional distress to anyone. The thought of this makes me upset. I sometimes have that thought of not having to deal with the effects of reality if I'm dead. I'd never do it, but I do think about it. I've always assumed it's par the course. I don't actually know, though. That's a fear, too; not knowing things, and being afraid that my mental illness will be discredited because *I* know I'm suffering, but since there's nothing for me to prove it with, no one will believe me.

L was right. When you do nothing, nothing happens and your mental illness slowly pulls you in until you're immersed in the putrid pool of garbage. I don't know if I'm fully there yet, but the nausea I feel during the deepest, darkest bits as of late probably says something.

I don't even know. I'm not looking for suggestions, because as I've proved, I don't do anything to improve myself. But I hope this story made you feel something. I'm not sure what the point of this was besides venting, so I hope I'm not breaking any rules with this post.",15Aug2019,11

Throwaway because I don’t want the people following my main to think I’m insane. Also crossposting from /r/mentalillness since this subreddit is more popular and I'm more likely to get the answer I'm craving.

Last night I had an anxiety attack where I started to question myself for living. I remember I was venting to a friend and then suddenly I started hearing a voice in my head threatening me to hurt myself. They wanted me to bite myself for being worthless. I was really breaking down at this point to my friend and then I remember just...snapping. I started talking in a different PoV to my friend, I was conscious but I couldn’t control what I was saying to her. I typed things like ‘She (as in myself) is worthless and I’m taking over from here’ and ‘You’re so funny that you care about such an idiot haha’, basically harassing myself and scaring my friend. My heart was racing and I couldn’t control anything anymore but I was still there, I could see everything. Then I kept switching back and forth and I really scared my friend.

It eventually ended after 45 minutes of constantly switching but I’ve never heard of anything like this and I’m scared of myself. I’m scared of harming myself when I’m not in control, yet can see everything. Does anyone know what mental illness this can possibly fall under?

I always worry a lot and to be honest I have a few self esteem issues to say the least and when I feel like this it's amazing because I feel invincible. All my problems are washed away on an ocean current of nothingness and it feels so good. I guess what I really want to ask aside from my main question is what's the worst that could happen if I were to encourage this coping mechanism?

64,"About two and a half weeks ago I was prescribed the generic for SEROquel for my Bipolar symptoms.  I've had vivid dreams and even some lucid dreaming before, but very rarely.  Recently I've started having vivid, fantastical dreams pretty much every night.  Usually they're average or kind of cool (definitely enjoyed the one where I was a secret operative running along the top of a monorail through a future city while chasing vampires) but some of them are really terrible such as my nightmare last night about planes crashing, fires, and the end of the world.  I generally wake up and realize it was a dream so no huge deal, but in the last three days or so I started having a new symptom, hypnagogic hallucinations.

I didn't know what had happened at all but I told a friend about it and he suggested waking dreams, aka hypnagogic hallucinations, where your brain continues to manufacture visual, auditory, or tactile sensations while awake.  Similar to sleep paralysis though you're not actually paralyzed.  On Sunday I was napping and kept waking up over and over or dreaming I was waking up over and over.  I also had such a vivid dream of two of my room mates coming in and having a discussion with me and between one another that I thought it had actually happened until I asked them about it when I got up because it seemed odd that they'd have come in while I was napping to talk.  The worst part was at one point I woke up thinking someone had walked into the room.  I assumed it was my room mate whose room I was napping in because I sleep on the couch and we had guests over in the living room.  I looked towards the end of the bed and saw an indistinct, dark figure with glowing red eyes.  It freaked me out so I covered my face but though that maybe it was still him and I was seeing the reflection of the clock on his glasses.  So I called out, ""Who's there"" and heard his voice reply ""Just me"" then I felt someone climb into bed with me.  Something didn't feel right, so I stuck out my elbow to nudge where he should have been laying and there was nothing there but pillows.  I noped right out of the bedroom then to go and hang out with my roomies and our company and the roomie I thought had come in was out there with them.  He denied coming into the room, so all I could figure is that I was having some kind of hallucination or waking dream.  Today I took a nap again and kept waking up, the last time I woke up I didn't have any hallucinations but had such a strong 'bad feeling' that I got up immediately and ran out of the bedroom.  I also sometimes have strange floating sensations when drifting off to sleep like I'm hovering or rocking like on a boat or wake up thinking I've heard a very loud sound like thunder or something falling even though it isn't storming and nothing has fallen over.  I've believe this so strongly a couple of times in the past that I went to check on my boyfriend thinking he'd fallen or something.  I have no hallucinations of any kind during active wakefulness.  


I started thinking more about it, trying to decide if this was some new symptom I was experiencing and realized that I've had these sorts of hallucinations when falling asleep or as I was waking up before in the past, particularly during times of excess stress such as when my dad and stepmom were going through a nasty divorce and when I was living with a verbally abusive roomie in college.  It actually made me think my house was haunted at one point because I kept hearing footsteps, thudding, feeling like someone was in my bed, or seeing human figures in my room.  I recall being very frightened during most of them, though sometimes I was only puzzled and at least once the figure I saw was angelic and I was subtly delighted until I woke up fully and realized how unnatural that was.  


The side effects listed for my medication include causing vivid dreams or worsening of other conditions such as night terrors or sleep paralysis but I didn't see anything about it causing or worsening waking dreaming.  Has anyone else experienced this?  It's affected my sleep for the last couple of nights because I'm afraid I'm going to have another frightening hallucination.",15Aug2019,1
65,"I feel like I've screwed up my chance at getting better with a psychologist already and all I've done is talk to them on the phone for a few minutes. It's the first psychologist I've ever made an appointment to see. 

I was referred to one yesterday after speaking to the GP about my mental health for the first time (big step, so glad I did it though) and the psychologist phoned me today to book an appointment. She asked if I was working at the moment, and I'm so embarrassed by the fact that I'm not working that I've just been telling people I still work. So I said I do, but very casually so it's difficult to specify. But that's a life, I haven't worked in over a year - and when I did, it was just casual work. Last year I only worked a few days. But I get so anxious about being judged for this, I've just conditioned myself to tell anyone who asks that yes I work but only casually while I'm finishing my studies, despite it being a straight up lie (the work is a lie. I am studying, but only have the final subject to go this semester. No idea how I'm going to do anything with my life after this due to being anxious about every single thing, but I guess that's why I'm seeing a psychologist lol). 

Now I'm worried I've ruined the relationship with the psychologist already and I won't be able to talk about the intense anxiety, fear and depression I get from things like work and how I desperately want to apply for a get a decent job, but I'm like paralysed with fear, anxiety, self conscious issues and worst case scenario thoughts when I try and apply. 

Just wanted to vent about how I've fucked up already! The main thing I want to address is how much the anxiety and depression have impacted my ability to work and find a job, but now I feel like I can't talk about that.

I am not suicidal but I have no interest in doing things to make sure I stay healthy (like getting sleep and food) and if I died right now I'd be ok with that.

I am almost always tired but that's always been the case ever since I was young.

Since seven months I've been working as a temporary in catering. The job itself isn't amazing but they people I work with are really nice and sweet, and often tell me how glad they are that I'm there, even though in my past jobs I was always the dumb one. And this job usually just takes three hours a day. You'd think I wouldn't mind going to work, especially because once I'm there it's not so bad.

But I do mind. I never want to go to work. I just want to lay in bed and sleep, or go on my laptop and waste my time on there.
I keep telling myself it's just three hours, the people are nice, I've gotten kind of okay at the job and know what to do most of the time, so I can do this.
But I often just feel like I don't have the energy to do that, and afterwards I always lay on the couch for an hour or so because while the job isn't hard, it's pretty exhausting.

I often consider staying home for a day just because 'mental health comes first' but if I were to do that I'd do that every day.

69,"I am speaking mainly about the sub /r/Getmotivated - a very popular sub with 15 million subscribers that offers up bubbly inspirational &amp; motivational quotes and messages. I have no doubt the sub is filled with good intentions, and perhaps it helps a lot of people. If it has helped you, that's excellent, but I've never got any kind of uplifting boost or made any changes in my life based on an inspirational quote. Messages of ""you can do it"" or ""just believe in yourself"" do nothing for me, and never have. I don't know if it's just because I'm a pessimistic person, or if it's because I'm a realist.

Just wondering how other people feel about motivational quotes and the like.",15Aug2019,6
70,"English is not my first language.

So I'll try and keep this short. 4 years back my life crashed down after a family death paired with other bad stuff happening to me and I got my first panic attack while on a train. After that public transportation was kind of a problem for me but I got around alright and in time the attacks would just happen while I was on long distance trains.

During my first vacation after the attacks started I developed obsessive thoughts due to the stress of being away from home. They involve my head feeling strange and out of place and the thought of my brain being inside my skull gives my anxiety. It happens occasionaly and I'm scared I'll become unfunctional at one point. 

Is therapy going to help in this matter? And what kind of therapy should I seek out? Anyone have similar problems. I'm feeling kind of alone with this one. I'm also a hypochondriac regarding these things so I'm not sure wether to let it rest or not. Hope this is the right sub to post.",15Aug2019,4
71,"Firstly, a bit of backstory. I'm sorry for the wall of text.

I've been seeing this girl for about a month now, she suffers from anxiety, depression and PTSD from a previous relationship and bit of childhood trauma. Apart from this baggage, it's been good, I used to drive two hours to see her after work and we would generally have lots of fun. There was always a bit of baggage, with arguments happening because of her paranoia, and past memories being brought with some things about me that remind her of her past relationship, which I get it, fair enough, we tried to look past it and talk about it when we can but at the end of the day it never really helped.

Fast forward about 3 weeks, at this point we are arguing at least once a day, mainly with her telling me that I make her feel like shit and trying to break it off me with saying things like ""you can't handle me"", and ""it's better for the both of us"". Normally after this she'll come around and act like there was nothing ever wrong. Up until this point, this has happened 4 times. She cries when I leave her house, making me feel guilty, constantly tells me that I never want to see her, even though I have made the 2 hour drive to see her constantly and she has not once ever offered to come visit me.

She told me about how she tried to overdose on Panadol when she a lot younger, which stuck with me. At this stage we are getting in arguments about me not being overly affectionate towards her (which I believe I have) and being distant, however this is mainly due to my job and the stress it's putting on me, and it doesn't help that i'm constantly run down from driving to see her and not really having any time to myself. On top of that i'm driving well over an hour to get to work where I do 12 hour shifts.

Today, we got into another argument about me being in a hurry to leave, which of course sparked a bigger argument and then the anxiety and mental health issues came out to play. She tried to break it off with me yet again, and with this draining me and exhausting me even more, I agreed. I told her how I feel. How hard it is for me to keep her happy when all she does it tell me that I make her feel like shit. I'm stuck in this weird situation where I find myself getting more and more frustrated about things she has no control over, but at the end of the day it's still very hard for me.

She almost got into a car accident earlier in the day. After we both agreed to stop seeing each other, she told me she wanted to take a Xanax so she doesn't feel, wish she got crushed by the car earlier, and then tried to call me by saying she is suicidal. Due to my job, I have a duty of care over people regardless when i'm working, so I did the one thing I thought was right. I called the police to do a concern for welfare on her. I feel bad for doing it, but I was honestly worried and scared seeing that i'm so far away. I messaged her friend and told her what I've done only to be absolutely berated, with her saying, ""This is not how you help people with mental health issues"", and saying this is going to make everything a thousand times worse. She told me to call the police and call it off but unfortunately that's not how it works.

I'm worried this is going to affect her living situation and compound her mental health issues. I was the one she relied on to feel better, and while I wasn't the most helpful, I have been trying. Her friend believes this is going to ruin her living situation seeing as her house is connected to her landlords. I've tried to reassure her that it won't but now I feel as if I've just made a stupid rash decision based on what she said to me. But I can't help but think I absolutely did the right thing.",15Aug2019,1
72,"At 16 my aunt became my legal guardian and I moved in with her and her partner (let’s call him Guy). He has 2 sons who live in about 2.5 hours away from us. One of Guys sons has done really well for himself. The other, (lets call him Ted) just seems to have wasted every opportunity thrown his way. 

Guy has got Ted 2 or 3 different apprenticeships, each time he got fired. He was thrown out of the army. At 21, he got with a woman who already had 4 kids and got her pregnant. At 20 weeks pregnant, they had a fight and he kicked her in the stomach, he claims it was an accident but he ended up with 6 months in prison. Soon after all this his mum died which he took very badly.   

Since all this he got back together with his gf and it’s been nothing but more fights, hatred, more dead end jobs, big debt - everyone else in their family has given up on him. Everyone has tried to help but he just seems to be on a mission to set fire to everything good in his life.  

In the last 2 years, Ted has tried to commit suicide 3 times, the last being last night. Each time he writes an epic suicide note to his gf, goes off and drinks anti-freeze. The first time he was in a coma for several days. The second time he actually didn’t drink as much as the time before but was still hospitalized. Last night he went missing in the woods and was found by police, he’s now in hospital.   

Ted obviously needs major help but refuses any medication, therapy etc. I don’t really know him very well but Guy was absolutely going out of his mind last night as expected, we all think he needs to be sectioned to get help he needs but apparently the hospital haven’t offered this and keep discharging him. Does anyone know, in the UK, what they need to go to get Ted sectioned so he can finally get professional help?  Thanks very much",15Aug2019,4
73,"Hi folks. 

So a couple weeks ago, my young cousin (just started high school) was present for one of the mass shootings here in the US. They heard the first shots fired (even heard a young child remarking about the shots, saying they were firecrackers), and booked it when they realized what was happening. 

They heard everything. 

They were a few hours away from home, and of course the area was on lockdown, so they couldn't go home right away. They eventually returned, safe and unharmed, a few hours later. 

Their mother (single parent, my father's sister) refuses to talk about it with them (to be fair, they don't know English all that well). They wrote the entire description of the events down on paper, and gave it to people to read if they wanted to. They're pretty quiet usually, but my sibling and I can sense that they are incredibly shaken up about it. My father even knows how distressed they are.

However, both their mother and my father seem to refuse counseling or any sort of therapy for them. My sibling and I have begged them to consider it and at least give them \*the choice\* of talking to someone (because this is their decision to make). We don't know what their healthcare situation is (their mother is unemployed) so we don't even know if anything is available for them. My father says he'll handle it, but he's dragging his feet, that's if he's doing anything at all. They're going to the same high school my sibling and I went to, and we know that the counselors there are overwhelmed because of the sheer number of students they have to handle (several hundred per counselor).

Both my sibling and I are full-time college students, and I'm home maybe 80-90 non-continuous days of the year. We're going to try to provide support for them if they want it, and we're giving them some material goods (some electronics, new clothes, etc) for Christmas this year (them and their mother don't have working income, and usually rely on my family and hand-me-downs for belongings).

Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I should do? Any and all help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.",15Aug2019,109

Reguardless, she mentioned a situation when I was around 8-9 years old that I personally only remember glimpses of. Either way it was enough to confirm what me and my father thought to be true.

I have moments going upstairs where by the top i'm almost sprinting because half way up it felt as if i was being chased, and even when looking back to confirm theres nothing there, I still have to keep sprinting, and sometimes even run faster. It also happens more frequently in the dark, every time I go into my kitchen I see a shape in the dark on the floor, turn on the lights, and am terrified of it jumping at me, even though I can see there's really nothing there. As for a non moving example, sometimes just laying in bed I can see shapes standing in my room in the dark for seconds at a time, and in the light I can only ever see them in my peripheral vision.

79,"Finally! I found a therapist that isn't overbooked and agreed on having weekly sessions with me. I can't describe how much this means to me, so I want to make sure that she's a good fit and I won't be wasting my time.

To be honest, nothing about her personality struck me during our consultation. Maybe because she was trying to get to know me first and didn't reveal any of her opinions just yet. Realistically, nothing negative stood out either. It was just a neutral experience. What I noticed though, was that I opened up to her within seconds and didn't have trouble speaking my heart out the whole time. It's just that I didn't get any feedback from her, she was just writing things down as I was flooding her with a nonstop flow of new information. 

I also have to mention that we don't share the same first language and she's from a different culture that I'm now a part of, if that has any importance.

So what should I do? Does the therapist have to ""click"" right away or feeling neutral is good enough to start?",15Aug2019,2
80,"Hi, so I’m a student in high school (specifically Senior) and school just started for me. I’ve been told it’s about time to look into local colleges and take courses, but in reality i don’t want to go to college, if i were to go to college I’d only go for the satisfaction of my parents. That stresses me out a lot and I’m sitting here crying over this and how hypocritical my dad can be about it (He’s advocating and encouraging me the most). It’s great to know that if I go to college I don’t have to end up like him, but due to the fact I’d most likely be in debt I want to save my mother money, I don’t want to go. She had a different life growing up. Her mom bought, class pictures, class rings, etc. for her and her siblings. She tried to get me to “Book a session for pictures, but a ring” and I told her repeatedly “I don’t want it cuz I don’t care about my image”. Plus to add on it, I never wanted to go to college in the first place. I’m starting to think “Do I want a degree or do my parents?”

For starters, my dad did very bad decisions, so much so that he ended up back stabbing my mom and not bother helping her raise me and my sisters. I knew he wanted me to go to college ever since I started high school. In fact, right as this year started he said “You gotta start looking up colleges, apply for scholarships, anything” and scholarships usually require certain class to take in HS and no one, EVER said anything about it. I have a feeling I’m in the wrong here and just start my search for colleges. It sucks so much, to give satisfaction to someone when you didn’t want to give it to them. I’m so close to a mental breakdown and i can’t bare listening to him and his hypocrisy, he hurt me and I don’t what to do.",15Aug2019,2

I'm not severely underweight, maybe 4-5kg, but I usually barely eat one meal per day and have very severe body dismorphia. It has been like this for the past 2 years, crappy, unhealthy but at least pretty stable.

A couple months ago I started taking antipsychotics for BPD and they massively messed up with my eating habits. Olanzapine made me binge and purge like no tomorrow, abilify gave me a horrible ""boredom"" hunger and now quetiapine is keeping me snacking on junk food all day long and making my body dismorphia even worse.

The most frequent culprit is a feeling of general emptiness, worthlessness, and lacking of motivation to do anything. Not to mention a temper when it came to some minor inconveniences (never person related though) In the last few months I had grown fearful for my own sanity and started doubting it too. I regularly heard voices and saw humanoid figures in places before disappearing in the blink of an eye. I remember a voice that is completely indescribable saying ""you're not going to win this"" it had terrified me as I was about to fall asleep and was wide awake after hearing that, it took me multiple hours to calm down enough to relax.

Mostly because I am unsure if everyone in the group even wants to hear what I have to say and it makes me really anxious. I feel like I'm saying the wrong thing or being too loud/ talking too much. 

In order to feel comfortable at parties or gatherings, I usually arrive first or early if a close friend is hosting.  That way,  I can meet people as they arrive and have the one on one conversations I'm comfortable with and still make appearances so people don't think I'm avoiding them. 

Socializing for me is super tiring, and since i arrive early or right at the beginning, I usually want to leave early. (Especially if I end up sitting awkwardly in a corner). But when I leave early  and say goodbye, everyone asks why I am leaving and tells me to stay. I have a hard time saying no or explaining myself-- especially to crowds. I started saying goodbye to only the host and a few people and then just leaving. But then I feel bad about the irish goodbye.

I’m Dutch and they is a completely new problem for me so I came here to get some alternative options.

I have been trying to help a friend of mine who is in pretty deep and really needs professional help, but he just can’t afford it. I asked if he tried online support groups, he has tried them but they keep telling him: go get help. He wants to but just can’t afford it. 

Me and psychiatrists go waaay back and I have had almost every sort of therapy that exists, but this does not make me a psychiatrist what so ever and thus means I can only give him advice on what works for me. 

What I have come up with so far is:
1. Make a to do list for everyday, with all the basic things like getting up, showering, changing clothes etc.
2. Try to come out of your house and be outside at least 20 minutes a day, this can be walking to the store or just walk somewhere and go people watching 
3. If you’re at work, try to set a daily, and most importantly, realistic goal for yourself so you have a reason to be a little proud of yourself everytime you finish your shift. You probably won’t feel proud the first few times, but you do have a reason to. 
4. (Might be a weird one but it works for me) start your day of by going on Reddit and commenting something nice or supportive on a post of someone who is obviously going through a rough time.

I know I’ve got myself to blame, but dammit I didn’t get help because everything I was told was that I was over imagining, or I was tired, or that my hallucinations were too weak or brief to “qualify”.

She's going through a lot right now and I want to talk to her about my struggles, but I don't feel it's my place, not when she's going through so much and especially because we found out that my older sister was sexually assaulted and was dealing with really bad anxiety and depression and self-harm. 

My partner found a new job pretty soon and we continued shopping for houses. The job he got was salaried and a position in management so it was a very good job. We found a house that we liked and we put an offer in. It was accepted and I started to feel a little bit better, but then he lost his job again. This time it wasn't because he nicked something or because he did something stupid. It was because his manager was going to be losing their assistant store manager and they needed him to pick all the information and work up quicker than they expected. He wasn't performing like they wanted, and because he was still in his probation period they just let him go. This put a lot more strain on us but I didn't blame him because it wasn't his fault. He's got another job.

I work in retail and so does my partner. We worked at the same place. Until he lost his job. You know what it's like at work, nothing stays secret for long and I am someone who cares about what people think of me. Everyone started talking and it really got to me. The day he handed in his resignation (because they let him do that instead of firing him so he wouldn't have a bad record) I didn't go into work. I just couldn't face them. I came back and everyone was asking me how he was and if everything was okay and it was getting to me. My good work friend was telling me how people I thought were my friends were talking about me and my partner behind my back. Eventually it subsided and it wasn't hot gossip anymore. I live in a smallish town and when they found out that he had been let go from his second job the rumours started again. I found out that someone I have known for 4 + years was talking about my partner with a manager saying ""have you heard that _______ has lost his job, he probably lost it from nicking again."" I'm stressing because I'm afraid this label is going to follow my partner around for the rest of his life. This woman that I had known for 4 + years that I thought was my friend has been going around to our local shops and telling them the reason why my partner lost his job in the first place. 

Last year I stopped smoking. It's been about 10 to 11 months now and I'm glad that I did, but I used smoking as a crutch and not just a crutch but also I would smoke when I was bored and I get bored a lot.  Since then instead of smoking I now eat and I have put on about 20 kilos. I've always struggled with my weight and I've always been extremely self-conscious about my weight throughout my life and now it's just even worse. I am 5 ft 5 with change, and last time I checked 92.3 kilos. Most of my fat goes to my stomach and when I stand and look at myself in the mirror naked I hate what I see. So I tried to diet, and I do good. I start to lose weight and then I self sabotage. I don't know why I just do. It doesn't help that me and my partner don't have as much sex as we used to. Sex is just not as important to him as it is to me. None of my old clothes fit. My jeans don't fit. I just wear leggings and T-shirts. I've got a double chin now. It's small, but everytime I look at it I feel disgusted with myself. I just want to be different, but I just don't have the motivation and I know that's an excuse and I try to change it, but it just doesn't happen. I know that's on me though.


These have just been stressor to me, but it's not the worst part. The worst part is my mind. My brain. It calls me nasty things and makes me doubt myself all the time. I get dark thoughts very often. 
Examples: what would happen if I died? Would my family miss me? Would they cry? Image if the car just crashed right now. Imagine if someone drove off the road and drove straight into me. Imagine if someone left a bomb at my place of work and it exploded.
My mind calls me ugly and manipulative, a cry baby, attention seeker. And I believe it. I second guess the way I feel all the time. I always think ""do I actually feel this way or do I just want attention"". This is my fault though because I have done it in the past and now I don't know if my emotions are real or fake because I want attention. No, I know they're real, but I always second guess myself. I'm sad more than I'm happy and I feel like a burden on my partner. He is always there for me. He always hugs me and holds me and comforts me. He can tell when something is wrong without me saying. I feel blessed to have him. And he has me. 

If you ask anyone about me they say that I'm an extrovert, that I'm always smiley and bubbly and happy and lovely. And I can be these things, just not often anymore. Most days I get up and I think to myself great I have to go into work and pretend. I have to put on that mask and act like the happy bubbly person everyone expects me to be. But I just can't do it anymore. recently when I'm at work I have at least 5+ people ask me ""are you ok? You just don't seem like your normal smiley self today."" And I pretend and say yeah I'm fine and each time I have to say that I feel like I'm losing a piece of myself. The other day at work my back was hurting so I took 2 Anadin (painkillers). I waited 20 mins and it hadn't kicked in yet. I knew I should wait longer, but I took 2 more and then fantasized about taking the whole packet. I don't want to die. I just want to hurt myself. I had made a promise to my partner that if I got any dark thoughts or if I thought about wanting to hurt myself that I would let him know. After I had thoughts about taking the painkillers, I felt so ashamed I wasn't going to tell him. But I've never been good at keeping something that's on my mind away from him and I told him and I broke down crying and begged for his forgiveness and said that I'm so sorry and that I don't want die. And he forgave me and held me and comforted me while I cried. 

I have hurt myself before. I'm not someone who could cut myself, so I pinch myself really hard on my shoulders and my thigh's. I get scars that will fade with time. When I have the scars I like seeing them, but if I forget to cover them and my family or my partner see and mention them I get really embarrassed and feel ashamed. My partner knows what they are and I've promised him that I wouldn't do it, but I break that promise sometimes when I feel really bad. My family they don't know what they are and when they see them, I lie and say that I scratch myself really bad in my sleep. That's what they think they are. I don't do it often and I haven't done it recently. Sometimes I choke myself or hold my breath until it hurts. 

I say that I want to be able to talk to my family, but really I dont. I don't feel comfortable talking to any of them, even my best friends. The only person I feel comfortable talking to is my partner because I feel ok being vulnerable around him. Everyone else thinks I'm strong and dependable and I'm the person they come to when they need help and because they think I am that way, I feel like I have to be that way. I feel like I can't show vulnerability or sadness, but lately I haven't been able to keep the mask on. 

I feel so much more panic and anxiousness then I used to. I feel like I'm on the verge of having a minor panic attack often. Something happens and I feel the panic and worry clutch my chest and my breathing feels tight and tingly. Sometimes I get really dizzy and feel like I'm gonna pass out. I've been good at controlling my breathing when that happens, or when I feel like I'm gonna cry. I feel like I get upset or snappy more often then I used to and I feel sorry for my partner.
 
I went to work the other day and I broke down. I told one of the personnel manager's everything. Even that I've hurt myself and then I nearly had a panic attack. She made me ring the doctors office infront of her and book an appointment for that day. Then I went home. I went to the doctors and was signed off work for a week, my partner even called into work and stayed with me even though he had just started a new job. I felt so drained. I had told multiple people about my life and struggles. It felt good but I also felt panic and I still do. That manager at work now knows everything. She knows I hurt myself. And I regret talking her so bad. My partner doesn't because he's says I would have gone home and then went to work the next day and still wouldn't have seen a doctor, which I can get. I went back to the doctor after the week because I wasn't ready to go back to work, and the doctor signed me off until the end of this month, she put me on antidepressants and referred me to go counselling. But I don't want to. I want to get better, but I just don't have the energy or courage to tell more people about my problems. Its a small town, what if it's someone I know or if I see them around. I already feel like I've made myself too vulnerable. But the closer I get to the end of the month and i haven't done anything the more tense and panicky I feel.",15Aug2019,5

101,"I’m a 24 F in the US and I think I have depression and anxiety and social anxiety. I say I think because I’ve been to 2 therapists but neither one has officially diagnosed me. The first one told me it sounds like you’re depressed and that I may have social anxiety and the second one told me I may have anxiety even though I rarely get panic attacks. Both times I had to pay out of pocket $50 per session cause my insurance won’t cover it. I’ve been seeing this lady since March and I’ll walk in and she’ll ask me what’s going on in my life and I’ll tell her about stupid mistakes I’ve made in the past week and she’ll listen and tell me how the things I did weren’t that bad. I mostly do the talking even when I try to talk less so she can help me. One day when I told her that I wanna quit my job so I don’t have to talk to people face to face anymore she said we can try doing role play next time I see her but we didn’t. I thought that therapists are supposed to teach you how to cope with your issues but she hasn’t taught me any coping methods and I don’t think she is teaching me CBT. I don’t know if what coping methods or self care are, I’ve just heard those words online. Anyways All she does is explain to me how my mistakes aren’t that bad and give vague advice about my job or desire to go to community college. I say vague advice because she doesn’t tell me exactly what I should do, which I think would help me more.  She has told me things I haven’t thought about before and I do feel a little better after the session but I’m just as depressed as I was 5 months ago. Last month I asked her if I should be on medication and she asked on a scale of 1-10 how bad is my depression. I said 8 or 9 because I cannot imagine being happy in the future, I think I’ll be anxious and stressed everyday. I don’t want to kill myself but I wish I’d get hit by a car or die in an accident because everyday is full of suffering for me and the little moments of happiness I get aren’t quite worth it. Anyways I said something along those lines and she said “If your depression is as bad as you say it is Then I think you can benefit from medication.” Why would she say if it’s as bad as I say it is. Did she think my depression will just go away by talking about it? How do I say what you’ve been doing for me so far hasn’t worked at all and I want to you to try to teach me CBT or coping skills without being rude? Or do I have a problem with my expectations being too high? Is it that all therapists need to do is talk to you and you have to do the homework to make yourself not want to die? Will therapists will only talk to me and I have to learn to make major changes to my thinking on my own?  


TLDR:  I thought that therapists are supposed to teach you how to cope with your issues but mine hasn’t taught me any coping methods or self care or CBT. All she does is explain to me how my mistakes aren’t that bad and give vague advice. She is insightful and I do feel a little better after the session but I’m just as depressed as I was 5 months ago. How do I tell her she hasn’t been helping me? Or are my expectations too high and all therapists need to do is talk to you and you have to do the homework to learn CBT and self care and make yourself not want to die?",15Aug2019,1

106,"I used to take an escitalopram for my anxiety for a year. I stopped taking it few months ago. I wanted to get back to it, but I had to go to a different hospital. 

I told the doctor that that escitalopram was great, no side effects, took it for a year. I just stopped taking it because I thought I was better. He then asked about other medicines I took, I told him I don't remember their name, besides xanax, but they didn't work. 

The doctor then perscribed me 3 different pills. He didn't even say anything about the pills, no advice on anything at all.  Only when I asked why didn't he perscribed me that escilatopram, he said this does the same thing, just more modern. (I didn't ask ok, that's one of them then, what's the other two.) 

When he said it's the same thing I took it to mean its an escitalopram but just a different brand name. Nope. None of these is even an SSRI. 

I'm too scared to take these pills now because I only had bad experiences with other kinds of anxiety medicine. 

I'm wondering his phrasing about the 'it's just more modern' thing. Was it reasonable for me to think that it would be the same kind of SSRI, or at least an SSRI? The more I think about it the more I think I just severerly misunderstood and he had the right to say it's just more modern. I don't know what to do. I don't wanna take these.  Would it be reasonable for me to go back and ask for the specific medication I want because I'm too afraid to take these and I misunderstood what he meant?",15Aug2019,1

The really weird thing is, I've been getting fears i've never had before.  


I fear drinking water, that's fucking right.  
I can force myself to drink it, but it gives me horrible panic attacks and the worst part is i've already seen a doctor and he's already explained to me that 1. There's no water in my lungs. 2. Chances are I won't have any kind of aspiriation problems until i'm much older.  


But I STILL fear it, it's getting very fustrating because the doctor wants me to start taking a generic version of pram (Can't remember the full medicines name.) But I honestly don't think it'll help, i don't know how to combat this.  


There's no support groups for fighting a mental illness that wants you to be miserable, it feels like my brain is reaching for shit to hang onto to make me hate my life, i can't cook my own food because I don't trust dish soap, I can hardly drink water because I constnatly feel like it might go into my lungs.

110,"Hello!

How many of you have experienced significant weight gain while on antidepressants? 

This is my current medication: 

* Sertralin ( I take it in the morning)  (SSRI, active substance sertraline so same as Zoloft) 
* Ketipinor depot (I take it at around 6-8pm) (antipsychotic, quietiapine, an equivalent to Seroquel Prolong)
* Ketipinor (around 9pm) (equivalent to Seroquel)

Quietiapine seems to work very well for me apart from, of course, the weight gain.  I've tried probably 15 different antidepressants during the last ten years. Quietiapine has been the best so far. But it does increase my appetite. My appetite for carbs (sugars) in particular. I'm always thinking about food. Trying to eat a reasonable amount and only 4-5 times a day. Most days are not succesful. A lot of the times I feel like I have no control over my actions regarding food/eating.

116,"hello, I am a 17 year old high school student.

To be honest, I have no idea why I am posting this, but I have never felt so bad as now. I have the feeling that I'm completely  lost in life and everything is going wrong and I'm at the point of just collapsing.

I never really had any friends because I shut everyone out of my personal life (I guess this is because I was bullied a lot during my childhood). Because of this I spent my days playing games and watching movies which results in that I am socially incapable and can't really connect with other people. around two years ago my home situation changed because my sister got mentally ill and required all the attention from my parents and family, so I started to reject all my family members and solved all my problems on my own. For this I was angry for a long time at her, but not long ago I realised it wasn't her fault and I tried to reconnect with her and apologized. All of this gave me the reputation of an a\*\*hole at school and in my family which I really don't want to be.

This year, I also made my first ever friend from the opposite sex. of course everything had to get worse again and I started getting feelings for her (I'm actually not even sure those were real 'love' feelings). But it became clear that she is not interested in me (probably a good thing I guess). My grades also dropped hard and I barely made it trough this year by asking all my teachers for extra exercises and explanation.

Then I finally received some good news, I got to work as a student somewhere but I had to get up really early (4am) which messed up my sleeping routine, if it wasn't already due to the long gaming nights.

Al these things brought me where I am right now, A social incapable introvert who is afraid of talking to even his family members and does nothing with his life except wasting it inside. and the only thing I want is just to have some persons to sometimes talk to, or who I can help with something (I like helping other people, idk why).

118,"So I'm 19, Male, 2nd of 8 kids, and in a loving family. Some of us have issues, but nothing not to be expected when there are 10 of us.

So I've always been a model child. Of sorts. I suck at school, but make up for it with people skills. I've used that gift to make it through high school, which I almost gave up on sinior year cuz I was just so done I didn't care anymore.

Anyway fast forward a year later, and im working part-time to full-time at a local grocery store chain, and working YT editing on the side when I get home. But my mental health has been getting worse and worse.

I have depression, cutting, anxiety, and more recently panic attacks. I sometimes sleep 9-11 hours for a week, then the next sleep for 2-4 hours a night. I can't stay in the same mindset, and I'm stumbling over words and get frustrated really fast. Usually I'm considered calm and polite, and engaging.

So I had a panic attack when I got to work, and freaking out I felt I had to get out of there asap. So I left. And then when I chilled out I realized how bad of an idea that was, and went back. (The next day, I left near the end of a shift.) Understandably I was fired, and I did not tell them about my mental health issues.

That was yesterday. Last night I put on makeup, emo style, cuz I enjoy the process. The precision for the eyeliner, and exactness of the lipstick, and how it all fits together so well. Anyways, I came home today after ""going to work"" (rly just sitting job applications) and my mom noticed the eyeliner. I tried to play it off as a marker smudge, but she wasn't having that. 

In my family dude to religion (that I believe in too,) you should not be gay. If you are gay, fine. No reason to impose our religion upon you, that'd be a jerk move. But for us, we can't/shouldn't be. I already am a guy that gets along well with kids and is comfortable in his own style, but am sometimes mistaken for gay. My mom's fear is that I'll become gay.

Anyway, so she's prob gunna tell my dad, who's more strict than she is. And then he'll be mad that I'm ""using him"" (cuz I still live at home, he understandably wants me to be working hard.)

Long story short I use makeup to give my mind something to think about instead of killing myself or cutting. And I can't say that or they'll get to all worried and life will suck way more. I have ppl I confide in, and my family are not those people. I don't want to say how much money I have in the bank, it's my money. BUT if I say any of this then I'll either have to move out, or pay for food, rent, etc. Either way I'll have to work more hours at a minimum wage job I hate while hoping I don't get a panic attack or get depressed enough to try and kill myself. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live like this. I have a passion and my family hates it. (YT editing.) I work hard at it and my dad assumes the worst.

120,"So, I'm a disabled, autistic trans girl with agoraphobia and can barely step outside my door without having a panic attack. We moved to a new state a few years ago and as a result i have not had an IRL friend in 3+ years and have been single for the same amount of time. Going outside is impossible. To top it off I suffer from intense dysphoria, and i live with a terrible family that makes me the but of jokes, uses me as a scapegoat whenever something goes wrong, take 80% of my disability money in rent, and refuse to wash my clothing unless i sweep perfectly for them (they refuse to let me use their washer and dryer myself cause they're power hungry)  


soo im on twitter and discord alot obviously, and it seems everyone is advancing but me. Everyone's progressing in their lives but I remain stagnant. One friend if having facial feminization surgery, another is having bottom surgery to have a vagina installed, another is moving out of their parents house in with their BF, another friend lives a perfecet life with their partners on a farm with plenty of money to go by. 3 Other friends RN are visiting eachother in europe, probably having a 3some knowing them, while I remain a virgin at my age cause I can't go outside.  


I feel intense jealousy and a sting in my heart every time one of my friends advances or posts a selfie of themselves with someone they care about, because I know I'll never have any of these things. I'll always be disabled, always be all alone, always be stuck in this house with abusive family, never have a partner, never make IRL friends.  I just want to feel like a real adult, I want to do very basic things other adults do like, you know, HAVE FRIENDS, and go outside, drive a car, have my own apartment, have a relationship.   


But instead I can't leave my house, so I lay on the floor in front of my laptop all day daydreaming about doing violent terrible things to myself as my parents yell at me for the pettiest of things. Then of course I have to deal with the lack of privacy....mom recently bought a camera to spy on me when they are gone, and they dont knock on my door when they want to come in to get their clothes (they keep THEIR CLOTHES and THEIR POSSESSIONS in MY CLOSET)

122,"I have no idea the route I should be taking right now. I have been with my significant other for over 10 years now since we were teenagers and I have always noticed that his younger brother seemed slightly off with daily activities and especially social situations. I have kindly brought this up to my fiancé several times to see if he was on the same page as me. He’s told me that he’s always noticed these things in his brother as well.. so I had brought up to him if he had ever brought this up to his parents to see if they felt the same way. The problem is his parents are very prideful and do not find anything wrong in his behavior or his activities at all. His parents do notice that with as much as he talks and doesn’t stop for literally 30 mins straight, coming up with random facts or talking about his past like he’s experienced so much.. when in fact he is only 12. I have noticed that both of his parents get easily annoyed when he continues to babble on about all of these random things that do not matter in every day life and they tell him to just be quiet and relax because of the rate and volume that he starts talking in. The past couple years in school he has done extremely bad. He has barely been passing for an elementary school student. I have no idea how any of the school officials have not contacted his parents or have had raise their eyebrows thinking that this situation of him feeling could be bigger than just not studying. They have never made any phone calls to his parents letting them know that he has been failing. His parents always end up finding out at the end of the year, and have to practically push summer school on him or cram different projects down his throat at the very last month just to get him to pass on to the next grade. of course there is so much more to the story that has to do with his behavior and small texts and actions that I have personally noticed being that I have been his babysitter all summer long and that I have been his babysitter for weeks at a time before hand. But my ultimate question is, is there anything that I can personally do being a person that does not have any custody or any say in his life? 
I feel like calling the school and somehow requesting them to counsel him and to figure out what is going on in his mind or if there is any type of testing that they can do to pick out whatever they need to to diagnose him. I definitely feel like there is no way that he is completely mentally stable and that scares me because I’m about to have his first nephews or nieces and I want to make sure that I can trust that he will behave appropriately around them as they will be newborns. 
I do not want him to grow up the rest of his teenage years feeling lost or not understanding why he’s behaving much more different than the other kids because at this stage he’s going to start to get all of these hormones that is going to change him. I want him to live a normal teenage life and if that means that he needs to be on some sort of medication to do so I would like to be the person to make that happen so he does not become depressed like so many kids are these days. I feel like I am literally the only person that cares enough and wants to reach out to To somebody and put this on the table and get him help but I also want to remain as disguised as possible. I didn’t want to offend any of his family and especially his parents because they have been so kind to me. But he needs help in the end and I feel like I need to absolutely do something to help at least start the process. How can I go about this? Please help.",15Aug2019,1

130,"I'll call my friend jess and my sister Emily for privacy 

so my mum and jess's mum knew each other before they gave birth to any of us, so we knew each other from the start of our lives. Emily is 2 years older than me and Jess is 1 year older than me, so we are all around the same age. we were born in Australia but quickly moved to India. when I was about 3 or 4 I remember i never felt like I was part of their club, like we all agreed on getting a barbie each but when I got mine they changed last minute and go 2 dog teddies. I always felt left out from that because when we would play together I couldn't join in because I didn't have the same toy. writing that out sounds kinda stupid but it's just the first part. 
a few years later we moved to the UK. this is when things got really bad, I remember they would tell me they wanted to play hide and seek and they told me to count (I'd always have to count) and we agreed to only hide inside the house but they always went outside so I could never find them. we were about 6 or 7 here. they would also gossip about me and make things up about me. they would have inside jokes that I could never be a part of. when we were about 8 or 9 we would have sleep overs. something that happened a lot was Emily lying to me saying there wasn't going to be a sleep over but then going over to jess's house without me. o guess they just didn't want me around. I told my mum and she didn't really care because it was foe us to sort out or some bullshit (it might be good to add that my mother has never had my back over anything) . when I did actually see Jess with Emily, whenever I went to the bathroom or got a drink or something they would hide from me or go on a walk and talk shit about me. 
when I turned 10 they admitted that they were always horrible to me, and that they did bully me for years. everything was moderately fine for years now (I am 16 now) but I have always noticed something, it may sound petty but when ever we walk on the pavement or just a more narrow part of ground they always walk together and I'm always left at the back. so I can never join in on the conversation because I can't hear what they are saying. I feel like they just don't like me.

I tried to talk to my mum a couple days ago about how I feel they don't want me around but I just got shouted at so I can't talk to her about it.

Every time I close my eyes my mind is filled with images of terrifying ghosts and demons and horror scenarios. Like I vividly saw a random bald guy with a huge mouth just start laughing over and over in my head.

134,"To give some info,

I have had help from psychiatric services for a long time, infact off and on 9 years, I'm 22 now. I was diagnosed as a child with oppositional defiance disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder that developed into delusions as I got older and would not have treatment for because I was so unwell I didn't believe I should have it. I was just scraping along being able to cope as a person, I did have a job for a few years, but life stresses would eventually make my existing illness more severe and get out of hand.

For some reason I found my job particularly harder to deal with, my manager was not helpful and was probably picking on me, I couldn't perform because I had untreated ADHD (this was diagnosed down the road) and panic attacks that was beginning to impact the relationship I had with my girlfriend, she couldn't cope, we split up and I was severely depressed. I started to take opioids and hypnotics to cope, I wasn't sleeping and became quite Ill, I started spending time in and out of mental hospitals but it didn't really get to the root of the complications.

At some point when I wasn't using drugs my doctor tried me on a small dose of Flupentixol for anxiety and agitated situations. I only took it a hand full of times I never wanted it. For some reason I started feeling different. I wasn't going hard on drugs here in fact I don't recall taking anything around this period. But I remember I was not able to get any rest. I was off work. I couldn't fall sleep, like I just didn't feel tired. This went on for a few days, and I actually had more alertness then ever. I started feeling very happy, and was just going jogging instead of sleep. When I listened to songs I have heard already they sounded amazing, I could feel the tunes running in my blood, I could hear all sorts of ways the song was made that I had never realised before. I also felt really good about how I looked, I spent hundreds of points on things I didn't need and clothes and stuff, I was speaking very quick and my consultant thought I was high because my eyes was very dilated but I wasn't. He doubled my meds but I didn't use them, I liked it so much. I have not taken anything that would compare to this. Eventually after about two weeks or more or less I really not sure now, I crashed. I remember it aswrll, it was an afternoon I didn't want to speak to anybody like I did, I started feeling exhausted, and music was shit. 

I don't know if I have had any mood swings like this recently, if I have they have been short lived happyness and a lot more irritating, I get more annoyed and pissed off when I'm 'high' than happy. So its not great.

I was told I had ADHD, GAD, OCD, ODD about three weeks ago, and have been put on loads of pills, but my doctor wants to look at what happens that period I was so elevated and see if she can prevent any periods of it again.

I don't really know why I'm talking about this, but that experience was so incredible, I have never felt so in touch before in my life, to anyone with bipolar you know what I mean.

138,"I’ve always been aware of anxiety, depression etc, I have family that suffer from it, friends that suffer from it, hell ....it seems nearly everyone in the world has some form of it or other at this point. 

I’ve never been one for putting labels on things I guess...for me if I ever felt sad or down I just chalked it up to a bad day and tried to move on. Lately I’ve been feeling more down than up and just feel generally lethargic, no particular reason for it but again, to me I thought anxiety or depression was an extreme, crushing feeling which I guess I never felt so never thought I had it. 

I’ve come to realise however that there are different forms of anxiety and depression...it’s not always the extreme of feeling completely broken and not being able to get out of the bed....it can be on a smaller scale but equally crippling....

I’m starting to feel like maybe this feeling I’ve been having lately is more than just general sadness and I’m brushing it off when I should be focusing on it

I constantly worry what I say may upset someone even if it’s something that person might not even have noticed ...for example when I go out for a meal with my family, I’ll be on my way home and realise I never told my mum I loved her and didn’t give her a hug when we left, I then feel immense guilt and feel like a terrible daughter and the guilt I feel makes me imagine her being upset and wondering why I didn’t say goodbye properly ......but in reality she probably didn’t give it a second thought 

I Make myself down and jealous when my mum invites my sister to do something but not me or they seem to be getting a long and having fun and I don’t feel included.....I feel an overwhelming amount of jealousy at this and it’s  not their fault...I just don’t feel good enough. It’s just been a back of my mind thing so I never paid it much attention until recently when it’s been eating me up more....

I’m just realising I have an over heightened sense of emotion when it comes to certain things....for example animals, I’ve never liked movies where something bad happens to an animal... not even it being killed in the movie...it could be that someone kicked a cat and I will feel a massive amount of dread and guilt for what happened to the animal even though I know it’s not real or I didn’t do it. I cry so easily when it comes to anything to do with animals not being taken care of etc .....

I’m writing this all down and it sounds so trivial to me like I feel stupid for even writing this....to me depression is crippling...depression and anxiety are things that shouldn’t be downplayed or used as an excuse.....my problems or even irrational worries or feelings to me feel silly...I would never have classed it as depression or anxiety...i mean there are people really suffering in the world and I’m complaining about being sad ?

# Story

\-This is lifted from a comment I added to another thread, but I think it's important so I'd like to share my thoughts openly.

I found myself up close and personal with a suicide back in the winter. My upstairs neighbour jumped from his 17th floor apartment balcony onto the communal patio of our condo building. I was the last one to see him alive and the first one to find him dead in the morning when I went to our building's gym, which looks-out onto the patio. I was up late writing an essay the previous evening and he was blasting a war movie through his surround sound that was erupting through my ceiling. I went upstairs to his apartment and asked him to keep it down, and I wasn't very nice about it. Not overly rude or swearing, just very assertive. In hindsight, that war movie was him mentally preparing himself to go through with the act.

Anyway, he probably flew by my window a couple of hours later and I didn't even notice, although I do recall hearing a thud and thinking nothing of it. Then, the next morning I ventured downstairs to go for a run at about 10am. Multiple people use that gym from 5:30am onward, yet I was the one that ended up calling in his death 4.5 hours later. Bits and pieces of him ended up on somebody's apartment window metres away from where he fell. I have a bit of a fucking issue with how self-absorbed we're all becoming as it is, so the most traumatic part about it for me is that multiple people probably saw his body lying there and just decided to fuck off on their merry  way to work instead of calling 9/11. That, and of course, my disgruntled face and noise complaint likely being the last human exchange he ever had.

Until I found out the full story of what he had been going through, I literally thought I'd just been kind of a dick to a really depressed dude, and asking him to be quiet was the final straw that prompted him to exit a world he had undoubtedly been experiencing as cruel for some time.  Anyway, I was a mess but I followed my instinct not to keep it to myself. I disclosed it to everyone I know repeatedly and discussed the details until I didn't feel the need to talk about it anymore.  I also ended up writing a university expository essay on suicide and dedicating it to my neighbour, which I found highly cathartic.

Moving on from trauma is all about **processing**, and processing these things takes time and a lot of dialogue. Processing and acceptance times may vary and depend on many factors, such as the amount of time one knows a person. But with the amount of disclosure I engaged in, I was able to process the events in a little over a week and move on with my life. I didn't know him very well, we'd only chatted a few times. Had I known him for 15 years, I'd obviously be working through the effects of the events for a lot longer.

If something of this nature is eating you right now, please, heed my advice and sit with your hurt. You'll fair better in the long run. For anyone wondering what to do when someone they know is in this situation, be there for them. And mainly just listen, unless you're experienced. We're talking head nods, brief verbal prompts, and short questions about their experience to keep them talking.  


**TLDR: Depending on their severity, IMHO/experience, talking about traumatic events as much as possible until you no longer feel the need to is the best way to process them and continue on.**",15Aug2019,2
141,"For some background information I'm 14F with a relatively stable mental health. I'm quite extroverted despite suffering from bullying and low self worth a few years ago. lm not really anxious although I can get flustered easily. I don't see a counsellor/therapist because my family thinks it will go away after a while (it's been 2 years) and I haven't told any of my close friends as I struggle to talk about my feelings and I'm worried they'll think I'm mad or making it up for attention. I'm not suicidal but a year and a half ago I used to wonder if anybody would miss me if I disappeared.

Although I have problems with delusions and paranoia. These started from wondering if any of my friends actually wanted me around and if people are talking behind my back but then dissapeared and changed to more unrealistic ones like worrying if someone is spying on me through my phone camera or knows something about me that I don't and then to panicking if someone is reading my thoughts. It doesn't affect my life as badly as anxiety and depression does to others but it's just a shadow at the back of my mind, but on extremely bad days it can slightly affect my eating and sleeping habits. I'm slowly getting better but some days I wonder if I'm slowly losing my mind

When somebody who isn't a close friend starts a conversation with me I get instantly suspicious and question their intentions, this is partially because I've had manipulative friends in the past. It's hard to explain but I listen out for a certain tone in people's voices to make sure they aren't messing with me. I also have a fear of forming close bonds with friends in case they have been messing with me all along

My paranoia plagues me almost every day and due this I change my phone pin a lot and now my pin is 10+ numbers long. I also fear being tracked down on Reddit by people at school so I delete my accounts. I'm on my 3rd account around a month and a half since I've downloaded reddit.

147,"When I was in high school, this guy, Matt, used me. I met him summer after his senior year was over. I hung out with one of his senior friends Peter. Peter invited me to a party with Tom. I had five shots of vodka. At the party, I didn't know anyone. They asked me to leave to have sex. I was dumb and said yes, because I was drunk. Matt and Peter had sex with me, I bled. I was a sophomore 16 at the time.



Afterward, they ignored me and talked badly about me calling me gross and a slut. They heard rumors about me, so they thought I wanted it. I kept hooking up with Matt because I felt so alone and disgusting maybe if he liked me nothing terrible happened. He left for the military. I have kept an on and off sexting relationship for six years.



From when I was 16-18, I would see him when he was on leave and hookup. He took photos of me two times. He keeps those sending them to me being like ”don't you miss this :)” He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me.




I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more. That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. .
He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me. 



I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me. I haven't seen him in person for four years. I blew up at him.



He was trying to bait me by apologizing then he would come on to me. He had a life in girlfriend at the time I blew up at him calling him a waste of space, rapist, douchebag, cockroach and a sociopath. I'm not proud because over the years 



I've never said anything that means to him.
He acts like he has the moral high ground and I'm a bitch because he had never said anything so mean to me (even though he called me annoying when I was asking why I wasn't good enough when I found out he had a girlfriend and used me).


He also says he didn't rape me that we were all having fun and meant no harm. He says he didn't force or manipulate me(I did say yes right away), he was drunk too, and it's only a two year age difference.


Am I a mean person for sending all these mean messages? What's wrong with me? Why did he treat me this way? Was that sexual assault?

Well this is the thing, i (M 23) met E (F 23), she have been the most intense relationship i've been so far, in so many levels, but since the beggining we've having a lot of problems, all because of me and my insecurities. things like im being jelaus with her, and she have been the most trustful person in my life, but i still feel very insecure about her going places with people, like no matter what the worst case scenario just stays there and i feel axious, i try not to act anxious like overtexting her, but still in my interactions, you can feel the insecurity.

i been trying self parenting methods, i've been trying isolating myself from things that put me on that insecure state, to look to the core of the problem and see if there lays the solution, im changing my enviroment, my workplace, my friends,  but nothing so far works fast enough or deep enough, its like, a short fix instead of a deep beneficial change.

and thats the other thing, everytime we have a problem i manage to understand the problem and formulate a solution, then i do the solution but, nothing really changes, and im not talking about her anymore, i feel like i dont change, like my insecurities doesnt leave, like my lack of empathy at the moment of thinking my actions doesnt change, im trying hard to stop being a child and start being a man for the benefit of my own life and the ones who cares about me but i dont find the way of doing it",15Aug2019,1
150,"I’ve suffered on and off with mental health issues for the last 11 years, but was always convinced I could handle them. I distracted myself by joining clubs and keeping busy. When I got older I joined the gym and lifted my way out of a depression. It’s been really bad for the last year, and as always I’ve tried to get my way through it alone. I ended up quitting my job and moving to another city in the hopes that it was just my situation making me depressed this time. All that did was make things worse, as I now realise the situation wasn’t bad except now I’m nowhere near my friends and no longer have the life I’d built myself.

Tonight was a low point. I have suicidal thoughts often, but tonight was the closest I’ve ever been to it. It was hours of ‘just survive the next 5 minutes’ until I was off the ledge so to speak. I now know If I don’t do something about this, it’s going to ruin my life; if it doesn’t kill me.

I’m going to phone my GP tomorrow and get an appointment. What should I expect in the UK? Anyone have their experience they could share?",15Aug2019,7
151,"I don't mean feeling squimish in the stomach I mean extreme issues with my skin. And this isn't just my own body's fault. Last relationship I was in I constantly had health issues, i got insanely sunburnt on my shins while out kayaking and ended up with massive blisters from my ankle up to my knee caps on both legs that I still have scars from, then I copped splitting cracks on my feet that were bleeding.. cracked lips aswell. Anyway I guess it all comes down to bad luck. 

Last weekend I met a guy while out at a pub, we never hooked up but we got each other's details, I kind of fobbed it off because he's only 18 and I'm 30 with kids and just assumed he wasn't interested, anyway he messaged me yesterday and we were chatting all day through text. Today I wake up with this poxy rash all around my mouth and up the side of my cheek. 

Sometimes I look down the rabbit hole and think is there something out there that is telling me I shouldn't be in a relationship? Is it my mind playing games with me to trick me into not looking after my self properly? Am i putting all my inner energy into being excited about this person? Or is it just random shit all happening at once. I do understand being Bipolar your mind can escape you at times and make something out of nothing that really isn't reality but this is just one of those trippy things I tend to experience when when I'm excited about someone sexually and personally. 

I guess what I'm saying is i feel like my intuition tries to punish me at times, tries to contain me. And then I go on to think that this intuition isn't really my intuition, it's that dark thing inside wearing a mask trying to trick me into being miserable.",15Aug2019,2
152,"The title says it all. I'm pretty certain I'm sociopathic. I've done quite a bit of research (only online to be fair) and I match almost all tendencies and traits as a sociopath would. 

To summarize:

I lie consistently and without reason. Sometimes it is just to make someone laugh, feel bad, sad, or make myself look cooler. 

I am able to read and manipulate people with ease, and do so regularly. Sometimes it is for my financial gain, social status, or even at times, just for fun. This means that much of my charm (I am quite good looking) is completely false and purposefully performed. Sometimes I will purposefully make someone feel loved, or purposely retract this affection in order to maintain control over them and the situation. 

I am very emotional and have strong tendencies and urges to perform random acts; stealing, engaging in meaningless sex, masturbation, and substance abuse (though none of this has severely affected my life so far). 

I am extremely lazy and often very undisciplined towards myself; I can spend a whole day in my bed watching movies. Yet I always get by and excel in school, with very little to no effort (I am going to a top 25 global university and studying business there). 

The only things that stand apart from me and a stereotypical sociopath is that I can, and often do feel empathy. Animals, babies, and generally innocent people invoke real and serious empathy from me. On the other hand, I feel as though I could just as easily wreck someone's life or have someone murdered for my personal gain and feel nothing. 

I have only a few meaningful relationships in my life; two or three best friends, my mother, and my ex-girlfriend (though at times I feel I only loved her for the sex). 

I also have no violent tendencies, and in fact, hate death and am very squeamish. 

In conclusion, am I a sociopath? I am acutely aware that there is something distinctly wrong with my brain, but is this me being a sociopath? I have pretty severe ADD so could that be it? Is there anything that can be done about this? Again, I do not have any violent tendencies, but these traits do scare me into thinking that I will never have a normal life, family, or friends in the future.

153,"When I was around 7 - 8 my family took me to a special doctor as they called it. I now know it was a therapist that I went to. 

But I found out recently that it was my primary school  that forced me to go! 
They were so convinced that something was wrong with me that they kept sending me there.  Which wasn’t the best experience for a 8 year old who didn’t understand what was happening. So I answered all the guys questions and drew the things he asked and did the tasks he asked.

I found out that the tests I did were to see if I was a psychopath.  Because instead of presuming I was bullied by most people they just thought that because I had no friends it was my fault and that I couldn’t feel any emotions. They thought that I was dangerous and should be medicated age 8! 

They kept testing me for things like brain damage and all sorts. The therapist concluded that I don’t have anything wrong with me except my very short attention span and hyperactivity (I have adhd the doctors were meant to give me a fidget toy but never did , it’s a struggle but that’s a different story)

I’m sorry this is long but it just hurts because my mother agreed with my school. My dad thought it was ridiculous and argued but my mum thought the same thing they did.

I’m older now but still in school and there are things actually wrong but now because of what happened I’m scared to talk to my mother because she’s so convinced that somethings wrong..",15Aug2019,1

Based on the possible symptoms do guys think I should visit a shrink or a psychologist.",15Aug2019,1
155,"I just need to get this out. It's OK if you don't have anything to say in return. 

I can't even defend myself or do what's right for my family anymore. I know why I'm like this, I'm just having a hard time getting around it.

When someone tries to take advantage of me I look for ways to fight back, but then the empathy and doubt kicks in. The longer I've known the person the stronger it is. Eventually I end up shrinking back into my mental hole and doing nothing.

If what I want to do feels even remotely selfish I just can't do it. I went through so much abuse for so many years, and the one thing they all had in common was they were some of the most self-centered people I've ever encountered. I can't stand the thought of being like them, even just a bit. So I end up letting people walk all over me.

Because I have a warped sense of what's selfish I can't follow through even when I know I have every right to. If my actions would impact someone else's life in the slightest it feels selfish. And that's where the guilt kicks in. I start feeling like crap just for considering doing it because in my mind it makes me just as bad as the people that hurt me so badly.

And then there's the problems with my self-esteem. It's not surprising that I feel like I don't deserve anything good in my life. But even though I recognize it for what it is I can't get those old voices out of my head. I'm always wondering if they were right. I've lived up to their predictions so far, but I can't tell if it's their fault or mine. And blaming it all on them feels selfish, too. It seems like a cop-out.

The only thing that overrides all this is anger, but because my emotions are so damn unstable I can't rely on it. The indignation never lasts long enough to get me through it. So far, I haven't found anything else that helps.

Yet again, I find myself in this situation. The indecision alone is causing me a great deal of stress. It's doing a real number on my physical health, and mentally I've never been worse. 

This new adversary has done more damage to my mental health than many of my past abusers did. I have nothing to do with their personal affairs, but when they massively screwed up their life they shifted the emotional fallout and blame onto me.

I don't deserve this. All I really want in life is a little peace and stability. I've earned it. I wish people would just leave me the hell alone, but they never do. 

And people wonder why people like me want to die. It's because we just don't have the energy to keep the opportunistic bastards at bay anymore. It's not because death is appealing, it's because it's better than what we're already dealing with. It took making a promise to someone that I love more than life itself to convince me to stick around. I would die for them, but they want it the other way around.

And so I suffer in silence, for them and no one else. I don't make promises unless I know without a doubt that I can keep it, but sometimes I regret taking that deal. I'm just so tired. I don't have a whole lot of fight left in me.

I hope I can follow through this time. I don't know how, but maybe the sense of betrayal will be enough. My recent foe really hurt me. I used to have a lot of respect for them. I showed them deference, then they stabbed me in the back.

The law is on my side, but it was on my side in the past, too. You'd think that'd be enough to convince my stupid brain that I'm in the right here.

All I ask for is that you wish me luck. I'm really gonna need it.",15Aug2019,1

I have managed to pass exams before with way less effort but since my eyes got worse I struggle a lot with studying I have this constant pain in my head and eyes  and it is really hard for me to focus.

I have been dealing with depression for a little over a year now and I am done living my life thinking that nobody cares. At first, I thought it would just go away, but it never did, and by the time I realized what was happening, i was already telling myself nobody would care, and nobody would notice you gone, so when I wanted help, I was too scared to ask the people that I trusted. So when I’m given the opportunity to open up, I shy away from it and just act happy and like everything is fine, even with the person I love and trust the most.

Last year, we had gotten in trouble and her parents didn’t take it well, so they friend to separate us. They told her to stop talking to me so she did, and now that school has started again, we can only talk in person. But I’m at too scared to tell her face to face. Her parents threatened to move schools if she talked to me and her parents might actually follow out on their word. But she is the only one I want to know what is going on, even if she can’t get me the help I need, I feel like telling her is my best option.

I'm on sertraline, propranolol, promethazine and olanzapine.

I cant seem to find any other way of coping other than cutting my arm (which has got to the point where its requiring stitches each time). I really do just hate myself, I feel lost and there is no future for me anymore. 
Its been going on for 4 years but only in the last year it gotten to the point where I cant battle this anymore. To make things worse when I went down hill a year ago, long term friends decided to ditch me and didnt want to deal with me. I then made some online friends who have helped me a fuck tone. But with what happened I've become paranoid about my new friends not liking me and feeling like a burden. In the past it got so bad that I ended up just asking them and they said I wasnt. But recently they've been ghosting my texts etc and I have even mentioned briefly that I was shit to be around but they responded to that saying that I wasnt (that was a couple of days ago).
The thing is I full understand that I'm hard to deal with in the state I'm currently in. But it just feeds my anxiety when they do ghost me for a bit and feeds that original thought of friends not liking me (fyi I do know its 100% factual that they are ghosting me and it's not just my mind fucking with me). I end up physically vomiting over it and idk what to do. I just wish that if they did have a problem with me that they just would say it. Rather than saying everything is fine and then a day later just ghosting me for the next couple of days. I just cant cope with this and feel like just shutting myself off from everyone.

167,"A month ago I had a huge anxiety attack and since then I’ve felt like I’m part of an alternative universe. Derealization has been horrible the past two weeks, I’ve looked into the philosophy of solipsism and it basically destroyed my mind. For the past two weeks I’ve accepted that the only thing real in this world is my mind and everything and everyone else is part of the simulation. I’m a 19 year old who just completed his first year of college, and I feel as if whatever I do in life I won’t be happy. No car, no job, and I have a few close friends but they’re people I can’t really open up to. I also had two girlfriends over the course of high school, one was pretty serious, but over the past year or so I’ve barely talked to anyone of the opposite sex AT ALL besides my own mother and sister. I feel increasingly awkward, increasingly hopeless, etc. I feel as if there’s no point to life. The derealization has made me feel less anxious about everyones inevitable death, and yesterday was the first time in my life I felt as if I’d rather just be dead.

Today I woke up and decided to I was going to get another vaping device (yup, roast me) because the past two weeks have been no way to live my life. I kicked the habit months ago but with this past month I’ve finally decided I need SOMETHING to make things feel better (I don’t drink, which unfortunately is the only thing people my age seem to all enjoy.) After vaping I felt as if the derealization I had been experiencing immediately improved (I felt more “real”), and I felt honestly excited for my future and what it holds. A few hours later I still feel “real”, but still a bit depressed and awkward.

I am unable to find any information, similar to mg experience. (Mostly because I dont know how to form it into a google search).

The first experience occured when I was 5 years old and really sick(fever, vomiting etc).

Experience itself was something like lucid dream + vertigo(with out nausea) + paranoia + ""faintly loud"" noise(like audio sensory overload) I remember my eyes were closed, but I could see/feel the presence of a HUGE (infinite) room being over me. And the feeling of an infinite room was making me to feel scared in my mind. The infinite room felt, how I would imagine floating in space would feel like.

The second experience(as 20 years old) started right before falling asleep. Experience itself felt exactly the same, and it instantly brought up the memory of the first experience. Weirdly the ""infinite room paranoia"" didn't feel as scary and I tried to feel what exactly is happening to me. Thanks to feeling it, I am able to write it down now. Before the second experience, I had been tring to think a few times about the first one, over the 15 years... and it always was a mystery to me, what I had felt.

I’m stuck here as my husband is Canadian &amp; getting him the appropriate visa so we can live in Australia is quite difficult.

My job frustrates me as I feel I’m doing my part but other people just dump shit on me because they don’t want to do it &amp; i’m admin, so clearly I’m there to support everyone else. I do my job &amp; have to rely on people to make decisions based off the information I give them. Most of the time they just ignore what I tell them so I don’t understand what the point of me evening saying anything is.

I’m currently trying to dig myself out of debt &amp; have been slowly trying to do this for 3 years now. In that time I haven’t bought anything for myself that was absolutely needed for survival. My birthday &amp; Christmas money have either gone to paying bills or paying off debt. I feel bad buying food even, it feels like I’m wasting my money even if I need the nutrients. I don’t celebrate stuff like Christmas, Easter, birthdays or anniversaries because we don’t have money to do that &amp; also why bother?

I don’t have any hobbies. My life consists of work, food, movies, tv shows &amp; video games. I don’t have money or equipment to pursue things that might interest me. I spend a lot of time sleeping because I have nothing else to do &amp; have been known to sleep for 10 or so hours on weekends.

Most of the time it’s just tolerable. Also with my medical conditions there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot I can really do aside from exist &amp; keep doing what I’m doing.

I used to look forward to &amp; long for the day that I could start doing some proper travelling &amp; seeing the world. But I don’t have the money. Now I’m at a point where even if I did have the money, what would I do? I don’t know.
What’s the point of traveling to x country to go to the beach when you can do that at home. What’s so great about architecture, you just look at pictures of it. What’s so great about eating cuisine from x country when you have a million restaurants at home that you can eat the same thing made by x people from x country. Why bother seeing that attraction when I can just look at pictures of it &amp; avoid the people everywhere?
Even typing this I realise how cynical it all sounds &amp; I’m wanting to scream at myself for sounding like an absolute downer. I had soo many things I wanted to do in terms of experiences &amp; now I feel like I don’t care anymore. It doesn’t mean anything.

My family are so far away &amp; I can’t talk to my Dad about my problems because I know all he will do is listen, then tell my Mum about it &amp; she will aggressively confront me about it. I can’t talk to my Mum about things because well it’d probably take a year or more of therapy sessions to get through my issues related to our relationship. I have a brother who is going through a lot himself. He suffers from anxiety &amp; depression, we do have lovely conversations but I don’t want to unload all my stuff on him. He’s made so much progress for himself recently &amp; i really don’t want to jeopardise that. My older sister has her own life &amp; while we are on good terms, we rarely speak &amp; she’s a very private person who I don’t feel comfortable to talk to about this sort of stuff.

I can’t talk to my husband about it anymore because it’s bringing him down &amp; he gets frustrated. He seems very focused on playing video games a lot more &amp; maybe spends an hour or 2 with me a day at best. 

I have no friends anymore. All my Australian friends have moved on with their lives &amp; no one keeps in touch. I’ve tried to reach out to a couple of people over the years but it’s like pulling teeth from a horse. You get yes or no answers or just one sentence to that paragraph you just sent. I totally get it; either you don’t want anything to do with me anymore &amp; are just being polite or you don’t have the time to talk to me anymore, fair enough. I’m not going to jump up &amp; down screaming I need your attention.
I don’t have any friends in Canada either &amp; well I wouldn’t even know how to make friends with people now.

Interactions with people nowadays just seem so damn fake. No one has real conversations, just people asking what you did on the weekend or how you are &amp; you better answer appropriately by saying  something like ‘I’m good thanks how are you?’ Because anything less than good means you’re ruining everyone else’s day by not being happy. The only moderately genuine social interactions I have are the conversations I have on subreddits, that’s it.

I wanted to set goals for myself, but I don’t even know what goals I’d set. I’m getting myself out of debt slowly so yeah good. I have an idea what I want to do regarding further education for a new career, but beyond that, I really can’t see any joy in my life. I have nothing to look forward to, I currently have nothing I enjoy, I don’t know how to look for joy. Everything I used to think about now seems so bleak &amp; pointless &amp; I don’t know why.

I just want to go to sleep &amp; stay there.",15Aug2019,1
176,Thankyou so much everyone for how kind youve been.I really appreciate it.All day during school when i got the chance to check my phone thered be a new comment.Everyone here is so sweet and supportive.It really helped me today.I feel happy now.I was able to talk it out with my boyfriend.It was a missunderstanding in my scared panicked state and he said he felt awful for doing that to me.Everything feels okay now.Hes done everything he could to make me feel happy again.Hes also being his annoying stupid self.Due to a past relationship i panic when he suddenly stops talking to me because that was the start of the end of that.And it just got worse.The girl he dated made it her goal to rub it in my face everyday that she was dating him and that she was better then me.It abslutley destroyed me.I didnt eat i just cried i was out of school for a week just to come back to her doing the same thing.No one supported me then at all.Thankyou so much for being kind everyone.Also that same guy is someone i still have to be around and a constant reminder.Considering he has always has tried to pull at my feelings multiple times.I really really wanna move schools guys.But for now im happy.Thanks to all of you for being so kind and sweet.Thankyou everyone,15Aug2019,4
177,"Just wondering, have a couple friends who have had some rough shit happen, granted some of it was self inflicted, but still not easy going through and they also struggle with depression. I noticed they go in spurts where they talk to you a lot over a couple months...and then go radio silent and only pop in once or twice a month to talk.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been tough because i care for them, but i understand they have to put themselves first.  Just looking for any feedback from people who struggle similar to my 2 friends.",15Aug2019,1
