1,"Hello, long time brewing. I have a job that i (usually) like that pays well (kinda poorly, but well for the area I live in and my minimal education, about 40k). I am distinctly unhappy most of the time.

I struggle with alcohol. I've used up all of my pto for the year and have a verbal warning for unexcused absences, but I work extremely hard and my boss is aware of my value to the company and I don't feel my job is in danger unless I miss again before the new year (I had some real illness early in the year, but many of the misses have been due to alcohol or anxiety. I have 6. My boss has been candid about his distaste for issuing a warning, but it's policy and I completely understand and expressed that I don't desire any unusual treatment. He is very compassionate, but I think he is aware of my alcohol abuse. Never at or before work, though.)

I've lived with a roommate... forever. Never lived alone (29m). I now make enough that I could afford my own place, but my current roommate wouldn't be able to afford his own. We've lived together for the majority of 8 or 9 years and he doesn't work, collects disability and is already pushing it at our current costs. My mental health struggles have increased this past year and I've sought some refuge by staying with my mom for a bit some months ago, which was wonderful. I've realized that the time with my mom had been so helpful because in addition to some motherly love, we had nearly opposite schedules which led to a lot of alone time and sole peace. I believe what I need most is my own space and control of who comes and goes, how clean it is, etc. I don't dislike my roommate or his friends at all, but I also wish sometimes that I had quiet, alone time on my weekends and evenings. I'm currently at a hotel for a night to get away because I found a cheap deal in the city my sister lives in.

I feel fettered because I don't want to put my friend/roommate in a position where he has to make a major life change and possibly move cities, but I also don't wish to flog myself and my mental health in place of it. I'm lost.",06Oct2019,2

3,"I'll be honest I don't think my mental health is nearly as bad or in need of as much help as most other people here. But recently I've been feeling pretty down. Nothing I do makes me happy or brings me much pleasure, and I've been having a bit of trouble staying engaged in school. I guess if anyone has any suggestions please let me know. Anything helps, thanks.",06Oct2019,1
5,"A quick warning that the description may sound really weird, it felt weird writing it out.

The habits are: I love to lightly scratch over scabs because I liked the feeling; I like to touch soft fabric, and soft things in general; I like rubbing my hard dry skin over my soft skin because of the scratching feeling; I lick my lips a lot.

These behaviours have never really bothered me to be honest. It's not the weirdest thing and it's harmless, but I was wondering if it could mean anything.

I'm open to your thoughts on this.",06Oct2019,1
6,"My doctor put me off work for two weeks. I haven‚Äôt been able to eat, sleep, or take care of myself properly. I‚Äôm in a pretty bad place.

I asked a friend of mine to hang out tonight. Said no because they had dinner with their parents. Now they‚Äôre hanging out with friends near my house (we live about an hour away from one another) &amp; I‚Äôm just stuck home.

7,"I‚Äôm going to the doctors this Monday for an issue that‚Äôs unrelated to mental health but I‚Äôd like to finally talk about my mental health as well. 

It took years for my parents to come to terms that there‚Äôs an issue (they didn‚Äôt really accept it and blamed other stuff, which may have not helped my mental health but I was still in a bad place). I‚Äôm scared my doctor might not believe or understand me either. Scared that he‚Äôll say it‚Äôs just normal and I‚Äôm overthinking/being stupid but on the other hand I‚Äôm not really sure how to say how I feel without possibly being admitted or something. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know how healthcare works around mental health, I‚Äôve just kept my head low with it and hoped it would go, but it hasn‚Äôt. 

I don‚Äôt really know how to ask for help when I‚Äôm conflicted that there‚Äôs even an issue at all and I‚Äôm doubting my own brain. 

Last time I saw this doctor too, I broke down (I was getting a letter to suspend my exams because of personal issues related to mental health) So I guess he knows some of it but he might‚Äôve also forgotten because it‚Äôs a busy surgery. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is the right sub or not to post this.

I Googled some but couldn't find anything for MENTAL health -- just for physiological stuff.",06Oct2019,1
14,"I haven‚Äôt always been a loner but it‚Äôs been the story of most of my life.  When I was very young I was the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of a group of misfit kids in a poor neighborhood living the typical day poverty life.  I don‚Äôt know what changed beyond my parents divorce but I flipped the script shortly after.  Personality totally reversed and I shut out the world.  I remained the misfit kid but became the one that no one knew.  If any social title cliche remained with me it was as the ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù.  

My father was never home.  For a period of years our mother ditched out and he was left to fend with raising us four kids with a shitty pay paper route job.  We lived in poverty with little to show for ourselves.  The poverty did eventually go away with the introduction of my ‚Äústepmother‚Äù however the wisdom of experience reveals to you that some struggles aren‚Äôt worth trading off for the introduction of others.  I can‚Äôt claim the saddest story in history after all I wasn‚Äôt physically abused and we did find our way out of absolute poverty.  

However I became the poster child of verbal abuse.  My siblings were older and got out of the house pretty quickly but I was rather stuck.  The step monster berated my daily existence and I could do nothing right.  Here is the irony,  by the point she came into our lives I NEVER misbehaved.  For whatever reason I was terrified of her and I toed the line as well as I possibly could.  However whatever paranoid delusions she suffered from made it impossible to please her.  Any event of misfortunate or minor irritation that occurred in her environment the blame was always assigned to me.  Somehow she always envisioned that I was the puppet master behind all wrong in her life.  

Due in part to  that environment I never developed socially.  I never went out, I never left my room, and I talked to no one about anything ever.  Even if I had managed to make a friend I would have never brought them into that environment to see what my daily life was.  I felt pathetic and powerless.  I began to resent the world and succumbed to very dark poetry/writing the remainder of my childhood.  

I did bring myself out of that environment as soon as possible.  However I feel the damage had already been done.  I am an absolute social recluse hermit to the point it‚Äôs psychological.  Crowded places and unfamiliar environments seriously effect me like a phobia.  I make zero exaggeration when I say that I made no friends in high school, none in college, and continue that pathway into adult life. 

Despite the fact that I find comfort in my home environment and space from others, the loneliness is absolutely crushing.  I live all week for the weekend and find myself spending weekends wondering what I was waiting for.  Monotony and routines both comfort me and torture me.  I fear the unexpected but I suffocate on the predictability of the live to work life.  I find myself wondering what the point is at all on many occasions.  I go to sleep many times wondering what purpose ever waking back up brings.  

I toe the line of suicidal ideation but I‚Äôm too much of a coward to ever cross it.  A religious upbringing has me afraid of a sentence to hell from a God I‚Äôm not convinced exists.  I don‚Äôt have much around in the terms of family but I also don‚Äôt seek to transfer the pain onto them.  The darkness inside consumes me like an infection though.  I feel it everyday just below the surface eating away at my resolve.  I know so much of life is perspective but I can‚Äôt seem to free myself from this cycle.  

There is more to my story but I feel I‚Äôve rattled on to an imaginary audience long enough at this point.   

Also as an FYI for any concerned:  I am totally the implosive type.  I would never hurt others, if anything ever only myself.",06Oct2019,2

17,"I hate my brain, and I hate myself so much

I hate how the slightest thing sets me off into a spiral of fear,
worry, stress and anxiety and the catastrophe of things that could happen 

I work in a hospital and I have seen so many young people come in for the regular stomachache or headaches but it turns out that they have cancers and tumors

I can't help but worry about all these especially to the closest people around me. These days it has become so bad that when my husband complain about a stomachache, I immediately worth about a tumor and his death and what it's like when he dies and then my life isn't worth living anymore too 

I always worry about the worst possible outcome that could happen and this causes me an insane amount of stress and fear of that happening. I worry the plane is going to crash, or things like that

I know these thoughts aren't helpful nor rational, but focusing on that makes me even more stressed out and anxious. The moment I have thoughts like that I tell myself that they're irrational and to ignore them but it doesn't take away the stress and fear and anxiety that comes with it 

I hate that I think this way. I don't even know how I got here. I don't have any diagnosis, not that it matters anyway. 

Today it has gotten really bad. I sat there wondering about how I should take my own life. It made me feel so calm thinking about the planning of it. I would settle all my outstanding finances like rent and credit card bills, I would leave usernames and passwords to my bank and bill accounts so that family can do the needful. I would pack all my stuff in boxes and luggages and leave them by the front door so that they will be easy to move and family won't have to go through the trouble of packing. I would make sure the house is neat and clean other than the bathroom I would lay towels on the bathroom floor so that it's clean. I would leave a note just to apologize for the inconvenience I have caused, and thank them for sorting out all these adminstrative things for me. I felt so calm thinking of all these

My uncle lived at home his whole life till he was 67 and then he passed away.

I've finally hit a breaking point. There's consequences for people I like if I don't keep up with the pace. I still get motivated by my manager, like the people involved, find the work interesting, and care about the outcome of my work. I just really need to vomit every time I sit down to work on it. I can't keep focused long enough to get anything done, or avoid simple oversights.

I got strung along with a lot of promises that don't look like they'll pan out.  I really need to deliver to get the main payoff on this and not lose my own sunk costs, but the way things are looking, it will be more than a year before I might be able to work just this one job.

I actually got a month off from said stressful job, just chilling at my easy job. It hasn't restored my drive for the stressful job. I realize I'm burned out from juggling the two, but I was hoping a break from the one would ease some drive for it back in my life. It really hasn't.

But my whole family. (6 older siblings, and parents) have told me I‚Äôm awful, I have been a liar this whole year about my health, or they can‚Äôt handle my mental health. Like I‚Äôm sorry mom that you physically and verbally have abused me my whole life and fucked me up. I‚Äôm sorry that I was a neglected child, especially when the first grand baby came into the world when I was 5. 

I don‚Äôt really have anyone but my partner, my best friend, and my cats. I know if I die it‚Äôll devastate them though. Like I wouldn‚Äôt even want my family to know if I did.

31,"My mom has paranoid personality disorder (or something of the sort) and absolutely refuses to get treatment, seek help, or manage her anger outbursts. It's at the point my dad is heavily considering divorce after 4 kids and 23 years of marriage. My mom believes the neighbors are stalking her and that one is a famous celebrity who is in love with her, has bodyguards, the police ""are involved"", and that he communicates with her through means of the media. 

The actual neighbors happen to have a loud car and she always thinks that whenever they rev their engine, its actually this ""celebrity"" trying to communicate with her. She thinks the entire neighborhood stalks her and follows her EVERYWHERE she goes. She believes the entire neighborhood wants to harm her and is serving said celebrity. 

Whenever I'm with her in the car, she will always say one of the people is following us. When I ask her how she knows, she says she remembers the license plates, so when I ask what the license # is, no response. She never has concrete answers to her suspicions. She is very reglious I must add. So, she will have outbursts all the time over non meaningful events. For example, the OTHER neighbors(not the celebrity) will get in their car and leave. Then she will point, very dramatically, being like ""THANK YOU JESUS FOR REMOVING THIS BURDEN AND EVIL FROM MY DAY!"" And I mean like yelling and jumping. 

There are times when she will not talk to my dad all day because of issues that are literally non existent, like him being ""mad because she doesnt work"" and she will make an argument even though my dad says nothing of the sort. She fed my cat over a weekend at my apartment, telling me that my neighbors worked for earlier mentioned celebrity and were asking her about dad. She is also convinced my neighbors dogs are completely evil and out to get her. It's not my mom anymore. It hurts. 

My parents wifi was going slow due to having the basic package and 10 devices.

33," 

Ten years of high key depression. At least, it will be ten years on December 21st. When I was 12, I had my first full wave of Depression. From those idiotic depths rose my first suicidal thought. It scared me then, it scares me now. What hasn‚Äôt changed is that I still have them. 

I fundamentally hate myself, my life, those around me, and having those feelings. Years of bullying through middleschool and high school, a friend‚Äôs suicide, my sister‚Äôs assault, being born with autism and prosopagnosia and vocal defects, being treated like an outsider, traumatic first two years at college, isolating myself during my third year at college, and constantly needing to meet my family‚Äôs expectations. 

What did that give me? Well, how about heaping portions of social paranoia, doubts of self-worth, alienation from others, lack of hope in the future, hatred of my deviancies, a dozen phobias, and plenty of sobbing nights? That good enough?

What did it cost me? Apart from the ten years of my life, of course? This is the one that hurts the most, the pain of what could have been. I lost friendships, the possibility of connections, adventures in high school, social life in college, getting better academically, getting into a shape that I didn‚Äôt hate every time I saw myself in a mirror, having a romantic relationship, meeting a variety of people, getting new skills, experiencing more art, working on my writing, taking advantage of resources, deepening friendships, and a plethora of other missed lives.

What I want to make clear is that it wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt try. No, I tried so hard. So much effort went into not just making sure that I survived, but trying to thrive as well. Good fucking job on that though, ‚Äòcause that never worked out in the end. Exercising, social contact, therapy, art, classes, the whole shebang. So much time and energy spent on hanging onto hope. Fat lot of good that did.

One of my few friends told me a few days ago as I was breaking down under the stress of the upcoming Anniversary, strain of schoolwork, and general depression that I might just be a ‚Äúlate bloomer.‚Äù I wanted to scream at her,  A late to bloom to fucking what? Life? That all of the shit of the last decade was just a process I had to go through to be happy? That it was just my coming of age? My therapist told me that some people look to their trauma as having some good, of making them stronger. What a crock of shit. Implying that never pushed myself to get better. That any of this was good. 

So much time trying to be happy, to improve me, to deal with my trauma, to overcome my idiosyncrasies, to find connection with the world. It doesn‚Äôt fucking work. It never works. It is pitiful, just letting myself and everyone around me down.

They say it gets better, that this is just a stage, that everyone feels this way at some point, that if I just keep at it I‚Äôll be happy again. For so long I believed them. I don‚Äôt know if I do anymore. 

I feel like a geist haunting the crowd. Unreal. Reverse solipsism. Vessel filled by others.

This isn‚Äôt a suicide note, there isn‚Äôt any point to that. My existence makes others happy and its absence would cripple others. Waking up in the morning and feeling overwhelmed by the effort to do everything may be horrid to me, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to harm other people through my removal.  

When I instituioonalized myself at the beginning of the year, a therapist told me that if I don‚Äôt make strides to get better I‚Äôll kill myself before I turn 40. I won‚Äôt, I know that for certain. The facts are that I‚Äôm unfixable, that has been demonstrated. However, I‚Äôm also not selfish enough to commit to finality. What will occur is the drifting life of pointlessness till I die. 

So much effort has been put into removing the lyrical loneliness, doubt, failure, alienation, and depression. Ten years of my life feel like they have been stolen. There is no indication of becoming better nor is there a signal of me being able to leave. Ten years.

I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôve wasted your time.",06Oct2019,3
34,"I don't know how to put this but I'm gonna try the best I can.
I need help in deciding, rather weighing it to a certainly ""Yes"" or ""No"".
I know this is stupid to put it forth like this but please bear with me. God, this sounds so absurd and confusion inducing in my mind.

I want to place forth my opinions at times but I can't, because I overthink and my mind steams up like a kettle at ready to whistle, all that to just cool down later on; likewise is the case for me when and where I want to have discussions especially with my parents and I suddenly stop and in turn get irritated because of thinking about how would they react to it.

I am tired if pitying myself for years and at times it seems like I cry and cry alone and put on this ""I'm okay and everything's gonna be fine as well"" mask. Everytime I cry, my body feels like it's done crying and is deprived of anymore tears and in turn feels like everything within has been dried up and I'm trying hard to even cry and stiffens up from shoulders and around and to be precise it's a ghost pain that never actually is found anywhere, when I try easing myself and rubbing my back. My mood swings are wrecked up, my sleep cycle is shaken and my concentration levels are, I think, gone. I don't take pride in it and this really shames and tags me from within but I still have my back logs left. Papers which were supposed to be cleared by last year are still hanging up above my head like a guillotine of shame that's gonna drop-chop me any moment and will haunt me forever. I even had an emotional outburst like anxiety attack during one of my final semester paper presentation which made me feel guilty and like a fool out of myself that day. Everytime I decide to take control of it, something else is already waiting for me to fall back and put all the efforts again. It's like I am trying my best to move on but am being pulled back instead.

Making new friends isn't an easy thing for me and let alone the idea of dating. Really! I, during my college times, had this uneasy feeling of getting out of my room and going out and since that day, mind you that it's 5 years ago, I am struggling to go out on my own. It feels like the left over of what we're like horrifying years for me where cultural shock, body shaming, bullying happened, all that topped with college drama and stalking messages haunting me for the first year of my college as well (which I think is the reason why I feel anxious in going out alone). All this topped with acceptance, body and trust issues and approx. seven and half years of being in the closet and scared for rest of those years followed by ""Okay but don't tell your Dad though"" reaction from my mother while I came out to her as homosexual, made me break into several miserable pieces.

Now I try hiding all that with that bitchy, sassy and unwelcoming behaviour towards others which makes me hurt them and in turn hurt me everyday because I know that this is not the person I am or am supposed to be.

So far, this post sounds like a desperate attention seeking stuff and yells ""Pity for me"" but please, honestly, don't. I am done pitying myself and I don't wanna deal with the Pity cards on the table anymore.

All I want is help in deciding whether should I go and seek out help from a professional and if I go to therapy then how do I stay strong and not let the best of me dragged down by those unsupportive ""This much for just single therapy session? Oh, my"" kinda remarks from my Mother Dearest which had already halt me from continuing my previous therapy sessions being followed up.

Long story short: Anyone reading this, please tell me that I am not the only one like this here. Am I?

Thank you for reading it this far.",06Oct2019,1
35,"There are times where I get extremely overwhelmed and become antsy or restless. These words are not strong enough though. There is this wave of just absolute helplessness; to fight it off I have to move, I have to hit something, or I have to hurt myself. If I don't, it feels like I'll just drown in that wave and I can't breathe. I often get a racing heart or racing thoughts as well, but there are times I'm paralyzed. Well, I mean if I really had to get up I actually could, but in that mental state I *feel* frozen and trapped. I'll break out of it only really to go and hurt myself. I immediately jump to suicidal thoughts too. In the past, this is how I started down the road of self-harming. I felt out of control. I know I have high functioning depression, and I'm under constant pressure. I would be in class, step out to the bathroom, self-harm, and then return to class as if literally nothing happened. It cleared my head and I could refocus and just get back to work, like a robot rebooting itself. (This is not me trying to condone it.) I should also mention I used to dissociate in the past due to childhood trauma, etc.

Does this sound like a symptom of anxiety? Or is it a different phenomenon?",06Oct2019,1
36,"Strap yourselves in because this is gonna be a long one. I'll try to be as detailed as possible.  
(Feel free to ask me anything if you need more info).

Before I start listing my ""evidence,"" I want to let you know that most, if not all, of what I am about to describe is textbook BBC Sherlock Holmes. When I first watched Sherlock in 2013, I instantly related to Cumberbatch's Holmes more than I have to anything else in my life. I think this is why. I am nowhere near a super genius like him, but I am the same when it comes to his attitude towards people (usually irritated/angry and considering everyone to be pathetic and stupid), not understanding or even caring when when he/I do or say something considered by others to be rude or inappropriate, and (most importantly), general empathy.

What makes me so unsure about this self-diagnosis is severe anxiety and depression. From 16 through to 18, I was very lost. I couldn't understand my place in the world and why people were consistently angry with me/absolutely despising me just because of one thing I said. It's difficult to say that you're an empathetic sociopath, but that you also have depression. I can definitely say that the depression came from my anxiety. And I think I know why. At that time, I had very little friends. Previously, I'd had a friend group (I got bored of them and moved on) that adored me. They did everything I wanted to do. We hung out with who I wanted to hang out with. Anyone I didn't like wasn't allowed to be near us. And my opinion was always right. When I left that group because of all the stupid drama from relationships and whatever else, I ended up alone in a giant school with hundreds of people who hated me. No one admired me. No one treated me like I was this fantastic being that is never wrong (a slight exaggeration, but you get my point). They all told me I was wrong, rude, arrogant, and asshole, a bitch, obnoxious, stupid, ugly. It felt horrible. 

The anxiety on the other hand, has been around since I was a child. It developed from people getting mad at me for something I did or didn't do. Because that meant they didn't admire me as much as they used to, so I started to regret and regret until it became anxiety. 

I know this sounds more like narcissistic personality disorder, but hear me out. When my doctor prescribed me an anti-depressant, I started to realise who I was. Once I was in a calm enough state of mind to really think about myself and my actions, etc, I began to notice things. For example, I was recently bombarded with a memory of the time I used to easily burst into (fake) tears and sob in front of my teachers - I told them I couldn't do the homework because my mum was in hospital with a damaged spine and was essentially on the verge of death. In reality, I just didn't do the homework because I had better things to do, in my opinion. I was 11 years old.

I said the same to get out of PE. It became my go-to lie in manipulating people into doing what I want (or letting me get away with I wanted to do). My friends would buy me expensive burgers and lollies from the school food station because ""dad hasn't gone shopping and there's no food at home."" I lied to those friends a lot. Abby and Lana - this is obviously not their real names - often fought and I was the centrepiece. Most of the time they fought because Abby had confided in me and confessed she hated something about Lana, and I'd tell Lana what she said because I was interested to see what would happen, or vice versa. I liked being the centre of their attention. When they were friends, they'd spend more time together than with me so I used to spread little white lies to keep them away from each other. 

Speaking of friends, I never really cared about any of them. A lot of my self-proclaimed best friends were just people that were beneficial to me. Maia had a dog I thought was really cute, so I'd spend nights at her house a lot to play with it until I got my own dog. Then I didn't need her anymore. Meg used to bring lots of good food to school and I wanted it, so I pretended to be her friend to get sushi or chocolates out of her. I used to cry and manipulate everyone into thinking I was severely injured by a soccer ball just so they would pay more attention to me. It pissed me off when they wouldn't listen or exclude me. 

That attitude was from when I was a child, though, and it probably stemmed from my anxiety. I ""cried"" to force people to hang out with me. I lied over and over about all these amazing things to make them think I was amazing. It was fascinating to me. Watching people soak up all of my bullshit was a fun hobby. 

I also once pretended to care when one of my ""besties"" mother died. She was nice, I guess. Gave me good cookies, but apparently I was supposed to be bawling over her passing. Or I was at least supposed to feel sad for my friend who lost his mother. I was more interested in the idea of seeing a dead body. I wanted to know how cold she'd feel. I wanted to pull her fingers and see if they still moved. Unfortunately, I wasn't invited to the funeral. But I thought about it for years.

Back to now. I still watch people. Although I don't lie as much, I do find myself often drifting into a head space where I start thinking about all the ways I could murder the people near me. I like hurting people and watching people get hurt. I can tell you now, that it's not because I'm psycho and I wanted to go on a killing spree. What feels like the best explanation for it is that pain is something that makes me feel close to empathising with someone. I know how pain feels, and so do they, so I guess it's a way of being able to ""put myself in someone else's shoes,"" if you know what I mean. Like I can better understand how I'm ""supposed"" to feel in a situation.

My boyfriend lets me pop his pimples. I'm very aggressive about it, to be honest. I will admit it's been extremely tempting to find out what would happen if I poked the needle deep enough to draw blood. One time, when I didn't have a needle, I used a scalpel, and I was very close to wanting to drag it down his back. I was, and still am, curious. My theory is that I subconsciously feel that doing something so thrilling like murdering someone might jumpstart my empathy/emotions. 

Sam has acknowledged how I feel and he has accepted me and that I ""love"" him in my own way. I can't say at all that I feel something for him. I like him more than anyone else. He comforts me, I can relax around him, and I don't mind him touching me at all (usually, I don't want anyone sitting or standing close to me). But I cannot say that I love him. It feels like what tiny emotion I may have for him isn't strong enough to be considered love. I do want to be around him though, I know that, and I don't want to lose the physical comfort I get from his (and only his) hugs. 

Mentally/emotionally, I feel nothing for Sam. I wanted to reiterate this because it's important. Physically, I am comforted. Emotionally, I couldn't give a flying fuck. I don't get a cutesy warm feeling when he kisses my forehead. My heart doesn't speed up and my pupils never dilate when he gives me gifts, but his always do when I give gifts to him. I don't understand how he feels about me at all. Because to me, ""love"" is just being physically comfortable around someone.

Sam himself thinks I am a sociopath after doing some research. He is an academic with an interest in psychology and biology, so he knows the basics.

When it comes to my family, I don't love any of them. I never have. I never realised it as a child because I thought everyone was exactly the same as me but thinking back on it now, I have always felt nothing for my family. Being quick to anger as a child, I did hit my brothers a lot. I stole hundreds of dollars from my dad's car to spend on lollies and I pretended it was one of my brothers that did it. My mother pissed me off constantly but I pretended she didn't. I once had a dream she burned alive in lava right in front of me and it didn't even occur to me until today that that should've been considered a nightmare. But I've never had a nightmare. None of my dreams have made me happy, sad, or scared. There was always just... nothing. I've never been comfortable with them, especially not now.

I don't feel anything at all. I want to be as clear as possible here because it's actually really hard to describe. When I do something I consider fun - a roller coaster, a movie I've never seen before, having a night out with my mates - I can feel a sort of pressure in my chest and head that pumps a good feeling through me. Like adrenaline. But once the moment is over, I feel nothing. Thinking back on those good times, it's like looking at a sheet and saying ""that needs to be washed."" It's more of an acknowledgement that something happened rather than a happy memory of an enjoyable day.

My doctor thinks this ""emptiness"" is an effect of the depression. But that feels wrong to me. I've been suspicious over ASPD since I was 15, and it's the only diagnosis that speaks to me. I hope you can understand how it feels to instinctively know that you're right, but everyone else tells you you're wrong. I've never felt empty in a sad, my soul is drained kind of way because there was never anything to drain. Except for the anxiety that was poisoning me and blocking my true self.

Thanks to everyone who made it this far down. I think I've detailed everything that I can, but feel free to ask any questions. I'll answer pretty much anything.  

\-----------

TL;DR - I recently realised that I'm an empathetic person that feels nothing except for mild curiosity/fascination. I've lied, manipulated friends/family/teachers because I could, and I can't enjoy something unless it's something thrilling or new. I truly believe and feel that I am a sociopath but my doctor says I'm not qualified to self-diagnose, so I'm looking for other people's opinions. Am I a sociopath?",06Oct2019,2

41,"17 years ago, I chickened out of a sincere suicide attempt. I was taken seriously by the doctors (GAF of 5/100 by the DSM-IV) but did not care for any of their help, and a solid diagnosis eluded me on that first trip to the hospital. 

While I was committed, I experienced a weird euphoric epiphany that was less an illness than an awakening. The established response was: ‚ÄúTake these, or we won‚Äôt let you out.‚Äù

Several years on and a long history tracking down to today, I feel bamboozled. I‚Äôm stuck on the medications on account of the challenges I experience trying to release myself from them.

But I‚Äôm curious what I‚Äôm like underneath, if there‚Äôs any of me left, or if my brain is simply damaged and unrecoverable. 

The only doctor-sanctioned experiments toward my freedom have been ultra-cautious tapers that always have a drastic effect. Tear the bandaid off slowly, dip the toe in the chilly part of the shallow pool. It never goes well and I always end up where I started. 

It seems to me as though the meds have embedded themselves in my brain, such that any attempt to extract myself from their invasion would result in a hole that wouldn‚Äôt have been there without their influence in the first place.

I don‚Äôt have the support mechanisms to try to go off of them cold turkey. My friends tend to be rational and not so ‚Äúwoo‚Äù so it is not likely anyone around me will question the established wisdom that I need them. 

I wasn‚Äôt textbook bipolar or schizoaffective. The first medical thought was that I was autistic. I was undeniably socially isolated, though my taxing environment (cookie-cutter elite college) was well over 90% of that issue. 

But if I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúgotten caught‚Äù for suicide, the meds would not have happened. The ONLY reason I am on this medicine is that I had wanted to die. Every other rationalization around my symptoms was spun up to circle this fact.

I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnobody‚Äù and ‚Äúnothing‚Äù before the medication. I was arguably quite lonely, but I wasn‚Äôt terribly crazy. I had thoughts, feelings, and a rich inner life that I just didn‚Äôt want to share. The suicide was justified, if perhaps premature, or maybe not the best or only solution. 

But meds aren‚Äôt the only solution either. There has to be some challenge to this conventional protocol that robs unusual people of our personhood. 

TLDR- I am stuck on medication and will never again know what‚Äôs underneath. I consider my predicament unfair.",06Oct2019,2
42,"If anyone can shed some light on my mentality I would greatly appreciate it. Basically I am aware that my ""happy"" thoughts are not like a normal persons but I don't feel ashamed for my thoughts. I simply understand that the way I think is controversial to the typical person. I think about hurting someone and I feel happy, I think about war and its endless carnage and death and my heartbeat goes through the roof and I get shaky with adrenaline. Basically an act or thought of violence is my happy place, I have no real feelings for people except a single family member of mine. The rest I just have a feeling of indifference or hatred, they just seem idiotic and a waste of oxygen. I am not sure how long I have felt this way but as far as I can remember it was about third grade when I quit caring completely. Even as early as second grade I remember being scolded for bringing up violence in class. I also have a strong desire to break things and hurt people at the slightest upset. I truly do not understand other peoples emotions and when people come to me for sympathy it often makes me feel sick though I don't fully understand why. Something about emotional conversations give me the strong urge to ignore the person or leave entirely. Does any of this make me wrong? Or am I normal? I have never felt like I was wrong but it's obvious that others have time and time again seen me as incorrect in many ways.",06Oct2019,1

For anyone that thinks suicide or self harm are weak or the easy way out or that you just don‚Äôt understand.

To all the people with concerns/issues with mental health. Whether it be stress, depression, anxiety, paranoia, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, cyclothymia, bi polar, psychosis, self harm, eating disorders, OCD and the many more, you will be okay. 

There‚Äôs so many different categories that fall into mental health.  Some may seem worse than others but each thing that an individual feels is just as hard for them as it is for another person that is struggling with something different. They should all be taken as seriously as each other. 

There‚Äôs times where you feel you can‚Äôt go on listening to your unwanted thoughts and voices. There‚Äôs times where you talk back to the voice that‚Äôs talking to you and there‚Äôs times where you listen to it rather than fight against it.  Times where you stay in your house and miss out on things you do want to do and times where you say fuck you and go out and do it.  Times where you lay in bed and can‚Äôt move and can‚Äôt think and times where you physically roll yourself out of bed and say get on with it.  
Times where you hear/see things that aren‚Äôt there and feel scared or times where you say this isn‚Äôt actually happening and continue to ignore it or just embrace it. 
Times where you are at breaking point and cave in to eating/making yourself sick/self harming and times where you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough‚Äù and ignore every bad thought you have and do what you want and don‚Äôt feel bad about it. 
Sometimes thinking ‚ÄúHave I left the door unlocked ‚Äú and going back and checking it over and over even though you tried it 4 times before you left, telling those thoughts to leave your mind and that you shouldn‚Äôt doubt yourself.  Feeling proud that you‚Äôve been able to stay out and not go back and that the door is locked and the straighteners and hob are off. 

Every single one of those thoughts and decisions are okay. 

Supposedly, most people experience some sort of mental health issue in their life at least  once.
It‚Äôs the people that have experienced it, whether it be once or 35 times, they will be the ones to pull themselves together to try and stop you feeling that way.  They will do anything they can to stop another person feeling that way and that‚Äôs strength. And anyone that is struggling for the first time, they should take the help of those that reach out because they are the ones that see the signs and want to be there.

50,"WARNING: MANY WORDS INCOMING. FOR CONCLUSION, READ THE LAST 4 PARAGRAPHS

I'm struggling with anxiety and depression for as long as I remember. I vaguely remember being very social when I was little though, but Then, suddenly, I became very anxious and shy. My parents told me that one day, I came home, crying, telling them that I never wanted to play ever again; something obviously happened, but my parents couldn't get me to talk about it. To this day I've never remembered why it was that I suddenly became so anxious. After that, I stopped seeking out friends, except this one quiet shy girl who I could level with. I was anxious for the rest of my life, with bouts of depression hitting me later in my teens and early twenties. I was always more worried than I needed to be and had trouble making and keeping social contacts. Eventually I started smoking weed, a lot. It helped me socialize a bit and getting a group of close friends. Unfortunately this became an addiction which stayed with me from when I was 16 till my 22nd.

When I was 22 I started therapy, again. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, ADD and depression. My therapist asked me if I was open to trying antidepressants. I did a lot of research and decided I wanted to try Bupropion because of its better side effect profile compared to other antidepressants (SSRI/SNRI)

3 days in. I'm sitting on the couch and started to feel a bit off. I looked at the corner of my room. It felt the corner started to warp in weird shapes, as if I was sinking away in my own body, getting more and more detaching with reality every second. My heart started pounding faster and faster. It felt like I was going crazy or was having a psychosis. When looking back, this was the moment I had my first panic attack. It was the most terrifying moment of my whole life. 

I decided that I wouldn't let this happen to me and I surely wouldn't let myself get psychotic. I stopped taking bupropion, stopped smoking weed, started exercising 4-5 times a week and meditated almost every day. The depression lifted for the most part and I became less anxious. The panic attacks still kept coming but less frequently every month. Eventually, now 4 years later, I maybe have 1 moment a month where I feel a Panic attack coming up, but I'm much more in control of it. I must say I also had CBT during this time, although I didn't really have a good therapist. I always got the that she never quite understood how to deal with me during sessions, something she admitted when I stopped therapy when I was feeling good enough. Her CBT tactics just never really got to me.

Unfortunately, my symptoms came back last year. Sleeping all day, not going out to friends, always staying inside and being anxious when going to my lectures. I didn't really exercise for about two years and I still am not able to get myself to regularly do so again. I started skipping classes, following less courses and eventually following no class at all. I was sad almost all of the time. 

I decided I wanted to give antidepressants another try, this time I went to my GP and he gave me Sertraline. It made me feel very out of touch with the moment. One time I was so spaced out that I even almost put soup onto a plate instead of a bowl. I went back to my GP and asked for Escitalopram. The out of toucb feeling went away after a few days and after two weeks my sadness was gone. Luckily I had almost no side effects from Escitalopram, even no sexual ones. I noticed I didn't NOT want to do things, so at least that was a good sign. Unfortunately I never got to the point I did start doing things. It just made me feel fine with doing nothing. 

I went back to my GP and told him I couldn't finish my studies this way. I felt fine but couldn't get myself to start doing anything; doing less than the bare minimum for my classes. I told him I wanted to give Bupropion another try, since it is used off label for ADD treatment and the current situation is different from the first time. I don't smoke weed anymore for a few years now and quit smoking sigarettes last January. I also felt like the Escitalopram did noticably lessen my anxiety, so with these things in mind I told him I dare to try Bupropion again. 

__CONCLUSION__ I've been using the combination Escitalopram and Bupropion for two weeks now and developed a problem that's very new to me. I feel like I'm a normal person! How do I deal with this?? Over the years, I got so used to feeling that things were wrong with me. Even during the period where my depression was low I still felt like I wasn't normal and had major self-esteem issues. But now, my anxiety is gone. I can actively do things again. I even went to a party yesterday and had a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it and had a big smile on my face the the whole time! And best of all: it all felt so natural. As if this is how 'normal' people feel. My emotions don't feel blunted or exaggerated, just very balanced and naturally responding to things.

I really need to get used to this 'feeling normal' thing though. I see remnants of my anxious mind wondering around, looking for something that's wrong, but they can't find anything. These remnants seem to try to evoke some anxiety, but they have nothing to hold on to and its like they just fail in their attempt. I've read some schema therapy books the last few months and I still see some weak signs of schemas every now and then, but I feel they will subside with time. It's like I've got a whole new me to explore.

To all people having ups and downs, or feel like they only have downs in their life and are hesitant to try antidepressants: don't listen to the horrible stories about antidepressants and definitely don't listen to people who say the meds don't really work. For some people, they do work very well. Finding the right meds, or combo of meds is a path of trial and error, but you might just find the combo that works for you. 

One last advice I want to give is to try and be proactive when seeking for the meds. Do some research, if you're up to it use google scholar and read some abstracts of studies on the meds (because the full papers are usually pay to view) to find out what medications there are and what their effectiveness could be for your problems. Also, find out about their specific side effect profile and drug and substance interactions and talk with your doc about your ideas and findings. Also, for people with long lasting problems, read up on some schema therapy. It really gave me some great insights which I hadn't found in any other self-help book. I read 'reinventing your life' from Jeffrey Young, the creator of schema therapy. I also read a Dutch book about a newer form of Schema Therapy that uses 'schema modi' instead of the maladaptive schemas from Young (life traps is what he calls them in his book). Again, you could look for the effectiveness of schema therapy on google or google scholar. 

Good luck to all, I wish you all the best.",06Oct2019,2
51,The main impacts appear to be social interactions and I'm hoping to find more in depth information on this including things that can be done to manage it. More information on possible personality traits related to a 'very superior' processing speed would also be helpful. Thanks,06Oct2019,3
52,"Surprisingly not many people are aware of the signs and symptoms of depression.  You maybe aware that something is not right but just continue with life and  hope that the feelings of despair will magically go away. 

Some of the signs of depression can be, but not exclusive include:

Low motivation or struggling to meet ones basic needs e.g. taking a shower. 

Hopelessness, a feeling that nothing will help and there is no point to living. 

Over sleeping or under-sleeping. Either one can increase feelings of tiredness 

Critical and negative thoughts of self  and others, such as I‚Äôm not good enough or I am worthless. 

General bleak thoughts about life. Such as I can‚Äôt continue and feelings of nothing is going to help.

Over eating or under eating. 

Depression can be all consuming and at times effect every aspect of our life. It can affect employment, relationships, activities, hobbies and interest. At times it can be very difficult to find a way out of it.  You may even notice feeling stuck in a never ending cycle. 

It is important to distinguish between low mood and depression. In low mood you can still function as a person, however with depression the most simplistic tasks can feel too much to do.

Depression can be caused by many life events that we go through which can include divorce, death of a loved one, losing one‚Äôs job  and so many other reason which would be too long to list here. Often one event does not usually  cause the depression but it can be multiple life events that happen in a short period of time that can effect on how one copes with it. For example learning that a loved one has cancer, going through issues at work and having physical health issues etc. when we have multiple life events happen the mind struggles on how to deal with it, it becomes to much to process. Feeling depressed is the normal response to challenging and difficult life events we go through.

We often hide our depression from loved ones due to the fear of shame and what they will think of us. On many occasions clients have reported  ‚ÄúI hate it that people see me as being weak‚Äù. Being depressed is not a sign of weakness it is usually a sign that for too long you have been dealing with it alone. 

If the above information seems familiar, then perhaps it is time to do something about it. Five things you can do immediately to help  yourself:

1. Talk to someone you trust - by talking to someone about how you are feeling can be a start in a finding a way out. 
2. Get active - do anything from exercising to walking. Leaving the house and doing something that puts a smile to our face can be helpful. 
3. Start socialising - meeting family friends and not spend time alone. Feeling loved can start the healing process. 
4 Get a sense of accomplishment - no matter how small a task this will help the mind to feel a sense achievement. 
5. Eat, love and pray- Meeting our basic needs is essential in improving our well-being. After all they say you are what you eat. Furthermore a good night sleep is also essential in improving your mental health. It is advisable to have approximately 8 hours a sleep a night. I 

These are some of the ways you can start helping yourself to feel better. Each individuals feelings of depression is unique to themselves therefore not all intervention mentioned above will work for everyone.  Also seek advice from your Medical professional before taking any major changes.

54,"A little bit about myself: I‚Äôm a 23 y/o Middle Eastern-American female. I grew up in the United States and have spent 22 years of my life here. My father has also been here for 22 years. He is a hypocrite and claims to hate the way overly religious folks in the Middle East treat women, yet his values and ideals are still so entrenched in our Middle Eastern culture that he is NO different than your image of a stereotypical Muslim male - extremely controlling. I‚Äôve never had autonomy over anything in my life, from the way I dress to the way I express my feelings and emotions. Trying to delve into all of the horrible ways my father raised me would result in this being a longer post than I intend. But a few things worth mentioning are: his love has never been unconditional; he said himself that his sense of honor is more important than me, which meant that I was never allowed to make mistakes and had to always be perfect. He also told me that me expressing emotions other than content made me unintelligent and stupid. My entire life, I feel like I have done everything at all costs to win his approval and hope that that would make him a better father to me. Wrong. 

So, I definitely have ‚Äúdaddy issues.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt been in a single healthy relationship my entire life. The few relationships I‚Äôve been in were SO mentally detrimental that developed severe anxiety and depression as a result. 

I‚Äôm not mentioning any of this information to brag or seem like I‚Äôm full of myself - I have a good job, I have an amazing personality, I‚Äôm a good-looking woman and get a lot of male attention, I‚Äôm intelligent, etc etc. I have a very bubbly personality and come across as this super happy person with a great, positive outlook on life who has so much going for her. That‚Äôs certainly not how I feel on the inside. I mentioned these things to say that people have this perception of me that isn‚Äôt real. 

Anyway, to get to the point: I ONLY go after emotionally/unavailable men. All the men I‚Äôve been into either don‚Äôt want to be in relationships or they refuse to ever be in another relationship again because their exes ‚Äúbroke‚Äù them. And I get that I may be subconsciously gravitating towards these kinds of guys, but I don‚Äôt fully believe that to be true. The reason is that I‚Äôll meet a guy, he comes off as completely normal and even into me, we‚Äôll get along so well, and the minute I sense them starting to fall for me (and me them), they back away. So they never give off the vibe that they‚Äôre unavailable. It‚Äôs only when they develop feelings. And you know what I do? I OBSESS over them. I convince myself that I have very strong feelings for them, and I chase them. I try desperately to change their minds, to show them what an amazing woman I can be, to show them that I can love them and that my love will make them soft again. It‚Äôs like an addiction that I can‚Äôt stop. And the thing is, I have perfectly healthy, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (again, sorry if this word offends anybody) men who try to date me and take me out. And the thing is, I have ended up liking them and seeing a happy future with these guys, but the strong, intense feelings never develop. In fact, I tend to push them away by being so emotionally detached and distant. Meanwhile, I chase after men who don‚Äôt want to be in relationships. And it‚Äôs not all men like this - it‚Äôs only the ones who definitely seem very interested in me but then go on to say that they cannot allow themselves to become emotionally attached to a woman ever again who I do this with. 

I can‚Äôt take it anymore. It has completely taken over my life because I develop SUCH STRONG feelings for these guys. Even if I don‚Äôt know them well, I almost feel as if I‚Äôm in love with them even though realistically I know I can‚Äôt be. And so, as happened recently, I fell for this guy after spending about 3 weeks with him. I met him on vacation, and we had such a great time. He told me he was so glad that he met me and that things hadn‚Äôt been going well in his life lately. He was super sweet, he was romantic, he took care of me, etc. These things really drew me towards him. He thought I‚Äôd be around longer, but when I mentioned to him that I was leaving soon, his entire personality changed. He hardly talked to me and didn‚Äôt even care to tell me goodbye when I was leaving for good. I texted him later that week telling him how I felt about him, as well as how I felt about the complete 180-change. He told me that whatever went on between us ended the day I left, and he‚Äôs sorry if I felt led on but that after his relationship with his ex, he will never allow himself to become emotionally attached to me. 

I‚Äôve been so depressed ever since. I can‚Äôt get out of this funk. After he told me that, he said he still wants me in his life, and I agreed because I‚Äôd rather suffer being his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù than not. I‚Äôd text him everyday, but after realizing he wasn‚Äôt putting any effort into it, I just stopped. I texted him yesterday for the last time just to wish him luck because I knew he‚Äôd be starting his custody battle this month and I told him he has a friend in me if he ever needs anything. And that was the end of that. This is actually healthier than what I‚Äôd normally do, which is how I know I‚Äôm making tiny baby step improvements. Normally, I would have spent months and potentially years trying to make him fall in love with me. Because I‚Äôve done that before. 

I know I need therapy. I have an appointment to see my PCP so that she can refer me to a psychologist or counselor of sorts. However, I can‚Äôt help but think - even with ‚Äúhelp,‚Äù will I ALWAYS be drawn to these kinds of men? I may be able to stop the desperate chasing of these men, but what about the intense feelings that drive my actions? I feel like my father has completely and utterly ruined me (the way he treated me has affected my professional life as well). I feel like there is no saving me and that, while I can control my actions, the negative effects it has had on my mental psyche will forever remain. 

Will I ever accept the kind of love that I deserve? Or will I continue to give my all to men who, for whatever reason, cannot have it or do not want it? I feel so hopeless and so helpless. Even though I recognize this serious flaw in me, I keep making this mistake over and over and over again. 

Also, lol‚Äôing at the fact that I mentioned at the beginning of this post that it wouldn‚Äôt be a long one, but it ended up being ridiculously long. Thank you for reading all the way to the end if you did!",06Oct2019,3

56,"I grow up in a family where my parents would try to control every single thing about my life. I always thought they did it because they know what‚Äôs best for me. They wanted (forced) me to be the perfect daughter. I‚Äôm f20, i never had a night out because my parents would kill me if i did that, even i had to beg to had a sleepover at my friend‚Äôs house. But recently something happened. Something that change my perspective towards my parents. I realized they are a control freak after this.

So, i had a boyfriend. We broke up because my parents numerous times tried to hook me up with someone they knew although they are aware im dating someone and had met him twice. My boyfriend felt degraded so he left. I tried my best to let go of him but i can‚Äôt. The situation got worse after my dad called me names a few days ago.

At this moment, i just want to kill myself. Death is the only thing that cross my mind lately. I lose my boyfriend whom i really love. And i also stuck with my controlling parents. If you‚Äôre wondering why don‚Äôt i leave the house, well i can‚Äôt. My dad can tracks me wherever i am. My savings account also not enough to live by myself. To make it worse, it is very hard to live independently in my country (i live in southeast asia).

I have tried meditation, seek professional help, even religious therapy and it doesn‚Äôt help. I can only think of death. If i leave, the world is still going to continue like nothing happened. The sun is still going to shine. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúsuicide only pass the pain the others‚Äù thing. If others really care about me then why they make me feeling all the pain this whole time? Nonetheless, i am aware how selfish this is. But let me remind you, i‚Äôve been choosing others this whole time.

60,"I have dealt with depression and substance abuse for the majority of my life.   After being sober for over a year, I can't shake an overwhelming thought that invades my mind.  I get this lightheaded feeling and my peripherals blur as if I were in a dream, at which point I can't be sure whether or not I'm truly awake or in fact dreaming.  It can happen at almost any time and there doesn't seem to be a trigger.  The thought doesn't seem to go away.  Eventually I start to believe that I'm living in some kind of false reality.

I do have a doctor and psychiatrist and am on medication for depression and bipolar.  None of it seems to have an effect, and I have gone through many different adjustments with them, to no avail.

Now, here is the strange part.  The only times where I can get these episodes to stop is when I am indulging in a substance regularly.  I have started drinking again and feel more in control than I did while completely sober.  This is troubling because other areas of my life suffer when I engage in that behavior.",06Oct2019,5

I'm 14 (and no, please to categorize me as one of those Billie Eilish whatever girls who use depression as an aesthetic) and I'm not gonna self-diagnose myself with depression but I do know im fucking tired of everything. Coming from a dysfunctional family and shit, siblings and parents who don't give a fuck. My siblings who are good looking and are over achievers while I'm over here failing simple math and shit. I recently transferred to a prestigious school from a sorry excuse of a school, and I'm already fucking shit up 2 months in. Failed Math, 12 tardies (which is a big a big deal since it's such a strict school), and not to mention, I'm fucking ugly. 
Everyone keeps saying ""Oh, you're so smart"", ""Oh, you're so musically talented"" and other shit like that. But I'm not! Fucking shit it's fucking hard trying to keep up with the person they see me as. My fucking insecurities are fucking everywhere. They think I'm soooo good with the piano, with the guitar, that I can play any instrument I touch, but I'm fucking not. The start of this crying session was because I was trting to learn Flight of the Bumblebee and my right hand is being a total fucking useless piece if shit, and everything just kind of escalated for some reason. I'm fucking fat (I starve myself but then binge eat), fucking hideous (because the school I transferred, even with it being expensive as shit, doesn't have A/C resulting in pimples galore). I don't come from a rich family, we're comfortable enough to afford what we need and occasionally what we want. I'm really sorry if this is a very priviledged and entitled sounding rant. The school I'm currently going to has been my dream for so many years and when I got in, i was fucking ecstatic.

Don't know if this is the right subreddit or not, so if not let me know of course.

So basically I have noticed for a while now that often after I take a nap in the middle of the day (which I love doing) I will feel really calm and worryfree afterwards for a while (usually an hour or so maybe). Now, I have suspected that might suffer from some sort of anxiety or depression problem and have tried to look on the internet if something like this is common with people with anxiety or depression.

But the only thing I really find is people saying how much they hate naps. I was wondering if anyone here knows if this has something to do with anxiety or something similar maybe? If it has I probably start actively looking into getting some professional help since if how I feel after a nap is how I'm supposed to feel most of the time I would really like to get there.

69,"Just to clarify I'm not asking to be diagnosed over Reddit, I'm just trying to get some opinions on my situation or advice.

[17M] Over the last few years I've felt as if something isn't completely right with me. I have a hard time figuring out who I am or even what type of personality I've got because I tend to be different so often. Many times I've been told I'm really mature for my age, many times I've been told I'm childish and I've got a sense of humour of child, I've also been told I'm really dry and moody all the time but to some people I've been told I'm their favorite person to be around. 

When I feel emotions I never feel them slightly, when I'm happy I'm really happy, when I'm angry I'm over the top etc. Things that aren't important make me angry beyond belief, an example of this was when my sister's friend made a harmless comment about me that then made me so triggered and angry that I was calling her every name under the sun and then shortly after punched a hole straight through my cupboard. Which I then regreted later on because I realize how embarrassing, petty and over the top I was being but at the time I genuinely couldn't control myself.

My mother and her boyfriend were accusing me of being on drugs when I came home from work because I was so overally energetic to the point where I could be barely speak to them as I was stuttering so much. My mum has even threatened to kick me out(The only drugs I've ever done is Weed). Not long after my older brother who I hadnt seen in 2 years came over and was sitting with me when he asked me genuinely if I'm ""off my head"" because of how I was acting. I didn't even realize I was like this in both of the situations until they confronted me. 

When it comes to relationships I have had 1 intimate (barely) relationship with someone but I shut things off as I felt I was not capable of holding a relationship for a long time. Another thing I noticed when I was talking to this girl is that I would be over appreciating her and then suddenly fast forward a while I could have little to no feeling towards her whatsoever. Recently I've felt as if my family and friends are drifting away slowly, which for a while I completely turned my back on everybody. Looking back I feel like I was pretty much convincing myself this was happening when it wasn't.

I also read that an individual with BPD can tend to change their appearance often etc. But I'm the complete opposite. I haven't changed as a person whatsoever in years because I don't know who I am or what I want to do so I decide to do absolutely nothing at all and this applies to everything in my life.

When it comes to the compulsive side of things over the last few months I've began smoking weed everyday and even sending money to my friends who are over 18 to gamble money on sports for me.

I constantly feel empty and I don't know how to go through this world or day to day life because I'm so unaware of who I am. 

This is all just a few examples but I could go on and on.

I've been wanting to post about this on Reddit for a while but never had the courage so any feedback would be appreciated.",06Oct2019,1

71,"After a near suicidal experience that was caused by a severe depressive episode after years of mild depression. I went to a psychiatrist to get help and therapy.

Maybe I don't and they'll know that, and I'm just someone with normal problems not worthy of seeing a psychologist for. 

Anyway do you see the thought process happening here? Has anyone experienced this kind of regret/dread after booking their first session?",06Oct2019,9
76,"I have this feeling people around me think Im afraid of them or wont hurt them. They underestimate me cause Ive shown no action of attack or negative energy. What people dont get is Im holding back so much energy. My thoughts are deadly &amp; negative. Things I wish I could unsee in my brain... I end up smoking a lot and doing anything as a distraction. I could take action on my built up energy but Id either end up in jail, warrant out for my arrest, or end up in a psych ward. Plus Im not that strong so Id hurt myself more.

77,"To put things simply, I was a wreck just a few months ago. I was a terrible person. I was selfish, dramatic, manipulative, resentful, negative, hateful towards others who upset me, angry/volatile, you name it. When things just continued to get worse, I left my boyfriend of 2 years in July because it was affecting him so much that I was dragging him down with me. I was not abusive towards him, but I just made things very difficult. 
Shortly after, I left my volatile home environment and am now living in a different state. Since then, my life has changed so drastically that I don‚Äôt even recognize who I used to be. I am now outgoing, kind, understanding, patient, friendly, and so much more. Everything I didn‚Äôt like about my personality just, went away. It was insane how fast I saw results. However, I am so scared that I‚Äôll go back to what I used to be.
My ex and I still talk on the daily and talk about possibly getting back together in the near future, but he is afraid I‚Äôll revert back and so am I. 
They say a new habit can take two months to form, on average. This feels like more than just ‚Äúhabits‚Äù, it feels like an entire shift in my personality and character. How can I know that I‚Äôve changed for good and it won‚Äôt revert if I go back home or get back in the safety of a relationship?",06Oct2019,1
78,"I‚Äôm really nervous. Mostly cause I‚Äôm scared that nothing is actually wrong with me, but that I actually just suck at being a person. The only thing that pushes that thought away, is the fact that my anxiety and depression seem to be more ‚Äúapparent‚Äù than usual. I have been able to be high-functioning, which is often why I feel like nothing is wrong with me. Also, when I go to the doctor I feel like I‚Äôm in sort of mania. I‚Äôm happy around those times. I think it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm one step closer to being better. I‚Äôm on 350 Wellbutrin right now, but it hasn‚Äôt done much for me.

79,"I'm male, mid 20's and live in the US if any of that matters. I had originally written out a really long detailed post but then i accidentally deleted it and I can't be bothered to type it all back out. 

I feel awful and I have for as long as I can remember. I hate myself. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Doing anything is a struggle.  I have no friends. I used to have friends, but they either left me or I cut myself off from them. I don't talk to people often, and when I do I hate it. Talking to people is the worst and is guaranteed to make me feel even more awful about myself. I'm up to three days without talking to anyone right now. I love being alone. I hate being alone.

I have panic attacks at work. I can't get rid of this constant feeling that everyone is suddenly going to realize what a useless fraud I am and what's left of my life will come crashing down on me. Some nights I can't sleep and feel like garbage. Some nights I sleep 10 hours and feel like garbage. My body disgusts me. I barely eat most days. When I run out of food I just go without eating because leaving my house is too hard. Half the time when I look in the mirror I don't recognize myself. 

I've almost killed myself twice, but both times I was too scared to actually go through with it. If I lose my job I think I might actually do it though. I'm constantly afraid it's going to happen, every time my boss so much as looks at me i think ""this is it."" I wish somebody else would kill me so I don't have to think about it. I don't want the responsibility. I settle for hitting myself instead. I mostly go for my legs because I know nobody will see if it bruises, but sometimes I go for my face because that just feels better. 

I don't really care anymore. I'm so apathetic towards everything. I just want it all to stop. This has been going on for years, and I have tried very hard not to let anyone know. I haven't seen a doctor in at least 5 years, maybe more. I've been collecting physical health problems too. I just don't care enough. I just want to get off this ride. I hate myself. How is it possible that I can keep expecting myself to fail and still be disappointed when it happens?

I hate this. I hate me. I hate everything. I don't care. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't think I was meant for this world. I have my first appointment with my PCP since forever in a month. I don't want to go but I have to for work. Should I say something when I go? I don't want to. I don't want to talk to anyone. I just want it to stop. I'm so tired. I'm sorry",06Oct2019,2

The other day she told me about being under stress because of an assignment and trying to cry for the sake of venting things out, but she couldn't make herself cry as hard as she tried to. 

She's told me that I've helped but I feel like I haven't helped enough. I feel useless because I've been exactly where she is and was able to get out of it, but now that I'm not in that same position I can't figure out how I even got myself out of it or how to apply the same solutions to her life.

She's my best friend and I want more than anything for her to be in a place where she wants to be because as great of a person as she is, she deserves to be happy more than anyone else.

84,"I'm (25F) going through a real depressive spell currently, I'm going to therapy and I take my meds but theres still a lot to deal with.  Last year my partner of 6 years broke up with me and even though its been +9 months I'm still not over it and they've moved on.

After a mental health epiphany, I traced a link to when my parents separated and I went from seeing my dad all the time to never seeing him for a few years, which is identical to the break up. 

I know break ups are supposed to hurt but I feel like this is lingering too long. Having linked it to possible separation anxiety, I tried looking for tips on how to deal with. But most of the results are for small children or dogs :i  &amp; all the adult ones essentially boiled down to see a therapist and get some meds and I'd like to have some things I can do to help myself, since I have to get over this break up and be able to go back into a relationship (if i can deal with dating, which is a whole diffrerent anxiety thing by itself) and be able to protect/help myself from this.

I‚Äôd feel paralyzed and just couldn‚Äôt get myself to focus on it. Over the summer I saw a neurologist and did some testing for ADHD (MRI, EEG, and a computer test). I was told the MRI and EEG results came back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and that the computer test said it was only possible that I had ADHD. Before these tests I did a lot of research about ADHD after my therapist at school pointed out how much I talked about my lack of ability to focus and asked whether I had considered medication. I really thought I had found out what was going on with my brain, it all made sense. I was supposed to go for more testing but I was too anxious to make the phone call so I still haven‚Äôt gone. Honestly I‚Äôve kinda lost hope at this point but I still feel shitty and can‚Äôt get my homework done and it feels like I‚Äôm always fighting off a bad mood using temporary distractions. I‚Äôm afraid to be alone. The neurologist said I might just have anxiety or depression but I‚Äôve been struggling with starting/finishing tasks for as long as I can remember but I don‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve been depressed much earlier than high school. It seemed like the neurologist was hesitant to believe it was ADHD bc I got good grades in high school but I know that the way I dealt with homework and procrastination was worse than my classmates. I just don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm tired of feeling bad all the time. I feel like this post is so disorganized but I guess my whole point is that I‚Äôm very sure I have executive functioning issues but idk what they‚Äôre being caused by and it‚Äôs frustrating bc I can‚Äôt get out of bed or feed myself or study or do homework. I feel like I physically can‚Äôt move I‚Äôm just sitting here begging myself to get up and eat bc I haven‚Äôt had a meal in almost two days now but the thought of cooking anything, even something small is so overwhelming to me.",06Oct2019,5

Just wondering what you guys do on a day to day basis to keep yourself going. Life‚Äôs getting tough, I have a history of depression and my mood has been down for quite a while now. 

Anything would help :)",06Oct2019,2
111,"All my life I have felt off. I've always been way to aware of everything. It's horrible and I have never really been able to let loose and be crazy because of it. While I do feel the ways listed below I am very level headed and know how to be a normal person at the same time. Here are some issues I have:

1. I have friends, about 5 really close ones, and I am in a long term serious relationship. Despite this I have always found it really hard to make friends or to really connect with people and notice that people around me make connections way easier than I do and more often as well. I often feel like everyone is against me and everyone is always making fun of me. its not as bad now that i have the slight ""no one matters"" mind set, but this was overwhelming in high school to the point that I isolated myself for two years and didnt do anything social except attend school. 
2. I don't talk a lot but my mind is CONSTANTLY talking. It's always going and I realize I should be saying this stuff out loud but I never do. Often I even reply in my mind to people and don't even realize I didn't say anything. Random example: sitting in the car with my mom and it's dead silent, I will be having entire conversations in my end and saying random thoughts but never once saying them out loud. 
3. I have insane mood swings and can be a very angry person when set off. My anger wants to lead to violence but I have never hurt anyone and never will. Its more like I want to punch a wall or hit a tree with a baseball bat to get the anger out. My moods switch VERY fast in either direction: going from very angry to in a good mood, or in a good mood to depressed. 
4. I have had existential panic attacks since the age of 4. I have always been aware that I will die and that life can be viewed as very very meaningless. That nothing really matters in the grand scheme of things. This thought pattern can and has gotten me in trouble. 
5. I have been an atheist as long as I can remember. I went to a private christian school until I was 7 and absolutely hated it. I often got in trouble starting in just kindergarten for trying to challenge the teacher about jesus being real. 
6. I have always been ahead of people my own age. As listed above, my thoughts on religion were very advanced for my age and almost non heard of (claimed my principle during a meeting with my parents once.) My reading level was very advance as well and I set the record for my school that is still held. In 2nd grade I was reading at an 9th grade level, and in 4th grade I could read books required in 12th grade and pass the tests that were given on them. I still read like crazy to this day and even work at a private owned book store. 
7. I have always been interested in dark things. True crime stories, horror genre EVERYTHING and so on. At 5 years old I found my grandmothers dvd of Carrie and watched it alone. I used to pick out horror movies in elementary school to watch, I had an addiction to reading creepypastas in middle/high school, watching all horror movies, reading all true murder stories and creepy things I could find online, even attempting to go on the dark web to find even scarier stuff. I never did this because I watched a video that persuaded me not to go on there. To this day I am still obsessed and I listen to true crime podcasts constantly every day. 

there may be nothing wrong with me and I'm just weird like everyone is. Im aware that everyone has gross, weird and disturbing things about them that a strangers eye wouldn't see. I have always felt off tho and I feel like I always will. I was on adderall for a while in high school and it helped me be more outgoing but it made me more depressed so I got off it bc mom was afraid i would commit suicide.",06Oct2019,1
112,"(Sry for bad english) So I am having a little bit of trouble with my school and my parents. My grades aren't really good at school and I don't really have much motivation to learn stuff.

113,"It's not so serious so let me explain. Some time ago I started a daily routine where I have to come up with some things that make me happy and grateful about my life, you know, like some sort of coping mechanism. But recently a thought popped into my mind, ""If I can't take it anymore, I can easily end my it all, afterall it's my life and it's my decision to make."" Of course, I know how it will affect a few people around that still care for me. But I find it strangely comforting that all my troubles can be dealt with so fast and easy.

115,"So for the past 8 or so months even slight inconveniences have the potential to just completely set me off. The other day I believe I had a full blown panic attack over something so meaningless. A girl who I was working on a project with was upset with me because I was doing another classes homework. This girl who by the way is a good friend of mine asked me politely to work on the project. For some reason my brain took that information and made my mind spiral out of control. I thought I‚Äôd fail the class, I thought she wasn‚Äôt my friend anymore and I was visibly freaking out and yelling to the point I had to call my mom to pick me up. It‚Äôs embarrassing to tell someone you had to leave school because you were angry/having a panic attack. One thing I‚Äôve noticed is that the severe severe panic attacks (basically can‚Äôt breathe, entire body going into panic mode, muscles clench, thoughts racing) only started after a single extremely traumatic event. Has anyone else on here had a singular traumatic experience that lead to them having repeat panic episodes? I created this account just to post this because it‚Äôs ruining my life. I‚Äôm having panic attacks (light or terrible) nearly every other day and it‚Äôs destroying me mentally.

I'm in a career I despise in a house in a town I dislike, the only good thing I have is my family that I can't help but push away.

People say do what you love or do what your good at, but I feel like I'm not good at anything. I try new things and give in after a week and that adds to my feeling of being a failure.

I never try to hurt anyone on purpose, but it does happen occasionally (I mean hurt someone‚Äôs feelings not physically hurting them).

123,"I'm not sure I know how to explain this well but I'm going to try.

I'm dealing with a mixture of problems of my own which have been around for years including anxiety and OCD which have recently been massively increased following a LOT of deaths in my family over the course of a year and have been struggling to cope already - I am waiting to start therapy but as I can't afford private care I'm on a wait list.

Around a year ago I hired a new member of staff at work who sits right opposite me and it has come to light over this past year that they have some serious mental health issues of their own and I am finding it increasingly difficult to deal with. They constantly ask me for advice during work (which they never ever take) and tell me awful, awful stories about their home life which make me miserable but their own issues are preventing them from getting out of the situation.

Realistically I can do nothing to help them. They won't let me. I don't feel like I can cope any more mentally with their added problems on top of my own but the last family member of mine who passed away was due to suicide and I am plagued with the feeling of not being able to abandon anybody in their hour of need and wanting to be there for everybody however I can.

I don't know what is going to happen if it continues and I wondered if any of you have had to deal with a similar problem of having to decide to put your own mental health before somebody elses.",06Oct2019,1

I was stupid to think I could handle all that without seeking any help. It has basically ruined my marriage. My wife barely talks to me because of my blow ups I've had in the past.


Today I woke up and told myself I was taking my life back. I hiked up a local mountain today in santa rosa ca to prove to myself I could. It felt so freeing to know something that I've always wanted to do is now done. Tomorrow I call a psychiatrist to set up a meeting. 

For the sake of my, and my wifes marriage I will do this. Even if she does end up leaving, I need to do this for me.

125,"...and because I don‚Äôt speak to her, she naturally assumes that I‚Äôm okay. She doesn‚Äôt know that I suffer with depression, I tend to keep it to myself until she‚Äôs asleep and then I break down, I try not to hurt myself. Usually I just write how I‚Äôm feeling in a book and this distracts me but the last couple of times I did that, the urge was there to drag the pen along my skin instead of on the paper and it‚Äôs getting harder to resist. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to. I‚Äôve always kept myself to myself so I don‚Äôt have friends to speak to, my family don‚Äôt speak to me anymore and I don‚Äôt confide in those people that say their there for you because they‚Äôre not. No one ever asks me if I‚Äôm okay, no one ever texts me unless they want to borrow money and it just makes me feel worthless, like no one cares. And these past few days, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I don‚Äôt want to be here. Usually I go to sleep and the next day I‚Äôll be fine but it‚Äôs been 3 days so far that I‚Äôve been feeling like this. Just to clarify, by not wanting to be here, I don‚Äôt mean die, I just mean here, in life in general. Like I‚Äôve had no control in the direction that my life has gone, i just wanna be somewhere else, anywhere else. And I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice on how to feel better? I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt really wanna talk to other people about it because I feel worthless and don‚Äôt want to unload my problems onto them when they have better things to do. Also the thought that they probably won‚Äôt care anyway, they‚Äôll just try to make it seem like they do so they don‚Äôt look selfish or like a c*nt. I feel like I might break down again soon, maybe it‚Äôs what I need right now but I don‚Äôt know what to write in my book anymore, I‚Äôve wrote so much in there that it‚Äôll just look like I‚Äôm repeating myself. But also I‚Äôm kinda scared to break down because last time, I did feel like dying, and I was just trying to cling onto any reason to keep fighting but it‚Äôs hard not to give up on yourself when everyone else has. And I kind of feel like deleting all this because I‚Äôm probably just wasting people‚Äôs time.

130,"Just curious. Maybe this is more just an NPD thing, and not sociopathy, but do sociopaths do this? I mean, the person I've been with has been nothing but abusive. He gaslights, cheats, physically/mentally/emotionally abuses, gets off on being sadistic (with his equally sadistic harem of sociopaths), etc., yet he keeps claiming I love him when I clearly do NOT nor have I ever with my hindsight now being 20/20. At this point, I don't even like him. At least before I kind of liked him. Now I'm just thankful that I haven't let me touch me/sleep with me for 5 months (I suspect one time at the end of 2017 he gave me an STD after some bizarre threesome his one ""ex"" anonymously hinted at via some texts, but instead of admitting he may have passed something on to me, he gaslighted me into believe I just got ""the flu"".)

Anyway, life has been nothing but miserable the past 5 years with this guy, and if I could move out ASAP, I would. But, sadly, that's another story. However I just wanted to see if those of you who have been diagnosed as sociopaths admit to this tactic. I mean, do you really believe people love you when they clearly do not, or do you just do it to mess with the other person's head and you know they don't love you?",06Oct2019,1

134,"Throwaway account because people know of my main one.

I'm a college student right now and I've been so overwhelmed recently. I'm a junior taking 16 credits this semester, don't even have my major declared yet, work 40 hours a week and I still feel like I'm not doing as much as I should. I never even have free time anymore because it's all focused around school and work, and whenever I do get free time to enjoy myself I feel guilty that I'm not studying, doing homework or picking up an extra shift. Im getting an average of 4 hours of sleep a night, and I overwork myself to the point that the thought of waking up and going through my daily schedule sickens me.

My physical health is quickly deteriorating and it's only a matter of time before I end up in a hostpital, but I dont see any other option that would work out for me. I'm losing weight, constantly feel ill, which results in me struggling to make it through every single day.

Recently, I've started feeling like giving up. Deep down I know I can do it, but something in me tells me that everything will go wrong and that I don't have my life figured out as much as I should at this point. I feel like I'm stuck and it will always be like this for me no matter what I do to try to get myself out of it.

136,"I know you have to be healthy to attract a healthy partner, but honestly... does anyone really believe healthy relationships exist?  Isn't everyone pretty much just messed up, but on varying degrees of the spectrum?  I am considered ""old"" now for a female in the dating arena... just turned 40 this year.  I feel like a real, healthy relationship is just a pipe dream. And that's fine. We all can't have what we want in life just because we want it.  

I remember when I was in my teens all I wanted was to find a best friend.  I did.  He turned out to be my first boyfriend.  I really liked him, and the feeling was mutual.  But then drama struck and my NPD mom ruined that for me. Then in my 20's I married someone who was like my mother but gender-flipped and on the darker side of the NPD abuse.  Then all I wanted in my 20's was someone to actually desire me and want to be with me and find me as beautiful as I knew I was deep down inside, instead of treating me like I was his mother and constantly putting me down and giving me extreme anxiety.  Then in my 30's after I finally broke down from the horrible abusive marriage and got my divorce, all I wanted was to find some stable work relationships because my nervous system was shot from the stress from my childhood and from my 20's.  And, of course, being so on edge, that added to my workplace issues and I had a very hard time trusting anyone I worked with from all of the PTSD.  Now starting my 40's, I feel like I'm just giving up on all relationships (due to the current man I'm trying to run far, far away from), and want to go hide in a cave until the apocalypse comes, which at that point I'll hopefully find a nice zombie friend, and then my 50's will revolve around trying to recover from the undead abusiveness and isolation.  And don't even get me started when I do finally die... I'm sure the afterlife is probably just as torturous, it's just a matter of whether or not beings with angel wings or bat wings are harassing you this time. 

I know, I know, a lot of this has to do with me and my own outlook on the world, yadda yadda.  I've been isolated most of my life and I think when I do venture out to make an effort at relationships, I tend to be attracted to those who remind me of my dysfunctional parents, then the toxic cycle ensues.  I know on some level these relationships are all just mirroring my own issues or things I've never healed, yadda yadda, but still... do healthy relationships exist?  Are there couples out there who are actually honest with one another, and kind, and supportive, and mutually attracted to one another, and enjoy spending time with one another, and can't imagine living life without the other person but in a non-attached, healthy manner?  Mind you, this has to be mutual.  I don't want any one-sided, delusional anecdotal evidence.  

So let me know.  Sound off below.  Is this all just some hoax and loving relationships really don't exist?  Do they only exist in the ""honeymoon stage?""  If so, that means healthy relationships are just a farce then.  And define what you feel is a healthy relationship.  I'm curious as to what people think.",06Oct2019,5
137,"TL;DR - My girlfriends parents won‚Äôt let me see her as they‚Äôre extremely strict and it‚Äôs messing with my mental health.

First of all me and my girlfriend are only 15, which seems to be the root of all of our problems, and we have been together for 11 months now and we‚Äôve only seen each other 4 times outside of school. 

I think I should start with saying I have a history of bad mental health, cutting myself etc. This was before I knew my girlfriend and my friends were very shitty people. She is half the reason I was so much better then I used to be before I met her. I haven‚Äôt cut myself since before we started dating and never have thought about killing myself, only wishing it would happen.

I think what made my health so much worse was when she was allowed round. I thought we were actually making progress with her parents. Just to find out in the car home her parents told her she‚Äôs not allowed to see me again. This was when I wanted to start cutting myself again and the first time I ever thought of killing myself. I never will, no matter how much I wanted to, I‚Äôm way to much of a pussy for that.

139,"TODAY, 06 OCTOBER 2019 AT 13h33 LOCAL TIME, I FINALLY UNDESRSTOOD WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME ... 

I'm 26 Male, and :

* I had a difficult teen period (late primary school , in middle shcool and high school) having constantly issues with class mates.
* I constantly had (and i'm still having) communication issues with my parents (80% with dad and 20% with mom) since primary school
* After going to the university, I noticed that something was wrong, and the constant feeling of mental pain wasn't something ordinary.
* while being a student, I've had the a chance to find a person, and we dated for several months, was the first time I ""loved"" somebody and it felt amazing, unfortunately we couldn't stay together and we broke up, and it was painful for me...
* And now being an employee with a salary income, as I entered the adulthood for about 1 year and a half, wasn't prepared for such a change, from being ""a student and do volunteering work"" to becoming an ""adult""

&amp;#x200B;

As I went to the University, I started to invest into my mental health by reading books about psychology, watching videos on YouTube about self development, tried periodicaly reflect in depth about my life, tried all sort of possible ways in order to ""understand what's wrong""  


And finally, today, I realized what was going on :  


&gt;**It's my dad's fault all along these hard years**

&amp;#x200B;

My father's story:

* My dad was raised in a poor family, having 1 brother and 6 other sisters ( there were also other siblings that died after birth unfortunately)
* Being poor, gave the children of the familly the willpower to study well, in order to get a job and start making money in order to satisfy the desires they lacked when they were young.
* My father had ( and still has ) a mindset, where he quote it in a phrase like :

&gt;Your worth, is based on how much you earn...

I've understood what he meant, considering his background back where he was a child. My father strived (and still strive) to make money, and invest it into buying food and goods for us, And **I really, really appreciate** his ""material and financial"" investment in us.

Thus, being money ,food and goods oriented, he completely lacked understanding in a life axis called "" the mental "".

After several years of, me, researching about mental health and personal development :

* Starting from school days where I had issues with classmates
* Meanwhile, got beaten up mentally by my dad - because he couldn't and still can't understand the existence of a second ""the mental"" axis of life
* Surviving until the University ( and yes because I had suicidal thoughts ), where I finally realized that my mental health was deformed throught several years. So I started my quest into understanding and trying to fix my mental issues ( later on, after 2 to 3 years, I've decided that  : **becoming morraly, mentally and emotionally stronger - is my life's vision** )
* While being a student, I had the chance to - first of it's kind - ""love"" a person, dated her for 11 months, I can proudly say that the first 5 months were ( and still I guess ) the best period I've experienced in my entire life so far, I felt alive,and felt being loved-back, I felt also that I was overflooded with energy ( love energy I guess ) and believed at that point that *life is worth to be lived* ... unfortunately, from month 5 to 11 things started to mess up, and we ended up braking up (breaking up with somebody you've experienced - for the first time - real love with, isn't easy at all ... ). That experience made me question romantic relationships, and created in me a huge self-doubt when it comes to relationships...
* After graduating, I had also a hard times because I was jobless and I've got a lot of pressure from my parents
* Arriving to this last year where I could finally get a job, and surprisingly my parents (kind of) left me alone mentally ( because I finally became useful by starting to gain money, according to them )
* Having this last full year of (kind of) peace of mind, I invested intensively into improving my mental health and personal development.

Until today,  
I've finally dug enough,  
I've finally saw the light throught the fog,  
I've found the exit from the maze where I was stuck for so long !  
and came to **colnclusion that : the source of all my troubles, was my dad's fault.**  


I finally realized that, during the past years, and with a lot of research in the field of psychology and mental health, that I was experiencing ""manipulative acts"" from my dad, as I assume that it's his educative way to raise me.

  
I'm going to go throught some of the acts and behaviors, I judge, were ""manipulative"" that I've undergone :

* Assuming that a fulfilling life consists of 2 main axis which are : 

1. the material and financial axis
2. the mental axis

* for a scale from 1 to 10, a fulfilling life (based on these two axis, where none of them can be neglected ), is about 8/10 9/10 and ideally 10/10
* Living in an environment materially and financially fulfilled, but not mentally fulfilled, makes you rate it 4/10 5/10 or 6/10, this implies that you are going to complain about the environment (because you are a child and you rely 100% percent on parents) in order to make the environment better (8/10 minimum), so when confronting to a parent who doesn't believe in the mental part, will surely not understand and acusses you of being needy, but worst of all, he's going to threaten you buy degrading the material and financial parts, to make you live in a 2/10 or 3/10 environment, to make you suffer and make you understand that (it's better for you to live in 5/10 environment and being grateful, rather than in a 2/10 environment) 
* Beat you up mentally by enrolling you into fake problems, and make it difficult for you to concentrate on real ones, this will imply you to not be as effective in life and constantly being late in your ""life living"", and ... **accusing YOU for your fails and ineffectiveness,** that you are the one and the only responsible for creating fake problems and being stuck in them while others (and yes, my parents often used to compare me with others that are progressing in life). The bottom line here is to beat you up mentally and accuse you of being **THE** responsible ( by the way I recently went throught a paragraph in a book called \[10 strategies for mass manipulation by Noam Chomsky\] and guess what was one of the strategies ? 

&gt;... Another strategy of mass manipulation is to make people believe that they are solely responsible for their problems ...

I was shocked when I read that strategy, as I concluded it by my self earlier and that I wrote it down in my journal.

* Another manipulative way ( somehow similar to the first one ) is to control you materialy and financialy when there are desagreements, a lot of conflicts had ended up with my parents banning me to take the car, or to have money, or to have acces to to the PC, or to the internet connexion or to go out somewhere with my friends... etc, even if these material and financial ressources weren't directly linked to the original conflict.
* Another one, beat you up mentally sooooo bad, that's going to break many  of your personality traits, for instance, make you lose the ability to ""argue /repost"" by constantly controlling you, this is going to affect you in interpersonal communication with others, so anytime you got confronted to somebody outside, you are more likely to loose the argument and surender, even if you are right, because you feel broken and don't know what is it about to ""win an argument when you are right""
* Comparing , or deny comparison of a parent with you , **when it suits him** 
   * comaprison example : the parent says : look how I'm doing X and Y and i'm responsible, and not you, being lazy and not responsible, you should take me and what I do as an example
   * deny comparison example : the parent says : oh, you are little with no experience, I'm older than you, i have more experience, you can't  compare yourself to me
* constantly asking to do things, to become this and that, and often it happens that the parents ask me ""to be and to not be at the same time"" , for instance :
   * mom saw me a bit overweighted (then she says to me : you should train)
   * mom speaks with her friend about an immigration plan ( she says : you should search and apply for an immigration procedure)
   * mom talks with another friend about work ( she says :  you should apply for a new better job that pays Z amount)
   * just few days ago a residential plan in order to acquire a basement came out in the country ( where you pay each period a partial amount of money) and in the conditions to apply, the applicant should have a salary between X and Y amount ( my dad says : since you are between X and Y you should apply) 
   * and many others ... it's too much demands, over my capacity, the worst is that there are conflicting demands ! ... that i'm supposed to fulfill all of them right now ... so irritating ... and capable of making me collapse
* I'm sure I experienced other manipulative acts, but unfortunately I can't remember them all :/

I'm sure that my parents are very likely not conciouss about these actions and the bad consequences that hit my mental health ( I want to believe that it's the case, and not the done consciously)

Of course I tried to talk to them and make them aware about the mental axis in the life and its importance, but senior's mindset is hard or even impossible to change

I don't want to say it, but I think that my parents just don't know what they were ( and are ) doing, they are just following the flow, act and make decisions on the spot without enough reflection ... 

Back to the topic, Like I said, my father influenced me a lot in my childhood, teenage years and still influences me right now, those bad experiences made my personalty weak, which is unfortunately not optimized mentally ( I suffer from overthinking, lack of self-esteem, self-confidence and self-doubt when dealing with people or romantic relationships, I used to have suicidal thoughts, i find it hard being in the present (in the moment) and I often day dream (visualizing past events or thinking a lot about the future)

Because of the mental suffering I'm experiencing, I believe that *Life is not worth living*, but *I* want to be wrong on this so bad ...

I hope that in the near future, i can afford to live in a separate basement, where I no longer experience being mentally bullied for things out of my control.

143,"I have been having an issue for as long as I can remember with scheduled activities. If I have something to do at a certain time, I feel crushed under the weight of it until the time comes for me to act on it. I‚Äôll use today as an example. I was off today, but my little brother needed me to take him and his friends somewhere at 4. I got furious. It was 11:42, and I felt that the four hours and eighteen minutes until I had to this was stolen from me. I tried pawning it off on my other brother and my mom but they all were incapable of doing it. I suggest he cancel, insist on it even, but I am guilt tripped by both my mom and brother. I lay in my bed, steaming, and just watch time roll by. 12:27, 1:10, 2:18, 2:48. I literally do not and can not get up from my bed. I can‚Äôt focus on anything except this small inconvenience. Even when I tell myself it‚Äôs no big deal, that it‚Äôs just a tiny blip on my day, I can‚Äôt escape it‚Äôs shadow as it towers over me. I do this with everything. If I have to work at a certain time, I‚Äôm immobile and mentally checked out until I have to start getting ready. It happens even with things I want to do like going out somewhere with my girl or my birthday dinner. Sure, I‚Äôm not always upset about it, but I am still stagnant until the time has come for whatever is going on.

144,"i feel like I'm three people. it might seem weird but it feels as if my brain is kinda divided into three parts. 

the first one is the teachers pet, who lies so that people like her. she is also very manipulating and has a high self esteem(or at least makes others believe she does). she thinks she's popular but everyone hates her.

the second one is almost goth, she has very low self-esteem and doesn't trust anyone or anything, not even herself. she doesn't talk much but is always getting into flights with the first one. she's always alone.

the third one is in the back of my head. she's more neutral, she's more me. although for some reason I never seem to let her out. she has okay self esteem I think, she's quiet, has a pretty okay sense of humour and is a hopeless romantic. she's very shy and doesn't let anyone see her ""wild side"". her wild side is just when she gets more comfortable around you and starts caring less if she's behaving politely I guess.

these three have always been in my head. I know them very well and they always argue. well the first two ones. they always have their opinion. it's very loud in my head and it's hard to concentrate.

145,"I'm a 23 male and I started thinking that maybe my mind is not so healthy. English is not my native language so for the long time I didn't know exact translation for word ""anxiety"". But when I finally realised what does it mean everything kinda changed. The thing is that most of the time I worry and imagine bad things out of nowhere. I thought that all people have this. For example, if my mom calls me from shop and says she will be back in 10 minutes but after 10 minutes she is not home, my mind starts creating car accident scenarios. Don't get me wrong, I'm kinda chill guy and usually I don't care about a lot of things, but maybe I'm just trying to hide it. And I think I know when everything started. My father was alcohol addicted when I was child and teen. When I was 16 I found him laying on the floor half dead. He tried to kill himself while I was at home. After that time, he was still drinking for like a year maybe. I talked with him a lot about this, but he was blaming us. One time I hit him twice when he was drunk again. After that he changed. He went rehab and how is like 5 years sober. Could it be that after what he did I got like a trauma or something that is fucking up my minds now? In the past he had big anger problems but after rehab he is much much calmer. But sometimes I feel like him. Sometimes I got this anger inside me that is driving me crazy. I'm trying to be positive person and I laugh a lot with my friends, but I think it's one of my masks. I get used to hide all my feelings. But I can't hide it from myself. Sometimes Usually I imagine bad things in my head without a reason. Then I catch myself thinking about bad bullshit and try to calm myself. I'm not suicidal or something, I think I'm happy because I have good family and good friends, just I'm afraid if I will not fix my minds it could get worse. I don't know if any of this makes sense because I'm not used to share my emotions but maybe someone was experiencing similar things and can look at this from different perspective and say if my head is good or not.

148,"Soo, i was just looking up what a psychopath is, and what a sociopath is, and its worrying me. 

I sometimes lie and do other things when normal people might not? Im not sure what normal people would do, but i would lie about a lot of things to try to make things better? Sayibg i was sick to get out of school, saying i wanted to be healthy when getting confronted by other things , etc, and some of the lies were bad, but when i think back im not a fan of that, and im trying to sort it out. 

Like when im with my friends i often come off as emotionless, but i see myself as more of a, i feel what other people feel, like when im with happy people I'm typically happier, and when everyones quiet i cant think of anythibg to say, and get dry mouth. 

I really do feel joy and happiness with my friends, but in normal life its not as present, but its still there, i also can be really manipulative, but i really hate that part of me and im actually fighting against it. 

Is it possible i have schitzophrenia and just cant hear the other voice, but it makes choices? Because morally i disagree with alot of my actions. 

Im also 99% sure i have ADHD im going to a professional to get diagnosed soon, 

Im 17, male. Like i really do love my friends but sometimes when im with them i become emotionless sometimes and just dont do much if we're just chilling, i really do want to change, im actively fighting against it, ive always been shy, 

I think im a sociopath with ADHD, 

But i still care about people, and i really want to be social, i only have work friends, but im good friends with everyone, and i really like that. I want to be more social and have more friends, i want people that i can care about and enjoy to be with, does anyone know what i might have? Im going to fight this regardless, my friends mean so much to me and if that means i have to fight myself i will,

150,"I ask because I look at the guy I'm trying to run away from now and his not-so-secret, not-so-ex lovers, and they obviously display signs of sociopathy and even psychopathy.  My question is, can two people who fall under these personality disorders actually have a loving, healthy relationship?  

Part of me thinks it's like two peas in a pod: they are made for one another, so it works for them.  They feed off of one another's narcissism and arrogance, and it riles up the passion and excitement that they constant are in search for/seek out via their manipulations and abuse of others.  However, that obviously doesn't make it a classically ""healthy"" relationship... but... in their ""dimension"" together, I guess it's as healthy and ""real"" as it will ever be, considering their lack of true empathy.

And what about if they have children together?  Will that kid ever stand a chance?  Part of me suspects everyone and their mother knows that the guy I'm with impregnated his ""ex"" last year and they have a kid together now, but everyone keeps their lips sealed about it.  Anyway, maybe, maybe not.  Or maybe he's gaslighted me so much into a state of paranoia that that's what he wants me to think.  Irrespective of that issue, seriously, what would happen to a child raised by such cold, vicious human beings?  Do they even stand a chance at developing some sort of true compassion/empathy as they grow throughout their years?  It's scary to ponder, really.

Anyway, back to the topic of just the partnership, I ask because, like most people who ponder ""why is s/he happy with [so-and-so] when they were so cruel to me,"" I want to know if that's the case as well.  I can't fathom that these two abusive individuals are actually happy.  How can they be honestly happy and living a healthy relationship when they've treated me like I was some unwitting victim of some S&amp;M torture play?  I mean, is happiness just relative?  Can beings be happy by being malicious vampires, sucking the life energy out of those less unsuspecting and powerless?  Or do you think that, deep down, they are just as miserable?",06Oct2019,1

153,"I‚Äôve been feeling quite angry about this lately so i thought i‚Äôd rant about this here. 

This story includes me (obviously) my mother, whom also suffers with depression, and my sister (no mental illness)

I grew up with severe depression and anxiety, my mother told me as i grew up that she saw it manifesting as early as 6 years old. Due to this i have NEVER really known who i am, i never developed hobbies or passions that would stick with me through life like my brother and sisters. 

Fast forward to age 12 this was the first time my mom took me to the doctor about my MH. The doctors told her i was too young, theres nothing they can possibly do even though i expressed thoughts of suicide. My mom kept taking me back and eventually i saw a proper MH nurse at the hospital, she set up a date for me to see a shrink and all was well until that day. (it didn‚Äôt go well but that a story for another time) 

SO to the actual story, my childhood depression explained so on so forth. I am 19 now almost 20, so definitely in the ‚Äúmost of my life‚Äù range for my MI. My sister has been telling me lately that i need to start doing things, and helping around the house (which i definitely already do) and to stop using my MH as a crutch for not doing anything. 

My mother has never been anything but supportive of me and doesn‚Äôt push me to do things that i physically and mentally cannot do. She allowed me to drop out of college because it wasn‚Äôt working, she gave me a job at her company so that i could put my writing skills to good use and get paid. 

She has told me so many times that I, and I quote ‚Äúhave nothing to stress about you don‚Äôt have a job, you don‚Äôt go to college, you don‚Äôt do anything‚Äù so apparently i cannot feel stress when i do nothing basically. I try to explain to her all the time how just choosing to get out if bed in the morning is difficult because i have to face the world and thats hard for me, she doesn‚Äôt get it. I try to explain my constant tiredness and all i get is ‚Äúyou sleep for at least 11 hours how are you tired?‚Äù 

I am used to this now, however, what i am not used too is being told that i have changed as a person. I have grown up, i‚Äôm not a child anymore of course i‚Äôve changed. But i know that she means my behaviours and opinions and how i like things doing have changed, and yes, they change a lot, but im finally getting better so i‚Äôm trying to figure out what works for me. My mother has always taught me that if i have an issue i need to speak up, but my sister never listens to me. 

i change a lot. 

i change what i like, what i hate, my opinions, my thoughts a lot. 

I am trying to figure out who i am after 14 years of not knowing. 

I am trying to be me, but i don‚Äôt know who that is yet. 

I wish that she could understand this, but she never listens to me or tries to understand. My mother tries to explain but she doesn‚Äôt get it. 

I just need her to know that i am trying my best and i will be me soon...even if she doesn‚Äôt know who the person i turn out to be is.

160,"So, I require some mental health tips on living with my abuser.  Before anyone starts to proclaim, ""Why don't you just move out?"", yes, I am working on it.  Therefore, we can leave that out of the discussion for now.  In the meantime, as I get my life together and figure out my exit plan in a sensible, safe manner, I need tips.  Tips that would help me avoid unrelenting psycho I live with who doesn't seem to get the message that, 

A) I am not his ""wife.""
We were never married, even though, when it suits him, he likes to tell people we are... other times he acts like I'm just his business partner, or girlfriend, or some pathetic woman he looks after because no one else will, etc.

B) I do not want to talk to him.
Even though I try my best to ignore him-- especially after his episodes of rage, when he tries to talk to me like everything is now fine and nothing ever happened-- he still insists on initiating conversation.  Wouldn't be so difficult if he were sane and understood that you don't get to violently yell at someone, break down their door, threaten them, tell them to leave, and think that's an okay thing to do.  By the way, he did this the other week because I decided to rearrange my bedroom furniture (i.e. I haven't slept with him for 5 months and he sleeps in the room opposite of me, most likely keeping his newly, happily unemployed ""ex"" lover company all day long via long distance communication, which of course is what she's wanted all along ever since we started dating 5 years ago...).  I mean... and then he acts like everything is okay and offers me pizza, which he knows makes me sick.  

C) I don't want to interact with him, even though we live together.
As already stated, we live in a rancher that is very small and, because he's a hoarder (yes, he's a prize, ain't he?), I literally have nowhere else to go except my small room... which hasn't had a lock on it for quite some time now because HE KEEPS BREAKING IT DOWN when he gets into one of his rages.  I believe the other week makes it the 4th time he's done this.  I'm tired of having to move objects in front of the door and back again because if I don't, the door flies open.

D) I am much happier not interacting with him whatsoever.
It's amazing how much happier I am when I don't have to see him, hear him, or am forced to answer him (if I ignore him, it just sets off his rage over and over again... it's like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't).  I feel like my old self... before I even met him (or any of his ""friends"" whom I knew a few years before him).  Actually, I feel better than my old self... I feel like the old, old self from when I was in my 20's.  I feel alive and happy and love life and people.  But as soon as he tries to disturb that energy and come back into my energy zone, it's like he purposely messes things up again and I take a long time to regroup and get some footing again. 

So how do I cope?  How?  What do you recommend other than moving out, which, as previously stated, I am working on.  It's like I mean, I am tempted to just get in my car and drive off, but, again, not the smartest plan and I will most likely end up homeless, which would probably make him and all of his cuckoo banana ""ex'es"" quite happy, which I do not want to do.  I feel it's a nice payback, in a way, to stay here as long as I can in a way, because it takes away from their time together... at least their ""in person"" time together.  I know they still find ways to see each other, which gives them a false sense of a thrill because I no longer care what he does (but before, boy oh boy did they get off on sneaking around... must kinda suck now that that thrill is no longer there to drink up and enjoy), even though he still tries so desperately to make me jealous by announcing he's going grocery shopping and, well, 4 hours later comes back with a small bag of 6 items. *insert eye roll here*  Sad.  

So please-- give me some tips, especially those of you who are quite adept at dealing with sociopaths/psychopaths/NPD's!  I'm curious of what you think I should do!  If I was brave I'd start dating, but I honestly don't ever want to be in another relationship ever again after this one... lol.  But I know having sex with someone else right now would really infuriate him.  But, alas, I'm just not like his ex'es... I don't sleep around.",06Oct2019,1

But like, I'm sick and tired of feeling like this. This sucks worse than depression.

What are some habits I can do to try and cut my anxiety back. I need to make changes, and quick, because I think its getting worse and I don't know if I can take it much longer without doing something irrational (I would never self harm, just to be clear).

164,"Ive never told anyone what really is going through my mind. Not my best friend, not my family, not even a random internet stranger. But I cant keep it inside anymore I have to tell someone. I have always been afraid to confront the reality that im lonely. Since I was a kid my social life hasnt really grown. Im stuck with the same people i have always known. I have never kissed a girl nor have I been in a physical relationship. I have recently made a new long distance relationship and I have fallen in love hard but I have no physical attraction to her(its not because im asexual). But I cant tell her so im stuck in a feeling of sadness and love. I have friends but they dont know this and I dont trust them to not ridicule me. Im the type of guy you would never suspect has problems, I live under this mask that im happy and every day it weighs more and more and I dont know how much pain l can take before my spine breaks. Im the most extroverted person youll probably meet but that makes it that much more difficult to pull through because I rely solely on human contact to make me sane. I have no social skills and im awkward if I dont know you even though im extremely extroverted. My life has been a failure I have friends which I dont trust but I dont have a group to hang out with and go to parties which would honestly mean the world to me. It just hurts so I fucking much my life has no purpose. Dont worry I dont self harm nor any other type of inflicted harm nor would I think of doing something worse. My religion and my family prevents me from doing so. Im just living life with this empty void waiting for my death with an unbearable pain which I cover under several layers which no one has seen.",06Oct2019,1
165,"I'm a 17M and I have issues with not looking at girls in a sexual way, outside of my direct family. I have friends that are girls that I'm really close with, one being my best friend and we hang out all the time but I'm scared that one day I'll try something. I want to have a family in the future but this has gone to the point that I'm scared of having a daughter and having sexual thoughts, I've never tried anything on any girl but I'm always scared of me just lashing out and trying to pull something, which is why I tend to avoid physical contact with girls. I've avoided having relationships due to this as well because I always end up having sexual thoughts at the end of any date I go on. I don't want to let this problem go on and end up becoming a rapist or something, I really need help and my parents frown upon me trying to go to a psychologist, as well as being abusive in the past, only stopping because I now have a job and am strong enough to fend them off when they try to hit me.",06Oct2019,1

167,"I think I‚Äôm relapsing. I‚Äôve been suffering from depression and anxiety for the past year. I went into therapy over the summer and came out feeling better. In fact just today I was telling a close friend about how therapy made me feel better and that my mental health has improved. But then I went to watch Joker and the lines ‚ÄòThe worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don‚Äôt.‚Äô Felt like someone was showing me how I lived my life the past year, putting up a happy face and pretending like I was okay, when I was actually crumbling.

The way the film spoke of people and how cold and callous they are when it comes to mental illnesses basically spoke to me on an entirely new level, and I cried the whole way when I walked back home and when I went to bed.

I‚Äôm so sick of feeling this way, I really can‚Äôt relapse as this is my final year of college, and I want to finish it with good memories, not my crippling mental illness. I‚Äôm so sick of this feeling of helplessness, all I kept saying when I was crying was ‚ÄúNo No Not Again, Not Again, Not Again‚Äù

169,"Hey everyone,

I'm needing advice on a current situation that is going on with me and my partner. 

Today we had a Fight and for me when I get heated and upset I tend to shut down and try and walk away or hide. For my Partner she gets anxiety when this happens and she has never explained why this happens after years of me trying to understand.  Today during the fight I asked her multiple times to leave me alone, for her I have to give a time frame... say 30 minutes. The issue is when I tell her to leave me alone and I don't give the time frame she continues to press me which in turn makes me even more pissed off and I lash out with words as a defense mechanism to try and get her to leave me alone...   I don't know how to stop myself mid argument when I'm trying to hide..... She Won't leave me alone because I never gave a time frame so it makes matters worse for me and her... I need some help from people outside of us on this matter because I have no idea what to do..",06Oct2019,1

I‚Äôve probably caused much more pain than joy by existing, more so even by my own mistakes and transgressions. I want to thank everyone who‚Äôs shown this broken soul any shred of kindness over the past 25 years. I only wish you could have seen the real me. It‚Äôs all been a lie.",06Oct2019,1
171,"The past few weeks have been really, really hard (just for background, I have bipolar 2, a severe anxiety disorder,!and chronic PTSD). I‚Äôve cried more in the past week and a half then I have since 2019 started. I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint what was wrong, but something had definitely been not right. 

Finally, my mind collapsed and I had a mental breakdown and I got to the point where if I didn‚Äôt get some immediate help, I was going to kill myself. So after a 13 hour work day, my boyfriend and one of my best friends and I packed myself a bag and drove to a short-term psych inpatient facility. I admitted myself very late Tuesday night and got discharged and back home yesterday late morning.

I have never been to an inpatient facility ever in my life, and even though my friend was prepping me through it (she used to work in one), I still felt at my lowest. I had to take 3 days off work (which caused me an insane amount of anxiety), and I stayed on a stabilization unit to work on my issues. What I came to realize through this time was the following:

1) I desperately need to set boundaries between me and work. 
2) I have so much to be grateful for and need to work on keeping those things in mind.
3) It‚Äôs really challenging being high-functioning because people don‚Äôt take you seriously until you break. 
4) I had all of the tools and skills I needed to cope with my severe anxiety, but I was too overwhelmed in the environment I was in to be able to utilize them.

Doing this is one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done, but it was a positive experience and I‚Äôm glad I did it. I feel so much more alive and ready to take on the things I need to. I share this story so that if there‚Äôs anyone out there who has been or is currently where I was, you CAN do it. I truly didn‚Äôt think I could do it, but I did and was successful (I had a lot of behind-the-scenes help to make it successful also). 

Take care of yourself. Your job is not worth losing your soul and happiness. Toxic people are not worth losing your soul and happiness. Set boundaries if you need to. It‚Äôs okay ‚ù§Ô∏è",06Oct2019,1
172,"What does it mean if I am constantly seeking reassurance regarding every aspect of my life. This has gotten to the point where I have to ask people if I actually like certain things example: music, clothing, and travel.

I feel like I have flatlined on everything.",06Oct2019,3
173,"I suppose I'm hidden by anonymity so I will try to be as honest and detailed as I can about my situation. 

My problems really started when I was just reaching my teenage years, I had always felt different (and not in an oh I'm so different sort of way) but in a real and profound sort of way that scared me deeply and still does, I was (and still am) scatter-brained and unable to maintain focus. 

Back then I had the acceptance of my sexuality as well as the realization of my own strange flavor of thinking to deal with, In a haze of confusion and self-hatred, I flunked school and left at fifteen before my exams with no official grades to my name. Fast forward a few years and I ended up working on placement as an unskilled laborer, four weeks of placement turned to 7 years and I absolutely loved it, I didn't have to think or take responsibility and It wasn't to be expected of me either, it was comfortable and stable, it left me time at home to quietly go about my own hobbies in peace away from other people and distractions. This ended a year and a half ago and my life has been left in ruins, I have had to move back in with my mum, I have lost my home, I have gained so much weight etc and at 27 I feel so unable to comprehend or realize the things I need to do to change this situation, it feels completely hopeless and I cant see a solution to the problem.

The issues I have with myself is my way of thinking and my sexuality, my thoughts are so unbelievably scattered, and far too bizarre to be normal, whenever I see something such as an object in front of me a flood of thoughts, morphing images and pictures torrent through my brain without any effort. A friend suggested I try to smoke weed as it calms him down, but if my sober brain was like a family car then my stoned brain was like a super-car, the pace of my thoughts where unbearably fast it was like an overload. The only thing I have seen that is analogous to my type of thinking is the movies of Google's deep mind AI as it picks out images from the world. I have a feeling that the fast-paced things I'm seeing in my head and the rapid thoughts I'm having are actually supposed to be hidden away from me, perhaps the parts of my brain that help recognize the world around it, and make sense of everything has somehow leaked into my awareness, I don't know what it is, but it's debilitating. It halted my development early on so I have become akin to a man child, some days I feel very floaty and not in touch with the real world, people have accused me of being high or drunk in this state I had a bout of this that lasted for around seven months. I have extreme OCD, I don't trust myself driving so I don't,  I don't trust myself with anything involving someone's safety, I have tried to better myself by getting jobs but I always fail because I appear to absent-minded when in reality I am anything but it's just that all my runtime is dedicated to thinking about something out of my control. The only thing I have found to work is alcohol, it numbs me and makes me feel warm and comfortable, the incessant screeching of my brain is replaced by a mellow hum that lets me think and guide my own thoughts quietly, deliberately and thoughtfully in the way I want to without the constant distraction of my mind spitting out strange nonsense. So I ask anyone that may feel able to answer this question, is this something that is fixable, or is this inherent to who I am and something I am going to just have to deal with?",06Oct2019,1
