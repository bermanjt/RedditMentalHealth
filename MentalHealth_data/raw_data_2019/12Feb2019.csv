0,"For the **tl;dr** peeps: since long before being introduced to CBT, I've been TRYING to look for positive ""angles"" to motivate myself: I try to remember good experiences from the past, imagine incentives for the future, etc. to connect to the present; and though sometimes it works, I've also noticed that the longer it goes on, the HARDER it becomes...as the level of challenge rises, the ""angle"" I have to take becomes more far-fetched and convoluted, ever taking more energy to overcome the basic, emotional/intuitive understanding that **there is something wrong here**:

the act of ""positive thinking"" itself has become poisoned, untrustworthy; my own voice gaslighting me, like an abusive partner, frequently telling me that, ""*no, this is OK. it's YOUR fault if you can't appreciate this.*""

*****

Quick diagnostic background, for context:

- Treatment-resistent depression/[cyclothymia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclothymia/symptoms-causes/syc-20371275)

- ADHD (*untreated till recently as an adult*)

- Had OCD has a child (*grew out of the worst symptoms, but I think possibly just drove those habits ""underground"", so to speak*)

- Was previously treated for BPD (*based on emotional sensitivity/lack of regularity*), but don't relate AT ALL to many of the hallmark symptoms, e.g. [""splitting""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology), cutting, angry outbursts

- At least 8 years of childhood bullying/abuse, including being stalked home and having older children wait outside in the morning to harrass/beat me before class. These were pre-Columbine days when it was typical for adults to respond, ""*You have to stand up to them. They'll go away.*""

- Anxiety. That isn't an official diagnosis, but an obvious outcome of the above and massive problem in itself.

- Was tested for Asperger's with results just slightly off the Autism spectrum—an ""infrared Aspie"", if you will.

*****

If there's one thing I've learned, it's that psychological diagnoses are, at best, vague pigeonholes based on symptomatic expression, meant to expedite the identification of an effective treatment for as many people as possible. That's fine.

Yet, roughly 80-85% of the professionals I've met with have had some sort of CBT/DBT agenda (for lack of a better word) upon meeting them. You know: ""*change your thoughts*"", ""*you can do it!*"", ""*it's important to learn* **skills**"", etc.

I'd go so far as to say that it's become an ideology in that field. An absolute truth.

...

—Look, I *get it*, okay? This is a big thing they seem to be missing: not everyone with a mental illness is new to these ways of thinking. The self-help movement is as old as the printing press†; we're NOT all of us incapable of realising on on our own basic ideas like, ""*your emotions affect how you think*"" (—Christ, lady, I was consciously working around my mood cycles and trying to regulate them by the time I was a pre-teen, if not earlier.)

A lot of us have been trying, some way of another, to ""*change our thoughts*"" etc. much earlier in our lives than when you started your degree, Ms PhD ""clinical psychologist"".

And the behavioural approach really is quite simplistic, idealistic even. Quick example: has anyone else noticed that there are a lot MORE than just simply ""*positive*"" and ""*negative*"" thoughts floating around in their head? And that even the ""negative"" thoughts can have value sometimes?

One more example: DBT teaches something called [Wise Mind](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/wisemind.htm). Quite simply, this isn't a thing. It's portrayed as the intersection between an ""emotional mind"" and ""reasonable mind"", but if you ask me *every* thought has some component of reason and emotion, so *what, exactly, is the* ""wisdom"" *here*???

Indeed, DBT in particular seems a lot of AA (*from what I've read of AA on reddit/experienced via people I've met*): it's an out-of-the-box, ready-made worldwiew applied to its audience via methods that more than slightly resemble a cult. It's not my place to insult everyone who has bettered themselves this way, but at the same time, tbh, I've met more than a few who talk about their experience in a way that feels, to me, suspiciously *prescribed*: ""*Yes, DBT has taught me to be much more mindful and regulate my emotions.*""

I just ...I don't like that approach. I hear the words, but I've never been able to relate to the meaning. Am I really supposed to just say things like this until I finally delude myself into believing I'm ""better"" because I belong the group? Is there no actual hope of understanding and regulating myself coming from what I already done?

I've gotten away from my point a bit, but here it is: these values/ideologies feel like they're frickin' *everywhere* now, it's the go-to POV for most school counsellors (though luckily I've found a good one), primarily care physicians, psychologists, ER personnel, and anyone you're likely to talk to on the suicide hotline.

Yes, it's an improvement on stigamatising mental illness outright, but... gosh, it's still pretty rubbish. In some ways, I think, we've even gone backward, because, ...well, I'll put it this way: boffins performing lobotomies and electroshock therapy to ""cure"" people is shitty, but at least these types of people have got some track record of improving their methods over time (from blood-letting and leeches to modern surgical practice). Behavioural therapy feels more like putting my mental health into the hands of those kids who converted to Wicca in High School: ultimately benign, Gods bless them, maybe even helpful sometimes, but not always the best agents of critical thinking.",12Feb2019,1

2,"Hi all. 

I’m in the worst place I’ve been in a long time. None of my usual coping mechanisms have been working. I’m desperately trying to distract myself but any book or show I try to get into has only served so far to make me feel worse.

3,"To start, I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and major depressive disorder (shocking!) but the past couple of months my mental health has seem to sink to even lower lows. 

first question: is this an eating disorder or am I being dramatic? 

I eat one ‘thing’ a day (a bowl of cereal, an apple, hummus) because most of the time it feels like I can’t swallow and my stomach hurts, and if it’s not that then I just avoid food as much as possible. But I’ll still eat around friends and family as to not cause suspicion but I can’t think about it and eat really fast.

second question: am I body dysphoric or something similar? 

I actually cry some times over how much I hate the way I look. I take pictures from every angle to ‘prove’ to myself that I don’t have any good qualities (physically) and will have panic attacks in the morning trying to figure out an outfit that I can hide enough of my body so I’m comfortable-ish at school.

To you, to the outside world I’m perfectly normal. I own a home, I have a career. I can bench press 250 lbs and run 7:00 minute miles. I graduated undergrad and law school *cum laude*. I’m single. I have a dog and a yard for him to run around in. I have friends. I like to golf. I travel. 

My downfall isn’t what you see. It’s what hides behind the veneer. What lurks just beneath the surface. To see all that I have, to experience all that I’ve done and consider myself a failure - someone who never reached full potential, someone scared to waste that which was given to me.  To be blessed with ability, knowledge, and skill…but at what cost.

A year ago, I was 30, an attorney. I was living a miserable existence. I was simply going through the motions, working at a job I hated for a boss I disliked. I wasn’t suicidal, but every day I woke up hoping to get in to a car crash on the way to work, hoping to somehow injure myself accidentally. I quit that job with no plan, no job lined up, no idea what my next step might be. Turns out my next step was my best step. Admitting to myself I needed help. 

Therapy started as  weekly sessions simply addressing my negative thoughts about work, my future, a career change, or even selling the house and traveling the world. As time progressed my sessions began to focus on me – my thoughts – perceptions of the world – of people. I’ve changed in this year, become a more positive person, more receptive to the world. 

As it turns out, I took 6 months off from work. I emptied what little I had in savings and retirement accounts, borrowed from family and would do it all over again. My physical health was never better. My mental health never more clear. I read books for leisure (something I practically swore off after high school). I walked slower, observed my surroundings, and simply enjoyed life. 

Flash forward another 6 months– I’m 31, and still an attorney. I work a great job with an even better boss. However, life is still a struggle. I still feel I am on an impossible quest to be perfect. I battle alcoholism, fear of failure and a whole host of other shortcomings, but I am learning to accept myself. 

On this journey, I am (albeit slowly) learning (that which is already known) that perfection doesn’t exist. To see myself for what I am.  To accept my accomplishments as exactly that.  My story may not be unique and it isn’t a fairy tale, but it is my story and that’s what makes it great. I share it here, in hopes someone may read it and realize no matter who you are, you can always ask for help.  That you don’t have to be the best person, but can always take steps to be a better person. To step out from behind the veneer. To take what life gives you and not be burdened by it. To hope.

9,"i have to preface this with the fact that of course i am going to communicate this with him. our communication is very strong and we always resolve any misunderstandings or issues we have through talking and it’s something so special and one of the million reasons i love him. but i am always mindful to wait until i have the proper language and thought to communicate any issues i have in the relationship (which i can’t even fall “issues” as we are very strong, but for lack of better words). and right now, i’m just looking to see if anyone else has this same anxiety and if anyone can help me communicate this more effectively. 

my boyfriend, who has a busy schedule between school and work and video game streaming and occasionally other obligations, sometimes doesn’t reply to my texts or take a few hours to reply, and his replies can be pretty short sometimes. for some reason i can’t identify, this is becoming a bigger and bigger source of anxiety for me. two of my absolute closest, best friends are the exact same way, and in fact they can sometimes take over a day to respond to me. i have never had any anxiety about this with either of them. even when they were both out of school and not working, they took from many hours to over a day to respond to me. not once did this cause me to worry about our relationships, and i am always completely understanding of why it may take them a longer amount of time. 

i trust my boyfriend completely and i am very secure in knowing he loves and values and respects me. he treats me like a queen. he takes amazing care of me, has been my absolute rock through some awful times like episodes with my bipolar disorder and ptsd from a sexual assault and more, he protects me and keeps me safe and is always there for me. he is the person i love more than anything and i want to spend the rest of my life with this. i trust him with my whole heart. 

but despite all these things, i can’t shake this anxiety. i don’t know how to talk about this problem i’m having without coming across as clingy or codependent. i have grown leaps and bounds in my independence, managing my anxiety, and becoming a healthier and happier version of myself that i am very proud of. developing stronger independence has been a core goal of mine, and i don’t want it to seem like i’ve given up on it by having this lingering issue. 

additionally, i am far from an introvert in my needs, whereas he is definitely an introvert and needs alone time to sort of refresh and relax and recharge. this is something i fully respect but struggle deeply to understand. it is very, very challenging for me to remember that it is not personal and it’s not because he doesn’t want to be with me. the thing is, i rarely if ever need alone time from him. i am very comfortable coexisting doing our own separate things and that sufficiently fulfills my needs to recharge. usually while he streams i converse with my friends or nap (i’m a napaholic, lmao). we had a conversation a while ago in which he told me he felt i spend my time waiting around for him, that i sleep while he streams because i’m waiting on him to finish so we can be together, etc. it is absolutely true that at the beginning of our relationship i was struggling to overcome the codependency i had on my mother during a period of medical leave from school for intensive treatment for my mental illness and relied on her almost fully for most of my functioning. it took me a lot of work and a lot of time to move past the problems it left for me long-term. i fully admit to this and am no longer that person. but we have been seeing each other about 10 months and been in a relationship for about 8 months, and we have both made strides in our mental health and grown strong together. hearing that he felt i was centering my whole day around him was hard to hear and i feel that i struggled to explain why it wasn’t true. i don’t want him to feel that i am in that place when i explain this problem i’m having. 

tldr; i am struggling to accept my boyfriend’s need for alone time and remembering he is much busier than me and understandably takes a while sometimes to reply to me. how do i communicate this in a productive way? ",12Feb2019,1
10,"First a little backstory:

I am a 22 year old dude that has been bullied from the age of 4 to about a year ago. I have severe anxiety issues, nightmares, trust issues and a number of other problems. 

I have been to 2 psycologists before and that didn't help because i bullshitted my way trough the sessions.

I had an intake a couple of weeks ago and there they diagnosed me  with the following:

Autism spectrum disorder.

Social anxiety

Game Addiction(i don't really play any games but they put me in that category because i use my computer so much)

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday I will be going to the clinic for a 10 week treatment. I don't know what to expect and it's freaking me out. The website mentioned that I will be having daily group therapy and a lot of sports. I have never been in a group therapy session before and I really dislike sports.

11,"so I've been in CBT for a year, and I've been in premarital counseling with my fiance for a few months.  I've been making good progress with general anxiety, depression, anger and self esteem issues. 

the other day me and fiance had a huge blowup fight that was entirely my fault. I spent 3 days thinking, crying, feeling really horrible about myself and then, surprisingly, feeling really great. 

-----

I realized that I've spent my entire life driven by fear, insecurity and a general lack of self worth. I invalidate myself, my issues and my experiences constantly. I've always been so concerned about not being accepted or loved that I've actually driven myself away from those things by my fears and doubts. the fear that I'll be rejected, from anything, or that I'm unlovable. I've put on this mask of a persona because it's what I think people want to see, but it always backfires. I hide behind wit, sarcasm and an oftentimes heavy dose of alcohol. 

I've believed that I don't deserve love, and I manifest that belief by acting it into existence. I yell, I rave, I've begged him to leave me with my actions. I wanted him to know I'm not worthy of his love. 

but I am. and I realize that. I'm not the monster that I thought myself to be. I am thoughtful, intelligent, and deliberate. I take care. I deserve to be loved, safe and content. I deserve to have a stable, well paying job, a fulfilling relationship, a healthy family life, supportive friendships, and a life that I am content with. I speak this into existence today because it's been too long. I've spent a long time believing I'm worthless and it ends today. or yesterday, but whatever.

I have a lot to unpack. I've reached out to a couple of psychiatrists, and we'll see how it goes, but I do feel optimistic. has anyone else experienced this? either way, I would gladly appreciate any advice, feedback or experiences.

12,"I've officially reached the bottom. I can't go any lower, mainly because I was/am planning to kill myself this weekend. The big issue with killing myself is that I don't want to actually die. Bummer.

&amp;#x200B;

So I came here because I am not sure where else to go. I have no friends. I'm not sure how to talk to my family. I don't trust anyone. I feel alone. Social media might legitimately be the worst place to find help for mental issues, but I don't really know what else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not officially diagnosed, so everything I think could be wrong with me should be considered carefully. Right now, I would say I certainly have severe anxiety issues and depression. Importantly, these seem like resulting mental issues from my initial problems  I am obsessive compulsive (my maladaptive daydreaming might fall under that, too) and have been since a child. I am certainly paranoid and was as a child. I'd stay up all night staring out my window, certain someone was going to sneak in and kill me, or watching me. I have always had severe phobias about virtually everything (driving, sex, sports, germs, stairs - when alone on a staircase I would run up them, thinking someone was always behind me, shower - well, more the curtain than anything else, it had to be open, or I thought someone would stab me). Childhood delusions plagued me (I would irrationally think God was talking to me through household objects, I thought my father was molesting me as a child - trust me, this was not true, I'd think people were out to get me - in general, I'd say I have the delusions of a schizophrenic, but I am not comfortable posting all of that...)

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am in my fourth year of college. While I've had people talk to me, try to start friendships, I no longer let my personality out. Originally, I'd say middle school to high school I was arguably a ""popular"" kid - or at least well known. I had friends in practically every group (nerds, jocks, cool girls, cool guys, friends with the black kids, white kids, asian kids, goth kids, everyone really). I won funniest for senior superlatives. I'm not shitting.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I'm funny anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm fun to laugh at. It sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

In eleventh grade when my usually abusive mother and her boyfriend got back together, I fell into a depression. I completely alienated myself from my main friend group (nerds, we'd chat on Xbox all the time). Since I was now spending time home completely alone, my paranoid thinking basically got out of control. I lost my mind, gradually. I went to one school, got even more depressed when my mentally ill roommate (not joking, two crackpots in one room - surprisingly it wasn't actually fun!) tortured me for one semester. He'd stay up all night and make noise to keep me awake, he sexually harassed me, he would use my things against my wishes, he'd intimidate me, and make me feel miserable. He quit after the first semester because he stopped going to classes and was failing. I forgot to mention I'm a pushover. It sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

I went home after that at a local school. It was easier until I became a hypochondriac. Now I go to the doctor's all the time for stomach issues. I'm at a bigger campus now. Still no friends, and I've basically given up.

&amp;#x200B;

I regret so many things. I'm embarrassed I don't talk to my friends, and I'm mad none of them reached out even though this is all my fault. I'm a loser. A fool. An idiot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know what's wrong with me, I know too much. I don't know how to fix it. I wish I did. My mother, who I love the most, is a witch. She's cruel, homophobic (I'm gay too, yay), physically abusive (quick story, one time she beat the shit out of me and caused a blood vessel to burst in my eye because an ""old friend"" was back in town and she wanted to drop me off at my drug addicted sister's house and I refused). I still love her. The rest of my family thinks I'm crazy just for that. Wait till the find out...

&amp;#x200B;

My dad, God bless him, is a doofus. A well meaning, hard-working, doofus. I don't like him. He loves me. I'm also I piece of shit, btw. He's the only one who would really help me (my mother kicked me out the minute my father's child support ran out, she's a no go for stuff like this). He's poor, and I need to be institutionalized. Permanently, and I am not fucking joking.

I don't even know how to put it in words. I have no idea when it started, one day I just realised that this is my life now. I couldn't care less about most people. But once in a while there's someone who I get extremely attached to.  I over idolize them and think about them way too much(but when they do something even the slightest bit bad I hate them until they do something good again and then I love them again). They have always been female aged usually around 35-50 I think. And mostly they're some kind of authority figures (like a teacher or a therapist). I think this could be because I pretty much raised myself - my father was always drunk or at work and then left us completely, and my mother was rarely ever home because she was working so much and when she was home she was too tired to pay me any attention. She'd often come home and just take it all out on me. She yelled at me a lot, made me listen to all her problems and sometimes hit me. But I was never allowed to cry or talk about my problems because that's a sign of weakness. 
I've learned how not to get so attached to people for the most part. But there is one person I got too attached to and I really can't forget her even though it's been over a year. And it's really starting to mess with my life. She was a teacher in my school and she was the only one to notice I was not okay. So she'd check on me once in a while and sometimes talk to me when she had time. She's still the only person who's ever noticed I have an eating disorder. She told me that it's not worth it and that I'm beautiful just the way I am. I felt like someone actually cared about me for the first time ever. But then I had to drop out in 10th grade to be homeschooled because of all my mental health issues. 
The thing is I can't get over it. It's starting to feel like every single thing I do is to either impress her or make her feel bad for me in my thoughts. I know she can't hear or see me but still. Every decision I make I think about what she'd think about it. I just want her to like take care of me and love me and listen to my problems, and be proud of me. I guess I kind of want her to be my mother. And I know that that is impossible and irrational but I can't help it. And it's killing me because I think I'm usually quite logical and rational. I'm now 18 but I'm still in high school(11th grade). And every cell in my body is telling me that this is wrong and fucked up. But I'm thinking about going back to the same old school (that I otherwise hated) just to see her again. After a year. And I know this is bad and lowkey manipulative, and this isn't really me but it's all I can think about. Like I'm even dreaming about it. I could just stay in my current school, move on, just live my life. But instead I'm deliberately fucking my life up just because of a person I'll probably never actually see again.

I feel so much worse at the end of every useless day, and end up having insomnia. I don't know how to overcome this, it's a freaking cycle that repeats itself every day. I've tried to make lists, but all it does is make me more self conscious of all the things I'm not doing, prioritizing doesn't help much either. I just feel paralyzed, procrastinating every day, trying to fill my head with senseless distractions to ignore what's going on in my life for a few minutes, hours, days. How do I stop this? Had I started working on everything weeks ago I would've made substantial progress by now. I just can't overcome the anxiety, I can't deal with this anymore.

Thanks for reading so far into my rant.",12Feb2019,1
22,"I feel that I should just get this out there regardless of whether I feel it necessary or not, with a large part of it being due to not feeling I need help. This has been the case for as long as I can remember. And because of it, I rarely if ever write about what's bothering me, or what's causing me grief.

It's also because I don't want to just hear the same thing, that ""you're not alone"", ""everyone goes through things like that at one point or another"" and/or, ""It will get better"".  But anyway.

I'm currently 19 turning 20 come May, and I feel like my life is heading nowhere. I continue to tell everyone who vehemently believe that I'm University material, that I'm just taking a year off, that I'll go even if I know at this current time in my life that with the grades I have I'm not even going to be able to go to College.

Not only this but I feel absolutely trapped, bound, and restricted. 

I'm currently living with my grandparent on a farm an hour and a half away from where I usually live getting my drivers license (which is what makes me feel trapped the most) and working a very repetitive 5 days a week, 10 hours a day, Tuesday to Saturday for minimum wage at a chicken hatchery. I mean I don't mind, it's not the worst job in the world, even if it a lot, and a bit monotonous. 

On top of all that I miss my Dad, and my little sister so much, and I know that I won't be able to move back in with them for at least another three months at the earliest and I feel it's driving me mad.      

I almost always feel that to others I present a level of insouciance; a lack of concern or will towards things even if I really do. Its just I don't know how to show it, I grew up in an environment where we rarely had anyone over outside of family. Not really interacting at all with neighbors. I also never really had friends growing up save one. We are still friends but we rarely talk or see each other, but when we do we often have a really good time. 

AND then, furthermore looming over my head is that I have Aspergers which my Dad just off the fly told me while watching Family Guy of all things. Stewy made clones of himself or something and Brian asked about them and he said something to the effect of ""they have Aspergers"", and what does my dad do, he turns over to me and says ""oh yeah, by the way, you also have Aspergers to"". Which really doesn't help because I have no idea if that's true or not, which is already on top of my anxiety, ADHD, and Dyslexia.  And also if anyone was curious I went to therapy, and psychologists when I was 10 or so, and haven't been back since.   

Sorry again if this is kind of in disarray because I find if I try to write proper and all, I don't seem to write a sincerely. also, I'm just writing what comes to mind so if it isn't coherent or match up very well, that's why.

28,"Through some careful introspection, I've noticed that often when I feel anxious, it is because I do not currently have something to obsess over.  I tend to get stuck on something and it consumes my thoughts for a while.  Not to the point of debilitation, but enough that those around me will comment that I seem stuck on something and it's annoying.  These things are usually hobby or lifestyle related (Lego building, drums, zero waste, decluttering).

I have also noticed that when I do not have something to obsess over I begin to feel depressed, and will actually seek out a new obsession.  The more I try to unfruitfully find something to dwell on, the more anxious I feel and can become noticably depressed, once again to the point where people have made comments.  This is usually exacerbated if I do not have an event or plans in the near future to look forward to.

I realize this is not a serious issue and I do not get to a point where the depression lasts for more than a week or so, but it is unecessary and I feel like now that I've started to identify the cause of the depression, I feel like there has to be a way to combat it.

Is this a common issue people face or could this be some sort of mild obession thoughts disorder?  I'm just not sure if this is something that there is a prescribed methodology to fix.  I just wish that I could relax and didn't feel like I needed something to constantly be mulling over in my head and making myself justification to avoid feeling depressed.

30,"Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I had anxiety and depression, mostly felt like disenfranchised with everything and anxiety attacks made me feel extra shitty.  Then around a month or two ago I was forced into non-consensual sexual activity with a female at a party while I was drunk.  I have a hard time opening up about this because, well, toxic-masculinity I guess.  A 180lb muscular guy being forced into sex acts at a college party? I feel like I'd be laughed at.  Now I'm miserable and my depression has gotten worse.  I have a hard time doing anything besides going to class.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm prescribed Celexa (Citaloprolam) and on 20mg right now until I work myself up to the maintenance dose, as well as Klonopin (Clonazepam) in .5mg tablets that I can take between .25-1mg according to my psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like the Celexa is working, I'm still miserable.  The Klonopin helps with my anxiety, but I've had substance problems in the past and to be honest, sometimes I feel like it's a crutch, because once it wears off I'm back to normal.  Lately I've been drinking a lot to try and numb it all.  I can't sleep well at all.  I go to bed around midnight, don't fall asleep until 4 unless I'm off of a Klonopin.  I feel like I'm treading water and eventually I'm gonna give in and drown.  My libido is terrible and I guess I can say I'm having other sexual issues like symptoms of ED as well.  

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I feel like these traditional methods aren't working.  I've experimented with holistic methods such as meditation and it doesn't work for me, at least the way I'm doing it.  Should I ask for a different drug?  I've heard good things about CBD, but as a stoner I'm skeptical. I don't want to live this way anymore, and I'm seeking help before this cross becomes too heavy to bear.

33,"Hi, so I'm 19F and have had a bit of a wild ride with mental health; intermittent anxiety, depression and hypomanic episodes with cool spells in between.  I've been diagnosed with GAD but am awaiting diagnosis for the other two as ssris trigger mania in me.  I'm not entirely sure any of this is relevant though. 

All of my life I've been fairly introverted and kept a lot of unusual habits.  Collecting same colour drink cans, arranging from small to large, nothing life changing or detrimental just diff.

The biggest one, and the one I've always wondered about, is that I compulsively write words behind my teeth with my tongue as I hear or think them.  Language has always fascinated me and perhaps it's this interest that wills me to do this.  I will use a neat, joined up font when I do it. If the sentence has an odd amount of words, I will repeat it to make it even.

I also compulsively chew the inside of my mouth and again endeavour to chew 'evenly' and cannot just do one or the other.  This is bothering me as my cheeks or tongue will end up bleeding because I just cannot get it even.  Its causing ulcers also.

Why is this?  I've done these for as long as I can remember existing and experience genuine distress or I feel 'off' if I don't do them.  Perhaps a coping mechanism for underlying anxiety?  Any input or discussion appreciated. ",12Feb2019,1

Idk if this is where I should even post this.

25, Male

Sometimes I wake up and realize I told a complete lie. Usually something that will hurt me.

Example:

This past weekend I went out of town with my Mother and Stepdad. Me and my step dad went out to a bar, got drunk, went back to the hotel, fell asleep. 

At some point I woke up and texted my Significant Other(S/O) and told a whole story about how I invited people back and almost Cheated on my S/O but I ended up not. Rightfully my S/O is very upset with me just because I would even invite people back to my hotel room and even get close. I tried to explain that it never happened, but I mean why would they have any reason to trust me. After all, I texted them at 4am apologizing and telling a story.

Now I understand I was drunk which obviously effects things. But why would I lie about something that could(And it looks like it is) ruin maybe the greatest relationship I will have ever been in. 

I have other examples if anyone wants another one. 

——-That’s The Main Q, here comes some backstory stuff——————

I used to get really suicidal almost randomly for no reason at all. I would get really depressed for about a week then I would be fine. I changed a lot of things in my life to help with that including finding someone that could help me through it all. 

Is there a part of me that just wants me to be alone or sad all the time? Is that even a real thing?

37,"Well here we are, and let's just jump into it. It's currently 11 PM and I'm going to rant about my mom because her relationship with me is extremely toxic I’m going to divide this into numbered parts, all explaining why I dislike my mom 

1. Control freak

My mom is a giant control freak, she limits everything i do and monitors everything i do for no reason, I did nothing that should cause her to mistrust me she also does this with every single one of my siblings this plays into number 2. 

2. Helicopter Parent

She's not a helicopter parent as much as she's a control freak but it really makes me paranoid all the time because i'm afraid she's going to use something against me 

3. Restricting My Social Life

Since she restricts most of my online accessibility, it's hard for me to do anything with my friends anymore. I'm a big introvert and I like to play games with my friends and be creative and build things on games, and because of her restrictions it's like being grounded forever and you can't see them at things like school either. 

4. Living Through Me

My mom has make me and my siblings do many things that she did when she was a kid for some reason, and at this point she's living through me. For example, she made me get a job at a big company that she worked at when she was my age and she requires all my siblings to do one sport 

5. Takes Anger Out On Us

My mom tends to take all her anger out on me and my siblings all the time whenever she is irritated and/or mad i dont know why this is but she doesnt like hit us she just yells 

(So the next points will have to do with my broken family, my parents divorced when i was 4 so ive been dealing with this for a while)

6.  The Child Support Money

My mom gets a LOT of money from child support and I know this because I recently found a check to my mom worth half a million for kid expenses and she doesn't use it on us at all. Maybe like a fraction sure, but not a lot. She mostly uses it for luxurious things like cars and houses. Our current house could've been bought with that check, or something similar to it for all I know. 

7. Impact On Me

All of this stuff has turned me into a negative, really fucking depressed person with a hint of social anxiety. Now please note, I am not diagnosed because of my fear to tell the doctors because I'm afraid of telling them and the judgement that comes with it, and anxiety and depression are closely linked. I started feeling depressed around maybe 12 when I noticed my feeling of hunger was no more, and to this day I don't really feel hungry anymore, honestly I need help but I can't get it because I’m so afraid and scared. The only ones who are helping me through this are two really good friends who I don't deserve. If there's anyway to get out of here please help me. ",12Feb2019,1

But the memory that haunts me is that when I was younger I felt sexually assaulted by someone close to me, two people actually.

It got so bad that I broke down and cried because I didn't think my brain would ever feel normal again.

47,"Hello I am Shadow, and I would like to share a little story about my experience with OCD and how it has effected my life over the years, in the hopes that someone might not feel alone in this. 
Back as far as I can remember since this incident I had in 5th grade involving kids beating me up and my cousin taking their side, I have had this little voice  and feeling of reassurance when I complete a certain task like flicking on and off the light a few times, touching something a few times, minor things such as that. 

However, over the years it started getting worse with more stress and drama, and those tasks became increasingly complex and hard to complete correctly, as there is so many tasks and thoights filling up my mind that I cannot tell which task to do and just lose concentration and end up failing said task resulting in a series of..... setbacks. 
Whenever I don't complete these tasks correctly or at all, I get a feeling like something bad is going to happen to my loved ones and those I care about, then the anxiety kicks in. I see visions, and scenarios that are all too real to deny, it tells me that I can avoid doing this by completing a task, or a set of tasks until I feel better. 
And I feel as though by doing this, it protects them amd it seems as though that whenever I dont, something bad happens to them, like my grandmother going to the hospital or other things that which are equally as bad. It has controlled me for years now and I now have the will to rebel against it, however it had proven difficult, and i got into a series of complications to try and bypass my ocd and alleviate the anxiety and crowded thoughts for just a few hours, then sfter that the flood gates open, then I am a wreck for the next few days to weeks, causing for me not to be myself and for my ocd and anxiety to take even more advantage of me in my vulnerable state. Eventhough this happens like a cycle, I still feel compelled to do the same thing, just to help alleviate it, just for awhile, just to have a break from it all for just awhile. 
This cycle has been going on for about a year now and has caused me to be behind in my dreams and my goals, and has caused countless setbacks. However, I always feel compelled to do this... I do not know why to be certain. I can only theorize about it now, and hope to become better. 

Thank you for reading my complex story, and I hope that my struggles with ocd and other illnesses could let others know that they are not alone in this, and give them hope. As that is what I hope and strive to do is help others, and give them some hope for a better tomorrow.

I don’t really feel very excited or happy about anything. I don’t feel sad much either, I just have a kind of dull outlook on life.  I have trouble feeling anything, really.  I feel like I’m just faking emotions most of the time, and I don’t have any real passions. I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life, because I don’t feel that strongly about anything. 
I know that mental illness runs in my family, I can’t remember if it’s depression or anxiety or both, but I know my mom and my brother take medication for something.  I never asked either of them about it growing up, because I didn’t feel like it was my place and I don’t have that close of a relationship with either of them where I feel I can ask about it. 
I’ve never had many friends, I just feel afraid of talking to people and just constantly feel like the more people get to know me, the more they’ll be put off by me and end up hating me. Whenever I get friends, I get badly possessive of them and I hate it because I act out in stupid ways because I’m so insecure about losing them, or I twist the things that they say in my mind to where I think that they hate me. And I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve never seriously considered suicide, but I’m just not happy and I’m not sure what is wrong with me.

49,"Hey there! I just wanted to post to share my personal stories, because I'm a little concerned with my mental health and wanted to share my story. I don't really like confiding in anyone, but issues I've had as a child seem to have resurfaced somewhat. When I was about 8-13, I had some really weird and unreasonable issues. This might sound crazy, but I had a lot of issues when being alone. I always felt like something was out to get me when I was by myself, especially in the dark or areas with only one exit/entrance. For instance, I would turn a corner in my house and look in an empty room and see a black figure staring at me, like the creature from the ring or something. I would always keep walking and when I turned back to look, nothing would be there, It was the craziest thing. I used to have this imaginary and very persistent friend I would talk to in my head, and if I tried to push it away, it wouldn't want to go away and I felt bad for pushing it away. I wouldn't personally see it, it was something in my head I couldn't push away. It sound stupid but I really bothered me. I would occasionally hear odd sounds in my head every month or so, it all seemed very strange and unusual. I also had weird obsessions with loosing things and washing my hands. I was very concerned with washing my hands because germs were something that really irritated and bothered me, although I wasn't a very organized or clean child, so it didn't make sense. I also hated ""sticky"" feelings from things like grease, if that makes sense. I also felt like thing were going to fall out of my pockets like my wallet. I would keep my hands in my pockets when walking to prevent loosing them, and when my family would go out I would have to check under the car SEVERAL times to make sure I hadn't dropped anything. After dealing with this for years as a kid, I was able to ""talk"" and think myself out of all of this by telling myself how ridiculous and unusual this all was. Eventually I changed schools and went to high school. I was anxious to make friends but after I while I settled in and had a decent social life. Now I'm 19, and it seems like some of these problems I had left in the past are resurfacing. I now have anxiety issues when meeting and talking to people I don't know, and people I've worked with at my job for a year or several months I am still very uncomfortable with. I feel like they judge me although something in the back of my mind tells me they probably don't. I have a much harder time connecting with people than I previously did, and sometimes I feel like everyone is out to get me. I think I look way to much in people's reactions when speaking to others. I have problems communicating and focusing, especially when people are trying to conversate with me. I avoid a lot of social interactions and the more people that are around, the harder it is for me to focus. As a kid with the symptoms I discussed, this wasn't any issue, despite having a lot of unusual issues. I either feel very tired or anxious, and I again feel like something is out to get me when I'm alone. I often think sounds coming from around me are coming from something dangerous, further investigation always reveals them to be something harmless. When it is dark, I often mistake objects or clothes around me to be dark and scary figures. Sorry for the long post, but I'm really confused as to what any of this means and if it relates to some common disorder. I was always ahead in grades in school, and I felt like I picked up on things quickly. I have a strong work ethic and drive, but my focus, memory, and ability to socially interact have been terrible lately. I don't want to fail because I won't talk about emotions and issues.

51,"I’d say I’m very self-aware of my mental health and I tend to get help when I can - which is why I got a psychiatrist, because I know what I can get from them, which is meds. Psychiatry is mostly known for prescribing meds and diagnosis but since I have been diagnosed by a previous psychiatrist, I just need meds. I feel that if I’m aware of what I want (which is benzos), the psychiatrist will focus on other treatments that aren’t related to meds (because he may sense that I am a junkie just wanting pills). But, I do need pills and I can provide symptoms of my illness to prove that I am in need of them. I constantly research the best treatments, so I know what I want. Do any of you know what I’m getting at? I have my first appointment with one so I’m concerned on how I should approach the situation.

53,"Ok, so... I’ve been hitting my mental health journey really hard for about two-ish months now. I even started documenting it on this sub because I wanted to go back and watch my progress. I thought everything was going really well! I was stoked — loved my counselor, loved that I was getting healthier... things just seemed like they made sense and like I was finally on the right track.

Well, I’m also wondering how much of that was due to counseling and how much of that was just due to me changing the way I was personally addressing my issues independently. So far I’ve quit smoking completely, quit smoking weed, decided to go back to school and have already been accepted, started to communicate better... seriously all of this and more in just 2 months after probably a decade of these really awful habits that I couldn’t shake despite every attempt and reason; even my depression (MAJOR depression, professionals even going so far as to wonder if it was bipolar 2) is almost non-existent and even my bad days are filled with way healthier choices.

So far, I attributed this to counseling. I figured this was because I was getting great advice from a great individual and I was one lucky duck. I kept going and going and making sure I hit every appointment I could, plus some classes that were recommended to me by my counselor, but today really put some things into perspective and I’m not entirely sure how to take it.

My counselor confuses the hell out of me. And I sincerely don’t get anything out of these classes... I’m going to counseling to address 3 major issues in my life: the way I process stress, the way I handle anger, and the way that I speak to people when I’m angry (specifically yelling). These are the three biggest things that have kept my life in a constant state of turmoil, or my relationships, or my decisions. Absolutely none of these three things have been addressed and I’ve been given 0 tools or suggestions on how to fix them.

Here’s what my session from **last** week did recommend: *stop trying to control everything and have no expectations.* Sound advice, right? Followed by: *Set boundaries and advise people that they are free to do with their life what they will, but that if they continue to do the things that hurt you that you’ll need to leave or make other major changes.* Very wise. I agree and have been doing this for a while actually. My follow-through is probably 50/50 but, still, I’m only half a push-over. 

Now, when talking about my disabled friend, who is mentally handicapped, and who I’m also a live-in caregiver for: *You are not in charge of his life... You cannot control what he does... You need to stop having expectations for him and just let him do whatever he wants to do. You can encourage him, or explain, but do not dictate how he lives his life.* Okay... cooool... makes sense, in a fortune cookie kind of way... 

Now let me tell you why I’m confused as hell. 
Let me say the same thing but in different terms:

*Don’t have too high of standards for people and also try not to control what they do. If they do something that crosses your boundaries then you need to sit them down and tell them they can do what they want but they’ll be facing an ultimatum that they can change their behavior or you’ll split. *

So: don’t expect anything from people, unless they don’t meet your expectations, then you need to give them an ultimatum that you’ll leave if they don’t do what you want, but also don’t be controlling.

Wtf?! 

I still don’t know how to just manage my anger. I still don’t know how to manage my anxiety better. Also, if I don’t intervene in my friend’s life (the handicapped guy I mentioned earlier) he’ll have seizures without anyone around assisting him (he can physically not think coherently through his seizures and will make legitimately life-threatening decisions after because he’s still in a fog and doesn’t see the danger, this has happened a lot). He also cannot process the need to do things like laundry, cleaning his room (which becomes a safety hazard), or taking showers because he just kinda has crappy habits. 

She told me today that I just need to let him do whatever he does and if he goes 2 months without a shower, whatever. If he decides to ride his bike after having 4 major seizures and veers into traffic, whatever. If he decides to leave his room a mess and trips over all his stuff and puts a hole in his wall where his head hit (this has happened 3 times since I’ve lived here even with my assistance), whatever. 

Ok... so she wants for me to choose neglecting my job as a way of managing my stress. That’s how I’ll manage my stress, just not do my job and let somebody who’s handicapped mess himself up daily. Seriously, wtf. This is like Facebook advice, know what I mean? Have a problem: go to extremes. Don’t try harder for yourself, just make it everybody else’s problem that they have to deal with because it’s too much for you...

Long story short, I’m gonna start reading some books and stop going to therapy. I quit all the things I mentioned regardless of counseling, she didn’t even know I had those habits as far as I could tell. I think it was because I felt better that I was taking care of myself for the first time in a long time... either way, I really don’t like coming home so confused, it actually makes things worse and causes problems that weren’t there before, which stresses me out more and causes more yelling... I think I just need to pick up some definite anger management tips and go from there 🤷🏻‍♀️ interesting twist...

TL; DR: I’m going to probably stop going to counseling even though I really liked it at first. This advice is contradictory and isn’t actually helping me, but I’m helping me and I’m proud of that. Any self-help lit on anger management and stress management would be really appreciated. ",12Feb2019,1

63,"I'm not sure where to post this, so hopefully this is okay.

I'm not sure what's wrong with me, and this has happened more than just tonight. I was doing so good this semester though, which is why I think I feel so down about it as to try and seek some kind of answer. 

Tonight, had to some homework to do that was due tomorrow. It was really easy homework, just about 20 rough thumbnails for a newsletter we're designing in Layout class. But I just .. couldn't bring myself to do it. I woke up around 1pm, and thought ""I'll do it after I get up"" and then sat on my phone in bed until my boyfriend came home at 3pm. Got up to eat lunch, and thought I'd do it after lunch. I opened up all my materials, and did a tiny bit like double check due dates, nothing that required getting up off the couch. Got hungry again, and thought ""well I'll eat something and do it after. I can watch a youtube video while I eat"". I then proceeded to watch youtube video after youtube video, so aware of the time passing but just feeling unable to force myself to do my homework. I wasn't even enjoying the videos I was watching. At some point I switched to instagram, then to reddit, going past my ""I'll stop at 10pm and do homework"" deadline in my head quickly.

I was so hyper aware of every second passing, and every second made me feel more helpless and anxious. I could've fixed it all so easily, I could've just sat up and done my homework so I could sleep in time to get up at 6:30 tomorrow, but I just .. didn't. I got a headache, and was thirsty, but didn't even do the simple task of sitting up to take a drink of water. I didn't stop until my phone finally died a couple minutes ago at 2am. Boyfriend went to bed forever ago at 8-9pm ish, so he wasn't there for this. I decided to just skip the homework so I can maybe get in bed by 3 (still have to shower because I didn't do that either), but I wanted answers so I'm typing this up. 

I'm just so frustrated, especially because I have a lot on my plate this week meeting deadlines anyways, I don't really have time to make up for work I could've easily done earlier in the week. I have procrastination issues, but the way I feel whenever this happens goes beyond that, I feel so not in control of my body it makes me feel sick.

Stuff like this happens in other ways too all the time. The most common is laying in bed like 3 hours after I woke up either on my phone wasting away or staring at the walls. I'll lay there until I ache, and usually only get up because I feel ashamed enough or my boyfriend gets me to get up. Another one that makes me sad when I think about it is I haven't drawn in nearly a year (and have been struggling with drawing at all for like 5 years) even though I really enjoy drawing and used to all the time. I'll do random, none sense things I'm not even enjoying (nothing useful like the chores I also ignore) late into the night when I got only 3 hours the night before and have to wake up early again in the morning. I don't have problems falling asleep, I just never want to unless its a nap in the middle of the day.

When my boyfriend asks me about my behavior, or asks if there is any way he can help because he's obviously concerned, I get super defensive. He asks why I can get up for work and school (although barely, I'm often 5 min late to everything) but can't get up otherwise and I don't have an answer. I don't like that this is a problem because I can't explain it. How do I tell someone that I feel like I *can't* do anything but sit there mindlessly staring either at the walls, or a screen?

I graduate from college next year, and I'm terrified I wont be able to land an internship or a job because I can't force myself to do the work involved with making a portfolio. I've had bouts of bad depression a couple times in my life, where I really knew I was depressed, but I'm not sure what this is. I get anxious about doing things, but I'm not sure it's anxiety. I'm just really lost.

I know I should find a therapist to get real answers, but I'd have to find a good one and I don't think I could put in the energy to do that when there are so many other things I have to force myself to do that take my energy. I'm also still technically on my parent's health insurance, and I don't really want them to find out and definitely can't pay for one right now.

Sorry for the long post, I mostly just wanted to vent, and wanted to know by people who know more than me if this behavior does point towards anything.

I've had quite severe depression for as long as I can really remember, always moody and isolated. 
I was suicidal in highschool and still am today. 
Some of my most troubling thoughts though are those that one of my old best friends is planning to murder me one day. I've had this thought since maybe 2010/11, I've forgotten exactly when they started because it's been so long. I tend to tell myself I'm pretty sane otherwise but this can tend to slip out and I'll think it about other people close to me, other close friends and people who I've only had minimal encounters with. Sometimes I feel like I could possibly be more intuitive or even bordering on having some extra sensory perception of just knowing who's dangerous but that's just more crazy thinking. 
I don't trust anyone. Im scared people will deceive me constantly. I lost my girlfriend recently due to me being to sad to deal with and that I made her feel like I was always expecting her to lie and cheat(which I did think all the time)
All the time I was falling in love with my ex I constantly thought how I should push her away now because this old friend will torture her as well to punish me and I couldnt let that happen. Its completely fucked up. 
My mind feels so clear when I have these thoughts and I can't shake them. I'm so convinced it must be real. It destroys my mind. I can't function properly because I'm terrified of my thoughts. It's been years and I've only been able to confide in my father and a couple friends but they didn't know what to do and no one ever mentioned it again. 

I faced trauma from my brother at a young age. He is six years older than I and we shared a bedroom for years. I could have been as young as 4 or 5 when he started bullying. He would smother my face with a pillow all of the time, put me in sleeping bags and drag me around the house, tie me to chairs, chase me and yell at me. It happened for years. 
I figure this is part of the problem and I confronted him about it and was so mad we ended up fighting and he only talked down to me and then threatened to stab me. I've written him out of my life. 
Ive also been cheated on several times by past girlfriends which really shook me up and must contribute to me ruining my relationships.

I feel like my mind's broken. I'm a broken person inside. I cry nearly everyday and sometimes for no reason. There's so much more that's happened that may have contributed but I just want ways to fix my thoughts. I've tried meditation retreats and exercise and eating well but the paranoid thoughts and the worry that all these things are going to happen stop me from living my life and I lose everything that's important to me.

70,"I really hate life right now. With my Apnea and digestive issues, I have been getting 5-6 hours of sleep only every day. I function better on 6 (still tired, but better with coping with my mental illness), but on 5, I become easily overwhelmed, depressed, anxious, and my OCD begins to go crazy (I get more intrusive thoughts than usual).

I am going to get CPAP treatment sometime in the future, but this has gone on for about 6 months. Some days, I'll peak at 7 hours of sleep without using my insomnia medication (my GP said to be careful with insomnia medication as it can make the body refuse to wake up when it loses air)—otherwise, I'm either a dead man walking, or a zombie who can't do anything right.

This is really affecting my school. Despite being high functioning (at the detriment of my own health), I have abandoned a lot of my own personal and social life. I get easily overwhelmed and perfectionist about tasks. Right now, it's college scholarship season, and I'm way behind and trying to pull through. But it's like my lack of sleep and obvious hell of pain is invisible to everyone, but once I reveal it, I'm just making excuses. I don't control my breathing when I sleep! I don't control how my mental illness reacts to obviously unhealthy sleep!

Is there anything I can do? I want to reach out to teachers, but I just think they're going to say I am making excuses.

71,"So for the past few months I've been feeling pretty great, no feelings of hopelessness, always having something to look forward to, been more sociable and been a hell of a lot less anxious.

I'm F 19 and have struggled with an eating disorder, anxiety and depression since I was 14. It got so bad I wasn't getting out of bed, I stopped going to school and was lucky enough to have a teacher willing to come to my house to tutor me. I stopped talking to my old friends, fought with my parents constantly and overall just felt, pointless? It's hard to think about now.

But over the past year or so I've been feeling better, more positive. Before I genuinely couldn't see a future for myself, then suddenly I could. I was more willing to be in contact with people and more confident in talking to them. 

Now I was in therapy seeing someone once a week most of the time, mainly focusing on aspects of my anxiety and depression rather than the eating disorder because it hadn't helped in the past. They're came a time when I was 17 that I decided I wanted to start focusing on that more, the whole eating thing, and so we tried different things slowly. Unfortunately  this was just prior to my 18th birthday, and being 18 I would have to transfer from the young peoples part of the hospital to the adults, seeing new people ect.

I was nervous but overall optimistic about the change. As we had been focusing on the eating disorder it was decided that's the service I would attend. I started seeing a dietician from the adults service every week, then every 2 weeks, then every month. And it sucked.

I wasnt completely comfortable being open with her and ended up falling in to a sea of lies I couldn't control. I'm a perfectionist, so when she would ask me to do something and I couldn't, she would ask me why, I did my best to explain that it was more of a psychological thing, but shes a dietician and didn't really help with that. It made me feel invalid so I would like, saying I had ate this and that and made all this progress when in reality I'm probably the worse I've ever been eating wise. Going from talking to someone weekly about the thoughts I was struggling with to nothing, it was just hard and i don't think i developed the best coping mechanisms.

I'm 19 now and finally started the group last week at the hospital, it was the whole reason I'd been seeing the dietician up to this point, just till the group started. I've waited almost a year for it, and I don't think it's going to help. The optimism I had to get better and eat again is gone, i ran out of steam. I've been feeling okay and honestly don't really want to get better. 

Now I know how that sounds, but hear me out. I've been feeling better overall this past yearish, but  since November more notably. I've been happier, less anxious and I've been looking after myself more, showering, going outside etc. And so I'm scared to change anything in my life right now, I don't want to get better from my eating disorder because im scared it will bring back all those horrible feelings I had for so long. It scares me to death and I don't feel like I can tell anybody because I know how backwards my logic is. I just don't know what to do. Am I just lying to myself? I'm just so scared. I can't go back to that, I just don't know what to do.",12Feb2019,1

78,"I’m probably gonna sound like a mega jerk from the title, but let me explain. I met a friend my freshman year of college, who is very timid, soft-spoken, and overthinks a lot. I have this tendency to befriend people who need help, and it’s always worked out for me. At the time I assumed this friend had extreme anxiety, maybe depression, and possibly OCD.

Well, three years later I feel like I’m spiraling downward the longer I’m around her. After two years she told me she suffers from psychosis, and a lot started to make sense. She’s paranoid about everything and everyone. She has memorized my schedule and seems to pop up everywhere that I am, and she always ALWAYS wants to talk. Talking to her includes endless circles of rambling about things that I am NOT equipped to deal with. When I said she overthinks, she’ll spend an hour analyzing the tone of my voice in our last conversation and come to the conclusion that “I’m upset with her.” She’ll spend two hours analyzing somebody in class who has been “stealing the vibe” she was trying to give off, so therefore this person is “trying to become her.” Those are just normal daily things, because her psychotic episodes can get far worse than that. She refuses to take her medication, will not see the counseling services our college provides (“the counselors are nosey, they are bad people, it’s not good for me to talk to them”), and will not go to therapy. She insists that the only person who can save her is God, and that SHE has to pull herself together through God’s grace (as if all this is just a test). 

If I’m not around, she will spend hours staring at a wall and and thinking herself into what she calls “holes.” She “digs holes” and can’t get out of them. She makes me feel bad if I’m not with her 24/7. She makes things up about my other friends (I think to try to discourage me from hanging out with anyone other than her). And last year she did something awful to me that I forgave her for, telling myself she needed me, but now I’m starting to get bitter about the pain I went through because of her careless actions last year. 

I just feel like I can’t do this anymore. I want to tell her that I can’t talk to her until she sees a therapist, but I’m too afraid that she’ll hurt herself if I do that. I’m miserable every day because of her, and it’s honestly not my job to fix this but she makes me feel like it is. Please, can somebody help me??

83,"Posting here because my family and I are at a complete loss of what to do, any any advice from a professional / someone who has experience dealing with schizophrenics would be much appreciated.

My cousin (33M), whom I haven’t spoken to in about a year or so, recently moved to Canada to start a new life, and the last time we spoke he was completely normal. However lately he’s been displaying deeply disturbing behaviour online, updating his statuses erratically and having full-blown nonsensical conversations with himself complete with strange symbols and emojis. From what I can decipher, these statuses and comments all have to do with the supernatural (God, demons, spirits etc.), authority figures coming after him (“911 refuses to help. Where is the police? So you guys wanna kill me?”), and then would comment a completely unrelated link to a Kylie Minogue music video or whatever after. A large majority of his uploaded pictures are of Egyptian / Mayan cults, conspiracy theories, and his conversations with himself would often spiral into 100+ comments (yes. All by himself: “So what is going on then. No police arrived. And I’m dreaming everything up. And trying to send people to gaslight to say I am unwell. I mean…”).

His mother (who lives in a different continent) is at a complete loss of what to do, as he’s been sending her truly vitriolic messages about how she is a terrible mother (she really isn’t), that his grandparents are angry at her, that she’s a free mason, that the devil is coming after her and he never wants to see her again. She’s terrified of reaching out to him in fear of riling him up even more, and of what he might do. 

To make matters worse, when I reached out to him with a casual “hey how’s it going” message, he uploads a screenshot of his lock screen with my message notification on it being all like SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE AFTER ME - but above my message was an even more disturbing message from someone we don’t know (let’s call him Adam) about “bringing papers for him to sign in an hour”. I have no idea what Adam’s intentions are, and what kind of documents he’s making my clearly unhinged cousin sign. 

We’re getting extremely worried, and we have no idea how to deal with this because he’s all alone in Canada, and there isn’t any history of mental illness in my family (as far as I know of) for us to learn from. He obviously is a danger to both himself and his community, and he’s ignoring all his friends and family.

What advice would you give me in this situation? Should I get a local mental health facility in his area to intervene? Fly over to Canada and get him home by any means possible so he is with family?

I'm a mum and student and rarely have that time to just BE. and I have nobody to just BE with.

I recently slept with an ex but he has basically no emotional capacity and understanding and is a control freak and very detrimental to my mental wellbeing. I don't care about him but being how I am atm I could very easily find myself latching onto that because of needing these needs to be met...

How do people meet their emotional needs without putting themselves in vulnerable positions that people can abuse?

90,"Hello!

So I've dealt with mental health issues for all of my adult life. Depression and social anxiety mainly, but suffice to say I haven't made the best decisions in life and I'm a bit of a mess of a person. I'm 27 so I can turn things around and am trying to but I'm here to ask for some advice.

A few years ago I finally started taking medication, after years of agonizing on and off about taking medication. I can say that it's an issue that I've put to rest in my mind, enough to be confident that it's not something I will ever really obssess about again. Lofepramine, if it's important, an older type of tricyclic anti-depressant. SSRIs give me awful sexual side effects, and the lofepramine helps a little without side effects that are too bad, so long as I take it properly and regularly.

But my thinking is still an issue. I tend towards thinking about things. Not just thinking but ruminating, going over and over the same issues again and again and again. It feels like I can't ""turn off"" this little engine in my mind that is working far too hard for no real reason or purpose in mind. A few years ago I went down a pretty deep hole thinking about free will, responsibility etc. It was hell, I would obsess, day in, day out about the same things over and over and over and over again, as if maybe I could find some kind of answer without really having any specific question. That was one of the lowest points in my life, I would obsess about suicide daily, and it finally convinced me to start taking medication.

I'm not as bad these days, and I'm trying to help myself. Let myself slip a bit towards the end of last year but more recently I've been making some effort. Just getting up, showering, doing some chores around the house every day. Small but important things. But the thinking is still an issue at times. It feels like I'm in overdrive, almost like a (very) minor manic episode. I'll think and think and think. Sometimes distractions help, other times, not.

I don't work and my days are spent not doing much, so that's obviously something I need to address. I think a large part of it is probably boredom and under-stimulation. I hope to look for some voluntary work soon, and ideally I'd like to have a job before the end of the year, but I'm just trying to take things one step at a time for now, build a solid base of habits to work from.

I was wondering if anyone had any tips or advice that might help me ""turn off"" a little bit while I work towards getting a job or some voluntary work. I have tried mindfulness. I would say it helped a little, and I'm going to start meditating daily again. Even so even the idea of mindfulness itself is helpful, and I do try to tell myself to be mindful when I find myself in these ""overdrive"" moods, but it's not always that helpful. Also, drugs are obviously not a good idea. I became addicted to opiates simply because they stopped me from thinking about things, they ""turned it off"", so to speak. I'm getting treatment for this, I've been on maintenance medications and have reduced my dose to under 10% of what it once was, but currently I'm happy (well, content enough) to stay on this dose while I try to sort myself out a bit, and have something to do every day before finally jumping off. 

Also, exercise, I have exercised daily in the past, and did find it helpful. I am going to start going out in the morning and walk up a large hill near me every morning, large enough to tire me out and get my chest pumping and my throat all parched. But like I said, I'm taking things one step at a time and my current goal for the next week is to get up, tidy a bit and shower every day (I find it really helpful to put a timer on my phone for 30 minutes and force myself to work for that long. Sometimes I find it hard, but often the alarm will go off and I'll be so into it that I'll continue tidying past the alarm).

**tl;dr I get into moods where I think far too much and feel ""pumped up"", and I'm basically asking for any advice that might help me reign in these moods and the incessant thinking while I work towards goals that will likely help me much more with this issue, such as voluntary work or a job.**

I feel like this post is long and rambly because I'm currently in one of these moods, so apologies if it's a bit much, but I hope I've adequately explained the issue and what I'm asking for.

Thank you.",12Feb2019,1

92,"A little back story I will attempt to explain as simply as possible. 

Last year in late early September, I sought emergency counseling on my college campus due to my own concerns about my behaviors and mental health. 

Earlier that week I had impulsively went out to a strip club (I’ve never done this before) drank profusely, and had hooked up with someone, cheating on my boyfriend I was very happy with. That led to a nasty breakup days later that I initiated. I barely slept and I was on an energy high, I outperformed myself at work and felt no need to stop what I was doing. I felt very out of control. 

I also have a history of bipolar disorder in my immediate family (older brother was diagnosed with dipoles depression a few years ago, my grandmother was also diagnosed.)

 Both myself and my therapist both believe that I was in a manic state back in September 2018. We immediately made an appointment with a psychiatrist, but when I finally got to see him for my appointment (about a 3 week waiting period) I was no longer in this manic state, and so I was not prescribed anything as I showed no apparent signs of mania nor depression. 

Fast forward to this week: 
I have been experiencing an energy high, I went to the gym yesterday got a ton of work done, and felt quite productive in my classes. I woke up at 7:45am this morning, about 2 hours before my alarm, and  went to the gym again, with extreme energy. I was on 5 hours of sleep. I feel powerful, confident, and my heart is racing, but it could be from the workout I just had. 
I am supposed to go out clubbing tonight for the first time in a while, I made the plans over the weekend and solidified them last night. 
I feel like I have so much energy, but as of right now, I am not doing anything destructive. I feel I may be experiencing a manic episode, or maybe this is the start of one. 
I’m not sure, as it could just be me wanting to be productive and getting things done. Exercising and doing homework doesn’t seem like a bad thing, so I think I may be second guessing myself. Going downtown isn’t something I’ve done since New Years so I’m excited but I don’t know if this is me acting on impulse and mania or if it’s genuine. 

How am I supposed to know? I’m afraid I will spiral into something dangerous or act out in an impulsive way. But if this is just me being happy, then I don’t want to mis-diagnose myself. 
How am I supposed to know? 
How do I protect myself?

96,"Heyo, it's my first post here, from the beginning I want to apologize if this will come off chaotic and messy because I'm a bad writer and even worse conjurer of thoughts and feelings.

I want to make a confession, generally speaking describe my actions from the last two years with a little background reaching as far as six years into the past.

I was always something you might call an outsider, a rather calm and quiet child, taught to hide my feelings. Also I was your typical short (5'7''), fat and unattractive teenager so it isn't hard to imagine I was constantly backward relations-with-opossite-gender-wise comparing to my fellow mates. Yet, being fifteen I met this girl, let call her M who was my first ever serious girlfriend (strangely enough, being who I was and looking like I was sometimes I managed to ""score"" someting). M was a mess, she came from a very bad home, had a pletora of different issues including social anxiety, lowest self-esteem you can imagine, anger issues, jealous as hell (very bad father figure) which used to show in our, lasting 6 years, relationship. Constant arguments including throwing stuff(at me), insults(both ways), jealousy, destroying whatever there was of my self-esteem(she didn't want me to become to confident because I was, unhumbly speaking, becoming more and more a somewhat handsome young man). So, my teenager years was spent in basically everyday hell. I wasn't able to delevop normal social skills due to her unwillingness to meet other people, we were this couple spending every minute together back then. And what a minutes there were, oh boy. Why did I spend so much time with her if I'm complaining? As I said, a combo of low self-esteem, being just a stupid teenager in love, thinking I will never ever find anyone who would want a thrash of a human like me and childish will to fix the world around did its thing. And as always, the very worst thing of being in toxic relationship are those moments when it's okay, when your significant-toxic other is showing who they are capable of being, those good moments, if you had ever been in similar situation you know what I'm talking(writing) about. Nonetheless, after those six years we finally broke up, lost contact in an instant and haven't spoke to each other for a good two years now. 

I was a wreck. Without any developed social skills, with a negative self-esteem, unable to talk to the opposite gender. But back then I was still young(twenty one), at last I felt the freedom in my hairs and I've lost myself into socializing, alcohol, other fancy ways to just pass the time. Slowly I was recovering, started going to the gym, managed to do something with myself. And then I met my next girlfriend, also M so let's refer to her as a R(she like to be called per Racoon, don't ask, I think it's pretty cute though). R was great, she was cute, very loving girl, also with toxic background so we just understood each other and it clicked. She wasn't your perfect beauty but, god is my witness, I was crazy about her that time. She showed me that a relationship can be a pleasure, can be a normal thing without all that war, those were, in a retrospective now, my happiest days I think. Well not only because of her, I was still in a university, whole life lied ahead of me, full of dreams blah blah. But boy I loved her. Yet, well, destruction of those six years started to kick in. As I mentioned before I was always good in hiding my insecurities and feelings deep inside me and just smiling it out (in my mind showing your feelings is a weakness, men shouldn't show that they are insecure about anything, we have to be always confident, strong and stable - that's not my opinion, don't accuse me of being a prophet of toxic masculinity, but that's the way I was raised and that's my, burned deeply into my mind, perception of the world - because if we wouldn't, there will be someone who is and who is therefore better than us).

Also, it was the time when I finally felt confident about myself, lost some weight, gained some gainz, started to looking and being cool. So here comes my worst part. I met another M (let's just call her M2, same name as first and I'm not in a mood of coming up with fancy aliases). She was seventeen back then, me - twenty two. And yep, I did it, I'm a cheater, never thought I would be since my family is one of the best family model there is, two, sweet old folks who love each other like there's no tomorrow. Why did I do it? Why does one cheat is a better question. Because I could, because I thought it will make me ""better"" person, more interesting, it was something I earned through all those teenage years of being at the bottom of social ladder. Did I feel bad about it? Absolutely not. Do I feel bad about it today, as I am writing this post? Every. Fucking. Day. I feel like a thrash every fucking day of my existence. Does it lower my fault? No. I did it, I'm a bad person. But it doesn't end here, it's getting better. After this incident I became fascinated with M2, slowly losing interest with R so it didn't last long until we broke up. And I didn't even told her about my deed because I didn't want her to feel bad about it. I sold her an usual ""it's not you, it's me, I'm a mess, you'll find someone better etc"". Cheesy. Cowardly. Hey, that's me, let's move on. So, the next half year highlights my worst features. Here in Poland we have this saying - ""Ciągnąć dwie sroki za ogon."" - which roughly translates into ""To pull two magpies by their tails"". We didn't stop contact with R, we became, you can say, friends with benefits because, even though I broke up with her, now I realized that I was still in love with her and didn't want to lost her in my life but I was also into M2 so.. the same goes with her. Time flew, situation was stable that way (if it's appropriate to use the word stability here). After half a year, around October me and M2 started being a regular couple. This is the point when I'm in love with both of them and don't want to lose any of both so you can say, I had a double life. To my, littlest there is, defense, during my lasting one month relationship with M2 I haven't slept with R. Until I did. It was the time I've finally realized that I love her and I don't want to lose her and she's the one so I broke with M2. This time a little ""better"" because I confessed my situation, yet still, this is another thing that I feel like the lowest form of life on earth, I hurt her bad. 

So, as viciously life circles, we were back together with R. But this time it was different. As she called it, she built a wall around her so that no one could hurt her as I did. During our break up/fbw time she also meet a guy whom she liked, nota bene a friend of mine, we were study buddies. But yet, she also doesn't want to lose me, also had feeling towards me still so we were back. Later, after inevitable, yet so satisfying to all justice and karma lovers second break up, she told me that she felt a little forced by me this time because I told her that I want her back but I will completely understand her if she won't have me and that I won't be mad or have any negative feelings towards her but I love her and it will be too painful to keep in touch so we will just part our ways for good. That's the reason she wanted to try again. But, as a bad person I am, I still haven't tell her about my infidelity. Neither about my relationship.

It was another good half a year, with ups and downs, some harsh feelings due to our chaotic past. But well, karma's a bitch, she was into that other guy throughout this whole time (call him D). At one party, I overheard him talking to his friends that when I was out of town, she had a free house for herself, parent's gone for the weekend, so she invited him over. I still don't know if they really met then, I heard him telling that he said no, she said they didn't, but it doesn't matter now. Well, situation being as it was, with her feelings towards someone else, with this, incomparably smaller to mine, infidelity of some sort - we broke up again. This time I thought for good. And it devastated me. 

You know, another part of my thrashness is - I'm a huge hypocrite. It hurt bad, even though it wasn't a full out cheatery, this thought itself, that she's not mine, that she's into someone else - it strayed me into six months of complete depression. I was a burnout. I think most of you, being a subscriber to this subreddit know the drill of post-trauma depression. Everything was lost, life is senseless onward, without her, I won't ever find anyone with whom I won't feel so fucking lonely as I am basically whole my life. 

So those were my days of yet another hell. I cried every morning because I didn't want to be conscious at all. Every activity became hollow. Eating, basic hygiene, getting out of bed were unreachable tasks. I just lied there for a month, basically not moving out of bed unless for drinking with friends. It was the beginning of my unconnectivity with this world, with this life. You know that feeling, common for me when I'm high, when you're watching a movie and you just can't not see that they are all actors? You are unable to immerse yourself into the movie, so was I unable to immerse myself into this life, this world, this reality. Well, that's the feeling that will stay with me forever I guess, since when you gaze into the void once, you will never be unaware of its presence again. I tried different jobs, tried self-harming, tried antidepressants, tried to wait it out. So I just waited. Similarly to my first break up, with M, I just lied down on the waves and checked when they will throw me. Started a job as a programmer, so I had something to do with my life (honestly, a regular life schedule, 9-17, going to sleep at 22-23 is a great helper, it's of course far from enough but it helps, at least helped me a little).

Oh, did I mention that we still didn't lose contact with R? Yea. That's just us. But this time I was in her shoes, we switched sides as now I was hurting from break up and she didn't want to lose me as a friend or just a person in life but she went straight into this other guy's arms. Welp it hurt. Welp, I earned this. And now I finally know what hell I've put her into last year. It was also the first time for me when I was unable to get what I wanted the most. You know that maybe, feeling of crushing helplessness, knowing that this is the end and we will never be the same, happy couple we were in our first iteration (thanks to you, you fucking asshole). 

And again, time did what it can do best - it flew. 

And I met A. 

This is becoming pretty long so if you're still here I admire your strong will and thank you for sacrificing your time. 

I met A. A came to my life through a friend of mine, he met her on tinder, they went on a date, haven't liked each other romantic-wise but became friends. She was invited into our environment. And then we clicked. We were both depressed back then, she was on her medication, I was in a recovery. We were both post break up from a harsh relationship. Had similar backgrounds, liked each other. Connected pretty well. So we fall for ourselves. We both knew that we're still recovering from our last partners, we knew about our burden but we just accepted it as it was, willing to try work it out without any hard feelings, just to see if this will play right. And it played right. We were a sweet couple, maybe too sweet to some of your taste. Quickly fell in love, spent our days together, joking about being together forever ( I'm twenty four, she's twenty two so childishly as hell), having a family, bleh bleh. A is a really sweet and loving girl, she had a troubled life and she wanted stability, just a normal, good ol', stable relationship. So did I. And I really mean it, I am past over pulling two magpies, cheating, all this chaos. I wanted to be normal, to have a happy relationship. She said that she will show me what a normal relationship means. And I wanted the same for her. And I loved her. I love her. ""I love you"" - were the words that I heard two weeks ago from R. ""I still love you"" to be strict. But I managed to be over R. Or I convinced myself enough to be okay with it to not destroy another relationship for her sake. But it hurt me so bad because I wanted her to be happy, I wanted her to finally be over me, to forget about this thrash person who hurt her so bad I am so she could finally find her peace. I also never told her that I am in a new relationship because, first, that was something we agreed upon during our last break up, I don't wanna know, you won't know so we won't have to suffer. I made as little contact with R as I did, yet still didn't want to lost it completely because I like this human(love?) very much and she was reaching out for me so I just couldn't bear to ghost her. (Which is maybe the best thing to do for her). 

But coming back to A - she was way out of my league, at least in my opinion. She's gorgeous, your typical beauty, fully aware of her attractiveness. It was a huge shock for me that a girl like her could me interested in someone like me. Depressed little cunt, with a huge emotional burden, low self-esteem and lacking in social skills. So, the thing that happened today, as I am writing this, was anticipated by me both ways - firstly, I felt that I'm not enough for her, of course I didn't show it a bit (remember, be a MAN) and, after an introspective analyze, I think that half-conciously I was hoping for it a little so I could be with R at last. (During her confession from two weeks ago she said that she always thought that this would be a happy end for us, after all that chaos and hell we will finally meet on the way).

So what happened today was that I put another brick to my wall of shame and bad features. Last night she went for a girls-out with her buddy, drunk a lot and came back to her apartment with aforementioned unhealed ex-boyfriend. I wouldn't ever know if I wouldn't checked on her phone (I know, thrash, thrasher, me). Well, I am not this type of a guy who checks on his partners phone on a daily basis but I accidentally overlooked one message from her buddy saying - ""let's hope 'my name' will never know"" so my curiosity take the worst of me and I did it and discovered her deed. After confronting her about it, first she turned red, her eyes turned big as suns and went into full denial, then she told that she's mad about me checking her phone, to which she has every right, and then, finally, admitted. From what she says, they haven't had sex, just slept together in an underwear but, honestly, it doesn't really matter, does it? 

Off. That was a journey. So here I am, writing this, completely not knowing what to do. Should I break up with her, should I confess everything above to R and let her decide if she still wants me(because I do)? Should I lost contact with both of them for the sake of us all? 

I am a messy, bad person, with troubled and fucked up personality, who did awful things, is very sorry about it, don't wanting to hurt any more single person in my miserable and unworthy life and I don't know what to do. Hence, my confession.

Thank you.",12Feb2019,1
97,"Ever since I was a kid, according to my parents, and a lot of pictures, show that I had a ""good"" childhood, going to the zoo, making friends etc. . I cannot remember anything about it, except of some broken images which are just traumatic experiences. But this is not where it stops, these last years, since... I don't even know when; I keep forgetting more and more things. Whether those are places, names, experiences, food, or even what I ate and what I did in school! That happens as often as week per week, or after 2 days. I don't know what it is... And I am honestly dying to know what it is. It sucks feeling like you just popped out here with just a few memories of a lonely kid who cried more than laughing.

I’m constantly on edge when I’m alone, ready to defend myself if some unseen threat were to pounce. I’m constantly checking over my shoulder, jumping at every noise and scanning rooms I go into when I’m alone. I hate this. I’m not superstitious but the best way I can describe this is a ghost constantly following and tormenting me when I’m alone. Can anyone give advice?

104,"I'm honestly so confused with life now considering how there's literally pros and cons of autism. Some people say autism is a beautiful thing while others say it's very harmful. In case anyone doesn't know what I mean, I mean if we should all strive to be autistic in the first place. Some think we should because some autists are known to be highly intelligent and artistic in certain areas. Others think we should not at all because there's some autists out there (a very small but vocal group) who are known to be violent, selfish, unintelligent and whiny (it's mainly people like Chris Chan and others who keep making autists look very bad). So should we strive or not? Are there really more bad effects of autism than there are good effects? And if there are more bad effects then that's something we really should work on because we really don't wanna normalize something that could cause more harm. I'm just saying.

It should be noted that I am in fact autistic but I'm just gonna say that I don't know anymore. I really don't because I don't know how to feel about my disorder. I don't know if I should feel proud or ashamed of it anyway. But I do know that I don't try to let it define me by any means because disorders shouldn't define you. Only you as a person defines who you are. That's the most important thing to know.

Sorry if I'm sounding all worried. It's just that I kinda am because truth be told, I'm a little nervous about going out in public because I am worried that people would stereotype me as some mentally challenged lost cause who's harmful to society.

111,"Hey guys I need some help. I’ve had some issues for a while and I don’t know what it is. But here’s the background story which I think is connected to it. 

So my first girlfriend (now ex) I’m convinced was from hell. It was my first exposure to falling in love and romance etc. well at the peak of our relationship she cheated on me. Multiple times. It fucked my head but she said she was gonna kill herself of the guilt so I gave her another chance. Anyways this relationship lasted two years and it was the worst. She borderline raped me, beat me often, at one point she tried to get me to kill myself and it almost worked. After she cheated on me again, she dumped me then accused me of rape as an attempt to put me in jail. I’ll admit I wasn’t very good to her but I was nowhere on her level. To say the least I’m a bit screwed up. 

Anyways I’ve always had anxiety and I’m not depressed anymore but I’m very sensitive to the topic of cheating. If I read any stories on reddit involving cheating, or any shows with cheating in it I get stuck in this distant, emotionless mood for 1-3 days after. And I have a new girlfriend now and I’m absolutely terrified of getting cheated on again. Over the past year or so I’ve been having these freezing episodes (happens mostly when I’m with my gf) where I basically freeze up, my mind is blank and I turn emotionless for up to ten minutes and I don’t want to be touched or talked to. It’s a little scary but I wouldn’t say it’s extremely awful or anything. I just want to know what this is. I do believe it has to do with my past and I’m considering seeing a doctor about this and it’s been bothering me but I just want answers. ",12Feb2019,1

By the time I do start to hit my head or pull on my hair or rip my clothing I don’t realize it, I am in an emotional surge. At this point I don’t remember the specifics of what we argue about. This time it was jabs about my depression, how I did absolutely nothing for some weeks, or how I wouldn’t get up and ready to go out into snow. I had been up hours earlier than him waiting for him to get up, and by then I’d grown sleepy again. That I’m somehow always ruining something he wants to go out and do by being too tired. I wanted to sleep for a few moments more because I had been up waiting all morning. I tried to wake him up but it was my fault for not trying harder. I have to “really” wake him up.

I’m normally not this volatile at all... I’m generally a quiet person, non confrontational and I keep to myself. I’m more likely to suffer in silence. But when I argue with my SO, something just goes off in my head. My voice raises to levels I didn’t think it could, I just sound like a screeching monster. Yet in the moment I can’t stop myself. He doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with me, just that I’m troubled emotionally. I’ve never acted this way with anyone else. 

I don’t have the heart to confide this to anyone else.. it’s not like me and they might think I’m crazy. I probably am. But I just wanted a second opinion, because to me this isn’t normal.

125,"I understand depression makes people isolate. Depressed people shut off and are numb to the advice that others give them. It’s as if depressed people want to resolve everything on their own. Then it gets a little contradictory. Depressed people want to alone like a hermit but also want the help from others. Depression makes us so numb that we begin to resent the help we are not paying attention to. But depression also makes us resent the help we want from others that we don’t receive. It’s so weird, hopefully you understand. As a depressed person, I am currently isolating myself from my friends and family. I’m starting to notice how I’m affecting the good relationships I have with good people. There are people who care about you. Please don’t isolate, say sorry for what you’ve been doing and tell them your struggles. Hopefully they’ll understand. ",12Feb2019,1

130,"So I am 16 years old boy and I have frequent nightmares. I don't know why that is tbh. I am diagnosed with a high associative memory (idk in English for sure) but it is that i associate a lot of thoughts with other thoughts in my head. I do ways feel like it's very busy in my head. I am not sure it's bc of that. But I can never really feel relaxed. I do smoke weed and then I feel relaxed but even then I sometimes have nightmares.

 I did feel pretty depressed for a while as well. From mid 15 to mid 16. I just recently got more control over it. Now I have some complaints or things but not as much as I used to. I do feel a lot better now. I like life more, do more, food started tasting better, I am enjoying things more, like social contact more. But that's just something I wanted to share bc I feel like it might be useful. 

I hope anyone can help me. I don't want to have bad dreams all the time. When I have dreams they are always unpleasant and could be considered nightmares. But I have frequent nightmares since 13 or something. I got pretty much used to it. They are almost never very jumpy. Like something scaring me or straight killing me or something. I don't shock wake up. But they are more unpleasant.

Dream of tonight.
I dreamed that a girl from my class I barely know was going to get put to death by doctors bc she has some sort of disease and she was going to get euthanized. I was with my friends in a room. Laughing and chilling out. Then I walked out of the room and at the end of the hall she was there. It was pretty dark so I only saw her silhouette. I walked up to her pretty fast bc I genuinely felt bad for her. I knew what was going on for some reason. Then I grabbed her by her hands and asked her if she really was going to die. She told me that she was going to die right after saying goodbye to me. Then she kissed me and walked away from me. Then I walked back to my friends and was really panicked and shocked and then It ended.

It really left me feeling sad, confused and simpathy. I have a lot of disturbing dreams but this was the one I dreamed tonight. ",12Feb2019,1

She simply cannot sleep, has lost a lot of her previous liveliness and is in so much pain. She has even developed some serious headaches in diagnosed by the dozen different doctors she's been too.

133,"Alright so this post is gonna be a wreck, but please hear me out. Okay so I’ve had quite a troubled past, parents are divorced, I was abused when I was younger, and my mom and brother both have depression, my brother is also heavily addicted to weed. But lately things are going better, I should be better. But since two or three years I’ve felt horrible, completely lost my creativity, dissociating from time to time. The last time I went to therapy was two years ago but I didn’t really understand what I was feeling back then so my problems got dismissed as being puberty-problems. But the feelings never went away, I’ve grown a lot since then, learned a lot, met a lot of really wise and cool people. 

But I keep feeling terrible, one moment I feel absolutely depressed and wanna die or feel incredibly anxious for no reason(this can last from a few days to a few weeks) and then I would randomly feel hyperactive agitated or extremely happy, for no reason, and sometimes after a depressive episode I wouldn’t feel anything at all.
And last month I reached out for help again. I told someone at my school what was wrong and if they could help me find professional help. But ever since then I’ve felt even worse I blame myself for feeling depressed and I feel like I talk myself into feeling bad, I keep thinking about what I’m gonna say when I go to therapy and how I want it to go, and that I don’t really want help because it’s all made up. It’s gotten to this point where I don’t know wether to believe those thoughts or not. I just don’t know anymore and I feel like I’m losing my mind, 

I keep forgetting things and get paranoid sometimes for no reason (I saw a couple of lights in the sky a few nights ago but they were so strange I was afraid it was aliens, so when I got home I had to close all the curtains in my home just to feel safe, I knew that what I was doing was crazy but I did it anyway). I’ve had a couple of these weird episodes, and they fade, but I am absolutely lost in my mind and got no idea wether I’m making stuff up for attention or if something is actually the matter. I just don’t know anymore, so if someone could tell me this is normal or not I’d be very thankful",12Feb2019,1

I walk by and am drawn over to the rail and then just look over it and contemplate jumping. Or I’m putting knives away after cleaning and hold one for a few minutes, thinking that I should stab myself or slit my wrists. I don’t feel overly suicidal but when thoughts like these happen, I sort of feel like it’s an out-of-body experience. Like it’s not me at all and following through on these things would be okay. 

Does anyone have thoughts like these? I haven’t dealt with stuff like this in years (I was diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder in 2013) but have been under major stress/huge life changes the past few months (mentally ill brother threatening to kill me, 7 yr relationship ending, etc) and so I am so anxious and sad lately.

138,"Hi all, my family has grown tired of my mental health issues. Comorbid anxiety and depression. They've taken this attitude that since I've been symptomatic and 'suffering' for 16 of my 24 years that I should just get over my problems at this point. ""We've given you all the money you need to fix your problems."" In reference to therapists. On experiencing panic attacks, ""You're trying to tug at my heart strings when you have your episodes, its happened too many times. Your the boy who cried wolf!"" Always pointing out that I am never happy. Particularly in where I'm living. I'm a trans woman and somewhat visible and have experienced more than my fair share of assholes yelling at me or threatening me while living in both small and large cities. This is the source of most of my anxiety, its brushed off, because it's simply not important. ""Your going to find that everywhere, and this is going to happen to you for the rest of your life, learn to live with it."" whenever I try to bring things that are affecting me significantly, more often than not its met with a, ""What did you expect?"". I'm living in a less than desirable small town right now, theres lots of evidence signs of drug addiction and crime around my area condoms in the gutters, needles casually left about. People definitely tweaking on some bad shit always yelling at people. A shopping cart casually abandoned in the front lawn of the house I have an apartment in last night. My neighbors home was broken into by a man on dugs with a knife running from the police last weekened. This isn't a good place to live. I bring up to my family that I want to move to larger more lgbt friendly city and they all tell me, ""I don't think you'll ever be happy"". ""You don't seem to be happy anywhere you are."" ""You've got other problems that are making you unhappy"" ""It's a bad idea for you to move, you'll just be unhappy there"". Seems like theyre ""Done trying to fix you"". All the quotes have all been said to me by either my sisters or my parents. It's more than frustrating to have my concerns downplayed or brushed off. Any time I bring something difficult to them, theyll complain that I only bring them problems. Am I just a drain on my family?",12Feb2019,1

140,"Hi, I’m a 19 y/o guy from Canada and I‘m just really clueless how to deal with a good friend of mine (M/21) who clearly suffers from a mental illness. I don’t know what exactly he has and how to deal with it but I really worried and want to help but I absolutely don’t know how.

Generally, he often feels anxious and unhappy, lacks motivation, he‘s extremely self-critical and he often says that he feels worthless eventhough we (his group of friends) are always supportive in everything he does (maybe that’s not the way to go idk). He also often says that he wants to kill himself, at first it was clearly just a joke but now I think he really wants to kill himself. But most notable are his extreme mood swings and lately the desire to isolate himself. 

He often makes plans with us just to cancle everything just hours before. Then we always try to talk him into doing the planned activity because we know that he actually really wants this and most of the time it works. 

Now what really made me worried was that he wrote us that he doesn’t want to anything anymore for the next couple of months and that we shouldn’t invite him to anything because he isolate himself. 

I don’t know why but I guess this is a way to punish himself for some reason. He just likes to do that and often said he doesn’t want to have fun with us because he didn’t deserve it. I’m just so speechless. I can’t understand from where this self-hatred comes from. I know that he lost someone dear when he was a child and he once said that he felt guilty about his death but afaik it wasn’t his fault at all, so why does he hate himself so much?

When I ask him about how he feels he just says that he is anxious about his future but this just doesn’t make sense. Like, I believe him when he says that but I just think there is an underlying problem about which he isn’t 100% honest with me. 

I don’t know what to do. I want him to feel better because I want to help him and because he drags me down too with his mood especially because I’m also mentally ill however I can deal with it somewhat ok but he just seems like he’s about to do something stupid. I don’t know how to talk to him eventhough I know where he’s coming from.

153," Because of the situation outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/apm6fs/elongated_sigh_rant/), I am questioning whether my mother is an abuser and if I am a victim. Whilst I recognise that I have been on the receiving end of emotional abuse numerous times throughout my relationship with my mother, the other day was a collection of several emotional abuse tactics. Throughout my relationship the abuse has not been something that is constant but rather something that happens when I talk about the things she’s (or in this case, her mother) said/done that have hurt me. Or it also occurs when I talk about my feelings/pain (regardless of who caused it). 

The tactics she uses include: deflection/trying to turn it back on me, saying she cannot remember the event in question or flat out denying it happened; frequently dismissing, devaluing and undermining my feelings or saying that I’m oversensitive; calling me ‘stupid child’ or saying something I’ve done is stupid (usually when she’s angry because of a mistake I’ve made or something I’ve done). 

And even though it seems like I’ve answered my question whilst writing this, accusing someone of abuse is a very serious accusation. Thus I want to be completely sure this is abuse. 

Is she an abuser? Am I an abuse victim? Can someone use occasionally use abusive tactics but not be an abuser? Can someone be a victim of abuse without being an abuse victim? What advice do you have for me (other than talking to her since that’s clearly a dead end)?",12Feb2019,1

156,"I’ve done all the things within my power to “get better”. Dealing with anxiety and depression but have not had them formally diagnosed. Just over a year ago I quit drinking, which is the only drug I used, got in touch with a therapist who i see every couple weeks, have used all the mental exercises that I feel help, have strengthened all the positive relationships in my life along with becoming involved in the healthiest romantic relationship thus far. Plus, I’ve always maintained pretty good diet and exercise habits. With all of this, I still find myself constantly fighting intrusive thoughts that sometimes become suicidal ideations, exhaustion, a little bit of paranoia, time being distorted, ruminating and huge amounts of anxiety that have only gotten worse and even had my first panic attack in almost 10 years last week. 

Since I have done all of that work and still feel this way, it’s probably time to seek some sort of help that may include medication. The problem is that I deal with doctors so little and especially when it comes to psychiatrists (or whichever is a medical doctor) that it’s intimidating. I’ve tried a couple of times but, thanks to anxiety, I get overwhelmed and feels as if the paths I’m led down are a little over complicated and being taken advantage of, thanks paranoia.

157,"A little about me. I'm going on 30. I work in an office.  I am an emotional guy (internally). Introverted. I'm either very quiet or very excited. I grew up in one of those ""men don't talk about their feelings"" environments.

About 4 years ago I got sober. I carried a lot of shame and guilt around for a number of reasons, some real, some not so much. I spent about a decade numbing those feelings with drugs and alcohol. Then I went to treatment, sobered up, and got into the St. Paul, MN sober community where I remained for about 3 years. I'm out on my own now. I don't really do meetings anymore, and I don't feel drawn towards the same bad habits I used to have. Being sober was the healthiest choice I made in a long time, but it was a bit of a double edged sword because now I have to feel again. Not that that is a bad thing. The hard part is dealing with those feelings sometimes.

I am not a psychiatrist or a doctor, but I do believe I suffer from some sort of depression. I used to have a lot of people around me to talk to about these things (when I was closer to the sober community), but now I am out on my own trying to build a life out of the rubble of my previous one. On the surface, everything looks okay. I have a full time job, health insurance, a car, I pay my bills, I cook my own food, I rent my own place, I exercise. But I am constantly nagged by this deep sadness. It isn't all day every day, but when it hits me it is like a truck. I just don't want to do anything or talk to anyone. I feel like a sad vegetable rooted to my couch playing video games or watching Netflix. I feel it in my chest. My mind runs all over the place. I feel like my life is slipping out of my grasp. I stress over nothing. I know its all in my head but I can't stop it when it gets into full swing.

 I see a lot of people talking online about mental health these days saying ""just talk to someone"". So here I am I guess.

I am debating on seeking therapy, but I don't want to just be prescribed medication. Half of my addiction was because I abused prescriptions. So that is just not a valid option in my mind.

162,"As a background, my childhood has definitely not helped my situation. I have had parents who were very demanding of success from me from a young age. This made me afraid of failure and disappointing people. From the ages of 11 to 16 I have received consistent bullying that has ranged from verbal to physical abuse over the way i look. I have always been nerdy, but during my youth I also had glasses and braces which really didn't help me out. I was always called repulsive and useless which didn't effect me so much at the time, but has since created deep insecurities within me.

At the time of writing this, I am 18 and have almost no confidence. It is now engrained in my head that I am repulsive and almost useless. The only way my confidence is ever raised is through compliments, as if someone calls me something positive (which is extremely rare) it assures me momentarily that my insecurities of being ugly and good for nothing are false. However, my lack of social presence and growing loneliness has meant that most of my interactions with people are negative for me. I struggle to make new friends as the bullying has made me presume people don't want to hang out with me, as if I am almost a burden on them by simply being present. The lack of good friends, girlfriends and supportive parents means no one in my life supports me and assures me in a way that comforts me and my mind. I now spend almost all evenings playing games consoles i dont enjoy, as i just need something I can embrace that takes my mind off of my constant feelings of stress and insecurity. 

As I continue to get older, the stress in my life to succeed during exams and other stressful experiences increase, I fear I will reach an even lower low, and I honestly don't want to know what that looks and feels like. I haven't opened up about this before, and I suppose me doing this here and now is a final search for relief. I expect no one to read this, but if anyone does find the time to embrace my problems, any advice for how I can rebuild my confidence will be appreciated extremely. Thanks for taking the time.",12Feb2019,1
163,"I live in the US, California

I am diagnosed with schizoaffective and I checked a [research study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171213130504.htm) about the possibility of having a immune disorder causing the illness. How can I approach this to my doctor? 

I also had a bad greenish infection scab in my scalp when I was in highschool that covered a large spot in my head but my scars healed. I was thinking of the possibility that I want a head scan for it.

It’s either one of those. All this time I have a gut feeling that my illness isn’t permanent, and that it can be fixed. I know it may be wrong but I can’t ignore the gut feeling. Thank you for respecting my decision to look for more treatment options since I feel there’s something wrong with my current treatment.",12Feb2019,1

165,"I have been feeling terrible for quite some time now. I don't have the determination or willpower to do anything. As a result I think I've lost all of the things about myself I used to pride myself on. I used to be so determined. I'd go to great lengths to do the things I wanted to do. Now when I have to do something I barely muster the will to do it. From simple daily activities like cleaning my room to something bigger like losing weight. I keep feeling like I am worthless and the voice in my head makes sure I remember it every time I do something negative for myself or others, or simply fail to do something I know I should (which seems to be most of the time). Even when I achieve something I don't really believe it is relevant. I have zero idea why the very few people who have been there for me and support me no matter what I want to do, actually keep showing up for me. I feel like they are wasting their time on me. I made a new friend this summer. The time I'd spend with her, I truly felt like myself again and as soon as I was left to think, the thoughts came pouring back- the confusion as to why she is willingly choosing to spend time with me, all the negative thoughts about myself. 

I really want to change my life and I would like to think I am trying my best but I am not even sure that's true. I have been hurting so much for so long that I whenever I have to do something that most people do daily without even thinking about, I just end up delaying doing it. I'm not even sure why that is. Part of me just wants to do nothing but lie in bed, sleep and eat. Another part of me wants to do anything that results in a strong enough emotion that I can't take my focus off of it because this way I can't think all the terrible thoughts that constantly go through my mind otherwise. A third just wants to give up on all and see what happens- worst case (not even sure if it's the worst, to be honest) I end up not being able to take it anymore and kill myself. 

I know that I am not doing everything I should to fix this and believe me when I say that I want this all to go away more than anyone, but whenever I think about actually doing these things I realize it's all pointless and go back to bed. I don't know if I need to do better, if I am just starting to feel comfortable (or more like content) with this state because I end up excusing myself for failing to do anything. To be objective, I feel like I've made some progress recently but I feel like I don't do enough and it is just fueling my negative thoughts which makes it more difficult to actually act. It is so strange, I occasionally get these weird bursts of energy that last about a minute or few. I just want to feel like that more often than not. I am totally lost as to what to do. I keep going between I am doing my best and I am not doing enough and it is driving me crazy. 

There is something else that is kind of bothering me. More like it is not bothering me and this fact  is slightly bothering itself. I just want to stop hurting so much that I might do anything to make it stop. Last month I kept my leg right next to my electric heater knowing that I would burn myself. It was hurting and I just stood there because the sensation was strong enough to not allow me to really think about other things. Burning my leg was one of the best I had felt for some time. I walked around with bandages for a month and it still hasn't fully healed. What's next? I kind of know what but I don't really care about it too much, At least it will make it go away. I honestly don't know what to do.",12Feb2019,1

168,"I have been seeing psychiatrists for four years now and have previously been prescribed seroquel (regular and extended release), busparin, gabapentin, trazadone, lexapro (which I was on for the longest), and probably 2 or 3 others that I can’t think of right now. I am currently taking remeron - or mirtazapine - at 15mg and it was greatly helping my mood and with sleeping better, but has recently tapered off in the sleep department. So my doctor has suggested that I double the dose of remeron (as this can help with mood and anxiety even more) and add on prazosin; as I have night terrors and very high blood pressure as well. If this isn’t satisfactory, she has prescribed me with vistarol - or hydroxyzine - to add to the mix. I have been diagnosed with handfuls of different disorders but the labels that have stuck are: generalized and social anxiety disorders and panic disorder. I get 20-30 mg of Xanax a month for my anxiety. Also, without medication, because of these disorders, I don’t sleep at all at night and will usually get 3-4 hours during the day every few days. 
I’m wondering if anyone has words of encouragement, constructive criticism, advice, or stories on any of the topics I mentioned. ",12Feb2019,1
169,"I have a friend who has BPD and today at school she had an outburst of anger. I didn't know what to do and many other times I didn't know what to do/ what to say when se had ""bad"" beahviours and intense emotions out of nowhere. She also has risky behaviours such as drinking too much and too often, and having sex with everyone, also strangers. I just want to help her and know what are the right things to do with her cause she's clearly not happy about her situation. I also don't know many things about this disorder to be honest, aside for some things I read on the internet. Does soneone have any advice or some informations about BPD?

170,"2018 was the worst, yet best year for me, and it seems 2019 follow in the same vein. Because I have started standing up for myself, make my own choices, and taken my own mental health serious,  I have been able to cut out some terrible people from life and surround myself with nice ones. I even got a bf, and I actually really really like him. 

 Despite all this my depression is not loosening it's grip, and honestly I think about dying far more often now than I ever did before. The situation have to be right as I want the least ammount of work on others, and it was so so close. I had a plan, a way, a time, and then the situation went and changed on me last minute, so now all that is out the window. I told my therapist and they suggested a voluntarily admission, which I kinda agree with, but also I am so ""busy""  for at least a couple weeks now so I dunno what to tell them. I also don't know how to tell the bf/family. For now they are happy with check-ins twice a week. I don't even know what it involves tbh to be admitted, they promised it was a nice place but I dunno. I think it will be good for me, but I am also scared they will realize just how bad it is (I suspect I might have some heavy OCD tendencies that does not mash well with the depression and social anxiety, and I have been able to hide it for the last 10years, so kinda prefer it safely hidden away) 

Any experience if it's a good/bad idea? Also any idea dor lengt of stay? I've been depressed for 20 years so I doubt it is solved over a weekend. I have been able to battle it off for many years, but the reality is starting to hit and it tells me I won't be able to win this battle if I go about it like I have. I also live in Norway so no need to worry about costs and all that, I have also been out of a job for nearly 2 years due to the depression, so that won't be an issue. I am more worried about the experience as it seems so invasive/scary. ",12Feb2019,1
171,"So I have frequent nightmare for over 3 years now. I dream about 3 times a week and they are always unpleasant or bad dreams. They used to wake me up but don't really anymore. Sometimes but I think I just got used to having nightmares every so often. Today I had a pretty bad one, it messed up my whole day. This isn't the first time I had that by far.

Because I don't think I'm depressed, but I'm not doing too good.


Within four months:

-My mother died

-I was robbed, beaten and pistol whipped by two men. One still has not been captured.

-I came out as transgender. This is not bad in and of itself but the stress of being in the wrong body is constant.

-My best friend assaulted me.

-I was laid off.

-I lost my home.


I'm just down. I'm trying to stay strong, but the hits just keep coming. They just keep coming. I can't describe how I feel about myself. I'm hurt. I want to break down, but I can't. I swear to God I'm trying to be strong, but it's hard.

175,"The other night I was having a conversation with my Mum, and we were asking each other questions like ""What's your most and least favourite physical thing about how you look?"" and so on, when she asked me ""What do you think is your best and worst quality?"". And I had to think for a bit. Plenty of answers for what my worst attribute was, and none for my best. So I told her ""I think my worst quality is that I'm inherently unlikable. There's just something about me that people don't like, and that's why I've never really made any friends. I'm like an olive; I'm an acquired taste but people don't want to try more than once"". 

I've always been different, I was put into testing for Asperger's when I was 2 (pulled out of testing during the autism-vaccine scare though because my parents didn't want me to be ""labelled"", so I haven't got any official diagnosis), and over the years it's become more apparent that there's more differences between me and your average person, enough that a doctor could probably diagnose me with more than just Asperger's. I've grown up feeling like no matter how much I try there's just something wrong with me and everyone can tell.

With this in mind my Mum was quiet for a couple of moments before she says ""I think your best quality is that you're a very loving person, and your worst quality is your nervousness. I don't think you being different is a bad quality at all, but rather a failing on other people's parts. People fear what they don't understand, and they don't understand you. You're not inherently unlikable, you just haven't met the right people yet who will take the time to get to know you"".

I wanted to share that because I really needed it to be said for me, for someone to tell me that there isn't a flaw in who I am and that I'm okay the way I am. Thought I should share because the sentiment is true of everybody; You might be different but different isn't wrong.",12Feb2019,1
