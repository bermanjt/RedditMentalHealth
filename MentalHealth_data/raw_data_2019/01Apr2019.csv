0,"I dont know if its just my experience or if its everyone that gets treated like this, but people always act like im just a terrible or a drug addict for being depressed or anxious when they think i have no reason to be. If i dont want to talk to people im ""being a dick"" if im angry and want to be left aline im ""pretending to be a 'badass'"" (which as an accusation just disgusts me, and tells me everything i need to know about the accusing person to know i hate them with all of my being), if im anxious or de-personalizing im just a ""high"" or ""a drug addict"", where i live specifically people like to use the term ""crack head"" (mostly used by people who dont know what crack or crackheads actually are, but like to pretend to be morally superior). I feel like im being attacked for not fitting i to the mold or being a carbon copy of what people think is normal. Does anyone else get treated like shit for not being as happy or outgoing as people say/think they should be?",01Apr2019,19
1,"I don’t want to share numbers in here but all I’m going to say is that I lost weight in the second half of 2018 and have continued to lose a bit of weight since January. I started going to a gym now and I was asked if I had trouble with eating and that I am underweight for my height (I’m a guy, 177 cm or around 5ft 10?). I’m on a journey to regain muscle mass because I realized that what I thought was fat in my body was actually loose skin (I used to be just overweight and I don’t know, my body just isn’t tight at all, lol) and also just a big hipbone (which isn’t that big but my mind makes it seem enormous), and that my body fat percentage is actually very low.

3 years ago, this would’ve been the dream scenario for me. “I need to gain weight? I get to eat as much as I want!” But today it’s a really scary thought because I associate weight gain with being miserable again like I was throughout all my life when I got bullied at school and later when I was very depressed in 2017 and the first half of 2018. I’m well aware of this fear being irrational and I’m working on it with my therapy but it’s so hard to not think about calories and fat and weight and the scale, that goddamn scale.

I needed to vent. I’m scared and I know my weight hasn’t gone up and that it actually got lower because I think I’m eating enough, or at least enough to not freak out but apparently it’s not enough to get to my goal. I need to gain muscle mass and a bit of body fat, I really do know that but I’m scared.

Thanks for your time",01Apr2019,1
2,"Hello, Reddit. I have a problem: I can't force myself to do anything useful for my future, even to do things I have to do as a university student. I just waste my time on any kind of entertainment: games, social media, shows, friends etc, basically, everything that I can get pleasure from without actually trying hard. I can't seem to be scared of being expelled because I don't do my job as a student properly, like ""everything will be fine either way"". I'm anxious because I'm aware that it is not the right way of thinking. Sometimes my anxiety takes over and i get a huge boost of motivation and become productive for a few days but it ends up even worse with me wasting a lot more time laying in bed afterwards, like I'm trying to compensate for these days, I feel like highly addictied to dopamine and I can't do much about it. Sometimes I'd prefer hanging out with friends instead of going to an important exam. Thinking about it now makes me sick, but I'm sure that I would find an excuse for me to do it next time. I study IT and i genuinely enjoy doing programming, until i get hands on those entertainment things. The same goes for my hobbies, I like music, art, design, and were so happy doing it on my rare highly motivated moods to the fullest, wish it would never end, just imagining being highly motivated . I want to stop to live ""at the current moment"" and consider my future when i make decisions. I want to get rid of procrastination and addiction and live a normal life. I've been this way since around middle school and I'm trying to fight it for years and already tried many many things with no result. It's destroying my life at this point. That's why I'm here, asking for your help.

I'm 18, male, I don't do drugs, smoke or drink alcohol and never did, also don't want to, glad that at least I could keep myself from doing that.

5,"I know i got myself into commenting when i didn't have to. Probably shouldnt have. But on YouTube, there was a video about a girl who stabbed her baby when she was 15. She did something absolutely terrible. Unforgiveable. She deserves her prison statement. But i couldn't help but feel sympathic by the way she related the story. She may have been lying to get sympathy, that's true, but her story is plausible.

Everyone was calling her a monster. Psycho. Evil. A faker for her guilt.  And the thing was, hearing her story and keeping her age in mind, I dont think she's a horrible person, just a scared, traumatized girl at the time, who didn't know what to do. And people were talking about how it didn't make sense what she was saying about her reasons at the time, and i just think to myself that the commenters don't understand trauma and how trauma works. How irrational you can become in panic and shock, fear, guilt, shame, emotional torture. There's been times when I've nearly killed myself for all of those emotions raging all at once.

I couldn't help but comment when someone said it didn't make sense to end pain by inflicting pain. As a self-harmer and a previously suicidal person, i couldn't let that slide. 

Anyway, a rant. And if anyone could understand the messed up rationale that is mental health disorders and trauma, i thought it would be here.

And please, if you disagree, please be polite about it. I just needed a rant because its not worth going into a commenting war on the video and i needed a release.

Thank you guys.",01Apr2019,3

It's not like they don't have access (their college provides free counseling) but they keep talking themself out of going to appointments when they make them.

11,I’m getting to my fiancé his 38 male. I know him for about a year now but his nuts! At first when I meet him he would take me to the movies to restaurants to concerts and to new places. The first month was amazing I was in love after in the summer of 2018 it was hell. He would scream for everything he would drink 24/7 and not sleep he would break glass bottles break his phone and other things he insults me daily. During the fall it got better he stop throwing glass bottles and got less jealous. Now present day I made him get me a condo in downtown Austin  quit working and just enjoy life. His better he doesn’t drink allot anymore he doesn’t get physical now. And his chiller. But his constantly screaming for anything.  He acts like a baby and when I call him out on his bs he breaks down and cry’s. He has a problem idk what it is but he has a mental problem. Now for every little thing he wants to scream cuss me out and act like a baby and if I say something like “hey I didn’t do anything to you” he acts like the victim and starts to cry. But whenever his screaming and cussing me out and I start to cry he acts all tuff and just screams louder. I’m so embarrassed now by my neighbors living up and below me. I’m not a cruel person sometimes he gets me so piss off that I wanna beat him but I remind myself let it go his looney let it go. So basically when I defend myself and call out his bs he stops and cry’s but when I cry he gets more tuff is like if he wants me to be mean to him. His testing all my nerves. I’m a nice person.

linen and polyester webs cover my doubts
my mind wanders aimlessly, trying to fixate on how to care

14,"Hi everyone

First time poster here and sorry if I've got the wrong sub, I'm also new to Reddit :) 

I'm hoping to get some insight into reaching a diagnosis. Is there anyone here who might be able to look at my case history and give me an idea of what I should be pursuing? I've been seeing psychiatrists for awhile now and I'm not really any closer to diagnosis. I've been told I exhibit traits of a few disorders but nothing concrete (BPD, OCD, PMDD, ADHD - among others). I'll write a general history but I'm a very open person so I'm happy to answer any questions.

Maternal family history (paternal history unknown): 
      - mother diagnosed with OCD, GAD, (previously) somatoform disorder, bipolar 1 and possible autism spectrum and/or ADHD (diagnosis received late in life and no neurological testing has been pursued)
       - Brother diagnosed GAD and MDD
       - Multiple family members diagnosed with bipolar disorder, 2 schizophrenia 
       - Addictions common throughout the generations 
       - long history of intergenerational trauma

My history
       - cannabis user for 3 years currently 24yrs of age
       - long history of trauma starting in childhood, PTSD misdiagnosed as adjustment disorder at 15 after another major trauma (re-occurring PTSD symptoms since, mainly controlled)
        - history of major depressive episodes starting from 11
        - history of self harm and suicidal ideation from 11 &gt;
        - no history of mania
        - poor executive functions (difficulty with task execution and completion, difficulties with micro processes, poor time management skills, poor organisation skills, slow decision making processes)
        - sensory issues (issues with fabrics, textures, lights and sounds. I find simple tasks like doing the dishes or shopping very difficult)
        - Intrusive thinking and cyclical ruminating from a young age (including violent intrusive thoughts (self not others) ) 
        - issues with anxiety and panic attacks
        - history of Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified 


Medication history
A variety of antidepressants, I respond best to SSRI's and SNRI's however I have severe withdrawals from SNRI's. 
Methylphenidate (ritalin), responds well to low dosages. High dosages cause anxiety issues. No euphoria or mania
Atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, responds well with a reduction in rumination, anxiety and better sleep out comes

I've done therapy for years (CBT, ACT, DBT, Narrative) and seen a few psychiatrists and no one can seems to decide what's wrong with me or what testing to try... so any insight would be much appreciated! And any suggestions of testing I should pursue. I've had difficulty accessing neuropsychiatric testing due to my cannabis usage but the executive function issues have been there since I was a child.

Thank you!

18,"Hey Reddit,
 
Currently in between a fairly significant rock and a hard place and could use any recommendations you might have...

High-level overview (TW: suicide)

Historical:
In my mid-twenties (2013) I finally reached out for help when I realized I had great benefits with an employer. My parents committed suicide (in 2006) and taking on the grave responsibility that came with having younger siblings to rear while I was a legal adult at 19 was a lot. Depression made it difficult to leave the bed or eat. Full-disclosure: parents didn’t do things “right,” — no resources were left behind after their deaths except a lot of pain. To make it work financially, I juggled FT Starbucks, a PT flower shop, and PT stocking shelves at Wal-Mart overnight for a few years, and then a corporate place gave me a chance as a leg-up. I didn’t do great in the new mom role to teenagers, but all of my siblings are alive and have high school diplomas to date. I digress.

From 2013-2017 I worked with psychologists and psychotherapists, and they put me through a barrage of medicinal cocktails. My doctor at the time had a difficult time discerning if I was living with Bipolar II or major depression+anxiety+PTSD because of how cyclical things were/but somehow managed stability unmedicated. Regardless, very small doses of two medications and bi-weekly therapy for years worked to level me out, and I miraculously ended up in a steady dream job, working hard, labeled as a leader in the community, etc. 

...Because I was doing stellar things, I was poached by a different company, and left my employer. All normal, career advancement stuff. Which in theory was good...until I lost my medical coverage, and costs for my medicine skyrocketed—this was in late 2017.

As soon as I couldn’t afford my medicine and the Rx was out, it was like I hit the accelerator and drove off a cliff. With the new job, I didn’t have time built up to take FMLA or even enough sick time to deal with my mental breakdown. Lost that job due to needing the time off. I drained my savings to move for another new job. 

All-in-all, no decisions I made allowed me to affordable my obtain my medicine. I ended up homeless.

Present:
2018 was terrible. I was literally at the mercy of others (my siblings aren’t in any way shape or form able to help me and dealing with their own demons), and the only thing that kept me clawing at the lid of a coffin was a MacBook Pro and free WiFi. Someone threw me the bone of putting together a site for a non-profit (design/build/etc.) using my portfolio of work; word of mouth saw a few more jobs freelance jobs come along. An acquaintance was kind enough to let me live in their basement for three months to keep me out of the women’s shelters while I steamrolled more marketing for small businesses, and I finally was able to pull myself together enough to buy a second-hand blazer and land a full-time job. 

Here’s what I have:
A (sh-t) job and I live in a (sh-tty) apartment, but I have a check coming in this Friday and a pillow for my head. Some food for the week is in the fridge. My clothes are clean. Internet to send this post out. My trusty MacBook. Smart as a whip. Sobriety* (I’ve never touched anything illegal after watching what it did to my parents, and I don’t drink). *Side note: addiction is really tough on the mentally ill/homeless communities, and is a substantial barrier to them getting off the streets. I am working on being grateful for what I have. 

Lacking:
Benefits and access to affordable healthcare and medicine. 
I’ve done the research and there are no sliding scale resources available to me in the area. My income is just above poverty guidelines which disqualifies me from programs that can help. I can’t afford supplemental insurance. 

The problem:
I am sinking again — have legit been in bed for days and haven’t left the apartment. I did manage to take a shower before writing this which is a start... the depression is starting to take over again and I simply don’t know what to do. I’m trying to hang on because employment with benefits may be just around the corner. I met with the director of a University last week who is considering me for a two-year appointment. 

I’m looking for:
-Access to a medical professional that can Rx for Seroquel (Quetiapine) and Vistaril (Hydroxizine). These two helped significantly and I was on them for 24-months successfully. 
-Affordable generic Rx ideas domestically. I can handle about $100 per month. 
-I’d also appreciate any info on psychotherapy. Online resources simply haven’t worked. I’m having a difficult time adjusting to the “where I was” in the Golden Era to “where I am now,” sleeping on the floor of my studio apartment. Also, being aware of my network knowing that I’m mentally ill is difficult. Blacklisting professionally is illegal...but it doesn’t change anything. People talk. 

Thank you in advance. I’ll be posting this to a few other forums for any and all advice. I appreciate you.",01Apr2019,3

I saw a weird shadowy man walking towards me and then he disappeared. I am also having dizzy spells and fits of being completely convinced that I'm going to die.

I'm diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ptsd, chronic fatigue syndrome (hence the medication swap, the doctor was trying to target two things with one medication) and autism.

28,"I’ve (23M) been on and off with someone for 2 years. She (22F) has Bi-Polar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, and so our relationship has been very challenging for both of us, and her mental health has been a rollercoaster for both of us as well. Regardless, I am in love with her. In the time we’ve been together, I’ve seen her manic, I’ve seen her self-harm, I’ve found out she was sexting people online, I’ve thwarted some of her suicide attempts, and I’ve even helped saved her life by taking her to the ER after alcohol poisoning from drug interaction. After that last incident, and she came home from the hospital, we had a close relationship for months until she had ultimately broken up with me as she wanted to focus on her mental health and said she was worried she would just end up hurting me because she can’t have stable relationships. We had continued our friendship on a friend’s with benefits type of deal but we still acted and felt the exact same way about each other.

Today I discovered a blog where she was selling pictures of herself naked for money and confessing she’s doing the same types of drugs that almost lead to her dying. She’s been hiding it and lying about it when I would ask about it for months.

Despite all this, she is one of the most wonderful, beautiful and special people ever. I love her more than anything else that exists. I told her I knew about it over a phone call and she said “I can’t talk about this right now” and hung up. We still haven’t talked about it.

I’m very broken and I feel empty and sad and like I’ll never be able to help her or help her make the changes to her life and personality she desperately desires just like I do.

I know I ultimately have to try and maybe just cut ties with her, but she is my best friend despite her mental illnesses and impulses. We hang out and listen to music and talk about the world, and I would love to help her work through her problems and maybe even spend the rest of my life with her.

29,"My sister’s friends called me and said that my younger sister was trying to jump off the roof of a parking deck tonight. Thank god she was  restrained by the security guard, and was taken to the hospital via ambulance. They found oxy and percocet in her car. She’s stable right now, and does not want our parents to know for the moment, which I understand. My friends told me that for the last several weeks she hasn’t been leaving the house and she’s been reluctant to hang out with them.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to react when I come go see her tomorrow. I’ve had depression myself and some suicidal thoughts (which I’m on medication for) but I’ve never attempted.

How should I approach the situation when I see her tomorrow? Should I text her in the meantime? What should I do afterwards? I am so lost.

35,"I've (19yr male) been reading these posts for a little bit and I've come across many posts that reference something called BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). I researched it after finding a post discussing it and I have many symptoms that have been present in BPD victims. I feel a lot better but I will tell my story now.

&amp;#x200B;

I was always a kid who isolated myself. I had a childhood bully (my next door neighbor) and instead of going out to play with the other children I would isolate myself inside and play video games because video games obviously don't hurt you. I had a period of respite where I did have friends and the bullying died down a bit. However, I started highschool and decided that I was going to grow out my hair and donate it (started growing my hair out summer before sophomore year, I was 15). I was bullied constantly because of my long hair. I was called ugly and I was tormented every day. I went through a period of severe depression and had other friends who were going through it as well. I finally broke down at my cousin's wedding and I had basically an emotional breakdown where I was sobbing so hard I couldn't speak. I was 16 at the time and I had been isolating myself for many many months. The thing that hurt the most was that before this breakdown my own father used to tell me that I never smiled anymore. He knew something was wrong and so did my mother, yet they did absolutely nothing. My ""friends"" did the same thing. They sat around and looked on as I was tormented by another bully. I was so angry at my family and friends that I started lashingout at them, isolating myself further. I also began to develop an eating disorder where I would eat hoards of junk food and then feel horrible afterwareds. But I would never make myself throw up.  


Fast forward to junior year I finally cut my hair after 20 months of growing it out. I found a few friends over the summer leading into senior year and I began to get my life back together. Senior year was great and I had very few problems and excellent grades. Summer after senior year I found a girl that I loved and we've been dating ever since past July (around 9 months). I began my first college semester isolating myself and focusing on grades and not really doing a whole lot to make new friends. I finished with excellent grades though which is what I wanted. Then came the next semester. I went to a winter intercession course where I had to leave my family and friends and girlfriend early to come down to school and do a class. I was alone, I had absolutely no friends here because it was the winter and not suring regular semester, and I was thinking about bad things. I was all alone and I couldn't seem to figure out why I was there in the first place. My grades have dropped significantly as I am many weeks into the spring semester and there are ony about 5 more weeks left. I began to be a huge dick to my girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am paranoid that she is cheating on me, I see her fornicating with other men in visions and dreams and I get upset and confused. Now that I think about it it's almost like the scene in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 where Ron has to smash the locket with the sword of gryffindor (NERD PLUG SORRY BUT IF YOU LOOK UP THIS SCENE ITS ALMOST EACTLY WHAT GOES ON INSIDE MY HEAD). I have massive mood swings where she will reference an ex of hers or bring up another guy and I will have attacks of insecurity and I'll be really upset to where I begin to cry. I even have mood swings anyway where I'll just be sitting in my room and I'll all of the sudden think of something horrible and I'll just be upset. I have a problem with anger. I am not a violent person on the outside and I would never hurt a fly but I've had bouts here and there of angry and violent thoughts. I've been depressed too because I have been further isolating myself, and I think of humanity of a terrible plague on the earth and I don't trust a whole lot of people. I don't have very many friends and I am struggling with feeling loved or appreciated.  I have an extremely distorted view of self and almost feel out of body sometimes. more recently, I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and thoughts of beginning self harm. I have a lot of difficulty trusting people because of my past trauma and I think there's a whole lot of people who will upset me and not care, including my girlfriend. I have never really thought of myself as good enough to date her because she's pretty and smart and going to an IVY league colleg next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am struggling, my grades are slipping at a very fast rate. It is hard to focus, it is hard to trust, it is hard to make friends, it is hard to control my imagination as I think about all the horrible things that can come with being alive. I am very lost and I need help.

I apologize once again for the long post but I needed to tell my story. I want to get better and fast so I can resume a normal life. I am going to most likely seek professional help in the next week hopefully. If any of you have experienced these things please share how you overcame them. I bleieve this is BPD because the symptoms line up pretty well but is there anything else that this alligns with? How can I begin to feel better about myself, the surrounding world, my girlfriend, and my parents? I don't know what to do and I have nowhere else to turn. Every single day gets harder and harder. I'm anxious, I'm paranoid that the ones I love will abandon me or treat me wrong, and I am extremely sick mentally. Please someone help. Anything helps, even a small comment will help. How do I overcome this and does anyone have a similar story? if so, please share. I'd like to know I'm not so alone in the world.

37,"It all started going to my mates-friends house, I was so anti-drugs; I tried weed and was hooked since.

I 100% abused it, it was like the love of my life no matter how much I hated the taste of it; I adored the feeling. It went from a gram a week to taking days off to smoke up.

2 years has gone and I’ve gotten no-where in life, it was all about when I was next getting high. I had a carpet-fitting career then I stopped sleeping on certain-days and that really messed me up.

I still continued to smoke it until I started noticing changes, like I’m not my old-self. I lost spirituality in what I believe in, I lost my social-status. I lost money, I gained weight. I lost my brain in certain parts.

I believe all drugs effect you in different ways, but weed at first was like the best thing ever and it complimented my life, then I became “dependant” (I think). I’m just glad I stopped 2 years in.

I noticed working on a building site I’d feel “sketchy”, like maybe I said the wrong thing to one of the guys, that they can see through me and who I am, I’d feel slightly on-edge speaking to someone and when it was a 3-way convo I’d become irrelevant and if I was talking I may lose track of conversation, I’d lose train of thought so quickly. It’s like I forgot how to connect with people.

I miss my old self, I want to have the same drive as before but I can’t find it; I am not depressed, but I can relate. I’m just disappointed in myself.

Will my brain repair itself and go back to how it was? Around the same time as I started smoking I found a great burst of confidence and energy in my life I just felt so good, then weed took over my life, my friends, family and myself saw it coming. But like I said; I just want to go back to normal; over a month in I’m 100% feeling a difference BUT I know I’m not all there, just yet. I just need to know if I’ll find my bearings again. Because I miss it. I miss the old me.

39,"I've been reading a lot recently on techniques to cope with my OCD and I've found that many people recommend ""accepting uncertainty"" as a method to overcome OCD. However, according to the author of an article I just read, accepting uncertainty ""does not mean you make up in your mind its 50/50"", but that the probabilities sometimes are usually so low they are negligible and therefore he's more able to get over them, that the uncertainty is easier to accept with confidence. But what about when the matter at trial in obsessions and doubt is actually 50/50, or even more? How do you accept uncertainty in that case? Does it mean that because my doubts and obsessions are close to being 50 % or more that they're true? Does it mean that in that case there would be no excape?

I've also kind of been seriously obsessing with whether or not my recent obsessions are OCD or not, whether its a lifetime sentence and if I'll ever get over them, making it an obsession by itself and making the matters worse. Actually, I even think this article can be very misleading to people suffering from OCD where his ""it's not 50/50 so just get over it because the chances are close to null"" doesn't apply. Sometimes the odds are close, or at least it feels like they are. I feel the more articles I read on the internet the more confused I get about my obsessions, and the less hope I get from feeling better.

&amp;#x200B;

The quote I am referring to is the following:

&amp;#x200B;

""Accepting uncertainty does not mean accepting that there is a “1 out of 2” shot that your fear could be true.  What it means is you have abandoned the mandate to determine what the odds are in the first place.  As I write this, I am accepting the possibility, however small, that my computer is emitting some kind of toxic substance that may be giving me some kind of health issue.  I am further accepting that, merely by attending to writing this, I may be failing to attend to a more important matter, such as whether I may have committed some kind of crime earlier in the day.  To say these things is not to say that I believe these concerns are as likely to be true as a flip of the coin.  What I am saying is that the possibility simply exists at a level greater than absolute zero.  This allows for the understanding that the possibility may be so low, that I can treat it with such disinterest such that I refuse to even analyze *how* low the possibility is.

47,"Hi guys! I’m new here so if this doesn’t quite fit the guidelines or themes I’m happy to move to another sub :).

I have self diagnosed myself with mild-medium misophonia. Misophonia is a disorder that links the threat assessment part of the brain to the auditory processing part, causing fight/flight reactions and/or feelings of fear, violence, rage, panic and similar when a trigger sound is heard.

I’ve heard from a misophonic person here on reddit that they often have to run from the room, plug their ears desperately in order to focus and keep some sanity, and have trouble focusing whenever a trigger sound is heard.

So these are my symptoms: When I was younger I’d block my ears to concentrate when I heard a ‘bad sound’ (what I used to call trigger sounds) and would flinch away from bad sounds  and generally ask (if possible) for it to be stopped. ‘Bad sounds’ for me are any patternless, sharp, ‘pop’ or ‘crackles’. Other sounds include particular voices (I am aware that this may pertain to a different cause, regardless, reactions are the same, or even worse). Human sounds aside from speaking (scratching on skin, mouth sounds, chewing, etc) are extreme triggers for me.

I have never run from a room, or shouted, usually dealt with the feeling of ‘ew, argh, make it stop’ myself. I have left a dinner table early (I had finished but the expectation was that everybody remained until the last person finished) to escape the sounds, but only got as far as about 1 metre away before the host asked me where I was going. Not wanting to make it any more awkward, I stayed.

I recently got noise cancelling headphones and it improved this significantly, however it is considered rude to wear them in conversations/in class/when eating, so I can’t wear them often, and particularly in places where I feel they are most needed. In some situations I can’t have them around my neck, which comforts me in knowing they are close by. I don’t know what I’d do if I lost them.

I haven’t told anyone about it because I’m worried that my symptoms aren’t severe enough to warrant actually having this disorder. My parents may not find it severe enough to warrant a visit to a GP or likewise. Thankyou for reading this, and if I’m in the wrong place let me know! I’m happy to hear it :).

There are sometimes where I feel like I’m the happiest person in the world and others when I feel like all is hopeless and I might as well cut the cord. I might feel calm in relaxed one second but heated up and aggressive the next. And these happen with zero correlation to my surrounding environment. I have also had a very antisocial personality for a fairly long time. I tend to maintain a very neutral external behavior, so I don’t think my family and friends have caught on.

There have often been times where I think of suicide and self harm for various reasons. The part that scares me is most of these reasons aren’t based on negative events in my life, but most of the times just sheer curiosity, and this is a frequent thought.

51,"Hi, looking for your anecdotal input on whether this is/isn't hypomania and what you would do in my position.

Though I haven't had in one in at least a year, I think I might have just entered a hypomanic phase. During the day today I've been euphoric, but last night, and again tonight I've gotten super frustrated. There is an unmistakable feeling I get when I'm manic/hypomanic, and I feel it now --a nagging feeling that I MUST DO X, but not knowing what X is. It feels like a mental itch, which I cannot locate or identify, but has pushed me to the limits of my patience and drives me insane. It feels like pressure in my head and chest has built up to a boiling point, and I need to find some way to release it. I feel like I will have a heart attack unless I tear into something or am torn into. Inside my rib cage, the sun is barreling around my heart at a thousand rotations a minute. My instincts make me seek intense sensory and mental/emotional input as if it would somehow satisfy this ineffable want. It's harder not having a boyfriend to render me senseless.

Is this part of BD? The reasons I think it might not be hypomania is that I slept well last night and that it's only been a day. Another reason is that I've been able to keep it mostly in my head. I try to not bother people around me.

But, do many people get that special feeling? It's so strong. Do you also find that if you give into the voiceless thing telling you that you MUST DO SOMETHING, it makes you even more manic? Like, if you give into going for a walk instead of going to bed, instead of going to bed after the walk, you're going to want to go for a night drive to Monterey so you can wake up next to the sea, only to end up driving to Monterey, and throwing yourself into the ocean so it can eat you alive instead of sleeping in your car by the ocean?

54,"so i’m a female, 16. i’ve used marijuana maybe 18 times in the past 3 years, and i did psilocybin mushrooms one time in december, 2018. (2.5 grams of very potent shrooms, a.k.a. “a butt-load for the first time”).

i’ve always known i’ve had some general anxiety and just recently my mom and i self diagnosed me with OCD. My parents families have no history of schizophrenia or psychosis, although my fathers side has a history of dimentia as early as the age of 57.

i have always feared developing schizophrenia because my mother drilled into my head as a child that drugs specifically weed causes schizophrenia, and as i grew older i sort of forgot about it but my closest friend (since grade 1) has developed psychosis at age 15 (late 2017 because of chronic marijuana use since age of 14, he still uses and is now 16). he gets 1 or 2 20 minute episodes daily of hearing voices and his vision gets warped. ever Since i found out he had it i’ve been slightly worried that i might develop it, but ever since i did mushrooms, i haven’t been able to get the thought out of my head. Every day since i did them i’ve been over-researching the disease, trying to learn every single symptom and first sign, taking tests online and obsessing over it. I know i don’t have schizophrenia but i’m worried i might develop it if i have the odd smoke (weed) because i did mushrooms. I obsess over it so much to the point where if i’m thinking about it i start to see things, like a small movement in my peripheral vision, and i question whether or not what i see is real, i’ll be laying in bed and see somebody walking their dog out the window and i have to take a double-take to make sure it’s not fake, i haven’t heard a voice yet but i’m terrified that one moment a voice will pop into my head and from then on the disease will worsen to the point where i can’t control myself. I think this is because of OCD, as i can’t get the thoughts out of my head, i can not stop thinking about schizophrenia.

i know i don’t have schizophrenia and i don’t have a family history for it so it’s very unlikely for me to develop it but i’m looking for advice to help me stop these intrusive thoughts from bothering me daily, it’s getting to the point where it’s all i think about, i can barely focus in school anymore either. Also i want to just be able to have a small smoke once every 3-4 months without almost having a panic attack about developing schizophrenia/psychosis, that might seem immature or selfish but it helps me a lot, i have bad ADHD so it calms me down and sort of “resets” my brain i guess for when i’m very wired and stressed out.",01Apr2019,2

59,"Semi long post

Ok so at work, we have this thing every year. On New Year’s Day, we choose our One Word of the year to live by. Last year it was “learn”, this year I chose “appreciate.”

I have such a hard time showing appreciation for anybody. I have depression and anxiety and in the past had suicidal thoughts. I met a guy maybe 3 months after I broke up with my mentally manipulative and psychologically abusive ex who maxed out my credit cards. I was ready to end things once and for all but I couldn’t because I knew it would absolutely crush my family. I met this guy and we had a unique first meet at Whataburger. We had our first date a week or so later and went to see Captain America Civil War. I didn’t even like superhero movies. But I went. 

I found out he wasn’t well, mentally, and I wasn’t either. I think our mutual feeling of being ready to give up, connected us a little more and we both realized that we didn’t want to lose the other. We fought our inner demons together. 

That was about this time, 3 years ago. 

Dates passed, traditions were created and now here in 2 months we are about to celebrate our first year of marriage. 

He knows I appreciate him, I tell him daily, or try to at least but I just wanted to shout it to the world how much I appreciate him. Sounds lame, right? Whatever. 

I do still have my dark days, I know he does too, but this man has changed my life and I am so happy. He’s given me my life back and he’s given me back my old self that I missed so much. 

Sometimes it helps to have that one word so you can summarize your hopes and expectations to live by in that one little word. ",01Apr2019,1

61,"I've done some research on google on insomnia but can't really tell one way or the other if it applies to me. I'm on a waiting list to see a therapist. I can't ever fall asleep until dawn comes and it begins to get light outside. I try watching TV or reading to make myself tired but it never works (I know the light pollution from the TV can keep people awake, but it worked for me as a teen.) My mind is extremely active at night. I have racing thoughts starting at about 10 pm that go on until morning comes. It has been a problem since I was about 14. Pot and/or Alcohol have always helped but due to legal problems I have embraced sobriety. I am not sure whether it is stress-related (I am kind of a worry wart) or an actual issue. Whether I am stressed or not it always happens. Anyone able to provide any advice or tips?

P.S.
I have a history of mental health issues with a variety of diagnoses (bipolar 2, BPD, Depression, GAD) and have been on a variety of medications (Zoloft, Prozac, Buspar, Depakote, Trazadone, Seroquel, hydroxyzine, etc.) With no positive effect.

63,"So, me and my boyfriend have been together little over a year now. He has long drug backround and I did drugs little time when I met him. I wanted to stop and we almost broke up because of I didn't want to use anymore. He did stopp using drugs except weed.

I smoked weed every day for 7-8 months and I went in psychosis. I don't smoke it anymore. I have recently become aware that I have borderline personality disorder. My boyfriend may have that too or some kind of bipolar episodes. We have broken up two times now because of the weed. I said to him that I really don't want a parter who smokes weekly. He has said so many times that it's not going to be the case. Before we met, he had used weed every day for 5 years. 

He stopped using weed for couple of months to get his driver lisence back. After that he started using it againg and hasn't gone no longer than a week without it.

I have borderline episodes because of his smoking. He says that he smokes just because ""it's just fun to be high"". I can see that when he smokes, he becomes very passive and that remains several days after he has smoked. I kniw that he has mental health issues and it's not good for him to smoke and I think he doesn't realize how much weed affects him.

I become very angry and he becomes defensive and after every figth I just feel like killing myself (of course that is due to borderline).

I said it would be fine if he could smoke it like how normal people drink alcohol. In my opinion evem weekly is much. Am I being unreasonable here? I just can't go on like this anymore. I really want to be with him and I love him but his behaviour is triggering so much trauma and borderline episodes that I can't cope with everyday life. Help me. ",01Apr2019,1
64,"So I know this girl from ages, we have become closer in the last two years as we both went through a break up and we both needed someone to talk to as we both lived far away from our family. Not in the same country. 
In the interest of time I try to summarise, she has never done any training for diagnosing and she is mainly studying neuroscience and not psychology, never done an internship or shadowing people. Also she is from a richer background than mine and never really had to deal with problems regarding money or how to survive. I instead come from a rather average labouring family, I moved country on my own and tried to make a carrier through apprenticeship and low pay part time jobs. 
She has been keen on this because my therapist, who also is not qualified and is illegal for her to give a diagnose, mentioned the possibility of me having a disorder. You see that may be possible I don't deny it, although most of the times I feel depressed and this is since I was very young. I do my best to fight it and hide it but the truth is that I'm ashamed of a lot of my life choices and is not a great place to be. 
Now what bothers me is this constant need for her to say that she knows because she studied. We all due respect if you have been testing stuff on mice for the last two years and never specialist in psy logical therapy, knowing you are the only one I speak to because of time and work related issue wouldn't you think that you may have no point in having such opinion, as I mean you will not be able to be objective and also you don't have the training. So in effect she is a good friend but I feel that she should avoid imposing that I have a disorder etc because it doesn't help me at all. I just feel out casted and judged from someone who has always had a backup plan and never had to deal with the scary part of knowing that everything is on your shoulder. I since then spoken to my therapist again who has apologised and said that is not really within her remit and she just thinks I should get a ADHD scan due to the fact that most stuff about myself that makes me uncomfortable is very much related to a attention/hyper activism. So Reddit what do I do, leave her to believe I have a disorder or try to speak to her calmly about how I feel?

65,"I wondered how to properly discuss while having mental health issues.

I struggle with BPD, depression and several other mental illnesses and I observed that those around me, while having a discussion, react much calmer to certain points of view though having the same opinion as I do.     
For example: My fiancé told me two or so days ago that his co-worker, who is 33, is with an 18-yo. They live together and are dating for 3 years now. I was absolutely disgusted by that and strongly expressed it. While he shared my opinion, he seemed much calmer and way less bothered than I was. This happens with other people, too, so it doesn't really have to do with my fiancé nor the situation.     
Also please don't tell me I'm right about this one. I think I know I am, but that's not what it's about though. It's just a brief example. I guess I am what we laugh at in ""triggered!"" memes.

I really wish to have more understanding for opposite opinions. I always try to find an argument for it and suppress the urge to be right at all costs because it can quickly turn me into a hypocrite. I find it so hard to tell what bothers me in these arguments.

I'm male 25. I'm diagnosed:- autistic, social/separation anxiety and depression.

70,"Hey,

I am sorry if this is long - I just need to write. I'm in a serious, deep depressive episode and (for the first time) truly can't climb out. Life is an absolute nightmare.

I am F21 and am about 95% gay, but have always massively dissociated from my orientation. My family isn't homophobic but I have always *desperately* wanted to be straight. My deep emotional feelings for other girls have always been unwanted and traumatising. I decided to ""pretend to be straight"" at age 13, and this snowballed into a huge lie. I'd force myself to date guys that I wasn't interested in and cry myself to sleep. I became embittered, feeling sick to my stomach when I heard about straight weddings or love stories. Some of my friends were openly gay, and envy made me sick.

At 18, I told some close friends that I was ""slightly bi"". I went to college and told *all* new friends that I ""wasn't straight"". **Progress**, but still far from being *openly gay* or dating girls etc.*.* I still had to watch all my friends falling in love while not having the guts to pursue an authentic life for myself.

I met a girl this autumn, and fell madly in love with her and her powerful personality. We connect so, so deeply. I have amazing friends, but she sees right into my soul like no one has done before. I can't just fall for anyone - she's rare as hell. Her mind is sharp as a diamond. Well, she came into my life, shook me up and showed me a quality of living that I NEVER thought I'd experience, and then ended up back with her long-term ex-BF. We are now ""friends"", albeit with a clear romantic vibe between us because we connect on such a magical, soul level.

As may be clear, I'm a neurotic, obsessive person who is prone to [limerence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence). If you don't know what it's like, you won't be able to imagine it, but her emotional reciprocation is more addictive to me than crack, MDMA and heroin combined. I accept being ""friends"" with her, but a primitive, wounded part of me needs her emotionally like a baby needs its mother. I want total mental enmeshment. Zero boundaries. Even if we did date, I'd want her by my side 24/7. Totally unhealthy, totally anxious attachment issues.

Did I have a bad childhood or careless parents? Nope! I've always had a full, active life, with lots of friends, academic interests and hobbies. I just crave some people like they're drugs - it's my innate neurochemistry for sure, not just psychological.

I've always had **hypomanic tendencies** which I've used to my academic advantage, but this has recently developed into a full-blown mood disorder. I am currently in an intense depressive episode with intermittent hypomania. See, I believe that mental health conditions are ""states"" rather than labels that we ALWAYS carry. I am from a science background and believe bipolarity is, essentially, an inflammatory response to stressors. I think lying about my sexuality and getting into mental loops of despair, jealousy at straight people and dysphoria for so long has **made me mental.**

I feel like I have *learnt* how to trigger hypomania to get myself through my days in college. To et work done, chat to friends, do chores. Sometimes coffee will trigger it for me, but other times I just focus on grandiose thoughts like ""I'm clever and sociable!"" and the mood starts to rise in me. It allows me to *fuel my way* through the day, be loud, brazen, cocky and fun.

But, I **crash every night** and cry my eyes out for about 4 hours. Mainly about how madly in love I am with this girl, in the deepest, most authentic way. Her personality is just so riveting to me and i'll be forever settling. I don't fall easily - I've only had this feeling twice. I want to travel the world with her, and never stop learning from her and picking her fascinating brain. I also break down nightly over being queer, related sexuality issues, etc. Instead of helping, the crying makes my brain feel even more inflamed. I eventually fall asleep, wake up and repeat the cycle.

I am eating healthily AF, exercising, seeing lovely friends regularly, doing my academic work and doing a damn good job at being high-functioning. But I'm depressed, ideating suicide non-stop (I wouldn't act on it) and generally fucking mental.

I've tried nootropics like CBD oil, NAC, etc. and nothing helps. I'm very anti SSRIs and their dulling effects, but I'm tempted to try them as a last resort. However, I am such a perfectionist re: academics that I *can't ris*k being a less motivated, serotonin zombie. I know too much about the brain - I don't want to go on meds and lose my quirkiness, my ""glimmer"".

\---&gt; How does one escape a nightmare of a depressive episode like this, when nothing is helping? Is short-term medication necessary? Psychotherapy has helped anxiety but doesn't TOUCH my sexuality issues. And, being so deeply in love is impossible for me to deal with.",01Apr2019,1
71,"That's kinda true I guess, but what else should I do? The psychologist said I need a psychiatrist, then my first psychiatrist said I need a more experienced psychiatrist, the other psychiatrist said I need a therapist more than a psychiatrist, and the multiple therapists were mostly useless in treating gender dysphoria (I don't blame them, apparently it's not possible) and wouldn't understand why I don't want to live like a weirdo. I feel better with medication, it helps me be more stable and somehow stay alive, but it doesn't change my feelings about life and myself. I wanted to see if someone can change my opinion, but it didn't work. Apparently it's not going to get better. I'd be fine and completely content with checking out of life if it wouldn't have a negative impact on people around me, I care about my friends and family, that's why I'm still here. I have to improve my mental health so I don't break eventually, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do... I guess I kinda want a healthy mind while also simultaneously dissociating from my own inner feelings so they don't overwhelm me? This just seems impossible. I guess I can at least try to take more supplements and eat healthier.",01Apr2019,3

Not long ago I encouraged her in writing a book based on characters she was very excited telling me about and would often share pictures and poetry based on them.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she is constantly referring to her characters in real life.  She'll say something as a remark but it'll be based on her book and curse words she invented for her book, and every day she is constantly telling me about more and more about the characters and she'll refer to them later on in a conversation that has nothing to do with her book.

78,"I don’t even know where to begin...this might be pretty long, but to anyone that reads this, thank you. 
So, for the last 5-6 months I have been in this constant state of a low mood and have been stressed. It started with me being stressed about my future and place on this earth. You see, I’m in high school and around October 2018 I started to notice I was really nervous and would think a LOT about my future. I’m not saying this is out of the norm, just simply trying to find the beginning of all of this. So, shortly after, I started to slip with my schoolwork. I would go home and barely attempt any homework, which would lead me to cram anything I could get done in any free classes I had. I just could not focus on my schoolwork. I didn’t have the mental energy to put towards something I didn’t care about. However, previously I had always been a straight A student, so this was quite odd behavior. I figured I was just lazy and that I would get back on track soon enough (spoiler alert: I didn’t). 
I then started dating someone (broke up not that long after) which looking back on it, I probably just needed something to take my mind off of what was going on. It was then in this time that I felt waaaay more anxious and uncomfortable than usual. I also noticed how much I actually isolated myself and how emotionally closed off I am. Even now, I could spend hours in my room by myself. Not that I have people, but it’s so exhausting talking and just socializing with people. I get so anxious and can’t even have a proper conversation with anyone. I feel so awkward, even with my best friends. I also noticed how indecisive I am. I feel like I can’t do anything or make up my mind with anything I do without overthinking the outcome. Anyway, to continue, I went on a trip in December for winter break, and I would say this is when things really got worse and progressed more toward how I feel now. I was so physically and emotionally exhausted everyday. After getting back, I still wasn’t doing any of my work. During this time though, I thought I was just going through a burnout, but now I’m questioning if there’s actually anything wrong with me. 
These 5-6 months have the worst of my life for my mental health. I have had a history of some episodes in my life, but I was young so it didn’t seem like a big deal, just thought I was overreacting. Anyway, I’d like to add that my memory had been so bad. I can’t remember many details about these past months, other than how I have felt. I can’t even have a conversation without my mind trailing off, or if I get interrupted then I forget what we were even talking about in the last minute. 
In school, I feel like I switch between racing thoughts and persistent headache to a numb state when I contemplate my life. I have thought about death but I don’t know if I would seriously act on it. My outlook of like has also changed. I find it so hard to get up every morning and to find a reason to keep going. This world is so disgusting to me. From racism to corrupt politicians, to horrid crime, it really makes me question why I would want to work so hard just to live in such an ugly world. Yet, everyone seems to want to put on a smile and act like there aren’t children that go missing or that there are horrible people put into power in a manipulated system. Everything is so fake and I hate it. Yet, I somehow care so much about what people think about me and want to please everyone. 
The reason here in the first place is because I feel like I may be depressed but at the same time, there are a lot of times when I think I’m just overreacting or forcing myself to feel this way? I don’t know. Sometimes I feel like I’m such a disappointment to the people in my life. Like they would have been better off never knowing me. They can say they love me, but having them be disappointed in me hurts so much, yet I don’t seem to care enough to actually change. I feel like it’s easier just to give up. Is it worth asking for help? Is it worth being pumped on meds just to feel better in a shitty world? My head is hurting just writing all of this. I guess this is all I’d like to say.

83,"Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

This is actually the first time I've ever posted on Reddit but I'm looking for some answers about focus attention issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27, have a wife and a 1 year old with a stable blue collar job.  I life live with lots of regrets, such as not finishing college or getting any degree period.  I kind of fell into the lifestyle of blue collar work because I never could focus straight near the end of high school and especially into college.  I've tried to get remedies for this problem but they always end up in prescriptions (tried anxiety medication and it was like ten-fold worse).

&amp;#x200B;

To elaborate on the problem, whenever I'm sitting down or having a conversation with someone that isn't 100% casual, my mind wanders elsewhere almost immediately.  I recognize the problem, but if I try to fight what my brain is telling me to do, I get this internal feeling of ""I can't do this right now, you need to peace out ASAP"".  Even finding the courage to write this has been difficult because I consider it ""work"", although it's not.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example is exactly that, if I consider something ""work"", I just cannot find the willpower to start nor finish.  If I have to write a paper or do a resume, even if some of these things are considered hobbies, I give up almost immediately because I get that ""feeling"" that I just CANNOT sit there and do the ""work"".  This was my problem in college especially since it's nothing BUT that, hence why I stopped going and fell into this field of work I never really enjoyed.

  
In conversations, the issue is still there.  I'm a bad story teller because I lose train of thought rapidly and I always just ""want to get to the finish"" so I end up telling terrible short stories with people and I think people recognize my social ineptitude based off that and other factors such as changing subject randomly during mid-conversation.  I appreciate my wife, but sometimes when she's talking, almost immediately I want to change subject to something that just so happened to pop into my head.  I can carry a conversation most of the time but it has to be super endearing or something I can totally relate with.

I don't think I have ADHD, but I'm sure i have a form of ADD.  I used to actually be a straight A student as a kid and could always focus on my work but as I got older this issue got worse and worse.  I couldn't focus in school worth a damn on any project and it just spiraled out of control.  I'm not sure how to explain this to a doctor; I've tried and they just look at me confused but it's been affecting my life for many years and I want it to go away.

84,"My therapist referred me to see a psychiatrist for medication. This is my 1st time seeing a psychiatrist, not really sure what to expect. 

My main concerns currently are:

1.) I have this fear that someone is out to get me/someone is out to hurt me. I had plans this weekend with my bf and friends and I canceled because I didn't want to leave my house because I was paranoid. So this whole weekend, I barely even left my bedroom. 

2.) Personal hygiene...I try to shower everyday, but sometimes I just don't have the energy to. It literally takes alot out of me to brush my teeth/shower. 

3.) I either over-sleep or don't get enough sleep. It's not consistent. 

4.) I have a strong suspicion that I have a personality disorder (BPD) rather than a mood disorder (my therapist diagnosed me as Bipolar II). So how can a medication for mood disorder do me any good if I am actually suffering from a personality disorder? 

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons why I think I have BPD:

1. I tend to value / devalue ppl based on my interaction with them. If I like someone, I put them on a pedestal, but if they do anything to hurt me, or make me question them, then it's like they're dead to me. Its always been either all good or all bad with me, like there's no grey area. 
2. I can be super obsessive/possessive/clingy in my relationships. So possessive to the point that I've had my bf block some of his female friends on social media due to my jealousy issues. 
3. When I meet new ppl/new friends/new relationships - I tend to take on their hobbies, their likes/dislikes, their slang, lingo
4. Anytime my boyfriend is upset, I take it personally and think that he's upset with me (even if he's not) and I start to think that he's gonna leave me and then I start getting thoughts about ending the relationship so I don't get hurt by him breaking up with me first but that also stirs up my abandonment issues. There's been times when I've broken up with him only to beg &amp; plead him to take me back because I hate being alone. 
5. Paranoia - constantly think that ppl, even strangers are talking shit behind my back, they have bad thoughts about me, ppl are out to hurt me. Again this could even be b/c a stranger looked at me and I thought he/she looked at me weird, and that's when I start feeling this way. 
6. I can have an explosive rage if someone either says or does something to irritate me. I usually feel bad after going off on someone and I do feel apologetic afterwards.

88,"TL:DR - 14 y/o step daughter is determined to hurt herself or tear our family apart. Tried everything we can think of to help her and reconnect but it keeps getting worse. Looking for advice. 

My husband and I have been together for ten years married for less than a year. When we first met he had custody of one of his two daughters, we will call her CeCe. She was four, cute and fun. After two years of dating we moved in together. That's when things got harder, her behavior changed. We addressed it with counseling but it didn't seem to have much effect. When my husband's younger daughter who has autism came to live with us when CeCe was eight all hell broke loose. She began lying, telling people we abused and neglected her, broke into a neighbor's home, skipped school, and threatened another child with a knife all in the course of a year. We doubled down on treatment and therapy but to this day we have never been given an official diagnosis for her. Since that time her behavior has continued to escalate. She has been hospitalized at least three times for attempted suicide, she's run away, she goes online to talk to boys and men and tries to get them to take her in, she is trying to lose her virginity, and she has turned us in to cps on false allegations four times. She had become violent with us and verbally abusive. She abuses her siblings as well. 

The most recent episode was yesterday, we discovered she had stolen her autistic sister's tablet to Snapchat with her boyfriend and friends. Telling them we didn't feed her and she had to walk three miles to go to the store to get food for the kids or they would all starve. We have gone to great lengths to keep her off the internet due to her risky behavior online but she always seems to find a way. I don't know how to connect with her. Its clear that she is angry but no one can figure out why outside of her parents divorce when she was three. Her last hospital stay she told the staff she has been sexually abused when she was seven, but a forensic investigator questioned her and determined that it was a false claim.  I just want to have a normal life that doesn't involve polce, cps, and hospitals every month. I love her and I want her to be happy. I don't know how to make this work. Our only options left to us are institutionalize her or place her in foster care. 

I am really afraid of what is going to happen when she is supposed to get out of school. She might not come home again, she might report us to the school for ""abusing"" her again, she might try to hurt herself again. This is the pattern: she gets in trouble for something and the next day she acts out in one of the ways described.

Anyone who has any experience with this as a parent or from CeCe's perspective please give me some advice on what to do. I do not want to see her in a hospital, group home, or foster care. We love her and we want her here but we can't keep our three other children safe in the current circumstances and are running out of options. Our only family member who could take her on has just been diagnosed with cancer so we have no one to help us. Her bio mom hasn't been in the picture for eight years and is addicted to heroin and meth, so she isn't an option. 

Sorry for the long rambling post, I'm shaking and scared of what is to come. ",01Apr2019,2
89,"I'm in weekly therapy. Finally found someone I clicked with, after three others failed.

While I have been seeming a psychiatrist for almost a year, shes not helpful.  Shes not helpful un my sessions nor is she helpful with finding the right meds for me. Shes just there for the paycheck at this point.

I'm off all of the meds(cymbalta for ADHD, currently weaning off that. Seroquel for SLEEP and an antihestimean that treated anxiety) she put me on because they weren't doing the job. I medicate with weed too. But like I shouldn't be spending the same amount on weed if I have prescribed meds. Psychiatrist saw no issue with that.  There aren't many choices for psychiatrist in this area either. My wifes nor my therapist have any suggestions. I have repeatedly asked for a real evaluation, only to be brushed off. It's like she doesn't want to help me figure out what the fuck Is going on with me.

My wife and i fight a lot because it's just her and i.  No family. No friends in our area. It's just us and our animals. I'm coming off a 7 week medical leave unpaid and we dont even have enough money to eat this week.  Because we had to lay down over a grand for a new place because our current landlord was allowing our water to be shut off more than once.

90,"The past couple of weeks have been rough. I was drowning in all of the negative thoughts I ever had about myself. It felt like something was crushing my chest all the time and it hurt whenever I thought about talking to someone about it. I isolated myself from everyone, and kept everything from my partner. I was tired all the time and I slept the days away. I felt hopeless, and whenever I tried to think of any future plans, they weren’t there. It was like there’s a wall blocking me from seeing them. I wanted to break up with my partner because I thought he hated me but is just too nice to end things. I thought about killing myself, and at the time it really seemed like the most logical thing to do. I felt empty and full at the same time, and I was just so exhausted. There were also lots of times when people were talking to me and it takes a second or so for me to respond. I felt like I was trying to think through a fog. It physically hurt to think of any sort of positive thing and they’d get shut down by thoughts of everyone else being better off if I disappeared. I felt guilty all the time. There was just this ever-present guilt that gnawed at me and everything I did felt like a mistake.

Now I’m not feeling like something’s always crushing me. I’m just...detached from my emotions. It’s like they’re muted, and it feels like I’m just forcing it whenever I try to laugh or react to something. There’s still a weight in my chest that’s similar to the one that smothered me in the past two weeks, but it’s not as bad. I’m still constantly tired, but somewhat less. I don’t feel like I usually do, and it’s like I’m always teetering at the edge. One wrong move and I’ll get back to sleeping all the time and isolating myself again. 

It feels like that weight is a shadow that constantly follows me around and it shows a little bit of itself every now and then just to remind me it’s there.

I’ve never been to a mental health professional, and I can’t afford one at the moment. I know it’s wrong to look for a diagnosis from non-certified people but I was just wondering if I could be depressed. 

I doubt that I’m depressed, so if anyone has any tips to get over this, I’ll be grateful.",01Apr2019,5
91,"Hi,

I recently met with my psychiatrist for the last time and was undiagnosed with bipolar because I now no longer meet the DSM-5 criteria. I still am diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. Currently, I'm kind of going through this weird period where I'm unsure of what I want to do with my life. I'm in college, on my second year after coming back from being homeless among some other issues. Honestly, I'm doing well. Definitely better than I thought I would be years ago-- back then, I dealt with losing a lot of friends to heroin and other drugs and falling into some pretty shitty patterns myself. A long time ago I was set up to get some really great scholarships and be on my way to a great college-- then I fell into some bad patterns thanks to giving into some messy stuff while living in poverty. Basically, I'm on the mend. However, I've been really struggling with finances and feeling unsure of what I really want out of life. There's so many questions going around in my head right now. One being about my sexuality-- I've always considered myself as ""pansexual"" or bi and I'm definitely gender non-conforming... but I'm in a relationship with a man and sometimes feel lost about it? I'm not sure if I'm ever doing the right things? Should I really be worrying so much about half of the things that I do? Do I want to be a lawyer, ethicist, or professor-- or do I just want to clock out of it all because of the drama and emotional labor that comes with so much of it? Lately I just feel like I'm completely lost.

TLDR; after dealing with some fucked up things in my lifetime, I'm on the mend. But now I feel lost and unsure. Any advice on the best way to handle these things?

I often feel like I don't fit in anywhere, and just need to figure out being in a healthy mindset about myself and my life. ",01Apr2019,1
92,"So my meetings with doctors usually goes 2 ways.

1. They recognize my problem with anxiety and depression, so they go right to discussing medication
2. They analyze my living situation and tell me cats cure depression

Today was the 2 type of meeting. I'm being sarcastic on the cat bit, but it's the second time a doctor has asked me ""But don't your cats make you happy?"" Yes, they make me happy. Very happy. They're one of my reasons to live. But they don't take away my depression and anxiety.

Every time we talk about my support in life I feel it's always the same discussion. I tell them people leave me because my anxiety and depression overwhelms them. As much as I try to control it, it regularly spills over because I get triggered easily by abuse from my past. I tell myself to only contact friends when I'm in a good mood so I don't overwhelm them, but my depression and anxiety never gives me a relief. It's every day, 24/7. I can only fall asleep listening to documentaries so my mind won't go into haywire.

The help I was hoping to get from the doctor was medication that could help ease the overwhelming feelings my depression and anxiety gives me, so I can focus on other things. Even when I tell myself I don't need to feel bad about something, my emotions about it are painful and my mind keeps telling me ""Yes, you do feel horrible about this."" But I've pretty much tried every medication they can give me, which the doctor told me. And I felt she implied that I was thinking medication was a magical fix that would take everything bad away. That's absolutely not what I expect. I'm overwhelmed by the feeling that my anxiety and depression will be this intense for the rest of my life. I don't want to live like this.

I've been denied therapy on several occasions, because it's deemed my anxiety is too high to focus. Usually when one subject is brought up, it triggers several other instances of abuse. I was in private therapy twice and the therapists refused to continue treatment because I overwhelmed them. The only help I'm receiving is a meeting with psychiatrist once a week. He's thankfully patient with me and we've been meeting for several years. He's retiring this summer and I know I won't get help after that. He knows that too. 

I feel frustrated. I feel like I'm doing everything I can to improve my situation and sometimes I feel I make things worse the harder I try. It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to get help because things like today's disappointment set me back so much. I see no point going to another doctor when I'm just going to waste their time about how I fail to keep a social life. No adjustments was made to my medication. ",01Apr2019,1

I have no reason to believe that anything has changed in his life recently. He is doing well at school, but regardless, this is something we have never put any pressure on him about. He seems the same as he has always been. He has never expressed suicidal thoughts or mentioned feeling depressed.

So, it came as a shock to me today when I received a call from the school to say that he had text one of his friends to say he wanted to ‘end it all’ last night. The school is rightly concerned and informed me so that I could talk to him and get him help should he need it.

He has gone to school today as normal and seems completely fine.

Part of me wants to believe that this could have been a text for attention as he hasn’t spent as much time with the friend he text recently, but I know that mental health should always been taken seriously, so would never accuse him of this.

Looking for some advice on how to approach this as a parent. How can we broach this subject with him without making him clam up. I want to make sure he knows he can talk to us.

The same goes on with my gender strangely, one duration I am completely fine with being female and my confidence is boosted super high. On other days I feel male, this is where my ego goes low and I feel super insecure. 

Sometimes I battle with nihilism, and other times I feel happy with life and end up thinking that my darker times were just a phase. It's almost as if I feel like a different person with each change. 

I tend to treat people differently as well.
In my more positive mood I treat them with affection and dont mind telling people how much I love them.
In my more negative mood I openly judge them, I ignore their needs to vent and generally have a distaste in their opinions, interests and company.

Whenever I'm so negative with people I get so upset with myself when I'm positive again. I've tried to change myself a few times, but I always end up not caring about changing and returning to being an asshole.

When I'm in my negatives I usually forget what it's like to think nicely due to how indifferent I am. 

These things make me entirely confused on what my personality actually is. I've come to think that maybe I'm just a shitty person trying to play it nice. And it also brings difficulty within romantic relationships. But this has gone long enough.

Is this normal in anyway?",01Apr2019,3

A friend of mine committed suicide last week and it has impacted my entire mental health. I was already dealing with some anxiety and overall sadness but now I just don't know how to act anymore. I haven't cleaned my room/made my bed since, my finals are less than two weeks away and I haven't been able to concentrate on my studies or do anything at all because I have no motivation. Taking an appointment at my uni to see a mental health specialist takes over six weeks so that's useless. I also don't have money to go see someone else. It seems as though I will my heart is just down. I'm not suicidal nor do I plan on hurting myself at all, though. I keep forgetting that he's gone after a while and it messes me up when I  remember. I am just confused, tired, unmotivated, and I felt the need to vent to someone who is not related to me or grieving, i.e. all my friends, which is why I'm posting here.

118,"We’re 3 Brits who have experienced a range of mental health issues. Our experiences range from mild anxiety and depression to dropping out of school and university due to agoraphobia and extreme anxiety.

In our lives we’ve been trying various things to get better and thought working on something together would be good for us.

Counter intuitively we’re all quite optimistic about the future for humans so our experiment is a YouTube channel that discusses the future, history, economics, current events and other things to help educate others.

Alex – records the audio, and help script and research

Seb - does the video and audio editing

Joel – helps research and script and find video material

We’ve found it helpful in motivated us, getting us on track and boosting our moods and have had some great positive feedback.

We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to be involved in our little collective to see if it might help you too.

Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe putting ideas out for topics or getting involved in research and/or script writing.

Let's add some self over expectation and what do we get? When you get the best possible result, you get no satisfaction. When someone once has a better idea than you, you spiral down into depression and come out with the idea \*I must work harder to account for my stupidity\*.

I have really forgotten what enjoying life is. I listen to people talk about their experiences, what fun the had doing x and y, and just think to myself, when was the last time I felt that? Can't remember. Life is just a loop of working and ""resting"". Even things for fun become work after a bit. Gaming, watching movies, reading. \*I must do it\* is what replaces the little joy there was.

Why? What reason could there possibly be to destroy yourself, your brain, your body, your life. I mean, you get one shot at life, why waste it? Maybe you get joy from working, not me though. Maybe you are in a bad position and overworking is the only option, not for me though.

Since college I have been working in buyer, planner, and scheduling roles. It was fine at first.  Organization is a must in these roles.  After I started my latest job after being laid off from the previous one I have been self-sabotaging.  There are things that are required of my job that I just don't do.  This week it has all caught up with me.  My boss and her supervisor are going to find out that I have been lying about doing my work.  I see the situation as not fixable.  Either I come clean and admit to lying and try to make amends or keep lying to try and cover my ass.  Option two doesn't sound great and isn't the person that I want to be.  

&amp;#x200B;

Resigning isn't an option.  My parents don't understand and would disown me.  My mom has a better understanding of my mental state. Today I came clean to her about the situation and to get advice.  She wants me to try to fix it but not admit to lying.  I don't see how both can be done.  I'm a grown ass person but as a millennial with lots of college debt my parents still support me in some ways.  It's a weird dynamic between my parents and me but quitting would destroy how they see me. Their new perception of me would also probably send me deeper down the path of self-loathing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not exactly sure how to start but whatever. I am just really lonely, all the time. I do have friends but no close friends. I have consistently been a second choice friend since elementary school. The only times I ever talk to or hang out with people are at school and even then its only when I'm pretty much the only one around. I have actually hung out with friends once this year and three times over the past few, and I am made painfully aware of this on a weekly almost daily basis when I see snaps and stories of friends hanging out together. I used to try and initiate stuff, for just about all of freshman year I'd always suggest things to do and try and text friends but every attempt I made failed and I just gave up.

&amp;#x200B;

 Now I'm at a point where I'm just so socially out of practice that I can only hold conversations about school stuff in person and am just totally unaware about how to text with people. I don't feel like I have any way I can approach anyone about this because then I would not know if any invitation or conversation was because they wanted me around or because they pity me. I don't have any close relationship at all so their is no adult I can talk to about this. I go to an all boys school with small class sizes so its not like I could just make new friends because everything is already established, and its not like I could make friends with people who live around me because I live in a secluded suburb that is 99% elementary school aged kids. Honestly this is just a flailing attempt to maybe be told one useful thing that could help me out.

129," Am 15. I already accepted being alone for the rest of my life and i started distancing myself from others (subconsciously, not on purpose, but eh what can you do) about 5 years ago. I don't really feel bad or down or anything, i just accepted me being alone and people not liking me. anyway, I think that's because I sort of shifted my outlook (I guess?) about 3-4 years ago to 'no one needs you, and you don't need anyone'.

 I never really connected with my friends, when we hang out at school, they all talk to each other and meanwhile I just sort of sit there and zone out. Maybe tell them i'm going to do something and come back, but I never really do. I just put in my earphones and walk around school grounds until the break is over. I never really told them anything about myself - like, they don't even know that i have a cat. Had it for 7 years. They know not to ask me questions. 

 Iv'e completely ditched my dreams. Like, what will I gain from them? Nothing. So they are just not worth it. I sort of accept my situation as it is, but I can remember me being me, 'happy' (?,cuz im not sad either), from before 'i made' (it sort of just sunk in when I finished elementary) this change. Also, therapy is not an option (am not a pu55y lol). I mean, do i really need it? i just want to gain more information on my 'condition' (?? - is it even one?), or maybe this is just me venting (since I cant talk to anyone about this lol. I don't trust anyone enough like that).

 Also, iv'e never been like a social guy. Iv'e spent most of my afternoons watching Netflix or YouTube. Or just taking my whole bike apart and putting it back together (takes me 20 min tops at this point). I'm never bored, but at the same time, i'm always bored. But where can I go? My friends got their own friends that they hang out with after school (I don't know them, I think I don't want to know them, but deep down i know i would love to. oh, and all my friend live kinda far away because i go to a different school district [long story], so i can't just pop down to their place everyday to talk.), and i just sit here. Lonely. Sometimes i ride my bike to the edge of town, And watch the sunset over the desert mountains, and watch the stars come out. That's the only thing i really like to do.

Im in a situation where I have major confidence issues about the way I look. Back in my teens I was overweight but ended up losing it and now im at a healthy weight. 

Im super self concious about 2 things still:

- I have an underbite that needs surgery which causes me alot of stress
- I have bad teeth

I've been going to the gym for a long time and I work a physical job so I am not exactly physically ugly at a first glance but whenever I speak to girls and get a vibe that they might like me I get super self concious about my face which causes me to shutdown. 
Numerous times i've been in situations where a girl has made the first move and tried to kiss me but I get major anxiety and get out of the situation. A girl has once brought me to her place after a nightout, got undressed, climbed into bed with me and my anxiety got so bad I told her I had to leave. Not exactly my proudest moment...

This anxiety causes me alot of problems in my day to day life as well. Depression, borderline alcoholic, dropped out of school, working shitty entry level jobs. I cant even speak to my family without feeling anxiety. 
I can still function but I rely heavy on weed and alcohol to cope. 

Currently at work i've met a great girl that I vibe with. We instantly hit it off and we make each other laugh all the time. Problem is, whenever I meet a girl, I never think they might think I am attractive because my shitty confidence. But about this girl, I didnt think she liked me, which caused me to let my guard down and we became great friends at work. About 2-3 months after meeting her and us getting along well, she tried to kiss me once and like usually I just shutdown. Since then our relationship has been pretty shitty when we talk IRL because im nervous and awkward. This makes me anger because we had such a good time before and I feel like I cant do anything.

I think 99% of my problems are in my head and if I could somehow shutdown those thoughts I could be happy again but it seems impossible ATM.

The number one problem is definitely my underbite. The solution is to get surgery but its not exactly a walk in the park. Would need to wear braces for 1-2 years before the surgery and also afterwards for a while which I think would make my anxiety even worse.

I really want to get a girlfriend but I feel like its impossible because of all of this...

Feels bad man.

While it's probably not appropriate for me to speculate since I'm not a professional, I've read about bipolar disorder and it describes Jim to a T. Even if it's not bipolar, Jim has issues that I believe warrant seeking professional help. He has admitted this after some episodes over the past few years. I don't know if he has ever sought help or been formally diagnosed with anything.

Occasionally, Jim will lash out at me and/or my friends, usually over text message, for seemingly no reason at all. He will attack us very personally and it hurts. He seems to go back and forth between depression and mania. He constantly self-medicates with drugs and alcohol. Some of our friends have stopped talking to Jim because it's too much to handle. I've tried to maintain our friendship even though he's hurt me multiple times. 

Jim recently stopped communicating with us. He's ignoring our messages, left our group chats, and stopped following us on social media. None of us know why. This is hurtful and confusing to me.

After making several calls in my town and being told there’s a waitlist or cannot take new patients I finally found a couple of options. 

Option 1:
Meet with a doctor (PhD in psychology) to do my evaluation. I will have to pay out of pocket $700 for this assessment. I was taken aback by that that I didn’t even ask if they take insurance after the assessment. This doctor would be able to see this month (April). 

Option 2: 
Meet with a psychiatrist to do my evaluation. I will only have to pay $400 out of pocket and I believe they do take my insurance for regular visits. The only thing is they would not be able to get me in until mid May.

When I closed my eyes, it felt like his face/body were detached from whatever hands were hugging me. Even his face sometimes didn’t spark that “I know you, I love you” feeling. 

Rationally, I knew this was absolutely crazy. Emotionally, I was having thoughts like “the real BF is in [home state], not where I am” or “this isn’t him”.  I was also experiencing a minor panic attack at the time which lasted 30 minutes or so.

It has slowly progressed as I have gotten older; I would cut myself out of anger/sadness, burn myself with hot water in the shower, punch holes in walls, throw things, and now its gotten to the point where I hit my loved ones and berate them whenever I get upset. 

&amp;#x200B;

During these outbursts I try not to give in to my impulses, but it never works. I always give in and always end up regretting it afterwards. Once the situation is over, I always reflect on what I did and how stupidly I acted.

147,"My dad was extremely abusive. To the point that if we got sick we got beat. If we got periods we got beat. We got beat for anything that spent extra money. My mom left him when I was 11. She went into drugs and alcohol. Food was a major issue. She would buy drugs before food so I went days without eating. She made to much money for free lunches at school. Every now and then my step dad would get enough out of his alcoholic coma to give me 20 dollars for lunches. I learned fast to not use that money at school and instead would buy rice and canned foods for use to eat at the end of the pay period. I was a very responsible kid. This created the perfect storm in my head when I grew up and got a family for myself. I go shopping with the idea to stock up for two weeks. As I go I start to freak out. Anything extra that makes meal good I start to panic. I feel my chest become heavy. I can’t focus I start to grab nothing but rice but not getting things we need sends me into this kinda altered state where I just shut down. My husband has to grab my hand and walk me out of the store then he buys the groceries when I’m safe in the car. We never know when these episodes will happen. Sometimes it’s as little as a new toothbrush that sends me over the edge.  I do all the cooking my husband can’t just take over the shopping. He also worries that I’ll become a shut in. So we take these trips that take me days to get over. Recently I found a food delivery  app. It’s amazing I can actually shop for the stuff I want and we can afford which helps me a lot. But the problem of me becoming a shut in is still there. Today I thought about it. I’m going to fight this. Every day when we have sitters no matter what is planned we are going to make time to shop. Even if it’s 3 in the morning. I’m going to lean on him for support. Talk out my thinking process and get insight of what a healthy brain thinks. It might take me 20min to get a bag of chips thinking about all the directions my thoughts go in. I might not be able to get that bag of chips. But I will fight this.

150,"I love my friends I do. But more and more times I am making an effort and time off to always go and do what they want to do. But the day I want to do something that I choose to do they always back out. These would be two of my great friends(who I have the issues with) and I hang out with them individually as they like the one on one. So my one girlfriend ask me to go to the mall with her. I did and I took time out of my day to do so. The next couple of days I ask her to hang out with me in the evening and she said no. 
My other friend ask me to go to the movies with her so I did. Again the next couple of days I ask her to join game night with me and she as well said no. 

I don’t want to hurt their feelings but I am feeling hurt that they never want to come to the things I want to do. I am happy they invite me and I still go but I want to feel I am not being used. I know they don’t know how I feel and I believe they are trying not to avoid it but they both are so sensitive and I don’t want to lose them as friends. 

Any ideas I can do? ",01Apr2019,1

152,"For about 6 years since gaining debt (car, paying for rent, utilities, etc.) I have been afraid of missing time from work. I will put off doctor's visits, ignore things that I should have checked out, and self diagnose things based off of endless reading.

I have anxiety of losing my car, my home, not being able to provide for my wife and son, and requiring a costly medical procedure that I cannot afford if I do have things checked out. This anxiety stems from the fear of being out of work and being fired by my employer. I'm sure the male mindset of just toughing things out also comes into play, but the fear of being fired due to need medical care scares me into procrastinating medical appointments. 

How can I break free of this anxiety to take better care of myself not only for my own health but for my family's sake also? ",01Apr2019,3

there are not that many that check this box for me and this one **seems** like the best fit with the best credentials but it seems like they''ve had an office since a year only, so are they experienced enoguh ? (I'm only judging possible therapists by their landing page so realistically how would I know, right ?)

how do I know that it's working for me ? I know it's not gonna be an overnight thing but I mean how do I know that I'm atleast heading in the right direction as I'm really financially tight and this is kinda expensive but I've had more than enough and sunk even deeper than rock-bottom so I'm thinking f\*\*\* it I'm going to see someone but I'd like to cut the loses as soon as possible if it's not ""working"" but also don't want to cut the chord only because it's getting difficult (which I realize it probably will be) and I'm thinking that it's not going anywhere. 

  
I would also REALLY apperciate any pointers and advice on how to go about starting therapy as I'm scared af, I've never done this and don't know anyone who have and idk what to expect and how to manage myself through.

154,"How does anyone deal with crippling depression. Most days Im afraid to leave the house let alone have the ability to get out of bed. Some days I just dont know if its worth living. DEPRESSION SUCKS

Hell im afraid of being around anyone all stems from waking up during surgery in the hospital and having some other bad experiences in the hospital that would rather not go into detail. I literally fear being in groups now if im around anymore then 1-2 people I go into full blown panic attack.

155,"Hi. I'm a girl, 19. 
When I was 13-14 I've fallen into eating disorder and autoagression, it never got serious but I still suffer to this day (mostly by having thoughts about hurting myself which I have to fight off). I had suicidal thoughts ever since I can remember. 
Recently I realised how often my mood changes. I started a diary and it shows how I go from low to happy to low again every few days. I know people do that and its normal, especially when you're growing up because hormones etc, but during the low time I'm so self destructive. I often dont eat anything because I want to punish myself (I didnt do anything) or I skip classes because I cant get myself to leave my bed (my academics are terrible). My suicidal thoughts are getting worse and I feel completely worthless. When I'm in the happy state I'm like a normal teen I guess - joking, laughing, studying etc.
I can spend hours with my friends but the second I'm alone I feel like a total piece of shit who deserves to get hit by a train. 
My friends dont know about anything that's going on (some know about the ed but I dont think they took it as seriously as I did) and I dont want to tell them because I dont want to feel bad or pity for me, they have bigger problems than that. 
I was thinking about starting therapy but I dont have money rn, and I'd have to hide it from everyone. 
I dont know why I posting it here, maybe to vent. ",01Apr2019,1

I'm having some horrible weeks, and I find myself in a situation where I can't go looking for help: I'm broke, I moved to another country with my wife, and I don't speak the language.

I'm unemployeed, my mom has cancer, I'm having self destructive thoughts constantly and I'm on the edge. I asked for help in another subreddit the night I had a strong crisis but no one was there to read or reply anything, and the services I've found (7Cups) are far beyond the realm of my ecnomical possibilities.

158,"So for the past couple of years now my dad and his fiance have been having really loud sex, when they know I'm awake and can hear them. Sometimes his fiance will walk past bedroom door and poke her head in to see if I'm awake, the proceeds to go back into their bedroom and do it.

I keep shouting through the door that I can hear them and it's nasty, but when they finish my dad will call me in and have a massive argument with me about how it's weard that I tell them to stop and if I don't like it so much I should just move out. I already suffer from really bad depression from stuff that happened In my past and I'm near to the breaking point. 

He always shouts at me about it and when I retaliate he says I would go to the doctor and get pills to make me happy.
Please tell me I'm not the only one that has to suffer this abuse, and any advice will be so much appreciated.",01Apr2019,1
159,"Occasionally I feel like I’m in a dream. Surrounding that are familiar to me look different and feel more interesting. I’ve experienced this for as long as I can remember on and off. But since December I’ve been experiencing it nearly 80% of the time. This was when I started a new medication called Venlafaxine. I told my doctor and she said this was derealisation/depersonalisation. But this is a negative thing. I have read peoples accounts of this and they all seem like they feel disconnected from their surroundings and numb. But it’s nearly the opposite for me. I feel like my surroundings have become so much more interesting. Like I’m visiting a new country for the first time. 

The only way I can try to describe this would be to imagine you were going on holiday somewhere, and you looked at loads of photos and videos of the exact place you were going to be, so you felt like you knew exactly what it would be like to be there. But when you get there, it feels different to how you expected.

I know that doesn’t make too much sense. But I don’t really think there’s any other way I can describe it. Sometimes I even have the ability to make everything feel like a dream on purpose.

Does anybody know what this is? ",01Apr2019,1
161,"One time i was with my grama at some people's house it's mostly a blur. I think they where friends. I was getting sleepy so one woman told my grama i would sleep in her room. I was wearing a summer dress. She asked my grama permission for me to change so i would be comfortable to that's what happened. Then she left. After away i was woken up by that girl touching my body. I pretend to be asleep. She then got me to stand up. And made do things to her then she would do them to me asking if i like it i would say no. Then she got dressed and left. I never saw her again. I was far too little to even remeber her face.

When i was little i would spend the night at with my cusin. He's touch would wake me up, explore would explore my body especially my privates. I would pretend i was asleep hoping everything would blow over. This had become a regular thing but i was far too little i didn't know it was wrong.

 Then my step dad came in my life. And would try to bath me and explore my privates and ask me questions ""what is this"" while he would touch my vagina, My mom told me to tell her if things like this ever happened. But I never did. I was scared I didn't know why. Again hoping it would all blow over. 

Years passed. I started spending a lot of time with my gramma and her husband. When we would play he would show me his privates... When i was 11 i obviously started growing breast and developing different. I still had a mind of a child. He would make jokes telling me infront of my grama if i wanted to have babys with him and if i wanted to marry him. That was weird and uncomfortable. Then one day it was me and Armani at my tia Ana's house. We where playing with him. He would pick us up by the armpits and swing us around kinda like an air plane. But he would always grab my breast i didnt know why.

Time passed. One day i went to see some guy i would go to school with. We where having fun until he started been rough with me and hurting me. I didn't like it so i slapped him. He then slapped me back twice as hard. So i got up to get my shoes from his room wiping away my tears so i could leave. Walking in the middle of the hallway he hold me down and undressed me and tried to choke me so i couldn't breathe then raped me. 
I was just glad i left that night. I had no one to talk to in that time. I felt alone in my life. So i decided to put it on the back of my head and never to think of it again.

I moved back to my mom's. And one day i was just coming out of the bathroom that was inside my room to put on something else. i had no panties on. I just had my blause. My step dad walked in my room. And told me he knew what i was doing. I told him to leave. Thankgoodness my blause was a little bit long. He told me to sit down in my bed he wanted to talk i didnt wanted to I just wanted him to leave so i could put my clothes on! I keeped telling him to leave. But is like he didn't care. He then touched my leg And would constantly tried to look under my shirt. Asking me what was i hiding. I just hold on to my shirt thight pulling it down. I felt like mouse. In that moment. No where to run or how to get him to leave.

Then i continued to live my life as normal as i would be. Always denied the word rape. 

Untill one day me and my husband where having a funny discussions about his first time, but then he asked me how did i lost my virginity..........m. So i took a look back into my self.. I didn't know how to answer but. Something that i kept denying all my life that I had buried in the back of my head. Is like my concise talk to me. I dont remember having that moment. Thats because...

""i never did. My parts where exploited before i could even got to understand them. Then my first time with a boy i was raped.""
 But all i told him was ""i cant remember"" 
He knew that was a lie. 

But still then i dont even know how to approach the situation now or ever. I think im too late do to anything i always was. Even if i did or ever thought about it. How would i began?
Would they believe me?
who would i hurt? 
Who would know?
Who would understand?
Who would think im lying?
Who would puch me away after it comes out
Who would feel sympathy?
Would i be the mole of the family?
More than i already was. 

Today i realized why so many woman never come forward and report. Because we are alone.

I grew up poor and my parents fought a lot but that’s it. Im relatively blessed. 

I remember in 3rd grade, having a specific thought that stuck with me. In essence I had prayed to God (I was never religious and neither is any of my family) and said give me all you got, continue trying to keep me down because fuck it, I’m still gonna do me and come up on top.

163,"In the last week, I’ve had two friends commit suicide. Both were close to one another all throughout childhood and college. 


Both brought up memories and thoughts of “he just didn’t look the type”. 


I want you to know that there is no freaking type. You don’t look suicidal to everyone but those close to you want to know what’s happening. If they cannot see the struggle you are going through, please force them to see it. 

Whenever someone dies like this, the people around the situation grieve like no other; asking others if they had ever spoken about their struggle. Parents, friends, old classmates wail about wishing they had said one thing that tipped them off. 

If you are thinking about committing suicide, I desperately want you to pick up the phone and call someone about this or write your struggle down and give it to a friend and walk off. I don’t want you to feel alone and helpless in this world, like my friends did. I don’t want you to feel like no one cares because there is always at least one person in everyone’s lifetime that cares immensely for you. Choose that person. Choose your grandma. Choose your mom. Choose your sweet aunt may or your teacher. Choose your best friend. And when you choose them, figure out how to translate your struggle to them out of the silence that falls over you. Figure it out tonight and Talk to them tonight. Leave a voicemail if you have to.


Help us help you fight for your life in the drowning sea. ",01Apr2019,12
