0,"I’m going to a college that’s 6 hours away from home because I wanted to experience a new environment and be a bit more independent. I love my parents a lot and I always thought my parents were very supportive of me as they always talked about where I was going to other people, and even said it was perfectly fine despite me asking a bunch of times if it was okay with them.

When i’m in my room, I can hear my mom talking to my uncles about how anxious she is about me going far away. Sometimes I hear her talking smack about me to my younger sister, saying to not be stupid and go to a school that’s closer next time. 

I feel like my overprotective mom has been hiding her true feelings from me, and that she’s not actually supportive, which adds to the stress because of the transition to college. 

I feel like I made the wrong choice by going to this school and hurting my parents, but I also feel like I worked really hard to get this far. 

Has anyone else gone through this before? How did you guys cope with both being anxious in college and dealing with family? 


Thanks!",01Aug2019,2
1,"Does anyone remember when they were seven, maybe even 13 when mental health just seemed weird, and people who cut them selves were crazy and people who wanted to die were stupid, and people who had anxiety about things were strange?

Well... for a short period of time over the last couple of weeks I’ve had these... it feels so weird. I always thought it was impossible to feel numb or nothing, I was always happy... but it happens... it’s happening.

Mental health is something that should be explained at a young age since I’ve had this for a while but bottled it up and never been able to put a name on it...  

Ps: this is not meant to be offensive just showing through a short time how I’ve learnt so much and how I understand people with mental health issues and your not weird, crazy nor strange because almost everyone in their life will feel like this for a period some longer than others, some worse.

I,  yesterday day woke up happy, not numb for the first time in ages. Life gets better it must... right?

3,"First time posting here. Just need to talk to someone about everything right now and I can't afford counseling right now and I'm on a 9 month waiting list for professional psychological therapy .

A brief intro: I am mom to two awesome kids (12 &amp; 7), one of whom is just like me and the other who has a rare, terminal genetic condition (mitochondrial disease) . Dad is around seldomly, as he works hard to make sure that the kids have insurance. I had to give up my career to be my youngest's sole caregiver. She's non-verbal, still in diapers, fall risk, seizures, immunocompromised...the works. I work from home when possible but basically went from earning 2-4k per month to 1k, if I'm lucky.

Things have obviously been hard.

Recently, I've also had to go no contact with my ""family"" - you can check my post history if you want a rundown of the fuckery. The most recent betrayal was by my sister, in whom I had high hopes of her getting help and changing. 

She started a secret fundraiser using my terminally ill daughter and I suspect used the funds to maintain her lifestyle. When I confronted her &amp; my mother about it, my mother giggled and they instantly began a smear campaign to discredit me once I explained that I had reported it to the police. 
Now I'm getting passive aggressive emails and voicemails where the entire thing is either being rugswept or blamed on me. 

None of this is shocking to me, considering that my family was willing to choose their own *child* daughter's rapist over respecting any of my boundaries.... but it is still affecting me. I feel like it would be abnormal for me not to feel such pain right now, even with the historically set president for shitty behavior on their part. 

My parents and my sister both owe me about $4000. Since I went no contact, of course I expect that I'll never see that money again...and I could really use it. I just discovered that my license has been suspended for a lapse in insurance several years ago. It occured as my car was sitting in pieces in my driveway for a month but of course that doesn't mean anything to the state. 

I'm freaking out and I have been on the precipice of another depression for a while. I was keeping my head above water for a while but now I am drowning and literally have no one who is even willing to listen. I'll be able to scrape the money up somehow....but I just feel so fucking utterly alone and miserable. I feel like my whole life has been just waiting for the other shoe to drop but it's just raining shoes all the fucking time. 

I am diagnosed with Scizoaffective disorder, chronic depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. I cant afford a doctor or meds, so I'm just kind of gloaming through my life right now. I'm not suicidal but I'm not exactly upset at the thought of death. 

Before I fall asleep, which is already so hard to do lately, I am overwhelmed by a sudden feeling of total panic...that usually delays sleep even further. And when I wake up, I'm waking up in a cold sweat and full on panic attack.

I love my kids. They are my entire world. But I have kind of withdrawn myself lately and I hate it. Life is nothing but a nightmare of doctor's appointments, diaper changes, and school routines. I feel lost and mad and so so so *utterly abandoned*.

I don't know what to do anymore. I am so tired of just fighting to exist. I'm tired of feeling like it just has no point anymore.",01Aug2019,1

6,"I usually dislike sharing personal issues or posting things like this, but I'm really hoping someone has some advice or great resources I can share with my husband.

He is very research &amp; problem-solution oriented. He has never lived with or dealt with anyone with mental health problems and I can never find the right words to really get through to him. 

I'm hoping for resources or advice on how to explain to him how depression actually works on the brain - and why being busy, having more responsibilities/hobbies, or doing ""something happy"" doesn't guarantee being depression-free in a week. (Side note: husband is my favorite human &amp; is always very supportive even with foot-in-mouth syndrome)
I have a really hard time finding the sources myself, because, let's face it, who all wants to google search about their depression JUST to give it to someone and be like "" Hey!! This is mee!! :D""

7,First time posting on Reddit. I was hoping to get some insight on what's been going on with me. Lately I've been noticing it's hard for me to control my emotions. I go from making plans in my head to better my future to wanting to just end it within an hour of each other. I've been pretty good at keeping these thoughts to myself. But today I woke up for work and decided how much I hated life. N called in sick. Nearly quit. It's like my mind's constantly racing with thoughts. My emotions tend to change from sad to angry to confident. Alot of times I tell myself how worthless I am.  It's crazy cuz I know it's me telling myself this stuff but i don't understand why I would be so mean to myself. I'd go to a doctor but not clear on if my insurance is active right now. Thanks for any advice on what this may be,01Aug2019,1
8,"On paper, some would say that I am doing well: great job, happy relationship with significant other, healthy, etc. My last 6 years has been all about perseverance and defying the odds stacked against me. But recently, I’ve recently been overwhelmed with sudden feelings of inadequacy.

I’m proud of my accomplishments and the glow up I had from once being a degenerate. I bounced back from tremendous circumstances that would’ve changed my life horrendously. However, I can’t shake the feeling that I am still not measuring up to my full potential and that I am still “behind”. I have a 1/2/5/10 year plan that I frequently reassess and am on track from my plan that I created 4 years ago. But lately, I’ve been losing sight of my long-term goals.

Whether it’s second guessing my recent decision to take one step back (salary wise) to take 3 steps forward in my career, the looming uncertainty of being accepted into my target MBA programs, or my self-inflicted feelings of competition when comparing myself to my peers, I am starting to identify early signs of depression or decline in my mental health. The last time I felt like this was when the extenuating circumstances blew up in my face. 

I managed to climb out of the hole the first time by creating my short/long-term plans and sticking with it. But now, I’m second guessing myself and want to prioritize decisions that result in instant gratification rather than delayed gratification. 

How do I shake these feelings and keep my eyes on the prize?",01Aug2019,1
9,"I got high last week, and during that, I had what felt like a flashback of something that happened when I was between like 5 or 7. Around there. And I feel like it wasn't real. It was very clear at the time, and it really freaked me out. From the memor(ies) it seemed like sexual abuse, which fits very well with all of my mental health problems. Like, it all would make sense. I've always felt like I couldn't remember a great deal of my childhood. And I've always had this weird feeling that maybe it happened. But the person in this ""memory"" I feel would not do that. So I feel like I'm crazy for even thinking that. 

I talked to my boyfriend about it, and he said he thinks it didn't happen because he's remembered things that didn't happen ehen he was high. 

And I got high again, just to see if it would happen again, and it was like memories from my childhood kept coming back to me. But they weren't like this one. They were happy, and the perspecrive was very warped, like watching it through a tv. But I know 100% that those were real childhood memories. The other one, it was just surrounded by a very bad feeling. And while I ""remembered"" it, I could not stop shaking, and I was crying. For a while.

12,"I would love everyone’s thoughts on my idea. I work with High-School students and I’m thinking about bringing the idea to the Education Board of the county I live in.

When I was in school, guidance counselors on staff were “used by demand”, meaning if a student wanted to talk they could but if no students wanted to speak they were used primarily in discipline cases.

The mental-health epidemic is huge, the science behind how rampant depression/anxiety disorders are is overwhelming. 

If our public school systems are supposed to help students succeed, they should have students regularly have check-ups with a guidance counselor. Studies can be overwhelming, social poverty can absolutely destroy the psyche of a student in high-school.

This would potentially help reduce the amount of school-shootings, while also hopefully keep students from self-harming tendencies and maintain a more positive and productive state of mind.

It may be a lot to demand of a school system to have enough trained psychologists on staff to tackle thousands of students, but I would absolutely love for my tax dollars to go toward something like this.",01Aug2019,23
13,"I am in the process of seeing a psychiatrist and I wrote down almost everything that happens to me please have a read and tell me what you think I just need someone to tell me what is going wrong

* I am on auto pilot everything feels far away and the whole day trapped in thoughts
* I get intrusive thoughts 
* I find my ""life calling"" every 2-3 weeks
* In 2017 I had 1 month where I felt nothing but energy and the world seemed so exciting I had no symptoms of anxiety or depression but I was sleeping less I would wake up at 5 am to do gardening and then stay up until 2-3 am I felt alive. Then out of the blue I started to have what felt like a break down I got so anxious I turned to religion to help me but then I got to the point where I was obsessed about it the only thing I would read was the bible and Christian social media I started getting intrusive thoughts and the suicidal thoughts were at there strongest at this point. I was convinced I was hell bound I felt nothing but pure fear I then started to think I must become pure because this must be my calling I started looking up apologetics and evangelism and was convinced I was in training to convert people I was convinced god was sending subtle messages trough social media all pointing to me being a prophet/ evangelist all of this happens in the span of 3 months then as time went by slowly I began to look back and noticed that I should tell a psychiatrist about This
* At one point it felt like I had a separate stream of thoughts that I could not control 
* I am convinced I will go to hell because I am not a perfect Christian 
* Sometimes I explode in an intense rage and end up hurting myself and saying things I regret
* Thoughts so loud it's like I can hear them 
* Song or speech will replay in my head over and over and over 
* When I was in school I would stay away from all the male teachers because I was convinced they would do something to me and should not be trusted I eventually dropped out of high school
* Sometimes my ego is through the roof and it leads me to say stupid things and then it crashes and I feel horrible 
* I get brief 1-2 week spurts where I am convinced my family secretly hates me and wishes I was dead , it will start small and then my thoughts don't stop and then I snap on the ones I love convinced they don't care or love me and then when I cool off the next 2-4 days is a weird calm
* It feels like I ""find out who I truly am"" and then within a few weeks I am depressed and suicidal 
* I don't know who I am 
* I feel like a freak 
* I feel empty 
* I am so anxious I can't leave my house

* My views shift quickly 
* I feel bad like I am wasting professionals time
* I spend a lot of money on things/ hobbies I eventually get bored of
* I feel like what I went through is not bad enough to be classified as trauma

16,"I may be doing completely normal things that I find confusing because of my young age, being in the developing stage of my life I have been trying to take that into mind, but I’d like to take these different problems off my chest and into this unnecessarily long story to people I don’t know, I’m typing this as it comes to mind so it will be very random, misspelt and probably repetitive. 

I subconsciously try to make myself heartless and cold even though I have close to no control of my emotions, crying without feeling sad and screaming to the top of my lungs when something does not go according to plan, but I guess that’s normal at my age of 15, I see all emotion as weakness, I see typing this itself as a weakness and a show of emotion but try to ignore the voice inside me, I think up scenarios in my head of terrible things, of me losing everything I hold dear and telling myself that I’m better of without them, without family because they are a liability, without friends, without love and without any sort of connection that id be willing to put myself in danger for. I tell myself I’m not made for the life I was born in, that school kills potential and wastes my time.

I feel as if I have the good me and the bad me, for example from a young age I have had urges, I think it started at the beginning of my development so around 10-11, they were sexual at first but disappeared, now they are violent, for example I was walking down the road and I saw and old man with a cute dog, and I’m my mind I flashed to me kicking the dog and telling myself wouldn’t that be funny, then flashing back to my normal self and feeling guilty. 

I punched a wall and badly hurt my hand, I was angry, I told myself to stop feeling the pain and squeezed my hand in anger, talking to myself, telling myself that I’m weak,  I get angry when Im scared, angry that I’m showing weakness.

I had an abusive stepdad who beat me and my mother, I get angry when I think of him and wish I could have a go at him at the least, I won’t say what I mean because I don’t know if I can get trouble for threats here,  but I wish I could make him pay for everything he did and it brings out the violence in me and straight after it fear of being hurt.

I think the reason I don’t go wild and go through with my urges is because of how weak I was made to feel listening to my mother cry and being able to do nothing, being beaten and being able to do nothing, so there’s always the feeling of weakness and uselessness holding

When girls approach me with the intent of anything more than friendship I don’t know what to do and I go into autopilot which is being a dick and completely reject and or insult them.

When I went to therapy to talk to this woman about why I stopped going to school, I went into auto pilot but this time speaking emotionlessly and stared at the wall tearing up

17,"So some backstory I guess:

I quickly became severely depressed when I was 14/15. I was cutting and I had some really toxic friends and it was just all bad news. I hit my lowest lowest point when I was 16 and my best friend (the most toxic of all) told me she was going to commit suicide. I was overwhelmed with worry and tried to commit suicide myself. Twice. And I backed out both times. Bad bad stuff. Our friendship was cut off so quickly and I felt so shitty. Like so fuckin shitty. 

I'm a writer. I've always loved writing stories and books and editing and that's what I plan to do with my life now. So when I was in this extreme state, I created a character who is very much like myself and I used him to write out what all I was feeling. All of the suicidal thoughts, the gory details of self harm and everything. I kept it all to myself of course, and I still write in it occasionally. 
Soon after I my contact with my friend was cut off I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was put on meds for it (I'm feeling a lot better now after 3 yrs. Thanks for asking). I still get depressed from time to time and manic, but usually its bearable. I was still cutting occasionally but definitely not as much. 
For 3/4 yrs tho, I've been using my character to escape into to avoid what emotions and depression and guilt from me cutting I felt.

Sooner or later he just became me and now I feel like hes just another part of me that I still escape into from time to time. I've just recently (after thinking about it for a while) have come to the conclusion that I have somewhat of a split personality (I'm good at managing it, we're chill we get along, and hes really glad that I'm acknowledging him). I've just recently come out to my 2 best friends about it and they were really supportive and caring and understanding.

The passed 2 months I have been thinking about cutting like every fucking day (I'm 7 months clean now), and a few nights ago it was really really bad. I escaped into my other personality and I have been him for the past 2 days. I think my friends know because they know about him, and they still view me as one whole person (which I kinda am ya know). But like he feels the need to really tell them and kinda introduce himself because hes really helping me out and preventing me from cutting again and breaking our 7 month streak. Hes really worried tho that they wont really accept him or that they'll be weirded out and idk. 

Its really been a mess inside my head. We want to be more open about this but its been such a secret for like 3 yrs its hard to come out about it and fully introduce him. He doesnt want them to think that hes just an act I'm putting on or that hes not real. Hes very real to me, hes a part of me. He is me. We are the same person but separate. Really weird fuckin hard to explain. 

Does anyone have any tips on how he can be more comfortable around our friends so that he can be more open about himself?",01Aug2019,1
18,"Hello I'm 21F and I have a father complex. I also think I have a problem with men. I feel like this problem of mine is getting more and more messed up and unsolvable. I really need help but I don't know how to solve it.

I was raised by a single hard working mom, and my dad has always been absent in my life. There weren't really much men in my family. The only men I was close with were my grandfather and my uncle. But after my uncle married and had a daughter, we became distant. He is such a good father and a husband. He's exactly the type of dad I wish I had. I still envy my cousin(uncle's daughter) so much for that. After my aunt gave birth to my cousin, I remember my uncle told me that now since he has a child, he won't be able to spend as much time with me as he could in the past so he hopes I understand. It's still a sad memory for me I don't know why. Even though I'm not close with him right now, whenever I see him and his family, they really give me a healthy family and father representation. They give me such hope and I feel thankful for that. 

When I was a teenager I used to have this uncontrollable outburst of crying when I saw dads being nice dads to their children. It made me wanna have that so much. It made me pity myself for missing out on that.

I was really close with my grandpa but then something happened and he didn't talk to me for about 7 years and that hurt me so much. Now we are very close and he is very affectionate to me but it still hurts when I think about it.

My first memory of my father complex was when I was in 5th grade. There were a few trainee teachers in their 20s in my elementary school. I had this gigantic crush on a guy who was 26 years old and he was just really nice to me(not in a perverted way at all). I was uncontrollably infatuated and obsessed with him that time. It's sad and messed up come to think of it.

I don't know if this memory is relevant but I was bullied by a guy in 5th grade. I don't know why but he hated me. He would use curse words often and slapped me in the face once. At that time, I was an outcast so I didn't have any friends to rescue me or whatever. I've never told this to anyone. I'm still so ashamed by it. Maybe I was obsessive to that trainee teacher cuz he was so nice to me when noone liked me. I still get extremely nervous and feel like crying and throwing up when a guy jokingly use curse words to me. 

Since then, growing up I've always had crushes to nice male teachers in their 35\~50s. Thankfully I only had crushes on the 'nice friendly dad' types. Looking at them being such a nice dad type teacher made me feel weird inside. It made me wanna have that, just by myself. I've never acted on my emotions but I often found myself flirting on them without knowing. This is so messed up. 

Now it's been a while since I realized my problem so I intentionally try to avoid my feelings toward older men. That  It's not like I don't like men my age though. It's just that the instinctive feeling I get when I see 'nice dads' disturbs me so much cuz I know it's not a pure and innocent emotion anymore.

Any positive emotions I get from men immediately becomes into something sexual. Literally any positive emotions like father-daughter, friendships, etc. wouldn't stay as it is cuz my brain immediately links them into a sexual relationship. Men are either irrelevant or sexual to me. There is no between. I find it really interesting when I see men and women being friends because my body and mind wouldn't accept that. I really envy that too. 

I don't know what to do to solve this. I've never told anyone about this.

23,"16M if that helps with perspective or whatever.

I don’t know what the right move is. People have said you should open up and get support from whoever you can, but I don’t want support or to share my feelings. I want a solution, to fix my problems etc. and that relies on therapy and stuff which I’m still waiting on.

I know I can’t expect my friends to understand or be able to help, so I think telling them would do nothing to help my situation and just ruin their image (is that the right word?) of me. There’s never a right time to drop a bombshell on someone and be like “yeah i have depression and ocd and sometimes i wanna die btw"" and I don't wanna be a burden on anyone either.

The only reason I’m considering the decision is I don’t want the fact that I never told anyone to come back and bite me in the future due to me keeping it hidden so long. It might send the message that I never trusted them enough (I noticed I’ve never really opened up to any friends before) or something like that.

On the other hand, it could ruin my friendships or make them weird. They may not understand or know how to react even though I think they are good people. It could make things awkward cos I’m not gonna willingly show my depressed self in front of them, making me seem happy/normal when I’m around them. It'd just make things more complicated but I don't know if it's possible to hide forever.

This has happened with every single person I’ve become close friends with and the only common factor has been me. It’s extremely bad for my mental health to constantly think about how angry my close friends make me. I still love them deeply, I talk to them everyday and they’re relatively nice to me but the little things they do really get to me and make me so angry. I become extremely judgy and snappy when talking to them after I remember random mean shit they’ve done to me in the past. I assume I might just be too sensitive and overthink things.

25,"So at work today I was training a new employee (something I’m not too fond of). One of the managers told me that he was a little slow and had assistance with living and stuff. I go over the basics and show him how the slicer turns on, how the buns go in the toaster, and where to find cards with what goes on each sandwich. He was doing fine, but we got busy and I couldn’t really help him every step of the way. I kept referring to the cue cards and pointing at the sandwiches he needed to make but I still had to guide him. I’m a pretty patient person but I began to notice something. I don’t think he can read. I had to tell him what sandwiches were being made. This really began to stress me out because we got BUSY.

27,"My housemate is having a severe episode of some kind, and it is not getting better, What can I do. He is stomping around the house all day loudly vocalizing hatred and grievances. He sits on the porch, nearly shouting, to nobody in particular about how effed up other people are. He stands on his balcony cussing and cursing, threatening people, and shouting for hours on end. He just now came downstairs yelling about how he could harm others without without a weapon. Now I hear him shouting outside, It is 9:30 pm here.

Today I was in a local business, around the corner, and I learned he had entered--acting scary--and was chased out with a baseball bat and told never to come back. A patron there was too scared to walk to her car alone. 

I am in my bedroom with the door locked. I am physically disabled, and old. He is threatening, deranged, and abusive, and much of his hatred is currently directed at me personally. I am afraid to go into the kitchen.

I am sensitive to the plight of the mentally ill. I have had issues myself. I do not want anything bad to happen to this guy, but I fear this is not going to end well. I was afraid to call the police because of the possibility they might provoke and then shoot him. (The local cops I met turned out to be very well trained in deescalation, but all it takes is one bad one and tragedy can happen.) The landlord says he has agreed to leave at the end of next month. I feel certain he is not capable of finding other housing in his present condition. He is outside on the back porch yelling more hatred and grievance now.

29,"I'm an IT intern for a decent sized company -- about 1000 people. There are 5 interns that work in the department. Two work with a software development team on a specific project, two are updating an app, and I work with the data and make programs and vizzes (graphics)  that relay the information in a quick and simple visual.

We just had out internship presentations on Monday. Those were an overview of all the work we did all summer and what we gained from the experience. There were maybe 7 different presentations for each intern/set of interns -- the pairs could present together. Each person had their lead come watch their presentation, along with anyone in the company that wanted to see.

I specifically asked my mentor if he would go, and he accepted. My boss was set to go too. We use Microsoft stuff so everything you accept is on your calendar and you get a notification 15 minutes before the event. A little background: I had and absent father growing up, so I get pretty sad when middle aged men don't show up to things. Like I get my hopes up and then I get really sad and feel let down after. Well, both of them didn't show up to my presentation and so I just presented to everyone else's bosses and stuff.

For one of the pairs that I work in IT with, their boss said they were the best interns the division has seen. We do different work and so I'm not in the same ""division"". But, again, he spoke to them today about how impressive their work is.

I've been incredibly insecure about the work I do there. They don't use any of the programming languages I know, so they didn't put me as a developer, which is what these people do. I talked to my mentor and he told me I'm ""easily the best intern"" the he's had. I think that's nice, but I also feel like I'm not doing that well. I run out of work all the time because I complete things quickly and it's quality work. I just don't think I'm living up to the expectation they have.

Listening to other interns get praise and I'm just left by myself at my desk makes me really sad. No one showed up to my presentation, which makes me sad. No one that I worked with or even interacted with saw my presentation. My family friends that work there didn't even see the presentation. I'm tired of working there now. I liked that job but now I go in dreading it all day. I fell asleep at my desk today because I'm just not happy anymore. My desk is right in front of the bosses' offices, so I feel like they hate me even more.

I have 12 days left and it can't come fast enough. I'm so sad and tired of working there. I, again, don't have any work to occupy my mind. I have a mood disorder, so when I get depressed, it's usually after a really good period of mania. I feel horrible and I just needed to rant on here so I quit crying like a baby. I'm lucky my partner is helping me and reassuring me that I'm doing well and that I can't compare myself to them because the position isn't the same. 

Everything is fine and I'm not in a really bad place, so don't mind this post. It's just for me I guess. There are more pressing matters on this subreddit. I'm just sad and want to rant.",01Aug2019,1

I still doubt any issues sometimes. I have for the most part ignored it thinking I’m fine. However I’m doing something a lot lately- thinking things that will definitely upset me and listening to music that I know will make me think things that upset me.

I spoke to my psychiatrist yesterday about this depression and he recommended switching me to Trintellix which I guess includes and SSRI with some kind of antagonist something...

No side effects for me yet, but it has only been one day.

I go through episodes (probably 2/3 months each) where I get EXTREMELY anxious and insecure 24/7. I feel completely unwanted and annoying. Everything I say, do, post, comment, text, etc. is regretted and makes me embarrassed. I can’t explain how strong and overpowering this feeling is. There are other times in my life that I feel content and I don’t feel like I need validation from anyone. I don’t know what triggers these changes but they happen quick and out of the blue. I get so insecure, that something as simple as someone saying “I miss you” makes me feel extremely relieved and happy.. it’s like I’m waiting and praying that someone will just be like hey! Just wanted to remind you I’m grateful for you :) I feel so stupid but I want to know if anyone has these episodes as well.

37,"Hey all.
I've had some very bad luck with holding a job, and managing my mental illnesses, and type 1 diabetes. Normal jobs are tough on me, physically and mentally. I have ADHD, anxiety (especially social), bipolar, and depression. The diabetes alone is rough. 

My current job is taking a huge toll on my health. 
I work in a warehouse, doing shipping. I have had a lot of anxiety holding customer service jobs, so I thought a warehouse job would be good. 

 I'm extremely anxious when I go to work. I don't like engaging in conversation much. I'm usually too anxious/stessed. This has gone on since I was a young child. I get so anxious that I can't talk. 

I want to find a job that will give me the insurance I need (I have specialists, and CenCal/MediCal was terrible), and enough pay to afford living in California on the central coast. 

I've considered disability, but it won't pay enough, or allow me to have my doctors. 

Basically, I'm just trying my best until I am let go for poor performance. Which is what had happened with every job I have had. 

It's really hard to explain this without seeming like I don't want to work. I do, but I feel so limited. It's extremely frustrating. 

I'm on four different psych meds, plus insulin pump, and continuous glucose monitor. All of these things help tremendously, but the pressures of work, and feeling crippling anxiety is too much to bear.",01Aug2019,1
38,"So this will probably get buried, as it's more of a vent, but I have been waiting about a year to be medically cleared and put on a wait list for an intensive physical therapy/ treatment program at my local hospital and now that the time has come I regret everything in my entire life leading up to this point. I deal with some health conditions that cause me a lot of pain and inhibit my mobility to a moderate extent. The purpose of doing this program is to put me into an intensive environment to work on physical rehabilitation and pain management through constant movement and  exertion of energy. I am about to be on day five and feel like a complete failure and disappointment to my parents, and hospital staff. I am way behind the other person doing the same program, and every waking second of the day in this bright luminescent 80 degree building burns dread and angst into my soul like a cattle being branded with a cast iron rod. I am over whelmed with guilt over the fact that I have the privilege to be in this program, but at the same time anger like when a toddler throws a tantrum out of confusion over something it neither wants nor understands. Ironically I am in a lot more pain than before which is supposed to happen? And now get to spend the free time in my afternoons dry heaving into a sink whilst trying to drown out my mental anguish and suicidal ideation with poorly made reddit commentary videos. Of course there is a team of medical personnel equipped to respond to an acute emergency, but they're general philosophy seems to be ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" and if you look like you're dying everything is fine until you tell them you're are dying.

I already felt like shit bc of my sleep, skipping school, prelims coming up, and I thought I'd be starting HRT to transition (I'm trans) around now/earlier but I'm still pretty far from it (I really wanted to have been on HRT for about a year before I go off to uni so that I wouldn't have to stress so much about passing and coming out at uni so it's been really stressing me out) but my mum came along and made it worse by yelling at me and telling me that my sleep issues are an ""attitude problem"" and that I was making up all this stuff about myself bc I heard it on the internet. Then she pulled the whole ""people in Africa have it so much worse than you"" shit. She went on for like an hour and I just wanted her to leave me alone bc she was really stressing me out and I couldn't stop crying. I've never cried so much in my life. 

We just went to the doctors to ask him about the sleep stuff and I was still in a really shitty mood obviously so my eyes were kind of watery the whole time. We mentioned HRT again and he asked me if that was something that was stressing me out and I was like ye and started crying more. So when we're leaving and my mum is sorting stuff out with the receptionist I'm still crying a bit so I don't really look at anyone and once we leave the building she's like, ""wow you didn't even say thank you to the receptionist,"" and tells me that I need to speak louder as well which I'm so sick of hearing esp from my mum. I was never diagnosed but I'm quite certain that I had bad social anxiety when I was younger so obviously she always tells me to speak up and all that when *I know I'm being too quiet and shit and I wish I wasn't*. It's always been worse when my mum is around as well :/. But this year it's gotten a whole lot better to the point where I hardly ever even think about it anymore so when my mum said that shit it really pissed me off bc I *have* gotten better at talking to people it's just that I was stressed and crying and my mum was a big contributer to that",01Aug2019,2

I am panicking but i’ve been told this is for the best. he should be able to help me get on disability and food stamps. The first thing he says is “you marked a lot” i told him well yeah i’ve got a lot wrong. then he asked me but do you really? i didn’t know what to say. so i said nothing. then he starts going through it. would ask me well how do you have anxiety. i would start to explain and then he’d cut me off and say well that’s not true. then asks about the next thing and do it again. never letting me explain anything. he then tells me my meds are wrong and i don’t need those (antipsychotic, anxiety). i told him they make me feel better so he tells me we will keep them for now. I’m full on panicking. he can’t take me off last time i was off i almost killed myself. I want to leave so bad. he asked my sexuality and i told him polysexual. he told me no can’t be there are only two genders so that’s not a thing. I’m also a trans man so that freaks me out even more. he asks about my learning disability. i told him i don’t spell good and i can’t read good. he said rudely yeah i see you can’t spell even simple words. but you have to be able to read. what about on your phone. i told him i use voice over or it takes me a while to read. but my learning disability was never declared. just that i have one. i was once again told they don’t do that. i don’t know what i’m talking about. we finally get to the end of the meeting. we haven’t talked about not be able to work or function. he said you have anxiety and maybe ptsd but probably just anxiety. I then tell him i’m trying for disability. he asks me why? but not in a friendly tone but like a just asked the worst thing ever. i told him i haven’t been able to hold a job so i’m homeless and have no food. i just need some help tell i can get into a program to help me with my disability. he told me no you don’t need that you just need to try harder. the asked me who’s “we” i told him me and my mom. she helps me with paperwork. then he set up the next appointment and i got out of there fast.

On the lower doses before this I felt it was helping a little, but not enough, and now I feel like the higher dose is making things worse.

It is so important to talk about your mental health and not keep things bottled up. I think the first step towards healing is talking about it, and then comes acceptance.

I haven’t grown up in the best of circumstances but it’s hard to piece everything together because my mind is still recovering from the concoction of medications I was on to make me docile. I’ve been off them for a month and while there’s minor improvement I don’t know how much of my old brain I’ll get back. I used to be somewhat normal, I know this. My parents pulled me out of school to be homeschooled in a closet for 3 years starting in 2nd grade. After this, since I never left that closet, I lost significant amounts of social skills and was relentlessly bullied until I switched schools in 9th grade. It got pretty bad, to the point where I had a fantasy and a plan to shoot up the school in 8th grade. My parents somehow didn’t notice this. I started to heal a bit in 9th grade with a supportive friend group but I realized how sick I was in the head and couldn’t shake it. I attempted suicide on April 22 of that year. My parents still didn’t notice and dragged me to church the day after this, while I was still shaking, pale, clammy, and miserable from my overdose on Benadryl (lack of research didn’t help me here.) They didn’t have a damn clue until when i confided in a close friend months later and he told them. My first hospitalization was fairly productive, met cool people and learned some stuff. Also somehow managed to get with a girlfriend for the first time during that summer. She was my first everything. I felt like I was getting better. As a result of my first hospitalization I was also prescribed abilfy, adderall, and zoloft, they weren’t too noticeable at the time but long term use put me where I am now. Things get foggier sophomore year, but I remember we broke up and I was in very poor shape mentally. Physically, best shape of my life though. I was jacked. But anyway, sophomore year towards the end of April I broke up with her for reasons I don’t remember. I felt terrible though, and after a few months I snapchatted her and we got back together for a while, but then her mom broke us up right before school started. Junior year was not off to a good start and it’s all downhill from there. I was way overcommitted, playing football on an 0-10 team full of people I hated, taking classes above my grade level, I was barely sleeping but at least I had my trusty adderall. I ended up hospitalized again in November, and despite missing nearly half of the quarter I still got a B+ in calculus. I was going out at least one night a week, taking my parents car without permission to see if I could get the guts to ram it into a tree. January I was hospitalized again, and I was forced to drop calculus and Spanish. Also during this time I had a brief relationship with the football team’s kicker (who is a girl) and it was fun but we didn’t really click. I quit football upon my discharge from the hospital and my grades did not improve despite the lightened workload. I missed comical amounts of school, amassing over 40 tardies and 30ish absences. I got a 12% in English in the 4th quarter and now I’m going back to my old school district. Hope this is somewhat coherent, I’m willing to clarify as much as I can.",01Aug2019,21

So every day at random times and frequently she starts grunting for a few seconds then starts to rock violently back and forth again for a few seconds. When this happens she sometimes goes red in the face and rubs her hands together also. 

Other times she can start smiling with it and start charging around then do the rocking. There are times it can be embarrassing as she's done it in public and friends used to laugh at her as kids so did I at odd times aswell but never mind. 

It annoys my, dad he sometimes tells her to stop and the thing is she is aware she is doing it. I've never seen anyone else do what she does in my life that's why I wish I knew exactly what it was.

I had to take my Xanax to keep from doing anything that might cause harm to myself last night when I started getting suspicious. I almost just decided to go to the hospital so I could be sedated. It is THAT bad.

After taking a long, hot, scrubbing scrubbing scrubbing bath, I finally fell asleep in a chair in my living room on the other side of the house. Only a few hours, but I take what I can get. I left for class and was itchy all day (I'm telling myself it's paranoia, because I don't have much evidence of actual bed bug bites). I reluctantly returned home a couple of hours ago (2:30AM). I can feel them all over me. I want to tear my skin off.

I want to shave my head and scrub under scalding water until I'm SURE they're not on me. But then, they'll just get back on me. Especially since some things have been moved from my room into other rooms of the house, which basically just spread any bed bugs that would have been there ALL over the whole fucking house. 

So I'm pretty much fucked. I can't sleep. I'm thinking of just sleeping in the bath. If I drown, at least I won't have to go back into my room ever again. I'm obsessing about it constantly. I might have to move to my boyfriend's place in the meantime just to get the fuck away from this shit. My mental state can not take this kind of shit right now. I want to scream-cry for hours. If I didn't live with my parents, I probably would. Honestly might have just shot myself or burned the house down if I were on my own. 

This phobia very rarely grips me as hard as it is at this point in time. I would rather die than be around any of this shit. I want to fumigate the whole house. Let the chemicals sit for weeks. Then we can aerate and get back to life. 

If I can't get over this, I'm afraid it's going to really start fucking with my everyday life and become increasingly more debilitating. I already feel completely helpless and fucked up in the head. 

TL;DR: Insect phobia gripping hard. Considering hospitalization to keep from self harm. End this hell.",01Aug2019,3
55,"Hi there,

I'm a newbie here, I actually joined Reddit to make this TL;DR post and ask the community for opinions and maybe some hints. I'll try to describe my issues/background and a big life change I would like to do, which is not fully supported by my doctors and surroundings.  
I'm 28, have Masters degree in Electrical Engineering and Communication, since graduation I write firmware and software for living. At the end of 2018, I was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, it was 4-th manio-depressive wave (always starting with depression, I already know the triggers and the pattern), in July 2019 my diagnose was changed to schizzoafective disorder (overly simplified description of this disorder in my case is ""BAP with some schizophrenia as seasoning""). I have genetic predispositions to mental issues from both of my parents families and I also lived some wild life, tasting all kind of drugs every now and then, preferring psychedelics over stimulants...  
My triggers were always of intellectual kind. Since the early childhood, I was very talented kid, straight A's on elementary and high-school, all the university exams on first try, both bachelor and diploma theses for A's... My first depressive way was during the diploma thesis, which to me appeared as not successful enough (it was pure research and development and I couldn't accept the fact that I will not reach all the goals I made for myself and that it will not be as good as I imagined). All the other waves were similar, but came from work. Every episode was worse than the previous one.

Every of those waves started with me saying ""ok, let's focus on this"", I stopped drinking, smoking weed, ruined my sleep, unable to rest. I stopped caring about my hobbies, I didn't want to eat or have sex... It was always vicious cycle, depression caused by such sudden changes, big goals for myself and serious sleep deprivation.  
As it happens, the stuff that was stressing me eventually passed and I got out of the depression. In the later waves, I got help from a specialist, taking antidepressants. This lead to fast swing to the other extreme, mania. Since then, I'm on increasing doses of anti-psychotics. During my last mania (cca March-July of 2019), I broke up with my GF, bought a car of my dreams, went for a road trip in it, spent all my savings, got back from the trip, crashed my beautiful car... I was put into long-term sick leave by my doctor, she took away my license. Since I have screwed up massively and repeatedly at work, I was fired during my first 2 weeks of sick leave. I stopped with alcohol completely, I don't have the urge to taste other drugs few times a year, I still do smoke weed, I don't want to stop with all my bad habits at once and go crazy because of that.

Since then, I'm cooperating with the pros, working on myself, getting used to the fact that I'm ill and I'll be until I die. I'm still on the sick leave, it's planned until the end of August. I'm jobless, slowly looking for a non-corporate interesting R&amp;D job for myself.  


And that's where my planned life changes come in:  
I'm passionate about my work, I consider software to be partly art and craftsmanship. If I'm not deeply in depression, I'm always trying to make my best, to write the code in a way everybody will understand, with minimum of bugs and mistakes. I'm also very passionate petrol head and I have found an open position suitable for myself abroad, in a small company making hyper-sport road legal cars, located in the north Europe.  
It would be an absolute dream job for me. I'm still in the early process of application (but already got some feedback from a project-lead in that firm), haven't had a chat with them yet.My doctor is very strongly against me moving out of my country and starting a new job in a foreign environment. I do understand why, but the thing is, if I would have a chance to have such a job now, I would feel a very strong urge to accept it, since another chance like this might not occur in my life. Maybe, if I got the chance and didn't use it, I'll happen to be a father in year or two, completely ruining any of my professional ambitions that are attracting me to that job. I see this as the one-time chance that could get me closer to where I want to be and I'll feel sorry if I miss it.  
My question is: can you think of any arguments I could use to make my doctor ""softer"" about this? The company I'm interested in is in Sweden, I would except that the health system in that country is much more advanced in my post-soviet home land. I'm trying to think of things I could propose to my doctor to allow me to go: attending therapies (group at best) every week or so, visiting psychiatrist as often as I can, having a crisis plan (ask for hospitalization as soon as I recognize symptoms of going down/up...).

56,"I've been dealing with mental health issues as long as I can remember.

I can't remember a day in my life I didn't feel the nagging anxiety, or the cloud of depression seeping in.

I'm doing okay at the moment. But I can feel another wave closing in.

On top of anxiety, depression, ADHD, and aspergers. I have a few speculated ones. Borderline bipolar and PTSD. There's others but I can't remember them.

And it not just mild stuff. It's pretty severe. I've gotten pretty good at coping. But just cuz you can resist the urge to off yourself, doesn't mean your doing okay.

When I was six, my best friend. And first ever actual friend, died. That was when I was first put on anti depressent and anxiety meds.
Off and on for the next five years. Then none until now. 

I'm 15. Random anxiety/panic attacks caused by things I can't figure out. Triggers I can't find. Keep me up for days.

My mom is finally really trying to find me an actual phycatrist. After not the fact that upon taking the mental health exam thing during a checkup at the doctor's, the doctor wanted to admit me to a the nearest pych ward.

Nope.

It was when I stayed up for near two days. Only managed to sleep 3 hours woke up to a panic attack caused by my neiceses screaming, and then staying up another 30 or so hours., For her to finally realize. That yeah. Her daughter who has been telling her, her brain is fucked. Has a fucked up brain.

I'm simultaneously Happy it's finnaly on the track to getting taken care of but also upset that it took me being at the lowest I've been since I was six. Dealing with being bullied and my bff dieing.

this post is a mess and probably doesn't make any sense, i sound like an idiot, the grammar is very off but even after getting it out i'm still aching and i still feel like i'm choking on it and the physical pain from it didn't stop. idk kf this is a rant or a cry for help. and idk if i'm evil or simply stupid. i need help. i'm toxic. this is toxic.",01Aug2019,4

I was a happy happy kid, I haven't had any trauma as a kid nor through my teenage years. All I could remember is that I was overthinking things throughout my whole life. Three years ago, I was laying in my bed and something just struck me, I felt panic and I wanted to vomit. After that, I had experienced a lot of nights where I just couldn't be peaceful and when I get to a point of vomiting it got better after I vomited. Three years after that, I have worked a lot on myself. My confidence is better and I quit smoking after 8 years of consuming cigarettes. It seems like a lot of things changed, but I don't feel like I used to. I am not sure that I could define the things that I feel. Panic still happens occasionally, but I kinda learned how to overcome it. Every time it seems like I am going to lose my mind, and it lasts for three years. I just feel distant at night, I look around myself and I just feel disconnected from the world, I get the same feeling in my stomach every time it happens, I feel like im going to vomit and I feel fear, even though it passes every time. My thoughts are constantly bothering me, its always like my mind is telling me that something is very wrong, that I won't ever be normal nor I am normal, I wont be able to make a relationship with anyone, and that results in a social anxiety where I just feel very bad before going out as I feel that I am not a part of a normal society...",01Aug2019,5

76,"As you can read hello, I’m new and I think I joined out of just feeling like it maybe. I dont know. Last year I got diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, but of course I didn’t think it was on a necessarily bad level. Until I realised that maybe I should see a doctor again this year. My last psychologist was a lovely woman, she was sweet to me and a lot that I liked but my only issue was that, at one point when I got confronted with a situation that really badly put me in a negative mind space 

(a group of so called friends turned out to hate me and were talking about me behind my back. I’m still trying to come to terms with it to this day. But hey, apparently they did it to like 4 other people. I’m okay with most of them, a lot are really sweet but there’s a particular 2-3 that I’ll always probably never truely forgive, what hurt me is that I thought they were going to be there for me but of course they weren’t, but I’m not surprised)


She told me they likely weren’t ignoring me and didn’t hate me. Turns out they did, guess that’s what my anxiety is useful for. But I realised I had a serious problem when I found it hard to get out of bed, to do school work, to feel motivated, to feel emotion normally, to do anything to help myself, I just constantly felt in a state of daze and like nothing was real and my emotions just felt non existent. So I saw a doctor, they did a test which I doubted the realness of and I got ranked in levels of depression, anxiety and stress as all the highest level. The test just...it didn’t feel right. I didn’t think I was that bad but somehow I was? I don’t think it’s real could it I mean...I’ve had a bad childhood, I did get bullied and racist remarks were made towards me fairly often. But to affect me to this level, is it serious? I’m scared about it frankly and as usual my anxiety will amp up every emotion and thought that crosses my mind. I could go on meds, I don’t know if it’ll help, or make it worse, or do nothing, or do a little, I know it’s a step, but I’m already tired. I’m scared and everything’s on my mind at once. In this world of technology I find my deepest insecurities but also my sweetest comforts here. That’s my addiction I suppose. But I’m glad to make newer friends, even if I need to put up a wall and illusion of confidence and happiness, but switching to my happy go lucky persona is just a reflex. I can’t be sad, I’m the funny and sweet friend. The dependable one aren’t i. Even if no one depends on me in the first place.",01Aug2019,2

81,"Beginning June 2018, I began to “micro dose” with LSD every single day, after I returned to live at home from Spain from Teaching English for a semester in Barcelona, Spain. I am not exactly sure of the amount, but it was around 50-80 milligrams per day, for around 90 days. I did this because it allowed me to transcend my usual anxiety and depression in a way that I never had before. I was also smoking marijuana, frequently. I would say, every other day. 

What exactly occurred and when — and how I ended up in a mental hospital for a month, is why I am writing this narrative. Because these three months have thus since, effectively destroyed my life — or at the very least, my GABA receptors, in my opinion, and thus any real chance I have at a normal life. There are many theories, both professional and from lay persons, and I would like to continue to improve upon those theories, and perhaps find an even better one.

I also was given Ativan as a medication in an Emergency Room and had thus all of my symptoms disappear. I was no suicidal, the constant feeling of panic and fear throughout the day, disappeared, I felt like I could think and write again, and in short, this day in the ER saved me life — because ever since then, it has been a beacon of hope that I can still have one someday.

The first oddity that my family and friends began to notice was that I began typing on Facebook, furiously, for around 6 hours a day. I told everyone I was finishing a book I had been writing, online, and broke it all up into bite size statuses, in imitation of our president. I did this for two weeks, with a week in between in which I visited my grandmother in North Carolina.

I uploaded videos, photos, and told the entire world things about my life I would be reluctant to tell my closest friends. After my friends grew concerned and contacted my family, I began to accuse my father live on Facebook of having been the force the sexually abused me as a child — instead of the force that made sure it never happened again. I accused a professor whom I had been housesitting for of financially exploiting me and not thanking me for supposedly diagnosing his illness. I told the world I was both suicidal and immortal, that I had become LSD, and also much about how much I loved to dance. I was unbelievably happy, terrified, curious, bored — and experienced every single human emotion at a much higher intensity than usual. I was briefly convinced I was the Unabomber and had had my mind erased, and then later on, that we were all immortal aliens, acting as agents as DNA from within. These delusions I believed in, but they terrified me, and I would later talk myself out of them.

I agreed to go into the hospital with the idea of getting a medical marijuana card (I no longer smoke, whatsoever) and was put on a 3 day hold, which turned into a 1 week stay. I was diagnosed with Bipolar I, and I was prescribed Celexa. The medication did help my symptoms, immensely. Like water on a fire of a brain.

One week later, mid-way through after dumping my medication down the toilet, my symptoms returned, and I was taken to a hospital again for 1 month.

There, I was put on a lower dose of Invega, and I was committed for 6 months afterwards (3 months, to live in a group home, mostly because my doctor refused to believe I would take my medication).

I was absolutely okay with the diagnosis, I slowly did began to see how odd I had been behaving, I became extremely close with my family, and I spent the first month in the group home, cleaning it, studying for the Nursing Program I had decided to embark upon (I have a B.A. in English, 3.5), and reading a lot.

After this month is when things began to change. I attributed these changes to being in the group home, but it has been 8 months since I was discharged, and the symptoms have stayed the same. I can no longer feel any difference with the medication, and I did stop taking it. I have not since show any signs of mania, either (honestly, to my dismay — because at least, that would make sense of things) and my depression comes because no matter what I do, or don’t do, I cannot rid myself of the extreme anxiety and fear that I feel throughout the entire day.

I’ve been suicidal for most of the year, and I am very close to going through with it — because no amount of effort or lack of — changes anything in my life.

I began to wake up throughout the night, 5 or 6 times to use the bathroom. I hardly ever had to go, but I couldn’t sleep if I didn’t relieve whatever small amount of pressure there was. I could no longer stand to be alone, and even when I workout, every single day now, I tremble for the first half hour, simply because I am by myself. I insisted that my parents pick me up every single day, and I spent hours, simply being in their presence because otherwise I would be having extreme anxiety / something just shy of a panic attack, every single day and throughout the day.

What have I tried?

Working full time, working part time, going back to school for a CNA class, running 3-4 miles every single day for a week, lifting weights every other day, one hour of meditation every single day for two weeks, yoga twice a day for two weeks, praying, fasting, going to church, talking to my family about trauma, forcibly writing, attending therapy for 9 hours a week in a group, seeing an individual therapist, two different anxiety medications I’ve been given in various ERs (one was a beta-blocker, the other I am unsure about), two different sleep medications including Seroquel, of course, a whole variety of natural supplements and vitamins: St. John’s Wart, L-Theanine, Valerian Root, 5-HTP, chamomile, Benadryl in the daytime and at night (it neither helps me sleep nor reduces my anxiety), Xanax and Klonopin — neither of which hardly made any difference and which I only tried because of my experience with Ativan (which I speak about now as if it was a God)  7 different kinds of Noortropics,  7 different SSRIS (but 2 years prior to any of this, for depression / depersonalization — none of them helped, and it was only ayahuasca that gave me what then felt my life back, allowing me to publish a few short stories and teach English in Spain) marijuana (for sleeping — but it gave me a panic attack), an ayahuasca retreat for 1 month in which I drank ayahuasca 13 times (it neither made me manic nor improved my extreme anxiety / panic whatsoever, I still experience every single day), micro-dosing with magic mushrooms (no effect), dihydromyricetin (which is a Gaba inhibitor and the only thing that provides me any relief besides biking for 5 + hours a day, outside, and talking to a person that entire time, about all of this), taurine, getting back on a mood stabilizer or off of it, practicing mindfulness, making lists of gratitude, drinking 1 beer at lunch (which did as little for my anxiety as Benadryl), for one month never mentioning mental health or any of this and trying my best to move forward, staying with friends overnight, sleeping all day, not sleeping at all, reading all of my old writing — in short, absolutely everything myself or anyone else on the internet can think of in the interest of healing, and only one thing has worked. Ativan

One of my friends was able to give me ten pills of Ativan, which I made last three weeks, during which I passed an online official practice TEAS test, re-created myself on social media, loved spending time with myself, didn’t have any sleeping problems, didn’t have any problems binge eating or with bulimia, didn’t have any nocturia or bladder problems whatsoever, began writing again in the morning, took a road trip to Colorado (where I didn’t even smoke, and was incredibly happy the entire time — not because I was manic, but because I could simply feel and didn’t want to cry throughout the entire day, in short, because I felt, completely cured, and I thought this awful and horrendous, suicide inducing narrative of my life was finally over), spent days mending relationships that I had neglected with only talk of myself and my mental health symptoms (calling friends, writing them letters, re-creating myself on social media, going on photo shoots, making plans to move out of my parents house, always, sleeping well, etc.). After I ran out of the medication, I was no longer even scared to be without it, because for three weeks my entire life had changed and I couldn’t even forsee it going back to hell.

I don’t experience paranoia, I haven’t had any more delusions, I can no longer feel the mood stabilizers making any difference, I was told by a therapist she thought I had drug-induced mania and wasn’t technically bipolar (I don’t care, I just want my life back), I have no desire to do anything in my life but heal myself, I am obsessed with trying to find a natural remedy.

My theory? I experienced LSD-induced psychosis as opposed to mania for 1 month long (as it truly did feel like I was on acid for most of my stay in the hospital), and it damaged my GABA receptors, and my brain is destined to permanently be in a perpetual state of panic for the rest of my life unless I’m on Ativan.

I’ve never enjoyed the idea of psychiatric medication, and yet, I am fully committed to being medicated for the rest of my life.  Literally anything that works I would be okay with.

Here is what I don’t understand: why does only Ativan help? What the hell happened to me to cause all of this? I don’t think I had a seizure, but it doesn’t feel like Bipolar anymore, and more than anything what I want to stress is that I’m just not getting any better.

I’m extremely close to checking myself back into a mental hospital because the ER doc who gave me the Ativan, as well as the few I saw after him, told me they couldn’t / wouldn’t prescribe benzodiazepines, and I’m exhausted. I no longer want to live, because I don’t have any quality of life, and I spend most of my day talking myself out of committing suicide, with the only pleasurable activity I do being the exercise I get, again, every single day. And even the exercise, only helps me for a few hours afterwards (but it does stop the panic attack I feel like I would have every single morning, otherwise).

All day long, I feel like there is an emergency happening in my body — and all day long, I fight this feeling. I know there is no reason to be afraid, but no amount of talking or therapy really seems to allow these words to sink into my biology. I used to be smart, I used to be self-employed as a professional photographer, I used to travel the world and would fall in love with various human beings.

When I take the Ativan, it’s like I am being lifted out of Hell and back into a world of normalcy. I can talk again, no part of me is suicidal, I’m horrified that I ever wanted to commit suicide in the first place, and in short — I want to live, love, and learn again. I have no idea why other benzos don't work — but if they did, I would have obtained them by now (I even tried the dark net, and lost a thousand dollars I had earned). 

I’m aware of the dangers (Alzheimers, cancer, cognitive damage, and addiction) but at this point, if I was promised 40 years — honestly, even 20, without these symptoms every single day, I would take it in a heartbeat. I’ve also read about people who take Ativan every single day for 40 years who don’t experience these symptoms, and I want to be one of these people, more than I have wanted anything in my entire life.

Please help me to understand what happened to me and if there is anything more I can do to make my symptoms, [improve.](https://improve.Is) Is there anything I haven't thought of? Should I just check myself in? The psychiatrist I did see I had stopped seeing after my commitment was over, but the wait time to see her is 4 weeks, and even if I did see her, the impression I was given by the ER docs was that it would be extremely unlikely anybody would every prescribe me a benzodiazepine. 

I'm 26 btw, and I apologize immensely about the lack of cohesion and or narrative throughout all of this. Please feel free to pm me.",01Aug2019,1
82,"Are there any good group chats that people are on that I could join? I was down for a long time, but now I’m starting to get my confidence back.

I ballooned by 20 pounds the next 4 months. My mental health declined, my depression worsened, and my distrust in people grew. I was in a bad place. My family was there for me. I didn’t really have many friends before that anyways, but this accident helped me realize that I needed to surround myself with more positive people in my life.

84,"My younger sister (21) has Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm not blaming the disorder for I (24) also have BPD. The problem is that she doesn't want to manage it and instead takes it out on everyone around her.

There was a lot of abuse in my childhood because of this but then we went to university and I wasn't physically around her beyond occasional family gatherings. Now we have both finished and are home and it is all resurfacing. To cut a long story short, she can't stand me or my older sister (25) getting any attention from our parents. If our parents so much as speak to one of us she becomes enraged and lashes out. Her lashing out isn't just in the form of screaming and crying she is also highly destructive and violent. 

My parents can no longer talk to us without her - for lack of a better word - going apeshit. They think that putting her in a mental hospital is out of the question but she refuses to acknowledge what she's doing and instead blames everyone us. She's already undertaking DBT and taking anti-depressants but none of these seems to make a difference because she's not willing to put the work in.

I can not controll the smells, they come randomly. The  frequencies of the smells varies from day to day, week to week, or month  to month. 0 - 7 times a day.

I don't know if this is a real  smell, or me just imagining it. It came when I had depression aswell as  anxiety, about a year ago. The smells later became the main issue of my  mental health, and effected me hugely.

Since 5 years ago I  started worrying about my oder. But the smells didn't exist back then. I  would not say that I smell bad regularly, sometimes I even get  compliments about my oder, and I shower everyday.

During  summerbreak the smells dissapeared, but now that school is closing in  they've returned. I'm not that nervous about it, it's a new school and  class though.

Is the smells actual smells, or just in my head?

87," I feel so aimless and worthless. I finished college and now I will be moving away with fiance for his work (for 2ish yrs) , which is a great opportunity.

I wish I had more friends and family around here and I'm really worried about moving. My peers are doing things like medical school and I feel like such a loser. I don't feel passionate, I have always just done stuff that I'm supposed to. Now I just cook and clean and go to the gym and wait for the days to pass. I feel so worthless and stupid. I tried so hard and got great grades, but I didn't do an internship so I'm passed over for jobs, not that it matters -  I can't get a job anyways. I don't DO anything IMPORTANT and I am starting to feel really down. Just want to vent.

My dad will question the whole move and the relationship etc if I tell them this. My mom doesn't see my concern with having all the free time. I don't want to tell my friends. I feel so alone. My fiance tells me it will be okay and that I'm wonderful but I still have so much worry. I feel like such a pointless sack of shit. Always destined to look at others and think they have it going on. 

I know I can still do grad studies etc later but academia is so hard to crack and so many people end up with a degree and still nothing to come of it. 

I don't feel like I have the flair to make it. So young and too nice and not taken seriously and saying dumb shit because I am excited etc.

94,"Hello guys, I am new here I will be glad to hear your opinions and help me better understand my boyfriend because I don't feel like I'm helping hims. He has general anxiety and (in my opinion) mild OCD. I don't think he has been diagnosed by a specialist (at least not in the last 5 years). He has been taking 200mg of sertraline daily for more than a year now. Initially he had started taking it for depression as his girlfriend at that time had cancer which I can imagine was very tough (ex girlfriend is healthy now, for the record). To make the situation worse he's living in a foreign country now with me, he doesn't speak the local language and he's not a very social individual. Lately he has been having less work than usual so he stays home and doesn't really do much through the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently he has been feeling really, really down and says sertraline is not helping him as it used to. He's looking into ways to switch his medication but it's hard to seek medical help largely due to the language barrier. I am very insistent as I know that this type of meds is the worst to experiment with and that's essentially what he's suggesting.  

&amp;#x200B;

He's now at the point where he's very determined to do it and has reduced sertraline to 50mg a day so he's starting to experience some nasty side effects - dizziness, depression and anxiety episodes, stomach pain etc. He is very irritable and just lays on the couch and scrolls his phone for hours.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't want to take advice from me which I kinda understand - I haven't been through even 1% of what he has been through and I only know that he will be dysfunctional without medication from his personal record. But being a kind and loving girlfriend I want to give him all of the help and support so he becomes better. Do you have any advice and suggestions? Approaches? I'd appreciate to hear your experience especially if you're managing those disorders yourself. What would you do if you were me? What should I avoid doing?

I am mediating, trying to protect my husband from further verbal abuse, but also trying to help my father-in-law understand the suffering his son is experiencing.

My husband has written what he would like to hear from his parents:
A. Our treatment of our son has been at times selfish and self-centered. 
B. Our insensitivity to (1) the harm we did to him and to (2) his resulting suffering is beyond obliviousness- it is cruel and re-traumatizing.
C. On some levels we do not care that we have negatively impacted him and his life, because we mostly care about whether or not and to what extent he says that he loves and forgives us. 

His mom has agreed to the above, but his father will only agree to the first item. I have gone back and forth 6 times and he is not willing to budge. I could get specific and spell out incidents of abuse that prove these statements are accurate, but then I risk narcissistic injury and he will most likely side-step me and go after my husband.

111,"Hey everyone, first post here but I could use some help getting on the right path.

I'm a pretty big stoner, the only times I'm not smoking are when I'm at work or if I'm away from the house. Otherwise I'm probably high. I've smoked consistently for the last few years and at this point it doesn't affect me like the typical person who just started smoking, but more like it calms me down and is relaxing.

I've smoked often since I got into weed during college but it became a throughout the day, every day thing when my father passed away a few years ago. Once I got over that for the most part, it just became so routine to smoke all the time and without it my mind races everywhere and I get depressed.

I'm a big advocate for marijuana and the benefits it can bring to your life, but it's just not helping me out the way it used to. It's great for temporary relief but I can't smoke like this for the rest of my life. Problem is I can't bring myself to stop either. There are so many creative things I'd like to do like write stories and get into digital art, but most of the time I'm too high to give a shit about it. But if I don't smoke, I get too in my head/feelings to give a shit about it. I've become so reliant on weed to deal with my mental health that I'm not sure how I would cope with some things without having that external influence.

I don't necessarily need to cut weed out of my life entirely, but I want to become incredibly less reliant on it. I don't really want to see a therapist because that's just not my thing and I don't want to be baited into prescription medication to find happiness in my life. So really my question is, especially for people who used to smoke a shit ton, how do you find your happiness in life? How do you overcome your inner voice and be productive without the use of external things (like weed, coffee, energy drinks, etc.)? I've become so reliant on weed to deal with my mental health that while I realize reasons I need to ween off, I'm honestly a little scared to because I don't know how to deal with myself without it if that makes sense.

But ever since I went to another school I really started to miss them. And every time I was with them I had this weird unexplainable feeling. It almost feels like being in love. But completely different. My heart starts to beat faster and stuff.

But most of all I just feel safe or something? And my head is so much lighter. I also feel so much more relaxed and less tense and less panicy. And everything just feels so much that It almost feels like I'm gonna cry.

And It really confuses me. And I don't understand it. Most of the time I just feel almost nothing or just feel miserable. I just don't understand my emotions, and this particular one confuses me a lot.

I only have this when I'm with my group of amazing friends, that actually support an understand me.

&amp;#x200B;

But does someone else have this to or can explain what I'm feeling?",01Aug2019,2
116,"This has literally happened in the past hour. I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like it's my fault. I could've helped. 

I live in a shared house. We all have mental health issues. I have depression and anxiety and the person I get along with has bipolar. 

I came home from work and spoke to him. He seemed ok. He said he's having a shit day but he's been saying that everyday for the past few weeks. 

I went to my room to relax and he went into the bathroom. He shouted me and asked me to grab a towel from his wardrobe which I did but as I came out of his room I saw blood on the floor and asked if he's accidentally cut himself (he does a lot of phone repairs so has a lot of tools) he said yeh and we went out ways. 

10mins later I go down stairs and he follows me, barely able to walk. I asked if he needed an ambulance and he mumbled no. 

20 mins later I hear a bang so I go to check on him. He's on the floor mumbling. I call an ambulance and the police because he's fighting me to get pills. He said he had already taken 50 diazepam as well as the rest of his meds. I'm on the phone to emergency services. I'm fighting him, trying to stop him from doing more damage, holding the drawers closed so he can't get more pills. 

Because I'm holding the drawers closed he gets up to grab knives. He's trying to open them, I tell him to pass them to me so I can open them which he believes and I flung them across the room so he can't get them. He stands up but barely, walks to where I threw the knives and opens them. 

I can't get the sound of the knives tearing through his skin over and over again out of my head. 

He walks back to me and fights me to get the drawers open and succeeds. He downs more pills that I try to fight off him. That's when the police arrive. 

He's been taken to hospital and will probably be ok. He kept apologising to me over and over when the police arrived and then he said he wants to die. 

I can't get it out if my head. The noise of the blades ripping through his skin on his arm. 

I feel like it's my fault. I didn't do enough. I didn't fight back enough to keep him safe. It's all my fault. 

When he was talking to the paramedics I went in to check on him and he said ""that's whit, she's my special friend, she looks after me"" and my heart sank because I didn't do enough to prevent it. I'm the reason it happened. I didn't see the signs. It's my fault.",01Aug2019,1
117,"First time posting on reddit. 

I'm a male and have a problem with ""pee shyness"" or paruresis since puberty and its very hard to deal with. I just got back from vacation with my family and like usual traveling was terrible because of pee shyness. Its so bad I cant pee when my family is outside our hotel room bathroom, so its basically impossible to go in a public bathroom even when its empty. I don't feel that shy around people so I have no idea why this happens. I know its not a prostate issue either because when i'm home and alone I pee fine. I've tried all the tricks I read online like holding your breath or counting but they are no use. I'm tired of faking that I forgot something in our hotel room just so I can pee alone or holding it in for 7 hours almost bursting but still not being able to go if someones around or even avoiding going out with friends because I know I might need to pee. Its stupid because I know its all in my head and nobody really cares if i'm peeing or not but I still cant get over it.

119,"Hi everyone!

This is kinda long, but it basically boils down to ""how much of my social sensitivity do i share with my significant other"".

My bf and I have been in a LDR for 1.5 years now. It was long-distance from the beginning, we're both pretty busy people so we have similar schedules, and started to go see each other every 2 weeks.

For about half a year now, we happen to hang out with other people during our weekends more and more. Last week we were in a different city where he has three girl friends. We met all of them, I already knew one of them, and one was the reason for the trip to that city as she was getting married.

Whenever we hang out with other people I get very aware of what's going on ""intersocially"" and I'm not quite sure to which extent I should tell him about these things.

Two examples:

1. when we were at the one friend's wedding, there was a photo booth. He managed to get the bride (his friend) for a quick shoot there and I offered them they could have a photo of just the two of them so that I would stand back. His friend immediately denied and said ""You belong to him now, of course you're coming on the photo!"" and I really appreciated that. In retrospect I was disappointed/anxious though because it had been her saying it, not my bf.
2. we met one of his friends for coffee. Sat down at a table. I sat down first, he sat down next to me, his friend sat down opposite of him. Just him. At some point they had a long-ish conversation between just the two of them and suddenly I couldn't stop thinking how I was completely ""unnecessary"" there, because if I had turned invisible all of a sudden, it would just have been them sitting exactly opposite each other. I was kind of left to the side.

Both are situations that I know I notice because of social anxiety and a heightened sense for questioning other people's motives, but I don't know how to deal with it. Do I tell my bf about how I felt in these situations or do I just book it under ""it's your mental illness, deal with it""? He has been very receptive in the past, but also admitted to feeling pressure not to trigger me and becoming insecure in how to act with other people because he never knows what might set me off.

I don't want to pressure him, but I also know my emotions are generally valid, but I ALSO know that some emotions are just mental illness speaking... it's so confusing and annoying and ahhhh any input is appreciated!",01Aug2019,4
120,"I live with my mom and my brother. I moved back home after my father was diagnosed with cancer. He passed away about three years ago. I stayed because I managed to get a good job here and wanted to be with my mom and brother.

Now my brother always had issues that he has refused to deal with. He gets angry very often and has OCD. His OCD feeds his anger in a a way. If everything isn't the way he wants it to be, then he'll get angry and start shouting at the top of his voice until he gets his way. Until last year, we had managed to keep the fragile peace by complying with everything he says. Talking to him to seek help is useless. It has only led to more shouting.

Recently he has taken a turn for the worse. He got angry over something that happened at least 20 years ago. That's not a typo. He got angry over some criticism our mom made about his studies when he was in third grade. He started that fight three days ago. He calms down for a bit, behaves like the funny, sweet boy he can be but then invariably goes back to being the scary, angry guy. He has hit me and mom - kicks, punches and with a shoe. He got hurt during this when mom tried to stop him from punching me on the head. He got a single scratch on his hand. And it got worse from there. He's completely convinced that his hand is going to become infected and it'll need to be removed. Nothing convinced him otherwise - not even a phone call to the family physician. He only calmed down a bit after mom and I agree to cut ourselves on our arm- both of them. You can probably imagine our state of mind at this point. We agreed just for some peace. 

I'm completely defeated now. I just want this to stop. He screams all sorts of profanities at us - some true but mostly false. Hideous things that I don't want to repeat here. Things shouted so loudly that I'm sure everyone in our neighborhood have heard. I want to die of embarrassment but mostly of fatigue. Everyday I find myself dreading the moment he wakes up. I'm getting lesser and lesser amount of sleep because I want to enjoy the few house of peace when he's not awake. 

Leaving home is not an option because mom would never agree to abandon him and I could never leave her alone with him. She want to me leave - she's always urging to get a job somewhere else or get married. But how could I possibly do that? Sending him to a mental institution scares us because the facilities are terrible here in India. I don't know what to do.

My question is : Are they right about denying me things like that ? I really get offended when they take actions meaning that i am an inferior person and I cannot make basic decision.. I keep telling myself that all of this will change when I get to work and I will be completely independent but it's too early ( I am still studying Engineering)..

124,"I’ve been using this supplement for around one week almost and the changes I’ve experienced with my anxiety (due to trauma) is really wonderful. 

Note: I am also seeing a therapist, I don’t recommend only using this supplement 

I take it pill form but it’s naturally found in green tea. No side effects except sleepiness the first day I took it and the only thing you cannot take it with is low blood pressure medication as L-theanine relaxes the body and lowers the heart rate. 

I got mine from the grocery store, and there are a lot of different brands that sell it, and have been taking it at 100mg three times a day with my meals 

My anxiety isn’t gone but it helps me to manage and not panic or fall into depression after an episode of anxiety 

I’ve noticed my productivity has increased as well. 

I will update you guys as I continue to use it as it’s still been very recently I began this supplement but I would highly recommend it.

129,"Hey,

 I hope it’s ok for me to post this here, I haven’t posted much on reddit. I am sorry if this is the wrong place.

I am married to a wonderful man. He is so kind and intelligent and funny. We have been together for 7 years and married for almost 3. I love him so much. He has always struggled with anxiety and depression and has trauma from his childhood. Now, things have gotten worse.

This winter he got a job two hours away from where we live and moved there to work for a period. I knew he was having a bit of a hard time but I didn’t realise how bad things were. Earlier this summer he called me and told me he had been taken to a doctor by a person at his workplace that he confided in and that he has been having a psychotic episode and hurt himself. He got sickleave from his job, moved back here and started treatment. The doctor he is seeing told me he believes he has delusional disorder/ paranoid psychosis (we use the ICD 10 here, I don’t know if these diagnosis is very different from the ones in the DSMV). He is on medication but today he was admitted to the hospital for a few days because he seems to be doing worse. He is convinced everyone is talking about him and know about him, he thinks people have observed him or perhaps spied on him and now everyone is against him. Tonight he told me he is worried about me staying in our flat on my own, he is worried someone will hurt be because of him.

I feel so sad. He is so unhappy and there is nothing I can do. I am worried he wont be okay again, and never have the life he wants. I am worried about our future. My family lives far away but I have told them what is going on and they express support and sympathy but they can’t really do much.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this and would like to share with me? Maybe if anyone have any advice about what I can do, or perhaps suggestions for reading or good resources like books? If anyone has experience with this, yourself or a loved one, could you tell me about it and if things got better?

132,"I believe growing up becomes very different. You see and understand things in different ways, I think part of your youthful naiveness is forever stolen from you. You don’t believe in a positive future and that everything will eventually be good because you know that life isn’t a “good vibes only”-shirt. I don’t recall the endless amount of times I looked at people my age partying or living their life and felt so terribly old and bitter. Something about the way they faced and saw life was so precious, the way only young, untouched people can see the world and the future. I wish I’d grown up to see the world differently too. I wish I hadn’t spent so many years of puberty hating myself and wishing I was someone else. I’ve missed out on so many experiences and it alienates you so much from those around you. It is so hard to communicate these feelings if they’re not reciprocated and not understood. It almost feels like a burden to carry wounds and stories a young person shouldn’t be carrying. It’s like the burden to be expected to be _young_ when you have seen things and things have been done to you that should never ever happen to anyone young. Sometimes I feel like you become too much for people very easily. The younger you are, the less people want to hear about all the bad, your bad, and just want to have a good time. But for people like us, who have suffered in whatever way from an early age on, being happy will always be a battle, a goal, something to drive for - not the status quo. I know more about being sad than about being happy. Maybe that’s why I can’t connect to so many people deeply as our experiences from life are so very profoundly different. And our expectations from it too. I will never forget when I told a friend about how dark some times I lived through were and she just simply, apologetically said “I just can’t relate.”. And I felt so lonely in that moment, so foreign and broken. Of course it was the truth and that’s the same for everybody meeting someone who’s never dealt with mental health issues but especially if you’re young, you _long_ for someone to *understand*. And it is _so_ hard to find anyone who understands. And it’s gotten so lonely to always be the one understanding but not being understood. I wish I hadn’t grown old so young.",01Aug2019,10
133,"So this will probably be long, so apologies in advanced.  


So me and my husband have been together for 8 years and married 5 of them. In that 8 years up until recently he's always been as healthy as can be. About a month and a half ago I noticed he started acting a little strange, he stopped going to see friends, he seemed to lose interest in a lot of things. After a few weeks of this I could just tell he wasn't right, he would try to put on a happy face around me but I could tell something was up. So I tried to talk about it with him, and he played it off like nothing was up. Then about a week later I asked if I could use his computer because his desktop is way better than my laptop and it was making me mad because the fucker wouldn't stop freezing. So I boot it up, open chrome and type in my website but browser shows that he recently searched ""I'm feeling depressed and I don't want my wife to find out"". I was shocked, I didn't know what to think about it at the time, so I just let it go for a couple days but it just stayed in my head so I decided I should confront him about it. When confronted with me knowing about that search in his history he finally came clean that he had in fact been feeling depressed. I asked if he was willing to talk about it, and he asked if he could talk about another time when he is ready, which I agree to.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week later he comes to me and says he's ready to talk about it. So he tells me he feels like a shitty person because I make most of the income and he doesn't provide much and he feels like shit because he can't hold onto a decent paying job for long. For some background, it is true that he hasn't held onto a ""well paying"" job for long in his life. He worked at a grocery store for about 5 years including before I met him, then when he moved into me when I was still living with my parents, he tried to work all kinds of ""blue collar"" jobs so he could pitch in for us getting an appartment together and he couldn't hold onto one of them for more than a few months. However I ended up getting a really well paying job so it didn't matter, we were able to get a decent size house in a nice middle class neighborhood, we live comfortably and we still are able to afford to go on vacations and stuff all on my income alone. But he ended up landing a security job that he has worked for almost 3 years now. He doesn't make much money but it provides extra income we typically put to weekend getaways or vacations. Anyhow back to the point, he says he feels like a leech that can't even provide for himself, because he lived with his parents until he moved in with me. And he feels he just transitioned from leeching off them to leeching off me. I told him I don't give a shit about how much money we make because he's been the best husband I could of ever dreamed of. He could not work at all for all I care, he does more than his fair share of the housework, does all the cooking, and always has something fun for us to do. He responded to that I deserve better than someone who has to live of their spouses income. A few days later he also mentioned that his dad(who is an abusive dickhead) always laments that neither of his sons can support themselves and both of them are deadbeats who live on the work of others.(He has an older brother that lives with his grandma and works a min wage job and obviously can't support himself). He mentioned when he was a kid he wanted to surpass his brother but they ended up being the same.   


So here I am now, I don't know what the fuck I should do if anything. Should I try to support him as much as possible? Should I give him space to let him work through it? Should I encourage him to seek out a therapist? I really don't know because he's never been like this before in the 8 years I've been with him.

134,"I’m nearly 23, and female. 

I’ve always worried. I’ve had phobias for a long time. The doctor. Blood. Illness. 
Terrible possibilities run through my mind. The TV falling on my niece. But even though it hasn’t happened to her, it’s happened to other kids, and I can’t stop it and it suffocates me. 
My loved ones getting in a car accident or getting cancer. Even if they don’t, others do, and I can’t stop it. 

When I cook for my boyfriend, thoughts of him getting salmonella or something and becoming deathly ill flood my mind and I want to dump the food out instead. 

When I eat something, I have to check the date. Twice. I refuse to eat, or throw out, food that is probably perfectly good. I obsessively wash my hands. 

When I have a symptom, it’s cancer. Or it’s some abstract disease and I will be forever disabled. Or dead. If my side hurts, I have appendicitis. 

When I think about my niece I think about child abductors and I can’t do anything about it. I can’t protect her. I can’t breathe. 

I might get cancer. I might get in a car wreck and become paralyzed. I may be involved in a shooting. I may be kidnapped. These things may happen to the people I love. I can’t stop thinking about it. 

I understand that logically, these worries shouldn’t influence my life. I understand that while we are alive and well we should live our lives to the best of our abilities and seek happiness. I know worry is the biggest waste of imagination. I know that there is generally more good than bad. But to me, these fears are so real, so tangible, that they sit at the dinner table with me. They follow me into the shower. They sleep in my bed. They sit under my desk. Sometimes I think they are on top of me, crushing me instead. 

I have obscure OCD tendencies. Don’t step on that. Don’t click that. Pour this before that. This must go on that self. Don’t say that word. Or that word. Don’t think about this. Do think about this. Don’t shower too early. Fuck, you’re showering too late. 

What happens if I don’t fulfill my compulsions? Nothing. Except in my head, every terrible thing I fear has somehow found a way to reach me. 

I don’t eat sometimes, or avoid some foods altogether. I want to travel, but what if I get a disease or I get killed? I want my boyfriend to come over, but what if someone hits him with their car I can’t even type this without bursting into tears and I can feel my chest welling up in agony. I don’t really go out.

135,"Hi Folks, Could really use some advice here. 

My husband's sister has four children, all of whom have special needs, and she has been a single mom for over 4 years. The father of these children was a negligent and largely absent father. The kids have been through a lot, no doubt there are abandonment issues, and the pain of seeing their mother struggle financially with a family to support on a daily basis. 

Her second oldest, our niece (14), has a history of OCD, anxiety and depression, and has been self-harming for a while, something I found out a few months ago. We don't see her a lot, but when we do see her, she puts up a facade of happiness and normalcy, not unexpected. Yesterday I learned she tried to commit suicide by swallowing a bottleful of ibuprofen. She was taken to the hospital and is on suicide watch, though is said to be ""doing okay, though a bit sad.""

She lives in a very conservative Catholic home, her grandmother (mom's mom, my MIL, living with them) being the most extreme, plus MIL has the bonus of being a special kind of selfish jerk. Her mother, while Very Traditionally Catholic (no birth control, etc), seems to be more tolerant than her mother, and a sweet and kind person. We don't know where she falls on the issue of gay tolerance. This is important because our niece apparently recently went through a breakup with her girlfriend, so we are learning that she is also probably gay, and we don't know how she is being treated by her grandmother or mother, if this self-discovery is contributing to her anxiety/depression/self-harm, or if she's just heartbroken. Obviously she needs a therapist and probably medication if she's not on any already for the OCD. I just want to visit her and give her a hug and tell her that there are people in her family that want to see her grow into a happy gay adult. However, I don't really know what she has been going through and how to help her get through the next few years, nor do I feel like that would even be welcome.

We aren't close to them mostly because of the religion thing. It's a big deal in their home. I was raised Catholic, but  with a more tolerant view than my husband and his siblings were subjected to (I liken it to Kennedy Catholic vs. Scalia Catholic). My husband is an atheist, I'm agnostic. Neither of us like being around his mother very much and we don't have a lot in common with his sister, either. We do visit on occasion and it's always polite.

Just not sure what to say to our niece when I see her. I want her to feel supported as a person. Obviously I don't support this act, but I also can empathize with the feeling of just wanting to vanish, though I've never acted on it.

Ive been prescribed attivan for panic attacks (but have not experienced them since starting sertraline)  and i have been too scared to take any. Considering it so i stay home tonight. 


If others have felt this/are feeling this please hmu.  I feel like im losing it.",01Aug2019,1
137,"This is a throw away acc. Basically I am looking for any advice someone can give me on seeking help. I have felt my mental health spiraling for the past few years. I am not proud of it but have used weed as my main source of help as it seems to help distract me from the sadness but as soon as I stop it, reality catches up with me. I really just want to help myself. I am lucky enough to live in a country that does offer free mental health care. Although I am not ready to talk in person and am thinking of starting with a text. If any one can give me any advice on how to do this and how counseling has affected your life, whether its positive or negative.",01Aug2019,1
138,"So to date I have missed 8 days this year at work. I’d say 5 of those day were purely because of mental health issues. Being suicidal, not sleeping, and so on. I haven’t been honest with work about it because I’m not comfortable with revealing that and it may just back fire. I personally do not feel like this is a huge issue. Generally there is coverage and really it’s in tow with the HR guild lines. If confronted about it should I just make something up or be upfront. I’m not too serious about the job I just feel other people try and come for you when it’s not if there business. Other people do the same thing so why do I feel so concerned about it?",01Aug2019,3
139,"Hi, I am feeling sad and depressed often because my family, friend, other humans, animals etc will die someday. Every time I find my self in a situation that would be considered enjoyable, meaningful or valuable, like petting my cat or spending time with my family or friends, or watching a good movie, I get the thought that ""this will end one day because I will die and they will die etc"". This always kills my mood (not that it was that great to begin with, due to my depression) and ruin/taints the experience.

I'm not saying that I want everything to last for eternity, I just want to be able to enjoy life and my experiences and find it meaningful without being constantly reminded that everything will end. How do I do that? Is it ""just"" a matter of me to overcome my depression and then it will be better, or am I doomed to have my life and experiences ruined for the rest of my life?

P.S. please be kind.",01Aug2019,2

After some self-reflection I realized I have some very strong qualities. I'm assuming these qualities resulted in my loss of friendships, trust, and relationships. These are the qualities that I have found:

I am very selfish and self absorbed. I don't like sharing things unless the person i share with does the same for me. I don't like helping people just to be helpful. I always want something in return whether it's their kindness, friendship or trust or they just plain give me a reward. I don't care how others feel unless it involves me. I get angry when someone doesn't listen to me or do what I ask, but I also hate being told what to do. I know i can't avoid that because i have to follow orders at work. I like being complimented and having my picture taken, I like it when I have the best item.

Sometimes when I say things I can't tell if it was mean or not, for example one time I was talking with someone and i said ""retarded people are the ones who don't know how to dress themselves. Why do you come here every day looking like that? You look like a five year old, if you want to stop getting made fun of wear something normal."" they then got angry with me. I was trying to help them because I was supposed to do some projects with them and I did not want to present anything in front of people with them. They never dressed appropriately. I wanted great feedback on my presentation.

I've also noticed that I seem to lie to others in order for them to like me. I also get anxiety when i'm in a public place or outdoors. I worry that I am not good looking enough (people like pretty people and people trust the more attractive) I also get anxiety when I have to talk to people. I want to sound intelligent and trustworthy and the thought of not being perceived that way makes me very nervous. I suffer from anxiety alot, and sometimes i get panic attacks for no reason. I usually don't leave my house unless I have to because for some reason leaving my house is terrifying.

I also have a tendency to share my personal problems in order to gain attention. But this post isn't for attention, I just want to know If what I do or think is normal.",01Aug2019,4
141,"Just thought I'd post a nice wholesome story.

When I was younger we had a family friend who was our neighbor for a while. She was pretty old and her husband died before I could really remember him. The rest of her family lived in Florida or somewhere far. Her vision was going and she had arthritis I think. She must have been very lonely but we basically adopted her as an extra grandma and she was at all major events.

Her motto was ""grin and bear it"" which I thought of the other day and it really inspired me to keep going and not quit on my mental health treatment.

Looking back as an adult I realize she must have been so strong to keep going and bring joy to others while living alone with failing health. There are so many kind, lonely people out there that give so much. So now whenever I think I'll never get out of this I'll think of her and be strong.

You're in my heart forever, Helen. Rest easy up in heaven",01Aug2019,3
142,"I dont know why I am writing this in here, but I need to talk to someone about this and I dont want to talk to my Family or Friends.
I'm 17 years old atm and I have been struggling with talking to people ? Like I can't talk to strangers like at all. I dont know if this is normal or just normal shyness, but everytime I have to talk to People I dont know or People I just know for a short amount of time I literally can't open my mouth / can't bring myself to talk like I have some kind of barrier in my head that keeps me from talking. I feel kind of dumb writing this in here, but I feel like I can't talk about this to anyone because everybody just says that i'm shy, but it doesn't feel that way it's just frustrating. I also avoid calling people because of this.
I mean I'm okay with talking to people I already knew for some months or years. Or chatting with People 
This Sounds so dumb tbh....
I just Wanted to know if somebody here has the same Problem ? Or I don't know...if it's normal?

143,"I'm a male aged 18 and i'm lactating. My breasts have never been so sore and as i try to grasp onto the idea of an escape plan from my forever neurotic downer existence, i only seem to be able to close my eyes and fantasize about violence and death, my death, and the death of all the evil doers of the world that make my stomach wither and shrivel up to the point where i spew black goo onto virgin paper. The only thing that releases dopamine in my withered brain is the thought of putting a gun against the roof of my mouth and feel the moist saliva dripping from my palate. But wait, i have not yet become the self destructive rock star that i fantasize about becoming yet. Oh yes, those narcissistic dreams of making a huge record and bringing back rock n roll into the mainstream and then proceed to proudly and sardonically say to journalists that i don't give a shit about this forever awaited accomplishment and that's it's no big deal. Guess i'll just wait. My emotional pain is unending and makes me sarcastically giggle in sheer anxiousness. And i want to burst, implode, and dwell on the empathy that i have for the human race that constantly disappoints me.",01Aug2019,1
144,"I have been to my doctor and was diagnosed with depression. I have medicine but it doesn’t help. I have went back to the doctor since then and they added more MG. It still doesn’t feel like it’s working at all. I feel like I might have something actually wrong with me. I have these weird crying fits but it’s not a panic attack. I hit myself in the head and yell at myself saying “You are worthless! How could anyone stand to be around you!”. I cry so much that I can’t breathe. Sometimes it gets worse... it scares me. I feel like if I tell my doctor how I really feel they will put me in a mental hospital. I can’t do that I just can’t. I have been doing this since 5th grade [Im now 19 turning 20]. The older I got the more I began to hate myself and others. Also I have been wanting to tell someone this for a while.. I have had some people through out my life that I hate very much but I never did anything to them. I have thought of so many things I could have done though. One person was a girl that would bully me for crying at school and much more. I would think about killing her and how I could make her hurt like she hurt me. I would go into very detailed ways of how I could hurt her in my head. I would never in a million years act on it but I would get in a very dark mindset and think about what if I did. I scare myself when I think like this. What is wrong with me? I just wanna know how I can stop this and be normal.
