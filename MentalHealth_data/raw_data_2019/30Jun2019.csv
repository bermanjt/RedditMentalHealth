0,"I have bipolar disorder as well as OCD, and my wife and I both know this well. I am so blessed to not only have her as a wife...I am eternally grateful to her for seeking my confessions about my darkest thoughts and loving me enough to tell me to get myself together and use the tools I have in my bucket. 

One thing I get so terrified of, though, is when I am in a crisis and feel like I’m losing my mind and going crazy. This is nothing new- anxiety began early in life and over the years, I’ve (mostly) learned to accept the struggle and get on the best way I can.

Lately life has been super stressful for me. Our living situation has changed, my work schedule for changed suddenly, our bills are getting higher and I am utterly exhausted, working full-time while also going to college with full-time credit hours. I feel like I surpassed my coping mechanisms and have been struggling with isolating myself and refusing to get enough sleep.

Today my wife asked why I did not reply to her texts about breakfast this morning and why I am isolating myself both emotionally and physically. I really struggled with it, but I told her I thought I was going crazy and couldn’t get out of my own head. She firmly told me that it’s unfair to call myself “crazy” and to instead recognize that life is crazy right now and that we’re in this together. She never once judged me but, rather, told me to use my tools and cease those thought processes.

This was very hard for me because my thoughts are already chaotic as is as times, and I’m afraid of being misunderstood or seen as paranoid. However I know that by talking about it, I won’t be as afraid to be real with others.

Also,  I’m meeting with a psychiatrist soon to go back on some mood stabilizers. I am looking at the options that don’t result in weight gain and libido loss; so I’m hopeful that, in time, I can focus on healthier thought processes.",30Jun2019,59
1,Like it says it’s my birthday and in all honesty I just don’t care. I feel like all this money he spent on me was a true waste and I don’t know how to tell him.,30Jun2019,1
2,You know the paradox that being around other people should help you feel better but you actually feel more alienated? So then you hide away and feel alone and are still trapped in your head. Just want to say hi to someone who understands because I don't know how to reach out to people. Even when I try it doesn't seem to do much. This place feels like a kind of support group that I don't want to go to irl,30Jun2019,6
3,"I'm having no luck with therapy - this is my second time accessing therapy, this time around I've already had to switch therapists once as the first refused me treatment and there was a clear personality clash. I was very clear with the services supervisor that I waned CBT (I want practical help in addressing how I think, rather than merely talking) but 9 weeks into a 12 week stint with the new therapist and I've not seen any sign of CBT. We essentially meet and chat about the week, we're not even really talking about the issues I'm dealing with, he's even said he's unsure how to help. 

Once this 12 weeks is over I have to wait 6 months prior to re-referring, there is then a waiting list which could range from a few months to a year - it will be over a year before I see anyone. In the mean time I suffer severe depression that stops me working or forming friendships and deal with constant suicidal thoughts, due to medical reasons I can't take antidepressants, so for me this means over a year without any form of mental health care...that can't be right!

I know that mental health services are under a lot of strain but there has to be something available or some way to navigate therapy so that I'm not left without any care for over a year. Would it be unreasonable to ask to go to yet another therapist, maybe ask my therapist to talk to his supervisor to say he doesn't know how to help me?

5,My concept of fear has shifted so drastically as I’ve gotten older that it’s bizarre to me. My fear of rejection has vanished. My fear from skating from the norm is gone. Even fear of physical pain and death just doesn’t occur to me anymore. It doesn’t matter if I live or die. It doesn’t matter if I ask someone I like out on a date or not. It doesn’t matter if I shave my head or get a dozen tattoos or piercings. Or start a fight with someone who crossed me. Fuck it. I just go for it because it doesn’t matter. And I don’t know if it’s a normal consequence of getting older or if it’s depression or some inner conscience reflection of the world we live in now. I know I’d rather experience fear than this strange absence that makes me feel like I’m already dead to some degree. I dunno. I guess I’m wondering if other people feel this too. This fearlessness that isn’t bravery. This liveliness that isn’t living. Advice would be nice.,30Jun2019,159
6,"Hello everyone! 

So I’ve done this in the past and I was pretty successful. I want to lend a helping hand to anyone who needs it. I want to hear all of your problems and your woes. Everything. No judgement here. 

A little background on myself. I’m not a doctor. I’m just a man with a wealth of life experiences and a definite battle with mental health. I’ve been in the military, around the world, been through some nasty break ups and some good old family problems. 

So please, feel free to PM me! You, yes YOU! If you made it this far into the post, I want to hear from you.

8,"My friend's brother let's call him John. So John has been through a bad break up(family reasons)  and still kept contact with the girl. The girl is doing good now but over the last six months John has started isolating himself. He can stand in a corner and just stare blankly for hours. 
Over the last three months he has stopped eating properly. The family managed to detox him from the toxic ex gf who kept giving him hope but he is freezing himself out from everyone. 
There are no signs of self harm or alcohol/illicit substance intake. 

He eats maybe just once a day now. Drinks water once a day too. 

He doesn't respond when his sister or mother hugs him back. 

He lost interest in all activities and a fun loving guy is currently just a walking silent person in their house. 


Legally they aren't allowed to force him to seek help. Since he hasn't done anything to qualify as self harm, he still has full rights over refusing mental health help. 


Location is Canada. Any help or advice on how to proceed will be extremely appreciated.",30Jun2019,2
9,"Here is a story.

I was in a children's psychiatric hospital. There was a 13 year old boy with anger issues who claimed he had 7 girlfriends because all he wanted do was fit in after every other guy went around and talked about their past relationships. No one believed him of course. 

Then the counselor watching over us turned to me and asked ""How many have you had?"" Me being 17, the oldest kid in the place, I told the truth.
""None""
""Huh"" he blurted.
""Zero"" I reiterated.
With a scrunched up face he looked at me and asked ""you've never had a girlfriend?"" My heart leaping to my throat and I managed to squeal out my response.
""No, I have never had a girlfriend."" He took a few seconds to reply and those seconds with all the younger boys staring back at me were the most terrifying of my life. That 13 year old kid who was lying before now looked at me with pity his his chestnut eyes. Turning back to the counselor I met his reply.
""Shit, now I see why you are in here.""

I was in there because I was depressed and was having suicidal thoughts. I never had the stuff to do it, never would have and never will. I could never hurt my family that way. But in that moment he made me feel like utter shit. I believe that, for a few seconds, if I had a way to follow through... I would have.

Moral of the story?
Sometimes the people inside are the nicest people just trying to fit in and the people who are supposed to help you are the ones that put you there and keep you held down.",30Jun2019,38
11,"I just thought I’d share a nice story with you guys today! So I’ve been struggling with anxiety for my entire life and have always been cautious to get on any kind of medication for fear that it would change my personality. Friends I told me I was being ridiculous and that the medication would help me but I never listened. Then I had a really rough week in which I was in a constant state of anxiety attack and every little thing set me off- one of the worst weeks of my life. At the end of that week I had a prescheduled appointment with my gynecologist to discuss how my new birth control was helping my (unrelated) pain. My mom came with me- thank goodness- because she told the gynecologist that about my current state and asked if she could suggest anything to help, which is something I never would have thought to bring up. I have course brushed it off and said that I’d get over it soon, but she, now having found out how I really was, would not let me off so easy. 

We discussed my hesitation about medication- I felt like having to take medicine would make me come off as weak. She described it like this: everyone has a well. Some people have wells that are constantly full and never need to be refilled. Other people have wells that are a little more shallow, but fill back up soon enough. Then there are people whose wells frequently run dry, and no kind of rain could ever hope to fill the well quick enough to draw water from it. The medicine acts as a refill, like a firetruck coming to the rescue for the townspeople. The water is just as natural as rain, the only difference is how I got there. 

Since starting my prescription, I haven’t had a single anxiety attack. I moved hours and hours away from home to the biggest city in America, and have yet to feel the heavy weight of anxiety pull me back into that state. My mom saw our gynecologist today and she was so happy when she heard about how I’m doing, she started jumping up and down and gave my mom a big hug and double high-fives.

12,"Like, 2 years ago, I thought I had a brain tumor for some reason, due to symptoms like my eyes blacking out, headaches, eye floaters, etc.

Now it’s back, and I had some mini-mental breakdown because I forgot the name of my girlfriend for a few seconds, and like, yeah I have a few weird issues, the left side of my head feels weird at times, and shit like that. Before the anxiety came back I just had the occasional headache, but now? I don’t know what I should do.",30Jun2019,1
13,"I'm currently in having some struggles with work, and I would like to hear opinions about what would be good options.

I've been working as a dishwasher at a restaurant/bakery for a little over two months for summer work before my third year at college, currently working full time.  I thought I would get used to things and feel less fatigue, but now I spend around two hours every day laying down after work and have little energy to do much of anything for much of the night.  The work environment itself is rather stressful at times too, and having Generalized Anxiety doesn't help matters much.  It's not clean work, and involves a fair amount of lifting and running around. I've taken three breaks in the past month (breaks aren't required by law in the state I live in), so I don't really get a chance to eat.  Part of that is my fault, since I'm responsible for finding time to eat, but sometimes it's just not possible, since it's often busy.  

I'm very tired of having little to no energy to do things I enjoy, and I often dread coming into work.  But for some reason I'm also afraid to quit, or that maybe I'm being too sensitive or too weak. And it has been a good opportunity, I'm just unsure if it's a good fit anymore. I just don't really know what's normal and what's unhealthy anymore.

15,"So, i've been on here before talking about my own issues in the past, i still struggle, but i'm getting by, however, this post is mostly one to look for advice on what i should do for my friend (ill call him B)

B has been my friend since like, 5th - 6th grade, i consider him a brother, but he wasn't always a he, B has gender dysphoria (FtM, no surgery) and it causes some issues for him, on top of that, he was also diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and psychosis, which i'm not sure is the right diagnosis, i feel like its Bipolar with psychotic symptoms, but i cant be sure. His whole time he tried to get help, he was given mood stabilizers and anti-depressants, from the same psychiatrist who diagnosed him with psychosis, hes never even been on an anti-psychotic, that's one thing that baffles me a bit.

He vents to me every day just about and its starting to wear me down, he talks about the voices he hears berating him and telling him awful things in terms of gender, his abilities to do things, his friendships, and they tell him to take his life, he can't get any relief from them, on top of this he has some trauma from 2 abusive relationships hes been in in the past, one particularly worse than the other, not physical, but emotional and mental.

His mother is a narcissist who treats him awfully and shows barely any love, she talks bad about him to the psychiatrist to get them on her side instead of his, and worse part is, it works, she describes it in a way that makes it sound like normal teenager issues, when its not. He doesn't feel safe telling our case worker or his psychiatrist in a deep fear that he'll be made fun of, even though i've reassured him that wont happen, he acknowledges that it probably wouldn't, but he still holds heavy doubts.

He tells me about him wanting to self harm and has told me about how he relapsed back into cutting. I tell him to talk to our case worker or his psychiatrist constantly, but i don't think he wants to, he told me that if he told them everything, he'd be sent back to a hospital, and his mother would be abusive to him for the hospital bill, he constantly thinks that im gonna abandon him and i just, i dont know what to do anymore, he doesnt want to get help for himself, if this keeps up for any longer, the next time i see our case worker, im gonna tell her, but i dont know if i should tell her everything or just some of it, im stuck between a rock and a hard place here because all i want at this point if for B to be ok, but i dont want him to hate me if i end up getting him hospitalized.

What the fuck do i do? It brings me down whenever he tells me these things i cant do anything about, he doesnt want help, he's told me that, he told me he just wants to leave, i dont know what i should do, but it feels obvious that i need to tell our case worker. i just, i needed to vent a little bit as well as seek advice, has anyone been in this type of situation before? and what did you do to help your friend?

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had recurring dreams of someone holding me down and kissing my neck. In the dream I’m struggling to get the person off me but I can’t and I feel trapped. I don’t enjoy it and I always wake up feeling traumatized and disgusted. The dream feels really real and like it’s actually happening to me in real life.

Additionally, I hate having my neck touched and I have a fear of being kissed on my neck. I get scared when people even go near my neck. When I see something on TV where someone is kissing someone’s neck I feel so repulsed it makes my skin crawl.

I don’t know if I’m making a bigger deal than it is but I’m starting to seriously worry that it might be because I was sexually abused as a child and that I’ve been repressing the memories or something.

22,"I haven’t seen a doctor since I was 15 years old. I’m finally going to see one in a few days because I’m having problems getting my stuff together. I dropped out of highschool because I couldnt pass my classes or pay attention no matter how much I tried. It was never my intent to drop out but school seems impossible. I couldn’t never sit in my chair I was always moving around talking to my friends teachers telling me to sit down, stop talking, etc. I want to do certain things like get a job finish school and go to college but it seems near impossible because I can’t concentrate in school. Except for my gym class. Always got 90s. Knowing all of this how I dropped out makes me saddened to where I don’t want to do anything but sit at home and play video games. I get social anxiety sometimes to the point where I start sweating, when people are talking to me it’s almost like my mind seems to drift off and start thinking about things that are completely unrelated. In school, the final draw was when I noticed a persistent problem where the whole class would be listening to the teacher read a paragraph and ask us to recite what some of it means or what it means and id be completely lost. I dont have the best memory either. I wanted to know how if it would be in my best interest to talk to my doctor about adhd.

27,"     I’m a very paranoid person.  I’ve been paranoid since a very young age.  I’ve done everything I can to put mind at ease.  I can’t go to therapy or take medication for my issue considering I have no way of taking myself to a therapist or getting medication on my own.  I’m usually not taken serious by my family members when I tell them my genuine issues.  They think I’m dumb for being scared of things that aren’t even there.  I’ve had conversations where I’m ignored, get an eye roll, or they just walk away.  

     There are a lot of restless nights and days where I feel very uneasy.  I shake a lot and do not like when there is an empty space behind me or on both sides of me, but I also don’t like being cornered.  I am also quite claustrophobic.  I need things to be insight at all times because I don’t want there to be something or someone there that I can’t see and am completely unaware of.  I hate being alone.  Especially at night.  

     At night I do not leave my room whatsoever.  I cannot stay in a completely open area it’s too much for me.  I either stay in my spare room to watch tv on the flatscreen or I stay in my room and watch Netflix or YouTube on my laptop.  Although the spare room makes me very uncomfortable (as referenced in a previous post on r/confessions), my room and the spare room feel almost the same at night.  My whole house becomes very scary and uncomfortable for me when the sky becomes dark.  (Side note: It is 10:36pm and as I am typing this.  It’s currently storming.  I’m very scared there is going to be a power outage.  I can’t even handle those when it’s light out let alone DARK).  I don’t even speak at night unless I’m on the phone.  I try my hardest to listen to everything going on in my home to make sure nothing bad is going to happen.  I keep the sound on my tv and laptop low.  I don’t move much.  I make sure my breathing is kept at a very low level even at the scariest times.  Even when my heart is racing and I feel like I can’t breathe.  I’m absolutely terrified.  I get like this even during the morning.

     During day time when I’m home alone, i don’t like being in open areas or outside my room, just like at night.  Although I do leave my room when I have to.  If my parents want me to clean the house, I do it.  Although it does take me a very long time to do so since I’m scared I can’t focus on what I’m doing.  When I eat breakfast or lunch I with either eat in my room or I will place a dining room chair up against the wall so I can see all my surroundings.  I make sure my dogs are around me at all times.  Especially when I’m doing dishes.  A task as simple as showering is difficult for me home alone or at night.  I only shower when my parents are home or when I’m feeling safe, which is quite rare.  When I do leave my room, I try to be ask quick as possible.  I always go back within 5-10 minutes.  I can’t stand being out of my room if no one I trust is present.  Otherwise, I feel like someone or something is watching. 

     No matter where I am in my home I always feel like there is someone or something watching me.  Maybe that’s normal for some people, but it’s a constant fear for me.  I feel like they are waiting for me to make a move that will make me vulnerable in that moment and catch me completely off guard with no one around to hurt me.  Much like sleeping.  Sleeping is very difficult for me to do.  I can lay here for hours on end but my fears keep me awake at night.  I often times cannot sleep until sunrise.  (For some reason 7am feels like the safest hour for me which doesn’t make sense in any way. It’s a very comforting time for me.) it ruined me my freshman and sophomore year.  

     During my freshman and sophomore year I sometimes didn’t get even 30 minutes of sleep before going to school the next morning.  There were other times where I would eventually fall asleep, but I’d wake up late for my bus. (I only just started riding the bus to school freshman and sophomore year.  I’ll most likely be riding it my junior year as well). I’ve had to walk 2 hours to school multiple times.  I would often miss my first period class and sometimes both my first and second.  I lost a lot of time in those classes.  Eventually around the end of my sophomore year I was put on melatonin so I’d sleep at night.  I was still very scared, but it worked for and I became extremely exhausted around 10:30 every night barely able to keep my eyes open and think.  I was on it for 2 months until falling into a deep depression because of the melatonin.  I then stopped.  I’m too afraid to take melatonin, but now my fears are taking control again.  I’m often very sleep deprived.  I’m very scared all of the time. 

     I’ve been paranoid almost my whole life.  It’s really hurting me.  There were days I’d come home from school too afraid to open my front door.  I don’t like looking at still faces at night because often times they become very distorted.  I don’t like looking in mirrors either.  Sometimes my paranoia drives me into crying fits.  I sweat, breathe heavy, have heart palpitations, and overall freak out.  I become extremely frantic.  I don’t know what to do. 

     Just a small note why I can’t do anything serious about it: I very recently mentioned to my parents all my problems with being too scared to leave my room, when I’d have problems opening doors, afraid of being home alone, and how it would keep me up late at night.  They kinda nodded their head and rolled their eyes as they looked down in disappointment.  I told them “I know it sounds stupid but this is serious” and they just told me “yeah.  It does sound stupid.”  It’s not that my parents don’t care or love me.  I think they’re scared.. maybe they don’t believe me.  I’m not sure what to do.  I’ve done all I’m capable of doing.",30Jun2019,1
28,"i feel really upset. i feel like my mother doesn't love me at all. and she isn't a good mother. she is so selfish for a mother. she has made me live with an abusive brother for years. and when i finally told her that its enough that she needs to do something, she pins all the blame on me. she says im making life difficult for her. she says to just live with it. but shes my mother shes not supposed to make me live with someone abusive. she's supposed to help me. she keeps on making this about her and how im ruining things for her when she's the one who is telling me to normalize his abuse, she's the one who is making me feel bad when its her who is not doing her job. if she can't realistically do anything about my abusive brother than i can still understand but she's still insistant that its all my fault. its not fair i feel like my own mother doesnt care about me. my own mother doesn't care about my concerns, she doesn't care how I feel but is pinning it on me.


She promised me that she would do something about him but she never did. I try not to tell her about this but she screams at me and blames me and makes it all about her, she tries to normalize his abuse. She tries to normalize abuse for her own daughter.


So I told her fine I'll live with it but when I move out [WHENEVER I MAKE THESE POSTS PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MOVE OUT I CAN'T TILL ATLEAST 2 YEARS]. But then I told her I suffered in your home so Im going to resent you for it but she still blamed me.

I can't win, if I speak up she tells me I'm making her life hard, if I live with it (while suffering) and then naturally resent her I'm a bad daughter. Its impossible for me to win, either way Im going to be the bad one, even if  I suffer in silence.

31,"I experienced trouble sleeping in the past, so I saw a psychologist. It wasn't getting better but worse, the feeling was what is described as what I now know is a panic attack and it would occur as I got into bed. The panic attacks got worse before bed and more often, and I started to feel that dissociated feeling during the afternoon along side the other symptoms (during the afternoon I felt the dissociation the most, in bed the physical symptoms were the worst. The psychologist sent me to the psychiatrists and turns out I had ADHD, which was extremely correct. I had a strong case and now feel like my brain is ""free"" if that makes sense. If anyone wants to hear some of my theories I have come up with just ask. Anyhow, the panic got a lot worse, I felt very disconnected from the real world even though I had a lot of mates and family who did actually care. Each theory I devised was based in fact, but made me feel like life was even more fake, like I was that lucky it didn't make logical sense. The math behind my existence happening at all on top of the good things that were happening to me didn't add up. I convinced myself I had schizophrenia at one point for one afternoon (which had a strong point to how I felt and stuff that has happened over my whole life ([https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bzam9n/translating\_what\_is\_happening/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bzam9n/translating_what_is_happening/) this is the other expericances). This was when I looked at a panic attack fact sheet. It perfectly explained everything and I had a conclusion, that I had been experiencing panic attacks the whole time. With this I stopped my medication until I next saw my psychologist, and the symptoms I had felt of the medication became obvious and the ADHD medication just amplified this feeling drastically. I talked to my psychologist and physicist and neither of them quite understood how bad I felt during these times. I started to doubt myself as well, I was still feeling these panic attacks before sleep and that feeling like something was wrong a lot of the time, but when everything was good I felt like I was faking it, like I wanted to feel bad for myself, like I just wanted medication. During panic attacks these beliefs instantly fell apart as I felt like I had a broken mental state. These panic attacks happen often enough to bother me and I stay awake until I'm tired enough to fall asleep in like 10 minutes (usually 1-2 am). The final thing is that the panic is bad but not as bad as the other cases i hear of, I can move and I can socialize will having a panic attack, but it is extremely painful. However the therapy isn't helping, I think that because it isn't a severe case that I don't need or want medication, but therapy isn't working. I'm also having trouble with whether panic twice a week is even a disorder or just panic.

Pretty much, I feel odd, disconnected and that something is wrong which is killing my standard of living. I have on occasions during panic attacks, had suicidal and came to a ""logical"" conclusions that suicide would be the only permanent fix. To be honest I'm scared of what I'll become and what my future will be like, if it was continue to how worsen as it does now I don't know what I'll do. I feel hopeless and don't know what question I'm asking. And will probably end up deleting this post once this panic attack stops.",30Jun2019,1
32,I feel constantly in a catch 22 between feeling like I'm asking for pity by sharing my problems and alone for not sharing them. It's fucked.,30Jun2019,5
33,"I've been off my medication (zyprexa, fully supported by my psych) for about a month or two. I feel great, I lost a LOT of weight. I'm eating right and taking steps to move onto a career. 

Heres the rub, my moms mental health has been taking turns for the worst and its affecting me. She gets so angry over such trivial things. It's always been this way. My dad has noticed and I have definitely noticed. I spent much of my vacation this week in a fog of stress becuse she was so mean to me even in public places. Like getting aggressive with me at the supermarket in front of people when I didnt do the exact right thing or asked a ""stressful question"". I literally never get into arguments with anyone else but her. I know I'm being abused but I keep having the double think and I'm thinking about her behavior in psych terms (my major in which I graduated with honors).

I keep losing my chill over texts talking aboutb philosophical/intellectual stuff with certain people or complaining about my life situation to my brother. 
I'm having a lot of trouble maintaining a good attitude because I get yelled at for things like 20 times per day then she just goes back to normal like a light switch. 

I'm afraid of backsliding becuse I have this stalkholm syndrome thing where I make these neurological excuses for her behavior and shit but I feel like I'm straight up losing my humanity doing it.  

It's not fair that a very attractive 24 year old with a really good head on his shoulders feels like he is a peice of shit unworthy of love and afraid to even approach women or try to better his position in life. 

I dont think its fair that I had to be medicated when the real disease was a different person in my house as well as other bullies and aggressors that shamed and belittled me at any chance they could. 

The worst part about this is that part of me is grateful for being abused becuse I rationalize it by saying I'm a good psych student for it.  I shouldn't think that way. 

The real rub is that she is in al Anon and she literally acts like a terrible alcoholic while my dad is so sweet to me and never yells at me when I dont get the precise words or actions I do correct. He understands when my amygdala is overloaded and I forget stuff or I can't pay attention or make mistakes at work becuse my brain goes into its dissociative zone.  

Its not fair that I meditate, graduate college (the only one in my immediate family to do so), and go to the gym every day and become REALLY jacked. But i have the confidence level of a young teenager. 

It's not fair. It really isn't.",30Jun2019,2
34,"I have no more options. My parents don't understand mental health and even though I show all the signs of depression, they claim I'm faking it and refuse to take me to a psychologist. I've attempted suicide 2 times and they screamed at me to stop doing stupid things and basically destroy my social life as a ""solution"". I self harm and they get mad because I'm ""ruining their image"". I come to them with my problems and they blow it off saying I have none just because I'm a teen. They say I don't have depression and can't because I'm not supporting the family. They say I don't know what stress is and I shouldn't because I'm a teen. They don't believe I have the problems I know I do and I've run out of options.",30Jun2019,1
35,"As the title says, I'm 7 months pregnant and fucking terrified. The man I met is very neurotic, on top of his shit, and generally a perfectionist. The husband I have now takes ""naps"" that last for sometimes 4 consecutive days, with a few hours inbetween to send a few important emails for work (since he somehow always manages to get out of actually going to work), eat, and piss and shit. On his few best days, he will take a nao for at least an hour and be asleep by 7pm.

When he pulls himself together to spend a few hours together with me and family, he often slurrs his speech, stops talking in the middle of his already hard to follow sentences, and retains maybe 1/5 things he hears in conversations. Sometimes I can tell, even when standing up, he's about to fall asleep. When he wants to do me little favors (which are huge now) like coming along to the grocery store with me, he's barely there and I know he can't wait to go home and sleep. He asks questions and makes statement that makes anyone realize he's been absent the whole time and just wants to appear as if he'd been listening.

He's had days like that maybe once or twice a year and I just wrote them off as him being tired or overworked. For about a month now, it's been almost every day and I'm thankful for every lucid moment I have with him. 

I've been alone in this and despite me confronting him he's insisted nothing is wrong. For what feels like forever, i've felt crazy and neurotic for even being worried. After today I'm finally not alone anymore. My mother in law who visited, pulled me aside and asked me if he was drunk. Finally! I assured her, no, as only I'm aware he has been sober for a year. His issues with alcohol are genetic. His grandfather was an alcoholic and his father addicted to heroin. Before quitting, my sweet husband wouldn't necessarily drink too much, it just made him mean. 

Tonight I talked to him, cried to him, held him, and implored him to just tell me anything. I promised I would still love him and trust him even if he admitted to having lied before. No dice. Being next to him I believed him but talking to our friends (contacted by MIL) and even rereading my own post now, I know anything but drugs is highly unlikely. He gets a small prescription of xanax about once a year to take for long plane rides. He told me I could throw them out if I was so worried. He's agreed to take a drug test and even make an appointment with his doctor, which I can join. 

He's so excited for our baby and we tried so long after losing our first one. I told him I would leave and he couldn't be a father unless he fixed himself. Really I have nowhere to go. Ha! Even if I didn't love him, I think I'm stuck and I have to accept his word of ""everything will be back to normal by tomorrow"". Meanwhile I also know I can't allow my child to grow up under such circumstances. 

Anyways thanks for reading my long and messy post.  I don't know what I want from posting this or even whether I'm hoping for him to have lied about an addiction or genuinely have some other illness. In case your Aunt Margaret had the same problem but ended up just being vitamin B deficient, go ahead and please enable my wishful thinking.",30Jun2019,7
36,"I know I'm a teen, and it may just be my emotions messing with me, but I can't think of anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

For about a year now, I feel like... I dunno, sad is a simple term. I feel like I always have to be happy. In my friend group I feel like I have to laugh and smile for their sake. I do have fun and genuinely laugh, but once it's over I feel hollow. Like I have no energy, and when I'm home I isolate myself. I don't want to tell my family, and I want to wait until I'm out of the house to seek therapy. I've already gone to a therapist, and they said I'm fine. But I'm not fine! I feel like crying at the smallest slip-up, and my parents keep telling me it's the medicine I'm on. That it's not real. That I shouldn't feel this way. But it feels so real, and it hurts so bad! I think about suicide a lot, and I've been close to doing it. I'm home alone a lot, and I'm scared of myself. 

Please, if anyone has advice, please tell me. I'm scared.",30Jun2019,2
37,"I’m a student who’s going to college and I’ve always noticed that I’ve always been behind in school and it’s not because I’m dumb or I don’t try to study.

38,"For a few years now, probably longer, I've had fairly common minor auditory/visual hallucinations. Nothing too severe or debilitating or anything like that, very mild, but I've heard it can be a sign of a larger problem. Like I said, nothing big, but...enough to be a little annoying/concerning. For example, about two weeks ago I kept seeing movement/people shaped shadows just out of the corner of my eye. I'd look, and then they would disappear. I would also see movement in reflections off of things, and I'd be staring right at them. Nothing in the room was moving, to my knowledge. It was kind of freaking me out, because it took me a minute to realize there wasn't actually anyone/anything there and that'll still tend to weird you out a little anyway. For another example, I sometimes hear my name being called and can't find anyone who called it. Usually, there are people around, but no one said my name. Just yesterday, I was standing on the outskirts of a crowd waiting for something and I heard what sounded like someone behind me whispering my name in my ear. I turn around, and there's not anyone near me, not near enough to sound like they were whispering up close.

About the seeing things out of the corner of my eye, I've done that for a very long time. Even in broad daylight, I would look and see a shadowy figure just standing there right on the edges of my vision, walking by or looking at me. Again, I would look and they would be gone. I don't have any eye conditions or anything like that either.

I've heard people say that it's fairly normal, and I've heard other people say that it's possibly a sign of a larger problem. So I thought this would be a good place to ask - which is it?",30Jun2019,7
39,"My husband of six years has always had anxiety/depression and  anger issues. This past year has been particularly rough, he started a new career, moved away from his closest friends, and we have struggled more financially.

He doesn’t want to get put on meds and doesn’t thing counseling can actually fix anything. He’s had more suicidal thoughts  recently and I’m glad he’s sharing them with me but I don’t know how to help him.

40,"Hi everyone,  


I am a person living with bipolar, borderline, OCD, ADHD, and alcohol/cocaine addiction. I have struggled intensely for many years. Through strenuous effort and with the right treatment I have reigned in BPD, achieved abstinence from booze and drugs, and bipolar and OCD are in remission. I am doing better than I ever have.  


Currently I work in the mental health field as a Peer Support Specialist and I absolutely LOVE the work. I wake up every day excited to do it. I have so much talent also; I am very good at it. I eat, sleep, and breathe mental health recovery, and have made it my life's work to pass that recovery on to others. I believe so strongly in public service and the recovery model. I want to make a maximum positive impact on my community. After years of struggling with mental health and searching for my talents and passions, it feels like I've finally arrived.   


Here's the thing though: I come from an upper middle class family that puts high value on academic success and professional careers. My dad is a senior/lead engineer and makes 10k per month after taxes. My extended family is much the same. All upper middle class professionals. Engineers, lawyers, etc. Growing up I had this expectation of myself that I would be as well. I feel so inferior that I haven't been able to be that person. The values instilled in me tell me I have to have that brand new BMW, that nice house, tile floors, etc. It's hard to be grateful for what I have.   


I was an accounting major briefly for this reason. I am a very bright student. I get A's no problem, but due to mood cycling, addiction, and rapidly changing interests, it was difficult to stay focused and engaged. Accounting went well. Straight A's for a year of classes. I took to it right away. Here's the thing though, I don't want to be an accountant. Accountants often work 60-70 hours per week in high stress, high pressure environments. That would be very difficult for me to do, and even if I could do it, I flat out don't want to. For me, 70k per year (average accountant salary) is not worth that much of my time and that much stress. But again, a part of me tells me I \*should\*. An accounting career is my path to that middle class life I believe I should have.   


My passion lies in what I'm doing. I love every moment of it. I really feel like I have this opportunity to do something I'm truly passionate about, and that is a gift. And it's not like my taste is extravagant anyway. I am totally comfortable with a minimalist lifestyle. I don't give a s\*\*\* about having the ""best"" of anything.   


I don't know. Sorry if this sounds stupid. Could use some perspective. Or maybe I just wanted to vent.",30Jun2019,2
41,"I'm typing this with the intent of never sending it. I've contemplated this over and over and over, so I've set my timer on. None of this is justifiable--at least not to you. I'm respecting your boundaries right now and trying my best to not go off like a bomb, so I am verbally vomiting everything that I can't solve into this container built of 1s and 0s. 

I didn't end us well; I'm so fully aware of how I ended us that my awareness terrifies me. I disrespected your personal boundaries in an invasive way, and I don't know why or maybe I do? Part of me believes that any answer that I apply towards my improper actions is by default invalid, but I know I lashed out the way I did because I needed you desperately to take back your diagnosis. Any possibility of losing my mind--I couldn't accept. If someone saw me in a manner that I couldn't see myself, then we could conclude that I had indeed lost my mind; of course, that's only if they saw me accurately, but the possibility...that terrified me. Right now, I neither accept my perception of myself nor anyone else's perception of me--that's what defining  someone's mentality (even the slightest bit) for them does. I felt so ashamed and terrified of myself, but it's taking me time to know who I am-- like in graph theory where all paths could lead to the only state existing, which could be the ""self"". I don't want to live in this for the rest of my time, so I've decided not to. I know that I am what I decide to be (to an extent). 

I won't deny that good things came from knowing you. When I met you, I was steady and articulate and opinionated and outspoken and stubborn--still am, but I definitely filled in the blanks for what I wanted you to be. I was happy, which was something that I was trying to configure at the time. I felt like I had found another puzzle piece that I didn't need to jam together. It made sense...but I really didn't like you in the beginning--I saw too much of myself and my past that it seemed so familiar. The whole life is complex and let us open our minds to new dimensions was something that I had explored enough. But me being me, I let potential grow. I'm thankful that I chose to meet you for coffee because you were a lesson. I don't get to keep every beautiful thing that comes into my life, and even if it seems that I've solved my proof, there's another complexity waiting to be seen. I'm sorry for hurting you the way that I did. I apologize for that an uncountable yet countable amount of times.

Sometimes I hope that time will cross our lives again--where you and I have configured ourselves better. I don't know if the amount of hurt that you and I harbor would allow that. I don't know if I honestly want that after seeing such a different side of you, but right now, I think it's expected for me to hope for such a possibility. 

I could suppose that there exists the possibility where such an event occurs, but that proof doesn't belong to me. Therefore, any possibility of such an event can't and should not exist in my mind. Solution found ... Q.E.D.",30Jun2019,0
42,"I have 0 diagnosis, I have had 0 prescription that feel like they work, everything in my head is a negative angry depression soup. I don't even know if I want help anymore at this point. I don't think I can be helped. I think we have tried everything at this point. I can't get narcotics (Xanax Ativan Klonopin etc) as a prescription because I used to abuse them. I can't forgive myself for the way I treated my family during those years but after I sobered up it has been a constant uphill battle. I'm losing ground faster than ever since starting treatment (post drug use) and I don't know how to get back in the motions. how do I pull myself out of this depression tornado? I go to school to try and feel like I have a future. I try to work but I can't do it. I can't deal with stressed out yelling morons all day for 9 hours 6 days a week. I literally can't fucking handle it. I have fantasized about fighting every one of my co-workers and bosses and I've only been working there 20 days. I get so angry so quickly that I don't even realize it happening. until I'm screaming in somebody's face or beating myself in the face repeatedly or breaking something on the ground or anything.

44,"I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression last year. I started taking medication and seeing a therapist regularly. I have been working on myself and have gotten to a point where I know how to identify my triggers and developed good coping techniques. I was in a relationship last year and a huge fight with my ex-bf led to me feeling suicidal which made me realize I needed help. My relationship was never the same after that even though we were together till feb 2019. My ex never understood how anxiety and depression affected me and sometimes my reactions to things. When I was in the process of getting help, starting medication and therapy he was with me but wouldn’t cut me some slack, be  understanding of my mood swings or have my back in anyway. I know he didn’t sign up for that but is it unreasonable to expect your SO to just be more understanding and supportive while getting help? I didn’t do anything to break his trust or anything harmful. I would just be more moody than normal, feel hurt irrationally or more than normal and sometimes need to talk to him a lot more. 
Even a few months after this when I expressed my pain and struggles his constant response was ‘you have a great life and shouldn’t feel this way’, which in turn made me feel worse as I was already feeling guilty for feeling sad and depressed (even though I knew its a disease and not my fault). My feelings didn’t make sense to him as it wasn’t logical. He never truly understood depression is an illness and sometimes I can’t control my feelings. He constantly made me feel like I’m choosing to feel the way I do and guilty for asking for help. We eventually broke up as he felt he couldn’t meet my needs and he wasn’t ready to be with me anymore. 
 I’m glad we broke up and am happier not having an unavailable and judgmental boyfriend. I know he was a selfish jerk cause of the roles were reversed I would have been supportive every step of the way.

Aside from this, if I do get a dream in my non-disrupted sleep it's usually a nightmare of the exact same thing. I'm getting used to the nightmares now, i've had them since the start of this year, so that's almost 7 months.

The reason i'm mentioning my sleep paralysis is that sometimes when i'm awake, i'll hallucinate and I can't move. It's exactly like sleep paralysis but i'm already awake. Anxiety begins to follow as I know this shouldn't be happening. Maybe i'm frozen from fear? Why am I hallucinating then? I don't know.

Recently now, my anxiety has escalated, i'm having panic attacks almost every week. I excuse myself so that my parents or siblings don't get to see them. I usually pace back and forth, count to ten with my fingers, and repeat. I talk to my friends about my issues sometimes, but I don't want to overload them when they already have so much going on in their lives.

My parents booked a doctors appointment a few months back. When I went they did the most obvious and lazy thing ever, pinned it on my autism diagnosis. No, this shouldn't be happening despite whatever symptom autism gives people. I should not be seeing my friends and family die every night, I should not be paralysed suddenly and start hallucinating mid-day, I should not have a sudden spike in panic attacks for no reason. I was diagnosed 2 fucking years ago. None of this should be happening.

Do they not understand how hard it can be for some, just to get by every day, a majority bottle it up but when words are spilt people seem to sugar coat it and often it will make the person feel worse about it.

We need relation &amp; understanding. Not to be told everything will be fine. Especially from someone who is fine.

53,"I’m struggling a lot right now. My fiancé and I are fighting and we live together with my 3 year-old and our 1 month old baby. Things got really out of hand tonight, luckily my older child was at her father’s. He told me that he thinks I’m bipolar or have some sort of chemical imbalance. He’s not the first person to tell me this. My mom has told me she thinks I need to seek help for some sort of mental condition many times, as have other people in my life. I’m worried that if I do go to the doctor(which terrifies me already), that they will try to medicate me. Medication scares me. Most of my family has a history of addiction. I’ve also known a lot of people that medications seem to make worse when they do seek help. I’m scared and sad. How did you know you needed to seek help?",30Jun2019,2

56,"I've been with this girl for a while now. I really love her and want to help her. The problem is that she has depression and anxiety. She's taking pills to help that but they do not fix anything, only temporarily improve her mood. At the same time she also has ocd. To the point of where clothes hanging in the wardrobe are not touching. She sleeps from 3 am to 3pm nearly every day. She doesn't work, she's looking for a job. She doesn't have any hobbies that she actively does except playing games on her phone or checking her instagram. She doesn't eat regularly or well, at the same time she doesn't eat much. There is also some child trauma that she told me about where her mother told her when she was 14 how much she hates her and wished she was never born. My girlfriend also told me that she doesn't like hugs or cuddles, while at the same time her mother never really hugged her. Also she told me stories how when she went clubbing her mother wouldn't call or ask if she was ok or safe. Her father left her when she was 2, and would never call or visit. He got her birthday wrong this year aswell. Now my girlfriend is 19 , I'm 21 , she lives with her grandparents in my city. Is there anything I could do to help her? Thank you.",30Jun2019,2

61,"I tried several therapists and it didnt quite help me. Medication freaks me out - especially since the first one I tried sat very poorly with me and I'm worried about long term brain damage from antidepressants. I tried changing my behaviors to increase my sense of self-worth which is currently at rock bottom. I found that if I put maximum effort I could change my self maybe 1% when I'm still left with the 99% that makes me hate myself. I feel like I have failed life. I am bad with relationships and generally not a great person and have lost a lot of friends. I am not good at making new ones anymore. I have nothing to be proud of. I dont have any skills or talents of any sort. I feel ugly and I'm very socially anxious.

Everything positive that has come my way has genuinely been a sheer stroke of luck rather than my achievement. I am incredibly lucky to have a boyfriend that loves me more than anything. I was incredibly lucky to have had a job despite the environment being somewhat toxic (eventually causing me to resign and currently be jobless) and a supportive sister (despite the rest of my family being detached from me).

A lot of people look to me (therapists included) and say ""oh see, this is indicative of the fact that you have good qualities after all."" For instance, they would point to the fact that I wouldn't have had the job had I not done well in an interview or stood out. None of these things are true. I got lucky enough to score a referral from someone really high up in the company and the team she referred me to was desperate for people. They would have taken anyone. Or they would point to my boyfriend or my sister and their love for me. As for my boyfriend, he saw I was not doing so great and wanted to help me as a friend and ended up growing feelings for me along the way. He's just a very kind soul - volunteers at an animal shelter in his spare time etc. My sister loves me because we both grew up in a very conservative family that shamed me for having pre marital sex and hates gay people when my sister is secretly gay. As a result we are very good friends. She would never be my friend if we weren't related.

I feel like my sheer existence disgusts and offends most other people and the fact that I'm inconsiderate, distant and forgetful doesnt help the case. I have immense paranoia that I will also soil the few close relationships that I have.

As a result, not only am the most depressed I have ever been (I have contemplated suicide pretty often as of recently) but I just spend a lot of time fantasizing about redoing my life, and have hardly any hope in this one. The fantasy keeps me going but is also eating away at me. Being immersed in the fantasy is one of the few things that makes me really happy but at the same time, I have little motivation for reality to the point where getting out of bed to drink water is difficult let alone anything else. I cant really sleep because I'm up feeling miserable and when I do sleep, I oversleep and then dehydrate and starve myself by just laying in bed past noon. I feel like I will fail at everything I do whether it is all my job interviews (I have been consistently bombing since I resigned) relationships (like the friends I have also lost during this time frame) and worst of all that I will fail my boyfriend and my sister both of whom put so much effort into trying to help me.

I'm venting to reddit because I feel bad constantly bringing him and my sister down by telling them how depressed I am and because... I dont know... I'm hoping theres a magic solution or something that I'm overlooking. I am so desperate. I dont have much of a reason to stay alive other than my boyfriend and my sister and how much it would hurt them if I were dead. Also because if I wasnt so broken and lay comatose in bed a day, my life/environment is better than that of most of the world and it doesnt feel right throwing it away (considering I live in a first world country, am not diseased or impoverished etc). It's almost morning and I haven't slept all night and I have a career fair I'm supposed to attend soon that I've also sabotaged from insomnia.

TLDR: I keep failing and self sabotaging. I'm not a good person and have nothing to be proud of. I want to find the motivation to keep trying for the people that love and care about me but I seem to obsess about the fantasy of redoing my life instead because I feel so helpless in my current situation.",30Jun2019,0

69,"Today I've been a devastated panicky mess....the balloon just went POP!

A number of things have contributed to this:

1.My first proper boyfriend  moved to Norway (from the UK) After living in the UK for a year, he decided it wasnt for him. His brother lives there and he said I was the only thing keeping him in the country. We were madly in love with each other and still are \*vomit\*. We never had a single dispute in the 5 months we were together and we still talk everyday on the phone. I am also going to visit him in August.

2. We are both terrible at handling it - he feels horrific for leaving me and I thought it would be so much easier, than it has been, to move on - he's been away for 4 weeks now and states that he doesn't want to ""look back, only forward."" I want him to be happy because I care about him, but I also can't stand us being so far away from each other and how I may need to accept that one day we will have to go our seperate ways. I had SO MUCH bad luck with guys before him, which made him extra special to me. Consequently, I'm really insecure about being alone again.

3. He doesnt want a long distance relationship, even though we are basically in one and are likely to be in one till at least I visit him in August. 

4. We are going round in circles with A. Long distance isn't practical B. Maybe we should give each other space C.I miss him or he misses me and we call D. We call everyday E. It gets more difficult because we get really close but we dont have any phyical connection...then the cycle begins again.

5. Of course, I can't wait to see him in August but I'm petrifyed of what's going to happen afterwards. After spending a week with him we are going to become even closer, which is going to make it REALLY difficult for us to seperate again and I dont want to get hurt again.

6. My friends keep saying I should ditch him completely but he's done nothing wrong in my eyes and he clearly hates that I'm so lost right now. I feel like I talk to them about it becuase they don't get it. 

7. I am really behind on finishing my degree because my mental health has caused a delay in everything. I was meant to graduate in July but that's not going to happen, because I haven't finished my dissertation. On the up side, I have been given an extention on my deadlines to mid-august. Which means I will be able to graduate with a result I want in December. But I won't be abe to gradaute with my class.

8. All my friends are graduating in July and I wont be...  I'm not going to able to celebrate with them

9. My Aunty and Grandad are convinced I don't care about my degree...even though I've literally pushed my mental health to the brink and was diagnosed with Epilepsy in my first year. They constently remind me about how much money it cost and how much it would be a waste if I failed. My parents are doing their best to shut them up, but I called my Aunty today, to ask about her holiday and the topic eventually came to me....THIS WAS THE TRIGGER FOR EVERYTHING TODAY

10. I am desperate to be a qualified social worker and to work witth young people in mental health - it's my dream, but I struggle to see how  sitting in lectures and writting assignments is going to help anyone, including myself. When I left school it was just expected that I was going straight to Uni. I even looked at apprentiships to see if there was one in Social Work but there wasn't at the time. However, I know that in MA Social Work there are more opportunities for placement and once I've finished I'll be able to get a job in something I actually want to do.

11. I owe my parents so much money! My Mum pesters me about it all the time even though I am fully aware of the situation. To help pay off my debts I eventually found a job for the summer, whilst I'm at home which I'm looking forwaed to starting. Ive just been to Poland and Denmark to see friends but my parents paid for almost all of that. And before that, I told them about my bf inviting me to Norway. My Mum wanted me to go but I had/still have no money so she offered to pay. I have to pay her back for that too. When I told my Aunty that I had a job this morning her opinion was that my degree came first and that habing a job isn't important.

12. I have polycystic Ovarian Syndrome which means I have irregular periods. However, I take a pill that regulates them to a fixed cycle. Although, this time I didn't have a period and started to panic that I could be pregnant because there had been enough time since I had last seen my bf. I told him and said I would go to the pharmacy as soon as I could. I ended up having to buy my first pregnancy test which was petrifying. I did it and luckily I'm not but I'm now unsure of what I'm going to do in the furture...how will I know if I am or If im not pregnant? ...Am I going to have to spend £20 each time I miss a period? 

12. I went to the pharmacy to see if I could get emergency medication today but because it's my new pharmacy they had to check my prescriptions from my old one. This prescription ended up being incorrectly recorded- saying that I have 25mmg a day, when I have been on 200mmg since I was 16. I was nearly in tears and couldnt help but panic that I was going to be in a worse state as time went on. I told them there was a mistake. Also, because it would be a ""new prescription"" I would need to pay for it, even though I have an NHS Medical Expemption card, which usually means that I get it for free. Long story short I had to pay £9 for 2X25mmg tablets that would not do much to help my current state, but I had no choice, but to take it otherwise, I would have been likely to spiral down further. 

I'm making an appointment with the Drs tomorrow and hopefully I can atleast get my prescription fixed.

I feel so lost and confused right now...idk what the right or wong thing to do is...I could really do with some guidance.",30Jun2019,1

When I think about my mental health journey the first thing I think about is the first time that someone spoke to me about needing professional help. They tried to reassure me that seeking help was a really normal thing to do and related it to having a broken bone and that people get broken bones fixed all the time. But now that I’ve been through the journey, I realised that it really isn’t like that at all. Bones are easily fixed, put a plaster on it and let it rest; the body does all the work. The process of recovering from a mental illness takes work and commitment. It takes courage and a whole lot of patience. It takes longer than fixing a broken bone. 

When I was 18, I found myself in a situation that is unfortunately all too common. I was in a physically and emotionaly abusive relationship. I was worn down to a shell. I was constantly made to feel worthless and powerless and a burden. This relationship lasted two years. Two years of feeling all of these things - I knew nothing else, I had accepted that life. I stopped knowing how to care for myself because all I knew were the rules that had been set for me. I didn’t know how to leave and I didn’t really want to. Some nights I would leave, I would stay in a hotel room and sit with my back to the door afraid he would find out where I was. I spent a lot of these nights not sleeping. I remember it being the middle of summer, in a tiny hotel room with the only light coming from the air conditioner that I had left on all day. But I felt nothing. I wasn’t hot. I wasn’t cold. I was just numb. I spent a lot of time staring at myself in the mirror, watching bruises forming around my neck and repeating the words “this is your fault”. But I knew nothing else, I always went back. That is, until the world shifted slightly and I decided I needed to go. It was both the hardest and best decision I ever made. I was out but I was broken. What came next was a very long process of figuring out what had happened to me. My abuser did a really good job of taking away my voice. I was afraid that people wouldn’t believe me and sometimes exactly that happened. I was 21, living in an entirely new town and the only people I knew and trusted didn’t mind when I decided not to be kind to myself. I was 21 and I was addicted to drugs.

Having unhealthy coping mechanisms was incredibly exhausting. Drugs were just the beginning of avoiding how I truly felt. It was the perfect mask. Needle goes in, self hate evaporates and I feel warm again. I was walking a fine line between throwing my life away and being a perfectly functioning adult. I was paying rent, working two jobs and socialising - I was functioning. Self harm was my way of being able to feel again. I was stuck in a cycle of trying to accept what happened to me wasn’t my fault and punishing myself for what happened to me. I refused to speak about it and I refused to believe I had a problem. Something had to give, and it did. I overdosed. I never really wanted to die but I definitely didn’t want to live either. I was 23 and I was in a hospital bed detoxing. It was November and almost my 24th birthday. No one knew where I was and I was too ashamed to tell anyone. I needed help but I didn’t know how to help myself and I certainly didn’t think I deserved it. I felt an overwhelming amount of shame. Every time someone noticed the track marks on my arm or the self harm scars, I would get a stab of shame in the pit of my stomach and I felt like I was on fire. But this time I noticed something different. There was finally light. It was small but it was there and that was all I needed - hope. I was clean and I was ready to deal with my mental health. 

It took me quite a long time to feel comfortable talking about myself. I was embarrassed and being honest to a complete stranger was terrifying. But the counsellor was patient. He let me change the subject over and over again. I relapsed a lot throughout this process. But I didn’t fail. I relapsed again and again but I never saw it as failing. Just part of my process. The more I opened up about what I had experienced the more I realised how unwell I had become. I was getting flashbacks multiple times a day, I wasn’t sleeping and I couldn’t focus on anything. I didn’t want to take care of myself anymore. The counsellor noticed these signs before I could and made a referral to someone who specialises in trauma. I saw this as him giving up on me. I spiralled and I lost control again. Eventually I reached out to the service I was referred to. I didn’t meet their criteria and was refused counselling. At this point I knew I wasn’t doing well. Addiction was hiding close by in the shadows and I was still using everyday. I kept searching. I found a program really close to where I was living. I was accepted and put on a waiting list. I waited for 3 months. I was in limbo. The first session was with a trauma specialist. I didn’t feel comfortable. I didn’t like her approach. I felt invalidated and I felt small and fragile. I left the session asking myself if what I had experienced was really that bad at all, had I just overreacted? Why was this still affecting me? all these years later. This is when I learnt the valuable lesson of one counsellor doesn’t fit all. Keep trying. Keep searching. Keep allowing yourself to get the help you deserve because I did deserve it and I still deserve it now, today. 

It took me many years of being incredibly unkind to myself to learn the importance of self care. Being kind to myself gives me the mental clarity to be kind to other people. Take a warm bath with candles, watch your favourite movie with your favourite person with your favourite food. Enjoy food for what it is without counting calories and feeling guilty. Go for a walk and stand on all the crunchy leaves. Caring for yourself can sometimes be the hardest part of the day but if you’re empty then so is everything you do. Fill your cup first. 

I turn 28 in a couple of months. 10 years on and I’m still in counselling. I’m still allowing myself to heal and I’m giving myself as much time as I need. Because healing invisible wounds takes longer. If there’s anything I have learnt from everything I have experienced it would be to remind myself that I deserve happiness. It’s not being ashamed of having scars and covering those scars with tattoos doesn’t take them away. It’s catching myself before I fall because I definitely still fall sometimes. It’s letting myself feel everything I need to feel and understanding why. It’s being proud of myself and being proud of what I have accomplished. It’s coexisting with myself and being comfortable. 

Recovery is a word that means something different to everyone, today it might mean that you got out of bed and you washed your hair and you let the warmth of the sun hit your face and you were able to smile and laugh. Tomorrow it might mean staying in bed and letting yourself recharge. But every inhale and every exhale means you’re still trying and that’s what recovery is all about - not giving up.",30Jun2019,3

72,"Hi y'all, first-time poster I think. I don't remember if I've shared my art on here before or not. But I'd like to share my story about my worst bout of depression that I've ever faced. I've had depression since I was 14 and I'm 18 now, so it's been a hard few years. I'd never experienced something this terrible until this story I'm about to tell you.

**October 2018**

I had just begun my senior year of high school, and things were looking average for me. I wasn't necessarily excited about graduating, but I wasn't upset about it either. I had been promoted to the head of marketing for my student government (SG), had three AP courses, my art career was beginning to soar in terms of popularity and quality, I'd been accepted to the University of Iowa and my friend-count was bigger than it'd ever been. Everything was super smooth! I felt great leading up to October.
But then it started again - depression, that damned gnat that gnawed at my mind all the time. What started out as a simple episode of being under the weather mentally turned into suicidal ideation, hopelessness and decreased interest in literally everything. I like to blame Albert Camus' *The Stranger* for this episode because I was reading it for AP Literature, and the entire 'life is meaningless' thing was kind of resonating with me. But in reality, it was just the stress catching up to me I think. 

I did my best to keep moving and keep up with my responsibilities as a student, artist and an SG representative, but the days began to feel like weeks and there was a constant black cloud hovering over me. I became unapproachable and difficult to work with, according to my best friend who was also in SG. It was like, one minute I'd be the regular ol' OlePope and then the next I'd become some kind of negative creep. Being told I was being an awful person really sank me deeper into the slime of mental illness, and it got worse. I refused to show up for anything that didn't directly interest me, do any work in class, and often turned in SG advertisements days before the actual events. The 'progress' I believed I was making was not progress at all.

During this time, I was often found making art with music blaring and I did my best to keep myself calm while in my mind I was begging the universe to throw me a bone. With every drawing I made, it looked terrible to my sinking mind and the woeful tunes from bands like Linkin Park and Death Cab for Cutie in the background, my art of that time was an unsheathing of all of my failings as an insecure silly boy in that dry October month. I had ruined friendships, made people mad that I never wanted to make mad, and let myself down as a result. I often thought I had the answers, and I thought I had this entire life thing by the throat. Obviously, this wasn’t true.

 I couldn’t sleep well at night, I felt hopeless and I had no patience left with anything or anybody around me. Ironically, I was in denial that it was happening. Depression certainly couldn’t be THAT rough on me, could it? It couldn’t turn me into an unapproachable shell of myself, make me look down at the darkness below and recognize it’s existence. It never made me feel this way. It couldn’t because I was better than that. Unfortunately, as many of you know, depression can be as bad as it wants to be at any time. I had my first ever major episode that made me believe that one of these days I was going to gather the guts to kill myself, and I didn’t care how it would affect anyone or the timeline of events from then to now. 

**June 2019**

Thankfully, I never attempted to take my own life. I chose to ride it out like always, no matter how hard it was or how bad I wanted to overdose on my own medication. Now, I’ve graduated from high school and I like to think my entire life has flipped. There are still days where I don’t want to do anything, of course, but for the most part, I will get out of bed and do my best to do anything, no matter how small or big. 

I’ve been enrolled in the University of Iowa for a few months now, and it’s almost unreal to me that I would have made it this far when just a mere eight months ago I was considering killing myself because there was no balance in the chaos. But despite it all, I made it, and I’m still me. I want to know my fate for the first time in years. 

I've been to the bottom, and I don't doubt that I'll be back there again eventually. This period of misery helped me understand that I didn't want to be known as a depressed friend. Iowa became my ticket to prove people wrong, to prove myself wrong. I can do this! This entire world is mine for the taking, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop destiny. 

October 2018, how I do not miss you.

Stay strong everyone, it does get better. Truly.

73,"I'm a procrastinator since early teens but only recently things really have hit the bottom. For over two years I aim enrolling in an university (I'm 20) but simply can't make myself do the study for the entrance exam. In fact, in my desk I have a chemistry book on the exact same page it had in the beginning of this period. 

I've tried everything guys, meditation, exercise, nutritous food, motivational books and videos, depriving myself of things (including my phone), psychological appointments etc., but nothing works. In the end I just walk around the house talking to myself or stay in the bed sleeping all day. 

The cause for all this you may ask? It all comes down to sadness and habit I think. For pretty much all my life I've been lonely, had an absolutely awful and unmotivating school and lived in a place with almost no nature. Recently I got a movement disorder that's greatly impacting my life and that just worsens everything. 

I'm desperate at this point because regardless of what happened to me in the past or is happening now, I have to act and do something with my life, but I don't know how to go about this.

74,"So I've been in love with this girl for about a year now but only recently had the courage to start talking to her. I guess I'm a bit overwhelmed and in over my head, because now that I started actually getting to know her I'm just becoming a complete mess;   


Since early June, I haven't had a good night's sleep consistently and generally lost my appetite. When I'm in school, I can hardly concentrate on anything because I'm always drifting off longing for her or worrying about what might happen. When I got free time, I can't be bothered to do anything anymore, instead I mostly lay down in bed and sleep. I kinda got out of touch with my friends, but although they were the best friends I had so far I feel like they kinda neglected me as a fifth wheel still.   


I'm not quite sure what to do, because at the moment I don't really have anyone to talk to. The closest person I'm still on good terms and in touch with is the girl herself, but I can't explain what's going on without confessing to her and she herself has a mental illness way more serious than my troubles so I don't feel like my emotions are valid enough to be pitiful compared to hers. Plus, she may not be the best counsellor even if I was able to talk to her given her own illness.",30Jun2019,1

76,"It’s been happening since I was a kid. When I was younger, as a pre-teen, I used to self harm. I failed an entire year because I just didn’t get out of bed. It got tk the point where we had to replace the mattress. My mom tried her best, but even when I did go to school I couldn’t distract myself. My only escape was the Internet. I was obese (30kg over the normal weight for my age at the time). I was kind of forced into moving into my dad, I said I wanted to, but I never really felt like it was something I wanted, perhaps just something I needed. I saw therapists after therapists, but nothing worked. They were three rough years. My depression was acknowledged, but my father was strongly against any medication. He put me in a gym, for kickbox and working out. It worked out for a while. I was brand new, had some self esteem, kind of got fooled into thinking I was mentally okay. A big part of what was causing my ill-being was indeed my weight, and I don’t judge my father for thinking I was cured out of any evils now. I just dealt with them differently. I had friends for what felt like the first time, in a long time. But that wasn’t enough. I never had the willpower to do anything. I never had the natural drive to get things done. I just sat on my chair every night, forced, looking at a book and feeling numb. This in turn got my dad 24/7 pissed, saying I was just lazy and couldn’t get anything done right. But the way he raised me was not correct. I admire his effort and I still love him. I was constantly grounded, stripped of anything to do in my spare time except studying. This was okay. Even though his punishments were harsh, I knew he had my best interest at heart. But the physical punishments started. I’m not going into much detail, but the last time, when I was 15, I was completely grounded and I got slapped multiple times, so hard I busted the back of my head open as it hit the wall, bleeding etc etc. But the physical pain I felt at the time was nothing compared to what was going through my head. This was it for me. I knew there was a line separating father love and care and abuse. I never did anything against him, I just moved back in with my mom. She’s the love of my life, has always been. The biggest emotional (and anything) support I have in my life. But this whole conflict with my dad sent me further down this hole. It’s really complicated, because I love him and all he’s done for me, but I absolutely fucking hate the fact that it was okay in his head to beat the shit out of me. Even when I was a little kid he hit me, just never as strong. The first term went alright, but then it went downhill. I started smoking weed, and I absolutely fell in love. I felt guilty because it was a drug and illegal, but that was the lesser evil, because I did it moderately. Until I didn’t, and now I’m high (almost) all the time. I can not be high. I’ve managed that, but reality feels like this boring absence of any positive emotion. I do a lot more drugs now, but any harder substances I take are in parties. Codeine, cocaine, LSD, MDMA. Fuck, I love\hate MDMA. I never felt so happy in my life, yet so miserable the days after. I’m 17 now. I’m an insecure mess ever since I moved back in here. I no longer have  “anything” (except my height, but I’m growing to accept that) that makes me insecure. Have this really bad anxiety too, and it doesn’t help. The only times I do not feel any of these things is when I intoxicate myself. I feel sad, and I hope that my future isn’t anywhere near what I’ve lived and am living.",30Jun2019,1

78,"Well hello first of all and thank you for reading this.
First of all,psychosis is a mental illness symptom which provides hallucinations,delusions,paranoia and many more.
Second of all,many people think and believe that having psychosis is a horrible thing which is true but thinking that all of us are capable of doing monstrous things is very wrong.
Third of all,about this matter of ""psychotic people doing dangerous things"",for the people that are believing all the movies that Hollywood made,sorry to bring to you,but psychotic people are not monsters.We do not kill people,beat them or do any kind of violence.
Fourth of all,the only persons that we sometimes hurt are us.Sometimes we are very harsh on ourselves,but with time passing we learn how to love ourselves more and more.
So this said please help people with psychotic symptoms/disorders and people with mental illnesses cause we want to be better tomorrow than today and we need help and encouragement.

81,"So I’ve never really been depressed, per say. But I’ve always just felt like I was marching through every day with no purpose. I had no plan or anything. Well a combination of a lot of things led me to taking college seriously and a big help was a TV show. 

So obviously everyone has series/shows that make them feel calm, or what they watch before bed. I was never  super into Anime when I was young and only just started Naruto. Just seeing all the characters in that show (good or bad) with such a drive to fulfill their purpose, is very refreshing to these relatable shows (Bojack Horseman, Office), which are by no means bad shows! That, and hearing Naruto and others constantly say that they will get better, and they will succeed. Hearing this repeated to me and seeing them follow through has been such a huge help, because I started saying it all ironically. Anyways, it’s a good/very dumb show that I love. Hope this resonates with others, I’d love to hear similar stories.",30Jun2019,1

My husband has changed my life for the better and he has had the patience of a saint. 

But every time something is going right, I fucking sabotage it.  I halt all progress, regress, and figuratively kill it... with fire. 

I’ve done this with so many areas of my life. Especially when trying to make and keep friends. Things will be damn near perfect and I will find some asinine reason to try and kill the friendship or push them away altogether. I tried to do this for YEARS to my now husband, and even called off our wedding TWICE. But he’s, thankfully, stubborn and loves me more than I deserve. 

I’ve also done this with weight loss - had managed to lose right at 100 pounds and was so close to a healthy, normal BMI - and sabotaged it with a 6 month long binge of the worst foods imaginable. Currently trying to just reach where I was before. 

I’ve done this with school as well - I earned my associates degree two years ago, but have balked at and stalled out on making any real progress towards my bachelors degree.

And then, there's me. It took me days to manage to get out of the house and drag myself to the pool. And now I realize. I see non-depressed adults the same way they see kids. How do they have so much energy to do activities all day, every day? And when they see how I live, they probably think ""Why does she do nothing? I'll never be like that it must be boring"".

87,"its been this same cycle for years and im tired of being so lonely all the time, ive been dealing with depression on and off since i was 13-14 (19 now), i always have pretty high anxiety but depression makes it a lot worse and makes me really paranoid.  

every time i get bad i completely isolate myself, i cut off communication with everyone, just stop replying to texts, which usually leads to an argument and then i stop talking to that person, and this happens with literally everyone and its been happening multiple times a year. i dont know why but i cant open up about mental health issues i just cant with anyone, theres not a single person i can talk to or have ever spoken to.  i lied about suicide attempts, i lie about how im doing, i lie to therapists and my parents, i have so many trust issues i just cant be open anywhere else but anonymously online. 

i think people just assume im an asshole who doesnt want to talk to anyone so they dont bother with me which really hurts but i dont know how else to behave, i dont know how else to deal with being miserable.  its really fucking with my life i keep quitting jobs, dropping out of highschool, then college, dropping co-ops, ive fucked up pretty much every opportunity ive had in the last few years, ruined all my references, everything     

  other than a couple months at college i havent had steady friends since i was 15 and i hate to admit it but its killing me.  i need to be with someone, i just want to be loved by literally anyone.  i look normal, im tall, fit, pretty good looking, i know i can get laid whenever i want, never had issues getting girls, i know i can make friends with anyone i want, my social skills are excellent, i always fit in wherever i went.  then i freak out the anxiety and paranoia takes over and i ruin all my work forming relationships in minutes, every fucking time. its like i have to get rid of everyone before they find out how much of a mess i am. 

 the only way ive been able to have decent relationships is online because i can duck out for a few months while stuff is bad and come back like nothing happened, just tell people i took a break. but the games arent fun anymore, online relationships dont give me any satisfaction anymore.  ive spent well over 15,000hrs playing games since i was 12.  ive spent years pretty much living online but i cant do it anymore, and for the first time in my life my anxiety is taking over online too.  now half the time i just sit in channels with my friends and dont talk or contribute anything, everyone jokes that im a mute now but just speaking is making me so damn uncomfortable now.  i usually just say its issues with my mic but idk if people actually buy it.",30Jun2019,1
88,"Hey everyone, just gonna drop this story as a rant/reminder to stay strong and do what's best for you, even if that means parting ways with a friend who was once close but then turned into a negative impact on your mental health. 

To keep things brief, I'll kind of shortly skim over some details in short note and then just describe the meat of the story. Also, all names are aliases and not their actual names, for the sake of anonymity. 

At the start of my uni degree I joined a group of people who liked video games, anime, dnd, and other internet culture stuff like me. Some of them became some really close friends, particularly one became, what I thought was, my best friend. Towards the end of our first year, the group had started a routine of playing dnd once a week or every second week. However, in our last year of uni most of us started missing more than we used to for work terms or studying more than usual for post-graduation ambitions. This meant that dnd was happening at most twice a month, but usually only once. Now, the friend that I thought was my best friend, Mark as I'll label him, became oddly negative towards me specifically because of my absents. Now, admittedly I was missing the most out of everyone, but everyone in the group knew that a) I was working hard to get into a competitive grad school and b) I was having an usually hard time with my mental health, to the point I dropped two courses in my first semester of my last year). Now, of all the people in the group, Mark knew in the most detail how much I struggle with my mental health and that when I'm not feeling well it is nearly impossible for me to force myself to do something. But, to my surprise, Mark wasn't the understanding and supportive friend I thought he was. Instead, he started getting upset with my absences and when I tried to explain how it wasn't as simple as just going he would just brush it off like my struggles didn't matter. Fast forward to the end of our school year, Mark started throwing some shade at my by talking about someone else he knew who was able to make time so, subsequently, I should have also been able to make time. This hurt, deeply, as it was coming from the person I thought was my best friend. Normally, he was all ears, would listen to my struggles, and be very supportive. But, instead, he was belittling my problems and so my mental health went into fight or flight mode: I fled. I practically went off the grid from our group chat and only talked to those who were understanding towards me and continued to be close with them. Eventually, I tried standing up to Mark. I told him that I wanted to understand why he was so frustrated with me and that I thought it was unfair how he was treating me. I also tried to, once again, explain kind of the mental breakdown of how my mind would kick in sometimes and prevent me from going more than normal after he started being mean towards me. I tried my best to be reasonable and I even took blame when I felt like the victim. He, however, blew up in my face about it. Told me about all his problems that he's never tried to talk about and that said that because he's so good at hiding them and not letting them control his life that I shouldn't either. He then went on to say that my 'attitude' was contributing to the negative stigma behind mental health because I used it as an excuse for being a 'bad friend'. I consulted three of my other friends in the group and told them to be as honest as possible about the entire situation (I read all of both my messages and Mark's to them) they all said Mark was being harsh and unfair. I was still a little hopeful, delusional, that he was still the best friend I once trusted so much. I told him that I was sorry that I upset him and went on a huge essay about all the things I did against my discomfort and mental health struggles to please him and our friendship, and he came back with simply saying that he hoped I got my shit together. I told him I was sorry I wasn't the kind of friend he needed and left it there. We haven't spoke for a very long time, I left the group, and keep in contact with only two or the members now. 

Don't EVER let someone tell you your mental health struggles are the reason there is a negative stigma around mental health. Try your best to surround yourself with friends who are understanding and supportive. Not everyone will be perfect, sometimes our friends will make mistakes and hurt us, but a good friend will talk that through and overcome trivial matters. A good friend won't attack you for your hardship. 

TLDR; if someone you consider a friend treats you unfairly for your mental health and even after confrontation they verbally assault you, don't stick around. You do not deserve to be treated unfairly, not one does. We all deserve to have people who understand us, and us understand them. But you can't understand someone who doesn't open up to you and subsequently attacks you for opening up to them. Stay strong friends &lt;3",30Jun2019,1
89,"Tl;DRR: I was told sex and women are forbidden and bad for me. Didn’t affect me until last few years and I’ve slowly stopped being able to even date. 

I grew up in a large religious family and I’ve got adhd. I’m 25 M.

I’ve always liked books and in my teens I found some “inappropriate” books. When my parents found me with them I was beat excessively. They increased their punishments whenever I did anything remotely stupid. 

My dad also called me gay all the time (?) and when I would be spacing out or making stupid mistakes beat me and say “why are you thinking of women” and “have you been watching porn all day” 

In 8th grade my mom got cancer and when I last saw her on her hospice bed she told me to “stay away from women” and “stop being a player”. 

All this didn’t really stop me from having a couple girlfriend and boyfriends but recently it’s been fucking with me. 

I haven’t been in a relationship in 5 years and the stuff my parents said has been giving me nightmares. 
I’ve talked to multiple therapists and they have said I need to look at people I want them to look at me, or that life has its ups and downs, or that I need to return to church.

91,"Hi! I really need help, so if you have some time to read this I would be really greatful. 

So: I've finally decided to see a therapist this year. I really liked my first one, had a really great first session but my appointments were always being canceled and in the one I could actually schedule, she was almost 2h late. Everything was too complicated so I've decided to look for another one.

Eventually I started going to another therapist, she's completely different. She went really deep on my thoughts, my childhood, relationships, everything. And she wants me to start EMDR, the therapy she uses. The thing is, from what I've read, EMDR is mostly used with traumas, and I don't feel like I have any trauma at all. I've been feeling depressed, anxious, I feel numb most of the times, there's nothing that makes me happy anymore and it's really affecting my work life and my relationships. 

When I asked her why I should start this therapy, she said that EMDR sees every unpleasant events in my life as traumas. So she's digging really deep into my childhood to try and start EMDR with that.

I haven't started EMDR yet, I've been going to these appointments for two months now and I'm hating every single one.

In the last session she said that I'm not making any effort to get better, even though I'm going there every week. She's working all these old memories and there's stuff I can't remember, even if I keep trying.

I'm worried about the present and how I feel right now and she's bringing all this stuff from 20 years ago. I don't feel comfortable or any empathy at all around her. Right now I don't know if I should try and start EMDR (since it's a really complex and heavy therapy) or if I should try looking for a different therapist again.

I used to work an office job, that included a mixture of interacting with others and doing my own thing. My shifts were the typical 8 hours. Due to a dip in my mental health, I am no longer at that job.

Now, I am working in the service industry part time. I am on my feet and interacting with customers 99% of my shift. The thing is that the shifts range from 4-6 hours. 

Lately I’m finding that at the end of a 6 hour shift, I am mentally drained. Even if there is nothing bad in particular that has happened.. I will go home and just cry. I’m trying to figure out why? Is it the fact that I’m on my feet? Is it having that fake customer service voice for 6 hours.. is it the empath in me?

Soon after, I met another woman and we've been together for almost 2 years. I love her and she loves me, she makes me happy and cares for me in a way that none other has. I'm grateful to her.

My ex recently messaged me and we started taking, nothing flirty, but just talked about the past. I've had feelings of regret and shame for what I did and now it's back in full force.

97,"Hi. First time here, sorry if this is the wrong r/. I'll try to keep this short.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm 35, f, have an amazing BF (almost a year, a good, stable relationship with its normal ups and downs, but we're very happy), son (7-y-o, starts school this fall, amazing dude, 50 % parenting with a good relationship to the dad), a job (8-16, fulfilling, nice pay, good future ahead, liked at the workplace). 

Mental history: BPD which is mostly in control, and when not, I don't lash out, but turn inward, hence the problems I'm about to write down here. Also, my BF knows my symptoms, isn't burdened and I use a lot of time and care to keep our relationship healthy. Severe to mild depression with no real outbreaks after 11/2017, when I got my job, not counting an almost burn out because I took another job 5-12/2018 (but luckily got the good one back). Some anxiety issues(mostly under control) and two burn outs (due to unemployment, depression, etc.). No meds since 4/2016. BMI34, so yeah, weight is an issue, though it has been stable for years.

&amp;#x200B;

So, there's a lot in my life that's actually pretty good, but also many burdens. I'm restarting therapy in the fall, after a bit over two years. With all this, my life still feels empty. I don't have things that make me feel fulfilled as a person. Yes, my job does that when there, but that's only one part of my life. My lovelife is great and my son is great, but I don't have anything that is just and only mine. I don't have hobbies. I have tried many (theater as a produced, I drew until I was 20, I knit lace and crochet sometimes these days, etc.), but they don't stick properly. I mostly just watch series and sit around by myself. Making a cup of tea is too much sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Social media influences my agony with this as I see people doing things with passion. Anything you can imagine. And I don't mean I crave those likes and people fawning, I crave the feeling of liking something and getting a good feeling from doing it. When I finish a scarf, I don't get a feeling of accomplishment, I get a feeling of ""meh, ok, what's next?"". I can't make myself start anything, as everything feels like it won't mean anything in the end. Theater gave me a purpose, but it was superficial, just validation from others. I want to draw, I want to job, go to the gym, make puzzles, play games like I used to (loved Final Fantasies and Zeldas, etc.), go out to see museums and interesting events and concerts, and so on... But they all feel like a waste of time, even though I know they are not. I try things, like gym, and feel great after, but nothing sticks, I just don't go again.

98,"Sometimes whenever I'm doing something like reading or eating something, this indescribable feeling washes over me. And I mean every part of me. I feel terrible and just weird i can't explain. I want to disappear and i feel something close to nostalgia remembering a week ago and me telling myself ""it shouldn't be like that"", or "" i don't want that"" mentally. I want peace for once, i don't want to exist, (i literally want nothing) that time shouldn't be happening now because that was another day. It gives me the urge to do anything to not exist, and want to vanish and leave my life because it isn't what I wanted or sticks with me. 

It makes me think ""why am i doing this and what the hell is the purpose"" and makes me exhausted with what I'm currently doing it could be anything. I want to shut down.
It stops maybe after 30 seconds and i don't have it until a few days or week. But i dread it and hate it  and don't know what it is.",30Jun2019,1
99,"I have been feeling extremely unusual lately. As someone that struggles with anxiety and depression normally, I can't remember the last time I had the energy to see something through that wasn't for school. I am almost always constantly in a state of self doubt, which manifests itself in different ways. 

I had an intense episode around two weeks ago when I was alone overnight for the first time in months (I live with my boyfriend). My anxiety makes me super anxious when I am home alone for a period longer than a few days and my boyfriend had to go out of town for ten days. I was at home dogsitting our pup.  Sometime around him leaving, I started to get irritable for no reason and ""disappear"". It would feel like I would slip into being another person who was apathetic and distant every few hours. I would snap at him for no reason, and get pleasure from being cruel. I was horrified with my behavior but it didn't feel possible to stop. He would have to snap me out of it somehow. Three or so days before my boyfriend returned, I got sick with the worst flu of my life where I felt like I could barely move. This threw me into a panic because I was alone and could hardly eat, and felt extremely ill (Also I have a phobia of vomiting which can cause panic attacks because apparently I can't get a break lol). I felt like I couldn't breathe well or move and I felt feverish. It is hard to remember now, but the point is, I called 911 and they took me away in an ambulance. Yikesss. I woke up confused and kinda hazy and curious about how I got home. 

 When my boyfriend came home after the ten days, these anxious and apathetic fluctuations lasted for another couple days, and then the constant anxiety and waves of apathy gradually decreased. 

Things felt like they might be going back to my normal state of anxiousness. 

A few days ago, I started to lose my marbles for some reason. But this time it is different.
I have energy ALL THE TIME. I have ideas constantly and I suddenly have confidence to feel like I can finish projects, because I feel like the end project will be exciting and worth it. I am getting more into screenwriting, drawing, idea creating. I feel useful and productive for the first time outside of being in college. I don't even want to sleep, I am so excited about my ideas and writing them down. Hell, I made two powerpoint presentations for my boyfriend over the duration of several hours that were proposing new living room furniture. Why?? Who does that? Who has the time? Who has the energy?

However, I googled how I feel and it turns out it's hypomania. Apparently it feels great, but then gives way to either full on mania which doesn't feel good, or a depressive episode, which is... depressing. 

Sorry this was so long, I just really wanted to give context and ask what I should do in response to this hypomania and potential possibility of a mania or depressive episode.",30Jun2019,1
100,"I've thought about it for a while. Talking to a professional about myself and my problems that is. I've never talked to someone before but I feel like it's time that I do. My life's been sort of a downward spiral over the past 2 years and I'm really tired of feeling the way I do. 

Mainly I'm making this post to ask y'all if it'd worth talking to someone and if it really helps. Whether it's a psychologist, therapist or anything else that may help. I just want to stop feeling the way I do",30Jun2019,3

103,"I’m having trouble distinguishing between whether this feeling is due to chemical imbalances or just because I don’t want to live anymore. 

I won’t tell you my whole life story, however, I’ll tell you pieces. I raised by a single loving mother. I was sexually abused multiple times by the people closest to me (once by her closet friends son, but she doesn’t know. After all that she has done for me I can’t tell her that her best friend’s son did that to me) , bullied during school, and bullied after school. Then mentally and emotionally abused by my father, I was stupid, I’ll never amount to anything, I was never good enough. I was being groomed to follow the ‘the path he laid for me’. During college went great for a year and a half, then my depression worsened. Currently, I don’t see a future for myself. Where I once had this drive, motivation and dream to change the world it’s now nothing but despair. I don’t want to feel this way. Having thoughts of suicide is a daily occurrence for me and there are times I actually get excited to die where there’s no more pain. I have no interest in friends, I’m asexual, I’m kind to everyone I meet, the passion and joy I once had for Computer science vanished, I have no idea what to do. 

I really need help getting my life back. Please any advice extremely appreciated.",30Jun2019,3

105,"Hi. I've never been diagnosed nor went to a psychologist in my life but I feel like I should. Some days I just feel doing nothing at all, lazy, and all I want to do is grab a beer and watch a movie but I don't like alcohol. I drink like an Englishman, which is roughly one drink (beer/wine) per day. I can go for months without drinking. But on these particular days I just want to drink myself to sleep and do nothing. I'm a very productive person so this is really bothering me. I have never drank myself to sleep but I feel an urge to do so for absolutely no reason.

110,"I finally started seeing a therapist after years and years of struggling with anxiety and depression. I feel very invested in this. My therapist incorporates attachment theory in her work, which means she has been asking me a lot about my relationship to my family members. She brought my attention to a lot of things my father has said and done that are just plain wrong. I have always known him to be a very strict person, cruel at times in his judgment of people and situations. However I had never gained awareness on how much pain and problems his attitude has caused me, my sister and my mother. Going to therapy has made me develop that awareness. And now I just can’t deal with him. I can’t engage in a conversation with him or even look at him. I feel this is wrong and I’m confused.",30Jun2019,1

112,"Hello friends, i just wanted to share about how the gym is important to my health. For a while i was truly depressed everyday. I realized that my time was occupied correctly. I started filling up that time with forcing myself to go to the gym. And after 2 weeks straight of using so much energy to get there, my body started crazing it. 

Now the gym is a part of my daily habits and has changed my life completely.

113,"I am a teenager, I was bullied when I was younger and that messed me up when I was entering puberty, even though the bullying stopped at that point. I had horrible thoughts that I don’t want to dig up. I never told anyone but my best friend who couldn’t do anything about it. I had little will to keep going and the only thing keeping me up was the knowledge that others would miss me and that they were counting on me to do good in life. I didn’t get any help, and eventually got control of my thoughts. They creep into my mind sometimes but I push them away. 

I feel fine mentally now, but I am wondering if I should tell someone. It is hard for me to think about that time of darkness and I get really scared about those thoughts I had. Are mental health issues that have gone worth digging up? Or should they be forgotten?",30Jun2019,1

115,"I've been debating for a bit now whether to go inpatient for my anxiety and depression. I feel like I'm just getting worse and worse. I feel like I'm having trouble coping with daily life. 

On the anxiety end, trying to do the work I need to for grad school has caused me to feel tightness in my chest and shallow breathing, and a near panic attack the other day. This has been going on for the last month. 

On the depression end, I've gained about 14 lbs in the last month from daily binging and constant ordering from delivery, which has taken a financial toll, I haven't properly bathed or taken care of dental or other hygiene in I don't know how long, and I have no motivation. This has been going on for several months. 

The combination of these two conditions has made me try to force myself to try to get into a routine to improve things (which is hard to do with the lack of motivation) but whenever that happens the anxiety kicks in and I get overwhelmed. Otherwise I can't bring myself to do even basic things. 

I barely ever leave my dorm room and I don't have any friends I see IRL regularly. 

I've been on a medication regime for about a year now and, just like with other medications, they work for awhile and then stop and idk why the fuck this is happening. I was seeing a therapist up until September of last year when I moved for grad school, and I attended a workshop last week for skill building things against anxiety, but otherwise no real therapy type stuff. 

Should I check myself into a hospital? I'm scared they either won't let me in, or if I get in, they won't let me leave and the lack of control scares me and I'm worried I won't be able to contact loved ones and yeah...I'm an American student in Canada, if that makes any difference.",30Jun2019,2

117,"This happened like half an hour ago. I had a slight moment of jealousy because of a notification my SO received and it broke me. Had a panic attack for like 20 minutes or so, and I don't think this is normal. What should I do?

A bit of context:

My SO is an absolute gem, never did anything to make me question her. Tonight, she got a notification for a post she made on Instagram(it was a heart from a guy that she used to talk years ago, and I know that she isn't doing it anymore) to which she responded with a hug emoji. Knowing that they don't talk or anything, my brain instantly jumped to conclusions, questioning why would they do this. Worth noting is that all 3 of my previous relationships (one of which lasted for nearly 3 years) ended with me being cheated on, and the last one especially made it super hard for me to get attached to someone.",30Jun2019,1
118,"-A little bit of background: I have always been a very negative person. Ever since I was little I have felt that I am not capable of achieving my goals and I have found some kind of relief by being tough on myself: telling me that I deserve everything bad that happens to me and that I deserve more, that I do not deserve to be happy, and that I am a mistake. I have come to a point where trying to cheer myself up just feels... wrong. Sometimes I don't feel like socializing or doing anything at all, and my family scolds me because of that. I have tried talking to them about how I feel, but when I try to they just tell me that I am lucky that I have more than I need and that I do not have a reason to feel sad/bad. Every time I've tries to talk to a family member they just react aggressively, dismissing my feelings, so I save all my feelings for myself.
-Present: I am 20 y/o now, and I recently went abroad for 4 months and I have never felt more alive. I was happy, I felt like a new person. However, I did not miss anything from my home country: not my friends or family. When I returned home, all my happiness stayed abroad, and now I feel even worse than I did before. I just want to cry all day, I don't care about my college grades, or showering, or taking care of myself. I even want to die, but I do not dare to end my life because I do not want my family and boyfriend to suffer. I have been feeling like this for a while and I am just tired of pretending to be happy.

For about 20 minutes from that point I felt as if I wasn't real and I was even doubting everything that happened even before the message I received.

125,"I had a really bad break 3 years ago, where I couldn’t tell the difference between what was real and not, and it went on for 6 months. I was hearing things, seeing things, thinking the government was coming to kill me, everything was connected I was just delusional af and was about to kill myself when it just stopped, out of no where, nothing happened it just stopped which I don’t understand, I’m grateful it did but I don’t understand.

Around 2 months ago, my mum lost my prescription for my antidepressants, and I was too anxious to get some more, I started feeling really suicidal and I started getting abnormal thoughts, connecting things which were just stupid, and just making up stupid conspiracy theories with stuff which retrospectively made no sense. My girlfriend today said she wants to breakup up with me because over the last less than 2 months I’ve changed a lot, and I’ve been acting really differently, she didn’t know the extent of it. I should have told her. I explained everything to her, but in the end when she said about seeing no future for us she started crying and ran out my house, I ran after her and she broke up with me.

She said before 2 months ago it was completely fine, and everything was going great, I’ve only just realised today what I was thinking when I was talking to her. I didn’t connect what I was thinking with the episode, I didn’t think it was another one and I just don’t know how I didn’t - at this time my a-levels started, My counselling stopped after a year due to transitions to adult services, and I didn’t have my antidepressants. She said I was acting really weird saying conspiracy theories, saying stupid stuff about Jews controlling everything and holding onto the exams to make me fail (I love Jews and Jewish culture so it’s completely out of character and I don’t believe in any conspiracy theories), I also tied a noose around my neck and tried to kill myself, I then was staying awake for days at a time, I was doing my alevels and I saw no point to them or anything and I didn’t try (I’ve got 5A*s, 3As at gcse, with 297/300 on core alevel maths which I did early, I also have a place at the university with the highest paying graduate pay in the UK to study economics which I love, but it’s conditional on my alevels) so I know I failed them.

Please give advice on what to do, and what medicines can help I can’t have this happen again.

Thank you for reading

TLDR - I think I had another psychotic break, my girlfriend wants to break up, and I would really appreciate advice on medicines to try and how to live with this if at all. I’ve told doctors about it and i has therapy for around 7/8 months non stop every week which helped so much, also antidepressants which really helped. Therapy stopped due to transitioning to adult services, mum lost prescription so I stopped taking my antidepressants, and alevels started, became extremely delusional and I was acting very strange, I’ve only realised it now, because I can’t realise it when it’s happening, I have an appointment next month which I’ve been waiting for 2 and a bit months, I’m going to rebook it (mum booked holiday at the same time) and ask for an earlier appointment.

126,"Before I get into examples, yes I'm that person that people ignore in the conversation or the last person picked in a basketball pick up but it's more than that. I'm always overlooked and have to prove myself moreso than others. No one values or notices my efforts and I feel like I'm always put in the backburner.

Examples:
1- I'm really good at basketball probably one of the best in my gym. Sure im a little short but I'll always be the last one picked (players who I beat 21-0 in a one on one will get picked over me).  My opponents will score no points and I'll be scoring half the points. Soon as I miss, everyone just belittles me and will make sure to bring it up.

2- In my household, I'll try to have a say in something and I'll be shut down immediately. Even if what I'm saying is right, they will never admit to it unless someone else says it. There's so much moments where I want to say ""see I told you guys"" but you know, they'd belittle me.

3- I started student teaching. Out of all my cohorts, I'm the one that has so much behavior management issues in classroom. They do not listen to me but the next door student teachers students will listen to him and he's never prepared, doesn't care about the kids. 

4- Every teacher I have ever had was always astonished by my grades or productions because in the beginning, they always did not expect it out of me. Seen me as a low performing student.

I can go on and on. But i always feel like I'm the person no one regards and feel like a ghost in the room. I mean no one bullies me or disrespects me explicitly but they just don't recognize me.

 Degrees, money, material items never gave me recognition. I feel like I'm just not seen as bold and everyone walks all over me. I don't know what it is.",30Jun2019,1

129,"I've seen discussion recently on how we treat certain mental health conditions as abnormal, when actually it's not - eg. PTSD as a natural response to trauma, or depression as a normal response to the hell of our world currently.

My therapist has briefly suggested this is why he's not giving my CBT, because my depression is caused by the fact my life is shit - that how I feel about that is normal. Okay, fine, but I'm still left depressed and suicidal - surely I still should be learning how to cope with those feelings and that some feelings are perhaps able to be flipped. 

I think I struggle with this too...I have a damn good reason to be depressed, I don't find talking about it helpful but rather I want to know how to take action to try to improve my life (which in turn helps depression). I can't magic away depression with happy thoughts and denying reality.

I don't fully understand why but I know it was a turning point in my life, for reasons I don't remember fully I dropped out of school, I dropped out of my TAFE course 2 weeks before I wouldve gotten my qualification, stopped hanging out with my friends because the panic attacks were getting to be too much, I tried to kill myself for the first time, didnt tell anyone until 2013, got admitted to a psych ward for nearly 2 months at 16 and then the next 5 years are a blended blur because I was that crippled with anxiety that I couldn't leave my house, no rhyme or reason, I was simply just over life, I honestly dont know why. Thats my story, thats all I can HONESTLY tell you about my life. just a series of events that lead up to the end of 2018. the details? I could tell you about my eating disorder, and self harm issues, and dysfunctional family but it's no different to anyone else's story... from what I KNOW anyway. 


a little over 6 months ago I started getting snippets of ""memories"" from my childhood that led me to believe I was sexually abused, as time went on the story got pieced together and became more elaborate by the day, it made no sense whatsoever and the details kept changing and they are still fucking changing... so told myself that none of it was real. it has turned the past 6 months into a blur of psychotic? episodes unable to tell fact from fiction even in my present day life, and I ended up finding myself in a psych ward for most of may and June... I think. since being discharged I feel like my life has been turned upside down, I'm not scared of going outside anymore,  I went into a supermarket for the first time in years, I make my own appointments now, I take public transport, I'm trying to learn to drive again, It looks like things are getting better.


looks can be deceiving. my paranoia is at an all time high, i relapsed in self harm, my moods are all over the shop, i go from sitting on the bathroom floor razor in hand to having all the energy in the world I wouldn't say I'm happy but it's the closest I've been to it in years I smile and laugh and joke with my family but it doesn't feel authentic, I'm lost.


I'm currently being assessed for BPD and will be starting a DBT program this month, I'm trying to get my life together but I'm apathetic about it, I'm apathetic about life in general, I'm living for others and it's painful. BUT I'm still trying and thats all anyone can do really... i spend my days on mental health subs on reddit looking for answers for myself and being the biggest fucking hypocrite trying to get others to believe that life is worth living, I think I've helped to some extent, and lent an ear to those who need it but it doesn't feel like I'm doing enough, I don't want anyone to suffer, or struggle like I have, it can be debilitating at times, I will log off and the first post will be someone talking about wanting to kill themselves and I usually have it in me to talk them down but sometimes I shamefully admit that I just close the app and walk away, I feel so guilty for it, it's taxing reading through so much pain everyday but I'm doing the best I can. I know it's not my responsibility but I don't know I still feel responsible. I don't know what else to do with my life, I just want to help people.


none of this makes sense and I'm hungover for the first time in 4 years and im a bit of a mess but this the story of my life, don't even really know why I wrote it tbh.

133,"That's the line I hear from literally every person I and my mother knows.

I'm a 26 yr old male who suffers from (officially diagnosed) ADD, PTSD, extreme Depression, and Social Anxiety/Phobia; primarily due to the fact that I was repeatedly sexually abused for 2 years by my father as a kid. As a result, I'm still a grown adult who lives at home with his mother, with no job or even driver's license, and am still completely dependent on her as if I were still a teenager.

Absolutely nobody understands me, apart from my psychiatric medicine provider and personal counselor. Every other person in my life thinks that I'm just ""lazy"" and am ""taking advantage"" of my mother by ""mooching off her for free."" This also includes my mother, who's at times sympathetic and understanding, while at other times is extremely toxic and scolding me for the exact same accusatory shit.

Just what in the actual fuck leads so many people to assume this nonsense? Do they actually think I want to not have any friends? Do they actually think I want to not have the freedom to drive where I want to? Do they actually think I want to still be a virgin and to have never go on dates? Do they actually think I want to not have any money to my name? Do they actually think I want to only be provided by my mother with basic necessities like food, water, and shelter; but then when it comes to any sort of hobbies or interests she always tells me: ""If you want to do anything fun that you're interested in, then you're just gonna have to man up and get a job to pay for it yourself"" - which only leaves me sitting here hollow and empty for years to come since that's just not how mental health works? 

Do they actually think I want to live as a hermit, with absolutely nothing to my name, entirely dependent on my mother just to stay alive? What the actual fuck do they think I'm taking advantage of here? My basic survival!?

This kind of mentality is so damn prevalent that it only makes me even more anxious and terrified of social interaction, which only leads me to retreat even further into my own ""safe space"" at home. This is why so many people suffer through mental illness, because society seems to actively lead people like me to only have our mental conditions deteriorate even further.",30Jun2019,1
134,"I have had anxiety and depression for over a decade, but now at the age of 24 I’ve recently gone through a severe episode that has kept me from work and even fully socializing. I am up all night and sleeping most of the day. Not exercising. Not taking care of myself. Eating poorly. 

Something that has coincided with this episode is a significant decrease is cognitive ability. It’s harder for me to talk. My thoughts are slower. I can’t focus. When I do speak it takes me longer to articulate things than it used to. I repeat words in sentences. 

I’m very alarmed by this as I have always been very sharp, even with depression and anxiety. I’ve sent myself into a panic that something horrific is happening and I have no idea what to do. I want to go to the neurologist and get my brain checked, but all the tests for liver, heart, lungs and main functions are “normal” so I’m not sure what’s going on. 

Can severe depression and anxiety impact cognition that severely? Or is it likely something else? I feel stuck and scared.",30Jun2019,3
135,"TL;DR I don't make good decisions for myself no matter how hard I try, and only realize what I should've done AFTERWARDS, no matter how hard I think it through. I don't know why.

I can't seem to do anything right. I try my hardest to make good decisions but I keep fucking up and hating myself afterwards. 

I say things to people, like my therapist and doctor, for example, and I think ""why did I say that? Now they might think this or this or this"" and I hate myself and always think ""if only I thought about it more"" (I mean how in the world can I screw up a conversation about how I feel? I find a way!) And so I think about things more, and after a good deal of thought I think, ""ok I think I'm alright, I think this will explain what I mean best"" and then I say it and think ""why did I say that? Now they're not gonna understand or think (insert misleading negative and incorrect falsehood) about me!""

It's mostly things I say, I say something to someone, regardless of whether or not I thought it through, and then realize what I should've said, only after it's too late.

I seem to fail at explaining how I feel, or making a good decision almost all the time. I overthink it so much that I can't see common sense or think of a logical way to handle my problems. 

Only after the fact is when I think of a better way to go about things. My hindsight and self hatred are the only logical things about me. Why?? Why can't I be a reasonable, logical and a good decision maker when I need to be?

I'm great at giving other people advice, I never hate the advice I give other people, I'm actually proud of it. Idk why I can't give MYSELF good advice.

It's like when I need to help myself my brain just breaks and spins out of control.

I have a lot of diagnoses, I'm not sure which one(s) apply to this. OCD, ASD, GED, basically every anxiety disorder in the book, ADHD, past trauma, And I think there are more, it's hard to keep track... Just in case that's important info.

Does anyone else have this problem?",30Jun2019,1
136,"It usually hasn’t been a huge problem of mine. But recently, I made a mistake and it opened the floodgates for me to feel guilty about every significant mistake I’ve made in my life. In the past I had been good at compartmentalising it, but now it seems like it’s made its way to the surface and I can’t shake it. Each time I forgive myself for something in the past, something new comes up that I can’t stop focusing on.",30Jun2019,2
137,"I was having a good day. I went to therapy yesterday and it was a good session. I spent today preparing for a roadtrip that I'm taking this week that I'm excited for. I felt pretty great.

Then I opened my email for work to see what was on my calendar tomorrow. I wasn't planning to actually read the emails, but the first email that popped up was a bad one and I couldn't look away. It made me feel really stressed out and I started to cry.

Now I'm sad. Sad about my job that I am becoming more and more unhappy with. Sad about my life that is so overwhelming. Sad that I cant hold onto the good days because the bad things always come back. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore, but I dont know if that's a realistic goal. Sure, I could quit my job and find a different one, but they're all going to be terrible. I feel unfulfilled. I feel like the things I really want are in opposition to what I need to do to survive in society. 

I feel sad and I don't want to be. I want my good day back.",30Jun2019,6
138,"Ever since I joined Reddit and discovered all the support given on this sub and others, my mind feels like it's on overdrive. There are so many different things I want to talk about that I am not even sure where to begin, but I don't want to spam the subs lol.  But then I also get self-conscious about posting and *where* to post. \*pulls at hair\* I know I'm just overthinking. Hopefully this will be the first step.",30Jun2019,1
139,"I’m sorry, I don’t know how to structure this. I keep trying and it’s wrong every time. 

There’s just so much.. I come from a broken family, was basically a foster child in my own family.. given up and taken in repeatedly by different aunts and uncles, then sent away when it became too much. I wasn’t even a bad kid? I never understood, but I never questioned it. I never questioned anything. 

I never knew affection or love. Just the feeling of being a burden, the feeling of rejection and being sent away. I never formed bonds with people. I have severe commitment issues, and am severely introverted. Sometimes. I can be a social butterfly sometimes, and love interacting *with strangers*. Sometimes. I have no consistency. 

I have no close friends, no one I trust. I am alone. 

When my father died, I was the one who found him, one week rotted and his face partially eaten by his dog. But I was actually relieved at his passing. 

When my first girlfriend died, I was broken. I gave up on my studies and dropped out of school. When my grandfather died, his last words were of disappointment at that fact. Those words ring in my head, because honestly.. I am sort of a disappointment. Our family is a well off one, prestigious and chock full of good genes. And I could be the best of them. But I have no motivation. Life fucking sucks. 

I’ve been homeless, I’ve been a junkie for both boy and girl, I’ve worked my way out of the gutter for no other reason than it’s just what I should do. I have no drive. I have a nice apartment now, a good job that I hate, I live with my sister who I love but.. don’t really feel connected to. 

I think about suicide often.. much more often lately but I don’t think I’d actually do it? If I did, I think I would get everything in order, sell stuff and line up possessions for particular people I know. I would tie up loose ends, then just wander into the woods, far removed from people, and just.. let it be done. 

But I couldn’t do it. Because I know that pain.. and it’s the worst. Seven years ago, my first girlfriend committed suicide. She hung herself with a small rope from a door handle. It broke me. 

But I grieved, alone, and moved on. Or so I thought. But here I am, seven years later, lost and wandering through this dark expanse that is life, and I can’t stop thinking about her. I think I just buried it. I think I just bury everything. 

People comment on how I keep it all together with everything I’ve been through. The truth is, I hadn’t thought about it much. I think people respected that.

But the simple truth is just that.. I hadn’t thought about it. I just.. accepted it and moved on. I buried it. 

I feel so aimless and lost, and every day is just tedium, I do it because it’s what I should do. But I don’t want to any more. 

I don’t want to die, but I also don’t want to live. You know? 

I need help.. because this isn’t how I want to live. I’m only twenty seven.. I cant do this for another fifty some odd years. I won’t. 

I need a purpose. Please. 

Please, I need help.

What do I do?",30Jun2019,1
140,"This has been with me for awhile. I have other conditions that I know about, namely mild anxiety, aspergers, and ocd. But anyway I digress. I seem to have terrible a time making up my mind on anything. I will give a couple examples. I was asked if I wanted ice cream, but I liked strawberry and vanilla equally. I was so paralyzed by indecision that I got nothing at all. I got a video game where you got to choose your character. I couldn't decide should I be a wizard, a warrior, an archer. Then you had to choose your race. I simply couldn't decide. It's been 2 months and I still can't play that game, sometimes I just sit on the creation screen with internal debates. It's almost like in all of these cases I'm so afraid of making the wrong decision and regretting it later, that I end up doing nothing at all. Is this abnormal?",30Jun2019,3

143,"Hi everyone!

I was prescribed Viibryd by my psychiatrist. I'm currently on day 3 of it, and of course nothing is happening yet. I was given GeneSite testing to see which medications would work best with my genetics. It was covered (thankfully) and Viibryd was one of 4 medicines that would work best.

I agreed with my psychiatrist that it sounds best for me, and agreed to try it, and yet I'm still nervous. I was given Zoloft before by a previous doctor, and it didn't work at all. That was reflected on the test with ""reduced efficacy."" 

My reason for this post is just to express my anxiety about my medicine. I don't want it to not work again, even though I have scientific evidence showing it is one of few that will work best. How can I work past it? I don't want my anxiety getting to a point where I don't want to take it anymore. What are some ways I can comfort myself?",30Jun2019,1
144,"TW: speak of trauma, suicide, self harm, disordered eating


I was diagnosed with anxiety with depression and borderline personality disorder traits.

My traumas are starting to bite me in the ass. Being chased by some of my biggest anxieties again. I started counselling to try and stop whatever it is in its tracks, but on my second visit my counsellor was falling asleep on me, which awakened my anxieties tenfold. 

I have tried to kill myself 3 times. Theres been mania, hallucinations, self harm, unsafe sex/drug use, starving, binging, disordered eating, forced vomiting and more in my past. That was a result of my trauma as a kid, but now I'm realising that I traumatised myself with these actions. Funny how that works.

Paranoia is attacking me. I moved to a nice new flat recently. One day I was in and heard banging that I'm sure was in the attic. Now, at night I feel like I'm being watched. I'm having recurring nightmares. My partner came over last night and I hoped his presence would calm my dreams down (it has in the past): instead I dreamt he cheated on my with my flatmate, looked for a house with me then called me a 'psycho' then I went mad in my dream, screaming and crying and being a bit wild.

I kind of ignored how bad it got previously because it was bad for so long (started self harming at 8 years old, didn't really start to manage my mental health until I was about 20, now I'm 22). Professionals generally ignored my other symptoms and just diagnosed the depression and anxiety but I always felt something was missing, a part of the puzzle. My mood, even when I was managing well, fluctuated so crazy. I never feel steady. I can be totally calm, and then something inside me flips the hyper switch, then the depressed switch, then the angry switch, then the empty switch, all within somewhere between 2hrs and 24hrs. I'm exhausted constantly. I don't want to ignore it again. 

I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do and I've never been very good at talking about it to friends or family, only writing it down for strangers on the internet. I work full time which can be really tough on my mental health, especially because I work in care supporting people with physical and learning disabilities, mental illness and more so it can be taxing some days.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I'm in Scotland, so maybe if anyone knows of any services here? This I guess would be my first big relapse since I was consistently mentally ill for years before it rested. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle that? Reassurances or advice in general would be nice.

Thanks a lot for even reading this if you did. I appreciate that even, knowing I've been heard. A response would be nice if you can handle that. Or send some positive energy my way and once I'm better I'll do my best to channel that.

Sending all my love to those who need it! x",30Jun2019,2
