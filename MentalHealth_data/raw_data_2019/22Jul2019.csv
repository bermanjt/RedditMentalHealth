0,"Hey, I'm not a frequent redditor or anything like that. So apologies in advance if this is not the correct place to post this. I just needed somewhere to vent to. 

I feel like I'm worthless, and I don't see my value as a human being. I've always seemed to have some sort of mental issues, but those signs got ignored and i learned to bottle everything up instead. I have been seeing a counselor for the past 2-3 years now and feel like there has been no progress. She's told me she's seen it, but I don't believe her. I still feel just as stupid and ignorant as back then. 

I don't believe people care about me, or love me like they say they do. When I tell someone I love them, I mean it, however i just feel so empty and hollow when i hear it back. It almost hurts, but it's more just uncomfortable knowing that their love, care, affection ( of any kind, platonic, or romantic) will never make it past my ears. 

I've been on a few different medications in the past few years. The first anti-depressant I tried worked perfectly. I hated them. I stopped taking them regularly and with the correct dosage and I was all over the place mentally for a while. I was eventually taken off of them because of that. Others I tried didn't work so well giving me side effects. Nothing major but enough for it to be obvious to those around me. I didn't mind those ones. 

I've done a lot of thinking since then and I just don't have the desire to be happy. I don't have the motivation to help myself achieve anything with my life. I feel I deserve to be sad and that I shouldn't be anything else. I can't tell anyone as I just can't physically bring myself to do so. I've been trying to make out small cries for help to close friends but they don't ever catch on. I only blame myself for it though. 

I think about suicide often but don't have a plan. The only  thing that's really stopping me from it is that I want it. I know that living is worse and because I don't deserve to be happy and being sad is really just good enough for me. When I'm not sad I'm not feeling anything and I'll find a way to make myself sad again. I don't do it on purpose, it just kinda happens. I used to cut myself and do other things to cause physical harm to myself. But now I just make sure there's never a time in the day where I think highly about anything about me now. 

Whenever I have the chance I make fun of myself. whether it's my appearance, personality, etc.. and I just laugh it off as if it's nothing, and the cycle repeats. All day, everyday. I hate myself so much. 

P.S. I hope this is readable, my heads a bit scattered.",22Jul2019,3
1,"Hey everyone, sometimes I get a really weird out-of-it high feeling where my senses and cognition seem to change. I see the world differently (brighter colors, best way I can describe it is that things look more vivid/real). Also what I focus on and how seems to change during these periods, making some mental tasks harder than normal (I think maybe I’m just not used to it). This is the same feeling I had when trying antidepressants a year ago and stopped them afterwards.

IF I TAKE THEM

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, both my partner and I lost our jobs. It hurt us a lot both financially and mentally. I have almost a week left of my pills left if I take them like I'm supposed to and maybe a two weeks and a few days if I space them out. I tried spacing them out though, and it was NOT fun. By the second day, I was a raging mess. I was mean, yelling and in pain. I threatened to leave so many times. I couldn't get out of bed with the pain. How my partner managed to put up with me is beyond me. He's a saint. 

&amp;#x200B;

I start my new job on the 29th which is coming up but I'm still stressing. I won't get paid for two weeks and I need those pills to make sure I can be a normal adult at work. I don't want them to think I'm this crazy mess.

I mean, I am, but not WITH these pills.

Taking medications really messes with your identity. Which one is the real me? Am I just like this because it's a withdrawal? Or is this who I really am? What happened in my brain that made me need these to appear ""normal""? 

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't know who I'm supposed to be without these meds but I have to space them out until I get paid again. I'm just scared/worried that I'll do something crazy again(like threatening to break up jst because it was too hot outside).",22Jul2019,3

8,"Hi all, 

I would like some opinions on what my mental health problems are.

First off I want to say that since I was younger I had this vivid imagination, so much so that it pulled me out of my surroundings. For example the teacher would be speaking in school and I would be constantly daydreaming. Was often described as a rogue and had some behavioral problems.

The closest I can gather is adhd, although that doesn’t quite seem enough. I also thought possibly Aspergers but also doesn’t seem like it. I don’t really have any difficulty understanding people, just don’t seem to care as much as other kids. 

Now flash forward to in my early twenties (I am 25 years old and male I should mention) and my mental heath isn’t good. I am constantly thinking and not focusing on my surroundings. Thinking about life in an existential way over and over and not motivated to do anything productive, goals etc.

I feel as though i am alone and nobody understands me, this has caused me to isolate myself and slip on a mask when I do talk to people. The worst part is people seem to notice in disturbed at times at work which is stressful and making things worse.

I have been to doctors but as I live in Ireland mental health support is limited at best .

I know that’s a concise description but if anyone has any idea or input either from first or second hand experience what I’m describing then I would appreciate any help..

Thanks.",22Jul2019,0
9,"I’m really not sure if this is the right sub or if this is even above Reddit’s pay grade.. but here we go. 

I have a middle aged brother who’s had a couple of run ins with the law, he’s been in SPED classes for the majority of his life and was recently diagnosed with paranoia and anxiety disorder. His IQ is extremely low and in the mid 50’s range. 

My mom doesn’t do anything for him, he mostly stays at home by himself with limited to no social interaction. I recently graduated and I’m now in a position that I can help him financially so I take him out every week and we go to the store. I’m trying to reintegrate him back into society because my mom will not be around forever and he needs stimulation. 

Lately he’s been into OANN. An extremely conservative news channel that spouts inaccurate political information- my brother watches it nonstop. He wants me to purchase a book from one of the main speakers and I really don’t want too. 

I don’t know what to do or where to go with this information, not only am I worried about the ideologies he’s creating but I’m worried that he won’t be able to read the content of the book and his insecurities will develop even further.

So this experience is quite new to me. I am currently in a sort-of-LDR-but-not-really with my ex boyfriend, because I will be seeing him in a week (we live in different countries) for the last time before we break up to go to university. For the past two months, we have been texting a bit, and calling too. 

However, for the past months I have been hit by pangs of extreme nervousness where I feel queasy, nauseous, and like I have no motivation to do anything. I mostly just lie on my bed or watch dumb videos. It usually corresponds to something he's doing; maybe I realized he never initiated to call me, or that he didn't text me back for a few hours. It sucks because we aren't technically together, so I understand that he's busy because I am too and I do the exact same to him. But this anxiety (?) is extremely illogical.

14,"This is my first reddit post; there will probably be profanity. I don't come on here much, but I just really need to vent right now because I've spent the past hour crying, I have to be up for work in 5 hours so I really need to go to sleep, and my partner used all the milk after the shop shut so I can't even have a fucking cup of tea (yes, I'm British). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 28 (f) and I have PTSD as result of childhood abuse. Things have been really hard for the past almost three years. In Oct 2016, I suffered a spinal herniation between my L4&amp;L5 vertabrae that left me housebound and barely able to walk for seven months. It was really scary. I didn't know if I'd be able to walk properly again or if I'd be able to dance (I'm not good, but I love dancing around my house). As it was, I was left with potentially permanent nerve damage that causes daily back, hip, thigh, knee, calf, and foot pain.   


My then new relationship took a pretty hard hit too. We'd been together for two months but we'd been housemates for a couple of years before that. He took pretty good care of me for the first few weeks but as it became clearer that I wasn't getting better, he pulled back. He'd ask me how I was and then when I told him how tired I was, how much pain I was, how scared I was, he would pause and then go 'But it's getting better, right?' I was so frustrated and scared, and I felt so alone with it because it was clear my partner could not cope. And part of me didn't blame him - he didn't sign up for this, but then, neither did I, and what I needed wasn't for him to 'take care' of me in a physical sense (things were a real struggle and they took longer, but I took pride in doing them myself) but for him to provide emotional support and comfort in what was a very scary time for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

While this was going on, I applied for assistance from the government (PIP) to help cover the extra cost of things like having to get taxis everywhere, a new 'ergonomic' mattress, a robotic vacuum cleaner...just stuff that will make my life a lot easier and less painful. I was rejected and I was expecting that (they have an 80% rejection target) so I went through the process of appealing.

&amp;#x200B;

I got better enough to go back to work but the chronic sciatic pain has been up and down a lot ever since. The standard of healthcare that's come with it has also been up and down and as a result, I've had a lot of time off work. So much so, that last year they tried to fire me for being too sick. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just after that process started, I got a letter saying a date had been set for my PIP tribunal. I'd already been struggling for months after a medication change for the sciatica had meant I'd had to come off my regular SSRI for PTSD, but the PIP stuff on top of the work stuff and my rapidly declining physical health was too much.  I suffered a complete PTSD relapse just before Christmas and that was another 5 months off work. 

&amp;#x200B;

The PIP hearing took place two years after my original claim and resulted in me being told that I was winning this appeal, but because the DWP had fucked up my case so spectacularly, I would have to appeal AGAIN. So the whole thing won't be resolved one way or another until next year at the earliest. They backdate payments to the date of your original claim, and by my calculations, if I was eligible for the lowest rate, I would have received over £12k by now, which really would have helped me in terms of things like transport and aids/equipment.  

&amp;#x200B;

The hearing with work took place not long after. I fought them and I won, but it was really close and I had no job security and was 'living' off nothing but sick pay for 5 months. In the end, I had to go down to part-time hours because full-time was taking everything out of me and making me sicker, but they wouldn't give me the 25 hour contract I requested (which would be JUST enough for me to live off) on the basis that the remaining hours would be too difficult to fill so they offered 21. I had no choice but to take that offer or I wouldn't have a job at all. I'm now £100 short on my monthly income (at least, depending on the month), which I've managed to make up through borrowing or begging money or selling stuff but I'm running out of options unless I come up with another source of regular income soon. I cannot borrow any more money. I'm already about 5k in the hole and it's just getting worse and I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit, that because of my mental health issues, I'm not great with money anyway. I smoke weed to help manage my PTSD and the pain and I know I've been smoking more than I can afford but without the SSRI I used to take, I have no other way to manage the PTSD. THC inhibits the body's ability to make adrenaline. When I'm stressed, I avoid things (which is a classic PTSD trait) and that ends up making money stuff worse, but I can't control it. It's kind of worse, knowing that, because it means you get to watch yourself make bad decisions while you get frustrated about how you can't stop yourself. Which would sound totally insane to anyone who'd never had mental health issues, but I'm hoping someone out there in void gets it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The previously mentioned relationship is in the toilet right now because he just can't maintain emotional intimacy through challenging times and I don't have the energy to keep trying to rebuild the bridges he keeps burning, so to speak. Every time things are bad, he pulls away and I feel like I have to deal with everything on my own again, and then when they get better, he's right there like he never left. It's confusing and hurtful and I'm tired of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of almost everything actually. I don't actively want to commit suicide but my brain is already going 'Nope. This is too hard. Dying has got to be better than this bullshit, right?' I just feel alone all the time, I'm sick of worrying about money, I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. I just want someone to wrap me up in a blanket and take me away from all of this for a bit.

Well recently I have been thinking I might have Erotomania.  

I have this celebrity crush and admittedly,  I can be a hopeless romantic with a wild imaginatiom even if sometimes I know there are things that will not happen realistically.

And then he posts a pic with another friend today explaining he was with old friends AND of course reasonably i know its not for me, i know its just cos he wants to post or maybe hes doing damage / media control.

16,"To start I love my family and I really love my parents especially, I feel like I've been truly bless with the family I got. A little back ground I have one older brother and one older sister, both of whom are married happily. I grew up in a fairly poor family but my parents have always made ends meet, and always gave us the love and support any child could want, for this I love them. This will all be relevant soon. 

I feel like for the past couple months I have been coming to the realization that I havent been living a healthy life. I think I have a pornagraphy addiction, and chronic stress for so many reasons that I can't event begin to list them for a couple of years and its all slowly adding up. I noticed there would be times where I would just not want to get out of bed and eat junck food. I thought it was a normal part of life like when you over work yourself you just need time to relax. However, recently this has been happening more and more and this time  since I been in my room for a couple days only leaving to do whats necessary so people dont start asking questions, I have been thinking a lot about suicide, like more than normal. However because my parents are so damn great my mom has been coming in my room asking me if im ok and I keep playing it off as if im studying and giving fake smiles. 

The only reason I havent really considered suicide or just running away and living somewhere else to start a new life is because of them. I know they love me a lot and I love them, and if I killed myself they would go into depression. They already had a tough life and I would be the little shit who makes it worse for them. 

Now here is the messed up part because of that reason I've been hopeing in the near future they would jusy die. I wish they would die a peaceful death together so neither of them would have to be lonly when the other has passed away. If they were to pass away together that would give me the opportunity to really just restart my life. Even though I love my siblings I wouldn't really care leaving them because they are both married and happy with their lives.

(Throwaway account)

This happened last night.. I'm still trying to process what happened. To medical professionals that read this-- first of all, I'd like to apologize. I respect the heck out of what you guys do and if I was in my right mind I would never try to make light of your jobs of saving lives. I'd would like some advice on maybe what happened to my brain that I did what I did. That wasn't me. What I did and the decisions that led to it were incredibly stupid and I am definitely in the middle of some serious introspection. I'm considering therapy. 

I'll get to the story. I'll preface by saying that it has been a rough couple of weeks, financially and emotionally. I need an expensive surgery in a couple weeks, which will also put me out of work for 6+ weeks. I totaled my $10k car that I just took comprehensive insurance off. (Stupid, I know. I bought another car and especially with my surgery in a couple weeks, I felt like it wasn't worth paying comprehensive/collision insurance on two cars when I would only be driving the first car for another week. Murphy's law.) So I was already in a rough place mentally. I just felt (and continue to feel) kind of numb to what happens to me.

Cut to my night last night. My buddy and I have tickets to a concert, and plan on taking the party bus up there. I haven't eaten much all day cuz I was working my butt off trying to get a job done. But the party bus picks up at a restaurant, so we order a couple burritos. I've been on a couple party buses before, so I decide to pre-game with my buddy at the restaurant. Should have eaten the burritos before, but the bus picks up in about 10 minutes so we start doing shots, thinking we will eat on the bus. All told, I had 4 or 5 tequila shots and a couple margaritas. We get on the party bus. My buddy brought champagne and whiskey. Completely forgot about the burritos, we pass around the champagne and start drinking the whiskey. Probably 5 or 6 more shots worth. Someone was passing around a joint, and I took probably 3 or so long drags. Its been about 4 years since I've smoked weed last, so I'm sure just that would have hit me hard anyway. But its definitely been the first time I've been drunk and high, much less that drunk. And I know alcohol multiplies the THC levels by several times in your body.

All that said, everything hit me like a freight train. We got off the bus, were standing in line to get in, and I passed out. I know that was real. The next thing I remember is 8 medics (my friend who is kind of no longer my friend told me how many today) working on me. Here's the crazy thing: for the rest of the night, I was aware. For some messed-up reason, I decided to see what I could make the team working on me believe. I couldn't believe what I was able to do with my body at the time. I'm absolutely positive it was the booze/drugs, but I was able to relax my heartbeat to the point where the doctors were screaming for the defibrillator (they didn't end up using it). Through the course of the night, which ended up lasting a few hours, I was attended to by the entire medical staff at the concert venue, medical professionals from the hospital, the guy in the ambulance, and the team in the ER. I was still drunk and high, but hyper-aware of my body and what they were saying and what I needed to do to make them think I was about to die. I feel so bad for them now. They shoved a tube up my nose and I didn't flinch at all. I remember someone saying around me ""He's definitely out cold."" They stuck an extra large IV in me, had to cut my shirt open, did chest compressions at one point. I'm black and blue today. My pain tolerance was crazy at the time, but I remember all of that. My friend told me today he was 100% sure I had died, that I was the stillest body he had ever seen.

I remember getting a wild hair and breaking character to talk to the guy in the ambulance. He was floored. I remember going back into my possum act before I arrived at the hospital and I think I vaguely remember the ambulance paramedic trying to convince the hospital staff I was faking it.

Once I was in the hospital, I started to think how I was going to get out of the situation. I tried to rip off everything and make a break for it. Not a good idea-- my arm is severely bruised from taking the IV out. It took a few people to get me back in the bed, and they put restraints on me. I fessed up to the nurse, who eventually took me out of restraints. The security guard and I actually became fairly good friends by the time I was released-- he thought it was all funny and let me use his phone.

I'm still trying to figure out why I did all of it. I was definitely not in my right mind-- it's going to cost a fortune in medical fees for me. And at the time, I knew it was more than a prank. I thought that I could actually help the medical community by what I was doing, or at the very least be picked up by the media for a couple bucks. I'm also not saying I was lucid the entire time, but when I was, I was hyper-aware of what I was doing with my mind and body and it was honestly incredible.

I'm a fairly impulsive and pranky kind of guy, and also the type of guy to do things just to prove to myself that I can do it. I can give more anecdotes from my past. But this takes it to a whole new level. I'm not sure if it was the crossfading or if I need therapy.",22Jul2019,1
19,"I'll be honest, I don't know if this is even the right sub to go to. But the sub description says I can vent so I'll do so.

There is something seriously wrong with me. For the past few years, I've been having these episodes. If there's a trigger then I don't know what it is. But all of a sudden I'll have these really depressing thoughts. Almost like a voice in my head. ""You're nothing. You're worthless. You're a disgusting piece of shit and you deserve to die alone, just like the worthless scum you are."" And these thoughts just keep filling my brain until I finally lose control and break down. Crying, screaming, and shaking relentlessly. And when my breakdown is over, I just feel nothing. No emotions. 

It feels like there's no reason for these episodes to happen. I honestly have it pretty good. I have a few friends, a mother that loves me and will do anything for me, and a hobby that makes me feel accomplished. In other words, there are plenty of people who have it way worse than I do. But these episodes, or attacks or whatever, still happen to me, and every time it feels like I'm going to explode. I end up just feeling worthless. Like I'm nothing but a nuisance and an inconvenience to those around me. Like I should isolate myself. I don't know. It just feels like everything is crumbling down on me, when in reality, everything is probably fine. 

To be clear, in these episodes, I have never thought of harming myself or ending my life. Wishing I never existed in the first place, yes, but not ending my life. I would never want to do that to my mom or my family.

So this year has been rough. I dont like thinking 
about it that way, I know other people are dealing with way more than I am, but it just seems like I cant catch a break. 

I was happily engaged to a girl I had been with for almost four and a half years. I knew she had some emotional baggage (her whole family was like a bad reality show irl) and i was prepared to handle that. To be fair, I've got my share of problems, too, and I made my share of mistakes. But I recognized them and worked my hardest to atone and make up for them. I put my dreams and ambitions on hold, I plunged myself into an industry I absolutely hated with every five of my being, just to make ends meet and try to support her endeavors. I fucked the whole college thing up, but she was maintaining. I voluntarily chose to be the only source of income so she could focus on her studies. After 3 years, though something changed. She did a 180 on her major views, which I tried to look past, but fighting was a given on a good day. Pretty soon summer rolled around and she'd leave me to myself for weeks at a time going on trips with her family. I felt isolated. Due to disagreements and an unhealthy amount of jealousy, I had basically cut all ties to everybody I knew that she didnt or didnt approve of. I was all in. I wanted to prove that. So i had nobody while she was gone. When she got back after her 2nd or 3rd trip that summer, we had a bad fight. I basically asked her to go stay with her mom until i got back from a business trip, explaining i think she could use some one on one time to figure things out. 

I guess she did, because the morning i left, she came in and cleared out the house without a word. I had tried to call that morning telling her i was sorry and just wanted to get back to the way it used to be over a voicemail. No reply until after the deed was done. I came home to our cats, sad and confused, no blanket on my bed, my clothes placed here and there and my tv and the like in the floor where the entertainment center used to be. 

As you might have guessed I started spiraling. I started drinking heavily, which eventually led to a brief stint of substance abuse. With nobody else to focus on I was left with my own problems. I'm bipolar manic depressive with panic disorder. Not a good combination. I went to see a doctor to address this, and my options were to be institutionalized and risk losing my job, or take antidepressants. People with bipolar disorder should NOT be prescribed those, but I had to choose or I was going to be forced into the institution that the office worked with. She deemed me a danger to myself. So I took the lesser evil. Two months later was my first suicidal episode. Two weeks after that was my second. She changed my medication and i was so manic it hurt. I burned through 3 grand in a month on god knows what, and my substance abuse was getting bad. I was attaching myself to people who had similar demons and allowing myself to be crushed. 

I finally had a psych appointment coming up that I desperately needed. The month of, my company decided to scrape together every bit of info they could to fire me. I was a manager, my employees loved working with me, and I showed results, despite being so young in my position. But the family that owned the company had recently put one of their own in charge as CEO. They fired me immediately after I brought in 1/4 of a million dollars. And canceled my insurance to the end of the month. I started drinking more. The job market here is trash. 

I've been coming back around financially, slowly getting to where it isnt a problem. But I'm struggling socially and romantically. I dont trust it anymore. I dont want to be attached ever again. It's been almost a year. I should be over this. I quit my meds, they weren't helping anyway, and I cant afford insurance or get govt assistance for my health. My family is always worried. It seems like they're walking on eggshells around me. I havent had more than 3 hours of solid sleep in over 2 years. 

TL;DR
Fiance left after 4 1/2 years, I lost my job shortly after, fell into and out of alcoholism and drug abuse, had two suicidal episodes in the last year, and several borderline. I cant seem to catch a break.

22,"So I don’t have money to go see a therapist or anything like that but I believe I have crippling social anxiety.

I go out with friends a lot and can even be the life of the party but when I’m at home the thought of going outside terrifies me. So a lot of the time I won’t return home for weeks. Then when I am home I won’t leave for weeks except to go to work.

When meeting new people I kinda freak out for some reason. My mind pulls blanks on what to say and I try to smile to look confident but then my chin and cheeks twitch and tremble uncontrollably. I start to sweat real bad and my brain freaks out and I feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable and self-conscious.

Usually drugs and alcohol helps reduce this behavior and the thoughts but if I take too much it makes it 100 times worse.

Some back story; She had a lot of trauma growing up as a child and also was diagnosed with BPD, Anxiety and Depression. She always told me that she feels as if there are 3 things inside her, sort of like personalities but she doesnt know that they speak to each other. 

We were hanging out having fun when we had an arguement about a topic we had a misunderstanding in. She got very very upset and then started talking as if there were multiple people. Her first personality that showed was a sort of aggresive one and had asked if i recognized her. After that the second personality was that of a little girl, it was he not close enough to really have namr when she was 8 and told me things that my friend had otherwise forgotten now, third was a personality that protected her from emotions. Her third personality told me that they werees they were really more like personalities each one having a job to do and said that my friend was keeping back monsters inside her but just gave up and they couldnt find her. Eventually she regained her own conciousness and thought she fell asleep not knowing what happened. Now im confused and im not really sure if i should tell her.",22Jul2019,0

26,"I posted this is r/depression too, things are tough though and I need all the support I can get, hope that’s ok. 

Backstory: My life is a dumpster fire. I’d stayed clean since NYE, decided to get on it one night for “a bit of fun” and ruined everything I’d achieved in a matter of hours. 

I’ve fucked my relationship after spending 6 months repairing it, she’s still around but I’m certain it’s out of pity and fear of what will happen if she leaves, I’ve told her she can go and I won’t do anything silly, apologised endlessly, but I can see the resentment in her eyes and feel the lack of love. I feel awful for dragging her through the shit I’ve created. It’s just a matter of time before that ends and deservedly so, she deserves better. 

I’ve got myself a possession of cocaine charge, nothing major, but enough to derail the career I’ve been working hard to create for the past few years, something that gave me true meaning and felt rewarding, now that’s gone. 

I’ve done everything right, therapy, meds, exercise and I still fucked it all up, now beyond repair. 

My plan now is to just leave, I’ll let the court proceedings go ahead, I don’t want to be a fugitive, but once that’s done I’m out. I’ll leave my family a note, take my grandfather on one last fishing trip then fly out of the country. I plan using my savings to stay in a backpackers for a bit, let loose, engage in some self destructive behaviour, then just see where life takes me. I feel the only choice is this or stay here and end myself. 

I’m not even sure what I’m trying to get out of this post, there’s no one I can talk to about this and I just need to get it out. Has anyone else felt this way? Done the same thing, or know of anyone who has? How has it gone for you/them?",22Jul2019,11
27,"I can’t tell if young people now have more incidents of mental health struggles then we did in the 90s or if it’s that young people are more open to talking about it. I see young people on social media talking openly about having anxiety and depression and very few of us would’ve been strong enough to do so in the 90s it was something embarrassing that we kept hidden. Myself included.  But I can also see how teens today spent so much time on social media and less time with in person interactions and also have so much more pressure in terms of getting into college, getting jobs, being able to afford sky high rent and having to pay massive amounts of money mostly in debt for university.",22Jul2019,0
28,"I'm losing all interest as all that my parents ever do is fight. They have been through a lot. Also they are quite older than conventional parents and I'm their only child. Not sure if this is the right sub, pls direct me if im wrong.

Some background: -

About a year and  half ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer. This took a toll on everybody especially her. She lost extreme amounts of weight and that combined with chemo has been very tough on her. Her attitude has changed drastically and her differences with my dad have escalated quite a bit. She can be pretty bitter sometimes. But I don't blame her. Things like this do change lives. My dad on the other hand has also been through a lot. Growing up with a family of 8 with him being the sole breadwinner and all his 3 brothers being unemployed drunks has given has affected him. Ever since he married my mom and I was born, he has picked himself up and today we three live a rather comfortable life life. But now he is just tired. Throughout my mom's treatment he has been running about chasing everything from doctors to funds. I'm afraid age is doing its part. He too gets extremely cranky. Just yesterday, my mom (who has been very bored because she is still weak and has been stuck at home), suggested that she and dad go out as it was a Sunday. However, my dad has been working effortlessly through the week and just wanted to rest at home. Hence a fight ensued and as always I ended up being stuck in the middle.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand both their situations but am at an absolute loss at what to do. The thing is I've always been a smart kid throughout school and am soon going to join a very good college (I'm 18yo) that is very close to my house. They constantly keep telling me to ignore their fights as they don't want it to interfere with my studies. Both my parents have worked their asses off to make at least my life comfortable. But seeing them like this leaves with no motivation to do anything. I've always been a sort of a day dreamer who keeps imagining better times and then I feel terrible about it. I've been trying to deal with my own demons and problems too, like my extreme procrastination habit, my masturbation addiction, and my recent failure to meet expectations in an exam. Everyday the environment at home i just that of conflict.

Any advice for any of the three of us will be appreciated.

PS: Ever since the diagnosis my dad's business has crashed and we are struggling. So as far as possible pls refrain from suggesting therapy for all three of us as it will put more pressure on him. Also I cant inform them about my addiction as its a rather conservative household.

PS#2: I can convince them to go to therapy but can't afford telling them how I feel as it will break them. So any subs for me will also be appreciated. Also I need to know how to mediate any conflict that does arise as this entire situation is getting out of hand.

29,"I've given up on everything. I don't give a shit anymore.

All I want to do is live a life where nothing matters, I just want to fall asleep and dream forever. I just want to get away from everything. But that's not going to happen, is it? I'll try to talk to councillors at school, they have nothing to say. Medicare can't cover my psych costs for another month, and I can't even talk to my parents. It's always just, ""oh that's just being a teenager"". No, I don't think self harm and giving up on everything you used to love is normal. Don't have any friends, it's just me and myself. Everyone loves me at school though, I'm funny, laughing - but I go to the toilets before school and during the breaks to just sit in silence, alone and sometime to harm myself because I can't be bothered with life.

We live in a society where we have to hide our inner self and wear a pleasing mask all the time. Portray a perfect picture of life, filled with varied colors of a perfect family, successful career, and relationships. To live in the society is to survive all the hardships and yet manage to smile and the one who is able to do it effortlessly is the one who knows how to live, isn’t it?

How many times have you cried all night and the next morning you were back in the routine just like nothing happened? How many times you had a suicidal tendency just before you attended a dinner date? It is what goes inside a human mind a human body which everyone around fails to see, the scars, the impressions of some incidents are so deep that the pain becomes inevitable and the person starts finding solace in that pain. He starts searching for isolation, where he can be himself.

 

**Depression has no face, but depression is** **for** **REAL.** It is something which cannot be explained in words and felt or understood by everyone. The emotional turmoil, the feeling of disgust and frustration, anxiety, stress level, an individual goes through is very hard for him to experience and accept for himself at the first place, by the time the person understands what’s wrong with him, people around him makes his life more miserable by treating him in an inappropriate manner.

It could be the person you just saw laughing his heart out before you hear his tragic suicide. So what does depression look like, how do depressed people look like? How do we know if somebody has suicidal thoughts? When asked these questions many of us would probably imagine a crushed soul, crying shell of a person hiding in a pillow.

However, people who struggle with such feelings of depression try their best to hide their feelings in their daily lives. They just pretend normal but deep down inside they are screaming and yelling for help. They look like any other person walking down the street but if you try to hear between their words, read between the lines you might find that feeling of emptiness residing inside them.

The mood swings are such that the person doesn’t plan for suicide attempt it could just happen within a snap of time, over the slightest trigger. In one moment a lady could be kissing and admiring her newborn baby at the other moment she might feel like committing suicide. The fight is real, the struggle is real, this is perhaps the biggest fight anyone could fight with self, it is like me against myself, one part wants to live but the other one takes a toll over and over again.

## What causes Depression?

Depression is an extremely complex condition, there could be so many reasons to feel depressed or no reason at all, but its complexities are such that person feels overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness for no known reason. It could be due to some bad incident in the form of physical or emotional abuse, loss of dear ones or family history. Sometimes depression co-exists with a major illness or may be triggered by another medical condition.

## What could we do? How can we help someone?

We can certainly help our near and dear ones, by being a part of their struggle, it is time to speak up when you see an unusual behavior in the person, sleeping disorder, sudden mood shifts, change in eating habits or any behavioral change could be a matter of concern. **Don’t try to “fix” the person, just be a good listener.** This simple act of talking to someone face to face might help someone suffering from those feelings.

* By listening and understanding even the tiniest signs we can save lives.
* Do not take everyone at their ‘face’ value.
* If you think that somebody is showing some signs of depression, ask the hard questions before it’s too late, but have a very soft approach.
* Try to be there, be present
* Help them open up, take medical help if needed.

***I believe the bravest thing anyone could do is to fight for his own life and live each day with full strength and determination even if the thoughts of suicide or negativity crops inside every now and then.***

32,"Today I called the Suicide Prevention Hotline, and the operators was very rude. Her tone of voice made it seem like I was an inconvenience to her. And she kept on interrupting everything that I was saying with “Are you gonna kill yourself, or not? If not then hang up.” At this point I felt even worse than I had already felt. I decided to bring it up in a group chat on reddit. And one of the people there told me that they have a solution. That solution was a rope. He kept on telling me that my life won’t get any better, and if I end my life, it will end my pain. I know I shouldn’t be listening to him, but I’m actually starting to believe him.",22Jul2019,1
33,"I struggled with what I believe to be anorexia for years. I would starve myself every day and on one day every two weeks or so id eat a little bit of junk food. It went on for years getting worse but it went unnoticed because i wasnt ‘too skinny’. The whole time I struggled I was in ‘counselling’ with Child and Adolescent Mental Health services. They were awful. It took years of ME convincing THEM i needed help for my depression and anxiety. They dropped me in my first year because i hated going because of how upset they made me and then I had to go on the year long waiting list after that to get back into counselling. Turns out that they dropped me at age 12 even though they ‘suspected I had autism and adhd’ because they dropped me, during that year I did a lot of drugs and drank a lot. Before that though in the year/year and a half i was waiting to go back, I was still relatively ‘fine’. I was anorexic but I was still functioning (barely). This boy named Ben started talking to me, i had just fell out with a bunch of friends because they couldnt deal with my bad mental health so I talked to Ben like a friend, ben has an identical twin brother, they both were obsessed with me even though i expressed to them multiple times that I didnt like them like that. They would constantly try to hug me and touch me and be flirty with me in ways i didnt like. [This song](https://open.spotify.com/track/0qvzXomUDJVaUboy2wMfiS?si=umrf7VnvQ8GeR4rLocwoEg) is what Ben used to sing to me on facetime. He sang half the words wrong. He said it was ‘our song’ i didnt like that because its a love song and I wasnt interested i just wanted a friend. He used to encourage me to eat, one time in particular sticks out to me is when i wouldnt eat anything so he asked what I liked and got me a salad from subway. 

The main reason I struggle so much today is knowing that the guy who helped me get over my eating disorder is the same guy that raped me.

I remember I was in therapy whilst I was talking to him at the start then I stopped going. I remember one time going to school after therapy and him and his brother were signing into school late and he walked me all the way to my class even though it was the wrong direction.

We stopped being friends because one time when I was with his brother, another friend blackmailed me into kissing his brother by holding my phone and looking through all my messages (I talked about my mental health in the messages). Ben was so creepily obsessed with me that he thought he owned me and didnt realise that I was forced into doing what I didnt want to do.

6 months later whilst at a party he was there and we talked for a bit before he mentioned he still loved me and kept asking if I would kiss him. Him and his friend raped me that night because I said no.

The initial trauma actually kept me from reverting back to my eating disorder for a while. But the more I thought about it the more I realised that the guy who saved my life raped me.

I got back into therapy about 3 months later but I never talked about either my ED or my ptsd. 

Years later I finally come clean about the fact I was raped to my family. They seemed to be upset over that but they didnt care when I told them about my ongoing anorexia. Every time I mentioned it to my mother she would leave the room and slam the door. I told my therapist about the rape and she said ‘well i wont make you discuss that here you can discuss that at rasac (rape and sexual abuse center) which upset me but when I told her about my eating disorder she said ‘I wouldnt really consider that an eating disorder, i mean maybe disordered eating in a way *laughs*’

I am relapsing because of her words, because of the fact everyone who cared about me when I had an ED before all hurt me now, because of the fact my mother wont believe me and thinks Im a liar, she still locks all the junk food away so I cant eat it.

I am relapsing and theres nothing I can do.",22Jul2019,2

37,"This happened in the first week of January, so I dont need any advice or anything. This is just a personal story that I thought of sharing incase it made others happy or something. 

I hadnt thought about this for months, but I came across a post in Am I The Asshole, from a teacher about failing a student on the finals while the student dealt with a family death. so yeah. 

For backstory, my drama teacher knew about my mental illnesses since I had told him one day when I wasnt feeling up to presenting when I had secured my spot days prior. And, the day ny family was supposed to come back from the funeral, I had agreed to help my drama teacher and fellow classmates/club members with concessions for a basketball game. 

So, my grandpa (maternal) died on December 31st, 2018 (my paternal great-grandma died the same day years earlier, coincidence?). What my mom was told was that Papa was working in the garage, or was looking for something in there, and got shocked by one of the tools. My grandma (mom's stepmom) and aunt (who lives just down the road from them) rushed my Papa to the hospital, where they were told he had a heart atyack from the shock and was going into surgery to try and revive him. Clearly, it didnt work. 

My grandma (maternal) and mom started crying in the hallway outsode my door when they found out. When I left my room to find out what happened, I went back to my room. It didnt register in my head for a second. Then I went back to the haway to cry with my grandma and mom. Eventually they went into our garage to go calm down and smoke. I fell against the wall and started bawling my eyes out. My grandpa (mom's stepdad) headed to the garage to help my mom and grandma, and told me to go with him. 

Our New Year's Eve was spent packing for the roadtrip to Iowa, and we left the next morning at five a.m. 

So, while I still had cell reception, I sent my drama teacher an email, saying that there was a death recently in my family, and that I possibly wouldnt be able to help with concessions because of it. I sent this email around 5.30-6 ish, so that I could plenty of sleep on the drive. I didnt expect a response anytime soon, especially since it was winter holiday. 

Now, I was really excited about helping out with concessions, since I had done so with my mom at the college she works at many months prior, and because I figured it would help with my social anxiety. When we found out about my Papa, my mom told me it would be alright if i stayed home so i could help with concessions (and because this would be my first funeral). I had refused, and insisted upon going everytime someone told me i could stay home. 

The whole time, it never really registered in my head what dead people look like, what it would be like at a funeral, etc. Even though I had seen plenty of dead people on the shows I watch. So when we went to the funeral home, to make sure everything was alright and all that (idrk what happens at a funeral, like i said it was my first one), I didnt really go up to the casket, and my mom kept telling me I didnt have to go up if i didnt want to. Ten minutes before we left that day, I stood between the front rows of chairs and just stared at the body inside the casket. 

There was nothing wron with it, he looked the same as always (just a bit paler).I stood there because I thought something was wrong with me, why wasnt i crying like everyone else? this isnt even the funeral and everyone is crying like it is, except for me. So I just stared at his body. I couldnt barely bring myself to get any closer, but I did, to see if that would help. 

Being so close fucking broke me. He didnt look like him. Sure, it was his face and his body, and his clothes and his hair and everything. But it wasnt my papa. He was too pale. It looked like his skin was painted on with a lighter and more neutral shade of tan. He looked like he was just sleeping, a single poke into his arm and he wouldve been sitting up and cracking jokes. 

My mom called me away from the casket, since we were leaving and I tackled her into a hug. She hug me tight and was rubbing my back to comfort me, all while I was sobbing and sniffling loudly, snotting all over her jacket. My grandma and grandpa walked up (the ones we drove with) and my mom told them to take me outside so that I could breathe and get fresh air, so they did. Once we were outside, my sobbing got worse, and my grandpa asked what was wrong (because what else was he supposed to say?) And I just sobbed, saying that he looked like he was sleeping, like he could get up and be perfectly fine. 

This wasnt my grandpa's first rodeo, so he just talked me through it until I had stoppdd sobbing and only a few tears were rolling down my face. We eldt a few minutes later to go have dinner with my uncle and aunt and their two kids. 

Next day was the actual funeral. I didnt cry or anything, i had gotten it out the night before. When we went to the cemetery, I sat with my mom under the little tent while the put the casket in the ground next to my mom's stepbrother's grave (he died years prior, drunk, and stumbled upon a train track). My mom and I got weird looks because I was sitting there with her, it was because of my anxiety, there were a whole bunch of peopel that I didnt know and I didnt bring my medicine to the funeral, but nobody brought it up. 

On our way back to Colorado, I checked my email. My drama teacher had responded, saying that it was perfectly okay if i didnt make concessions due to the death and my mental health after the funeral. The basketball game the concessions was for was held on the day we came back (January 5th, almost one of my friends bdays). I dtayed home for a few minutes afyer we got back, before asking my grandma to take me to my school to help sith concessions. I walked into my school, and my drama teacher was surprised to see me. He gave me a simple smile and throughout the next hour/hour &amp; a half, he checked on me, asking if i was alright, if i needed a break or anything. It was really sweet, and changed my mindset about him completely. I had always liked my drama teacher, he wasnt afraid to tell it like it was which I respected, and this only made me respect him more. 

Throughput the rest of the schoolyear, he would check on me, see if i was doing alright, that sorta thing, and it made me respect him even more since none of my previous teachers or other teachers that year (that knew about my mental health) had done anything similar. 



While writing this, I cried twice. This was the second time I had cried about my papa ever since the funeral. The only other time was back in February or March when a couple guys from my school, which I met through a mutual friend, had brought up families and grandparents during a video call. I had to leave the call for awhile and when I came back, they didnt even ask me if I was okay or why I left the call. so yeah. 




I know that this became more about my papa's funeral than my teacher and that its quite a long post. But it is how it is. Like I mentioned before, Im not looking for advice or anything; this is just a personal story that I thought of sharing to make someone happy or something.",22Jul2019,3

And he kept on talking about wierd things in public and he was one of those guys who'd be like ""wheres my hug"" I HATE THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE SO MUCH.

after that i felt wierded out and told him i didnt feel comfortable with him and want to stop talking. BUT I WAS SO APOLOGETIC UGH.

Im in a lot of suffering right now because whenever I try to enjoy something thoughts of this guy come into my head and I start obsessing. I tried exposure for this thought but its not working.

40,So 2 years ago i was a pretty socially awkward 12 year old and I became tired. I was tired of all the bullshit life was throwing. No one seemed to care about me and i wanted to end all of it. I was pretty sad at my school people were started becoming concerned since I didn’t really socialize. I made a couple of acquaintances and tried to make myself seem to be fine and fit in. Everyday just brought more pain to me and i finally snapped It was January 2017 and I wanted to end all of it. So on January 14th i tried to overdose on Advil. When i slept that night i thought it would have been the end of it all.Surprisingly i woke up and that day changed my life forever. My aunt was planning to take my brother and i to her church that day and all i thought about was how my stomach hurt and how i had to throw up at least twice that morning. I went begrudgingly but found something there. I found people intrested in befriending me as we all played the same card game and we bonded over that. That helped me a little and helped my decision to keep going. Going there gave me an idea of what i could have missed out. After that week i decided to go again on my own will until i became a part of their church community. They gave me friends and a new will to live. Before that i was baptized(im a baptist) at 11 and stopped as i thought i made it. But going to that church saved me and while my faith sways they saved me. 2 years went by fast and instead of dying it gave me friends and a new perspective on life in general.,22Jul2019,3

42,"My name is Andrew (not my real name but close enough)

I am 21 years old, I live by myself, I am a soldier in the Australian Army. I enjoy rugby, playing the piano, drawing and playing 8 ball pool. 

I am also an alcoholic. There's not a night that goes by where I don't get drunk. When I try to stop drinking I get withdrawal symptoms and most often relapse after the slightest inconvenience. I smoke because I don't care about myself, infact there's nothing I hate more in this world than myself. I didn't have a good upbringing, not the worst bet definitely far from ideal. My father ran away when is was a kid and my mother was an alcoholic and neglectful. I was bullied in school and I've been in abusive relationships. I've never really had full control over my emotions. I have Persistent Depressive Disorder, an attachment disorder and borderline personality disorder. I see a psychologist on a monthly basis and I have a psychiatrist who I can see if I need help with medication or a change in treatment. A year ago I was on medication, sleeping pills and anti depressants. I tried to kill myself by swallowing all my meds and downing a bottle of rum in one night. When I woke up on my bathroom floor the next day I was numb and in shock that I was still alive. I'm no longer on medication because it conflicts with my job and wasn't working very well. I've broken peoples hearts and I've had my heart broken, neither have done me any favours. 

I have people I care about and that care about me. All my friends tell me that I'm the most loving, loyal and caring person they know. I don't disagree with them. For all the lack of love I have for myself, I make up for by loving other people. Caring about others distracts me from hating myself. I'll always put others before myself because I'll always believe that everyone and everything is worth more than me. I find an odd sense of comfort in not caring about myself. I find that when I'm alone and not trying to look after myself I get hurt less. I find the dull constant pain better than the inconsistent highs and the sharp excruciating lows that come with normal life. I take everything personally and find that everything that is wrong in my life is my fault because at least that way I feel I have some control over my life.

I feel fundamentally broken like a poorly written computer program that doesn't work properly. Part of me believes I can be fixed and part of me believes that I was born this way and there's no way to fix it. I've survived my whole life by doing the bare minimum and finding what little comfort I can in my sadness despite how unhealthy it may be. I'm fully aware of all my flaws and bad habits. I have little to no delusions about where my sadness comes from and what I do to fuel it. I don't like feeling this way, I want to change, I want to put in the effort into getting better. I know what I have to do and I have all the tools to do it but for some reason it just doesn't click. It's like I'm missing the last piece of the puzzle. Just one part of the equation is missing and I don't understand it. I should be able to fix myself but I can't for some reason. So for now I am a broken, alcoholic, depressed, soldier that hates himself more than anything and can't seem to fix myself.

The most extreme circumstances involved abusing my ex. Over time I realised the lack of empathy made my behavior awful (ie abuse), and I forced myself to keep it on at all times. By 17 or so, using it so frequently caused the option to turn it off to go away entirely.

**Effects of Social media on mental health**

I believe that social media has connected us with the rest of the world and also created a worldwide grid of people divided into three categories :-

1)    The ‘celebrities’

2)    The ‘ not so crazy ones’

3)    Normal people

* Believe it or not ,but this is the case in our communities especially among teenagers .Instagram recognizes an account as official if one has more than a 10K followers in their account which is quite impractical for a middle class chap . Still, A 14 yr adolescent would want as many likes and followers in their account as their fancy friend does .This leads to an unhealthy relationship between them,creating a non-friendly environment . Now this is just an example of negatives of social media,but this also has a great impact on one’s mental health .

 ***How social media?***

Social media is a common platform for teenagers to start suffering from mental health issues like depression, anxiety ,frustration etc. Here are some common methods to start going down this road:

&gt;1)    *Likes,followers*: Getting less than 50 likes on a post and not reaching more than a 100 followers is very common phenomenon among users and this is when they try altering their looks, perform stupid dares on social media and what-not.  
2)    *Cyberbullying :*Texts from strangers  , classmates or bullies at school can harm your mental health .They will criticize your appearances, force you to challenge yourselves in unimaginable ways ,deepen your sorrows and some sadists can even break you from inside-emotionally ofcourse .

* Each and every person suffers from mental health issues at some point. Wise is one, who recognizes these changes and takes action. So, step up , visit a counsellor , psychologist or a therapist because if you take your mental health for granted  ,you are right on track to tread a path filled with depression, anxiety, fear and despair. 

***“Your social skills in the real world are threatened, relations-damaged and all you are worried about are likes on a photo you posted out of desperation. Talking to strangers on social media rather than friends who were there for you when you needed them .”***",22Jul2019,0
51,"I've been recovering from a trauma related breakdown for three years (and doing much better than I was thankfully). Some friend have tried to help out as much as they can but I could tell they didn't understand the severity of what I was going through. For example, encouraging me to get back to work when I could barely get out of bed and leaving me having a panic attack like I was just being dramatic. 

Fast forward and life has thrown shit at them which means they now get anxious or depressed when under severe stress, like most people would. But now they are saying they totally understand what's going on with me and we're all in the same boat. 

When I first told them I was suicidal their response was 'everyone feels that way sometimes, not a big deal'. But as soon as one of them briefly felt that way we were all round making sure they were okay. 

So now they understand more but I feel like they are shaming me even more because I can't just perk up and get on with things again like they do. The other day one of them said 'at least we don't have cancer, that puts our problems in perspective'. Way to intensify the self loathing! But at the same time stood me up without getting in touch at all when we had arranged to meet. They don't seem to feel the need to apologise about it because they were having a panicky morning so I (of all people) should understand and not be bothered. I would never leave them hanging like that though :/

I don't know if I'm overreacting or being a complete bitch. But some of my friends are making me feel awful even though I know they don't mean to. Any advice?",22Jul2019,1
52,"Hi everyone!

My bf and I have been in a LDR for 1.5 years now. It was long-distance from the beginning, we're both pretty busy people so we have similar schedules, and started to go see each other every 2 weeks. 

For about half a year now, we happen to hang out with other people during our weekends more and more. Last week we were in a different city where he has three girl friends. We met all of them, I already knew one of them, and one was the reason for the trip to that city as we was getting married. 

Whenever we hang out with other people I get very aware of what's going on ""intersocially"" and I'm not quite sure to which extent I should tell him about these things.

Two examples:   
1. when we were at the one friend's wedding, there was a photo booth. He managed to get the bride (his friend) for a quick shoot there and I offered them they could have a photo of just the two of them so that I would stand back. His friend immediately denied and said ""You belong to him now, of course you're coming on the photo!"" and I really appreciated that. In retrospect I was disappointed/anxious though because it had been her saying it, not my bf.

2. we met one of his friends for coffee. Sat down at a table. I sat down first, he sat down next to me, his friend sat down opposite of him. Just him. At some point they had a long-ish conversation between just the two of them and suddenly I couldn't stop thinking how I was completely ""unnecessary"" there, because if I had turned invisible all of a sudden, it would just have been them sitting exactly opposite each other. I was kind of left to the side.

Both are situations that I know I notice because of social anxiety and a heightened sense for questioning other people's motives, but I don't know how to deal with it. Do I tell my bf about how I felt in these situations or do I just book it under ""it's your mental illness, deal with it""? He has been very receptive in the past, but also admitted to feeling pressure not to trigger me and becoming insecure in how to act with other people because he never knows what might set me off. 

I don't want to pressure him, but I also know my emotions are generally valid, but I ALSO know that some emotions are just mental illness speaking...",22Jul2019,1
53,"I found [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057447) that shows some promising results:

""Meta-analyses of RCTs of iCBT for depression have demonstrated moderate effect sizes that provide evidence that iCBT can be comparable to best-practice face-to-face CBT"".

&amp;#x200B;

It's 7 years since the study was done so I was wondering if there's much advice that's up-to-date and easy for laypeople to sort through the options.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I found on the blogosphere:

* [The Best Depression Apps of 2019](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/top-iphone-android-apps)
* [The top 10 mental health apps](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320557.php)
* [5 Tips For Comparing Depression Apps](https://blog.uplift.app/5-tips-for-starting-a-depression-app-today)

&amp;#x200B;

Those articles and some App Store searching led me to this list of ones that seem like they might(?) provide comparable results to those mentioned in the study:

* Depression CBT by Excel At Life (looked out of date, couldn't find a website or iPhone version)
* Happify
* Moodnotes
* Moodpath
* Sanvello (formerly Pacifica)
* This Way Up
* UpLift
* Wysa

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to turn in for the night, has anyone had experience with these? Have any better suggestions for how to decide before committing the time (and in some cases money)?

54,"This is something that have helped me alot during many years of drug addiction and even more years of depression and anxiety. Our eyes does not only work as cameras, but they also work as a projector. The eyes see the image or event and sends signals to your brain, which then process it and out goes the experience. 
In other words whatever happens you can always affect how you want to experience and percieve it, as long as you know that you can.
This doesn't mean that you can make a traumatic event into a wonderful experience, but you can make a conscious decision to focus on another point of view that's less painful to bear with.

62,"Hi all, 

I would like some opinions on what my mental health problems are.

First off I want to say that since I was younger I had this vivid imagination, so much so that it pulled me out of my surroundings. For example the teacher would be speaking in school and I would be constantly daydreaming. Was often described as a rogue and had some behavioral problems.

The closest I can gather is adhd, although that doesn’t quite seem enough. I also thought possibly Aspergers but also doesn’t seem like it. I don’t really have any difficulty understanding people, just don’t seem to care as much as other kids. 

Now flash forward to in my early twenties (I am 25 years old and male I should mention) and my mental heath isn’t good. I am constantly thinking and not focusing on my surroundings. Thinking about life in an existential way over and over and not motivated to do anything productive, goals etc.

I feel as though i am alone and nobody understands me, this has caused me to isolate myself and slip on a mask when I do talk to people. The worst part is people seem to notice in disturbed at times at work which is stressful and making things worse.

I have been to doctors but as I live in Ireland mental health support is limited at best .

I know that’s a concise description but if anyone has any idea or input either from first or second hand experience what I’m describing then I would appreciate any help..

My mom told me her sister got sexually abused by their dad, my mom said she wasn't part of that and that he never touched her. My mom's dad got divorced when my mom was about 7 and her abused sisters where around 9 and 11ish. I heard this story a lot and never reallt thought about it, as my mom's dad and her sisters passed away. But lately I've been putting things more in perspective. 

I grew up with just my mom, she was my best friend and always played with me. I loved Barbie dolls and we made up stories together. A couple of those stories contained pretty heavy stuff like rape and abuse (theres a link I think). 
She even went as far as giving the babies genitals, my mom (and myself) are very creative  so she was pretty good at manipulating Barbie dolls. So because of this got in contact with sex and abuse at a very young age, around 8/9 I think, as far as I know my mom never really touched me inappropriate. And it was years later that I realized that her behavior was off. (Im an only child with no other children in my family, as most of my family is dead). 

Im not sure what I want, maybe a bit of advice or opinions on what happened. If my mom might be  sexually abused or if this is a reaction of her sisters telling her of the abuse.

I took it at 600 mg per day for about a year and it helped me be able to do a lot of things with less anxiety. I tapered off and had withdrawals all 4 month I was off of it. Not terrible but worse anxiety than before I started it. I went back on and I’ve been back on a few months now. It doesn’t really do much and I feel more depressed. I even wake up depressed before my morning dose kicks in. I’m so sick of all this, I feel like killing myself every day and I live an easy life in a high class family.

Pretty much what the title says. 
I'm tired of people telling me it's gonna get better. I know it will. Until it gets bad again. It comes in waves and that's the most exausting part, I feel powerless to get them under control. I'm tired of therapy (can't afford it anymore either), tired of all the labels (I have yet to find one that fits my mental state).

I’ve fended for myself my entire life, previous job allowed me to get a place of my own outside of the foster care I was in, had to leave due to the store closing down.

I dont Know if this is the rigth Place to ask or write this, if anyone has another subreddit or forums that are more appropriate for this,please link.

I have ruined everything for myself and i Am now ruining the lives of the only people Who care about me. I have the kindest parentes and two beautfull younger Sisters, that has been cursed With me as a big Brother.  I think i do more damage staying at home and being around them than if i Just get going.

I have been depressed since 25 of april this year, so soon to be the 3month mark, quarter of a year. I have not been diagnosed, but have talked to the doctor Who isnt really taking anything serriously. What could she Even do, i did all this myself and have to fix it, but here is what is causing the depression. I think i have ruined my brain and hearth to the point of No return. The person i was supposed to be im No longer. I went from being an ambitius, kind, Maybe funny, talkative and decent smart, to a complete joke of a meme within two years. 

From the age of 20 to now 22 i have been a complete degenrate. Started With alot of partying, then alot of weed With friends, and the last year alot of weed With myself, because i became anxious and paranoid smoking With alot of people. I went from being talkative to not saying anything, probably some mental disorder and some wrong fireings in the brain. Instead of stopping the smoking i rather started smoking for myself at night. Watching YouTube, Netflix, conspiracys, playing video games and fapping. Alot of fapping. 

I stopped smoking the 25 of mars. In the first i felt faster, less foggy and ready for learning the Maths ive been failing for a couple of times, but a month after i got a 3 Day Long anxiety attack, that felt like the end of the world. After this my life has been a total falling card house, into a downward spiral of hell. 

Feeling stupid as fuck every situation of every day. Like i lost it completely. Ptsd and flashbacks from the Dumb things ive done. I hasitate and overthink situations so much that i fuck up the thing happening in present time, by the default that my brain is stuck in my last failure. Might be a month old failure or an event taking Place 30min earlier where i have Just done something ridicolous strange. Like say goodbye to a colleague, but instead of smiling i have this open gaced weird look in my face. So i have to look in the mirror and ask myself, how stupid do i look when i do that instead of a normal smile. And it is, indeed the most stupid looking face i can imgagine. Like i can see my lost soul. 

So now i understand why everyone has stopped looking at me With normal eyes and With smiles, they relfect back the hopelessness i give Out. 

I want to become normal, fix this shit. Be able to connect With people again, stop being an incel and get a degree in something. Get the funn back in life, but every minute of every day is pure hell. I Am depressed to the point i drag the people around me down in my depression it feels like, and it Just makes it Even worse.",22Jul2019,2

88,"First time poster here, so bear with me. I get my results in less than an hour. I have been diagnosed with anxiety for 5 years and recovered depression freshman year of college (5 years ago). My academic and social experience makes me feel like the ADHD diagnosis fits and my therapist agreed it required investigating. My last psych wanted to diagnose me with bipolar without going through actual testing (which I guess is a major differential for ADHD and I refused because my mood is stagnant). I've been to counseling for the past 6 years, with 2- one year breaks. I'm on effexor 75 mg, and have been for a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to prepare for the worst case scenario of a negative result. At this point I'm not sure what to do if it's negative because I feel like I'm going to fail at work (going into my 3rd year as a pharmacy student, so future pharmacist) and my overall health and social relationships are starting to crumble. As a pharmacy intern, I already fail at staying focused at entering scripts and getting things done because I get busy with something else and just forget the other things I have to do. I'm really scared, and I'm not sure what there is to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Worst of all, I have put $450 toward help/diagnosis and I don't have anymore money to go towards counseling at this top tier facility. My only option is to go back to the psych, that tried to diagnose me with bipolar, that is free through my school.",22Jul2019,1

93,"I’ve been dealing with some mental illness for a while. To be completely honest, all of it came from trying to be someone that I wasn’t. It all starts back in middle school, late middle school to be exact. I remember acting different to impress people, acting really different, but people loved it so I went with that instead of just being the REAL me. I remember it started then, being in that ego inflated headspace. Of course, at this time everything was going good, even though a part of me knew that it could go south at any time. This continued in high school, especially whenever I moved in the 10th grade to another school. I really tried to fit in with some people and again, I just wasn’t being me. A lot of people looked at me as a humble guy, but in my head I was judge mental and egotistical.  I remember one day I went to this place where people were supposed to be boxing, like a soccer field,  and someone asks me to fight this guy that was weaker than me. What happened in my head, was, I realized that he was weaker than me, and that I could win, I thought of the reward (winning the fight, making myself look better) and I said that I would do it. Even this guy told me to go easy on him, because it really wasn’t a fair fight. Instead of listening to him I shrugged it off and looked at it as another weakness. So we fight, and this guy actually wins. He did really good. I’m sure that karma (and my poor skills) had a lot to do with me losing. I remember going home that day and feeling really depressed, empty. This was the first time that I can remember, where things really started to go wrong. This one fight changed my ego, and the way that I carried myself in school, I knew that people would not respect me as much, so now I was more quiet, I felt ashamed on the inside. Like I couldn’t be respected because who knows when someone will say something, or really just what they are thinking. I have no room to talk. Time goes on and this definitely fades, but then I end up in a bad situation where someone was spreading rumors that I was a snitch. This, was never true and I found out later that it was someone just trying to ruin my name. But either way, when all of this was happening, people made it seem like the guy that I fought was saying this. So I called him, and we had a pretty heated convo. We then end up fighting a month or so after, whenever we saw each other. And here as well, I was driven by ego. We fought, and I lost pretty badly. I was really ashamed. I remember going home this time and just having nothing in me, just being so depressed and numb. After all of this I had no more self confidence in school, I knew that I wasn’t worthy of it. So I stopped talking to most people, I felt ashamed. I stopped going outside for lunch, I didn’t want to show my face. This lasted for at least 7 months, it was a really dark time of my life. After I graduated (i’m in 12th at this time), I had no friends. I was just at my house alone, with only my thoughts. I felt so much shame, depression, emptiness, stress, around this time of my life. Some of it is still with me til this day. This was all a result of ego backlash. I loved when people gave me good judgement, but it wasn’t long before I had a lot of bad judgement and it left me feeling empty. I’m glad that this happened though, because I was an idiot, and really who knows how else it could’ve ended.  But now, I have to deal with the aftermath, which is essentially not caring about the good or bad from these people. Not accepting their love, and praise, for being someone that I am not. And not accepting their hate and disapproval, for being someone that I am not. It’s about letting go of all of it, realizing that I was being an egotistical idiot, and now I need to be the real me. 

I’ve realized this, and have slowly been making progress, I just want to know, do any of you guys know if MDMA helps with this? My goal is to become less less judge-mental, less egotistical, and just to be myself. To realize that I’ve been an idiot in the past, but to change who I am now. If any of you have had experience with mdma, please let me know if it could help with my situation. I just want to be me, and get past all of egotistic shit that I was once a part of",22Jul2019,1

 This last month has been really tough for me (the obvious depression and anxiety here). But I have been really struggling with my self image and haven't been eating a lot recently. I'm not crazy thin or anorexic. I lost almost a stone in about a week or so which I was super happy about but put it back on quickly as I don't leave the house and eating stops me being bored I guess. I don't eat too much but it's so infuriating to me that I put the weight back on.

But the problem for me is that I just can't get over the food guilt. It's for everything: meals, snacks, even the smallest amount of food ingested makes me feel so guilty and shitty about myself. I have been really considering resorting to making myself throw up and I tried once but I guess I have low gag reflexes or something. 

I just cannot cope with how bad it makes me feel when I eat. I feel like dying, I feel worthless, I cry and cry etc.  I often say to myself in the morning ""I'm not going to eat until supper"" but end up eating anyway and just hating myself more for the rest of the day. 

Does anyone have any coping mechanisms for it? I just can't stop myself from beating myself up about anything anymore. Thanks for reading :\^^())  Sorry if this is super depressing haha",22Jul2019,2
99,"   My reason for exercise has been misguided the past few years because of nicotine and vaping. A lot of things in my life have been misquided due to nicotine.  The nicotine drains my dopamine leading me to find other ways to get that dopamine fix. It ignites a dopamine feinding mindset. A mindset that will develop healthy and optimistic goals that are really just disguised methods of attaining the beloved dopamine fix. 
   Looking back, i always get nic in my system before i work out. And i always work out because im in search of something more. After nicotine fasting for 4 days and then hitting the vape i finally understand. 
   Nicotine is evil. It rewires your brain to think in terms of dopamine and pleasure. ""You should always be happy""  ""you should only eat food thag makes you feel good"" ""if your not happy just smome more nicotine, if that doesnt work maybe drink or smome weed or hang out with people""
   Its a fallacy. 
   It creates an anxious, selfish mind. The opposite of inner peace. It tricks you into thinking this way is the only way to  better your mind and mental health. You wont be happy without it.
   Over these last 4 days ive been uncomfortable, butthurt, and depressed, but after ingesting the nic i feel the same way but with added nervousness anxiety restlessness and an added sense of accomplishment. ""I got dopamine i did something good"" 
    Maybe nicotine wakes you up from the dopamine skirmish by actually GIVING YOU CONTROL over your releases in order to focus on more fulfilling tasks. Perhaps this is why artist historically smoke and every hipster vape god has deep repressed fellings of anguish and is constantly overanalyzing life. 
   I dont think people who are addicted to anything have a true grip on reality. Quit all addictions before seekimg any kind if professional help.

109,"I was diagnosed with social anxiety earlier this year but I’m starting to think my mental health issues go way beyond that. Since getting help I no longer feel the same anxiety about social situations but that hasn’t meant I’ve gotten rid of the anxious feelings about other things, mainly school work. I realize that a lot of people might feel some anxiety around big projects but I doubt it is to this level. I feel a pressure in my chest, feel nauseous, can’t sleep, fight-or-flight kicks in and sometimes I start to think about how the easiest way to get away from it is to commit suicide. Not in a way that I think I would actually do it but I still get the thought of how easy it would be if I were to die. I sometimes get these thoughts multiple times a day. Other than that the anxiety is paralyzing and I pretty much lock down. At the same time I’m a bit scared about what would happen if I tried to get help as well as unsure of where to turn (live in Sweden).",22Jul2019,1
110,"Hey guys, I starting working on an app last night after a severe panic attack and would your feedback. Additionally, if you know of any similar apps that already exist that you're using I'd love to hear about them. This app would allow you to register and select your condition(s), anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, ocd, etc... When you're having a really tough time, you can go on the app and it will connect you one on one in a chat with a few different people (anonymous) that also suffer from your same condition(s) so you can explain what you're going through and they can help you through it. My passion for this stems from being able to help others with mental illness when they are suffering and also to give others an easy way to connect with someone with their same condition. I have roommates right now and they are kind and respectful, but none of them really understand what it's like to live with mental illness. Sometimes when my panic attacks are really bad, I want to talk to someone that fully understands what it's like. If you have time, I'd love to know your thoughts! Thank you",22Jul2019,1
111,"Hi all,
As the title states, I have resentment towards my parents, and while I like to downplay it when I talk to people about it, I know deep down it's a tremendous amount of resentment. I had a unique childhood full of unfortunate events. I have subconsciously blocked out memories from before I was 10 because of this. Growing up, I witnessed my parents arguing non-stop. Every day they'd be near eachother, I remember being scared to death they'd start something with eachother. I've witnessed my mom get physical with my dad countless times, anywhere from throwing picture frames, taunting him with vases, and even tackling him to the ground with this huge glass vase to which my brother (10 at the time) and I (6) had to try to pull her away. She was also physical towards me my entire life. She spanked me when I was a child and punched me until I bled as a teenager. 

I never saw them loving eachother growing up, it was just simply arguing. No kissing, no hugs, it was as if they were just friends. When I was 15, I was having an extremely rough year being bullied on my volleyball team and one day at practice, my mom found out my dad cheated on her with her friend. This led to a PLETHORA of arguments that lasted for at least an entire year. I saw my moms last desperate attempt to ""try to be a better wife"" before my dad told her he was moving on once again. Shortly after that, my dad moved in with his girlfriend in a house just down the street from our original house. I had to sit and watch him slowly pack up his things and leave. Before all this, we were extremely close due to him being heavily invested in my volleyball career, and it seemed to just disintegrate in a second because of this. 

Shortly after this, my mom found a boyfriend and started spending a lot of time with him. She'd be out for days at a time and leave me home alone for days and be completely fine with doing so. Everytime i'd tell either of them I wish they'd be home more, they would snap at me and say I needed to be out with friends, and if I was, I wouldnt be feeling this way. This especially, I grew extremely angry towards because growing up, I wanted nothing more than to be close to my parents and hang out with them, and they seemed to turn away from the idea and abandon me. 

I've expressed my resentment towards my parents and i've gotten nowhere. My mom says I deserve the physical beatings I got, my dad sees no wrongs in what he did either. They say i'm wrong for having resentment because they ""bought me everything I wanted growing up."" My family was on the wealthy side, and for my whole life, I was baught nice gifts which, while I was thankful and fortunate for, I wish hadn't been used as a counterargument for their wrongdoings. 

Fast forward to today, I dont live with them anymore, as i'm 19. But everyday I struggle to block bad memories of my childhood. I have dreams about my mom beating me, I have severe abandonment issues over the littlest things. I just have an overwhelming amount of resentment that is keeping my depression of several years from getting better. It's angering and it's heartbreaking to look back on. Theres nothing more I wanted then a close, tight knit family. Looking back just breaks my heart. Don't get me wrong, my family and I had a lot of good moments. Sometimes I just cant shake this feeling that maybe this was more than just an average childhood like my parents taught me to believe. Any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for reading this.",22Jul2019,7

116,"Long story short, I am a 21F with BPD, self destructive behavior, and intense emotions. Things that do not logically make me angry set me off rapidly in the blink of a second and I calm down just as fast as I got mad. During these quick bursts of random emotion, Its so intense that it's the worst emotion ever and I can not describe it in words. I do things I wouldn't do, and it feels like I have absolutely no control. 

For example, 10 minutes ago I got angry and snapped and grabbed a knife and cut myself deeply. Immediately after I cut my self my anger turned into intense fear of myself and my cut, because I didn't choose to cut myself. It's like my body just did it. This literally happened in a 5 second span.  

I am absolutely terrified that I am going to kill myself when one of these episodes happens, I've explained this to therapists/psychiatrists and they don't seem to take it seriously . But I am LITERALLY losing control of my mind and it's scary.

My dad passed away in February and I have been really struggling. I have a technical job in IT but have been having trouble concentrating and I have noticed that during meetings I need to write everything down now because I am struggling to hold on to information. It's like I'm hearing what people say, and I understand it, but it's in one ear and out of the other.

I've been struggling to sleep and have only been getting around 4-5 hours each night on a weekday so I'm always exhausted and my weekends are spent catching up on the sleep I didn't get during the week.

I made an appointment to speak to my GP to see if there's anything I can get to help me. She asked me if I am suicidal, and I said no. They referred me to a bereavement councillor and they told me to get some lavender essential oils to help me sleep (aren't essential oils part of those MLM scams???)

I called the bereavement councillor and there was no answer so I left a voicemail. They called me back to get some information and said they would contact me with an appointment to speak to them - this was over 2 weeks ago so I think they've forgotten about me.

121,"Hey guys. Fairly new user here so if I posted this in the wrong area or subreddit or whatever it’s called, I apologize !! I still don’t exactly know how this works.

Anyways, I’ve always had a weird relationship with food. I used to be an overweight child and preteen due to my over consumption and hatred of physical activity. But after 9th grade (currently about to be a senior in high school), I started going to the gym. I currently am 5’3 and 118 lbs, and I have no muscle despite the fact i’ve really been trying lol. But anyways I am the type of person who is constantly hungry and always trying to hold myself back from snacking. If I eat bad I panic especially if I can’t work out afterwards. I don’t have an eating disorder but it has just come to the point where i’m so concerned about my food consumption that it’s all I can focus on in the day. I always have a big appetite so cutting down on foods is hard for me. But two days ago I ate nothing but watermelon (literally like half of it), blueberries, bananas, and one bowl of corn flakes. Then I went to the gym afterwards.  The next day I ate a 12 inch tuna sub and went to the gym as well because I was so anxious that I gained weight that I couldn’t focus and i am still mentally beating myself up over it. Today I ate watermelon, a cup of dried cheerios, and apples. I thought I was doing good but my mom made tacos for dinner and I ate four of them. FOUR of them and now i’m terrified that i’m just gaining weight and it’s to the point where I’ve downloaded a calorie tracking app and i’m just so so so frustrated over it. I still eat fruit all the time but if I eat anything else I feel so disgusted with myself. I have to hold myself back from eating until dinner comes and I actually eat a full meal and regret it all. Do you know how to get a healthier mindset regarding food consumption? This is a fairly prominent problem i’ve been having for a while in on and off phases and i’m worried that it could get worse in the long term future",22Jul2019,1
122,"Context; I use to have crippling depression I got help around 2 years back and my life turned around after that for the better. The things i suffer are depressive disorder(multiple diagnoses), mood disorder, anxiety disorder, trauma, mild PTSD and ADHD, I'm also under observation for other possible problems. I started taking meds and I'm seeing a therapist 4 times a month and a psych once to twice a month. I have energy now, motivation, I'm active and able to do anything I put my mind to, depression is close to non-existent as well as my anxiety. But my suicidal thoughts have never subsided, I constantly obsess with suicide wanting to die. I hate it, it's the one thing about me I want to go away the most. Sometimes I get scared that I'll cave.

So I wonder will I always be like this? Or if I achieve where I want to be in life will it finally stopped? Or will I have mostly everything I want and still want to die? 

Has anyone here with suicidal ideation overcame their mental health issues and went on to have successful lives? Do you still obsess over suicide? Do you have any advice?

123,"So I (f,27) grew up with my cousin (m,24). Despite how close we were growing up, he was incredibly close to his mum. He was a true mummy’s boy. However, once he turned about 10/11 his mum got married to a complete prick who the family collectively hated. During their marriage he completely changed, became so isolated and this warm friendly boy became mean, rude and manipulative. Eventually my aunt and her husband split up but the relationship between my aunt and my cousin has remained on tatters.

That’s a background of what I think may possibly explain his present behaviour? I worry that my cousin may be suffering from some kind of mental health issue, possibly a personality disorder. I now live with my aunt and cousin and have noticed strange behaved which has shocked me. In the past he would leave home at 2am to go for walks dressed completely on black. This stopped for a while but last night he did the same thing. He left around 2 and came back around 3:30am. My aunt who is incredibly scared, asked him and he said he went to McDonald’s??? He doesn’t have a car and busses stop in my areas around 12. So he would be walking for at least an hour there.

I’ve also accidentally walked in on him when it was pitch black...and he was dancing. No music playing just dancing. It was really a strange. He is very aggressive to his mum but very pleasant to other people, charming in some ways. Like if you never lived with him you wouldn’t imagine that he would have strange behaviours. He can also be quite manipulative and rude.

125,"So for reasons I wont expand on, I've recently started self defence classes again and I have zero interest in chit chat or socialising. I feel like the people I train with arent the kind of people I would ever usually socialise with (despite the fact I know nothing about them apart from one hobby they have).

Despite the fact I've recognised myself shutting these people out and consciously working to maintain that, I'm genuinely fine with this. The reason for posting here though is for some reason I can't help but feel weak and vulnerable.

While typing this I'm coming to the realisation that I'm essentially contradicting myself:

 - I want to be pushed outside my comfort zone, but on my terms and in my own time.
 - Despite going into it knowing I'd have to relearn basics, upon reflection i can see i was tough on myself for slipping on basic techniques that I wasnt paying full attention to.
 - I found myself silently disagreeing with the coach (who obviously knows more than me) which suggests to me an internal conflict of some sort. Probably the tough expectations I set myself.
 - I left angrier than when I arrived, when part of the purpose is to help me channel my anger and frustration during training.
 - I'm aware that my humanity means I'm not perfect and wont get something new right the first time, yet I can't help become frustrated and annoyed when I'm given tips on how to improve.

I avoided eye contact as much as possible, at the end of the class I got dressed and headed straight for the door saying nothing but a short ""thank you"" to the receptionist. I found myself annoyed when probed with follow up questions about how my first night went. Essentially I couldn't wait to get out of there and even found myself paying close attention to the clock on the wall. Although I had physically warmed up, perhaps I hadn't mentally warmed up...

At this point in time I'm not prepared to share any of this with anyone I train with. That's non-negotiable at the moment. In my mind this is me protecting myself and I'm happy with the wall I've built. But part of me also recognises that maybe this is the one place I can let me guard down, feel vulnerable and be OK. I just don't know if I have the strength to knock down this wall I've spent so long building.",22Jul2019,1

131,"This blog becomes difficult to type here and there for a few reasons. First is because I have terrible ADHD and can barely finish a train of thought before I become distracted and go onto another topic, it will also be seen in my writing structure and I may jump from point to point. The second, and main reason, is because of my desire to remain unanimous and not have my character or being represent the topics I want shed light on.  As I discuss and illustrate more of my story it will become easier to put the puzzle pieces together and figure out who I am, but we will deal with that when we get there. For now it is tough to figure out what to say without revealing who I am, again by hiding myself it will allow me to draw attention to bigger and more important topics.

At last let us get into some of the finer details of my life. My gender is irrelevant but the details you should know will be revealed in due time. The first detail you should know is that I am half black and half white, my black side is Caribbean and my father is my Black Parent. On the other hand my mum is from England and is a ginger, so yes she has no soul. However the unique circumstances of how my parents met and what happened immediately after I was born will be discussed, and the picture will begin to be painted to show you an individual who has suffered a lifetime of mental health issues, and has also been subject to conflicting personalities as well as minimizing my true needs. Again this will be exemplified throughout the entirety of my personal story, so just bare with me.

What I will make clear is that I was an accident-child and I have always known this, and even to this day I am constantly being reminded by it. Some people in the world knowing this fact may throw them off, or just demolish the entirety of their being… “My parents didn’t want me,”… you know how it goes. But for some reason growing up that thought never occurred to me, my mum provided me with everything I needed and ensured I had more than enough love to make up for the two of them. O yes, my parents were never married or “together” in the technical sense so there you have it, I am a bastard (or at least it felt like that way growing up). Being honest here, the train of thought “my parents didn’t want me” never passed through my conscious thoughts; to me it was what it was. The reason for this is actually quite sad, it has become so normalized in Western society for the Black man to not be present in their children’s lives that it is not even an often discussed topic. Is it not screwed up that individuals of other cultures are ‘surprised’ when they hear that a black father was present in the entirety of their offspring’s lives? Now I do not know if this is racism or oppression, but what I can tell you it is sad that we as a culture have this stigma.

This normalization in society can lead to bullying, or a lack of confidence for the child. If you have not noticed I haven’t even mentioned the negative mental impact this has on the child when there is no father-figure present, or more specifically their biological parents. It is funny though that my story begins with my father not being present, as I honestly believe that I am a better man and person because of the trauma that I have been through and seen. Overall, when a child is born and is not submersed in their applicable cultures it can lead to long term negative impacts. Such as me still not knowing who I am, as it has only been recent that I have begun to become more knowledgeable about my black culture and have become more comfortable being black as I am indulging in the environment more. But I really do not look full black, so I truly do not fit in individuals who are full of their melanin. On the other hand you have a child who looks ‘black’ being raised in a white environment where their needs and perspectives on life rarely correlate with mine (white privilege).

For now you know that I am half white and half black, my father was not present, and I do not know who I am. Let me leave you with this thought; are we not all human and if so why do I have to associate with a particular culture? Shouldn’t being multicultural be praised?

That question will hopefully one day be answered but that’s all I have for today.

135,"TL:DR I feel like I am trying to convince myself that I am crazy even though I am not, and I don't want to get ""professional"" help because I know a diagnosis of anything would be wrong (because I am lying to myself about the symptoms) and would only destroy my ability to have an independent life.  Can I be hospitalized against my will if I'm suspected of losing touch with reality?  Is there any other ways I can fix my mind? 

I've been trying to write this out for almost a week now and every time I do I can't finish it or it is too long or I look over it and don't agree with anything I say.  I feel like I can't trust my own mind right now.  I started experiencing hallucinations in high school, things like my name being yelled or seeing animals darting around the floor.  I also had these ""visions"", I would see myself doing something violent or taboo, and they felt so real I was terrified that one day I would accidentally act on them.  They mostly reduced in intensity over time, but were replaced by ""voices"".  It's not like external voices, I know they are parts of me in my own mind parallel to my actual self, but they are almost always there, telling me to do bad things, or that I should hurt or kill myself, or telling me how I am worthless and disgusting.  And the phrases repeat in my head over and over getting more and more loud until I feel myself saying them out loud and I don't know if they are actually part of me or something else.  

Over a month ago things started getting a lot worse, my thoughts would spiral and I started feeling like I was losing control.  I don't know what thoughts are my own or if I can trust all my memories anymore.  I feel terrified that I am losing my mind, but I don't know what is wrong with me or how I can fix it.  I am lucid and in control, which makes me feel like I am faking this whole thing, like I am lying to myself about what I am experiencing.  I started remembering events from my childhood and realized that they might be considered abusive, but another part of me thinks I'm being overly sensitive and misremembering / cherry picking events to make a sob story.  I don't know if the insects and animals I see moving around are hallucinations or just a trick of the light and I am convincing myself it's all in my head.  Or if the creatures crawling on my skin and burrowing in my ears are just an itch or something worse.  I know I am in control, and that the bad thoughts are part of my mind and I must be allowing them to happen on purpose but I don't know why.  It's making me feel sick to my stomach, I can barely sleep, it feels like I am falling apart but I am doing it to myself because I'm not actually crazy.  

I don't know what to do or who to talk to, I feel totally isolated.  I can't talk to my family, they will just use it as ammunition against me, I can't talk to my coworkers, I don't want to use an imaginary condition as an excuse for not doing work and I don't want to get fired.  I tried talking to my friends but I don't want to push them away and they can't understand what I try to tell them.  I don't post online because I am so conflicted on what I am experiencing it is hard to write out, and I know the response will always be some regurgitated line about ""it gets better"" or ""dm if you want to talk"" or ""here is a list of suicide prevention hotlines"" or ""go to get professional help"" or any of the other empty lines people parrot.  I will never talk to a so called ""professional"".  I can't explain how I feel without sounding like a psycho.  They may brush it off and tell me what I already know, that I am faking this all in my head for attention.  Even worse is the alternative, that they take it seriously.  

If they believe that I am actually crazy (which I'm not) or that I am a threat to myself or others because of the urges or the ""voices"" (I'm disgusted by suicide, and I'm still in control), then they will lock me up.  They will brand me with a ""diagnosis"" and toss me in with the rest of the actually insane people and they will inject me and drug me and convince me and everyone else that I am not able to be independent, so they can rob me of my personality and monitor me to make sure I can never be free and they will use their pills and ""therapy"" to control my mind and turn me into one of their puppets that parrot the same lines over and over about how you should go and admit your thought crimes to the puppetmakers so they can take you in and reprogram you because you've seen through their thinly veiled lies and are a threat to their plans.  I won't let them take me, it is a fate worse than death.  

I know that sounds illogical, but I just don't want a diagnosis to follow me around, or to be stripped of my ability to be independent.  And I don't want to be forced to take pills that make you fat, lazy, and less creative just to maintain my independence.  I'm fine.  I'm in control.  I have a job, I am going to university, and I'm living with my family in Canada.  I have some good days where the fog in my head clears and I can mostly enjoy things.  I just don't know what is going on with my mind the other times, if I can trust myself, if I am actually losing grips with reality, or if I am just convincing myself that things are worse than they are for attention or to sabotage my own future.  I'm an adult, I shouldn't be such a parasite, but I just wanted to see what other people think.  I feel so isolated and exhausted and stressed. 
If there is anything I can do on my own to fix this without destroying my life, please help me.

136,"It's just everyday there's some sort of negative, self-harm or suicidal thought. I can't control my thoughts either and because of that I haven't been able to get anything done for a very long time now. I'm 21 right now and still in the same place when I was 11. The only things that escalated are my negative thoughts, hair loss and weight gain. I'm just tired you know. I don't know what I'm supposed to do at this point. I'm not useful to anyone, not even myself. I just feel like there's no purpose to my life and I can't do anything for anyone around me. Everyone around me is moving on and getting somewhat better at handling life but I can't move on nor sort myself out. I just feel like I'm being lazy but I want to get shit done. I really do but I feel really at a loss and haven't been able to get myself together for too long now. I know others have their difficulties and in no way do I feel like I'm going through a lot. I'm just very weak minded and lazy, but even when there's intent to go through something, I can't power through it. Man and it really gets to me. Because it's been going for way too long and everyday I tell myself it'll get better. But it's just not. At one point my family was what kept me going. I heard something about suicide going through the family. It made me think about my sisters and fear that. I've been self harming properly since I was 12 and when my sister was 12, she came back home with scratches on her arm. They weren't deep and were on the skin lightly, but I knew what it was immediately and just felt so heartbroken and afraid. Afraid that she'd seen my scars and did it because of me and ever since I've hidden my scars regardless. I talked to her about it and listened to why she did it, though I never said I've done it. I asked what lead to it and she said that she was just annoyed at the teacher and saw the scissors. She's in a better place because I do talk and listen to her often about how she's feeling. I've bought her some notebooks that have beautiful quotes to help her out in times of distress. Because of both my younger sisters, I really didn't want to do anything that could lead to them being hurt or even worse. I didn't want to hurt my mother. And I still don't obviously. But the only thing that's keeping me is my religion. I'm not religious but I have strong faith. Which is pretty pointless since I'm not able to correlate my so called strong faith with religious acts. But it keeps me going to some extent. And I guess part of me wants to believe that it will get better. I try not to self harm but instead when I'm angry or feeling an influx of emotions, I hit myself. Which is still self harm but I guess it's better than leaving scars. I don't know.
The suicidal thoughts are ever so present though. I'm just so tempted and even if I don't have a bad day, I still want to. I feel like my days aren't good nor bad. They're just there, passing by indifferently. I just feel tired. I try to work through it and I know I keep saying this but I just don't know anymore. I really don't know if I've hit low and if I can keep hitting low. Nothing seems pointless but I feel so pointless and just a waste of space. I keep planning ways to end it all and I know I'm too much of a chicken to go through the lengths but when I see easy routes through items around me, I just envision it and mentally gravitate towards it. But I don't know I guess. Maybe I'm just tired and need a walk or something. 
But I thought maybe that it would be a good idea for me to seek advice from my fellow online redditors. I would reach out for professional help but I'm afraid of that because of the ass shit community I live in and it's expensive through other methods.
But I hope everyone is having a good day, wherever you are. And I pray that whatever difficulties you may be going through, you're able to persevere and overcome it all. I pray that life treats you well and that you'll soon experience better and happier days.",22Jul2019,1
137,"How can I deal with obsessive thoughts? I've had an obsessive thought whether should I close the windows (living on the 8th floor) in case someone tries to come through them or not, or my unconsciousness it constantly bringing the thought that I have to clean something at home, but fulfilling it won't help because there instantly emerges another thought that I have to clean something.

   
I'm almost sure I'm neurotic and suffer from inferiority complex. I can trace the feeling of guilt for not keeping the house clean to my childhood when my mum was accusing me of being lazy and not vacuuming the flat.

   
I'm also getting tired of constantly analyzing my thoughts and behaviour in an attempt to correct them as if I'm trying to become an ideal ***me***. In other words -- I'm 100% sure I have perfectionistic tendencies.

   
I also have an obsession with googling, I can literally spend 3-4 hours just googling the same thing which gives me a short relief, but the urge comes back not long after. I (I think) always google about my mental health, doing something right, for example, ""should I study 3 or 5 hours"", ""should I take notes or not"" et cetera. Afraid of being wrong and correspondingly not perfect.   
 

I have other fears which are characteristicfor this complex -- fear of judgement, fear of the future (my life won't go perfect; severe doubt in my abilities), low self-esteem.

   
This all leads to dysautonimia and more specifically -- chest tightness. Then I go on a binge streak on sugar.

   
What self-help books can you suggest me? I know of CBT and I use it to rationalize my unlogical thoughts, and it does help. Sometimes I give in to the negative thinking patterns and fall in depression, but then, after the depressive episode, I'm back on track to become a ""superhuman"".

This time I won't allow it, I want to deal with the real issue which isn't my imperfection.",22Jul2019,1
138,"I can feel time slipping through my fingers, but I'm doing nothing. Is it laziness? Procrastination? I could write that email I was supposed to write a month ago. I could try to seek any kind of help, counseling perhaps. I could try to plan out my future cause I can't keep lying to my parents. But what the hell am I doing? Nothing. I could be doing so many things, but I'm doing nothing. And I don't know how to get out of this. 

I know it sounds so stupid and ridiculous and pathetic. I know it does. But it's like I'm wasting away my life. Maybe I should have goals in life, but I feel kinda empty. Like, there's nothing I'm dying to do. There's nothing worth it. 

In short, I'm procrastinating my life and it wouldn't bother me one bit, if it weren't for all the expectations society has.

139,"I've been getting some odd sensations &amp; wanted to see if anyone has experienced these as a result of starting Prozac. I'm not sure if they're related or not, but they've all been happening for about 4 days: 

* Increased muscle tension, causing a great deal of neck/shoulder discomfort. 
* Sometimes I will stand up after sitting and feel like walking takes a great deal less effort than usual - almost like I'm being propelled forward. 
* A frequent feeling of very mild shaking throughout my body, almost like my body feels like it's vibrating or buzzing. 
* Increased sexual arousal (like strictly physical arousal, not mental).

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** 28F. I take (and have been for years) 20 mg Adderall XR daily for ADHD. *Started taking Prozac for depression &amp; anxiety two weeks ago today* \- 10 mg/day for 5 days &amp; 20 mg/day since. I'm currently in the process of mental health screening with a counselor, so no conditions (other than ADHD) to report until I see her tomorrow. I'm a long time sufferer of both anxiety &amp; depression; however, I avoided getting professional help until two weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Side effects I feel confident attributing to the Prozac: insomnia/sleep disturbance since about day 3 &amp; hot flashes since the end of the first week.
