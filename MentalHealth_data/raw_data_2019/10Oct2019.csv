0,"**Although still a taboo topic to a certain extent, depression is a serious problem in need of an immediate solution. Depression is a condition of feeling powerless and lonely and is more typical for women, rather than men.**

**As a sneaky condition, depression is very hard to diagnose, especially if the patient is unwilling to show any related symptoms. Aside from being stressed and feeling hopeless, there are many other indications which can diagnose depression in women.**

### 9 Early Signs of Depression in Women:

### 1-No Energy

**Depression takes away the will to be active and in good spirits. If you are feeling fatigued and overly exhausted for no good reason, you might be suffering a form of depression.** 

### 2- Poor Sleep

**Insomnia and related sleep problems can be direct signs of depression in women. If you are waking up in the middle of the night, struggling to fall back to sleep, depression might be the reason for it.**

### 3-Feeling Desperate

**Despair is a horrible sensation and a clear symptom of depression. Women fighting depression will often feel hopeless, finding no way out of a situation, and having no clue how to get out of this mess.** 

### 4-Mood Swings

**Depression is a difficult condition to diagnose, but it comes with plenty of escalating mood swings. In women, a sudden turn to anger or revolt may be a sign of depression and can deteriorate the beneficial relationships in one’s life.**

### 5-Eating Problems

**Depression suppresses the appetite in women, which can later lead to many nutritional issues and additional health problems.**

### 6-No Interest

**Women suffering from depression often lose interest in everything they do. From a simple chore to being intimate with your partner, a lack of a will can be an early sign of this disorder.**

### 7-Self-Harm

**Women fighting depression frequently experience death-related thoughts and have considered suicide at one point or another. Suicide is never a solution, and it can empower and worsen the stage of depression you are in.**

### 8-Feeling Superficial

**Depressed women will oftentimes feel as if they don’t belong anywhere, or as if their mind and souls are emptied of emotions and feelings. While this is not the case, depression tends to twist our thoughts and make us detached from the real world.** 

### 9-Loss of Focus

**Women who have serious troubles focusing on getting things done could be facing early depression symptoms. Distraction is typical for depression, especially in women, and it is not to be taken lightly.**

**Know that depression, and particularly in females, is very easy to spot and diagnose. For that, an honest conversation or getting professional help can contribute to overcoming the condition and going back to your happy, fulfilled life.**",10Oct2019,169
1,"Ever since school started about 2 months ago, I’ve started to feel an extreme lack of motivation to do anything.
Last year I was a star runner for my cross country team and this year I can’t seem to find a reason to get up and go to practice other than my parents telling me to.
In my classes, I used to have extreme anxiety attacks if I got anything below an 80, and this year I can fail a test without blinking an eye and move on. 
Even in things I like to do, like drawing or acting,  it feels pointless every time I sit down and try to get something done. 

It just feels like everything I do is on a cycle. Get up, go to practice, go to class, workout again, rehearsal, do homework, swim practice, go to sleep, repeat. 

I used to have pretty bad anxiety, and semi-present paranoia, but at this point it just feels like a pit in my stomach. Even attempts to try and get better seem like a pointless task.

Any tips on how to get myself out of this loop?",10Oct2019,1
2,"Maybe it sounds stupid but it makes me crazy. Really. Everyday i get a earworm from songs i never heard years ago. All genres. Pop. Rock. Heavy metal. Japanese cartoons. When i ignore it, it goes louder and louder, very intensive. It hardly goes away and lasts the whole day. Sometimes i try to listen to it so it goes away but i cant find the song. So the earworm lasts. I always thought you can get an earworm only from songs you recently heard but not out of nowhere songs you never heard years ago
Please help me am i crazy?",10Oct2019,1
3,"I work as a pizza delivery guy and today one of my female co-workers came in absolutely bawling. Both of my managers went to the back room to console her but she was so upset that she couldn't even begin working until she had already been there for fifteen or twenty minutes. Now I have only been working there for a couple of weeks and I've never spoken to this girl at all. In fact I can barely remember her name. But for some reason, seeing her so upset really upset me too? I should clarify that I'm not really attracted to her on a physical level and I literally don't know anything about her which means I'm not attracted to her on any other level either, so that was not influencing my reaction. And besides, it's been over a year since I finally took the hint that *no one wants me* and gave up pursuing relationships. But nonetheless, I felt this strong compulsion to go back there and listen to what was going on with her so that I could tell her she was strong enough to get through it. But I can't wrap my head around why I felt this way! She shouldn't mean anything to me and Lord knows I don't mean anything to her. So why do I feel the need to involve myself in situations which cannot possibly benefit me? I did talk myself out of consoling her, but I still couldn't shake the feeling that I should have said something. I've always had a problem of getting far too attached to people far too quickly - especially people who are apathetic or downright hateful towards me. I have *zero* attachments outside of my parents. My life is entirely *drama free!* The only person whose problems I *have* to deal with is myself and I hardly ever *have* any problems because I don't interact with anyone besides my parents in real life. Why would I want to change that? Why would I want to get involved with people who will inevitably end up hating me? Do I have some kind of saviour complex?",10Oct2019,1

Am I mistaken by the nature of what constitutes a psychosis?

Is it possible for a person to experience psychosis or psychosise(s) from things like dialoguing with strangers or from exposure to ideas one is aversed to?

5,"No matter how hard I try, I constantly recieve criticism from my parents. No matter how hard I try to be what they tell me I should be, they never support me. Any compliment I recieve is back handed (ex: ""your house looks nice today..... Maybe you can finally keep it that way""). My younger sister gets praise and approval consistently, despite the fact that she has a girlfriend (this is a BIG no-no in my parents religion, Jehovah's witnesses). I am constantly told how I need to improve and how everything that has gone wrong in my life or my children's, is entirely my fault. All I've ever seeked from childhood is approval, but I just. Wont. Recieve it. If my own parents dont love and support me, maybe I'm not worthy of praise. I hear others talk about their ""good dad"" or ""good mom"" and it simply further instills the idea into my head that the problem is with me. I am deffective.  My siblings (younger brother- former heroine addict, my younger sister- suicidally depressed) that were not baptized, get a pass that I don't. They have the potential to be saved.  However, I have not only doomed my 14 yo baptized self, but also all of my 3 girls to die at Armageddon- and with no hope of a resurrection.  I truly believe my parents are good, wholesome people.  .. So the problem has GOT to be with me, right? I'm scorned for questioning things because, to them, all I'm doing is ""making excuses to behave"" the way I ""want to"" and feel is right.  I don't think I will ever really be able to accept that the problem isn't with me. I feel with all my heart that I am truly flawed and worthless.  I don't know how I can change that.. I don't know what to do anymore.  My greatest fear and torture is the thought of losing my family. They are all I have.  My mom has made a point to tell me that she'll still stay in touch with my sister's (soon to be ex, but for personal and good reasons) girlfriend (a terrible human,.. Truly) but never any family member that's disfellowshipped.  I would have never married my first (intensely) abusive husband were it not for the fear of being disfellowshipped (he was also a member). I had to apologise to my childhood raper for accusing him (a baptized brother).  My brain can't wrap around any of this and I don't know what to do or where to start to not feel so gadDAMNED SAD anymore. I just want to be enough....",10Oct2019,1

11,"hello all,

i'm currently a third year in college, and as of this year, i have to start going to weekly/biweekly sessions for therapy. this means that i had to transition from one college-endorsed mental health service to another that offers more appointments, but i got some very disappointing news today over a phone call:

""we cannot see you anymore based on the amount of times that you have been late to appointments""

now, i understand why they have this policy put in place (i was late three times, and two of those times i had valid explanation as to why i was late and i was unaware that there was a limit on times you can be late), but i'm just disappointed in both myself and the service provided. today was my third strike because i missed the bus on the way to the appointment, and then consequently missed my appointment. the people who were running the front desk were incredibly rude to me and brushed me aside, and the person who called me was just laughing as she told me. i have a lot of anxiety today and the best i can do for now is go back to the college-endorsed mental health service this friday and explain what's going on, but i feel like my reasoning is dumb as to why i haven't gotten help yet. i feel like i've always just been going through these ""screening"" appointments but i'll never get help. i hate this program called ""telehealth"" offered by my school because 1) the video service is laggy and 2) it feels very impersonal. that is all. i'm not sure what to do other than explain to my previous therapist what has been going on because i'm very confused as to what my next steps are.",10Oct2019,1

13,"and it was from something really weird.

so I'm into romantic porn, like really vanilla couples stuff. call me weird if you want but I do. and there's one channel on Pornhub I'm really into with this one girl and her boyfriend, who are very obviously genuinely in love, not putting on a show for the camera.

I watch a bunch of their older videos as a couple and I keep thinking how cute they are together and how they should get married. then while scrolling through the comments  I see some comments talking about how sad it was, what happened to him, and how bad they feel for her.

so I check out her twitter and it turns out her boyfriend actually passed away several months ago. and you could see that the whole time he was sick she was desperate for him to get better. and the pain when she posted that he had died.

now, it's not as if I've never had anyone close to me die, but i've never had much of an emotional reaction to death. my aunt died a few years ago, leaving behind my uncle and their baby daughter - i was stoic in the face of that. my best friend's brother died earlier this year - i was able to put on a brave face.

but something about this - it fucking broke me. and i don't even know what it is about this pornstar's boyfriend in particular that made me finally feel the impact of death but it did. it's actually kind of funny, and I would be laughing, if I weren't shaking and crying as I was writing this.

I try to be a good person and lift people around me up. I like to think I can make a difference in people's lives. Maybe in some small ways, I can. But I can't save the ones I care about, deliver them completely from pain. Because eventually, the void will reclaim us all.",10Oct2019,1

15,"I am looking for input as various doctors have given me their opinions and many prescriptions have worked the opposite than what they prescribed them for....

I have had social anxiety/general anxiety for as long as I can remember (started on Paxil in 3rd grade) that worked for awhile and around middle school/early high school it wore out and I switched to a few other SSRIs until Prozac was one that worked. Now it is about 14 years since I started on Prozac and I have been given increasing doses over the past years, now I’m at the MAX 80mg a day. I went to a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and social worker to get input on my troubles. I’ve been prescribed and I swear it made my issues worse, (alongside my Prozac) buspirone, rexulti and abilify. And all seemed to make me more irritable and anxious.

My symptoms lately (last year or so) have been: low desire to do anything but watch tv, (however I do have 3 jobs currently and work 55 hours a week, so I don’t watch tv 24/7 lol). EXTREME IRRITABILITY (&amp;not just from PMDD (lady troubles)) I cry easily, I yell, I just constantly feel on edge. I can be very mean and I can and do knit pick the littlest things people do and sometimes will dwell on them for hours. At times I’m happy (not as much lately though) and feel hopeful and can get stuff done but it doesn’t last long, maybe a day or two. I’ve been told I could be bipolar? But my understanding of bipolar is extreme highs and lows for months at a time. Not just changing day to day. I don’t really have times of excessive spending or anything like that. And I usually can sleep all night and usually (although it has been worse) getting and staying asleep.

So, I'm 16, diagnosed with depression, PTSD, high functioning anxiety, and a plethora of other things I'd like to keep to myself as they're irrelevant. I've been going through a lot of stress but keeping my mental stability quite reasonably well. But I've noticed I've just been crying out of nowhere? I normally don't like crying, due to my upbringing and simply not liking to be vulnerable. I just don't understand, I could be in a fine mood and then suddenly I just start bawling? It's not the hormonal type thing, that bits over with for the week, but I haven't had this happen in a while, since a traumatic experience a while back. Nothing traumatic has happened recently, all i can think of is having to move and deal with the death of a loved one.. but I've dealt with this before? I dunno.

18,"Early twenties female, but I would rather not elaborate beyond that. For some background, I have both generalized anxiety and major depression, both formally diagnosed. I am on medication for it, having changed it and the doses multiple times, and spoken to several therapists about my issues. However, no amount of talking or medication has helped at all. My previous therapist taught me how to challenge thoughts, but not even that has worked. I just don't understand why, and over the last several years, my symptoms have been worsening. Today they caused a bad fight with a close friend, and I'm honestly uncertain of the fate of said friendship after that. My forty-day streak of no self-harm was broken afterwards.

I've decided to write down what I've been experiencing as of late. I am seeing a new therapist tomorrow and I think it will help me collect my thoughts to explain them to her. I don't know if it will be much help though. But basically, here's what's been going on.

My biggest fear is that everyone will eventually abandon me, and it seems to be becoming a reality. I constantly lash out at friends and family, taking personal offense from their actions very easily. When someone hurts me, I fear that they have always actually hated me and wanted to hurt me. My friendships are starting to erode because of this behavior, but thinking rationally does nothing to stop it. My emotions are what is controlling my actions. I get very argumentative, and after arguing with someone I often resort to self-destructive behaviors. I have been cutting for months. I'm worried my best friends will all eventually leave me, and I don't feel like I could handle that emotionally. I'm afraid I will kill myself.

I don't know why I'm like this. Is it because my depression and anxiety are so bad? But regardless I need treatment of some sort, because I can't keep living as this vile person.",10Oct2019,3
19,"I had basically a nervous breakdown in 2016–2017 and failed out of college. I was on Wellbutrin and Buspirone for two years until a week ago. I have been fine but go through periods (maybe weeks at a time) where I feel depressed, anxious, and miserable. Not as bad as when I had my nervous breakdown but bad enough to interfere with my life. I was fine the whole summer but a week before school started I started feeling depressed/anxious again. Last week I went to my nurse practitioner and told her how I felt. I mentioned maybe trying to switch to Effexor. She was cool with that, said she thought Effexor was an excellent antidepressant. 

I am so tired lol. I can barely make it through the day. Walking from the kitchen to the couch takes so much energy. I still have full use of my mind, which is actually different from when I took Lexapro in 2017 (terrible brain fog and I couldn’t get out of bed). I also take adderall and Strattera so it’s not like she can add a stimulant. I slept all last week, slept the entire weekend. I have no problem sleeping at night. No improvement in anxiety/depression. I crave carbs, which is kind of a good thing because the past month I’ve lost a lot of weight from lack of appetite. 

I can always call her nurse and ask if I should come in for another appointment or if she can prescribe me something else, or up my dosage.

Mom raped, beat, mentally and verbally abused me, dad was non existent. 
Mom abandoned me with adoptive parents who did not want me, adoptive dad was worse if not the same as my bio mom
CPS and police was constantly involved but never took me away and failed to protect me (not a shocker where I live)
At 8 I had to raise myself, I was constantly bullied, 
At 14 years old my only friend was brutally murdered 
For the next many years I was bullied, abused, used, battled suicide, anxiety and depression.
At 20 my adoptive mom died (affected me a lot)
At 20 I married to a woman who never loved me, gave me what I wanted (a child) took all my money and ran away with a close “friend” and never saw my child again to this day. 

I struggle to hold down a job, stay in school and surround myself around others in society. I am sociologically alone. I am very intelligent and hold a high IQ as well as enjoy education and learning very much. 

I have a tendency to bounce from choosing what career I want to do with my life (one week it’s DR, next 2 weeks lawyer, next week it’s a computer software engineer, next few months it’s a animal enthusiast, etc) 

One month I want to move out of the country next I want to live entirely someone off the grid and untouched by the world. The next minute I am trying to change my name, make up a story of my life and how I’m actually an entire different race/ethnicity and learning everything I can about the culture to back my story and hide my past.

For the past years I've been secretive about my suicidal thoughts, attempts and substance addiction, I've been suffering from a long-term emptiness, sadness and loneliness, I actively find reasons to stay but I couldn't, the only thing holding me back is the thought of suicide being stupid as everyone would say ""that guy is weak"" or ""that guys is dumb for killing himself"" and the thought of abandoning my dog. 

To overcome the the cold emptiness I developed a personality trait, that is furious and extremely motivated for success and power, I developed a second personality that is very logical and calculated.

I've been disappointed with my relationships with people I learned how distrust them and to counter their bad deeds by manipulating them, I've learned how to be the one who's in control.

I’ve never had a significant other and I’m too awkward around people I like to ever get one. I do have a good set of friends though. I don’t even know if what I’m doing in university is what I want to do and if I decide to switch majors or drop out I’ll have wasted thousands of dollars for nothing. I’m not known for being funny, really nice, or anything except just “being there” (someone actually told me that). I get upset about these things and everyone tells me I set my standards for myself too high, but I feel like they’re already wayyy too low. Thinking about other people having jobs, a partner, good grades, hobbies, and a good social life makes me feel so awful. I feel like I’m a constant embarrassment to my parents. The only time I’ve been consistently happy was when I was doing well in school in the last year of high school. I’m so mad at myself that my happiness relies entirely on how I’m doing in school. I don’t know how to like myself without that. I just feel like there’s nothing about me worth anything other than school, but I’m not even super above average or anything. I know it’s not healthy but I don’t know how to change. How do you like yourself when you’re pretty much a failure in almost every avenue of your life? 

tl;dr: I hate myself if I’m not doing well in school. Nothing else makes me feel ok about myself. What are you supposed to rely on to feel good about yourself? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",10Oct2019,1
32,"I feel like I'm always drowning in my emotions and that I'm always stuck in my head like I'm floating above everything as a ghost. I can't make decisions and I don't really have an identity. I can't live in the moment just keep detaching and observing then over-analyzing like i'm in this unalive limbo. 

i feel this way 95% of the time. in the 5% when i feel awake and alive again, i can be as productive as i want to be and i can talk to my family without over-exhaustion. but for most of the time i feel like i'm stuck in a hurricane and can't get anything done unless under extreme pressure. i can't talk to others and i just feel so lonely and dissatisfied. 

i don't have anything but social anxiety and low self-esteem, but i don't think that's the cause of my indecision and lack of productivity. i can't get simple assignments done till 3 am. time just escapes me and i don't even know how i spend it. just sitting around i guess.

34,"But right now I’m not. This past summer I felt so confident, empowered, and happy. I had lost weight, and finally felt comfortable in my skin. These past few weeks I was okay. Happy enough, but still had my small moments of depression/anxiety. The past couple of days, however, have been really low. Like today. A few things happened, though they weren’t completely major, and I had a panic attack. I had not had one in a while, so I was trying really hard to calm myself. My depression is also at a very low point. I’ve just been crying a lot and feeling hopeless. Ive been having suicidal ideations, or really just thinking about something bad happening to me. I don’t necessarily want to die, just to either not exist, or get hurt in some way. But then I think of the people I love, and feel bad. Another thing is, is that I think I’m starting to develop an eating disorder. I’ve gained about 7 lbs from the past few weeks. Though I still “notice” that I’m pretty, I’ve been overeating, and eating more unhealthy than usual, even if I’m not hungry. And then I’ll make myself throw up after.

36,"I need help.

For the past couple of months I suspect that I have ADHD, and need help. My parents took me to a pediatrician who prescribed me Concerta 27mg. The first day I took it, I couldn’t believe how much it helped me. I could finally understand lessons taught by my teachers. 

This only lasted one day as my mom randomly turned against medication and said how”you don’t have ADHD you are using it is an excuse to your laziness.” At this point I gave up. I did not know what to do. Ever since, I have been mentally abused everyday being called lazy, stupid, useless the list goes on and on. I believe this has really affected me and has caused me to become more sensitive to people comments. 

I recently started my last year of high school and two days ago I emailed my teacher about my situation. She was very supportive and made me finally feel like someone cared for me. Despite not having an IEP or diagnosis, she was willing to provide me extra time for test, which I really appreciate her doing. She told me how despite not having a diagnosis, she can see the ADHD symptoms that I have.

Today, I emailed her in which I said if she would be willing to email my mom into getting me diagnosed. Since my mom won’t believe me, I’m hoping she will believe my teacher.

All the mental abuse has made me a more negative person. I am not as happy as I used to be, and find my self getting mad way more often than I should. I feel more sad too whenever I think about my future as I cannot do daily task without getting yelled at by my parents, and even my sister. I also notice how I hate my parents and sister due to the mental abuse am suffering. I also notice how I am more happy at school/away from my parents and sister, but as soon as I’m near them, I feel sad/angry.

Any suggestions as to what I could possibly be suffering from?

(my family is Native American &amp; I was raised to believe in many different wild monsters, which is embarrassing when people ask what they are and why) My first time seeing them was when I was 12-13? After I had sleep paralysis, ever since then I haven’t been able to sleep without some sort of light on. I have led lights in my room for when it’s dark, bc my rooms are dim enough during the day, and they stay on because I’m scared I’ll wake up and see something in front of my bed looking back at me. I don’t talk about it with anyone, I don’t want people to think I’m crazy when this could just be my fears doing. But a few weeks ago they began moving.

41,"Hey everyone,   
I honestly dont know how to start this. I obviously cant (due to the post becoming too long, not me not wanting to share it!) cant write down everything in detail... So I will try to keep it short and in case further info would help just let me know!

So the main problem is, that I can not do shit. Like nothing. Obviously this applies to my ""big"" goals in life, I am 28, still havent finished my degree and my job experience is existent but after the novelty of a new job wears off I loose ANY motivation to even go there until I get kicked out within a year basically. My appartment looks like a garbage can, like I literally have rotten meat in the kitchen stinking away and it doesnt bother me at all? I can not keep social connections (like even with my closest family I love?) rly active as well. When I look forward to a party or sth. its very often that I will loose all interest in it a week or so before it happens and usually ending up lying in bed doing literally nothing while telling everyone that I am sick or sth. And if I get myself together I am like 5 hours late to my best friends birthday part or something. The same applies to playing video games, watching shows, working out. Whatever brings me joy, satisfaction or any form of fullfilment just becomes meaningless within a short ammount of time.

However, emotional spikes help me out of this. It can be bad or good but at the end I usually start seeing clearly again and it feels like I can link effort/reward whereas normally it feels more like all my goals and ambitions (even those that are required to life a normal daily life) dissapear behind milk glass (if that makes any sense??). I also dont feel bad about bad things then, so I could have just lost my job, have a lawsuit regarding me loosing my flat and wouldnt even worry about it at all. But having an unexpected hookup, seeing my girlfriend if I have one and rly care for her or sometimes even just not passing exams will help me get this clearer view on things again. 

Because I usually got what I wanted in life when I actually put effort into it I know that I can fight myself through the shit I am currently in. So just recently I lost my job and almost my flat too. Still have my flat (lawsuit has been ""stopped?""), about to get an even better job than I had before... But this happens allways and then I just dont feel like paying rent (even though I have the money on my bank account I just dont want to type in the numbers??) and dont want to do anything in my job anymore (whereas before that I will like thinking about it constantly, have fun and be so productive). And not saying it will happen again now, but if the trend continues I will be fighting exmatriculation at my university while probably being jobless within the next couple of months...

And its not even about not having success, good grades or whatever. All I strife for, look for is me DOING something with my time. Like I dont need no good grades, just let me study the couple of hours I usually need to pass. I dont have to have the cleanest appartment but at least clean enough that I can invite someone over from time to time without haveing to clean it 2 days straight before that. I dont need no fancy stuff or money to be happy either. I just want to live a life basically. Instead of just laying in bed and doing nothing outside of rewatching the same youtube junk content that kind of hypnotitzes me into doing nothing until I fall asleep again I would want to just waking up and finally having the energy to do the smallest everyday tasks.

I have seen psychologists and therapeuts who told me I seem to have an depression but due to me not having the money and psychological therapy being kind of hard to come bye in my country there rly isnt a lot I can do against it. I have allways been self treating myself when I felt bad or whatever and usually with decent success. Ive allways been shy, felt jealaous and most of those things arent anymore... But if it comes to geting up in the morning, doing normal life things I just cant. For a long time I thought its me just being lazy... but at this point I actually get physically sick whenever exam week comes and I have signed up for exams. I feel like I have to vommit all the time. This shit takes me straight through hell at this point. 

Like I dont know where to go from here with the last kind of therapy I can see is a psychologist prescribing me some kind of drugs and hoping for the best? Also I just realized my post got so long in the end. Soooo... thanks to anyone who read through it :)",10Oct2019,1

45,"Where do I even begin? 

To start I’ve been struggling to post or even write this for years as my dad has always been like this, I thought it was normal but he has serious problems. Other than that I am 17 and will try my best to describe as much and as far back as I can.

First I don’t know much about my dad. Even some basic information he just never opens up anyone in the family. I had to sneak into his room just to find what year he graduated. My dad never talks to my mom. She always complains about how the only reason why they are together is because I’m here, which fair enough I guess, but I’m reaching the end of my sanity as we speak. 

Second, my dad twitches and jerks his shoulders up and swears and talks about people under his breathe when he is alone and talks about an imaginary guy named bill. It’s really hard to explain as even when I was I kid (when he really didn’t hide it as I was a dumb kid right?) he talks very angrily to himself all the time. 

Another thing that he has is major anger issues. He’s the guy you see in doctors offices that yells at the receptionist and gets in everyone’s face about how corrupt the government (more on that later.) This is why anyone in our entire family NEVER unless we absolutely have to go out in public with him. Whether it be a reasturant, hospital, or work he is always very impatient. He works as a medical engineer so he gets extra furious around any medical place...

Third, when you speak or make conversation he never takes anything you say seriously. That or he saids hold on a minute and leaves the room to never return to talk. He does this especially badly with my mom. He also takes dad jokes to a new level of terrible. If you ever try to point out the flaws in his arguments or don’t agree to a joke he made he saids the same thing... “I’m just joking, I’m just joking!” Then he laughs and looks at you directly and smiles. I’m a very chill person by nature so it does not bother me that much because you get used to insanity. But my older sister has the same anger as my dad. So it’s like my dad knows it hurts her and does it anyways just to pressure her to do things she’ll regret, It’s terrible.

Fourth, know I’m getting into territory that I know very little of about my dad as not even MY MOM knows who’s my dad has dated in the past. And my mom is a very open person basically the total opposite of my dad. I do know that in like I believe 2009ish-2011ish my dad was diagnosed with major depression. Which surprised me at the time but makes sense knowing who he was then. 

My dad used to be an alcoholic but cannot drink anymore as his liver cannot take anymore. But he sneaks out weekly anyways and goes to his friends Chris and drinks. 

My dad works a ton. Always has from what I’ve heard. Till his 40’s he’s always worked at least 3 jobs and had a side business which he still runs to this day. He’s a handyman, mechanic, electrician, painter (insanely good), artist, and overall can do anything with his hands. He has three places that he owns and constantly works and builds them all on his own. Long story short he’s a workaholic. The total opposite of me. 

As for politics I don’t even know where to start... He loves talking about “THE MAFIA, AND CRIMINALS!” And how no matter who you put into office they are all going to do the same thing. He thinks all of politics are corrupt but still votes. He goes to his parents weekly and they talk about the wildest stuff about how all the politicians are criminals. 

His childhood is unknown to me, I know that he had like 5-6 sisters and he was the only son. He was a middle child. His grades were above average until high school (just like me.) in high school teachers described his as distracted, he showed up less and less often. He started drinking. (Learned all that from reading stuff from his room.) 

His life at home was troubled I think? It’s speculation at best as only he knows but as they are my grandparents they are bizarre. His mom is a nutcase. Or she was until she started taking heavy doses of some sort of medication. I’ve heard rumors of abuse, but as it stands today she’s the normal loving grandmother. My dad’s dad served in the Cold War and was in the navy. He’s lost about half his hearing from factory work after the military. He’s very overweight now. They are also quite racist. Probably the most racist people that I know sadly. Honestly I wish I could give more info but that’s all I really know for now. 

I think this is a good start until I think of more cause there definitely is a ton more but, gotta save it for later.

What are your opinions on my dad? Does he have some sort of mental condition? My mom has speculated many things from simple ADHD, to crazy stuff like Bipolar disorder, Multipersonality disorder, Schizophrenia, and much more. Please help",10Oct2019,3
46,"I would never identify with that word, but I've been experiencing feelings that definitely could be placed under that umbrella. I'm at college, in a house with guys where a decent amount of sex is happening around me, and I'm single, and to be honest kinda feel like shit about it. A bad breakup caused me to spiral into enough of a depression for my grades to drop, and it's been a year since then, and now I'm still working on mental health and focusing on school. I feel like if I really was just following my gut, sex/intimacy is all I want in life to me happy right now. I really miss it. I'm not someone who has a lot of passion for my major... but I am really good at getting things done if I'm in a 'flow state' and feel content about things, which back when I was in a relationship I was really into, came easily. 

But it's been so long, now I feel like I have to fake it to be excited for my roommates when they're talking about their sex lives or relationships. I feel inadequate. I don't enjoy seeing couples enjoying nice days, etc. etc. I've felt great about myself in the past, but now I just feel super undesirable when it's just me and my thoughts. I know this isn't true, but I had one specific really toxic ex who would make me feel like shit (the last one) and on top of that I've always had really negative self talk.

 I had a moment of clarity tonight talking to an older ex of mine that I still connect with every now and then, who is one of the only people I find it really easy to let my feelings flow with. It came naturally talking to her when I admitted these things (which I haven't even told my therapist! too awkward), and it felt good to get it out. I realized the SHAME I typically carry about such feelings, perhaps due to not wanting to be seen in any way as an ""incel"", makes it even worse. Cause not only will I feel this way, I'll pretend super hard that I don't, which is anxiety inducing and unproductive.

I have always found working full time overwhelming and wished I didn’t have to do it, but now I’m here it’s just another thing I’ve failed at. I can’t talk to anyone about it because I know they’ll just be angry I’m complaining, and I honestly agree with them, I feel guilty constantly for not finding any happiness in being free from work.

The worst fight was this summer when both my sister (and her husband and 1 month old) and I were at my parents’ for July 4. The fight culminated with her saying I was the most useless person [because of my years of crippling depression].

I had a sobbing breakdown in front of the baby. My sister immediately said sorry. But the damage was done.

After that fight my sister and brother in law said I couldn’t see my niece unless I apologized. They didn’t want me and my crazy around baby. I apologized bc I didn’t want to argue any more.

Eventually they decided I am welcome around their baby. They ask me if I want to hold her and play with her and stuff.

The thing is, I feel so bad being around my niece now. And I feel like she can sense that. Can babies sense depression? Can babies remember trauma? Like at a subconscious level. That was probably the first time my niece saw people that upset, the first time she heard shouting out of anger.

This past weekend I rode in the backseat with her and we locked eyes and after a moment, she started crying. And then the cry turned inconsolable. She isn’t usually like that on car rides.

I also feel like my niece isn’t as smiley with me as she is with other people. The guilt of my mental state follows me wherever I go.

When it was time to leave I tried to make it breezy. But then my sister said “Wait, you didn’t say bye to [baby]!” So I warily went back and waved at the baby and said bye.

I feel like the weight of my mental illness is affecting how much I love her. I love babies and they typically love me, but this is my own blood relative and she’s so new and impressionable and I’m afraid of my bad energy rubbing off on her somehow.

I feel wary when holding her and wary when I’m in her sight.

I don’t know if any of you have experience being an aunt or uncle with depression. I want so bad to be a good aunt and love my niece but this is holding me back.",10Oct2019,1

54,"I would never wish this fucking feeling upon anyone even my worst enemy, I don’t necessarily feel suicidal but I honestly would rather be dead.

55,I really could use some professional help,10Oct2019,1
56,"I've been medicated since October 2009 - varying drugs and doses, but always something. In this time there have been probably dozens of prescribers, in part because of changes in insurance including times on Medicaid (which we call AHCCCS here). I know at least one of my providers, the first, has closed down as a practice. There have also been multiple hospitalizations. 

I'd like to collect my own records. It's really something I feel I should've been doing all along. Right now it's not urgent, I don't need them for anyone or anything else, I just want them. (So I'm not applying for disability or anything like that. I know that would significantly change the approach.)


I'm most interested in medication history and specific diagnoses. (Sometimes my providers have said stuff like 'well it doesn't really matter if it's X or Y, because you're responding to treatment Z'. But they still had to write down X or Y somewhere, and I'm curious.)

I've been trying to think of the best approach. A year or so ago I had the idea that it would be easier to just go after all the different pharmacies... but when I contacted the national customer service for whoever I picked first (Walgreen's? Or Costco?), I was told I'd have to contact each individual store. At the time it was just enough roadblock for me to give up completely. 

So I thought I'd ask Reddit: Any ideas? Has anyone gone through something like this?",10Oct2019,1
57,"So I’d like to preface by saying I’m in no danger to myself but last night I really just got in the spiral of thinking “wow I’ve been suicidal since I was in 4th grade and I’m almost 20 this is going to be my entire life” and it really scares me. I’m afraid that it truly is going to be my whole life of only having small reliefs of pain then just trying to keep myself alive. it’s hard for me to get excited about anything, it has been for years. Is this it?",10Oct2019,1
58,"I was diagnosed with OCD, major depressive disorder, and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (I think that's what it's called), and I have no one to talk to. I'm f15, self harmed for years, my last suicide attempt was a year and a half ago. I was doing great, but I began to self harm once again, and I'm really ashamed. My grandpa just died, so I don't want to talk to my parents about it, because I know they are both going through a lot. I'm not sure if this is a good place to post this, but it's ok. Both the diagnosis and my grandpa's death are weighing heavily on me. My next appointment is Monday with my therapist. We are going to start EMDR cause apparently I have bad memories I blocked out.

I'm a big-time introvert and I just moved to this city a few years ago.  I don't have any friends or a support system.  I find myself crying every day, often over ridiculous things.  I've been in a rut before but this one is proving to be very difficult to get out of.  I really need a friend to slap me out of it, or some good advice.

60,"So this scenario stemmed from a series of me agreeing to things I didn't want to.

First, tonight I worked a shift I didn't want to. My coworker texted me and asked me to take it, and I explained that I have class at 9am tomorrow and I can't, but she asked again and said I'd probably get cut (which I doubted), but I said yes because I can't handle being pressed.

So I work this shift, comes to the last couple hours and I ask a manager to cut me because I've got class. They were going to cut someone else, who we'll call Carol, but they ask her to stay so I can go and she reluctantly agrees.

I leave but realize my phone is dead, like completely dead. I need my phone to get home. I can take the train to a certain point, but the closest it gets me to home still requires a 20 minute walk in a very unsafe area, and at 11pm that's not an option.

So, I go to the bar down the street and grab one drink and ask them to charge my phone. Here comes the second case of not being able to say no. Some dude approaches me and starts talking to me. I'm being polite but not overly friendly. He insists on buying me a drink and I agree under pressure. He doesn't stop, and soon I'm like 3 drinks in because he won't stop chatting me up and **I have a real fear of men's reactions to rejection.**

Some random guy comes up next to me and orders a drink, then turns to me and asks when I need to be up tomorrow. I tell him like 6:30am, the truth, but am confused as to why. Then he gets his drink and I watch him walk over to a table with Carol. *Fuck* . He was testing to see if I was lying about when I had to be up. I had no intentions of being there until she got off.

Basically I feel like a major asshole. Like the worst person on earth. I'm terrible. I'm sure she hates me. Fuck. I left almost immediately and texted her explaining everything and offering her a drink token (worth one free drink at our job and I horde them because the bartenders love me and rarely actually charge me). She hasn't responded and I texted again with my class schedule to prove I actually need to be up that early. I feel awful. I wish I could've said no to the drinks, or giving that creepy guy my number, or even to taking that shift.

Ugh. Am I the worst?",10Oct2019,1
61,"Today represents everything I advocate for. 
And this for anyone who needs support today and every other day. 🌻

World Mental Health Day. ❤

This day is to support and help those suffering by spreading awareness for mental health. Just because someone may look okay to you on the outside or even if they don't, that does not mean you get to judge and make someone feel guilty or bad about themselves because they suffer with a mental illness that is N O T okay, it is never okay to do that period. 

This is how stigma starts and just keeps going spreading everywhere to people making it so much harder for the ones who suffer with a mental illness to cope and to reach out.. they are looked down upon, bullied, casted off to the side because no one believes them and are sometimes called liars. Told things like -  ' get over It' ' snap out of It' , 'you'll be Okay' ' stop being a drama queen' . If you are one of those people who judges you need to remove yourself from my life, because that is disgsuting behaviour and I don't want anything to do with someone who makes it hard for others to reach out and get help. You honestly should be ashamed with yourself and take another look in the mirror and re evaluate because of this stigma, it is ruining peoples confidence to speak to someone and get help, So No. You do not get to decide that so just stop. 

To everyone that knows me personally knows what I struggle with, but to everyone else on the outside, I am the - Loud funny teegs who is always lauging and caring for others. Which is true. But what they don't know is that- I suffer with severe depression and anxiety. 
What they dont see is:  the days where I can not get out of bed because I feel so sad and fatigued,  nights where I can not sleep because I feel worthless, the days I feel lonely and stressed, when I avoid social events because I don't want to be around anyone because its too much that day, when I Isolate myself because I'm so angry,  and they do not see the days and nights where I breakdown and cry because I keep feeling  that I don't want this life anymore, I don't want to be here anymore I'm done with it. Yes im talking about suicide. I will not be ashamed to be open and write about This,  I Shouldn't have to... because this is my life. This is how I feel. This is what I struggle with all the time. Among all the laughs, the smiles, the fun times, being with friends or surrounded by family,  being there for everyone, the lighter days... that is what I go through in between.

Suffering with a mental illness isn't so straight forward either..  it could be 4 days in a row , could be 1 day, could be a week, 3 months.. it could be years that someone or I goes through this. I know there is so many people out there who truly do not understand and that is okay, you don't have to but just be kind. At the end of the day everybody is different, everybody has a different mindset, everyone has gone through something or things that others no nothing about and it can affect a person greatly either for a few days, months or the rest of their life. You are not that person, you do not get the right to judge.  There are so many different mental illness's that people struggle with on a daily basis, and the last thing they want is for someone to make them feel like it is not okay to feel the way they do and that they can not speak about it. Some people have severe illnesses than others but that doesn't matter, we are all still struggling. I do not write this for sympathy, I write this because I know I'm not alone and that I could help someone that is afraid to ask for help.

If you want to help others and end the stigma, ask if they are okay... let them know that it is okay to talk about their mental health, tell them you are here to listen and that everything is going to be okay. Those few words could help someone out more than you know. So today I ask please,  call a loved one, message a friend, hang out with your bestie or work mate. Let them know that you are always here for them and that you love them. I want to remind my family and friends, my work mates old and new or even if we hardly talk... That I am just a mesaage or call away.. my heart is always open to you if you need me don't forget and always remember by asking if someone is okay.... You could save their life. 🌻❤💚❤",10Oct2019,5
62,"So, a while ago, I started going to therapy. I found out that I was honestly just stressed out about a bunch of stuff because I rush into a lot of things. A lot of questions were answered there. The one question that is the most important one out of the bunch wasn’t answered; do I really have severe depression and anxiety? 

My therapist didn’t address this and before I went to see him, I did go to a psychiatrist to get a diagnosis and was diagnosed with severe depression, severe stress and severe anxiety. 

I’m really confused now. Do I have all this and my therapist is just avoiding the whole thing to get me to heal faster or am I just wasting time going to see a therapist when my therapist thinks I don’t actually have these things?",10Oct2019,2
63,"She is a PA and I see her tomorrow. Tomorrow will be the second appointment I have with her. First appointment I will admit, I was closed off. Im not really sure why I felt that way but I behaved in a manner that was very minimalistic when it came to my answers. I didnt elaborate much and didnt really speak very freely, so I will take responsibility there.

But she also didnt ask much. Im used to having a psychiatrist go down the list of questions, like “how are you sleeping/eating/your symptoms/ect” but she didnt really do that. She asked what my “goal” was and I told her it was to get medication because I have schizoaffective disorder and I need someone to consistently prescribe it for me. She asked again what my “goal” was and I said... basically the same thing. To get medication and that I didnt really know what she meant by “goal” because I knew I wasnt ever going to be cured and I need to see someone regularly for maintenance. 

She then just said that since I didnt seem to have an opinion either way we might as well just keep with the medication I was already on. Which, Im ok with, but I was kind of expecting her to like... evaluate that herself. Maybe that is unfair of me, and maybe that is what she was trying to do with the goal question, but it just came off to me as if she didnt really know how to proceed after my answer to it. 

I then asked if she could prescribe me a stimulant and she said she would as long as I “promised” to take all the other medication. I said sure, and I have, but it just all seems sort of off to me. I guess I am just used to my doctors having an opinion on what might help me rather than me just going in and asking for different drugs. 

It was supposed to be an hour long appointment but it couldnt have been more than 10 minutes. It might just be me but... Im not sure. Maybe this is totally normal. I mean, my maintenance appointments with psychiatrists in the past have been 15-20 minutes so I know the appointments arent meant to be long... but I also have a fairly serious mental illness and Im not always the most reliable when it comes to just... dealing with it. So I would really prefer a medical provider who does know. 

I dont know if I am being unfair or not. I mean, Im sure lots of her patients look at her age and back away. But, and Im not trying to special snowflake here or anything, my condition isnt super common and she might just not have the experience with it- and Ive been “the first patient with X” condition for a mental health professional before and it didnt work out well for me.

I just want to know if I am being unfair or not? I dont want to be but its also my mental health.",10Oct2019,3
64,"My whole family is a mothafuckin mess.
They always be  fighting even under their own breath
Never get a peace of mind they all marchin to their own rhyme.


My whole family is like a goddamn timebomb. Never know what I'll say will set the other off. Please let it stop I wanna feel normal. Please don't let family fall apart

To most we look normal, a happy fam of 4. We get along in public and do normal family shit. But when the door closes it becomes the upsidedown in this bitch.

My whole family is like a goddamn timebomb. Never know what I'll say will set the other off. Please let it stop I wanna feel normal. Please don't let family fall apart

Where am I gonna go? Who am I gonna be? I'm scared to get close cuz I don't want them to know the shit that's happened to me. Please God help me. 

I know there are people worse off than me. But try to imagine having a father who's always there but isn't. Please let it be over I don't know where it'll end. Sometimes it feels like death is my only friend.

When I'm with my friends I still feel alone. Is it me? is it them? I don't really know. If they knew the shit I've done could they even be my friend?

I feel like I'm buried under a 100lbs of snow. No one's there beside me and I'm not sure where to go. I feel like I'm falling but there's no one there beside me. And that's a feeling i want no-one to know.

I feel so constricted being squeezed by the devil. If God is real how could he let this happen? I wanna fucking fight it but his grip is so chaotic. And when you feel so alone what's the point in even fighting?

As a man am I allowed to have all these fucking feelings? Is it ok I have a heart? Or should I lock it in a vault and let fucking die? Am I not allowed to feel? Am I not allowed to cry? Should I fucking bury it and hope it fucking dies?

If that's what I'm to do then why don't I just die? Is being dead on the inside the same as being dead on the outside? 

Even though they say they're my friends are they really or do they just pity? 

I don't want pity. I just wanna be me. To be accepted to feel valued to have a purpose. I put others mentality before mine. Is that right? I'd rather see my friends and family prosper than myself. Is it healthy? Is it wrong?",10Oct2019,2

I just happened to do too much on the one night I decided to do them with friends and ended up having a bad trip that left me traumatised. Long story short, I went to the hospital and they diagnosed me with paranoia and anxiety, as well as the traumatic event making my OCD 10x worse. But my main concern is what is happening right now. So I’ve always had a form of dyslexia but I’ve noticed it’s continually gotten worse from not using my brain academically and sometimes even worse when I smoked every now and then. But after this event, I’ve recently had trouble reading, writing, things are swapping with words, I try to make coffee and my brain mixes all the sequences up. Earlier I nearly put canola oil spray in my coffee cause I was also thinking of cooking eggs. But it seems to be getting worse by each day. I’ve had a brain scan and everything is normal apparently, just my mind is currently struggling to cope with mental focus, multitasking, and putting things in order. The psychiatrist said that my brain is just confused from the drugs and is trying to fix itself. Since I have a small frame and it’s shocked my brain, apparently it’ll take around 2-3 weeks.

69,"For a long time, I've been emotionally and mentally detaching myself from other people because I may or may not have some trust issues. The reason why I think I do this is because I don't want anyone to hurt me nor do I want to hurt anyone again. My lack of personal relationships has made things less heartbreaking and emotional in my personal life and it saved me a lot of pain.  
Until recently, I never realised that this is a problem. In the last year, I've been trying to build better, stronger relationships with friends and family. It hasn't been fun and I really haven't made a lot of progress in getting better. I try to get better, but I can't.   
Back in April, I visited a relative who I haven't seen in a while. I was showered with love and affection, but I guess I've built a wall so strong that I couldn't receive or give those feelings back. I wanted to cry on the spot when I realised I couldn't feel the love I was being given.   
The reason why I'm even making this post that my lack of personal relationships are reflected in my gaming style. For high school, I joined esports and the game we're playing is League of Legends. Up until a few hours ago, I was playing with teammates that I was familiar with and I have some sort of good relation with. While playing, I realised how much I sucked at LoL.   
About a hour ago when I decided to play a match solo, I was happy to find out that I was doing pretty good with my summoner which is very unusual. Unlike practice, I was getting a good amount of kills and I was trying to carry some of my teammates. We lost, but after we finished, I realised something.  
I do better without playing with anyone that I knew. I do better when I play by myself. I can do anything better and I'm better off without anyone being at my side. That match of LoL made me realised that I may be too independent and too much of a loner.  
The people that I was playing with are good friends of mine. We've known each other for years. When I was done with my match, I texted one of my friends to tell them what I needed to improve on. I had to lie to them in order to not hurt them from the sad truth.   
Honestly, this seriously breaks my heart. I can't trust anyone. I'm not going to be able to feel the 'love' that many people receive and give. The worst part is that I try to get better and all I do is miserably fail. I try to better myself every day for nothing. I want to feel love and know what it's like to trust someone again. But I can't. It frightens and saddens me that I might remain like this for the rest of my life.",10Oct2019,5

75,"I like to think of myself as a very self aware person, I contemplate my actions and thoughts and I’m aware of the habits I have. 

I’m going to be as direct as possible in how I explain my mental state. 

To put in bluntly: I feel fake. Empty or hallow might be a better way of wording it, I feel like I wear a facade around people and it tires me out. I don’t feel emotionally attached to people, including my family. People feel like a burden to me to interact with. Empathy is not something I can say I understand, it feels illogical and cumbersome. I make friends easily enough, but they could drop off the face of the earth and I’d carry on like usual. Friends are just strangers you know a little more about and possibly share a few common interests. This may stem from when I moved frequently with my family as a child and I never got the chance to hold onto anyone for too long, but that’s just my hypothesis. 

I’m bored, constantly, I hop from game to game and from activity to activity. I rarely feel satisfied with my time and each day feels like another wasted step towards our inevitability. I picked up an optimistic nihilistic outlook on life, kind of a “life has no meaning but it’s my job to make myself happy till I die” thing. 

I’ve notice that I am a liar, and a manipulator. I lie like I breath, and embellish the smallest things in stories I tell. I have created a web of lies, and I’m fully aware of my creation. I’m not sure when or where I learned to lie on the fly and remember said lie weeks or months after it. I think that, among other things, I might be a pathological liar. I try to usually only lie when it’s either convenient or can’t have a negative outcome, like making small talk with a stranger. 

I’ve often been called sadistic and cold as seeing others in pain is enjoyable. I just sum it up as schadenfreude. My ex used to tell me I have a “face you don’t want to mess with, not because you’re scary but because you walk with empty eyes. Like a resting bitch face but more with a dehumanizing glance”. (Paraphrased). I don’t outwardly show many emotions unless I’m actively attempting to.

76,"(this is my first ever reddit post so this is new and I hope this doesn't come off as bitching I'm completely ok with what I go through) So I haven't had a ""good nights sleep"" since I was about 5 or 6 that's around the time my nightmares flarred into every night occurrences to which I have responded with a utter hatred of sleep. IK its important for the mind to shutdown into the dream state anf your body to heal at this time,  but I deeply despise sleep for my constant night terrors and sleep paralysis. And me being a shy kid with ADHD and already having to deal with side effects of that medication (meds making me feel depressed or having side effects that ended up with me feeling depressed (now I can identify the feeling back then I didn't know how to describe or express my feelings and emotions and still struggle with that))  I didn't seek help and only until I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and a attempt did my mother hear why I had issues with sleep (and many other things ig). I usually don't sleep and if I do its because I passed out from complete exhaustion. The one problem with living like that is the longer I'm awake the worse the hallucinations (auditory, physical, and visual) I suffer from become especially past the first day,  to the point if I'm up for more than 3 days it becomes nonstop and worse than the night terrors I'm trying to avoid. I've been diagnosed with insomnia just like my mother now and it might be due to the straight fear I have for sleep, the restlessness and energetic behavior of my ADHD, genetics, or even a combination with all of these. When I do sleep I usually have a nightmare or a sleep paralysis episode and rarely just don't have a dream at all. When I finally sleep I hear my surroundings and can wake myself up and respond to people while dreaming which I find funny ig. I really don't expect anyone to see this or care..I'm more documenting my own thoughts and don't wish for any advice although I won't stop you. I use my experiences in my poetry, comedy, helping of others, etc. and don't wish to change my perspective from what it is or change my past.

However the many hours I had to travel to school burned me out so I got out and went to a regular old high school much, much closer to where I lived. After that I moved abroad for 2 years, where I started and finished A levels with A B and another B after starting my first year late in February. As we came back home I was told that my levels is useless in my country and I essentially wasted 2 years. So I enrolled into an online school which I could do from home and then proceeded to not do anything.

I for some reason find it extremely difficult to do anything productive at home a when I'm not restricted to certain activities. Of course sometimes I get into the groove for a week or two, but as soon as I get a little bored, my attention wanders and I begin procrastinating again. This of course meant that my studies weren't progressing and I kept missing deadlines. Now I'm basically about to have to do it all over, wasting further time. Throughout all this I've been lying to basically everyone around me about how things are going because of my previous results setting me up as a smart guy. I also know I can finish my work but I literally can't bring myself to do it.

Any time I could potentially lose face I end up lying. From just small things like a story about a friend to how I'm doing in school, which is probably about to get me in insane trouble. Now I practically hate myself because I feel like I can't bring myself to stop lying or tend to my responsibilities.

Now if I do get called out or disturbed in my misery, I get very angry really fast, I'm super irritable and now I can't even enjoy my procrastination either since even the video games make me angry. So I'm all around miserable and I have no clue what to do. I've lost interest in my music and dance hobbies as well. 

Well, that's pretty much it. I am aware of my problems but I feel powerless to fix them. To anyone who read this, thanks, I guess. It just felt good to write it down. Have a good one.

PS. If you want details I'd be happy to talk. I've been needing to talk to someone anyway.",10Oct2019,3
78,"I don't know if this is the right sub to post this, but here I go. It's something I shouldn't really care about, but this question keeps haunting me, how the hell does someone just ""gets over"" their crippling mental disorders and changes their personality by doing nothing? Every story I hear online about people beating depression has something to do with therapy, drugs, working out, eating well, all that stuff, but mine was different.

To give context, growing up I was a quiet kid with zero sense of self-worth, started having depression around 10~11 years old and it all got worse from there. I guess the only positive things about my childhood were that my parents were okay and I never got bullied. My lowest point was when I started having panic attacks at 15 and had to quit school because of it. That completely destroyed me, it made me think I was a dysfunctional sack of shit destined to suicide. From then on I spent my time locked in my room all day, completely lost playing video games, watching anime and jerking off, waiting to get kicked out of the house for being a useless freeloader and finally kill myself, but after about a couple years (not sure when exactly) something changed. My disorders were gone before I could notice anything (and there wasn't much to notice since I was alone in my room all the time). This is where I think there might be something fucked up in my head, several other aspects of my personality changed drastically, I started feeling very ""alive"" and confident (like never before), my sense of morality, responsibility, empathy and self-image became weak and unstable, I completely lost my need to socialize and showed minimized emotional reactions, but I was happy on the inside and stopped taking things seriously. Then I just moved on with my new life, still feeling kinda mental.

I don't know if this affects anything, but even in my worst moments I refused to believe that I had any mental illness (except for panic attacks, those were hard to ignore), in my head I was just ""figuring things out"", all while being a socially-crippled suicidal depressed zombie. Absolutely delusional stuff, but maybe it had something to do with the change?

This was years ago. Recently I watched Joker (good movie btw) and it reminded me of this chaotic ""unsolved"" past, so here I am. It looks like my curiosity and feeling of alienation will never let this rest. I mean, it would suck to live the rest of my life without knowing how I escaped death and became a different kind of ""mental"" (I don't know what else to call it). Looking back, I don't think I ever felt like a full human being before noticing these changes, it doesn't even feel like I'm the same person, it's like some pathetic depressed guy died and I took his body and memories for myself. Maybe I experienced some life-changing psychosis? PTSD? Brain damage? 

Are there any cases like this one? Sorry if this all reads like crazy talk.",10Oct2019,1
79,"A little background about me: I'm a female, 30 years old, working in a job that it's nice enough for me, but it's not my passion.

The thing is that I feel that I'm happy, and that happiness is something like a joy inside of me (deep inside of me). But sometimes, some days, life gets so hard that I can't help feeling down and lack of strength, and I start feeling really lonely (because I think that in dark places we're alone, no matter how many people is around you, you're just alone), and it gets weird for me, because I feel that the happiness  that I have  inside of me is not enough to fight those dark moments.... and how do I get to those dark moments?? Most of the times because of something out of my control that affects my life (for example: illness) but sometimes it happens also that this darkness come inside of me some of the times.

I don't know if this belong here, and I don't know if this makes any sense at all, it's just that right now I'm in one of the dark moments  and I needed to write about it.

Who make us err, and make us weep

They have us toss and turn at night

The first prevents you being your best

Just before the biggest test

Or in your car, oh look you've stalled

Anxiety is what its called


The next will strike when you cant cope

It scars your soul, and takes all hope

When lacking sleep it plays its game

Depression is its ghastly name


So how to fight this deadly pair

Use these tools see how you fair

Mindfulness, and ABC

They sometimes work and both are free

But basically last night I thought I had to be in uni tomorrow for 9am, for a 1 hour talk but it turns out I had to be in for 10 for a whole day workshop. This change in plan completely through me off and I had an anxious meltdown and I couldn’t stop crying about it. So basically I decided I couldn’t go  at all so I have taken the whole day off, so I’ve missed out on a workshop and getting other work done because I could cope with the change in plan. This isn’t the first time this has happened and I do tent to miss out on things because things aren’t the norm or a plan changes.

Last week I found out I was pregnant in spite of starting birth control. I am miscarrying, this is my 5th early miscarriage of 2019. 

I feel like I have finally snapped. I have psoriasis which has flared up all over my body causing much pain and itchiness. I'm not sleeping well. 

I have been experiencing episodes of chest tightening, I feel like I can't get a full breath of air and I feel incredibly disoriented and dizzy. I am not remembering anything. I can't focus. I have went to change my son's diaper and discovered he already had a fresh diaper on meaning I had just changed him. I left the burner on my gas stove on for 7 hours yesterday. I have begun to have suicidal thoughts.

93,"Hello, (19 F) here. I am struggling to understand what's happening to me. For the past 3 months I've had no desire to speak to any of my friends/acquaintances/etc. I am close with my mom so I still talk to her, plus we live in different countries and I worry about her and keep asking myself all sorts of questions about her (Is she okay? Is she still alive? etc.) I have already lost my dad, and ever since then I've always made it a point to appreciate every single moment I have with my mom. But I digress. 

At this stage, I don't feel like I miss any of my friends. We were closer than ever, talking on the phone (group calls) for up to 6 hours a day even on schooldays, but now I just feel nothing towards them. Something similar happened before, but it wasn't quite so strong. I went through a very tough period in my life, and didn't speak to anyone for 2 months. When I got better, I messaged everyone, and it was extremely easy to get back into texting them because nobody made it hard for me. They were all so welcoming and happy to have me back, and none of them asked difficult or invasive questions as they know I don't like that. Now, nothing in particular is going on that's making life hard for me, other than the daily little mishaps everyone goes through. I would say I'm not in a terrible place, and I don't feel depressed or suicidal. Some major changes are ahead of me in a couple of months, but this has been going on for 3 whole months, seemingly for no reason. 

It was all too sudden, I just didn't have the desire to talk anymore. I've never been that kind of person, I've always been quick to respond, excited to talk to my friends, I was so close with them all that I brought them together, and was the ""mom"" friend of everyone.

I was living in a stable house with my housemates, work was stable, I was alright with handling school work etc, but I was fucking miserable. Constantly had panic attacks, couldn't leave the house cause of how anxious I was, had very obsessive and disturbing thought patterns, regularly had disassociation and depersonolization and etc. 

I got better and better throughout this year but I was still like the shell of the person I used to be by the start of this school year. Now that I started school, I don't have a place to stay, work is a fucking mess, meaning I have to work up to 8 hours a day from 2 last year, I don't understand a word spoken in lectures, had problems with most of my friends and do not see them anymore but I am perfectly fine. I feel great mentally. No more obsessive thoughts, at all! Having great sleep every night, no depressive thoughts or any symptoms really. But... why? What could have caused this seemingly perfect recovery? I am a bit iffy as I think I could be supressing some stuff but I also don't care as long as I am alright.

I had no idea until people at my new job started making the same comments. I got suspicious and looked at her FB friends and comments and sure enough she’s besties with one of the people that were in the clique. The girl that’s training me is the one whose been there the longest so she’s kind of in that position above everyone else.

TL;DR does anyone have any tips on how I can prepare to make my CBT sessions successful? If you're in (or have been through) this process, what do you do that leads to helpful conversation?

Some context that became me venting is written below:

I just started CBT and I'm having a lot of trouble with it. Now, I've only had 2 sessions (but they're definitely not cheap, and my mental health is so poor I had to quit work) but I feel like they're not going productively enough for me to be OK with spending this much money on them. So far it's my therapist asking me questions and I can only respond ""I don't know"" or they point out thought distortions that I recognize are there, but we can't come up with believable thoughts to combat it.

I'm playing around with CBT apps to get an idea of how this is supposed to work, but I feel like I'm not getting it. I'm having trouble ""putting a voice to the negative thoughts"" because it's just all noise or random thoughts that I can't figure out (or can't really remember in reflection). I also realize there's no use worrying about 99% of the things I worry about, but the advice is always ""don't worry so much about that"" but if I don't worry or think about it, then I can't problem solve? Repressing things just doesn't seem healthy either.

I want this to stop and I want to be a functional human, but I feel like I'm seriously missing something. I know it's a therapist's job to guide me through this, but we're all only human and I'm a huge mess, so if there's anything I can do, I want to do it.

It’s a weird feeling where your convinced that everyone around u just had preprogrammed things to say to u and after that they stop living. Im not sure if this is something to bring up with my therapist or if this is a normal thing.

Another thing is sometimes the world goes 2D. Like the sound. It’s like standing between 2 TVs and they’re both playing different things. It’s very flat sounding.

Any help would be appreciated. I’ve been finding out a lot of things I thought were normal, weren’t.",10Oct2019,2

Whose honest tale details his addiction, spirituality, and recovery

Appeals most to those struggling to make a stand

Against the demons inside trying to make the world shadowy

Western Society’s only now catching on 

To the opening of Pandora’s Box

That happened simultaneously alongside this drive toward science over religion

And abandoned the fatherless sons who still feel lost

&amp;#x200B;

I feel it when I see my GP

I know from his embarrassed face

Something unarticulated doesn’t allow him to be 

Empathetic or kind to those he sees as base

&amp;#x200B;

The mission is simple: Don’t Be A Dick 

Raise awareness wherever you can 

So that those who find themselves in a bit of a ditch 

Are extended a warm, gentle, kind hand 

Not a look downwards or an anxious mind 

A calm serene gift that’s so hard to find 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll say it again: Don’t Be A Dick 

Be free with your mind and meditate 

Maybe then you’ll see: we’re not playing a trick

117,"Hey guys, 
I’m new to this sub, and not quite sure how things work, but I’d like to offer some support to those young people and anyone for that matter who need it. I myself (19 yrs old) have been going through depression the last 5 years and this year past I finally reached out for help and I’m loving life. I’ve set up an Instagram page this year to provide support and share my story, I won’t share it as of yet as I don’t know if it is allowed.
Don’t be afraid to hmu if you would like to hear my opinions on some topics. Also I can share my Instagram if anyone would like (if it is allowed of course)

118,"Hi, I made a post earlier about today being Mental Health and I want to talk about anxiety and hear your stories. 

I used to puke all the time when before my panic attacks, and it took me looooooong time to realize the patterns. 

What I've realized is that my gut and probably yours too if you deal with anxiety, fucks with you. You're either constipated or puking or pooping too much. And you're then drained because of all this. 

I've worked hard towards keeping my gut healthy and I thought doing so would reduce my nausea and thereby, reduce my restlessness and anxiety.

Something I had tried before meds. Tried probiotics, had black coffee everyday, and loads of fruits with fibre and water content. 

Also kept a diary recording when I puked.

I feel like a lot of people like me just need someone to relate to and to tell them everything is going to be ok. If you have the time today I will be uploading ep 3 at 12:30 pm est. The show also has a playlist for the music lovers that is on Apple Music if you want to listen to that as well. Last but not least just please let me know what I’m doing good or what I’m doing bad because I wanna know everything , the good , the bad and the ugly.

Prior to our relationship I went through 4/5 years of mental health breakdowns with agrophobia depression panic phobias, etc. My partner experienced my recovery from this. Late stages of therapy getting over the occasional panics, he learned all about it from me he had no experience with it before. I couldn't ask for a more patient and loving person to support me through this. 

Over the past 6 months there has been a slow up and down but mostly down hill with my mental health. Today I hit breaking point. I had a full agrophobic panic attack where the thought of stepping foot outside the door was terrifying. I quit my job, getting signed off for the month of my notice by the gp. 

My partner was there for it all. I dont think he ever saw me or anyone is such a state before. He was quiet, eerily quiet after it all. I never known him to be such a closed person. When I try to talk about it he brush it off as fine.

130,"Hi, just joined recently. I know that I have a problem but I really don't know what it is or exactly how to describe it. I understand I could go to the doctor for it, but its really hard to do with my job. Since it takes mental health into consideration. I find myself enjoying daydreaming far more then reality, I can distinguish the two and switch rather quickly but find little joy in the later. I don't know if i'm depressed as I don't feel sad, but I also find most of my emotions mute and rather chaotic in a sense. Some days ill feel lonely, but others I really enjoy being alone. Same even with my empathy, some days I don't feel a thing for the people around me others I contemplate if not saying hello to my neighbor had ruined his day and feel rather bad about it. I know I have anxiety but it comes and goes as does my mood. However even with this, the spikes and lows are very close together rather mute in fact. I can tell the differences, but it doesn't feel like it should. I have felt this way since a young child, but my mother believed mental health could be changed by attitude so i put away the thoughts. Mental illness runs on her side of the family but in her view its just because they didn't have the mental fortitude. My family has always been very big on wearing masks and your current attitude is what you should feel. So if I show myself happy, eventually the mask will reflect what i feel inside. I don't know if i have gotten good enough that it fools even me? Since if I need to, i can change the mask I wear and somewhat feel like how i'm pretending to be. I will feel rather tired afterwards however. On rare rare occasions probably 1-2 times a year it feels as if the mask falls and everything rushes me. All the anger, sadness and even joy that I should have been feeling the whole year all at once. My anxiety sky rockets and I cant do anything for the whole day. I usually experience migraines at times like this and would get them as a kid since this phenomenon has happened since my early teens. I don't feel like i'm actively suppressing it, it feels as if it falls away afterwards and i'm back to whatever i was doing before hand, just a bit more tired. If anyone has felt this way or understands it at all I would appreciate the help.",10Oct2019,1

132,"Hey,

I don't want to self-diagnose. I don't immediately want to assume that what I'm going through is a 'disorder', an illness. But, generally, I don't feel okay.

I'm constantly tired, I can't focus, I don't have the will to care about school - not as much as I should, not like I used to. I recently realised that i'm withdrawing myself from 'friends'. I feel isolated - I've got noone to speak to about this. I couldn't care less about petty issues and dramas at school, they don't matter. Nobody focuses on anything substantial.
I'm not as happy as I once was.

I guess I've been living like this for the last year. I just assumed this was normal, until a distant friend said that he felt the same - he goes to therapy. I didn't want to try and compare my life to his. I never tell anyone the extent though; I can't put that weight on them. I hate asking for help, I don't want to be melodramatic or needy. I don't want anyone to feel their problems are insignificant, because we all have problems.

But, please. 
I just need someone to speak to, I want somebody to understand.

I interned for the company before for a whole year and they loved me to bits during my first stay. Even though it was a huge move forward in my career, I started off by feeling uninspired, and right now i believe im on a verge of termination.

Anyways, I am extremely lonely, I eat properly every other day and barely sleep at night and yesterday I had a very vivid night terror (this is a rare but memorable occurence for me). The weird part is, when I woke up I was convinced that there was a demonic presence in my house and that it is seeping into me through some cursed item in my possession. Now, i have a graduate degree in a hard (hard) science and my philosophical outlook has always been firmly rooted in logical positivism and derivations thereof. And here I am, 3 am, scuffling through my stuff to find a cursed item. Gradually, I came to my senses and went back to sleep. Is this how psychosis starts? Should I check into a mental ward?

***; - A semicolon is used when an author could have chosen to end their sentence but chose not to. The author is you and the sentence is your life.***  
I’ve struggled with mental health since I was around 13. It was always shrugged off as ‘teenage hormones’ back when cutting yourself became a fashion statement in high school. Others would try to accentuate their cuts with neon gloves, me, I didn’t give enough of shit to hide them, and no one ever paid enough attention to notice.   
I wouldn’t say I’ve had the easiest upbringing, nor would I say I’ve had it the worst. But when I had to be removed by police for my ‘own safety’ when I was 16 and I lost my friends, my family, my home and everything - that really fucked me up.   
I’ve never been the type of person who can hide my emotions, I am not blessed with a poker face. I’m very reactive and when I feel an emotion, I feel it with every sinew in my body, whether that be happy, angry or depressed. When I’m happy, it’s like I’ve eaten too much sugar and I will bounce off the walls, and in general, I think I’m an alright person to be around – apart from being super annoying. When I’m angry, I will break things, I will lash out and think about the consequences later. When I’m depressed, the world just opens up and swallows me whole and I struggle to find a way out that doesn’t involve me sticking my middle finger up to the world and kissing it goodbye.   
Looking back now, what sparked my downward spiral where I finally took things into my own hands seems silly. It was a culmination of many, many bad years and unresolved anger. For starters, I already think I am an absolutely horrible person. I tell my self it every day, along with the fact that I am fat, ugly, boring and I have no purpose in life. I’ve already convinced my self I don’t want marriage or children because well, who would want me? Not after a pity party, just trying to give you an idea of how I already feel on a daily basis when I’m feeling ‘normal’.  
Now imagine having all of that screamed at you by someone you thought was a friend, just because you tried to do the right thing and not lead him on? Turns out I was just a convenient fuck for him, nothing more, nothing less. Having all of that acknowledged out loud by someone, my stomach just dropped. Like, shit, I really am horrible, I thought it was just the depression talking, but wow. If I really am that bad, maybe I should just do everyone a favour and end it all? I coolly collect my things as he drives me back to my previous residence which I left due to yet another ‘friend’ who used to steal my things when I wasn’t there. On the ride back, I’d already decided what I was going to do, I even did my make up on the way because I wanted to look pretty for Satan when I inevitably arrived in hell. I got my bags, went to one corner shop, bought all the paracetamol I could from there, went to another corner shop, did the same, and one more shop just for good measure. The next stop, the pub, swallowed about 15 pills in succession on my way there, got to the bar and chased them all down with a double JD and coke. Went to the bathroom and took another 20+ plus, I felt smug, like I was finally going to do some good in the world, I was convinced this was the right thing to do. Back to the bar, ordered another double JD and coke and went outside to have a cig whilst I took the remaining, I think 15-20?  
Next, was the hardest thing I think I have ever had to do. I text my Mum. ‘I’m sorry, I love you x’ and she replied ‘Love you too x’ she had no idea, absolutely no idea what I had just done and what I was still determined to accomplish. It didn’t take long for the shakes to start, whether it was because the pills had kicked in or if it was because my body realised what I had just done. My limbs began to spasm, my stomach began to try and force me to throw up, - years of practice of the tactical chunder I managed to keep everything in. A guy came outside with his dog for a cig, he looked me up and down and I’m guessing I wasn’t looking too healthy. He finished his cig and went back inside. A few minutes later, an ambulance crew turns up for me, asks me if I’m ok, have I taken anything, asked me the usual name, date of birth, etc… I have no idea why, but I actually laughed when I told them how many pills I had taken like I was proud, smug that they were too late and they couldn’t save me.   
Little did I know, paracetamol takes days to kills you as it shuts down your organs. As you can imagine, I was taken to hospital, stomach pumped and was kept in a big white room which only served to cause a panic attack as it dawned on me what had just happened. Was this white room representative of the padded cell I was more than likely going to end up in?   
Nope! A few hours later, the depressive episode had passed and I was sat in front of a Mental Health Nurse, laughing about it all! (I was, he wasn’t), psych assessment seemingly passed, I was discharged and ended up with the man I then spent nearly 4 years of my life with.   
The following day, I finally got back in contact with my mum. I went down to see her, she asked questions, and when I tried to explain what happened, how it came about and how I felt. My mother shared a glance with my stepdad and they laughed… that hurt more than any insult or hit I have ever had thrown at me.   
I can laugh about my own suicide attempt now and the fact I can’t even kill myself right! I still struggle with this to this day, though I have better coping mechanisms. Complete isolation, games, reading, drawing, alcohol, self-deprecating comment and suicide jokes – I didn’t say they were healthy! But they help me channel the energy in a less life-threatening way…  
I know this is about suicide prevention, but dealing with an attempt is just as important. When someone who you know has struggled with mental health for years, has tried all the medication, has tried the therapy, has tried exercise, going outside and eating all of the vegetables and doing all of the things you ‘should’ do. When someone who trusted you, who you should love unconditionally, comes up to you and tells you they tried to end it all because they felt it was the best thing to do for everyone around them, don’t call them selfish, don’t laugh at them when they try to describe how they felt. Don’t turn it around on yourself, don’t say you don’t want to talk about it because it ‘hurts’ you.   
Depression isn’t a feeling that is easily described with words. Everyone has their own version of it. If you want an idea of what depression is like? Google ‘Depression’ and hit images. Try and describe those images as an emotion, and listen to how crazy you sound.   
It takes a lot of pain and self-loathing to be pushed to the point you want to take your own life. I’d like to think, that if anyone ever felt like that – friend, family, colleague – you could come to me. Knowing that I do have some understanding of how you feel, I would not judge, I would be impartial and I would wait it out with you. There is always someone out there willing to help you, you just need to find the right people worth your time.",10Oct2019,3
136,"It’s like a cloud settles over my brain. I can’t concentrate, I struggle to focus on anything outside of myself. It’s like my senses are dulled and I’m experiencing the world through frosted glass (I can see perfectly but the best way I can explain how it feels). It’s like I have to force my consciousness outside this frosted glass box, but it keeps trying to return inside me instead (metaphorically, I don’t actually think this is happening!) This can happen for a day or a week at a time. Sometimes I can shift it by pretty much forcing myself to engage properly with everything around me. I think exercise helps but I’m not sure if I just *think* it does.",10Oct2019,1
137,"So, just a few moments ago, I´ve had a phone call with my mom. She kept insulting me about how uncaring I am, about how I´ve lost my job because of my inactivity, and ton´s of other stuff, just chastising me the entire time. The only thing true about me is that I procrastinate a lot. But to tell me that I´m lazy just because I´ve went to see a movie the day before I was supposed to give a presentation? I wanted to let some steam off. I was so nervous and on edge that I´ve had to escape it all for two hours. 

At the end of the phone call, I started crying like a little baby. Just when my mom was about to hang up, I started laughing. Just laughing loudly like a maniac. And even through I should feel ashamed of myself and my life decisions... I just have to laugh at the absurdity my life has become. It´s like it´s a big joke. Something in me tells me that I shouldn´t be laughing, that something is wrong with me, that it´s all my fault that my life is so awful, and that I should end it all (suicide). But something else in me tells me that it´s all okay and that nothing really matters. That something else is also telling me that I shouldn´t be bothered that my family hates me, that I shouldn´t be bothered by the fact my girlfriend is seriously considering a breakup, that something else tells me that I should laugh and enjoy this shitty life that I have, to make it as amazing as possible. 

And now, my mom called me again, telling me that she might be able to take me to visit my girlfriend next weekend (we are in a long distance relationship and I wasn´t able to visit her for the last 4 months due to my bad time schedule). She asked me if I´m alright, and I was just laughing the entire time. 

Is this normal? Am I going mad? Or am I completely okay and it´s just one really bad day?

You know, maybe Joker was right that all it takes is just one bad day to drive a man insane.",10Oct2019,2

Last Year (7th Grade) i got into a fight and the other kid spread false rumors on that i said horiible stuff about a dying family member of his. I got Assaulted in the Hallway which just led to more mental pain. I got home and all that was on social media was people who told me to kill my self and spreading these rumors farther. I had so much stress i couldnt go to school anymore so i did online school and it was terrible so this year i started the State Charter School and it has been making it worse.My parents have done so much for me and i feel absolutely terrible for having them go through this. I lost a lot of friends because i was scared how they will think of me. I want to go back to school but all i feel is pain and ive spent the whole year with terrible school anxiety. My dog and Grandma died this year and i just hope if i can find a way to do school i can finally be happy again since ive been suicidal since January but to scared to hurt the ones who love me to actually do it.

147,"Hey all -- today is World Mental Health Day. I know I don't know you and you don't know me, but I just wanted to check in with you -- how are you doing? What are you feeling right now?

148,"I realized how emotionally unstable I am since few years ago. I’ve always thought that if I’m emotionally stable, I could’ve gotten better grades and I could be in better place than now. But there are many times I struggle a lot. There were phases where I would cry every night and being unable to get out of my bed. There was also times when I had terrible anxiety attacks and had to go to the doctor. I went to see a counselor, and it was ok until one session where she made me roleplay a situation where I had a misunderstanding with my friend. I ended up not knowing what to do and was nervous at that time, and my counselor told me that my inner self wasn’t really resolved. She told me that it’s up to me to find out how to deal with my emotions- but that’s the thing! How? I changed counselors four times already (twice because I moved from high school to college, then changed counselor once.) but I still never find a way to deal with my inner self. I always avoided being vulnerable with others. I avoided serious conversation with my friends because I would have nervous breakdown.

And now I feel like I’m always distant from people and don’t have anyone to depend to. Not only that, again, I realized how better I could have been now if my emotions are stable. I would be able to balance my studies, social life and work. But now I’m freaking out over me being unable to answer my last quiz correctly because I was occupied with my part-time job. I’m a psychology student, and I was actually going to go for clinical psychology. But now I’m not going to and choose other path because I know I’m not ready for it.

151,"On Monday I told my school counselor I was going to kill myself by the end of the week, or at least felt like I didn't want to live any longer. We talked over my issues and how I feel like this every month. But this month none of my tricks to help me out were working. He asked me what I usually do and I said listen to music, he asked me a song and began to play it on YouTube. He said he loved it. Idk but hearing someone say they value my interests was very nice and reassuring. I'm gonna show him some of my drawings too on Friday. Speaking of Friday, this also saved my life. 

I had scheduled my next appointment with him for this Friday. But another secretary said he had that time blocked off. He had a meeting from 9:30-11:30 and he wouldn't be open till next week. So I said I didn't know when I'd be available next, and told her I'd get back to her. Yesterday waiting for my mom to pick me up we bump into each other and I told him Friday got canceled because he has his meeting. He said ""You know what? Come here."" We go to the counseling office and he talks to the secretary. He usually stays at the meetings till noon, wrapping up project ideas and talking to people. He says ""Open up 11:30, I'll just tell them I have an appointment and I'll run over here. No big deal."" Thinking about it makes me wanna cry. He's so nice! 

Honestly he and my high school psych teacher have helped me so much with depression and suicide. Theres a love in Greek called ""Philia"" which is love for your friends. The Greeks believed this love could be more powerful than even romantic love. And that's how I feel. I love these guys so deeply but people misconstrue it to be a weird way. But it's not like that at all. These guys just saved my life.

I’ve recently got a new job role within education and we had to do an interactive training day. 2 years ago this would have resulted in me freaking out and trying to get out of the room somehow/ being sick. Today I found some inner strength and participated. Not only that- I was vocal, involved myself in discussions and stood at the front conducting a micro lesson in a room full of professionals. Half way through my session I completely froze and for one split second I felt that anxiety rise and tap me on the shoulder.

160,"Well hate is a strong word.
Dislikes me. 

I know how this sounds. I am not a paranoid, as I can tell from my friends and surroundment. Hear me out.

I am going for almost two months on a group therapy, and its mostly people with anxiety avoidant and borderline personality disorder. I have both of them. There are two main psychotherapists in a group, and both are women. Second one is only comming to cover first one when she is sick. I love the second one because she is having healthy, analytic approach and goes into deep really deep. She has healthy emotional departure from all of the patients and uses a lot of cognitive behavioral approach and is very scientific.

First one, main one, plays on a card of an emphaty. And this is where problems starts. As borderline personality is more common to be diagnosed in women, I am as a man in minority, odds 1:8. She often said she is a mother and wife, she empathises and listens with most of the mothers in the group, that would be half of it. She also empathises with women who had any kind of an abuse. I myself suffered from an abuse through whole childhood, i would not talk about nature of it, it was serious abuse, some former psychiatrists diagnosed me with ptsd, but never put it in my diagnosis (in my country cptsd is not still recognised). But I dont feel she thinks its the same kind of abuse.

Why do I think this? For many reasons. Often after therapy other patients stay with her that she can change their therapy, mostly patients who are loud in group, who already connected with her on deeper level as they are there for six months and more. Yes, they are mostly female and mostly mothers. When I approached her to change my meds I feel she felt threatened by me. I dont look like a threat, mostly people say I have approachable, friendly face. In the group, when I start to talk she rolls her eyes, and often ignores me watching in other direction, or start to talk with other patients. 

After a group some members have coffee. It is not recomendable, but it happens. Most of them said she was empathetic and warm and kind to them. I dont feel like that at all. I feel she doesnt like me when I talk, doesnt want to listen to me, and her face expression goes into gloom when she eye contacts me. 

I really feel uncomfortable about talking about myself, not because of patients, but because of her. I genuinly feel she dislikes me, but it is public hospital, and she cannot do nothing about it. She cannot say it in any way, the same way teacher cannot say he/she dislikes one of his/her students.

But I dont feel that with any of the patients. Most of the patients did accepted me, or are just too deep in their problems that they even think about me. Even nurses accepted me. And the chance second therapist come back to the group is really small.

I do look after myself very well by eating right, working out and dressing well and I have a large group of friends... so I am not socially inept but I just do not know why women still wont have sex with me. Either women's standards are just too high or I am just ugly... some guys are just plain ugly I suppose.

My friends have told me to find a girlfriend but I said it would be wrong to lie and get in to a relationship with a woman just for sex (I only just need a release or have my sexual needs met). I chronically masturbate a lot but it does not do anything like sex does. The only thing that has worked for me in the past (when I had money) is paying for it directly (escort service) but the huge downside to it is how much it breaks the bank, which is not financially sustainable for the majority of men unless you're wealthy.

180,"Hi, 

My partner (M27) and I (M25) broke up about 1 and a half months ago. 

He broke up with me after a series of sad talks and distrust. He pushed me to a point of thinking I might have to end things when he touched another man’s penis (this man went on to be his friend) and let him touch his. He kept it from me for 2 months and claims that it was buried under all of our fights so he never told me (I hung out with him and this guy completely oblivious). As crazy as it all sounds, and as much as it seemed like cheating... I still didn’t want to see it that way. 

I wanted to believe and trust my partner. Even though I was very disturbed by it all and didn’t like that he wanted to keep this guy in his life. At the time of this incident, they only knew each other for a bit 2 weeks or so and it happened during a conversation about circumcision when I wasn’t present.

Don’t get me wrong.. I wasn’t perfect. I was jealous most of the time. Didn’t like when guys hit on my boyfriend or followed him to bar bathrooms(Normal reaction I’d think) but I’d get upset and he ended up feeling like he was being criticized for going to bars. Funny thing is I loved going to the bars with him and going out to dance. 

I also read his texts 6 months in (somewhat by mistake) and saw some previous texts exchanged between him and this guy he slept with the day we met. My ex didn’t reciprocate any flirty talk, but this guy was very flirtatious in the texts. Said things like “aw baby, sorry you’re feeling this way. I wish I could be there to hug you”.

Anyway, they stopped talking but it ate at me and I let my jealousy show and it came off as controlling. This made him trust me less after coming clean about this. 

I can’t help but feel like I fucked up my relationship. I also freaked out when he wanted to move to another neighborhood (it just meant I had a longer train ride to him). So I wasn’t as supportive as he would have liked either...

I let the jealousy rob me of joy in my relationship. Now that it’s over.. I miss him. I love him still and I feel sometimes like I can’t live anymore. The pain gets to be unbearable and so it makes me want to give up on life. My mental health is really declining and I feel like I’m in constant suffering and self blame. 

The little reminders of him that the world throws at me hurts me so much at times.

What can I do? I’m already in therapy... I just feels like nothing can help me. 

Tldr; My boyfriend broke up with me even though we talked about building our lives together. I was very jealous and he did things that stresses me out. I feel like giving up on life. Like dying at times. What do iI do?",10Oct2019,2

184,"in honor of world mental health day i thought i’d write a little essay on why mentally ill people should be allowed to refuse treatment. this is just a rough draft, i might come back to his later.

i don’t know about other countries but here in the US people are allowed to have in involuntarily commuted to a psych hospital if they think you are a harm to yourself or others. i think that’s a bit unfair. if someone has cancer, they don’t have to accept chemotherapy. parents don’t have to give their kids life-saving vaccines (even if they have dumb reasons, it’s their right). most medical professionals would agree it’s unethical to force treatment on a patient. especially since no treatment is 100% safe. they always have risks. however, if someone has depression, we can just throw them in a hospital, no questions asked? the exact criteria (which is set by the state not psychologists, which to me is just as ridiculous as insurance companies setting the average BMI instead of doctors) is that “you must present a danger” but the thing is most mentally ill people aren’t dangerous. and at least those aren’t the ones in hospitals. the problem is mental health is still fairly new. there are treatments from the ‘50s we now know are ridiculous - like lobotomies on autistic children - and there are things that were considered illnesses that we now know are not - like being gay. 

involuntary treatment is just an excuse for neurotypicals to discriminate. they don’t have to understand the illness because anytime they feel concerned, they can just call the police and have them committed. but any psychologist will know that treatment alone doesn’t help. the need outside support as well.

involuntary treatment can also be used against mentally ill people, because you can just threaten to “lock them up” any time they do something you don’t like.

the only time involuntary treatment should be allowed is if you commit a serious crime and plead insanity, because then it’s not involuntary, you chose that over prison. 

but right now, you can force treatment on mentally ill people. you can lock them up for have mental illnesses. it’s like it’s a crime to be mentally ill, a crime that our society finds more heinous than rape (because there are rapists who don’t even get a year, while mentally ill people might be in the psych hospital their whole life)",10Oct2019,4

No way. If there was a way out, I wouldn't have to be writing this but there isn't. Life doesn't always get better. That's a fact. 

Therapy didn't do anything at all. And I know that it won't. No one can help me and I can't help myself. 

""even if you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, it gets better"" just because, in your life  it got better. Well I'm not like you, because it won't get better - that's the difference.

I've been fucked from the start. The root problem is that I should never have been born. You can't rectify that. 

This is based on facts. Life hasn't got better at all; it's gotten absolutely , exponentially, 100x worse.  So all evidence supports my conclusion. Life will only get worse from here because that's how the trend has gone so far.

Hi guys,

I have a bit of problem i've been struggling with for years now. It's really difficult focusing on reading for a long period of time and even worse when it's academic related because I end up cramming/memorizing without ever understanding.

I am a photographer and couldn't figure out photoshop or a camera till someone put me through the basics in a day. It became easier for me to learn off youtube and other online educational resource after that. Now I am trying to learn how to use 2 new softwares and everytime I play a course or visit youtube, it gets really overwhelming and I can never really commit to fully therefore I am 10 months into the year and I haven't learnt how to use those softwares.

I don't know if this is just laziness or something else.

     I have depression and anxiety. to be more specific, I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. I have struggled with my mental illness for 5+ years. It is not something I exactly have control over and it’s not always situational. My life could be going perfect and I could still be depressed or anxious. I especially struggle as I developed my disorders at a young age, I wasn’t really able to experience much without the lens of my disorder. It is so hurtful hearing people refer to me as my mental illness. I was ashamed for a long time about it and told no one. Once people found out I was instantly labeled as the emo kid. the depressed kid. the loser that you want to avoid so you don’t catch it. Mental Illness isn’t contagious. I have a name aside from my diagnosis. Another thing I’ve learned from the general public is that I “don’t look depressed” or don’t come off that way. What exactly is your image of mentally ill? it comes in all different packages. Just because I don’t look the part doesn’t mean I don’t struggle with it. this is me refusing the stigma, refusing the labels people put on me, and trying to explain that my mental illness isn’t a choice. I didn’t wake up and decide depression was trendy and play the part. For anyone interested in learning more about mental illness, or you need help/suspect you may have mental illness, message me. there is nothing to be ashamed of.",10Oct2019,1

I haven't been able to wash my clothes in a week, and I can't go to classes because I don't want people to feel uncomfortable, and professors have the ability to expel students from class if they don't wear 'proper attire'. My anxiety levels are through the roof, and my depressive symptoms are running rampant and uncontrolled. I owe medical bills, credit card payments, and other things, but have 0 in my bank account and no source of income, and I can't work because of my anxiety symptoms. I can't even donate plasma because my heart-rate is too high. I've been feeling suicidal for a while, but I know that if nothing changes by the end of the month I can't keep myself back any longer. My therapist has said that if this continues she'll hospitalize me, so I've lied and said I was fine. I can't afford to be in the hospital, I'll fail my classes and my cat needs me. One of my professors is even punishing my absences, even though I have an accommodation through the school for lenience when it comes to missing class. She's the head of the entire math department and fails 40% of her students because 'I only want the best'. She's untouchable and doesn't give a shit. I'm just another failure to her. Many people at the school (it being a conservative religious school) do not care about mental health and prefer to see those who suffer as burdens to society.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the only one who cleans the apartment (5 roommates), and I'm the only one who buys any necessary items. In addition, there are three squatters (friends of one of my roommates) who I was initially tolerant of, but can no longer allow. They eat my food, use my razor and shaving gel, use my soap, shampoo, and towel, they leave the kitchen a wreck, and the entire living room (where they sleep) reeks of unwashed men. I'm being forced to provide not just for myself, but for eight additional people. I've spent the last year paying for freeloading roommates who don't give a damn, I can't do anything about those. But these squatters are criminal.

I have to take a class in order to catch up, because im really behind and I don't know how to do things (i am unsure what skills i posses to be hired, other than im pretty likable when im not panicking). 

I am very anxious. I have trouble communicating and Im very shy and scared.

197,"So I f*cked up. My childhood was f*cked up and I ended up marrying someone who “needed” me. She really did need someone. Her life was/is f*cked up.  It’s a mind f*ck.  I’m emotionally suffocated. 

She goes to therapy and pops pills appropriately. She is trying. She is doing her best which isn’t a normal best. It’s a con-man’s best because that is what she has been exposed to all her life. Used and thrown away. But she learns through therapy, through us, through her ongoing college education that there is another best she can apply. Progress is painfully slow. 

It’s been 9 years and I feel broken - mentally eroded. She gets triggered and is abusive. Such low self esteem. 

She says she is bisexual but it’s confusing to me. Most of her fantasies are about replicating the abuse onto young girls. I feel as though I am the excuse for her to say she is bisexual. The only thing, in her mind, she had to give of value was sex. When I didn’t want it that way, it hurt her. It took years to recalibrate her self worth. We still work on it. We don’t practice those unhealthy thoughts. It is hurtful. It’s ok. We are trying. 

I met her via craigslist looking for a house cleaning service. She cleaned twice and did a good job. One day she shows up drunk after walking 10 miles barefoot to runway from a sexual deviant couple who she was living with who were using her. She was broken. I chose to step in. The husband found her through her iPhone (their account) and came to my door. He was claiming her like you would claim a stray dog. Like a possession. Eventually, I chose to commit my life to her and us. Eventually. At that moment though, I just couldn’t live with myself letting her drift away back into a shit life. She wanted to be decent but didn’t know how. 

I maxed out my credit card sending her to the dentist. Sending her to get a physical. Ended up leaving her at the mental hospital for 6 days for intensive therapy. She was 38. Teeth broken. Body broken. Soul broken. 
I picked her up. I got the download from the nurse. She is mentally fragile. It’s ok. I knew it would be tough from the start. 

At first, she wasn’t pretty to me. Still isn’t. But it isn’t about that anymore. She is fighting for her life. Fighting to be a decent human. She used to and at times still is comfortable being exploited. Back then, at least that was predictable behavior. 

Now I feel alone. She is getting better. Still gets easily triggered. Still abusive. I just feel alone because it’s tough. I need therapy but it would be difficult maintaining my career with mental health record. I’m a pilot. 

Got her into college majoring in psychology. Best therapy. Getting results along with help from her psychologist and psychiatrist. I’ve helped her the most but she has fought me every step of the way. Ever tried to convince someone with mental health challenges that they are worth it. It’s lonely. She has had a rough life. Much like mine. 

She is an alcoholic. She was using alcohol to medicate herself. After what she has gone through, she needed something to give her mind some relief. We are better on that front. 

She is a 47 year old college junior. It’s been two classes at a time. She has a learning disability. 

I survived and faked it and she hated herself and lost. Life is life - it doesn’t care about anything. It’s indifferent. Abuse effects people differently. 

I realized that she may never progress to a point where she isn’t abusive. That’s how toxic her life has been. When you only know one language and that language is abuse, it’s the only way you have to communicate. She is learning though. She is old now. Nobody is interested in her body anymore. Not as much as before. 

There is much reward for helping. I wasn’t helped so it feels good helping her. She tells me thank you often. I tell her it’s ok. 

I’m just lonely I guess. It’s been 9 years and I’ve been on constant helper mode. It has eroded my mental health. I miss talking freely. I miss low stress. I miss healthy. 

I’m not sure if it will all be worth it. I’m 46. I support her 100%. She doesn’t have any life skills. She has been a possession all her life. She is learning adult skills. We are working on simple money stuff. She gets triggered and attacks. You have to be very careful about words. She is hypersensitive. I get tired. 

To her credit, she has it down to PTSD, learning disability, interpersonal relationships (poor), low self esteem, and anxiety attacks. The list was much longer. When she hurts she attacks and everything hurts her. 

I couldn’t walk away. No f*cking way. How do you close the door on need when you have a bag full of resources? How do you justify that to the mirror? She is that homeless lady walking the streets. Hooking for those who don’t mind the smell. She sold her body before. Often. It’s ok. She is here now. 

I cover it up. I try to preserve her chance at decency amongst judgmental folks. Folks that weren’t abused. Folks that don’t have to be someone else to get by. 

I’m not sure if our marriage is a love story. I had a terrible life and couldn’t relate with those around me. That’s what happens when you win after being abused. You don’t relate to those around you. I’d say our marriage is just me trying to feel good about saving someone. A need I got after being too small to stop my uncles and father rape my sisters. She is just trying to be decent, independent, and learning how to reciprocate the care she receives. 

I feel alone. I’m looking for validation or recognition or something. I don’t like to be cheered. Just maybe if there is someone out there that is doing the same as I am. Someone who can relate to me. That would be helpful. 

In the end. I chose to live my life this way. It’s ok. I am committed. I’m just lonely because I just want to be a good boy.",10Oct2019,4

Won’t someone take me home,

Am I flawed

My heart, my soul and finest jewels

Am I broken
Am I flawed,
Do I deserve a shred of worth, or am I just another
Fake fucked up lost cause?

203,"I want to be really careful with this post because I understand how the film definitely can be a trigger for people who are struggling with mental health.

It would be naive however to ignore the fact that the film definitely is capable of triggering a horrible twisted way in dealing with mental health and I seriously do not recommend it to people who are suffering with their mental health at the moment.

It is important however for the rest of society to open their eyes to how twisted the human mind can become when a person is neglected and outcasted. We all have a duty to look out for our friends and even our enemies. Everybody is capable of good. Your words and actions are very powerful and you have to be very careful how you speak to vulnerable people. Some people can think that the world is against them and the only way of dealing that is fighting against the world and the system.

Nobody should ever feel like that, you need to be kind to others. Show emotional intelligence and empathy and try to understand and help as much as you can. Just a few kind words. Never join in a bullying culture, people should never be mocked or laughed at.

I'm certainly not the perfect person and I think everyone can admit they've been horrible in the past or feel guilty for something you've said or done in reflection. But mental health is no joke any more, social media, especially, is too powerful and we all need to try and do more to care for everyone around us. Nobody deserves to suffer in silence, everyone needs a voice but fighting is never the answer.

You don't need to be a mental health expert to be kind. Whereas ill thought small words or actions could easily destroy a person KIND words and simply ACCEPTING someone for what you may consider weird or unusual likewise could have a massive difference in turning someone's life around for the good.

Everyone wants to be loved and accepted, help them feel it.

It is mental health awareness week, the movie is certainly eye opening and powerful. If anyone has seen the movie and you are suffering please reach out to support. There is always a way out even if you don't think you can see one.

I really hope this post is helpful and it would be interesting if anyone else who's seen the movie understands my perspective, Or has anything else to add!

I don't care what comes after. I don't care that I'm 26 years old with no aspirations and no family or friends. I disowned my family. I deserve to be alone and I deserve to die alone. I just can't get over the fact that it's taking so long. Suicide is no longer something I wish to do. I've tried a handful of times and the worst I got out of it was being in a coma. Now I'm alive but as much as that may be true, I still always ponder on why I had to come back to this life. The questions are many, the answers are few. Idk, I just felt a need to vent and finally get it out there. I don't like myself, my irregular qualities and worst of all, I hate my mind. If I can't kill myself, then I will let nature take its course. Only thing I can do, is try and speed it up. I'm sure the cigarettes I've been smoking for almost 10 years, will soon start taking some long term effects. Not to mention my fatty liver from too much alcohol consumption when I was younger.

Hello,

25 years of mental health stuff, addiction, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, OCD, trauma, ADHD .....all in all I've got a difficult head to be in, reeeeealllly mean and really persistent inner critic....

Tons of therapy, reaching out to support network, recovery meetings, treatment centers, taking time, attempting to change behaviors and integrate healthier habits (diet, exericse, sleep, meditation, changing social circle, tried many meds, journaling, energy work, ayahuasaca, paying down debt, searching for meaningful work and experiences, travel, bibliotherapy, self care, working with others, productivity app where I make sure to meditate/take cold showers/practice spanish/practice sign language/do affirmations/call parents/consider financial habits/do resentment prayers/take inventory of self, hit the gym, and more)

but it never feels like enough. I still seem to be getting a constant beat down from the fearful/mean spirited inner critic. I feel disconnected from myself and from reality most of the time and so all of my efforts seem so frutiless. Progress seems glacial and given the intensity of the storms in my head I often go to a pretty cynical, angry, dark place because I'm frustrated with how useless and hopeless I feel.

People tell me to be nicer to myself and I think I'm getting glimpses of what that means, but it's soooooooooooooooo freaking hard. The fearful, critical mind is active 24/7...it's berating me and filling my head with fears and reasons I'm a failure on a millisecond to millisecond basis. I can't interact with any part of life without seeing a hundred ways in which I am a failure. It's absurd.

Some of the 12 step work I've done actually feels great after words (specifically step 12, working with others). Even though I'm often hesistant and bored in the moment and don't want to be there I often (not always) feel better after.

I try to catalogue my ""problems"" or experiences or things that hurt, and I think I make a lot of progress, but it's just never enough. I still feel so beholden to fear and mood swings and anxiety. It's exhausting.

Maybe it's pointless to throw this in to the void. Maybe I'm just asking the internet to give me enlightenment so I can cope with this misery, and purpose to I can finally cure this feeling of being perpetually lost.

It if there was, it certainly wasn't autism. All the traits of autism spectrum disorder that I identified with when I was 14 I no longer believe I have. And while I was fine to just forget about it, it's begun to affect my career path having that diagnosis on my record.
