0,"I know that I need to see a mental health professional, but I've been exceedingly reluctant because of my last few experiences with them. The first mental health professional I'd ever seen was a college mental health counselor at my university a little under a year ago, because I'd suddenly kind of crashed after the first month of my freshman year and trying to put an extremely stressful summer behind me. I didn't know what to expect, wasn't really expecting anything positive to amount from it, and I was annoyed that the first appointment was pushed back about a month because of various things. She seemed overly patronizing when I did see her, caustic towards my family when asking for my family history. I went to group therapy a few times and quit because I didn't really want to talk to anyone else about my mental health, and because dealing with other people's problems seemed ridiculously stressful.

The first psychiatrist I saw prescribed me Seroquel the first time I saw him, because I cited my main complaint as sleep problems (I was staying awake for a couple days at a time and then sleeping every 2-3 days or so, generally exhausted the entire time, just not able to sleep). This struck me as something to be wary about. I didn't take it for more than a week, because I was sleeping for about 20 hours every day with no energy to do anything, and I was having excessive levels of anxiety and acting super paranoid the entire time. 

I stopped going to classes (it started with math because one kid was very clearly romantically interested in me, and I couldn't really handle being around him), stuck to being nocturnal, only ate once a day at around 4 AM when I'd walk to some fast food place or another where I wouldn't have to interact with anyone. I spent a lot of time really derealized, so I mostly stuck to watching movies, writing, and eventually got a MMJ card when I turned 18 so that the derealization felt a little more reasonable. I'm also trans, so a lot of it was also extreme dysphoria and mild self harm along with some suicidal ideation thrown in there for good measure. It wasn't pleasant, but I dropped out of my freshman year and moved back to my hometown, where I thought things might get better in a better environment.

I'm living in an apartment on my own now, I was accepted to my hometown's university, and I've been talking to my two closest friends and spending time with them almost every day. My sleep schedule is pretty much back to normal now, but I've been having other problems. I feel like I can't focus at all, sometimes I just forget words and it's really hard to talk sometimes. I've been ridiculously impulsive with money, haven't had the motivation to really do anything, including eating. I freaked out and jumped out of the shower the other day because I swore I could see a giant beetle crawling across my shower wall, but when I checked again it was just the shower curtain liner magnet. I spent about ten minutes trying to figure out what to do when I thought I saw a dying cat outside, breathing heavily, before I realized it was actually a plastic bag. I keep hoping everything will just go away, and having people around me to keep me accountable for going to classes will force me to actually do well in college.

I also don't want to get help because I will have to tell my mom, and I've been trying to mostly maintain the impression that I'm just going through somewhat severe depression, because she's super anxious and I don't want to freak her out about medical bills or blame herself for my mental health or anything like that. I think talking to my friends about it has freaked them out a little bit, and it's been a trial trying to relate to some of my friends who have really only dealt with depression and anxiety before. I also don't really want to talk to anyone. My grandmother keeps texting me, and I don't have the motivation to respond even though I feel guilty, people I knew in my freshman year keep texting me and I feel bad for being completely disinterested. The only people I really want to talk to are my two close friends because they give me something to do instead of sitting alone, bored out of my mind. They kind of keep me accountable for eating and getting up and interacting at all, and at least pretending that I'm a normal human being. I think I only really want to go to college because my mom knows me as a high-achieving, pretty intelligent person who has claimed to want to have a successful career and a future. I feel like everything I do is just because other people expect me to do it, or need me to do it, and the more I think about that, the more I want to withdraw and just sit alone in my room until I just kind of don't exist.

I think the only thing I really want is a cat, and I don't think that's going to happen. My mom says she considered getting me one and decided against it, and I guess that's fine. If she changes her mind, I've done way too much research on how to take care of a cat, but honestly, I'd probably have even less of a reason to leave home if I did have a cat.

I keep hoping that maybe the longer I pretend I'm functional, the more that actually becomes true, even though I know that's not how it works, and a lot of this is manifesting because I spend all of my middle and high school years bottling things up and it was really unhealthy how hard I crashed when I finally felt like I didn't have to keep it contained for anyone around me.

I'm sorry if this is disorganized or kind of pointless, I don't really have the focus to go back and fix it at the moment, so I guess this is going to be left as is, egregiously flat and rambling etc.",28Jun2018,1
1,"Let me start out by saying I've had a pretty messed up childhood. I've had crippling anxiety since I was around 8. My grandmother, luckily raised me and took over as my parents were unfit. My parents are the ones who gave me anxiety and other mental issues. Its been tough. I always ran to my Nana’s when things got bad. She was the most caring, kind hearted woman I have ever met. Not a mean bone in her body, treated everyone equally and truly never judged anyone. We never fought, not once. She was my safe place. She was much like my mom, but so much more. I honestly have trouble making friends because of the high standards she's set for people I want in my life. 

Two weeks ago I got a call that she passed away. It was extremely unexpected. I was completely shocked. I have been living in the south and hadn't seen her in 6 months. Its the longest I've ever been away from home. She was only 62. 

I know most of what I'm feeling is normal, but I've always struggled with depersonalization and serialization as a child, and since I have been on my own I've been alright. I feel it happening again. I'm having constant thoughts about the meaning of life and my own death. I think it just really brought me back to reality that one day I'm going to be nothing. Everything feels weird, like I'm in a fog. I don't care to have a relationship with anyone because I feel like nothing matters anymore. I know she wouldn't want me to feel this way, but I haven't accepted her death yet. One day I’m speaking to her on the phone, the next week she is ashes. I'm still so much in shock, even worse than the days after it happened. I'm afraid of becoming suicidal because I can't escape my own thoughts. 

I don’t know what I expect out of this. Thanks for reading.

TLDR; The most important person in my life died and I can't cope. ",28Jun2018,2
2,"Hey guys 
So I posted this kind of thing before last week and I would really like some more help on how to deal with jt...long story short, I had this feel intrusive thought beginning in February which didn't leave till like last week.. I thought tnah it would go away and it never did, so I kept exposing myself to that thought on the internet and stuff in hopes it would make me less obsessive about this. Unfortunately from February to Now, I've also been studying for my mcat as well, and the intrusive thoughts didn't help of course. I took my mcat in June and I get the score back next week, but I know I bombed it really bad. I got anxious during the exam and cried, which thankfully had nothing to do with the intrusive thought, but rather my test anxiety. However these days I have been feeing extremely guilty. I should have known better than to expose myself to things that would trigger my intrusive thoughts and yet I did anyways. I am too scared to tell my (Indian immigrant) parents because they will get so mad at me, but I also I need to get it off my chest, hence talking to u guys :). The anxiety over the guilt, and the exam in general is exacerbating my depression and anxiety and I've been feeling really suicidal in the past few days. I have another exam July 24th and yet I can't study as well as I can because I am so stressed out, guilty and worried over getting my score back. Any idea how I can combat this and just become myself again? I literally don't recognize myself anymore...",28Jun2018,1
3,"As long as I can remember, i've always been this way. I come from a very introvert family that doesn't talk much even within our own. Im almost 31 and im trying to figure out if how I am is at all explainable or normal. Its easier if i just list them.   


\-I hate answering, or making phone calls, even best friends, wife, work, I would prefer not too. I get an overwhelming feeling of doom and repulsion. 

\-I hate knocking on doors, ive stood at doors for over 20 minutes trying to fight the urge to leave, again, doom, repulsion, like im being told not too knock. Even doors inside my own house or others, if its closed, I just dont want to open them.   


\-Looking someone in the eyes to long is like falling off a cliff, mostly why I never have gone to see a professional. Eye contact, doors, just too many barriers.   


\- I often have internal conversations, they usually run on the dark side, ie: people hate me, people are watching me, judging, sometimes I feel like Im being followed, but i never know who.   


\-My house, is also my prison, but I'd rather be in there than even the front yard.   


Those are just the big ones, I dont think i really hear anyone talk to me, but sometimes its like I feel like my brain is overriding me, or insisting stuff. I joke that im like a vampire with the whole needing to be asked in to come into a house and being reclusive. I am a man of very few words, but Im always talking in my head, never stops. I have an extremely hard time trying to sleep. I dont know family history, as my family literally only speaks in small talk.   


I feel like im pretty normal with my wife and kids, and I can do a lot of stuff like normal, but sometimes, i just cant get myself to leave the house. I go through waves of being happy to thinking even my own wife is plotting against me. I never get violent, i mostly just shut out and shut down until the the wave has passed. At work sometimes ill feel like everyone up to the CEO is plotting something. I dont know what it is, and it maybe that im just a weird guy. ",28Jun2018,5
4,"Theres so many things on this website that I can relate to very well an a lot of stuff I didnt know had words for or was a thing that other people felt besides me... and l've used the suicide watch reddit ( Im really not fimiler with terms and stuff on here to describe things sorry) an this has been the first time ive ever really done stuff like this and recived responces so this is all really new. I have a therapist that i see who i like alot but in general its hard to talk with people or explian things so now im terrifed that ive messed up because today i saw him and talked and stuff an i didnt mention that a few days before i reeeaaally felt like commiting suicide. How do i mention i almost did something like that but decided not to because of some random stuff i read on the internet? I don't understand myself at all most of of the time and dont know why I feel things or how I feel them so Its all very confuseing and I don't understand how to start regular conversations and am already terrified that the regular things Im fimiler with doing like wanting to hurt myself an then somehow talking myself out of it or some other reason will make mental health people im working with want to fire me / be mad and upset because Im not doing good enough and dont deserve there help or time anymore. But i feel like ive lied and i really really didnt mean to! I really really don't know what the right thing would be to do?  Is not telling him this lieing ? What the right thing to do?

P.S  I emaild him after my appointment about questions I have on how / what I should talk about with meeting the supervisor of the caseworker im seeing... because ive been wanting to switch and since my caseworker is not going to be in the office for a bit her supervisor (Who is also a caseworker) agreed to meet me during the time I uselly see mine  an he hasn't responded and by now hes done with work and . im just anxious and upset and dont wan to do the wrong things that i always seem to do and as it gets later in the day things get worse for me in general so im kinda struggling right now and would appriceiat oppinons on the matter thanks!

5,"Puberty. Too many thoughts. Not the kind of person to talk to people, unless drunk which I regret the next day. Or random people on the internet who I can open up to without affecting my everyday life by it. 

Why do I feel like I have some sort of ""character"" that I need to act by and feel like I cannot act differently than I have been acting since that would cause too much attention on me.


Also, read another post and I imagine talking to a therapist a lot in my head but don't think I actually have enough of a reason to go see one. Also would put too much attention on me if I were to see one and tell my family.

8,"As many of you know, recovering from a concussion can be incredibly challenging, not just physically, but mentally and emotionally as well. My name is Ian, and after suffering my fourth concussion a year ago, I could not continue my pursuit of a stressful career in finance. Many dark hours in my room were spent questioning my every decision and battling crippling anxiety and depression. This last year, although my most challenging yet, has led to more self growth than any other year. I had friends show me the beauty of support and love, and people surprise me and break my heart. Through it all, I realized that my passion is making music.


One of the most productive ways of dealing with anxiety is by expressing yourself honestly. When I sing, I feel that I am releasing much of the pain that I have felt in the past. I do not know what the rest of my life will bring, but I am more hopeful now making music than pursuing investment banking.


I am writing here because I hope to share my story going forward with others who are dealing with what I have dealt with. I do not know if I will ever not be depressed, but I am staying positive and working hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle... and singing my heart out.

9,(Trigger Warning maybe and long post) OK so I'm a minor and my depression has been really bad latey ( lately as in the past 2 years) and I'm getting back into cutting and having suicidal thoughts at least every week. I want help but the only problem is that I would need to tell my parents and I don't want them to be scared  or give me a 4 hour lecture about how its not worth it. I know that just means they love me but... My dad would be mad as hell and I don't want my mother to be worried. I'm afraid that if I'll tell them it would lead into them breaking up for what ever reason. I'm also worryed that its all in my head in a way that I'm looking for attention but I dont know and I think I'm scared to know... Sorry for wasting your time. Have a better day tomorrow,28Jun2018,5

11,"I hate myself and being around people for a lot of reasons but one of the most prominent recently is also one of the most embarrassing.  
  
I like to create artificial or small cuts/scabs on my body, mostly my hands and face. Sometimes I accidentally cut myself or sometimes I literally pick at my skin with a piece of metal (yes I know I'll probably get a horrible disease and die). After I've created a wound I obsessively pick at it and it never heals.  
  
I rarely notice it consciously and when I do it's hard to stop. Most recently I got a small cut from shaving and it has now grown to 3 huge scabs on my chin. IDK what is wrong with me but I fucking hate being out like this, it makes me even uglier and IDK how to stop.

12,"I’ve never asked a question on here, but I’m struggling a lot. I know I have anxiety but I find it to be worse in certain situations, particularly with friends, which messes up friendships, and then creates more anxiety in future friendships. Terrible cycle. 

Basically, I get above normal anxiety when I try to communicate with a friend (send a text or message in an app) I can see they’ve seen it and they don’t respond. My anxiety becomes so intense that I repeatedly, almost compulsively, try to check and see if they’ve responded (when I know they haven’t because there’s not an alert) and then I get anxious and sad when they haven’t. I was wondering if anyone has any tips on things I can do to try and be less anxious in these situations? I know that 90% of the time they just forgot to respond or meant to and forgot to press send or just didn’t have an answer at that time, but my mind always assumes they hate me or I’ve done something to make them upset, and this causes a terrible spiral.

13,"Hey all, so I just wanted some advice. As a kid I was always a very ""active"" sleeper. My parents said I would have night terrors, walk, and talk. My cousin did it as well. I've also always had very vivid dreams. One in particular is waking up feeling like there is a man in my room and needed to turn on the lights to check, and more than once I've slept talked to my fiance about the man in the room. I don't remember the associated dream always. I am 24 and recently experienced the loss of my uncle which kicked up my GAD and MDD. I also recently stopped taking Wellbutrin (with MD assistance) due to increasingly severe anxiety attacks.

16,"Honestly kinda at the end of my rope here. Myself and my wife are both in the military, and are not currently together. I’ll probably get my orders in a couple months or so, but with that being said things aren’t as good as they could be. Recently my wife has started at a new office and has been feeling really overwhelmed. Her attitude has completely changed and we’ve had a few spats from things we’ve said while frustrated.

Earlier this week she’s having another rough day, and flat out tells me I need to leave. It’s pretty out of the blue and she just keeps telling me that’s what I need to do. After a very long phone call she breaks and tells me that before enlisting she was diagnosed with acute bipolar disorder (I always knew something was up but until recently she did a good job hiding it). Given our current jobs in the military they screen pretty heavily for things like that. However they can’t physically look into your medical records and never found out she had been taking mood stabilizers. She refuses going in and even talk to someone let alone ask to be evaluated. Stating that she’s not ready. 

So my question is.. what do I do? She’s miserable and pushing myself and her friends away. They’ve left but obviously I’m not going anywhere when she’s not right like this. She’s never mentioned hurting herself or anything like that, but just says she’s given up for right now. So I honestly don’t know what to do. I don’t want to report my own wife, but I keep getting told there’s nothing to do right now..

because i deserve it.

kill myself. nobody would notice anyways.

19,"I'm thinking of engaging a neuropsychologist assessment for possible  ADHD, Aspergers and/or OCD in Melbourne, Australia. The cost is around the mid  $1000s mark and I've read all about the advantages of a neuropsych  assessment. My only concern is whether they can accurately diagnose/rule out any mental illness that I have and produce a report that's universally recognized by all mental health practitioners.

The reason I'm interested in seeing a  neuropsychologist is because of two issues; I have previously seen over a  dozen clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, but none of them are  willing to formally diagnose what I have. All they asked were a few  questions in less than 30 minutes and then verbally told me that I have  OCD and anxiety. No physical reports were ever issued.

Having  said that, I did go to a psychologist who spent around 4 hours over 3  days then diagnosed me with Aspergers. However, after all that time and  money spent on the latter, no psychiatrists agree with the diagnosis.  This is why I'm considering a neuropsychologist, as they have the time,  skills and resources to properly assess and diagnose exactly what I'm  suffering from.

The second issue is I  really want to find out exactly what I have...either there might be more  than those 3 conditions or to rule any of them out. By the way, I only  suspect I have ADHD based on reading the symptoms online and doing a  mini self questionnaire/assessment.

  
**TL;DR:** I want to find out  exactly what mental health conditions I have with a formal written  report that is universally accepted by all mental health practitioners.  Should I see a clinical or neuropsychologist? I'm in Melbourne, Australia.

22,"Every aspect of my life is officially on fire beyond my control as of last year. Everything from childhood, to family, to relationships, to hobbies, to career. One after another, starting with an alcoholic parent, and ending with the first major career job imploding with the company. There's a ton of other things going on right now, from multiple ongoing lawsuits I'm indirectly affected by, to trying to quit drinking and smoking this year, to trying to get my shit together as a functional adult when I'm already in my late 20's.

I am not a healthy functional person. I do not have good stress coping mechanisms, and am still not a well-functioning at being an adult. Then when my parent had a stroke a few years back,  who had been expected to drop dead for nearly a decade, with all of us around for the seizure certain this was the end ... I kind of finally broke. (They're still alive, and intentionally doubled down on everything the doctor said to cut.) It was a year of drinking before I finally pulled it back together.

The important job I went to college for. I did it for the year after college. I was fine. Then there was several consecutive months of stress on par with the last time I ""broke"" due to bullshit and drama going on at the time. The company imploded. I got a few months at a chill job which I was beyond happy to work at for the lower stress ... then found an opening doing what I'd been doing before.

The stress came back. Like it never left. Like it's attached to the work, despite the work being as easy as it was last year. I'm now so scatterbrained and unreliable, they would replace me if they could.

I'm currently trying to work two jobs and because American healthcare is fucked, me trying to juggle hours between them has lost me insurance that covers more than the local clinic visit. Not that my deductible wasn't already unaffordable. I'm terrified of burning my savings further for someone that will just tell me things I already know (Already done this), or tell me the OTC supplements I found are better than what they could prescribe (Already done this).

I have no fucking idea what to do now. Every fiber of my being wants to do what I did before: curl up in a ball, disappear and drink. Every day, I fuck up more at my job, which only cycles back into the stress. I can barely output half the workload I should be.

23,"So let me start with my backstory as far back as I can remember. I've always had a weird feeling about life and my place in it. I rarely enjoyed affection from my parents and never wanted birthday parties thrown for myself even as a kid (I also didn't like pictures taken of myself). I've always had horrible nightmares as a child, and for some reason I seem to remember one where the dream was like a projection on the wall of my room while I was awake (would that be a hallucination? Or was I actually sleeping?) Besides from this, I've never made many friends and had very disobedient behavior at school (I was baaaddddd, third grade teacher told my mother I was the worst she ever had in 30 years). This behavior continued through middle school, I ended up in alternative education. Once Highschool started, I was back with general populace, and the time I spent away from these same peers / same class in middle school made me feel like an outcast terribly (although students seemed to somehwhat like me, I always perceived it as fake). It wasn't long until I started on drugs like marijuana and alchohol. I was very addicted to marijuana during highschool. I also remember having a very hard time looking people in the eyes during highschool, and walking down the hall past people was a literal nightmare for me. So much so I remember the right side of my face going numb and feeling like I was going to pass out one time. Highschool I want as bad behavior wise, but I tried to sleep through it all. Might I add my mother is the type that likes to pretend that everything is ok and never asked me about anything so I never told her. Not sure if she was fed up or liked to pretend I wasn't who I was. I did end up graduating high school, and afterwards things seemed to flip for me socially. I started working construction right away, and was meeting women and having sex at this point. I also really started to do hard drugs at this point which I've recently heard is like self medicating for some, idk. Drugs were my life for the next 10 years or so (got married in this time, was horrible to my wife, she started using, divorce, yadyadayada). So now I'm on suboxone only, but I've recently been having extremely strange thoughts and beliefs. Like that everyone is plotting against me, sometimes in coordination even though i don't know how they would know each other. I am inspector at work and I've been obsessed with checking over things a lot and the work has to be perfect or it will bother me for weeks. I feel like my coworkers are the masterminds of my saboteurs, knowing that I freak over the minute and doing purposefully yo mess with me. This has started to lead to the very strange thought that I am actually living in a dream, and that's how people know all this stuff about me, is because they are projections of my conscience. I then I have moments I don't think this the case. I've been obsessed with politics and news and watching ASMR. If I leave the ASMR on right before I'm falling asleep I have waking dreams that their voice is changing and weird images, but I haven't fell asleep yet. I know I need to see someone about this, I'm just afraid to lose my job and afraid to know in general. I guess I'm asking for help, or at least some re assurance of reality, or someone to talk to.",28Jun2018,3
24,"Throwaway so no one knows who I am.

I just figured out the truth about life. Everything is completely meaningless. I will just forget everyone I’ve loved in my next life when I am someone else. I will forget who I am currently, and have forgotten who I once was. This will keep repeating until the end of time. I don’t want to die. Everything is so worthless and has no meaning. I tried to talk to my mom about this but she doesn’t understand. She says that she’ll always love me and that she’ll always remember me. I tried talking to my boyfriend and he says that life is whatever you make it. No one but me can understand. I don’t know what to do if only I am meant to understand this. I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t know how to explain this. I can’t sleep, it’s 2AM. I’ve been crying and trying to make my mom understand.

I give gifts. I write letters. I help out. I ask how people are doing. Why doesn't anybody reciprocate?

I best I can manage is making tentative plans with people that inevitably fall through because they don't care about me.

Together with my trust issues and being too shy to socialize since I was little, it seems like everything's getting harder everyday.

It doesn't seem like myself anymore because I was once a positive girl, not like super positive but like if there was something I really I'd go and make it.

I hate humans, like I don't easily trust someone and I can smell their 'liar nature' the first time I ever talk to.

My angers have been out of control lately as well. I was known for being really calm but lately I'm just pissed off everyday.

With the antidepressants: At work I was having DPDR episodes, periodically locking up, staring into space, withdrawing into myself, spacing out, etc all while ""you look like your cat got run over"", becoming infamous for never smiling/laughing/etc, and experiencing reduced executive functions, impaired memory, and being severely scatterbrained.

30,"I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a couple years ago, I feel like I’m close to full recovery, but there are certain things more complicated to solve than others. I haven’t been on medication or therapy for a while, I can’t afford it at all so the only thing I would need is some mental guidance and opinions on how to deal with certain thought patterns by myself (or I probably just need to vent). 

I’ve been neglected pretty much my whole life, my dad was never present, my mom almost died and a couple years later I saw her being abused by her ex boyfriend. I never really had that many friends at school until grade 9, and I don’t remember - ever - having a good sleep routine. Plus, I was sexually and emotionally abused several times during my teenage years. 

Im currently 21 and a lot changed. I feel like I can manage relationships easier, I can stand up for myself in a calm and respectful way (without storming out or playing games with my partner) and I’m no longer dealing with any kind of addiction. Overall, I feel healthier and happier. 

After a few months of being almost anxiety-free (which felt like heaven), I’ve been noticing that I’m in a constant state of anxiety at some point everyday. I feel like crying “out of nowhere”, and I’m more sensitive to what my partner and other people say and do when around me. 

I moved to a different country, so I don’t have any friends or family of my own around. I hang out with my partner’s friends often when with him but I’ve had proof of some of them not wanting my boyfriend to date me, I’ve had proof of some of them not wanting to hang out with me, I sat on several occasions with some of them just to be ignored the whole time, like I wasn’t worth their time, like I wasn’t good enough for them, like I had nothing interesting and funny to say. 

I enjoy being outside, I’m very friendly and talkative, I’ve been trying to remember myself of that, but I end up getting in a huge argument with my own mind. I know I’m so much more but by surrounding myself of all these successful, mentally organized people at first it motivated me, but now it’s destroying me. I feel like a failure, I don’t have a career or a job whatsoever, I don’t seem to get any of my projects going (not speaking the language 100% and having no contacts at all doesn’t help) when back home I’d be pretty successful at anything I tried to do if I put my head into it. 

And THEN I look at my boyfriend and I wonder why would he waste his time and money with me, why me? Why wouldn’t he go for someone similar to the girls he was with before? (All skinny, lucky, probably no baggage and residents of the country he’s from, speaking the same language as him). And even though I know I’m worth of love, I still feel lonely and rejected, by the only people I have the opportunity to hang out with. 

When I was home I did a lot of mistakes, mostly because I was sick and doing drugs all the time, but even then people knew what I was capable of doing and my friends respected me and never left me. Some of them were the reason I overcame a few of my problems. They knew where I came from, they knew what my interests were and what I had done or been into in the past or present. These people don’t, and they don’t care either. ",28Jun2018,1
31,"I'm a 16 year old girl, I've been through messed up things in my past (severe emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse). I have bad ways of coping like using drugs and alcohol. I know it's not healthy, and I am actively working on getting better and I'm making progress that I'm proud of. I do have another coping mechanism that is very... weird? but it truly helps me stay in a better place and makes me feel way less alone. 

I have imaginary friends, and they're based off of fictional characters. My friends and I are very into Marvel movies, and my imaginary friends are based off of Logan (the Wolverine) and the younger version of Charles Xavier. I like to think of Logan as a protector. He gives me strength and encouragement and doesn't let me do things that will hurt me and helps me stand up for myself. And Charles does the same but he's like.. in my head always? cos he's a telepath. When bad memories of my past come up I like to think that he's reading my mind and giving me more positive thoughts. When I'm alone and I have no real friends around I have them here to entertain me and I can just vent to them and basically imagine what they would say back to me if they were real.

I am completely aware that these are fictional characters, I don't think they're real at all. I do talk to them, though, but only out loud when I'm alone. Imagining that they're there makes me happy and makes me feel like I'm being protected from the toxic people and things in my life. 

I am really scared to tell any of my friends or family about this because I'm afraid they will think I'm insane. I'm also starting therapy again soon and I'm scared that I'll say something about my imaginary friends and be judged and I'm scared that I will be forced to forget about my friends (if it's unhealthy however, I will try to understand that and let go of this habit).

Am I okay? Is this healthy, or should I stop thinking this way? When I start therapy, is this something that I should open up about, or should I keep it to myself? I'm honestly just really relieved to get this off my chest...",28Jun2018,2
32,"So I have been diagnosed with GAD (generalised anxiety disorder). I'm also struggling with (what I see as) bad self-esteem issues. I always prioritize other people ahead of myself, I'll also let myself into bad situations because I want others to have it better, and now I've began to accept that. I'm also rarely angry towards others, because I can find some explanation for why they deserved it and not me.

Are there any for me to help myself? Maybe a book I could read (but not like those kind of books that tell you you're a warrior, I'd like a book with a funny take on the issue). Or some activities I could try.

33,"I’m 20 years old, I live at home. I was abused emotionally by my mother most of my life so as of recently maybe the past month I’ve been living with my dad full time (they’re divorced) because I thought I needed space to heal.

Now something so weird has been happening to me the past couple years or so. My relationships with both parents have been up and down. Due to my depression I sometimes push them away. Whenever I push them away this is when the weird thing happens. If our relationship is strained, cut off and disconnected I get a weird sensation sometimes when I think of them....in my genitals :-( The stronger the aversion to the parent the more often this sensation occurs.

I can’t control it but when it happens I quickly divert my attention. But it’s been happening so often lately with my mom because I’ve wanted nothing to do with her (I know the quick fix to this weird ass problem would just be to let her in my life again and love her in normal and healthy ways because that always does the trick but ugh I still don’t want to) and it’s annoying, frustrating and makes me feel confused and disgusted in myself. 

I don’t understand why this happens, why I get that burst of energy in that area idk. I don’t feel any other sexual feelings or desires, just a physical sensation in my private parts sometimes when I think of her. I’m not sure if it’s all those years of abuse that have caused this to become an issue for me (I was never sexually abused, only emotionally and verbally). Idk how to deal with it other than letting her in my life again. But I wish there was something I could do to make it stop without having to do that. 

Has anyone been through something similar or heard of this phenomena before? I’m feeling so ashamed even though it’s out of my control. I just want it to stop, it makes me feel so uncomfortable in my own body. ",28Jun2018,3
35,"So I had a talk with my Dad recently after some family issues went down, and he explained to me that all his life he has felt that something in his brain has been constantly holding him back. He grew up in the 60's in South Africa, and described that he has always had difficulty visualising images, and that sometimes words are lost to him in conversation and he either has to wait a while for the words to come to him, or he has to explain his way around that particular word.

He also attended speech therapy as a kid for help pronouncing certain letters (not long words though) and he tells me that while he was alright with writing, and still writes poems today, he has always had trouble reading. Specifically when he turns the page he has a lot of trouble remembering what character was doing what and the events that occured. It doesn't seem like he has trouble reading the words themselves, though he may just have not told me that. There could also be other effects that he hasnt told me or isnt aware of.

He was bullied at times during his time at school, even by his friends. He also describes that his parents didn't give him much in the way of attention and love, focussing more on their own carrers and hobbies. He also told me that he had meningitis as a young kid, and wondered whether that had a long term effect on his cognition. All of these could explain parts of what has happened to his cognition. 

He has seen many doctors about this but none have been able to pinpoint exactly what was wrong with him, though that was during growing up so the field of psychology wasn't were it is today. I have suggested he see a doctor again and perhaps look into CBT or something similar, but if anyone has any suggestions for ways to treat or identify what this issue is we would be very grateful. Not asking for a diagnosis, just suggestions as to what it could be/what psychotherapy options would help.

36," back at the university , I was a social introvert that didn't care about much , never had problem making friends, some of them thought I was weird , some of them thought I was a great friend. Anyhow , in my second year I started talking to this girl in class, she was this sweet beautiful girl, passionate and had something about her, never in my life I have been in love with someone, this was the exception.

So like any dumb introvert I tried to become her friend to get close to her. she ended up friendzoning me . She told me she wanted me as a friend bla bla bla , you know how it goes. and like any dumb introvert I had trouble coping with this , but tried to stay her friend because I still wanted to see her everyday, her smile was like a drug for me . most peculiar is I didn't feel anything like sexual attraction towards this girl, I was in love with her mind.

But she didn't think much of me other than a great ""friend"", So after another pitiful attempt to tell her I love her and that would be perfect together , obviously that didn't work, we lost contact when she travalled to a foreign country to get a job.

This experience left me with a particular very embarassing behavior , sometimes I would be alone in the room and I would say her name a little bit loud without even thinking. sometimes when I remember something embarassing that happened to me , I would say her name again. I don't know why It **just goes out of my mouth.**

It started happening when she first rejected me 6 years from now. and this still happens to me 7 years after meeting her. I do see her on social media sometimes, she's as beautiful as ever , I can't stop thinking about her , I've had several relationships after and I couldn't feel what I felt with this particular girl.

I don't know what to do , sometimes I feel like I was better of never meeting her. She left a hole in me and I don't know how to fix it.",28Jun2018,1

38,"Hi All,

Long story short, I’ve always been a relatively resilient person. People would feel confident confiding in me and asking me for help. I would provide people emotional support and was able to graduate college and hold down jobs to support my partners at the time.

Since developing an anxiety disorder, I now work from home and stepping out of my front door is a challenge. This state I ‘suddenly’ fell into is really really playing with my mind. How can I be a good husband or father to my children of the impending breakdown I had could happen again in the future?

It’s like I could maybe reach a high position with good pay but who’s to say that anxiety won’t kick in again in the future and incapacitate me again?

Really need your help. I want to get better and be a functioning and happy member of society with healthy attitudes.

40,"In mid 2014 I was gifted a beautiful female kelpie x border collie from a woman who wanted to travel. She was already an old*er* dog, about 6 or 7, when I received her and was also fully trained. Being a rescue dog, she also had an incredibly beautiful, timid and loving nature. She was with me for what feels like a lifetime, and was there for me through a lot of my struggles and low points. Anywhere I went that she could go, she came with me. I very rarely left her if I didn’t have to. Even during my time as a fabricator in a 4WD workshop, she quite often came to work with me and always stayed nearby. I think she even loved being there as much as I did.
From the day I got her, she was always such a youthful dog for her age - even in the months, weeks and days leading up to her death. She loved walks, she loved exploring, she loved people and she loved going for drives. The car was probably her favourite place to be.

As someone that’s always been marred by mental issues I never realised how profound the impact she had on me, and how much I actually appreciated her until she was gone.

I’ve never felt as scared and desperate as I did in the moments that she was letting go, and had never felt hope like I had in the moments that we thought she was improving.

It was only after she passed that I realised the effect she had on me, as it’s been in these last five months since then that the proverbial cracks have really begun to show.

Since she passed I’ve been constantly bound by a chain of hopelessness, emptiness and a general sense of sadness. I’ve become increasingly cynical, bitter and confused. I now know less of who am, and get much less enjoyment out of day to day life.

Worst of all, I’m finding it increasingly difficult just coping with life in general. I just feel like I’m failing. I don’t want to exist here anymore - I don’t want to die, I just want to leave. I want to be completely alone.

42,"Hiya reddit. This is the little humble story of me trying to stay alive. 

Yesterday, I gathered up my courage (and asked a friend to join me to keep me from ditching) and went to a psychiatrist.

I last went to the psych 7 years ago, when I first got diagnosed with anxiety, PTSD and depression. But I didn't follow the treatment and after the diagnosis was made, I ran away. I was scared of drugs, I was only 15 and didn't want to accept that even a younger person can have PTSD. I was stubborn but I knew I was in extremely bad shape.
Fast forward 3-4 years, with the help of my amazing bf, I started to get better. My PTSD disappeared nearly completely and my anxiety, although being unmanagable sometimes, didn't stop me from going to school or making friends. I was much more confident and energetic than before. And this was without using any medicine.
But after I got into university and had to get out of my comfort zone, I realized that all the anxiety, all these thoughts about death, feeling of abandonement, paranoia started flooding back. I couldn't handle it. After the first semester my grades suffered incredibly and my relationship too. My emotions and my thoughts were out of my hand, like a typhoon in a raging ocean, they crashed on me causing panic attacks and intrusive or paranoid thoughts 24/7. I was on the edge of my seat, ready to fall apart for nothing all the time. And as these tiring storms died down, they drained me of every little feeling I had in me. When my panic attacks were done, I was left with scaringly strong derealization to the point that I had to pinch my own limbs to make sure they were still attached to my body. To the point that I couldn't remember who my bf was. All the undealt anger, worries, sorrow, pain... They all went on stage.

I tried to manage it for months, convincing myself that 'I was only young, I was under stress, when people have changes in their lives they feel lost and that's totally normal' except it wasn't. Big mistake 1.

I tried to compansate by taking vitamins, reading self-growth books, doing yoga, eating better food, etc. Although they helped temporarily, they couldn't stop panic attacks from taking over. I relied on them so much, convinced myself that I only needed to get stronger and ignored all the signs that screamed I was drowning. Big mistake 2.

Deep down, I knew that if I didn't have anyone that relied on me, I would just end it because I had no other reason to live. I didn't recognize who I was as anxiety stole the opportunities of exploring myself, couldn't remember my memories or they didn't mean anything to me. What was I but a ghost in a shell?
And even to my bf I kept pretending like it was just stress getting to me. Or usual jealousy of girls, y'know. Big mistake 3.

Last week, I was so tired of my emotions changing every hour (no exaggeration here) I said fuck it. Fuck all of it. Fuck feeling sad, anxious, miserable, unwanted, paranoid, not enough. Fuck feeling drained, empty, like a robot, stuck in a bell jar. Fuck not being able to step away from my room. Fuck self harm. And got a doctor's appointment.
When I went to the hospital 5 days ago, the lady on the reception said that I didn't seem to have any appointments that day. I was crushed. I came in the wrong day and wasted all my energy to amp myself up, prepare to face it. I started crying in the garden of the hospital and went home. I fucked it up again, I was the worst. I couldn't even properly visit a doctor, like a malfunctioning machine I was no use to anyone.
When I went home I asked one of my close friends to join me on my next appointment. We couldn't meet frequently so I knew putting her in the loop would help me get back up and I wouldn't ditch her. 

So yesterday, before the appointment we grabbed coffee and had sweet small talk. Then I went into the doctor's and saw that my psychiatry doctor was the sweetest, most understanding and professional person I have ever seen. She told me that if it had been managable, I would've handled it a long time ago and I wouldn't have to come here. She congratulated me for my concious efforts to stay on top of it and assured me that in a month, I will be in a better place. And prescribed me drugs.

I've taken my first drug today.

The point is, you don't have to feel lost and down. You are not weak or naive for wanting to get professional help. Quite the contrary, you are brave for opening up to a perfect stranger and letting them touch your wounds for braveness only comes when there is fear. 

You should get help before things get way worse or it will be an uphill battle to get back. Drugs and medicines won't make you less aware, less of a human. They will lift your quality of life and you will find the acceptance that you search for in your heart. Living shouldn't become surviving and surviving shouldn't become this exhausting task that you don't feel like doing anymore. 
Is it too cheesy? Well, maybe it is but I have nothing but hope and I plan to cling to it with all my strength. ",28Jun2018,3
43,"I'm looking for serious advice when posting this. I feel like i have run out of options with how to fix my mental health. Let me explain what is going on with.  

Wayward thoughts
I have intrusive thoughts of hurting loved ones. Now after the years of battling my issues, i have suicidal like thoughts. Not necessarily me doing it. Me in the act without the want of contemplating it.

My mind races faster than life. I want to do this that this that thisthattthisthatthisthatthatthatthat. And i get way to ahead of myself. And go into doing stuff without a plan.

When i get something in my mind that i want to do. I'm set on it. When it doesn't go my way. I'm so let down. 

From the moment I'm awake, I'm already miserable. From the moment I lay down, I'm tired. 

I dwell on things. Like if someone hurts my feelings, it takes forever to get over it. Or if something bothers me, i just cant move on. I'm easily bothered. 

I get anxious. Like if i have said something that i regret. I feel like the other partys feelings are hurt or they hate me. 

Fear of forgetting is an anxiety. Actually forgetting just sucks. 

Dark heart
I'm angry. I'm bitter. I feel hopeless. I look at the glass empty. I don't feel like life will ever change for the better or the way i want. 

I have dreams. I have creative ideas. So i write it down. Work on it for a little bit. Then when things slow down, i give up. Or if I'm down i will shred my ideas. 

I've been giving up on my interests. They haven't been keeping me happy lately. 

I don't know my worth. I don't think i could do anything important to this world. I matter to people. I sometimes i believe i could contribute more to the world. Or is that illusions of grandeur?

I hate my job. I left this job once. Went to another job that sucked. Went back to other job. Now i feel like I'm stucked. If employers don't think I'm skilled or talented then i don't. 

Green with envy
I'm envious of friends and family and coworkers that are ahead of me in life.

What I want you to understand is that everything I'm explaining isnt minor inconvenience. Everything will ruin my day. Bring me down to the point i go home and lay in bed and i have no energy. I'm just mentally exhausted. Lost in my toxic thoughts.

The one thing i can describe is my mind is loud. Millions of thoughts, tons of feelings, waves of negativity in my body.

When it started
September 2014, i started dating a girl from another state. August 2015, she moved to live with me. Since then I've been going downhill. I'm married to her now. She stands by my side. And watch as i battle my demons.  I love her. I don't know if my life change caused me to lose it. 

Help history
I've done 3 different counselors. I've been to a psychiatrist. 7 antidepressants. Nothing ever helped. 

Things I've tried to relieve stress
I've tried essential oils. Trying to play drums as a release. Its getting hard to focus. I've tried Mary Jane. It did sort of help. But I'm job searching. 

There are a million things i want to put in here. I took a couple days to write this down. I don't want to push people away. Especially my wife. She tells me she's staying by my side. But I've been getting worse since 2015. There's potential for worse. I have many enemies in this war. 

I've always thought i was OCD. But i don't know. Never truly diagnosed. I'm trying to find someone to tell me what it is and what i could do. Traditional medicine failed me. ",28Jun2018,1

47,"I’m 23 years old and I just can’t get motivated anymore. The only motivation I have is looking for a job (I lost my job three months ago). But when it comes to my own health, I really couldn’t care.

I don’t do drugs anymore, and I’m lucky to drink once a month. Even when I do I only have a few. My biggest problem are cigarettes. I started smoking when I was 14 and I quit when I was 18. Not because of the health issues I would have later in life but just because I didn’t enjoy it anymore.

I didn’t smoke again until I was twenty and fell back to it because of excessive alcohol and drug use. Now I don’t drink and take drugs it’s the last vice that I have left. I’m still at a point where I enjoy it, I’ve thought about quitting several times but I honestly can’t be fucked. I like it. I love going outside for a smoke or having one while I’m driving the car.

Since I started smoking again I smoke more heavily. Depending on what’s happening on the day and stress levels I can smoke up to 40 a day although the usual is about 15 - 20.

I just walked down the hallway to tuck my fiancé into bed because she fell asleep on the couch. I walked back into the lounge room, laid down and felt out of breath.

I’m also overweight now more than I have ever been. I’ve always been fat but I was always heavily into sports, mainly rugby league and martial arts. I’m worried that my smoking habit and being overweight will kill me before I’m thirty, before my fiancé and I have kids. But yet, I do nothing about it. 

I’m the sort of guy that needs to do thing with a mate or have one supporting me. My fiancé tries to support but if I slip and have a smoke all she does is nag me and I just go “fuck it” and have another because my stress goes through the roof. I’ve spoken to her about it before but it hasn’t changed and that’s fair enough.

I have a mate who I use to do martial arts with, him and I made all these plans of him helping me out at the gym and helping me out with quitting smoking by supporting me. Which was fine, until I met his partner.

We all went to school together so she knows all about my past. I was arrested twice by the time I was sixteen for several different felonies. My life has changed however I never here from him anymore since we all had dinner one night so I’m pretty sure she doesn’t want me hanging around him.

I don’t know what to do. I have no motivation towards getting my health better and getting in shape again. Honestly sometime I just want to die so all the pain ends (physical and mental pain). I’ve reached out to several different doctors where I love and none of them are providing me aid with my mental problems and I don’t take painkillers for my physical problems due to former drug abuse.

I’m stumped on what to do. This probably isn’t even the right place to be posting this, so I’m sorry about that. But I just needed to get all of this off of my chest.

I was to the point that I couldn't go to friends house's for longer than a few hours without having a panic attack. I never could stay the night anywhere until I was around 16 because I would get so anxious. I have never been to a mental health professional to receive a diagnosis, but this is what I have observed and I don't know what to do. 

I am often very anxious and panic, very low moods (I feel like I'm operating at 50% or less... if that makes sense). I don't really have mood swings but I do get angry very easily. I am a hypochondriac and get upset very easily.

50,"After exhausting almost every therapy option and inpatient treatment the last 15 years trying to treat my major depression and PTSD. I was in crisis and suicidal.

57,"I recently left a long term relationship. Still deeply in love with one another but at the same time so deeply disturbed with ourselves, we determined to take a break to work on ourselves so that one day we might be able to continue this story in a healthy way. That much is okay. I know this path towards self-discovery might mean that resume button never appears, but the last few days have got me thinking about the rest of my life, and I'm concerned that if I don't take appropriate action, I will constantly end up in confusing situations with only hindsight to inform me that the root of the situation was projection of my innermost fears and flaws.

I'm curious if pursuing this path is inherently opposite to the function of it. I've developed a reading list to try and answer some fundamental questions about myself, but I'm concerned that answering these questions isn't the ultimate solution.

59,"It's a funny little phrase to start anything like this on, innit? You just know it'll mean more by the time we're done here - Some part of your mind can sense the concepts latching on, attaching, hoarding houris hounding human handshake protocols. To me the word means taking a few concepts, a few metaphors, and finding a word in a\*nother language that represents that. And the little asterisk there is the Q-bit in the whole thing that threatans, physics breaking style, to smash the whole process wide open if you drill down into it. It's the ""What happens when we tug two atoms apart?"" kind of question, what is that asterisk and what does it represent, that it's kind of hard to convey the scale of the idea here inside my head. I can't quite put it into my fingers and out onto the screen.

Because it's the problem here. As translated through the dopamine establishment and reward system bypasses and redirects a damaged and traumatized mind comes up with. I'm not shitting around when I say Addicted to Translation by as you can see, the nuance and context and meaning of these two words is rather expansive. And in order to convey, properly, what it is I mean when I say all of this, we're going to need to have a little conversation about Language. May as well start at zero, go all the way down to the bottom, and work out a way back up - I know, it sounds silly and a bit much right now, but bear with me here, we'll try and make it at least a little moment to moment engaging.

So. I've recently put two and two together on an aspect of what Social Roles are - They're not roles or plays or assignments or anything like that at all, and every concept attached to them is bad data scramble poured on top with some interestingly jagged angles attaching. So sweep it clean, and brush it aside, and what it is we see underlaying the actual idea? When we speak about social roles, we're actually speaking about ""Hey, we're talking the same language here"" and whether that phrase is a nice green checkmark for both people. It so happens that speaking language is tricky, thinking about language has a lot more tricks, but then describing it is yet another layer of complexity up, and then we get to making language up whole cloth - Which is sort of accidentally what I've wound up figuring out is the thing my brain thinks Is The Best Thing. Every time I really properly GET IT and wrap my head around a concept and communicate it and formalize and describe and convey and understand and all that bundled together is THE BEST THING on a primal, child-like scream, howling level from my biology right on up to my brainstem. Everything in me wants to jump up and down and ramble about it for fifty hours straight.

So when I say I'm Addicted to Translation I'm starting to wonder and worry. And I listen to stuff like the things discussed here and it's... Producing a pondering. That I can't quite articulate, and I'm hoping to get some review. It's like, addicted in the way Sonichu's chris-chan is Addicted to Sonic, or the guy who got tattoos and injections enough to look catlike is Addicted to that idea, my brain is LATCHING onto this process and hugging it like a dopamine fiend. It feels like I've finally got a name for What Makes Me Happy.

Next-20-min-Edit- : So. The Act of Being Addicted to Translation. Turns the whole three-four paragraphs into 5 actual words with the grammatic detritus of our language making up the joints between those core concepts totally not counting. I mean seriously who counts a ""The"" or a ""of"" in these things. Language is silly. Anyways. That process - everything surrounding it, sounding the ideas out, testing them, communicating them, thinking about how one idea relates to another, stretching the metaphorical boundries of metaphors and how it is we communicate ideas - It's great. In a real sense it's the whole of what being human is, and then when I realize I'm reaching into shmaltzy territory and actually start internally checking my internal emotional language on all this - it reads with the eyes-blazing anime-abstract hype-machine emotional tones one would expect to hear out of a total burnout expounding on the value of weeeed maaaaan. So is ""addiction"" even the right word? Is ""translation""? I've been doing some reading on dopamine systems, and that seems like an indicator - But then again, I'm ALSO processing and recontextualizing a hell of a lot of old drama/trauma over this like last week or two, which might just be causing chemical spills as I slosh the goddamn buckets around re-thinking things.

9:14 - So what's the thing to worry about, then? Why use such alarmist words for the sensation and concept? I mean clearly some part of my instincts are reaching for my attention. And taking care of Self is a bit like Piloting a Meat Suit - you kind of have to empathize with it, treat it like a great big puppy dog, yeah? The ideas it produces don't always translate well to our selves. Bah. That metaphor is messy. It feels like I'm trying to use thoughts to turn humanity into words.

Trying to perform Rumplestiltskin's Spin on the Sensations of Self. Only it doesn't quite work like that, when you attempt to perform the technique, does it? One potential worry, a way the trick can fail, is this.... Error-Comedy-Dissection-style-paralell - The only other concept ratcheting to mind is Error:Frog-Understanding-Is-Frog-Killing. I'm sounding out metaphors there when I do that, and like immediately discarding them, via recognizing them as errors. Close-at-hand enough to be the ideas reached for, but not properly executing on the concept in deeper scan. Hrmn. I've often described the cognative problems with being so Spergy is like having too much cache, a bunch of unchecked macros, and not much ram to speak of and no bloody pagefile.By now I've started timestamping the paragraphs, this one's five minutes after the stop of thelast one, but really, it's just caus I'm wondering how long it is I'm sitting here in this wild, burning, spun up fuge state of thinking as fast as I goddamn can like it's a drug bender and I'm trying to sort myself out. It isn't, for reference. That's the worry, the reason it's nagging at me - Sitting here, being chill, sort of psuedophilosophically rambling about the nature of ideas and how perception and translation and packing big ideas into little ones and resolution management tricks, let alone recognizing formatting in the text doc sense and formatting in the hard drive bytestructure sense, this is a fairly low even tone all things considered. Because there have been times in the last week, as I'm starting to examine and think about this shit, and inexpertly slam ideas at a wall testing them, because I've realized a gross and deep seated misapplication of social roles. I am not a profesional in any of these fields, I am a shlubby 30 something archtypical normal guy working a tech support job with a mildly distinct hairdo and facial hair set - the portland crowd character you're already bored of hearing the description for, just trying to figure out how to be less of a jerk to people caus I've traditionally failed to, you know, recognize that any of the above ideas even existed. Poor upbringing, which is probably the point to turn this from what started as a light open air ramble about a question I'm having trouble formulating, from the weird struggling to cogit breakdown, into the personal realm, which means the diatribe stops here. Apologies for dragging you all on that road with me - But the actual question at the top here is - Is this an actual relevent concept? Recognizable to anyone here?

And... Yes, for the last two weeks, this 51 minute fuge state of trying to get ONE question out, coherently, whole, with full proper elaboration - And boiling it all down into ""I'm starting to worry I'm actually growing Addicted to Translation, or rather, have ALWAYS been and only just now realized it's been the one thing that made any conceptual existence remotely bearable and its so abstract and weird yes that does imply I was given so little to work with as a kid they thought I was SPED - That spun up worry state has been pretty much my 24/7, once I started grappling with the edges of it. So I'm a bit worried - The manic/weirder swings here turn agressive and unpleasant, a sort of Sperg Rage that I imagine is recognizable to anyone whose actually read the whole thing. So, yeah, trying to figure out how to translate things so as not to do that.",28Jun2018,3

61,"I feel so jittery and unstable. It's the self-doubt that really impedes me, it completely takes over and I feel like I don't know the person inside my own skin and want to jump out of it. So many panic attacks, leading to despair and exhaustion. Imagine being able to have a thought and carry that thought to its natural conclusion, without the paralysing voice in your head telling you what a stupid and inane and feckless thought it is to have? Imagine being able to finish reading a page of a book without that same voice telling you the book wasn't written for the likes of you, that you aren't capable of engaging with it on any intellectual or emotional level, because you live in a black hole where nothing good or right ever gets born, things only die upon unwitting entry. Imagine having a conversation with someone without the sense of shame and humiliation washing over you the moment its over, the knowledge that you've revealed yourself to be the grotesque freak that they always suspected you were?

I know there's no logic to these feelings, but they prevail, and try as I might to conquer them through reason, the conviction behind them (I don't know where it comes from, its origins are unknown, which only serves to compound its omnipotence, to more thickly shroud its existence in mystery) fortifies them completely. I was meant to go to a music show today of a close friend. I didn't go because I was hyperventilating into a bag and seeing stars, nearing a black-out. I let them down. People dislike me,and rightfully so- I'm a shit friend, who prioritises nobody above my own pathetic feelings of worthlessness and self-pity.

63,"I think I’ve finally figured out why I’m so dominant in relationships. So, every time I have a boyfriend, the people around me notice that I’m the one always making decisions, I’m the one who decides when the relationship moves forward, and I’m the one who ends it. They say that maybe I should step back, and let my partner decide, which it’s not like I control them. I don’t tell them what they can and can’t do, but it’s like I’m always the alpha in the relationship. 

I mean, don’t get me wrong I let them make decisions to, but I don’t know how to explain it it’s weird. Like if my partner and I want to move to 2nd base, or just take the next step in the relationship, I initiate it, because if they do it first my stupid brain decides that it doesn’t feel right. Or when things start to go south, I immediately end it. I don’t try to work things out, sometimes I really want to, but for some reason once I’m done I’m done. I tried getting back together one time, but every time I would look at that person’s face it would remind of the hurt they put me through. 

The other night, my mom brought this to my attention again, and I just blurted out, “I can’t stand it when they leave me, I have to leave them.” After thinking what I said over, the realization hit me like a truck. 

When I was 9 years old my bio dad decided he didn’t want to see me anymore. It went from visitations every other weekend religiously, then he signed over his rights, and I never saw him again. He never said I love you or anything  before he handed me over to my mom. He couldn’t even look me in the eye. I realized that the deep pit of hurt in my stomach that I felt after I learned he basically left me, is the same hurt I feel when a guy dumps me. I remember for a long time after my bio dad left me, I felt that if I was in control I could have stopped it. If I was the one to decide, he wouldn’t have given me up. Eventually those thoughts turned into anger as I grew older. Now I absolutely despise him, and still want to catch him out one day and just lay out how I feel towards him. 

I believe that that event, has shaped my mentality towards the men in my relationships. The anger I feel towards the men who have dumped me, stems back to him. And I just feel that if I can tell my bio dad what a dick he was and how much he fucked me up, that maybe I would feel better. I don’t know though, that’s why I’m here. ",28Jun2018,2

I am anxious the whole day before the internship thinking about having to go and am always thinking of ways to get out of going or when I am there, thinking of ways that I can leave early. It makes me so incredibly anxious and I dread going so much that I want to cry thinking about going in each day - even though I think I would enjoy that field later in life. 

The thing is, my parents absolutely won't let me quit or even cut my days down to even two days a week. I haven't told them straight up how much anxiety it causes me but I express my unhappiness going but they say that ""I have made a commitment"", all the possible connections I can make for the future, and keep talking about how much it will look good on a resume, and they are correct in all of that but it still doesn't help that I hate going so much.

69,I have depression. Self diagnosed about 13 years go. In the last 2 years I tried wellbutrin for 3 or 4 months but it didnt do anything at all.I'm not sure of the dose. Also 60 mg of cymbalta for about a week but had sexual side effects after just 1 dose. So I've pretty much just been dealing with it on my own. But the symptoms are kind of beyond what I would consider classic depression. I pretty much have 2 settings. On and off. And its not to saying any bit productive when I'm on.

Basically, I firmly, in my heart, believe that ALL men are dangerous in any type of romantic or sexual context. I strongly believe that within every man is a desire to rape, and often even a desire to rape or otherwise abuse children. I believe that any man who thinks he is different and “safe” to be around, is only in denial about their true self, and that they are merely a predator in waiting, to someday be set off by something or someone, at which time the predator within them will be realized. 

I am horrified seeing men on dates with women. I hate hearing about or thinking about men having sex with women. I cant help but worry whether or not any coersion happened, whether the woman was actually comfortable, whether he lied to her to get in her pants. It goes on. I am horrified and disgusted by it. 

So basically the core belief behind it is that all men, whether they realize it or not, are sexual predators and/or pedophiles. 

How unreasonable is that ? Is it ridiculous enough to be a non-bizarre delusion? Am i paranoid? Is this just a normal abuse survivor thing? I know other women who survived childhood sexual abuse like i did, and they still are able to have men as friends, or even date men…. I just don’t know. Even if im shown evidence that im wrong i can not shake this core belief. There is literally no way to without any uncertainty prove that this belief of mine is wrong. 

Can anyone relate to this? Or just tell me im delusional. I dont know. I feel very isolated.

77,"Trust me, I've been there. You’ve felt it for weeks, creeping up on you like a weed. Or, something just went terribly wrong that caused a complete breakdown.

No matter who you are, you have probably “crashed and burned.” 

Even the strongest of us can get overwhelmed with life’s sporadic emergencies, constant stress, and our own personal triggers.

Perhaps your work has been grinding you into the ground. Maybe a failed relationship has thrown your emotions into shambles. 

Or, you’re spending just a little too much time thinking about how life is meaningless (PS: The meaning of life is to give your life meaning. But that’s a talk for another time).

You need an immediate boost to get yourself back on track. 

Break out your emergency mental and physical health toolkit.

**I created a toolkit template filled with activities I consistently use to drastically increase my self-esteem, lower my anxiety and depression, as well as force my body back into healthy cooperation.** 

You can run through my program exactly, or use it as a jumping off point.

This will be a single day program. 

You can still work or take care of errands in between these tasks, but it would be ideal to take the day off or use this toolkit on the weekend.

## MORNING

**1.** Wake up at a reasonable hour. Only you know what this means to you, but do not sleep in. Conversely, do not under-sleep. This will drastically effect your mental health during the day. Find the sweet spot that makes you feel accomplished and rested.

**2.** You will be staying off social media and news websites for the entire day. Remove yourself from technology as much as possible, using it only for work.

**3.** Start the day with this breathing and movement exercise. This will lower your stress hormone, cortisol, which is high in the mornings:

**A.** Stand with your feet separated a bit wider than your shoulders.

**B.** Exhale and slowly bend forward with your arms crossed around your chest. Squeeze your hands into fists to relieve tension in the spine. Feel the muscles that are stretching, and rate your exertion between 1-10. Don’t go past 7.

**C.** Inhale and gradually “roll” upward to standing position, vertebrae by vertebrae. Raise your arms outward and upward in a V, even stretching your fingers to the sky. Fill your lungs to capacity, and hold your breath for a few moments in this position.

**D.** Exhale, and slowly let your arms drop while extended. Let out as much air as you possibly can while you repeat this process for at least a few minutes.

**4.** You will perform two fitness activities today, one in the morning and one in the evening. Select the most difficult of your chosen activities now, when your willpower is strongest. You may want to run, go to the gym, do a yoga routine, or a bike ride.

To make this easy, I recommend [darebee.com](http://darebee.com/), which is a phenomenal website filled with well designed bodyweight workouts. Pick a program that fits your current skill level and push through it. If none of this is possible, actively stretch or take a long walk.

**5.** After exercise, sit down for 10 minutes of meditation, preferably in a relaxing, quiet, outdoor space. Use a meditation guidance track on your headphones to help you get the best out of these ten minutes. Calm your mind as best as you can.

**6.** Open up a journal and write down a page of your thoughts. Complain, talk to yourself, and just get it all out. Then, follow a formula:

**A.** Gratitude. Write down three things you can be grateful for, and why. This could be as simple as your working two legs, a home over your head, and food to eat. Or, you might be grateful for a supportive family, a good job, and a great place to live.

**B.** Vision. Write about five years in the future. Where are you going to be, and what will that feel like? Shoot high and stay positive. Remember the classic question, “Will what is happening today really matter in five years?” If not, take a deep breath and write out a great story for yourself. [The 5-1-30 goal setting one-pager worksheet I made can help with this.](https://conquer.today/5-1-30/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=5+1+30&amp;utm_content=5+1+30&amp;utm_term=mental+health)

**C.** Others. There are people out there struggling just like you. That doesn’t make your challenges any less significant: it just means that you are never alone. Write down other people you know who need support and kindness. Give them your full attention and wish them well. (Bonus points for shooting them a text to say hello.)

**7.** When getting ready for the day, incorporate a cold shower. It doesn’t have to be for the entire time, but when you are ready to get out, turn the nozzle to cold and stand under it for 30-60 seconds.

This activity will jolt your system to provide a rush of energy and adrenaline. Many of those struggling with sluggishness and a foggy mind will appreciate this step.

**8.** Have the best possible breakfast you can. Make it filling, healthy, and simple to make. Bacon and eggs with juice, a low-sugar fruit smoothie with protein, or almond butter and english muffins can help you jump start the day.[ I've also created the simplest, easiest, and cheapest meal plan for high quality nutrition here.](https://conquer.today/easiest-cheapest-peak-nutrition-meal-plan-ever/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=meal+plan&amp;utm_content=meal+plan&amp;utm_term=mental+health)

## DAYTIME

Since most of us work, this time will probably be taken up by other pressing activities. Make sure to maintain a calm, healthy demeanor during this period.

Here are a few activities that you can use to stay balanced:

**A.** Take two minutes to breathe deeply multiple times a day

**B.** Listen to nature sounds on your headphones while working

**C.** Follow a to-do list without getting distracted by less urgent things

**D.** Stretch and walk around the block multiple times a day

**E.** Drink only water, tea, and coffee

**F.** Have a healthy lunch, avoiding bread and sugar

If this is a weekend or you are not working, you must still get out of the house. Go to a coffee shop or a library to read a book, or check off simple errands like dropping off laundry and mowing the lawn. You will feel much better in the evening if you have accomplished something.

## EVENING

Time to close out our mental and physical emergency health tool kit with a few evening activities. Stay strong, this is the home stretch which will cap off your reset and give you the boost you need to keep moving forward!

**1.** As soon as possible, complete your second fitness activity. Again, you could run, hit the gym, or take a long bike ride. Make sure you open your lungs and work hard. You’re going to sleep well tonight.

You are completing two fitness activities for a few of reasons. First, you want to make sure you are getting the essential endorphin boost that can literally transform your negative emotions on a dime. Doubling up on exercise is the best way to do this, fast.

Second, it’s important that you know, even in your worst of days, you can do much more than you ever thought possible. You don’t have to work out twice a day all the time: but now you know you can.

**2.** Cook yourself a healthy, filling dinner. You may be tempted to go for junk food or a pizza to make yourself feel better at the end of the day, but it will have the opposite effect.

**3.** Put away your items and prepare for the next day. This is an essential step, and will make tomorrow much easier. Pick out your outfit, pack a lunch, and write out a detailed to-do list. Make sure your home is organized and ready. 

**4.** Finally, take 10 more minutes of meditation before bed. Deep breathing here will allow you to fall asleep faster, and remove the lingering anxiety that has come on though the day.

## MOVING FORWARD

I also wrote a 160 page book that might help I never published called [Kaizen Habits you can just download here.](https://conquer.today/kaizen-habits-27-skills-master-powerful-mind-body-life/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=kaizen+habits&amp;utm_content=kaizen+habits&amp;utm_term=mental+health) It's filled with 27 mind, body, and life habits just like the ones above that are meant to give us what I call a ""stainless steel mind and a body machine.""

I'm also trying to launch a subreddit at r/conquertoday where we can support each other, share good information, and I can publish more of my research. Please join me and give me advice on how I can help reach and serve more people?

Depending on how burnt out you feel, you might want to repeat this toolkit a few days in a row! If you stay positive and trust this process, you should feel significantly better than you did yesterday. 

Just keep moving, and learn to enjoy the constant struggle that is life. I'm here for you, this forum is here for you, and we're all in this together.

79,"I have a past of mental illness: a mix of psychosis, OCD, and depression.
I've been feeling well for the last couple years, but I've had 2 relapses before in my life, so I have to keep that in mind.

That being said, I've been toying with the idea of seeing a hypnotist (hypnotherapist?) to help me deal with some other issues that are holding me back in life (I'm also actively working on my self improvement (soports, reading...), but I feel like that extra hypno push is just what I need.

However, I've had something kind'a similar done in the past (some kind of bioenergy..? - It was long ago, so I don't remember) and while it was supppsed to help me fight mental illness, it actually worsened my psychosis. I told my therapist about it and they told me such things are not safe for mentally ill people, but again, it wasn't *exactly* hypnosis. I googled whether hypnosis is safe for the mentally ill, but got no conclusive answers.

So now I'd like to ask: have any of you dealt with similar mental illnesses and been hypnotised? How did it work out for you? Thank you for your time.",28Jun2018,1

83,"1mg x 3 times daily of Xanax and 10mg 3 x times daily of Valium for the past 2 years. I don't mind taking them. They have never been the gateway drugs that I've been told they are. They work for my anxiety and panic disorder. They don't make me put on weight. But my doctor still doesn't want me on them anymore. My only decision is them or nothing. I won't start taking anti depressants again because of the weight gain. 

Do you know of the best choice of words to say to him? Any suggestions of another drug that can be prescribed in Ireland that doesn't cause weight gain and other bad side effects? I am happy to continue taking these pills but he isn't, which I don't understand. They work and they are the only tablets that have worked for me. I don't want to get into an uncomfortable and heated argument with him over them.

He told me that I am looking at up to 6 months to come completely off of them...

84,"Wasn't sure where to post this so I'll post here. Brace yourself it's a strange post.

I'm 21, never had a girlfriend, never had sex. Completely undesirable, no redeemable qualities whatsoever, complete lack of self esteem and social skills. I have too much emotional baggage and I know for a fact I'll never have a girlfriend (I blame myself for my shortcomings, I'm not trying to blame anybody here.) So, what is the fucking point of even having a sex drive? I'm never gonna use it anyway. It's a total distraction, I'm on SSRI meds and they've reduced my libido somewhat but I want it totally gone. All my friends are finding partners and I have nobody, again that's my fault and nobody else's, but I feel so worthless, might as well just cut my losses and get castrated, at least then I won't have to deal with my body's incessant urges. 

Also, another factor is male pattern baldness. Luckily I haven't lost my hair yet, but my father's side of the family does have the baldness gene, so there's a chance I could inherit it. There's no way in hell I'm going to just stand by and lose my hair, it's pretty much all I have. I'd sooner lose my testicles.

87,"Hi, I've been meaning to ask this for some time but havent known where or who to ask, but is it normal to want to die? 

I wouldn't consider myself to be suicidal, hence not having been to see my GP. Although I have thought about suicide on the odd occasion, I have never been in a crisis situation and I know that I would never attempt to kill myself. 

The urge to die is more general, as in I want to stop existing or for something out of my control to happen to me like being hit by a car. While I know how awful and selfish this sounds, I cant help but feel like this. I usually have these thoughts multiple times a day, and while they arent that serious they really prevent me from enjoying myself or doing anything remotely productive. 

I've had these thoughts for around two years now, and I honestly just want to be able to enjoy my life but it currently seems impossible. No matter what happens or what I achieve, it doesnt seem very meaninngful or significant.
