0,"I'm not sure what this is or if it's even real but I don't know and it's sometimes driving me crazy. Slowly, but surely, I think. 

I was just ordering pizza and I said ""no mushrooms"", the person taking the order seemed new and I remember he said ""no mushrooooms"" over and over in a weird calm voice while I zoned out because he said it so weird. Then he laughed and said ""ok I'll be sure they aren't on there."" I immediately thought he was writing it or something and that's why he said it weird. 

Then I said that was weird to my family next to me and they asked what was all that about. 

When they said that I realised I might have zoned out and said ""no mushrooms""  in a weird calm voice over and over. The voice I thought came from the phone was actually me. Now that I think about it I can't even recall the moment very well. And on my head it makes much more sense considering my family's reaction and the laughter and general weirdness of the person over the phone after it happened. 

Is that weird? I can't even recall what happened. I don't even know if I said it. I can't remember the moment. It gives me anxiety and sadness thinking about it. I want to ask if I did but then I'd just seem crazy. I just can't know. 

If this happens more frequently I'm not sure how I'll get by. 

If this isn't a big deal or irrelevant to the subreddit I'm sorry. Just let me know. All I know is it's bothering me greatly and I don't even know if it happened.",15Dec2018,1
1,"The hare checklist for psychopathy. Scores from 0-40 based on each check getting a score from 0-2. Here are my results:

Superficial charm: 1-2. This is hard for me. What is ""normal""? I feel am very charismatic when it serves me, but of course I don't actually *mean* whatever I am showing. 1?

Grandiose sense of self: 1-2. Again this is hard for me. There is line between internally grandiosity and external. I feel internally I have a very high opinion of myself, but my efforts to act humble seem to come from my desire for people to believe that I am humble. Am I tricking myself?

Need for stimulation: 2

Pathological lying: Lying about what exactly? Lying to my girlfriend about being faithful? In that case, 2 all the way. But overall I don't think I have too much to lie about. Then again I have no problem lying to anybody when it comes to protecting my ego. Let's say, 1?

Cunning and manipulativeness: 2, when I need to be. 

Lack of remorse or guilt: 1

Callousness and lack of empathy: 1

Superficial emotional responses: 2

Parasitic lifestyle: 0

Poor behavioral controls: 0

Sexual promiscuity: is there a ""3"" option? 2.

Early behavior problems: 1. I've always been ""smart"" about my misbehavior.

Lack of realistic long term goals: Eh, 0. I just don't stress anymore about the future. I plan for it and I want to acheive my ideas of success. (Maybe have a family, have friends, have nice possessions. But most importantly, have a lot of amazing experiences under my belt.

Impulsivity: 1. This used to be much worse. I'm grown and matured and usually think things through. Definitely lean towards being an instant gratification guy.

Irresponsibility: Tough one. I really don't know. 0.

Failure to accept responsibility for actions: 0. I have no problem telling you that I fucked up. But then again I almost feel empowered by this. Like ""yeah, that was me, whoopsies."" 

Many short term marital relationships: 0-1. I am young. Have not had much experience. What I can tell you is that I can get attached/move on with women very easily, it seems. 

Juvenile deliquency: 0-1. I think there's a difference between misbehavior without getting caught, and ending up in juvy. I was never caught doing anything and never would've been labeled as a deliquent. Drugs, mischeif, the law never got me 

The last two are: 
revocation of conditional release

criminal versatility

Not entirely sure what these mean. 

Since I gave some of these items multiple answers, I'll give you two totals for my score. Both of these totals do not account for the last two checklist items since I'm not sure how to answer.

Low end score: 15/36
High end score: 20/36

It feels like I can go so many ways with my answers. What feels normal to me might be shockingly abnormal to you, and to what the baseline criteria should be for this test.

I'll give you other examples of myself that are not in this checklist. 

I have an extremely rageful side to me. Compare it to the hulk. What's crazy is I actually feel *alive* when I am rageful. 

When I had a girlfriend, I cheated on her willingly and without much remorse, multiple times. Women feel like interchange sexual objects to me. 

I've always found it hard and a little ""icky"" to truly connect with people and share my deepest parts of me. I like to think that I want close relationships. But when I really think about it, I just want to be loved/praised and I just want to have fun with other people that are like me. I can't stand when someone I know has a bad opinion of me. 

I feel like I don't really know myself. I mean, I do, but when it comes to my psychopathic traits, I feel that I have nothing to compare myself to. All I've ever known was how to be me.

I have pieces to my puzzle, but I don't know what other pieces you need to figure me out. You may need to ask me questions, I would like that very much. The whole ""me"" definitely can't be expressed with just this post. 

I do have an empathetic side. But I feel that I have a switch, like I'm able to override my empathy when I need to. 

If anyone out there is willing to talk about this with me, I would greatly appreciate it :) 

I would really really like to go into more detail about any thing you'd like to ask me. There is simply not enough space to write everything.

I'm feeling rather lost and broken at the moment. I thought I had things figured out, bit I can't escape who I am. I always come back to this. If I knew I had a real mental disorder of this sort, I could come to peace with it. For now, I just feel confused about myself. It's like my parents told me who I was and who I'm supposed to be, but in my adulthood I realized that I am not what they wish I was.

2,"I have been court ordered for my local mental health service and I am ordered until 4/19. I never missed an appointment and my therapist quit or got fired in October. So the last time I was seen was in September. They set me up with an appointment today on 12/14 at 4PM. I know this because when I went to my October appointment they told me that my therapist wasn't in and he would call me - well he never did and instead i received a letter in the mail about my new appointment on 12/14. So I called on 11/30 to reschedule and they told me I could not because ""We can't schedule you that far out with you being on a court order."" But they did send my on to the therapists voicemail where I left a voicemail asking to be put a list in case someone were to cancel so I could fill that spot. Well no one called me back so I took PTO and went in for my 4:00PM appointment and they told me that it was cancelled and they would have to notify the court that ""I cancelled my appointment"" When I never cancelled it and I was there, ON TIME - So I asked to file a complaint and the manager there simply said that she spoke with the court liaison and that it would be okay for me to come to a make-up appointment on 1/22/19. I am not okay with this - I need to see a therapist and since I have no insurance I have no options. I am not at risk but I have a lot of processing to do and having a professional would help greatly. Not to mention it takes a few appointments for me to even get comfortable enough to really talk with a therapist. What are my options? Can I go complain to the probate court on Monday when they open? The Manager brushed off my complaint - never wrote anything down and just politely said that it would be fine that I can just go to my appointment on 1/22/19. How do I know they are ""notifying"" the court the truth? About their lack of communication and how they seriously dropped the ball?

5,"Hey Reddit,

A bit of background on this situation:

My friend is currently in his mid to late twenties in the US. Sometime around when we were getting ready to graduate from high school, he began to show some disturbed behavior. He began claiming that he was the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, an important figure in Tibetan Buddhism. He began writing long, rambling, nonsensical documents and insisting on handing them out to people in shopping malls and other public places. At the same time, he was experiencing auditory hallucinations. At first, random beeps and noises. As his psychosis progressed, he claimed that he was able to hear people's thoughts while looking at their faces, either in person or in pictures. He ended up being institutionalized after graduation. I don't really know the circumstances of that as to whether it was voluntary, as it was very hard to keep in touch with him in this state. Possibly worth noting is that his older brother began showing equally disturbing behavior at almost the exact same age and also spent time in a mental health facility. I don't know if his brother had delusions of grandeur.

I did hang out with him again about a year later, and he was very much in remission (if that's the correct term). He didn't really go into depth on his treatment, and I didn't press as I was just glad he seemed to be okay (and it was none of my business). I haven't seen or talked to him since.

On to what is happening currently:

After not being active on Facebook for the better part of a year, he recently began posting the same kind of rambling nonsense, and with steadily increasing regularity. He is once again claiming to be the Panchen Lama, and is also claiming to possess advanced degrees, knighthood, and other titles. He is claiming to have designed microchips on the International Space Station, that he is in the process of developing anti-gravity, that the fundamental nature of the universe is color... You get it. Rambling, incoherent nonsense with random capitalization interspersed with frequently changing profile and banner pictures depicting various Buddhas. I have screenshotted examples and removed his personal info, but am reluctant to post any unless they'd be of assistance in getting him help. I will add that one of his last healthy posts before his absence was announcing that he had quit smoking cigarettes, and I've heard anecdotes of nicotine cessation wreaking havoc on otherwise managed schizophrenia due to acetylcholine disruption.

Everybody else on Facebook seems to be ignoring his behavior minus one or two people who occasionally drop a like on one of his less overtly disturbed posts, and I'm becoming more and more concerned for his wellbeing. However, I have absolutely no idea what to do, or if it's even my place to do anything. This is where you come in, Reddit.

What I need help with:

What should I do? Should I try to reach out to him? Should I try to reach out to his parents or other more recent friends? Are there any other subreddits I should cross-post this to? I had a roommate in college who I also witnessed descend into full blown schizophrenia with delusions of grandeur. As in, messianic delusions, claiming that I was to be his general and protector in the coming war with demons, which he learned about from interpreting song lyrics. Suggesting that he talk to a counselor was met with almost aggressive opposition, and I later learned that he had threatened to kill people regarding these delusions, which is what finally made the school intervene. So I'm reluctant to go into this half-cocked.

I should add that I am not a doctor, therapist, or other mental health professional, so I hope you can forgive me if I've misspoken on anything here. He's a good-hearted man and I just want to help him get help if I can, but am very much out of my element here. Thank you so much in advance for your responses.

TLDR: My friend, who I haven't seen in years, is exhibiting on Facebook the same unusual behavior he did years ago and everybody seems to be ignoring it. What do I do?",15Dec2018,1

When you first start psych meds, you honestly don’t know what you’re doing. I wish that there was a class on how to be a good and helpful patient that anyone could take for free when they get their first script, but instead, I will write out the things I believe are crucial in order to make significant progress aided by meds.

Patient Skills For a Lifetime

Although I am not a doctor or any sort of health professional, I do consider myself a “professional patient,” due to the past 13 years of dealing with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. All that time, I have been in treatment with psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, general practitioners, and specialists in various fields. The following is what I’ve learned.

1. One medication does not work the same on everyone. And if you’re already telling other people about your meds (what works for you and what doesn’t), then please read the disclaimer that needs to come before any advice you hand out.
2. Sometimes a med has the effect of causing health problems, making things worse, or affecting you in a way opposite of its intended purpose. An example is that for some people, some antidepressants can cause suicidal ideation, and some antipsychotics can cause hallucinations. These effects happen to a small minority of people, so this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try them. Because…
3. A med can save your life. A med can bring you back from the brink. A med can improve you enough to be able to use coping skills, which is difficult in a nonfunctional place.
4. Doctors are stabbing in the dark when you begin treatment. This means that you will probably have to try more than one medication before you find one that works. Once you find one that works, then you will need to… [Continue Reading](https://goldfishpainter.com/a-beginners-guide-to-psychiatric-medicine/)",15Dec2018,1

10,"I will start off by saying that I'm a 19 year old female. I have technically been diagnosed with three things: major depression, an anxiety disorder, and bulimia nervosa. I was diagnosed 2-3 years ago. And although I was mostly honest with the doctors, I can't say I was 100% honest. Because I was afraid that they'd think I was a bad person if I told them everything. I, myself, am afraid I'm a bad person. I really hope I'm not actually a narcissist, but I'm so worried that I am.



I made a long post about this that I accidentally deleted before it posted, but it was kind of all over the place. So this time I will try to make a more organized list of reasons that I am afraid I'm a narcissist.



1. I have extreme jealousy issues.


2. I tend to lack empathy and the ability to understand how other people are feeling. But I don't always lack empathy. Even though I can have problems with empathy sometimes, I always feel extreme guilt. To the point where any little ""rude"" thing I said or did haunts me. That might be because I can't stand it when someone hates me. However, I often feel like everyone hates me.


3. I feel like everyone is always staring at me. But only to judge me and be disgusted at every flaw. To compare themselves to me because obviously they are prettier and better.


4. I constantly look into mirrors. But this is because I always feel like I look horrible and I want to make sure I don't look awful all the time. I don't want more reasons for people to judge me.


5. Everybody leaves me eventually. Sometimes I try to convince myself that it's them, not me. But everyone leaving can't be a coincidence.. right?



5. I feel like sometimes I can be manipulative, but not on purpose. I have no interest in hurting others. All I ever wanted was to be loved and accepted honestly. I have threatened to commit suicide when someone left before. But I actually did want to commit suicide. And tried once or twice before. I feel like when someone leaves, my life is over. When I make a new friend or start liking a guy, it feels like I finally have a purpose. When they leave, it feels like I am the same empty shell of nothingness that I was before. So I tend to avoid friendships and relationships now. I know how I get, and I know I'll just end up disappointed and lonely again.



6. I sometimes feel like I'm ""faking"" who I am. But, again, not on purpose. I just don't really know who I am. I don't feel like anybody so when people tell me to ""just be myself,"" I don't know what that means. I act differently around different people. And I sometimes act like whatever I think is ""cool"" at the moment. But my interests and obsessions change somewhat frequently and, therefore, so do my personalities. I kind of feel like I put on masks and underneath those masks is a hollow shell that is nobody.



6. I tend to complain about every little thing. And sometimes everyone and everything just gets on my nerves.



7. I find myself pointing fingers often because I am afraid that if I apologize or admit I did something wrong, people will hate me and think I'm an evil person. I am trying to work on this though.



8. I have an oversharing problem. I sometimes tell people a bunch of stuff about me that no one needs to know. And I get embarrassed and ashamed about it later on. I have deleted so many posts and even a social media account because of my oversharing problem.



9. I take every little thing the wrong way. If someone said I looked ""okay,"" I would think they actually meant I looked fat, disgusting, and shouldn't show myself in public again. 



10. I can't handle the slightest bit of criticism, and I am very sensitive about everything. If someone said something mean about someone else that I was insecure about, I would assume they were actually secretly talking about me.



11. I feel like everyone is out to get me and wants to make my life worse. I feel like everyone is happy when I fail.



12. My emotions are very unstable. My relationships have very good times and very rough times because of this. Everyone gets tired of it after a while.



13. Sometimes when people are angry at me, I'm not exactly sure what I did wrong. 



14. Sometimes I kind of get obsessed with people and idolize them. Either in the form of jealousy (looking at the Instagrams of girls who are prettier and better than me to make myself envious, insecure, and sad) or love (thinking my new friend or boyfriend is perfect and wonderful, and wondering what the hell I'll ever do when they leave someday).



15. Sometimes I feel like everyone is rude and judgemental, and I want nothing to do with anyone because they're all mean. And other times, I feel like I'm a worthless, awful person and that everyone else is perfect and flawless.




16. I can be very impulsive, and sometimes I have a hard time controlling what I say to the people I love when I'm upset. This makes me believe I am mean.




17. I am very insecure and have low self-esteem. I know that this might conflict with NPD because they seem to be full of themselves. But I also heard that people with NPD secretly are very insecure people.




Again, I hope I am not a narcissist. But I share some traits with them so I am afraid I might be. I really hope I'm not as awful as I think I am. But the truth is that I'm probably even worse.",15Dec2018,1

13,"TL;DR: I suffer from borderline personality disorder and I cant control my emotions. I'm making myself physically sick worrying about a possible confrontation with my mother in law. 

To give you some backstory, my mother in law is a poisonous woman. She's always in a bad mood and judges everyone. Any time my husband, her son, achieves something she finds a way to put him down. She hates me because I stick up for him. The other day I stayed home from work sick and she had a fit because she was convinced I lost my job and we were lying to her.

Yestersay she lent him $80 because we're currently struggling financially, with the understanding we would pay it back asap. This $80 was because he was supposed to have his wisdom teeth removed. The dentist decided to refer him to an oral surgeon o8t of concern that if they removed them, they'd cause permanent nerve damage. When we told his mom this, she expected the money back which we understood, that was fine.

We didn't see her yesterday, but we are dropping our kids off tomorrow for them to watch for a couple hours. She said it would be fine to wait until then, so everything was squared away.

My husband texted me a couple hours ago to tell me he lost the money. He thinks it fell out when he pulled his keys out of his pocket, and he has retraced his steps to look for it, but cant find it.

Obviously this situation completely sucks. We still plan on paying the $80 back on payday, but when we tell her tomorrow she is probably going to get upset and accuse us of lying and spending the money on something else.

I struggle from BPD, so I literally cannot control my emotions. I am sitting here at work, worrying myself to the point of being physically ill about the drama it's going to cause.

I guess I'm just looking for some tips for this not to affect me or at least to help me cope with it.",15Dec2018,1

15,"Stuttering is a speech problem that is quite common in children and can continue into adulthood. It is estimated that around 1 in 20 children will struggle with stuttering at some point. Around 4 in 5 of those affected will grow out of it and it’s estimated that one in 100 adults will continue to stutter.

Stuttering is a physical condition, and if you are worried about having a stutter you should speak to your physician in the first instance. He or she can refer you to a speech therapist if necessary, who can advise on different therapies to alleviate the stutter.

Some evidence suggests that hypnotherapy has been found to decrease ones stutter. However the results are anything but conclusive. 

Hypnotherapy can help train the mind to not trip over the most common words that cause you to stutter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIkF9SKxksM

If you decide that you would like to seek the help of a hypnotherapist for your stutter, phone to have a talk with them first. Find out if they have experience of working with stutterers, if stutter therapy is one of their specialisms, and generally make sure that you are satisfied with their approach. ",15Dec2018,1

22,"Hello, Reddit. I am currently sitting at the lowest point I have ever been in my life. I am completely lost. After finding a good group on discord and chatting with one of its members, I was convinced to post this here. This will be long, so please bear with me; I'm asking for help. 

When I was 15, I was having a sexual relationship with a female who was 16. One day, we did something sexual at school, before the day started. She told her best friend about it, who in turn told the girl's boyfriend. After being confronted by her boyfriend, instead of owning up, she decided to say I forced myself on her. 

That day, I was taken into an office at school and forced to sign a paper waiving my rights before being interrogated by them. At first I lied and said I never touched her. I was in JROTC, had a pending scholarship to the Citadel, and didn't want to get kicked out of school. Well, I was offered to come and take a polygraph. So I did. Young and dumb me thought I could beat it. When asked, ""did you penetrate (name)"", I said no and failed. That was the only sexual question asked after the control questions. That was enough to have me charged with rape. 

Then, it went viral. I was in the newspaper, on the news, etc. My name and face. I was sent to a JDF and was bailed out by a friend. My mom was not around, she had taken off after being with my crackhead stepfather was too much for her and left me with him. He went to jail, and my father was homeless after getting out of jail recently at that time. So, public defender for me. 

I stayed at my friend's on and off, but was mostly on the streets. 2 years later, I came up on the docket. I was given 4 legal options. Plead guilty to a lesser charge and get probation, go through a YOA program, go to jury, or go to bench trial. I was told that the odds of winning the case were slim to none due to laws protecting victims at that time. YOA meant I would go to jail anyway, but be let out with an expunged record. I was an idiot and didn't want to go to jail at all. So, I took the plea deal and received 5 years suspended to 4 years of probation and 80h of community service

I was also required to take a test to determine if I would be required to register as a sex offender. So, I paid $400 to take an ABEL assessment. The result came back saying that I preferred underage females (high school females) and that meant I was likely to reoffend. I was 17, of course I liked females around my age. This upgraded my probation to intensive supervision and I was required to take a class twice a week at $35 per class and pay $100/m for intensive probation. The class was horrid. But I did learn in there that a lot of people really didn't do something wrong. Some did, but nowhere near the numbers you'd think. 

My house was flipped upside down weekly to see if I violated any rules, I had a curfew. Pretty much anything but working and sleeping was prohibited. The rules were harsh. I met my now ex-wife at 18. We clicked nicely and I fell in love. I told her about my background and she convinced her parents to let me move in. Well, we moved to another house down the road for cheap soon after. Then the relationship started degrading fast. I found out she had massive mental issues. Like massive. Bipolar, schitsophrenic, multiple personality disorder, and she self harmed. She had apparently stopped taking medication I didn't know about and her symptoms began to blossom into a hurricane of misery. 

She said she stopped taking them because she was pregnant. She was pregnant because she stopped her birth control without telling me. Keep in mind I am still young and very stupid at this point. Then she told me I had to marry her or get kicked out. Kicked out while on intensive supervision = back to jail + being charged with additional crimes. So I caved and married her. After the first child was born, things got alright. She was back on meds and settling down. I was doing my best to make her more stable for the benefit of my children and my freedom. She got pregnant again a couple of years later. Her birth control implant had failed. So, we moved to a more prosperous area, I was finally making above minimum wage. I completed my probation and things were up and down in the relationship for the entire 8 years that have passed. The relationship took an extremely poor about 6 months before being kicked out of my home, and I was keeping to myself after work mostly.  Then she finally broke. I came home one day from the gym to find a transexual (F to M), coming out of my daughter's bathroom wobbling around drunk. Then my wife stumbles out of the bedroom. What insued was a complete shit storm. After that was over, I was pretty much kicked out. I roomed up with someone I knew, and still am. 

I met someone new at work. Someone great. Someone I still love to this day. Someone that I'm forced to see after being dumped a week ago. 

My life has been one letdown after another. It never stops. Ever. From early childhood abuse, to being used and lied to by females constantly, to being the one bearing the weight of the world in my shoulders. I was a sole provider for my house for 8 years. She never lifted a finger. I get to see my children when she feels like it, and only then. She has an on and off boyfriend that's about as useful as a paperweight who is trying to replace me. 

I have lost my life. I have lost my purpose. My check is taken by child support and alimony. I can't afford help. I need mental help, I really do. I don't know where to go or what to do. Besides feeling constantly depressed, heartbroken, having anxiety attacks constantly, and having suicidal thoughts more and more often, I don't know what to do.

So, Reddit, what do I do?   ",15Dec2018,1
23,"So, tl;dr I've had depression (among other things) for basically 8 years, it's gotten so much worse in the last year and a half but I'm *very* close to getting better and just need help on how to function normally after that.

That might sound weird but I've been like this since I was near 10 years old (and had bad earlier years) so I never really learned how to ""format"" a day or week or whatever. It's always just been go to school when I can, get home, watch TV/use the computer and then sleep, and since April I can't even do the going to school part - in the last month for example I've only been outside twice (both times to have appointments about my mental health). I'm worried that even if I'm getting better I'm still gonna be stuck in this routine because I don't know how to fix it.

Also the school I've been at for the last few years are letting me come back whenever I can, which I'd guess would be February/March. The biggest problem is that because I failed last year due to my mental health, the 1 friend I did have at this school graduated and moved on and it's a new year/grade of people so I don't know anybody. I would find it hard enough to make friends at the beginning of a school year, but I think I'm gonna be completely lost in the middle of one, and I know I really won't be happy going through a year and a half of school by myself (I have a couple of people that I talk to but it's all social media and texting, I live with others but it's like flats with a shared kitchen so we don't really interact, and it just really wasn't fun in recent years to be in class or at lunch or in a break where that one friend was away and I was by myself).

Sorry this has gone on but basically I'm wondering:

* how do you make friends (tragic to ask I know), especially in the middle of a school year when people already know each other?
* is going outside everyday normal? And if so what do you do if it's not to go to work/school?
* if you get home from school or work or whatever is it typical to go outside in the same day again?
* generally what does an average healthy day or week look like?
* and kind of bouncing off of that, what are some general suggestions to start living a more normal and less sedentary life? I'm thinking about maybe using my school's gym despite limitations on how often its available, and right now I do a little bit of music and art. Cheers",15Dec2018,1

28,"I am a male, 19. I've had panic attacks since 12 and anxiety for as long as I remember. I was in CBT for a year between 17 and 18. I made this list of symptoms I've noticed, most of them I've had throughout my teens. Idk what sort of response I want but I wrote it all out so might as well post it

*Anxiety (diagnosed GAD) 
*Panic attacks - actually have had only one or two past six months after one year of therapy which ended this summer. I used to have them weekly
*Depression

Symptoms I didn't tell my therapist about:
*Obsessive periods (can last a day to a few weeks - end abruptly, usually with anxiety or ""falling into"" depression, usually about religons, ideologies, historical periods or fashion/music styles)
*Mood swings - can go from top to bottom in less than a day 
*Euphoria 
*Hypochondria - recently went to the doctor b/c I thought I had a heart problem, they found nothing wrong. I enjoy washing my hands (not in an OCD way tho)
*Irritability - lashing out at brother, mostly 
*Severe social anxiety - mostly with strangers (like I'll avoid going to the barber shop, eventually force myself to do it)
*Time/memory weirdness (?) It feels like time moves very fast but I have a hard time remembering my days and when I think back more than a week it feels like very long ago
*""Emotional self-harm"" - sometimes I'll intentionally seek out things, mostly online, I know will trigger my anxiety. I've also hit/pinched w nails myself a few times but not alot.
*Fascination with suicide - I have a fondness for art, music and movies depicting suicide. I also enjoy reading about how for example ancient romans and japanese saw suicide as virtuous. I also enjoy jokes about suicide.
*Recently questioning gender/sexuality, but not sure if just obsessive period. About a month ago became obsessed with a certain trans youtuber, watched her videos alot for ca 3 weeks. Ended with me watching a bunch of transphobic content and having a panic attack. Now think I might be bi, went on a tinder date w guy (didn't go too well). Watched gay movies/shows.
During the past few weeks I've also been discovering so much new music, I think I made a playlist with over 200 songs or so. I've actually felt really good, like I'm reinventing myself and like I'm coming out of a depression. I'm going to be the bi guy who likes this new hiphop and has some nice boyfriend. This morning I went up and tried making my own pickles, dancing around in the kitchen, watching naruto like I used to when I was a happy 10 year old. But now the same day I feel like shit, lying awake writing this thinking about making myself throw up so I can pretend to be sick tomorrow. Lol

29,"Hello all,

I wrote  a post a week or so ago about my wife and trying to deal with her emotional break downs. This is kind of a update but not really.

Anyway, the day after I posted wife came home from work and informed me she quit her job as a convenience store manager and was not going back. I am on disability and cant work. I pay the household bills with my disability. we depend on her income for food and whatever else, like the $400 dollar car payment on car she just bought two months ago.  So now we wont be able to buy food or pay car payment after Christmas. The only way we can do so is for my 20 yr old daughter that lives with us to take care of those things.

My daughter for the last two months has been waking up with attitude out of this world, and biting my head off if I speak to her.

I have always had a good grasp on things. My wife has done this kind of thing before, I can think of five times she has had issues like this and quit good jobs. Time before this was a longtime ago but caused us to separate for a longtime.

we have been married 22 yrs. I am at end of my rope. If I say anything to wife about this. I am not supporting her she says. I don't want to push her over the edge, but I am fed up with all of the BS. I cant deal with people viewing me as bad guy. Tired of being the punching bag for anyone that is having a bad day, or bad day at work, or did not sleep good or the hell ever. I just don't know what way to turn. But I know I can not continue this way.",15Dec2018,1
30,"Does anybody have this crazy anxiety about the evil that goes on in this world? You’ll see YouTube videos about people talking about the horrors they find on the Dark Web, or even actual gore videos of people doing these horrible acts to others. The fact that evil people exist that want/have no problem killing another innocent life makes my emotions and chemicals in my brain run wild and I have to sit down. It feels suffocating. I can’t do anything about it.. nor would I want to even be within 10 miles of someone with those traits. Oh wait!! I’ll never know if I’m even 2 FEET from someone at the store that is a killer.  I watched a video about these people interviewing a cartel hitman and it scared me so badly I had to pull my mom aside and talk to her about it. The good thing is, she said she can relate completely (I mean, being a mom and all you have probably 10 senses compared to anyone who isn’t one) (shoutout every loving mother out there including mine)

This all happened after a drug/lack of sleep whatever you want to call it-induced psychotic break. I hallucinated/had beliefs that my friends wanted to kill me (even though they love me to death) I hallucinated people outside my window with guns that wanted to kill me and my family.. just.. terrible things. I am clean now and don’t want to even think about going back to my bad habits. 

I get this overwhelming feeling of dread, hopelessness, sadness for the world, and fear all in one. It’s a horrible feeling and it’s even worse that there are people out there who do these things without remorse. The only good that I see from this at least is it makes me continue to want to love and only spread Love and continue to be a better person for myself. But the Fear outweighs that here by tons",15Dec2018,1
31,"I just wish I had an answer. I feel like a huge burden to everyone. I’ve been insanely emotional as of lately, which has been frustrating my boyfriend. It’s been frustrating me too. I know he has the right to be annoyed, but every time he gets angry at me, my brain flashes back to all the other times he’s been angry at me and I completely break down because I never want to disappoint him. My memories are strongly linked to my feelings. If I remember a certain feeling in the past, I relive it and it scares me a lot of the times. I don’t know how to stop it. It’s not something I do intentionally. I have so much trouble separating my current feelings from things I felt in the past. I was trying to lighten the mood by saying “well, you knew I was a big dummy and you still chose me.” I was trying to get him to laugh, because I didn’t want him stressing and he told me that I wasn’t like this when we had met. I couldn’t help but feel like I’ve completely disappointed him after hearing that, because I know I wasn’t. I can’t help but feel as if how I’ve changed is unfair to him. He asked me to be more jealous, etc. I wasn’t at first because I honestly think I was subconsciously trying to protect him from that. Now I wish I hadn’t done that. I trust him completely, so that’s not the issue. I just feel like my emotions are too extreme and I feel like such a fucking waste of space for it. Every time I try to express my feelings, I end up hating myself in the end. I just want to make him happy and I want to be happy too. Anyways, after a traumatic event happened, we were constantly with each other. Soon, the love of my life became my life. Not that I’m complaining, I’m so happy about that. I wouldn’t have it any other way. I just feel as if I don’t know what I’m interested in anymore... he told me that he wishes I’d initiate more interesting conversations as I used to with my friends. Well, I don’t really have any friends anymore so, I forgot what that’s like. I know my conversations with them were just all silly though. He knows what he loves—science. He’s so passionate about the cosmos, etc. But... when it comes to me... all I really have is him and he gets frustrated with me about that. I used to be passionate about psychology, but I never really talk about it anymore. I’ve changed drastically this past year. Things that I know would make me happy... they’re not things that’ll expand my mind and I feel this pressure to catch up with the rest of this world. I hate myself for enjoying things that aren’t productive. I feel so stupid. I wish I were smarter and I wish I were more reasonable. I wish I could study and read when I’m upset but I can’t think of anything when I am. I don’t know if I should embrace my dumb hobbies. I don’t even know if they’ll really fix anything. I just feel like I need to change. I constantly feel like I need to grow up, suck it up, start focusing more on becoming more knowledgeable about things... if I don’t do those things... I’m afraid I’ll become more of a disappointment than I already am. I’m not my own person anymore. I just feel like a tumor in everyone’s lives. I love my mom to pieces... I’d never wish this on her... but I was supposed to be a miscarriage and I can’t help but feel as if it’d be better if I didn’t survive. I don’t know how to find myself, I really don’t. I feel so pressured to change but I don’t even who I am right now. If I break myself down and try building myself back up... i might be just as lost and that’d be hell for my boyfriend. I love him so much and I’d never want to be apart from him, but he might’ve been way better off not meeting me. Honestly... I just needed to get all of this out. I’m so damn confused and so depressed and I can’t tell anyone else without feeling like I’m ruining their lives. I just want to get better so I’m not such a damn nuisance.

I believe that I have periods where I am hallucinating but it is delusional like there are people outside trying to break in or people outside vandalizing my stuff or people in my life plotting against me. 

I also deal with a kind of hyper-sexuality which I won't go into here but rest assured it is not healthy. 

I have also been dealing with not hearing people correctly or I hear them but my brain translates it into something else or I hear them but I just can't understand them it's like their speaking a foreign language and I xan clearly hear the words but I simply cannot put together what their saying.

35,"Imagine you’re young. Someone with a huge heart. Smart. Some part of me just wants to write this story. It’s not happy, but it’s not sad. This is just to put life into perspective without going into much detail. This is just life. 

You meet a girl in high school. You fall in love. You live your life thinking that one person is your person forever. You both fall deeply for each other. You’re families are involved. Things are good. You go off to college in a different city. She stays here. You’re relationship grows stronger and luckily the city is close enough to take day trips during the weekend. You become more successful in college. Neglect to come home as often but the relationship is still as strong as you want it to be. You come home from winter break. Things seem weird because this is your old home. You’re a city boy now. You give her a ring for Christmas. You both are so in love that it seems right. School starts up again. A month later it’s February. A week before Valentine’s Day, she hands you back the ring and says she doesn’t love you anymore. You don’t understand and it leaves you very distraught, for a long time at that. You send her flowers for Valentine’s Day, she rejects them because she really doesn’t love you anymore. Time goes on and you guys get back together. She doesn’t love you anymore at all. You can feel it. She tells you this while you’re away in your other city after you find out she had relations with another guy. You find out when you move back she was talking to your best friend. The closest one to you. The one that helped you through the breakup. He stops talking to her and gives you his word. A year later, after apologizing for hurting you so bad and trying not to be spiteful, she starts dating your best friend. And it kills you but you realize through this what life is really about. 

This is the worst depression I’ve ever had, and this is real. 

There is a point in life where you grow up. 

Despite all the hurt that you have been through, you have made and set goals for yourself throughout the time of your depression. You had your own art show. Nobody can take that from you. You made your financial goal by your age. Nobody can take that from you. You made your education goal. Nobody can take that from you. And finally, you made a career for yourself that you have always dreamt of since you were small. 

You grow out of this depression. You find things that brighten up your life and benefit you to the point where there is no possible way of going back to this person. If there was any chance, you would not be doing the things you do right now. You realize you don’t have time for lower level people like that. You are on a great path and never sold out. The plan stays the same and you need to make people know this. 

Mental health plays the greatest role in this entirely. Perseverance. Emotions are temporary. Feelings are what make you as a person. Your reactions to situations ultimately sculpt who YOU are. 

Be good to yourself. Be good to other people. Love yourself. You are you’re own #1. Never lose that. ",15Dec2018,1

37,"So, I just let go of the person I love of 3 years. It all went downhill after I’ve confessed some intrusive thoughts (OCD related perhaps) and it just took a toll on them. 

I don’t want to hurt them anymore. Even though I did not want to and it hurt so much, I had to let go. They’re probably conflicted because they also don’t know if they should hold on or just go and I feel the same. 

I want them to stay but I’ve been so in my head lately, my obsessive thoughts can get out of hand and if I don’t give in to telling them and “confessing” I just become really depressive. 

I feel a little lighter I did them right. They deserve better, more than the person this sickness made me become in a span of a week. 

However, they were my rock and my shoulder to lean on. My intrusive and obsessive thoughts were focused on them for the remaining week and I usually always confessed everything to them (hence that all backfired and put them through so much stress that we just broke) 

My concern is, even after we are over, what happens if I get another obsessive thought or intrusive thought about them? Of course I’m gonna get the compulsion or urge to “confess” because it feels like, even if we aren’t together anymore, I still did them wrong. Like stained their memory. 

I don’t want that. I want them to remain as how lovely as I remember them. Plus, I might feel restless without telling them and I just dont want to be the ex that keeps venting intrusive thoughts and further stain their memory of me.

38,"Mentions of suicidal ideation and plans etc.

Long story short, I was an inpatient for almost 2 years in an open adolescent ward until I turned 18 and moved to mental health specific supported housing. And during my childhood, my sister had severe mental health issues and would start crying and screaming at my parents out of the blue and I'd have to go to my room and look after myself and my parents emotionally neglected me throughout my childhood. (My other mental health stuff is kind of unrelated to this post)

I've spent a lot of time talking about mental health issues and I've been in regular therapy for 2 and a half years so I'm used to talking about it and I'm generally a very open person (sometimes weirdly open) but for some reason I haven't been able to be honest at all this week about how I'm feeling/what's going on for me.

On Tuesday, I felt this intense sadness most of the day and then started hallucinating that someone else in the house was having a breakdown except everything she did was mirroring how my sister did it when I was little and while I was hallucinating I felt like I was a little kid again (my sister is older than me and I was 5-8 when she got worse/before she moved out) and I forgot how scary it felt to be in that position.

Then after that I became more suicidal and on Thursday I was at a meeting with my case manager and keyworker (from the supported housing, it was a meeting about attending college and pretty uneventful). During the meeting I got super sad seemingly out of nowhere. I get mood swings normally thanks to BPD but they're usually between depression, mania, and extreme anger/irritation and I don't get mood swings that go to sad. And just after the meeting I was kind of quiet and my case manager thought she'd annoyed me and thought I was just pissed off and I was like ""seriously, you didn't do anything"" while wanting to just collapse in the street and start sobbing (I still don't know why) and then after that they thought my mood picked up when really I just started thinking more and more about suicide and it calmed me down a lot.

After I got back I started thinking about how I was going to kill myself and started writing a letter to my case manager, it wasn't really directed at her I just needed to address it to someone. I don't think I could actually go through with a plan without writing a note as I didn't want her or anyone else to think it had been their fault as I'm pretty sure she would've otherwise. Midway through writing I stopped and I was spacing in and out and then got hit with a wave of catatonic depression (I get it for like a few hours at a time and then it'll pass) and by the time I was able/wanted to move I wasn't as suicidal and just put the letter in a draw and went on with my day.

Usually if I've spoken to someone and anything came up I'd tell them about it (like people who work at the house). Like over the course of being in hospital and I came very close to succeeding in killing myself more times than I remember and through all of that I could talk about it but for some reason I haven't been able to tell anyone anything this week and I don't know why.

I'm a British 15 year old boy struggling a lot with mood swings at the moment, but every time I try to talk to anyone about it, they just blame it on hormones, including my local doctor (he took a blood test for anaemia and then when it came back negative he said that it was ""an emotional issue"" and then proceeded to do nothing about it).

I understand that during teenage years puberty makes your body into a hormonal mess, but I still worry because no-one else my age has mood swings on my level. For example, one minute I'll be visibly shivering with fear and then the next I'll be throwing a chair at someone and then I'll be making jokes and etc. I've even had a nervous breakdown because of this...

Is it possible that I'm just more emotional than others, or is this something I should be more concerned about? If I should seek help, does anyone have any recommendations? It's a lot to ask, but I'd be really thankful for whatever advice you have!

I'm 25M hes 21M. we met at the gym. we are not gym buddies but sometimes we are there same time so we talk. weve been friends for 4 months now. we've always been nice to each other

However, one thing  I've noticed are his mood swings. something I've noticed since ive seen him in the gym (before we started talking). On some days he is in a good mood and is sociable but on some days, hes cold and wont reply much. This november, the latter has been more frequent. Id get scanty replies be it through text or face to face, and I dont think anyone would like that. Id ask if hes ok and hed say the generic response ""Im fine""

He has never shown any signs that he does not like me. as a matter of fact, its the opposite (as a friend).

*  If we havent seen each other in a week and then we do, hed say something like ""its good to see you i havent seen you in a while.'
*  On some occasion he seems happy to see me and looks upset when i leave. He also shows moderate forms of affection (see below)
* We went from fist bumps to handshakes to those brohug handshakes (which he was the first to start doing). Mid november on one occasion, he pat me on the waist when he said goodbye to me. That might seem like a small matter...but its a bit 'romantic' for a dude to do that to another - although im not bothered by it. And definitely you wont do that to someone you dont like

From mid november onwards he has been a bit cold and his bad days were more frequent. hed  reply me with one word up front and gets annoyed when i try talking to him. at one point he even snapped when i asked a question.

I confronted him through text that eventhough i apologized for the question, i shouldve recieved one for being snapped at. and since he has no interest in talking to me lately, i wont be talking to him. i got no response.

A week+ later I realize everyone makes mistakes and have bad days, and I shouldnt retaliate at the first mistake especially since he has been nice to me in the past. i send an apology for retaliating (eventhough i deserve one) because i dont want to make things worse for him. still no response.

Eventually I meet him at the gym and we do that brohug thing...as if weve moved forward. I ask to talk to him after hes done working out and he said ok. He didnt. He went straight home and sent me a text saying he doesnt want to talk and goes to the gym just to workout and only that (not to talk).

Seeing how we might not talk anymore, i told him how i felt. How Ive always felt like hes going through something because i noticed the mood swings. told him he can still talk to me if he needs someone to talk to, and if he doesnt want to talk to me, talk to someone, because bottling things are bad.

No response also. We havent blocked each other. and at no point have we attacked each other personally. Im a bit worried about his wellbeing and quite upset that I may have lost a friend. My fear is that stress and anxiety (atleast) are getting to him

He has mentioned his family has it difficult sometimes because they have so much things to pay (insurances, their schooling and etc) and i think he might be struggling. He has also just finished college (which he said is difficult to pay for). 2 weeks after finishing college and hes already frustrated about having to find work (he seems to really need it).

I dont know if that is enough to assume someone is having a hard time. finances are a big thing. can these (and perhaps some other stuff) be affecting his behaviour? I am worried...although we may never speak to each other again.",15Dec2018,1

50,"So this is a doozy. My (28F) husband (36M), has recently been experiencing extreme chronic back pain. He has had what I can only categorize as a nervous breakdown, I believe in response to this extreme, unrelenting pain. We have four children (blended family), home school, and work together at a start up, so we have a pretty busy and stressful life. Because of these factors, we also spend A LOT of time together, meaning I have taken on the brunt of the situation that has occurred without a break for my own mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

In the interest of keeping this brief, I won't go all into the details. The short version is that he has been paranoid, hostile, assuming the worst of every situation, yelling at me and others, cussing at me, ranting for hours at a time without waiting for feedback, hitting the floor or other furniture when people disagree with him, and making detailed, violent comments. This is NOT like him at all. Though he has a tendency to ramble and think he knows best (we suspect he may have Asperger's), the level of hostility and mania is completely new. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I work together at a company he started with another couple. Most of the employees are friends that we've worked with at one point or another, so we're all close and have good intentions. Last week, husband's actions had gotten so extreme that *everyone* in our small company (7 not included me and him) started coming up to me, asking if he was okay, encouraging me to get him help, and asking about the wellbeing of me and my children. To be honest, after several days of him ranting, yelling, hitting furniture, and keeping me awake for hours on end, I was NOT in a good place. I was having panic attacks, crying at the drop of a hat, wanting to self harm, and feeling frightened to see or talk to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part of all this is that we had planned on leaving for a vacation as a christmas present to our children just a few days after his behavior completely changed. After talking to others at work, I finally confronted him to say that I couldn't go on vacation with him acting like this. I told him people were worried for his and my wellbeing. I will admit that I was emotional after nearly two weeks of being berated and walking on egg shells. I left the house with my kids and stayed with my mom. He left the house and went to see family. 

&amp;#x200B;

The following day, I tried to talk to him with his dad to convince him to come to the ER and have them evaluate his pain and mental health. He refused (with much hostility). He told me he had found a therapist and would contact them himself the following week. I told him that I was going to go ahead and take the kids on vacation to give him time to address his mental health his way, without us around as triggers. We both needed time apart. However, not even 48 hours after I left, his family had him committed for a 96 hour hold. I've talked to him a few times since then. He sounds better, but he is refusing the medication they've recommended (Ambilify). 

&amp;#x200B;

He is completely livid at his family for having him committed. He never wants to speak to them again and claims he has a legal case against them and the hospital. I know he is not in his right mind, but since he's refusing to take the meds, I'm afraid by the time he gets out and I get home from our vacation, he will still be in the same angry, hostile state. I know that I cannot continue to be around him with that behavior, and our children certainly can't be exposed to it. I don't know how to explain to him that literally everyone in our life, all his friends and family, could see he needed help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love this man so much. We have a great life together when he is well and I don't want to abandon him during this time of need. But I have to protect myself and my kids, our mental health, and the well-being of our company and friends. I don't know how to navigate the conversation that 1) everyone agrees he needed help in some form and 2) regardless of if being committed helped, his behavior towards us has not been okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My husband had a nervous breakdown, I believe due to the chronic pain he has been in. His family had him committed and he is saying he never wants to speak to or see them again. However, ALL his friends and family, myself included, think he needed to be there. How do I discuss this with him safely and respectfully?",15Dec2018,1
51,"My husband is a home-daily OTR truck driver. His regular truck was in the shop earlier this week, and he got it back on Thursday, when it malfunctioned again, Thursday evening on his way back to the shop. This involved a red idiot light on the dash telling him to shut the engine off, along with a loud piercing alarm, roughly once per second. So he pulls over to the side of the road, shuts off the truck and calls his dispatch.

Dispatch puts him through to a mechanic, who takes this info from my husband and then tells him to go ahead and drive it back. He asks the mechanic if there's any way to disable the alarm, and is told there isn't, so he asks if it will shut off at some point, and the mechanic (who is clearly guessing) says in about a half hour.

It was **two-and-a-half-hours** to get back to the shop, and the alarm shrieks the entire time. My husband has no earbuds or any other way to block out the noise, so he resorts to moist paper towels to try and dampen the sound down, which helped only barely. By the time he got back to the shop, he was so rattled that he had started crying and didn't realize he was doing it. He calculated that he listened to that shriek 9000 times in that 2 1/2 hour period.

When he got home, he was practically catatonic, was speaking noticeably slowly and just had a stunned look on his face. We have some quality whiskey in the house which mostly goes untouched, but on this occasion he prepared a large-ish glass, which he drank while he told me what happened. He got up Friday morning having hardly slept the night before. Had I known the state he was in, I would have insisted he call in sick, but he drove to work a a minimum speed limit, and had to pull over several times as the shakes and ugly crying spells took him over. I called him later that morning and he said he had told dispatch that he was taking a single run today, as he was in no shape to be on the road. He sounded subdued, emotionally wrung, and again said he had been crying sporadically and just wanted to go home. He also noted that there is a very strong undercurrent of extreme anger, but at the same time he just wants to curl up in a ball and lie down.

He got home only slightly earlier than usual last evening, and after I got him fed, I had him take 3 trazodone that I have on hand to give my dogs when thunderstorms are in the area. He seems to be a little more himself this morning, but I'm more than moderately concerned that this might be longer lasting, and whether I should get him in to see somebody. I tried joking with him a little last night saying that I've always been the one with mental problems in this house and there's no room for another, which got me a sigh at least. 

Psychology has always been a favorite topic of mine, and while part of me is clinically (coldly) fascinated, it is also horrible to see it happen to someone you love dearly. I've read accounts on the methods of psychological torture in books and elsewhere, and trying to come to grips with the idea that things like this are done *intentionally* to human beings for days, weeks, months on end. Having now seen it done *accidentally*; what kind of monstrous mental trauma do these prisoners have to deal with, when what my husband endured seemed like such a 'small dose' that resulted in such a reaction? He's not sure if he can go back to work next week. If it lasts, obviously we'll be seeking professional help, but some discussion and/or real-world comparative stories would help a bit, I think.

This ended up longer than I anticipated. Thank you for your patience and for reading all the way through.",15Dec2018,1
53,"I seems I can so easily ""talk"" to people when I'm planning it out in my head, but then when it comes to actually talking to them, if I can get past even just asking them if we can talk, (a lot harder for me than you think) all I can say is ""idk, I'm fine"" when I'm obviously not. I just don't know how to go about opening up. I just feel like no one cares or no one wants to deal with what's going on inside my head. I feel like I always have os much going on, and I don't know how to control it, so I end up just not thinking  during the day.

54,"Hello! So basically, I'm aware my mental health is pretty fucked up but I have no idea what exactly I have. I know I have social anxiety, although it's been better. I cringe for daaaays after every conversation I have though. It does make me avoid and dread every social situation, although once I'm in it it's ok. I have maladaptive daydreaming, basically every thought is a daydream, an interview, a fake conversation with someone else, a narrative of my life. Madeup stories, madeup people. I don't live in the real world in my mind. My mood is completely terrible. One day I am soooo happy, I'm positive and everything is wonderful and there is so much hope. And then the next day I cannot smile at anything and I am completely silent and can't even look anyone in the eye. And for about 4 years I basically know I'll kill myself when I'm older, it's weird. I never think of myself dying any other way, just one day I won't be able to handle all this shit and I'll go completely crazy and kill myself. Also, magic thinking. I will say phrases in my head to keep things from happening and there is synchronicity EVERYWHERE. And I cannot advance in life no matter how I try. Fuck, I don't even try, I don't know what to do??? Idk, I just feel so crazy lately and stuck and my mind keeps me there. Sometimes I think killing myself would make my life and everyone else's life easier, but I wouldn't because I have a sister and I'm the only person she has. So I obsess over my art and all I do is sit in my room and paint and dream of it taking me somewhere even tho I can't get myself to take any steps to do it. I know most of it's my fault, but it all feels like a result of my mental health. Thanks for reading this if you did, idek what I expect people to respond. I'll have to be literally dragged to a doctor because I'm also so unhealthy it's insane. I look so unhealthy, my skin is dull, I'm weak as fuck, I'm always tired, I can't concentrate easily at all. I go 2 weeks eating close to nothing because of anxiety and then 2 weeks binging on shit food. I know I'm malnourished and underweight, and it's so embarrassing and eating is so hard. Everything is so. Fucking. Hard. fuck. I still have hope I'll be better one day, but I feel like deep inside I tell myself but I know I'm just gonna be stuck in this loop for eternity. what is it like going to a doctor for mental health? I'm convinced I'll go and she'll say my mental health is fine, or won't think maladaptive daydreaming is a serious issue. I'm afraid of medication because I have a huge phobia of throwing up and that's all of their side effects. Plus when I can't eat, I can't take a pill, so then what? Oh yea, I also over worry about everything. That's my giant wall of text, I think already ended it somewhere up there, but i don't know. The brain is wild. ",15Dec2018,1

All we can do for you is to listen and respond. We can offer our support through words and remind you that you are not alone. We will be here in the middle of the night. We will hear you, and we will try to help.

Move forward with the hope of treatment and remission. You need to be seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. Depression is hard, and you may not have much energy or functionality today. That’s okay. Make your one task for the day “Make an appointment with a psychiatrist”, and even if there is a long waiting list, set the appointment and put it on your calendar so that you will have help in the future. Do the same thing tomorrow, only with a therapist.

If you already have a psychiatrist and therapist, stay vigilant in keeping your appointments and taking your medicine. Start to build your toolbox of [coping strategies](https://goldfishpainter.com/coping-tools-you-can-borrow/),(that link is to a list of all of my coping tools) and use it when you’re in pain, even if that means you are using it all day, every day. You cannot be cured, but your pain can be managed. For your next appointment, take any notes you can on your symptoms, triggers, medicine effects/side-effects, sleep problems, eating problems, and daily moods. There is no wrong way to take these notes, just write down information every couple of days about things you experience in your illness. The important thing is that you ...

I’ve started and quit 3 jobs from the middle of November to now. I feel absolutely worthless. When I wake up in the mornings I cry heavily. My mind is on a hamster wheel. I’m losing so much sleep. I’ve been ignoring all of these problems because I’ve had a safety net my whole life, but now that I’m old, pay my own bills ect. it has really become a struggle. I’m currently taking Zoloft (50 mg) &amp; atarax (50 mg) though I don’t really like the atarax. It makes me feel too dizzy. I don’t have many interests. I was at a job for a year and a half where I was belittled, horribly. I was always on time to work and busted my butt, but never appreciated. I quit a little over a month ago by storming out and cursing at my now former boss. I bathed dogs. Those dogs that informed close bonds to are no longer in my life so now I feel completely alone, even though I’m not. I have the best woman in the world by my side. But why am I not motivated enough to go out and be successful? I want to be able to give her all of these things but I feel like it’s impossible to reach. Please help me reddit family. ",15Dec2018,1
69,"So I’m 17 in college (England), and I think it’s because of social anxiety, but whenever I’m around people that I don’t know very well (or sometimes around people I know) and they ask me questions I immediately turn bright red in the face and it is so frustrating because it stops me from doing so many things like getting a job or going to university because I am scared that I will turn red in front of the interviewer and things like that. I honestly do not know why this happens and if I’m the only one because I have never met someone as socially anxious and scared as myself. Even with my parents, if they ask me a question where it feels as though I’m being confronted about something, I turn red in the face. It makes it so hard this time of the year to have a good time because around family when they ask me ‘how’s school going?’ I turn red and it’s so annoying and I really wish I could have conversations like a regular person.

It was full of silences and mumbles and I didn’t know how to say goodbye, so I kind of just walked away after saying “see ya later” even though she want done with the conversation. This is only an example of embarrassing moments I’ve had, and no matter how long ago it was, I still end up randomly thinking about it.

71,"A little backstory...

My boyfriend is a Marine combat vet who suffers from PTSD and depression.

This past Friday (a little over a week ago) was the anniversary for one of his best friends dying overseas, and he fell into a deep depression. I was supposed to go over to his place after work, but I get a text from his friend saying he drank too much, backed himself into a dark hole, and had reached out for help. His friend was going to bring him to his house to recover for the night.

The next day, I hear from my boyfriend. He is still very depressed, and his friends and family are concerned, although he is adamant that he will be okay and does NOT want to go in to be checked out (he's got a thing with being locked up

&amp; having his freedom taken away). This is the last time I heard from him (last Saturday, a week ago today).

Lat weekend comes and goes, and his phone remains unanswered. I start to panic. He's never left me in the dark before. Is he just dealing with his demons and needs to some to process? Is he in the hospital? Has he harmed himself? Finally, I get a text from his friend Sunday night saying that he has indeed been admitted to the psych ward, under court order. However, no one knows which one he's at exactly, because he was so upset with his friends and family for having him admitted that he got himself transferred to an unknown hospital upon admission and took his dad off of his medical release records, so no one has any way to figure out where he is.

This past week has come and gone, and none of us has heard from him. His friend has had his phone since he was admitted Saturday, so it's not like he can get access to my phone number, but the more time that goes by, the more hurt I am... he knows where I work, for example. Maybe this is expecting too much.

I've called hospitals, but there are laws in place preventing them from releasing any information to me, so there's really nothing I can do. I text his friend again yesterday, and according to him, it's one of two things - either he's in bad enough shape that the 72-hour hold has been extended and he's still admitted at some hospital, or he's so angry with his friends and family for having him admitted that he's ""off-the-grid"".

I've accepted that there's nothing I can do at this point but wait and hope that I hear word of him at some point... I guess what I'm really wondering at this point is, at what point should I just cut my losses? I love him, I'm willing to wait by his side and be there for him through all of this, but for all he knows, I don't even know he was admitted in the first place. He's cut off contact from everyone in his life, and while I understand his hurt and anger, I can't fathom intentionally causing this much distress to the people who love you. For now, I'll continue waiting by the phone, and hoping that he's okay... I've been so worried and stressed that I'm having trouble getting on with my life and doing what I need to do. I'm just at a complete loss.",15Dec2018,1
72,"I know that losing interest in the things you used to enjoy before being depressed is normal and that this symptom is basically textbook depression. However, my depression makes me unable to distinguish between the things that I should still normally love (if i weren't depressed) and the things that I'm genuinely growing apart from. I'm super confused because there are things that I have no reasons to feel ""meh"" or indifferent about yet I still feel this way...I don't know how to explain, there's this gut feeling that's telling me something is perfectly enjoyable yet there's like an invisible barrier that's stopping me from enjoying it.

For example, at least once a day I might get really anxious, have intense intrusive thoughts, be unable to eat for a while, or something else like that.

75,"I've struggled with depression since been a teen, up until now (i'm 27) I'd never been properly diagnosed or given any medication, but the spiraling, deep, hopeless feelings of despair are back, and worse than ever.  


I can't cope anymore.   


I am only living because I know what my death would do to my partner, I honestly think i'd have ended my life if it wasn't for that. But now i'm even starting to stop caring about that and coming to a realisation that i'm so hopeless and clueless of what to do with myself, I have nowhere to turn at all  


I tried to talk to my parents about it, they sat in silence, basically told me how shit my job is (as that was one thing i'd mentioned briefly) and then I left and went home... that was a couple of months ago and i've not seen them since  


I tried to talk to my (now few) friends about it. They don't know what to say. Some of them have a lot of issues and bigger stresses in their own lives so I don't blame them.  


I tried to talk to my local GP, she didn't really seem too concerned, despite me breaking down, crying and explaining how hopeless I felt - she gave me an A4 sheet of paper with a number to ring. I didn't  


I've tried to talk to my girlfriend many times, but she doesn't understand and can't really help me  


I posted a status on FB to see if anyone could speak to me, or knew who I could speak to about stuff, someone with life experience, almost like a parent would maybe give.  


And silence.   


I just don't know what to do. I have no direction in life. I am completely unhappy and unsatisfied with life in every way. I'm constantly putting a smile on my face despite me feeling the way I do inside. People get on with me, they like me - but i'm putting on an act. What I really feel like is being alone forever on an isolated island with no people to deal with and no worries.  


My girlfriend is about to come home and I feel like bursting into tears. But i'm probably going to pretend nothings happened and carry on burying my horrendously negative feelings.  


My worry is i'm going to suddenly realise in 20 years, when i'm 47, that i've spent most of my life miserable. But I have no idea how to fix that. I want to get my life moving in a positive direction. Help",15Dec2018,1
76,"I don’t really know how to describe this but it’s happened multiple times over the past few years.
I’ve been to therapy for anxiety issues before but I wasn’t able to articulate what this felt like at the time.
E.g if I get bothered by one thing by the person in my relationship i start to go down this rabbit hole of thinking about all these things they are and how they don’t like me and that they will dump me. Then hours later I will feel it’s my fault and that they’ve done nothing wrong and I feel strongly positive about them again and ask for forgiveness when in reality there was a brief argument...

A long time ago I was attacked and I haven’t recovered from the feeling that those people are out to get me. Even when they aren’t.

When I see people of this type... (gay men)

My heart goes really fast, I feel too hot and I get tunnel vision, sometimes I have to sit down or I will faint.  

It’s bad because they are everywhere.

When I was younger and the attack was fresh I drank a lot, I’d get into fights with them. They would usually hit me harder and I felt better. 

Now I’m married and respected, but they are still on my mind all the time. 

Sometimes I have dreams and they are there, sometimes they are sexual and they are affectionate, sometimes they are violent. The worst is I nearly have gay sex then I wake up. Frustrated.  It’s always making me feel guilty when I wake up. 

I have a therapist and it isn’t helping.

I haven’t told her I started to hear voices, in my head, and they are sometimes in my ears too. When I wake up or go to sleep they say things. I’ve not been sleeping because of it.

79,"Hello, im 19 years old and i have issues with depression and anxiety, but no conditions associated with memory loss or anything obvious that could be making this happen. 

For the past few years ive had issues with memory, situations where i would arrive somewhere and have to ask my friends if we walked or drove because i didnt remember the journey. This happened a couple of times a month, but i never paid much attention to it and brushed it off as having a bad memory. 

However recently it has gotten worse. The most recent examples include forgetting chunks of time that are hours long. For example, once i went cycling and went to visit my boyfriend, and when i got there we had a very important and serious discussion about our relationship and some issues in it. We resolved this and i went for a nap, and then came back into the living room to see my boyfriend and then i began having a moment of worry, where everything seemed wrong, i couldnt recognise my own feet and i was scared that beyond the windows of the flat we were in the world had disappeared, and i felt like something catastrophic was about to happen. 

I realised i had no memory of this when i was talking to him a few days later and i began making, word for word, the same points as i had in our conversation. It was at this point where we both realised i had forgotten about 3 or 4 hours of time. 

Recently as well, i had an argument with him and an hour later i realised i didnt remember the argument or what i did after. I only knew i had a shower after the argument because my hair was still damp. 

Its like my brain goes somewhere else and trying to remember is like trying to recall a dream that you can barely grasp. Its scary and i dont like that its getting worse. 

Is this cause for concern? Does anyone know what this could be? ",15Dec2018,1
80,"I would like to preface this with the facts that mental disorders/illnesses (including bipolar and depression) are prevalent in my family history and my brother has ADHD which I know can be comorbid with other disorders. I am 18, my brother and the subject of this post is 25, and my other brother is 20. We all live at home.

So my brother (25) lives at home as he has been going to college and has switched his major a few times. I don't want to say he's always had some emotional problems because as siblings, of course we argue a lot, but I'm not sure if it is his personality at this point to act this way or if it something beyond that. He has always been pretty emotional, where he gets upset over little things and angry at people easily. I write this now because he just blew up on me for moving my hand away when he tried to reach for a chip from a bag I was eating.

He has this idea that he lives in an abusive household (which, though we're not perfect, I can say is far from true) even though he does most of the yelling and fighting around here. He gets very hung up about his ideas on property to an almost obsessive point. He is fixated on certain events like that I stole his ds as a little kid and even though many, many years have past, he brings it up constantly. He believes everyone uses his stuff and no one else wants to share (despite living in my parents' house rent free his entire life, eating their food, etc). When he gets angry, which is often, he demands that no one may touch his belongings.  These don't sound like much, but they are a lot to handle because they are constant.

It's easier to ignore his behavior except for the fact that he directs much of his anger at our mom. Sometimes it seems he genuinely believes she is the root for everything that has gone wrong in his life. This has become a much more obvious problem since recently he absolutely blew up at my mom for supposedly not defending him in what seemed to us as a petty squabble between him and other brother about him putting his stuff in the way. Sounds harmless right? Well, as soon as my other brother left the house, he came around screaming at my mom about how she doesn't support him and all sorts of nonsense conclusions. I'm not kidding when I say this was a grown man screaming at the top of his lungs, despite us keeping our tones civil and body language as non offensive as possible. It was so much, that I ended up leaving the room because at some points he can be downright scary.

He has been physical with me and my other brother before and has recently gotten into a fist fight with him. I'm unsure of the details but I believe it was over turning a light switch off.  He also attacked me when I was rude to him for being in the bathroom when I asked him not to watch me put my contacts in and he refused.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize a lot of this sounds like petty sibling stuff, but it is quite worrying and stressful to have this constant negativity and know its difficult to interact with him and not end up in an argument. I just want to know if this sounds like maybe an emotional problem or something he can get help for or if he is simply a selfish, emotional, and aggressive personality type.",15Dec2018,1
81,"I'm not sure where to post about this so I hope this is a good subreddit. Anyway, I love my daughter. She's so sweet and cute and as perfect as a person can be in my eyes. But I am so unfit to be her mother. 

I was 18 and still a senior in high school when I had her, and I did not want to be a mother at all. But I live in a small, Christian conservative town and getting an abortion while still dependent on my parents would not have been possible. They and all of my doctors talked me into keeping the baby, even though the father had been abusing me. As soon as I had our baby, he left. 

I had been diagnosed with depression long before I gave birth, and after I had her, it got worse. At one point I stopped cleaning and feeding myself for days at a time. I now have a diagnosis of BPD and my mental health is tanking. I can't afford proper mental health treatment so I just silently suffer through it. I love my daughter but I don't even feel like her mother sometimes. There's times where I feel like I have no escape and I do think about killing myself, but then I realize it would be selfish of me. But I have attempted before and it's done enough damage to land me in the hospital, but not enough to actually kill me (obviously). 

It's hard to juggle a job, money, mental health and a child. Some days I feel higher functioning than others, but lately I can hardly function bc I'm so overwhelmed. I don't know what to do.

85,"I do have depression and anxiety. I have been dealing with this since i was roughly 12, so i know the drill. After having the most horrific emotional experience in high school, it took me YEARS but i finally figured out how to handle my depression and anxiety. I am honestly very stable and i credit myself for that considering i was an emotional wreck during my teen years. 

I’m 20 now and i just finished up finals and i came home for the holidays. Usually i’m ecstatic when i come home because it’s nice to get away from the whole college scene. However, this time i wasn’t ready to go home. In fact i wanted to stay. 

I just became an official “thing” with this guy i have been trying to win over all semester (yay) and things were going amazing. Things still are going amazing, he’s just super busy with work and i haven’t seen him or really talked to him since Tuesday. I’m not upset or anything because i’m extremely understanding. I guess i just miss him. We planned to meet up this week and i’m excited because like i said, i miss spending time with him and i miss being around him. 

I think part of me wanted to stay because of him, but i’m not entirely sure. I love my friends there. I just didn’t want to leave at all.

Now, mind you i am a party girl. I love going out and drinking. I am always the one that’s completely down to go out, however like any other human being i have weekends where i’m just not feeling it and i stay in and watch movies. Tbh i love doing that more sometimes. 

When i got home last Tuesday i instantly went to bed. It was 9pm. I usually stay up past midnight but for whatever reason my body was tired. I ending up sleeping for 14 hours. The next few days i didn’t do anything at all considering i start work on Monday. But i continued to sleep for at least 10 hours everyday leading up to today. I have had absolutely no desire to do anything productive expect lay in bed. My body and my mind are exhausted and i haven’t had any desire to talk to anyone or see anyone. 

On Thursday my friend was texting about going out. My group consists of two other girls and they’ve been my friends since high school. It’s always been us three but considering they went to the same grammar school and i didn’t, they’re a lot closer to one another. They usually hangout one-on-one more, always go out together whether i’m there or not, leave without me. They also have this system where they split a bucket and Vegas bombs (for those who don’t know, these are just shots) and they never include me in them. This leads me to having to pay for all of that by myself. I’m used to it by now, but it hurts my feelings sometimes. 

So on Thursday Ashley (one of my friends) mentioned going out. I said i would happily go out with her, and instantly she asked “Colleen can you go?” (Colleen is my other friend in our trio). Colleen said she wouldn’t be home until super late and said she probably wouldn’t make it out. This led to Ashley being conflicted if she even wanted to go. She kept saying she would rather all of us go out... 

I told her it was fine then and we didn’t have to. She was more than okay with that. I ended up doing nothing that night and going to sleep early. Again, sleeping around 11 hours. 

I woke up the next morning on Friday and already they were talking about going out. I wasn’t feeling well to begin with so i didn’t answer the group message right away. Around 5 o’clock my stomach hurt really bad and i just wasn’t in the mood to go out at all. I told them i didn’t feel good and i probably wouldn’t go out. They didn’t answer, and this morning i saw they went out. 

Now i’m not pouting that they went out without me. I’m not going to hold them back because i didn’t want to go out. But it just bothers me that they were okay going out without me but when Colleen couldn’t, ashley didn’t want to at all. Idk. Maybe i’m just being unreasonable. 

I was supposed to go to a concert tonight to see one of my favorite bands, but i cancelled on my friend Dan saying something came up and i wouldn’t be able to make it. This is so weird of me because i love this band and i love going to concerts. I was so excited all week to see them and then i just cancel on my friend. The reasoning for it is because i’m too tired and not mentally prepared to see a band. Like my body and mind physically cannot be at a concert tonight. And i love concerts. 

Idk what’s wrong with me. I don’t understand. Part of me doesn’t even want to go out tonight either. I just want to lay in bed and watch tv. I have been super agitated too. I keep snapping at my family and telling them to “get out” when they come in my room to talk to me. I’m just overall emotionless. Every laugh and smile is fake. I just don’t get it. I think i’m becoming depressed but it’s never been like this before. 

Can someone give me some insight? I haven’t wanted to talk to anyone about this at all. ",15Dec2018,1
86,"This has been something I've put off for years and years, but I'm going to finally make my boring story known in hopes that maybe some good will come of it. Let me start from the earliest I can remember.

From a young age my family was in trouble. We never had any money, and anything we did have my dad would take and spend on himself. We sometimes didn't eat, we were left on our own a lot, and we were instilled with the fear of God as our parents always shouted at us or each other. I say us as I also include my brother, who is 2 years older and doing good stuff.

During primary school I was always the odd one out. I was outcast, bullied, and often told I was too quiet. I lived with it until the last couple of years of primary, around 8 years of age. That's when the aggression, the violence, and the suicidal thoughts started. I'm always reminded that I'll always spend more of my life wanting to die than wanting to live which sucks. Anyway I became very loud, teachers were telling me to be more quiet, and I essentially joined the bullies and gained a cult following of younger kids because of my strange outbursts and lack of respect for the adults. It was around this time I was finally diagnosed with Apergers Syndrome, Clinical depression and Anxiety. I wasn't told about this until I was 10, after my parents had divorced and my mother had met someone new, my father in law to be of 8 years.

I headed into secondary school and got on well, with a fair amount of new bullies but also new friends, they were all new as I was the only person from my primary to go to that secondary. My grades were good, I saw my dad fairly often, step dad was considering moving in and my mental conditions weren't showing up too much. Then when I was between 12 and 13, I went off the rails. I'd been on a certain anti depressant for a while, but there were fears it was messing with my weight as it went up and down kilos at a time. I also started using friction to remove skin from my hands and arms, as I'd done rarely in primary. I brought alcohol into school, making multiple people get pretty pissed off at me as well as landing me in deep trouble with the school. It was clear my state was going down, and that I was becoming a danger to myself and potentially others, and so I started school counselling and more visits to my psychologist and psychiatrist. Treatment had been relatively small and unneeded until now.

My medications changed, and I was given medication to stop me seeing and hearing things which weren't there. They believed it was just my autism or general paranoia but later on this was proven to be wrong. Things went up and down for years, seeing and hearing less from my dad, finances again becoming a struggle, and a family feud I'll discuss now, as until I was sixteen my health was up and down without any real major events occurring.

My step dad was originally married, but got a divorce when he found his wife had cheated on him. She took the kids, took all his money, and only through perseverance did he get to see them again. But the ex wife then used this against him, saying that me, my mum and my brother were abusing the kids and threatened them both sexually and physically. This ruined me. I lost trust in those I loved, and I felt betrayed above all else. I took up a great interest in knives and sharp edges, and became increasingly more violent in my head until I turned 16. That year it got even worse.

Within the first month of the year, after my health had been tossed about like a boat in a storm, my brother tried to kill himself by drinking and driving. All my thoughts and talk of suicide seemed like nothing compared to what he was going through, so I further hardened my exterior to ensure nobody knew of my issues. It was that year that I moved into further education, the step before university. And this is where the main event happened. Where my will to write this came from.

I lost a lot of friends who moved to other places, which was sad but tolerable with the close friends who stayed with me. I was optimistic, my GCSE grades were good and I thought that the next two years would be fine. I met some new people, mainly girls as I'd been in an all boys environment until then. I liked them, they were nice people and eventually I got to know them. One of them had mental issues like me, and through talking to them I started cutting. Uncontrollably. Everything I wore hurt my skin and always had to stain or smell of blood on it. I collected pencil sharpeners to harvest their blades for use. I started talking about my problems, ruining the lives of those around me. I was angry. Distant. Selfish. And I kept cutting day after day, until I was covered in just over 200 individual cuts all over my body. I still bear some on my chest which never healed, adding to the older scars from when I was younger. After multiple breakdowns things plateaued, then spiked as I told a girl about my feelings. I was rejected, and then my second half was born. His name is Dregulon, I know, the name is the epitamy of edginess, but that's what he's called. He embodied my self hatred, and the lack of worth I feel I have. Its then that the suicide threats became more frequent, arguments kept on happening and all I'd remember is reading as someone else typed using my hands under another name. I attempted a medication overdose. I failed and fell again into a sombre state, not trying to cut or die, just being silent, not talking to anyone. When I did finally start talking again, my grades slipped, my feeling for people grew more intense and things just wouldn't get better. On top of this, I had no more counselling, no more psychologist, and my psychiatrist had changed. I was receiving no help as my condition got worse. My brother moved away and after his accident he refused to speak to my dad, making him even more distant from me. It felt like my family hated me, my dad didn't call, my brother never wanted to play games with me, my step dad always yelled, and my mother took up a saying that I was something truly evil, that I was born of the devil and not of her. I felt alone, so I reached out to everyone I could. I didn't think before acting, and so I made it worse again. I had feelings again for other people. The first promised me a chance, so I worked damn hard to stop cutting and talking about death. They then dated someone who moved abroad, breaking our promise and again shattering my faith in those I trust. I started disappearing from school to visit bridges, watching the traffic and finding the confidence to jump. I never did. One day came where my friends found me at the bridge, and I felt like finally things had changed for the better. But soon after it started up again. Cutting. Visiting bridges, ruining relationships. The school kicked me out eventually, and some of my friends cut contact. Soon after I was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, and I finally just gave up. The one girl I loved above all else left, and everyone since I've pushed away with my stupid problems. So we come to now.

My name is Ben, I'm 18 years of age and I've tried to kill myself more times than I've had birthdays. I've tried cuts, strangulation, bridges and overdoses, but I've either survived or not tried hard enough. As my family have said, if I wanted to die I would've done it by now, so obviously I want to live for some reason or other. I recently alienated myself, cutting contact with every friend I've ever known. Even the ones I see every day. I've started cutting again, deeper than ever before, and worry that this could be the beginning of the end. I miss my friends. I miss my dad. I miss the me that laughed and smiled instead of carving words into his arms with a sharpener blade. I've talked to so many great people, and I've always been the problem. I caused the divorce. I caused the court cases. I caused my friends to get depression and worry about the slightest things. My name is Ben. I'm worth nothing to myself or my family. I'm told that I should just go die. I'm always the problem. This is my long, boring and self pitying story. Thank you for your time, and I love you all. ",15Dec2018,1
87,"So I noticed that I am able to regain a bit of stability by fasting. When I eat, I just feel guilty and the regret knocks me out.
But when I don't eat, I actually get a bit of energy again.
Although, when I do that, people around me start complaining and patronise me, telling me I need to eat.
If fasting eases the suicidal thoughts, surely that's the better option?",15Dec2018,1

90,I was diagnosed with anxiety but I feel like I have PTSD. Every day is a series of multiple small-scale panic attacks I seem to be able to manage but at the end of the day it’s super draining and after a couple days it ends in a big breakdown.

92,"I feel down all the time for no reason. Nothing bad has happened to me lately, and nothing makes me want to do anything. Activities seem pointless. I jut feel down for no reason. Not that I feel like crying, but just a ache. Like a mental ache. I find it hard to find enjoyment out of anything. Nothing makes me happy. I’m not sad, just not happy. Like mental purgatory. I feel like I have no emotion. This post will probably be buried and I’m fine with that. I just want some confirmation that I’m not going crazy for not feeling anything emotionally.

93,"First, if I'm not on the right sub, please let me know.


I'm not looking for a medical profession help or anything like that. I just want someone to let it all out to without judgement. 

I'm just so fucked up mentally, I have things some things I need to get off my chest that I'm not comfortable telling a councillor or just anyone I know. I really want to just have a conversation with a stranger about everything that's happened in my life, what I'm always thinking, the lies I've told, the things I've done I'm not proud off. 

I'm not good at conversations, especially more so when it comes to what I'm thinking or how I'm feeling. 

Just someone to let it out, someone who will just understand what questions to ask and stuff. Some messages would be long, some would be one or two words.

95,"I'm 18, and I've been having a really tough time processing my first break-up. In all honesty, the guy wasn't really great, and looking back on it he did not put that much effort into our relationship. But I keep thinking about it. We only dated for like five months, but when we broke up he told me that he never actually loved me and he felt bad for lying to me for so long. I feel like a fool for believing that someone could care about me, and I feel so pathetic for caring about him at all. I feel like I can't openly be sad about it or talk to anyone about it, because I feel so gross and stupid for having feelings for him. We haven't spoken since we broke up, he's in college now, we saw each other in public once but ignored each other. I feel like I have no closure, and I feel like such a fool.

97,"Ever since I was a kid, I have wanted to be a dog. I don’t know why, but that desire has been a constant for me for as long as I can remember and has never really faded or gone away. Sure, my childhood wasn’t the greatest, but the feeling has always felt beyond influence of personal experience. 

All through elementary and middle school, I knew I could get away with doing some doglike things (like barking at cars and playing fetch) to satisfy that feeling at the expense of being the “weird kid,” but since that outlet for these strong feelings went away at the start of high school, the desire or need to be a dog has just been growing.

I’m a junior in college now and that want to be a dog is stronger than ever. I’m a happy guy with a lot of friends, steady income and a good attitude working towards my degree, but that feeling has just been getting overwhelming. Sometimes I’ll miss the majority of a class discussion because I’m just zoned out thinking about being a golden retriever. I have been having trouble getting to sleep at night because this feeling of longing pervades my mind. Heck, I didn’t sleep at all last night just thinking about it all night.

I’ve started trying to incorporate any possible outlets I can, like I did in middle school, just to try and diminish the feeling. Often I’ll go out into the forest at 3am just to bark at nothing until I get tired or I’ll find some place with no light sources and run around on all fours until I’m covered with grass cuts. It sounds absolutely *insane*! I feel like a fucking lunatic just writing about it!

I’ve started trying to incorporate some doglike personality traits into who I am to satiate that desire in a way and I have compiled a whole list of traits like excitable, optimistic, loyal, kind, generous, loving, honest, innocent, impulsive, playful, energetic, curious, carefree, and more to start embracing, but despite this I still have that desire tearing away at me. Sure, I feel better after an early morning barking session, but that relief only lasts for a few days to a week before the desire hits as strong as ever.

I’m a completely normal, reasonable adult college guy. I like making music with my guitar, acting and hanging with my friends. I have a passion for languages and graphic design! I love hiking and going to the gym! I’m normal in every other way, I lead an awesome life and I’m that one guy that everyone likes, so why the* **fuck** *am I constantly plagued by this desire to be a dog?!

I’m not even interested in the dog lifestyle! I don’t want to go around peeing on stuff in public! I don’t want to be owned by someone! Why in God’s green Earth can I not shake this feeling?! It’s just there every hour of the day, my mind constantly begging for the impossible! Even in my dreams! I’m always a golden retriever in every dream and it’s always been like that! It makes me so frustrated!

Is this normal? Is it normal to want to be something you’re not and can never be? Is it normal to sneak out of your apartment in the middle of the night to run off into woods just to bark at nothing? Am I insane? Do I need therapy? Does anyone else ever experience something like this? What is wrong with me?

I’m dead serious, guys. This is not a joke. In advance, thank you so much for your time and your help!

TL;DR: I have always wanted to be a dog, now more than ever, and it has become an overwhelming desire. Is this normal? What can I do to stop it?",15Dec2018,1
98,"New here, just looking for help. 

Sister just started up at Ivy League law school in August. Before starting, she made it her mission to get off her ocd/anxiety medication over the summer, which she’s been on for 10 years. Since then, she’s been really struggling, Her social anxiety has prevented her from finding friend support at school and she is too nervous/depressed to visit a doctor.  After going to visit her mid year, I made her get back on her old meds to find that it really hasn’t done anything. 

She’s now coming up on finals and I have never seen her so bad, so I flew out for the weekend to watch over her. 

I was absolutely shocked when I saw her. She has bruises everywhere from hitting herself, she broke her chair while having a panic attack and has to scream about every 30 mins before she has an all out anxiety attack. Needless to say I took her to the hospital but they don’t seem to be helping unless I let her stay over. I’m in the waiting room right now and I’m looking for advice

1) I called my parents and they took off work to come watch over her this weekend 

2) is there anyway we can get accommodations to get her extra time for finals. She is downright suicidal when we suggest that she withdrawals from school 

Really advice helps, her finals start on Monday ",15Dec2018,1
99,"Start off by saying that I do have friends and a great family, so it's not loneliness in the most basic sense.

Basically, the moment I'm not doing something with someone, I immediately feel useless and incredibly lonely. Today for example, my flatmate is out and friends were busy so I've just sat in the same place all day doing nothing. This happens whenever people go out. 

I play plenty of sports and I love my job, but I've noticed that within half an hour of being alone, I start feeling terrible and sad and pointless. I have been diagnosed with anxiety before, but I just can't see how to solve this. I can't just force myself upon people because I'm lonely and therefore they have to spend time with me. 

It hasn't helped that I've been single for 4 years and haven't been on a date (Not through lack of trying). 

Just wondered if anyone else gets this and what they do to help? Like I say it's not that I don't go out and do things, but the moment I'm not doing things, I'm completely miserable.

TIA for any advice.",15Dec2018,1
100,"I have a history of being an angry person. I'm good at keeping it under wraps in public, but not so much around loved ones. I don't lasg out physically barring the few times I've bloodied my knuckles punching walls. I usually just curse at everything and can't help but talk about how much things/people upset me. I curse at everything when I'm by myself, and slightly less but still a lot when I'm around my wife. I know it's not healthy to be so angry, but it feels like I can't help it sometimes. When I'm not angry, I'm sad and sometimes crying. My wife has had enough of my anger and I fear she may divorce me. What is wrong with me? I know I'm awful and rotten inside, and I hate myself for it, but no matter how many times I try to pull myself out of it, I always end up right back where I started. Sometimes I feel tempted to say I'm depressed, but I hate that so many people self-diagnose and I refuse to be part of the problem, but I don't have money to see a professional that could diagnose me.

102,"God dammit!!!!! Another wasted day and I actually wanted to go to the library, but I woke up too late and it wouldn't have been worth it. And the rest of the day I did nothing but watch stuff on the internet and feeling miserable. 

A part of me has realized that maybe, just maybe, I might not be able to do this alone. I don't know. I think I need help. I'm doing less than acceptable and my inability to do anything is going to bite me in the ass, even more than before! But I'm reluctant to seek help. I don't want to be judged for being lazy :( Even if I know I am, it still hurts to hear someone else say it. 

I can't open up to anyone because I know that I'll be judged. They're just gonna say 
""If only you had planned ahead."" 
""Why didn't you do your homework before the deadline?"" 
""Why did you waste your time on the internet?"" 
""It's your own god damn fault!"" 

I know thag they're right. I didn't do what I should have done, okay?! I can't turn back time, and there's no need to guilt trip me! You can't hate me more than I already hate myself so please just spare me!
