0,"This all started in elementary school, when I began picking at the top layer of my lips. When they were chapped, I would pull off the dead skin on them. I think this is a pretty common habit, but it extended into way worse impulses later on.

I have a memory from early middle school of someone showing me that you can stick a pin through the very top layer of skin on your finger without it hurting (sorry if I didn't describe that very well). For whatever reason I guess I was really enthralled by this and started doing it all the time. At some point I started pulling the affected skin off of my fingers with my teeth and chewing on it. 

I'm so embarrassed about this, but I later started sticking pins through the skin on the soles of my feet, too. Somehow this spiraled into me using a nail clipper to snip off skin on both my feet and my fingers. I would chew this skin, too. 

Over time, it hurt a lot to walk because my feet were all cut up, so I gradually stopped doing this to my foot skin. I think this made my impulse to pull off my finger skin much worse, though. I don't know when, but at some time I transitioned into biting rather than picking. I'm now 18 and the skin around my fingernails is still all mangled.

On a daily basis, I absentmindedly bite at my fingers all the time, and I still chew on my lips, too. I rarely notice what I'm doing, but even when I catch myself I feel like I can't stop. Usually about once a week I have more severe ""episodes"" where I bite at my fingers and lips even when it's really painful and they start bleeding. This sometimes happens out of stress, but for the most part I think it's random.

This makes me feel so embarrassed and ashamed. I never thought about people noticing that I did this until about two years ago when one of my teachers scolded me for it. Since then it's tortured me. I can't help but do it, even in public, but I hate knowing that other people clearly notice it and are so grossed out by it.

I really really really want to just stop being like this. I told a friend about it a few months and he said that ""The truth is all you have to do is just stop"" which I guess is true. I don't know why I haven't been able to do it. I will consciously resist it when I get an urge to start picking/chewing but I always give in and feel horrible about it. I know a lot of people have a habit of biting at their skin but I've never seen someone with fingers as bitten up as mine. I feel like a freak. 

I'm so sorry if this grossed anyone out. If anyone has any advice or similar experiences I would love to hear it, thank you so much

This was around the 1 year mark, they broke up and we started talking more and started hooking up and staying over each other's places, etc. 

Then a month ago we took a valentines day weekend trip out of town together and I asked her to be my legit girlfriend. She said ""I'm just not ready yet it has nothing to do with you it's just I got out of a years long relationship and I always jump into things and I don't want to yet"" I said "" ok, but it's not like it's jumping we have known each other for over a year now but ok I understand we will stay where we are"" .

Then she became short and started fightig about everything i said and said im really pushy and annoying for asking how her day was or if she wanted to get dinner days in advance just so I know it's not last minute and she's busy. 

Now it's st. Pattys day and she went on a 4 day weekend with a bunch of her guy friends to another big Irish town to drink all weekend and barely talking to me. But she assured me before she left that we are still ok and I have nothing to worry about and me and her are fine and it's all in my head.

She has had several health issues that have left her unable to physically do much.

14,"I am a first year college student. The summer going into my senior year of high school is when I had my first, of many, pseudo seizures. It looks just like a “real”seizures as my doctors said but it’s caused mentally by a trigger or emotions. I’ve been taking medicines for depression and anxiety, (I have those and PTSD) and I just recently had to have my prescription switched because it was expensive... since then things have been weird. If someone gasps or makes a noise of any concern even a small one I go instantly into panic mode asking over and over what’s wrong until they answer me. (Usually them not even noticing and almost ignoring me asking which makes me panic more). I have had it multiple times now too where out of nowhere it’s like everything picks up speed and enhances; lights get brighter, cars get faster, noises get louder, and my brain is the only thing that slows down. It’s almost like I can’t process anything fast when it’s happening. Someone goes to put their hand by my face and I panic and in my head it’s like “woah woah woah what’s happening hand hand hand” and constant repeating of words in my head “grass grass grass” “close close close” but even though a LOT of it is scary I still am more so confused than anything where it seems I will just keep loudly repeating “WOW, WOAH. WOOUWWWW”  and repeat. It’s exhausting and makes my head hurt. But I don’t know what to do. I especially don’t know what I’m going to do when I go back to college tomorrow because it was extremely and even nearly impossible to focus on any one thing during this time. *grass, van, grass, chocolate” and now I can remember certain parts of it but why do I remember that? Why do I remember the order? *grass, van, grass, chocolate, car FAST, door OPEN*  I would just love to not feel like this because it seems like lately even when it’s not THAT bad, (ex. Right now) I still feel it in my chest like I have something small but extremely heavy in the center of my chest pulling down and I still hear the voice *door door door dark dark dark* it has to be in threes.

17,"So basically I have brief periods of depression (2 weeks) followed by slightly longer periods of extreme happiness (1 month) with transitional periods lasting a few days. Those are the toughest to deal with and sometimes I will get a full episode around 2-4 weeks when I’m both at the same time.

I am currently in therapy and have tried antidepressants but reacted very badly to them.

I am finding ways to manage this and even use it to my advantage. So far the ideas I have come up with are:

1. During depressive episodes I write down all the problems I see in the world (when you’re depressed you can see negativity that others ignore) and then when manic start finding solutions and implementing them (I’m involved with several charity groups and social programs)

2. Make a budget and give myself an allowance for fun purchases so I don’t cause problems by overspending when I’m in a good mood and get caught up in the excitement.

3. Follow a waiting period for major decisions to prevent causing problems with impulsive behavior which happens when in a happier phase.

4. Distracting myself with exercise and “busy work” (cleaning, embroidery, gardening and cooking) when depressed.

5. Allocating tasks involving physical exertion, creativity and sociability to happier periods and tasks involving meticulousness and order to depressive episodes.

6. I made a contract with myself and showed it to my therapist saying that I would not be by myself during break when depressed, I would not sleep more than 9 hours per day when depressed including naps (excluding cases of physical illness) and when manic I would not stay up past midnight on Friday Saturday or Sunday and not past eleven on other days.

21,"I was getting dropped home by my fiancé today when a man (let's call him Bob) approached our car. I wound the window down to address him as he approached before he launched into a rant about how the world hates him, and he's getting death threats, as well as other profanities. I attempted to calm him down (despite my fight or flight instinct going into flight overdrive), and he eventually left to walk down the street.

Not long after, Bob returned with a similar rant (I was still in the car with my fiancé) and I once again managed to remain calm and talk to him about it. I stepped out of the car, got my lady to leave and drive home, and continued to talk with him. By this point, Bob had spoken about some hardships in his life and had admitted to me that he had a diagnosis of schizophrenia (didn't specify type, though from the symptoms I suspect it's paranoid). I kept talking with him, walked him home, and eventually left to walk back to my house (a few doors down).

I can't stop thinking about Bob and how to help him. I've never been in an encounter with someone with schizophrenia where I've been able to talk with them and calm them down. He said he hates when people call him names like ""retard"" and ""crazy"". I've had some limited education about mental health (I'm a student speech pathologist) so I was able to use what little I did know to let him know that someone kind of understands him. I asked if he'd called any of the support services like the suicide hotline (he'd mentioned self-harm), and he said he'd never called but was aware of them.

For reference, I'm Australian (in case somebody knows the system). As the title says, how can I help this man?

Hi!


I am a maladaptive daydreamer for a while now. Ever since I was small, actually.

I am 14 years old, and don't neccessarily live a bad life. There has been abuse, alcohol abuse, neglect and fear in the past. I am confused, but overall, could be so much worse. But it feels as though I was ignorant to it as a child, and even now, I don't feel much thinking about it. So, I never thought it'd bother me. Though, I read this kind of past could be linked to MD? 

My daydreams follow me during the whole day actually. Sometimes, I simply imagine doing whatever I do with these characters in a different world, other times I imagine the wildest and prettiest of stories.

Downside :

I remember having breakdowns because of this. This is incredibly embarrassing, but I have cried during the past two christmas, sometimes in the past months occasionally simply because they weren't real. I can't seem to see the same beauty in real people and events I find in them. There were times I wished to simply fall into a coma, and live with them. Makes me sound like a loser! But this life is only appealing to an extent. I can't trust real people, their love. I look for the danger in life, to make me feel alive. But I simply feel dead in a way. 

I am worried I'll eventually be living a shallow life. I am cold hearted by nature, seem to lack connection, but my daydreams allow me to work with what I feel, hope for, am thinking about. Short, I cannot imagine a life without it. I don't appear open for real life relationships or strong bonds, because I don't expect anything great. I want to explore this world, adapt skills, get away from here. But  I grow concerned the more I work, accept my obsession, the more I will spiral down ""wonderland"", and lose grip.

24,"I want to start by saying I'm fortunate I have no known mental illnesses, but at the age of 20 I've become increasing less happy and more nihilistic. This is frustrating because I do believe I have a good life with a loving parent, lots of friends, a great part time job and a university degree that motivates me. 

However, it feels like something is holding me back from enjoying all of these great aspects of my life. Over the past few months I have become mildly depressed and things that I used to find fun aren't fun anymore. For example I find that now drinking alcohol and going out, which I only do occasionally, makes me feel very depressed.

In the past when I was in my mid teens I dealt with the loss of my other parent, but being a very diligent student, I didn't have time to deal with it or know how to deal with it and simply moved on with life. I always thought of the loss as less significant because it wasn't the parent I had lived with for all my life (only on weekends). But I now think i'm dealing with some unresolved feelings as i often think about my lost parent and sometimes have had dreams about my lost parent. I still don't know how to feel about it.

Although I have many relationships with people, one of the things I have the most trouble with is talking intimately with people. I feel like this as made me very good at repressing emotions, and putting on a mask. In my friend group I have great friends but no friend I would consider very close (but I feel like this is normal for males). I find it easier to socialise in a group dynamic, where I usually socialise through humour and about more casual subjects. I also don't want to push my problems onto my parent as I feel like I have a happy facade to maintain because that's how I've always been.

Background: I suffer with anxiety that while is (touch wood) much better, I have had bad experiences flying before and benzos don’t help (I’ve taken up to 1.5mg Xanx and didn’t get amazing relief just tired) so my doc prescribed me 40mg of Propranolol (beta blockers). 

1) I want to test one out as I’d be worried taking one for the first time say on the plane not knowing how I’d react. My anxiety is about a 2/10 right now (not high but I’m never totally without the feeling of adrenalin in my body), if I took a pill would I be able to feel it working still? 

2) Is 40mg too high? I’ve never taken beta blockers before. My resting heart rate is 64. 

3) I’m worried this may slow my heart down and I’ll die. Seriously. Any thoughts there? And do beta blockers ONLY help with racing heart because that’s not even my main anxiety symptom - what I really feel is like I need to jump out my skin and escape (fight or flight).

29,"Hello Reddit, I'm a 15 year old Dutch girl (forgive me in advance for any grammar errors) and I'm writing this post because I don't feel so well lately. I find it hard to explain what the matter is, but I'll try to organize the mess in my head the best I can.

What I have experienced:

 – I have lost interest in things I used to enjoy, for example writing and drawing. My general motivation is low.

 – I have become bad at being alone and feel lonely quickly, even though I never had problems with this before.

 – I have mood swings that seem to depend on the day. 
For example, I feel perfectly fine one day, and the next I feel empty, depressed and lost for no apparant reason. Sometimes I'm on the verge of crying for hours without knowing why. I've tried to count good and bad days, and I found that every week has generally about one or two bad days. There are however exeptions with bad days lasting longer. The longest I can think of was three weeks.

 – When frustrated, I have the urge to physically hurt myself, but I never have this urge when I'm sad.

 – The last few weeks, I've had trouble sleeping. I lay awake for hours, and wake up long before my alarm, even though I'm still tired. I do manage to get an average of 8 hours, but there are more lows than I ever had before. When I really can't fall asleep I take Dormeasan, but I try to keep that to a minimum.

 – Often, even on good or neutral days, I experience dissociation, which feels like my brain has lost the connection between outside world me and inside world me, if that even makes sense. The dissociation varies between severe and very light, but rarely stops completely.

This dissociating is not entirely bad, but it scares me sometimes. Yesterday, I found a goodbye message from someone I don't personally know on tumblr. I had seen them post about wanting to die before, so of course such a post was concerning. I tried to message them and find someone who might know them. After a few hours, they finally responded and spoke to me, and I also managed to reach a friend of theirs. 

They are alive and safe right now, but the point I'm trying to make is that I felt nothing at all during the conversation. I comforted them soley on autopilot, using reason rather than emotion. Usually, I'm very emotional and sensitive, especially towards anything revolving around suicide, but now I felt nothing and that can't be normal or healthy. While I'm typing this post, I still feel nothing. 

I am hesitant of seeking professional help or talking to someone at school because:

1. I am still functioning fine in daily life

2. I have more good than bad days

3. I live a very privileged life and don't want to complain because I know others have it worse than me

4. I feel like I should somehow be able to fix things myself

I have talked about my problems with a friend, and they convinced me that this behaviour is not healthy and that I should at least try to get some advice here if I don't want to contact a professional(yet)

My main objective of posting this is trying to get my thoughts straight, but of course I'd like to hear from you guys. Does anyone recognize my problems? Does anyone have an idea of what further steps I could take to make myself feel better, or at least keep things from getting worse?
Something else that I should probably point out is that my family has a history of people with personality disorders, but I don't know to what of a degree this is relevant.

I have a very difficult time adulting. I've gone to college, but I never managed to find a proper job because I would have full on panic attacks whenever I tried to write a job application. Whenever I try to present my good qualities, I feel like I'm going to die. As a result, I've had a lot of crap service jobs, but that also ends in extreme anxiety and depression because I can't deal with the verbal abuse that often comes with those jobs. 

Hubby is fine with me staying at home, and you'd think that would make things easier, but then I feel like a loser and a parasite. I often just run myself into the ground to get all sorts of things done - and then I can still only focus on everything I didn't do and nothing is ever enough. I also worry about eeevery little thing. I have this little baseline of constant fear that never goes away. I have no idea what I'm afraid of. It doesn't need to be directed at anything - although it sure will latch on to just about anything - it's just always there. I'm not sure I've ever not been at least a little bit scared, even on really good days. Some days I'm so terrified of nothing in particular that I can barely leave the house. ive had suicidal thoughts, but have never seriously wanted to kill myself.

Even when I've forced myself for long periods to be social and hard working, I never seem to become less sensitive to...whatever's wrong with me. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just too messed up. My sister was just diagnosed with PTSD and panic disorder, and her psychiatrist thinks she might not be able to return to work.

33,"UPDATE: My mom just called me and said that he tried to break into two homes and was howling and growling at the top of his lungs. They couldn't even get him sedated in the ambulance. They think it is bath salts. 

He has never been a drug user. I can't believe this is happening. He must have gotten something when he was away at the alcohol classes. I can't believe they put a bunch of people together with problems in a hotel. I'm terrified.

--------

I am really worried about my older brother and his mental health. He is 31 and got a DUI back in December. He lost his license for a year and is stuck at my mom's house (he works from home) in Ohio. He recently went through the 72 hour alcohol classes. I'm not exactly sure how they work but he took them a few hours away from home and stayed in a hotel. This was when my mom and I noticed a change. I live in Florida, but he began texting me daily (which is unlike him) and when I tried to have a conversation with him, the responses were short. My mom took him to the ER a few days ago. They assumed he was on drugs, but after a urine and blood sample, they found nothing. His blood pressure was very high and he was pacing. 

My brother and I both suffer from anxiety issues, but we cope with them very differently and different things trigger us. This is why I am asking for help. I am very good at internalizing and finding comfort within myself. Also, I love to exercise and eat right. I've recommended things to him in the past, but he doesn't seem interested in my coping mechanisms. I'm sure he is feeling like a failure right now and that he is moving backwards at 31.

We also both have alcoholic tendencies and prior to his DUI, he was drinking a lot more than he had for years. He is getting to a point where he can't function due to anxiety. I asked him a few months ago to move down to Florida to stay with my boyfriend and I. At least there is sun and we have a gym and pool here at our condo. He didn't seem interested at the time, but I will ask again when I visit next Saturday. 

My mom reached out to our family doctor this morning. What can I do? I'm not sure if he should go somewhere for help?

Sorry for the scattered thoughts. I am really worried. ",18Mar2018,3,
34,"So, yeah. I’ve just reached the point today where I can actually keep food down again following my lone drinking session the day before yesterday. Honestly don’t know what to say. I was depressed, and just started drinking. I felt bizarrely elated for a while, like no drunkenness I’ve ever experienced before, and then things quickly went downhill and my friends had to take care of me while I cried and proceeded to be very ill. I don’t know what to do with myself now. I just hate myself right now.",18Mar2018,1,

37,"I am a 30 year old male who has suffered from mental health issues my whole life. As a kid i was very shy and as early as 7 years old started showing signs of depression. At the age of 12 I started self medicating with pot and alcohol. I was able to keep my head above water and function at work and school until I was 23 and the anxiety and depression got so bad I completely isolated for 6 years and the drug use got worse. After a long struggle of trying to quit and failing I'm finally drug free for almost a year now! Over my life I have seen many psychologists and psychiatrists and was told the same story, that I have a chemical imbalance and with CBT and ssri medication I can live a normal life and the reason they haven't worked for me is they don't work when you use drugs and alcohol. Well after 9 months of sober depression I decided to get another opinion.  I found a therapist who thinks my issue has to do with shame, most likely from childhood trauma. I have no memory of a traumatic event but what I have learned about how trauma affects us as adults has really resonated with me.  I am wondering if anyone could share similar stories of recovery, let me know where to look for good info on shame and trauma and any advice would be helpful, thanks!",18Mar2018,3,

39,"My father has been diagnosed with early onset dementia (which is likely genetic but doctors are extremely doubtful of the prospect of there being no treatment in 30+ years from now. Does definitely bother me occasionally though.) recently. Probably the worst thing that has ever happened to me (and for that I'm thankful), but I've been handling it pretty well. Learned when I came back home from winter vacation, dealt with the news for a month, talked about it, thought it through, and then was much better when I came back.

I was talking to my friend about this stuff recently though, and he said some justifications for not feeling too bad, like that ""I was never really THAT close to him, so it isn't as rough as if it was, like, YOUR dad or something"" was a wall I was building for myself and was a masculine suppression of my emotions in order to be able to get on with my life. He said crying about it as much as possible is good - that never suppressing the need to feel bad no matter the time is the healthiest thing to do. Make no walls for yourself to hide behind when the thoughts arise. That got me thinking - how should I approach this? Should I follow his advice? I didn't know that the thing I said was me building a wall up in the first place. 

Should I follow his advice? Or do something else? What's the healthiest way to deal with this sort of thing so that I can be as productive and happy as I possibly can? There are things expected of me - deadlines to meet. I want to be able to meet them to feel happy.",18Mar2018,1,

Every time I wake up it's to a panic attack so severe that I can't get out of bed, I haven't been able to eat solid foods in almost a week because I freak out and throw them up, the hospital doesn't help, my parents had to bring me back home because I can't take care of myself anymore, and I'm positive I'm going to die and there's nothing I can do about it. This just started on Tuesday and I have no way to cope with it, I used to smoke weed for my anxiety but my therapist said to stop and now I don't have any coping mechanisms to deal with it, ive tried deep breathing and mindfulness meditation and they just give  me more anxiety now because I associate them with having a panic attack, all I can do is cry alone and be afraid. I don't feel comfortable with any of my friends or my parents anymore and I don't know why because they're all great people, but I'm too scared to use them as a resource, and I don't know where else to turn. This can't be normal. The only way I can get through the day is to take an Ativan but I know they're addictive and that terrifies me too, whenever I need one I just freak out over the pill for a while and usually can't take it unless prompted on the phone by my therapist, who probably hates me now because of all the times I've had to call him this week. And even when I take it, I'm still useless until the afternoon because even mornings freak me out. I had just moved to Boston and had a nice apartment and was about to start my dream job, and now I'm not sure I'll be able to even start, these panic attacks are literally ruining my life, all I wanted was to help people and now I can't even help myself. I'm so scared, I just want to feel normal again but I have no idea what to do, or what my anxiety will even let me do. I didn't realize it could get this bad and even through all of this I still find myself hating myself because I'm not strong enough to deal with it, and I can't convince myself otherwise.

46,"Hello All,
I am a college senior and at a pretty big transitional time in my life. Ending college, applying to post-grad programs, having to balance a relationship with school, hopefully a career in medicine which comes with its own stressors, and now a health scare in the family. Within the past 6 months, my dad has developed a bad cough and breathing (not even a smoker or anything), and within the past week went in for a lung biopsy. My family and I have been as supportive as we could be. I thankfully go to school close enough and was able to take a few days off and spend them with him pre and post-op. The biopsy surgery in itself is a stressful venture since anytime you're put under and having your vital chest area cut open anything could happen. 

The operation went well and he felt little pain the following days, and things seemed good for the situation. I returned to school, but the next few days I felt extremely fidgity and my usual axiety and ADHD were magnified. I have been trying to be so much for my family, my sisters, my mom, and importantly my dad that I hadn't stopped to focus on myself. Things boiled over when I completely broke down to my girlfriend and basically cried myself to sleep overcome with a feeling of dread, overstressed and uncertain of what could come of the biopsy.

A few days later, I received an acceptance letter from my #1 choice for a grad program. I was elated, and for a few hours was filled with this hopeful good feels that is usual for me. I called my parents, and personally, there really is no better feeling than hearing how proud they were. I checked in with my dad, and he seemed well, no update from the doctor yet on the biopsy. 

Beginning to celebrate with my friends over some beers, I received a facetime call from my parents. They didn't want to put a damper on my initial excitement but received word that morning that the biopsy results were in and in some f'ed up realist irony, it's the worst option the doctor predicted. While not cancer or something that will kill him in months, the results show that what he has will most likely progress... and with something so vital as someone breathing/oxygen into your other vital regions, there will likely be other co-morbidities that will arise. This also extremely jeopardizes the financial stability of my family, seeing that he will need to take expensive medicine, and will most likely retire earlier than expected. While financials take a back seat to my dad's well-being, this stress falls a majority on me. Seeing that if things do turn bad, my mom has little experience with the financial sides of life and I feel responsible to help her. 

These past three days I have been trying my best to be realistic, optimistic. Having a supportive and hopeful supporting cast shows to drastically improve health outcomes, and I know I need to play that role. 

I'm afraid that this will break me down and take unforeseen tolls on my own mental health. Seeing that in the past three days I have had uncontrolled and seeming random triggered episodes, I know I need to find a healthy way to cope. Honestly, any suggestions are appreciated, and frankly, posting this here is probably a good start for me. I'm not usually the one to journal or write because of time but also because it's hard to reel in my own scattered thoughts.

50,"People of reddit, I need your help. This is going to be a very long story but I’m at my wits end. 

I’m 25/f, he’s 26/m. We live in the USA. TL;DR at the bottom. 

When I met my husband 5 years ago, he was the most positive, happy, outgoing, fun person in the world. Every time I looked at him he had the biggest, cheesiest smile on his face. He loved life and he loved me, and he was the most amazing man I had ever met. We fell head over heels for each other and were inseparable. 

His passion was motorcycles. He rode his street bike everywhere and was good at it. It was his outlet for the few times he was angry, and he always came back from rides happier and more positive. He got me hooked on riding and I got a bike of my own. We went for rides together and really enjoyed everything about it. Then, three years into our relationship, he was in an accident. I had ridden to work one day and he was riding in to surprise me so we could go on a scenic ride on the way home. When he was only two miles away from me, a man made a left turn in front of my husband. He t-boned the car, lost consciousness, and landed on the other side in the middle of the street. I had no idea that he was anywhere but at home waiting for me, so I left work and drove right past the accident scene. My husband was rushed to the hospital with a category 5 shattered spleen, severe head injury, broken wrist, and huge gash in his knee. I wasn’t notified until I got home nearly an hour later, and had to be driven to the hospital, as I was a complete mess. They wouldn’t tell me anything besides the fact that he was currently breathing. This is a good time to mention that I have suffered from depression, anxiety, OCD, and panic attacks my whole life. On the way to the hospital, the only thing I could think of was that even if he lived, our lives were over as we knew it. We had a trip booked for the next week to go to California, and I knew that his plans were to propose to me there. My life came crashing down and never really picked back up. 

After a long stay in the ICU, my husband was finally released. He was weak and in pain for a very long time, and I did everything I could to make him comfortable. He would spend all night groaning and crying in his sleep, trying to get comfortable with his ruptured spleen. He couldn’t work for weeks, and had no other hobbies besides his motorcycle, which had been totaled and was sitting in a scrap yard. He became understandably depressed for the first time in his life, and I tried to fight through my depression to make his less painful. He started to have extreme mood swings, but we decided that it was all part of the healing process and a side effect of the pain medication. 

As he slowly got better, the mood swings never stopped. He would be his old, smiley self one day, and wake up the next in an inexplicable rage. He would scream at me, throw things, give me the silent treatment, storm out of the house, and hide in the basement for hours. I begged him to be seen by a doctor for his head injury, thinking that it was more serious than we originally thought. He was in denial that anything was wrong with him, and would storm out of the room anytime I calmly brought it up. He finally went and was diagnosed with depression and PTSD, and prescribed Wellbutrin and a therapist. His family was so worried for my safety at this point that they tried to have an intervention with him, which didn’t end well. On several occasions I watched him blow up and scream in his parents faces over silly things. He would test boundaries and drive erratically, constantly getting angry in the car and then speeding, tailgating, and whipping around turns. When he went to the therapist, it was one of his good days. He charmed his way out of the whole thing, and the therapist told him there was no reason to come back for another session. He then quit taking the Wellbutrin, assuming that he was healed and saying that it never really did anything anyway. He bought another motorcycle, but was too afraid to ride it. He had it for a year and a half before getting rid of it, and never even took it for a single ride. 

We finally did go on that vacation to California and he acted like his old self the entire time. I was so happy to have him back, and overjoyed when he asked me to marry him. The trip was amazing, but it was one of the last good memories I have of our relationship. 

It has been two years since he was hit by the car. We have been married for 5 months, and he has only gotten worse. It used to be his happy/angry days were split about 50/50, but now they are more like 5/95. On our wedding day, he was his happy self all the way up to the end. We had been really struggling by this point, and I was terrified that he would ruin the day with a mood swing. But the wedding was beautiful and almost perfect, and the party was winding down. We sat outside until 3am with one of his old friends, drinking around a fire. I was begging him to come to bed with me and his friend was telling him to finish his wedding day like he was “supposed to”, but he kept refusing. When I finally got him to come in with me, he carried me inside, threw me down on the bed, and started screaming at me. I don’t even remember what he was so mad about anymore, but I was so caught off guard and scared that I just tore off my wedding dress and ran into the bathroom and cried. He stood outside the door crying and yelling at me, while I sat on the floor begging him to stop. My bridesmaid were all sleeping in the same house we were, and even though they have never mentioned it to this day, there’s no way they didn’t hear him. I was so incredibly embarrassed and sad that he would take such a beautiful, perfect day and completely stomp on it at the end. I finally crept out of the bathroom at 4am and cried myself to sleep. When we woke up in the morning he acted like nothing ever happened, and we still haven’t really talked about it. He knows how upset I am, but I’ve been too afraid to talk specifics. 

We had been trying to move out of the state for a long time, and various things kept holding us back. After the honeymoon his mood got worse than ever, to the point that I was seriously regretting getting married and ever even meeting him. We finally bought a house halfway across the country, and I was sure that living in a “vacation spot” would be the cure for both of us. It wasn’t. We have been here for two months, and he has gotten even worse. He is angry and pessimistic all the time, won’t talk to me, doesn’t even want to be in the same room as me. When he looks at me, it’s like he’s looking at something disgusting. He criticizes my every move, picks fights with me about everything, and throws tantrums like a 3 year old. Yesterday he didn’t speak to me the whole day just because I didn’t inform him that I was getting in the shower to rinse some chalk off my arms. We can’t go anywhere in public together without fighting, and we can’t choose anything to do at home together. Neither one of us has ever had many friends, and now that we have moved 2000 miles away from anyone we have ever known, that definitely doesn’t help. He has no hobbies or interests, and will do nothing all day unless we can miraculously decide on something to do together, which usually ends in tears anyway. 

I’m at a loss on what more I can do. My family and friends from home are begging me to divorce him. I gave in after 25 years of being staunchly anti-pharmaceutical and let the doctor prescribe me an antidepressant. I have been thinking a lot about suicide, and my sadness takes over my entire life. I have more panic attacks than ever and I rely on this sub to help me understand my mental health, since I can’t talk to my husband about it. I have tried researching new hobbies for him, buying him things, cooking food he likes, we tried yoga, exercise, fresh air, meditation, therapy, a new motorcycle, and obviously medication. But nothing has helped. All I want is to feel safe, loved, and respected. But we are so deep into this now that I’m not sure we can ever go back to the way we were in the beginning. So what do I do? Give up and divorce him, knowing that the old him is in there somewhere, and that a stranger pulled out in front of him and ruined our lives forever? Or just put up with this, dooming myself to a lifetime of being incredibly unhappy and resentful? 

I’m so sorry this is so long, and I truly don’t expect anyone to read the whole thing. It just feels good to get this off my chest and possibly have the chance of getting an answer. 

TL;DR: My husband was the happiest person on earth until he was hit by a car, and now he is incredibly emotionally abusive and angry towards me, and in denial that anything is wrong. We have tried medication, therapy, change in scenery, exercise, yoga, meditation, new hobbies, and countless others and nothing has helped. Do I stay with him and be miserable, knowing that his anger issues aren’t necessarily his fault, or do I divorce him so I can make myself happy?

Edit: the brain injury in question was a concussion. There was no anoxic brain death, and brain scans have revealed that there is no permanent damage. By all medical accounts he has made a full recovery, leading me to assume that there is something else going on. I was just hoping someone else has seen similar symptoms and could tell me something else to try, considering him refusing help, and doctors not paying much attention because they can’t “see” the problem. 

Edit 2: also just wanted to clarify that I’m not the only one his anger is directed at. Every single member of both our immediate families has individually pulled me aside to ask what’s going on with him and whether I’m in an unsafe situation. He has been called out by friends and strangers alike. And he has been labeled as insubordinate and hard to deal with at his job, which is really scary for our future. ",18Mar2018,9,

54,"Hi Reddit, I'm a 21-year-old female from the U.S. and am hoping for some insight into this negative cycle. I grew up in a chaotic family. As a child, I had feelings of depression and a general melancholy ""neutral"" mood most of the time. This has continued up until now but seems to have gotten worse. I recognize that I may have clinical depression and am planning to see a psychiatrist. Before I do that, I want to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong (or if my thoughts can be changed). No matter what I do or experience, I am always feeling bored and anticipating something else. I could be sitting at the pool with friends and I'll probably be the only one ready to go back inside even though I know I'll be even more bored at home. Today I went shopping with a friend and after a couple of hours, I was ready to leave even though I wasn't looking forward to doing anything else. Even when I'm having what others would consider a good time, I feel bored and discontent. This same principle has applied to bigger circumstances like life goals, jobs, relationships, etc. Each time I achieve something new, I am surprised at how little it affects my happiness. It's like my brain is waiting for some big ""moment"" when suddenly I am going to find happiness externally. I know this isn't the case and want to find happiness internally, but it seems like I am incapable of this. I meditate, exercise, eat well and spend time with loved ones. I keep my house clean and do my best to keep myself put together. Am I just depressed? Or is there something I'm just not seeing that I could change to find happiness?

**TL;DR** I've always experienced extreme melancholy and boredom, even when doing things others would consider enjoyable. I take care of myself, exercise, meditate, eat well, and spend time with others including my loving fiance. I'm not sure what more I could do to find internal happiness. I keep waiting for a moment when I will, but it hasn't come yet, and I'm beginning to worry it won't. Am I just depressed? Or is there something I'm just missing?",18Mar2018,5,

58,"So last night was the most difficult night of my life. It started when I was studying for my exams and taken 40 mg of vyvanse and half a caffeine pill. I’ve taken amphetamines/vyvanse before and things have gone smoothly. It is about 5 pm and everything is cool, and once it’s about 11:30, I don’t feel the vyvanse much and decide to take another 10 mg of adderall and another half a caffeine pill. Fyi, I am not prescribed anything. Everything seems fine until the end of the night, it’s about 6 am and I’ve smoked about 2.5 cigarettes so far. I knew I’d have trouble falling asleep, thus I decided to take 5 mg of melatonin. I’ve taken melatonin as well countless times in the past and never really had issues. Along with the melatonin I took three pulls off a oil (THC Oil) pen. I usually take this combo of the melatonin and THC after a day of amphetamine use in order to sleep and relax. However, by 7 am I couldn’t sleep at all. I don’t know what caused any of this and that is what I’m trying to figure out cause now I’m just extremely worried. I started feeling really weak all around my body, assuming it was due to the melatonin and being high, my chest felt heavy, shortage of breath, weakness in the arms, legs, and hands. I started having some type of tongue spasm or just an odd feeling around my jaw area as my tongue would feel weak or droopy or if I slept on my side, my teeth would close really tightly. My feet started to sweat and my hands/feet and whole body got really cold. My mind was literally racing, as I was having a different thought every second, it’s unexplainable. I just felt this entire feeling of dread and weakness. I was really sleepy but my mind kept racing and I would forget my previous thought quite instantly, and random things would pop into my head. Everyone I closed my eyes, I would somehow forget how to breathe and shoot back awake. I wasn’t able to sleep until 11:30 am. Mind you, I had only eaten half a sandwich for the entire day before I taken the initial vyvanse. Other than that I only drank water, Gatorade, and some Snapple throughout the night. 

Can someone please diagnose what I felt last night. I don’t want this to happen again and was the scariest thing I experienced. I literally felt like dying. It is the evening now as I’m writing this, I still feel extremely weak or limp and still having this some sort of disassociation type of state where it’s difficult concentrating on anything and my heart feeling like it’s racing slightly.
