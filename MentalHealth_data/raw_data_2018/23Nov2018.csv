These past few weeks, I've been having more intrusive thoughts, and feeling like I've been losing control over myself. It's... like there's another person in my mind trying to take over.

 Today was the closest it felt of that voice in my head taking control of me. I usually try to repeat some words or random thoughts to try and get rid of these thoughts/voices but it keeps coming back and I feel like it's getting worse... I don't feel like myself most of the time, and frankly, those intrusive thoughts are starting to scare me because I KNOW they're not my thoughts

Is this something I should worry about or is it all in my head and I'm just over reacting? Should I seek help?",23Nov2018,1
1,"Friends, family, myself and my old therapist have noticed symptoms of bipolar in me for a while now. I've only recently started to take steps to try and get help.

I started counselling with a new counsellor at Mind yesterday and as they can't diagnose, he told me to talk to my GP who would refer me to someone else. Today, I had booked in to start anti depressants. I told my GP everything and he said he doesn't know why I was told to come to him and that he would have referred me to Mind. 

I'm honestly just very confused and feeling like I'm getting chucked back and forth in the system when I need some answers so I can move on in my treatment. What am I supposed to do in the UK to be taken seriously?",23Nov2018,1
2,"This past few weeks, I have been very sad. Nothing has been enjoyable, everything in my life seemed bleak and upsetting. I did everything I could, I tried exercising more, but things havent changed. I have been messaging my discord groups constantly about how I feel like shit, and it's been happening way too often.

Right now I am on 60 mg Cymbalta, and 300 mg of Wellbutrin extended release. We have tried raising both in the past, but they made me feel very sedated. Throughout my life, I have switched between Zoloft, Lexapro, Abilify, Lorezapam, Buspirone, and Prozac. 

Things have not been getting better for me, and I really want to see my psychiatrist. But I think both of us are running out of options for medications, and I think I'm really frustrating him. Idk what to do",23Nov2018,1
3,"I just accidentally stumbled upon an old email from around 4 years ago that I sent to my ex partner. It through me back to where I was then for a brief second. It felt so much better then. I was a completely different person. I went out a lot, I was always doing something. I was social, happy, I had my partner who I loved. Everything was amazing and colourful.

It just dawned on me how unhappy and lonely I really am now. And how everything about me has changed. There's not even a remnant left. It makes me really sad and angry that I'm different now. Like my soul has left me. I'm just the dregs. 

It's the first time in a year that I've felt the need to self harm again, as well as properly suicidal feelings like before. I am safe, I know how to deal with these feelings now. But I just wanted to share with somebody how I felt. 

I think recently I've been going through the motions and not really sitting back and reflecting on myself and my environment. Distracting silence with videos or music so I didn't have time to let my mind think. And it suddenly feels like I woke up from that daze, it feels strange, and horrible. ",23Nov2018,1
4,"I (21f) always get an over whelming feeling of sadness and anxiety when I'm not around my boyfriend (24m) when I'm not with him I feel very sad and have the need to cry, nothing would be wrong the time spend together is always great, there would be no reason for me to be so upset but all I want to do is crying after I leave his place or vice versa.

I start to feel panicky and try to find ways to message him but I start to overthink becuase i don't want to come off as clingy and it gives me more anxiety and when I start to feel anxious I want to talk to him about it but then I like I'm bothering him or being annoying or clingy becuase we just spent time together. When we see eachother its always for a few days so I feel like I'm being over whelming or annoying or too clingy becuase I'm calling him crying becuase I'm having an anxiety attacks becuase I feel alone. I don't know if like its an separation anxiety or sometimes. I feel kind of feel lost when im not around him. I'm not close with my parents and my friends moved away for school and lost contact so he's the only one I can really talk to. So when he's not around I get very anxious. 

I want to be able to talk to him about it but I never I never know how to explain what im feeling and why.

Man this life is tough! it´s hard to keep up but i want to let a couple things out. There is definitely something wrong but i don´t know what.

Is this normal:

I have conversations with people i recently talked to. (when i'm alone)

they ask me questions and i answer them, about anything.

but when i am with these people i feel like, i don't have to talk about it ''because'' i already talked about it. and that's why no one knows about my conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

But what IF i tell them about my conversations, will they give up on me? will they stop trying to help me because i am ''crazy''? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not scared of death but i don't want to die, on the other side, i want to sleep for a **very** long time and not wake up.

&amp;#x200B;

I. Just don't know what to do. I don't want happiness. i just want to breath.

9,"Hi, I'm a 24 year old guy from Scotland and I thought it would be interesting to share how I identified and got rid of my depression. I hope I'm able to help a few people here as I think I have came across some brilliant info in the past few years that has changed my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember being extremely down all the time from the age of 12. This kept spiraling downwards until the age of 22 when I was unable to leave my own house and had trouble interacting with even my own family. I think I went as low as I could go and nearly jumped off a bridge one night when I was out drinking. This was a very dark time but I was always looking to cure this somehow, and for me it was either die or find the answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

At about the age of 21 I gave up on trying to be successful in life and pretty much devoted everything to find the answer. To be clear nothing is a holy grail and in many way it's a bunch of things working in tandem. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all I'd like to direct everyone to the work of Ross Rosenberg, writer of the book The Human Magnet Syndrome. This book introduces the relationship dynamic of the narcissist and the codependent. I'm willing to bet a lot of money that a most your parents are either a narc or a codependent. Right now, please look up and study this dynamic. Identifying this in your life is crucial.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I'd like to share something that astounded me when I learned about it and put it into practice. Now, this forum is called 'Mental Health', but the mind/brain is where you REGISTER that you feel bad or are depression. So where is the root of your depression? Where are these bad/unprocessed feelings CONTAINED? The answer is your body. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you ever complain of tightness in your neck/back, random aches and pains, or are even unaware of your body and the sensations going on, it is likely that you have a lot of trauma stored there. Again I suggest googling all of this and the experts can explain it better than me. Here's a couple of experts on releasing trauma: Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine 

&amp;#x200B;

This is rambling and badly put together but I'm just throwing some stuff out there that hopefully you will research and it will be of value. I also hope to open a discussion, please shoot me down or even ask me a question. 

Thank you

10,"So to start, please don't judge, I have no idea what's going on with me. Way back when Wreck-It-Ralph was released and I was younger, I liked the thought of it. That was until I got sick one time and couldn't fall asleep. The only thing on my mind was that movie. I wouldn't call it a nightmare because I had a fever and that was why I couldn't go to bed. I wasn't scared of this movie or anything so I just let it be. **Fast forward until now, when the sequel was released.** Once again, I liked the idea of the movie, but I outgrew it and didn't want to pay to see the movie. Everything was going fine until I saw that one of the games broke. For whatever reason my heart started going from about I don't really know, 60 or 70 bpm resting to about 90 to 100 bpm reseting. (Found this out with my watch) This time I could sleep but like the last time, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Obviously being the person who likes to solve their own problems, I googled it and found it could be an anxiety attack, (I've never had one so this freaked me out.) but this has been going on for a couple days now! Has anybody experienced this or know a way to stop this? Any help is appreciated! And of course, Happy Thanksgiving!",23Nov2018,1
11,"I've been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder since I was 14 and dealt with my fair share of depression and loneliness. But, deep down I think I'm just a bad person. I'm mean, generally negative, inflexible in my beliefs and my actions, and arrogant. Worst of all, I'm a hypocrite and never learn from my mistakes. I hurt everyone around me and am generally just a lazy leech.

I tried therapy more than a few times in the past, but it doesn't help. I've had more than a few bad experiences with the whole thing, so I don't see myself giving it another try anytime soon, even if I could afford it. I react badly to anti-depressants and they don't seem to fix me anyway.

I've tried my absolute hardest to fix myself, but nothing seems to help. I've been going to the gym as often as I can. I lost 30 pounds. I stopped drinking entirely. I've been eating healthier and dress better. I've been trying to become a better cook. I've been listening to as many different types of music as I can and reading more. I've been trying to question everything I know and believe and be more aware of why I do things. I got a job working with the elderly, just to try to learn something and become a better human being.

But nothing seems to make a difference. I'm still just a shitty person. I'm going to college in about a month, so I'll finally stop being such a burden on my family, but I hate to think I'll subject more people to me. I just don't know what to do.",23Nov2018,1
12,"This is a long and messed up story that’s got some language and possibly some other triggers in it. 

I’m [39M] having a hard time dealing with a lot of issues and I’ve struggled for a long time with anxiety, depression and social phobias. I’ve figured for a long time that there was something wrong with me, maybe I was a psychopath or a sociopath but nothing ever seemed to fit my symptoms. I recently discovered CPTSD and finally it all clicked. When I was young, my father was physically and emotionally abusive to me. I grew up not feeling like I was good enough for anyone and I suffered constant bullying at school. Somehow, I made it through and I left home and tried to never look back. I swore that I would never do that to anyone I loved. I, of course, failed.

My wife [42F] and I have been together for about 18 years. We’ve been married for 9. Leading up to the birth of my youngest child and after my wife’s personality changed and her attitude was terrible towards me. I was working a job that I hated and I worked long hours. We moved into a cycle of abuse that intimately ended with a domestic violence incident where I threw her to the ground. I had previously slapped her in the face about 14 years before and we had agreed that if it ever happened again that she would call the police. So, the police were called. I was angry because I had quit my job and moved to a place across the country and she had burned through my savings getting us there. I had told her that the only person in her family that it had benefited was her. I had no job, no friends and I was all alone. She wasn’t close to me and more and she wouldn’t talk to me. 

Ultimately, I found myself in probation and I’m just finishing up a batterers intervention class. I’m ashamed of the things I did to my wife, the woman I love and I feel like a failure. It a sense, it was a good thing that it happened because it opened up our communication together and I learned not to take the woman I love for granted and to never again use violence to try and get my way. I have a long way to go to regain her trust and I hope that I can do it one day.   I hurt her and I hate myself for doing it. 

So, we’ve overcome that situation and I’ve finally figured out why I’m the way I am emotionally. Then, today, a fucking bomb was dropped in my lap. Six years ago, around the time my wife’s attitude changed something terrible had happened to her. She had been raped. She never told me because she knew what I would have done to that person. She knows that I would have beaten him to death with my bare hands. I swear on my mother’s grave, I would have beaten his face in until the was nothing left but a smashed watermelon. This was a person I had allowed in my house, to watch my children. This man is my children’s grandfather, the man that raised my wife. The horror, the anger I feel right now is numbing me. This man almost destroyed my family because my wife couldn’t tell me. This man has the gall to look me in the eye and call me his son. I can’t ever go back home while he’s alive because I know what I’ll do to him. 

I feel like I’ve failed my wife on so many levels, I thought that my wife didn’t want to be with me because of my failings, that I wasn’t good enough and I was never bright enough to see what was staring me in the face. I didn’t know and I just can’t express the rage that is coursing through my mind.  I really don’t even have the words to express how guilty I feel. I already failed her. 

The good news is that my darker impulses have disappeared and I no longer feel like my family would be better off without me but I’m not sure I’m strong enough to hold myself together. My wife is the strongest person I know, I can’t comprehend the suffering she has endured. 

I had been seeking a counselor for my issues and I’m hoping that I can get better for myself and my family. I need to be strong for my family. I just hope I can do it because it’s so fucking hard. I don’t expect anyone to reply to me and this is just a burner account because I need to protect my wife and family. I just needed to get everything off my chest so I can be the rock that I need to be.

I have been wanting to do this for a while as I want to give my life meaning however have had little motivation and have been weighed down by the fact I am behind in my education. The pivotal moment that changed this thought into reality was the sobering moment when my friend sadly died the other day. It made death feel very real and made me want to do something with my life.

-constant overwhelming suicidal urges
-visions/hallucinations 
-drug use
-feeling worthless
-fear of the future
-feeling life is pointless 
-overpowering sorrow
-fear of socialising
-fear of crowds and people

I really want to kill something. I used to trap squirrels in my woods and then beat them with the blunt side of a hatchet, but I eventually made myself stop. I knew that if my parents found out or someone saw I would be in a padded room wearing a straightjacket so fucking fast. I loved doing it though, and I want to keep doing it. I realize that it’s fucked up and the squirrels were cute and all, but I still loved it. I loved everything about it. The way the squirrels jumped around the cage frantically when they saw me coming. The writhing and thrashing of them when I held them down. The feeling of the hatchet coming down on their head and hearing them squeak when it hit. I loved seeing the blood come out of their face and get on the hatchet and on the grass. I still remember the first time I did it. It was the beginning of summer vacation going into freshman year of highschool. I had been having a terrible few months for no reason whatsoever and had recently begun cutting myself. But no amount of cutting or burning or anything else for that matter had matched the pure bliss and total happiness I felt after I killed it. That was happiest I had been in months. But I want to keep doing it. I know that I’ve already said this, but I love it so fucking much. I know that what I’ve done is wrong and I realize that I shouldn’t do it anymore.

And I think being gay is mental illness, are men even supposed to engage in sexual activity with another man?

18,"Why should anyone ""keep on keeping on"" if the will to live has to be forcibly conjured every single day that forces itself upon them? Where does one draw the line when half of one's emotional and mental energy is used in the waking moments of every morning, and say ""enough is enough""? Can it be equivocated to being at a party or event that one never wanted to attend or even be invited to? One can just leave an event when the crowd becomes too unruly or it's worn them out so, but to leave ""life's party"" because it's been a dick for twenty-something years, it is still such a frowned upon act; so negatively viewed that before mental illness is even considered, the initial comments or questions are about how one could be so selfish. 
This one had enough about 10 years ago. Prompting oneself out of bed each day being one of the few things about which one is able to feel much pride anymore. After various  medications and the regular dosage increases, beyond workouts and beating a sand-filled punching bag bloody through professionally wrapped fists, what is one to do? 
If madness an emergency exit would self-termination be the stairwell behind that door? Are madness and suicide concordant or mutually exclusive? How would one even recognize their own madness? Is the first sign of ""losing it"" being unsure how or when this abysmal sadness even began? Or is that several signs into the process?
How does one prepare significant loves in one's life for an eventually such as a self inflicted, permanent peace? To try and explain that they weren't enough, but then nothing ever really would be, or would that even be advisable? How much comfort could that provide, after all?
How could an act like this even be justified when it is so condemned that speaking of thoughts of it can land one in a locked room, stripped down to a hybrid of an inmate jumpsuit and medical patient gown? 
Tired. So fucking tired. But not selfish, clearly. Fuck everyone who has uttered such an accusation.

I feel like an absolute parasite on society. 
I have depression, it can get pretty bad, and it's very exhausting. When my depression gives me a break I am usually hit by anxiety and a really terrible sense of dread. My depression I can deal with, but that bottomless feeling of dread is what I hate. 

I try hiding my mental illness, I try pretending I am ""all normal"", but when it's so bad I can't stay in a job, well then it's kind of hard to fake normality when people keep asking what I do for a living, or what my hobbies are - I have nothing. I am at a stage now where I am given a small ammount of money each month to pay for my living, and barely enough to cover bills and food - I am given this by the gov. On the promise that I go in theraphy to ""get well enough to work"". I know that will not happen. I say i want back to work but that is a lie. But if they feel I am being difficult then they can cut the support as ""motivation"" and well, then I'm SOL. What I get is already not enough, so I owe my family money, I owe my friends money, I owe debt collectors money - i keep having to take ""small loans"" because I can't make it go round, even if I save on everything. 

For the longest time I promised myself that I would let myself commit suicide as long as I had paid everyone back first. But now I see that the longer I live, the more I am just going to leech of others. I am going to the doc tomorrow because my physical health is getting bad. I am already ""chronically ill"" in the fact that I have celiac, so that is costing me more in food on average, but I might have something else as well, and I am not sure I can handle that. Not because being stuck in bed is bad, I already am most days, but because people will say that I should manage it fine, that I should be able to work even if I am sick, that I should stop being lazy, others are in work jusy fine, I just need more ""motivation"". I am terrified of saying that I am unable to work or to ask for disability - because if i get a no, then that is an actual death sentence. 

It doesn't help that the little family I have, hate the fact that disability even exist. That everyone who are not able to carry their own weight should just die already. My grandmother even said that you are either well enough to work, or so ill that life isn't worth living anyways, and then you are better off dead. I try and try to find positive things, to say it's not that bad, but I know I am bringing everyone down, and I know I am just a drain on society.

&amp;#x200B;

I have bad social skills and low self esteem, it hurts me when I go to class everyday and have no one to talk to, feels like I have no existence. Sometimes I would hold back my tears on public transit going home and cry due to the fact that I have let myself down.

Since the semester is coming to an end, I plan on withdrawing. But if I do so, I will end up disappointing my parents and ultimately myself. If I did drop out, it would feel like that time off would be a long time and it would be too late to go back to college. I already have taken 2 years off after high school to work a pizza place job, and I regret the time wasted doing nothing when I could've devoted that time to build character and to better myself.

We were forced to move  into housing commission in a terrible area, are completely broke and in debt as I can't work because I am her carer and I need to look after our kids. I do everything by myself because she can't go out. I can't do any real activities or hobbies etc because I am  always on call to  rush home to her if she has a panic attack, so I can't really commit to anything or go more than 30 mins from home. I have no friends anymore, I don't go out to dinner or anything, I attend all school functions etc by myself and haven't been on a holiday or even a night away in 8 years. If  I left her she would kill herself. Nobody understands what it's like.

I tried to go off of it by going from 2mg down to 1mg, and it was the worst pain in my life. Everything just seemed so dark and depressing, NOTHING felt good. Even going out to the bar with my friends and having a drink, I felt tremendously depressed and in pain.

My psychiatrist just said it was the depression coming back and not withdrawal.

Now I'm just wondering, will I ever be off this medication? How do you even get off of something like this?

34,"My (21) girlfriend (21) has mental health issues. She has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Their is also some pretty serious indications of BPD, and I have seen a lot of these symptoms in an astranged father and my sister. 

Heres the catch. Her issues stem directly from her relationship with her mom. Her mom has hounded her for years about how she isn't doing well enough. Even still in college, she checks on her grades constantly and chews on her if they aren't all A's . She constantly monitors her bank account. If she spends money on alcohol or going out her mom will call her and chew on her about it. This of course leads to her being absolutely numb about anything her mom says and rides her about... which is everything that should be important. but that is totally understandable.  

When she was a kid and dealing with things, if she tried to talk to her parents about her issues, they would roll there eyes and make her feel like her problems were insignificant and they didn't want to deal with them. So she learned that the only way to get them to take her problems seriously is to get absolutely enraged. She also of course has no emotional skin, as is common with all people with BPD which leads to issues with our relationship.

38,"Boyfriend and I were talking via phone call. Somehow he topic of death came up, and he mentioned his friend it's been almost a year since her suicide, he still wants to message her and tell her about his day (even if they haven't spoken in months), he remembers ""oh...yeah....that happened""

I said ""I'm not trying to invalidate your experiemce, but, I think that people have a more difficult time processing suicide than, say, a heart attack. I think it's because someone chose to end their life. And I think the fact that they chose, makes someone feel that they could have done *something* to keep it from happening--calling them, going over to their house. But sometimes...you cant""

""What makes you think that they can't do anything? You can always help someone and help them get better""

""At somepoint, they've run out of options. Out of ways to help. And at some point, they stop trying. They stop wanting to get better. So they do it, and they finally have peace.

There was silence foe a good 30 seconds or even 1 minute. Then he just screams *THAT'S SO FUCKED UP*

He continued : if you have problems, there's always a way to help cope, there is always people to turn to. You can cope with depression. If you end your problems with suicide, it's done--finished. Your problems are still there; you just are nothing and aren't there to deal with it. Do you think in the last few moments, you just think ""god I hope, this brings me peace""? *NO.* you freak out and think you don't want to do it, then NOTHING.""

He continued to say stuff like ""you can't think suicide is okay as an 'out' because it's not!""

We decided to put the conversation aside for now, allowing up to process our own feelings. 

But still, I stayed silent, tears in my eyes. I couldn't tell if it was anger or guilt that made me hurt. Was I angry at him for trying to refute my opinion? Or did I feel guilty for thinking something so immoral and awful, that I truly am fucked up?

I thought of my attempt 3 years ago, a half assed, lack luster one, and I tried to remember how I felt up to that moment. I was in college dorms--friendless, isolated; I was being emotionally used by my ex, whom I was still obsessed with; i was tired of tryong to get on with ""whatever it qas i was doing that i could call a life' 

I was hurt, sobbing to the point I couldn't breathe, my body was hurting from the self harm. I wanted out. I didn't want to be this awful forever.

That was 3 years ago. And since then I have gotten better quite a lot, but I still have periods where I feel it. Weeks at a time, sometimes. I consider it but I don't see it as my only option.

I'm not sure if it's because he's been exposed to death (suicide) and I have never been; I'm not sure if it's because of our different views of mental illness we've had throughout our lives. I'm not sure if it's me being over analytical ot brooding.

Am I really so fucked up for wanting someone who commits suicide to be released from their pain and want peace? Want an end to their hell? I don't feel like I am. At least I didnt. Now I question it...

45,"So let me preface this whole story with the fact that I am an Irish male in my 30’s. My experience with dealing with Mental Health growing up is a slap on the back and “Cheer Up” or “Ah shure it will be grand”. Typically Irish, and add the fact that Irish men don’t know how to talk about emotion and 
That said, things are starting to change in Irish culture and talk about mental health is much more open.
Now to my story, this is not about my mental health, it is about a collegue in work and I am looking for advice.
Some background, I live in a smalll town within commuting distance of Dublin. We both live close to the same train station and work in the same company, a large Electricity company. I meet this guy regularly on the train, or the walk to work, or in the office. We chat, we have coffee, we work in similar areas so have a lot to talk about.
In general this guy is very stressed. He gets wrapped up in work and “cares too much”. This means he is always striving for perfection but when others don’t meet his standards he gets frustrated.
Over the last few years he has been “Out Sick” a couple of time and in work this is mentioned as “Stress Related”. I was never really sure what that meant but could see how this guy could get so frustrated with everything that he would miss work.
Right now he is out sick again and I kept meaning to drop him a message to check up on him but in typical modern world fashion I didn’t. So on Wednesday morning I was off work bringing my kids to the doctor. After that appointment we all went to do some shopping and grab a coffee. I went for coffee while my wife went to Tesco. After getting the coffee I spotted this guy in the coffee shop reading the news paper. 
I went over before I realised what I was doing, I said hello and held my hand out to shake. This guy shook hands and held on for what I felt was too long. It is hard to describe but a handshake should be short but he held on. I asked how he was doing and he said “Ah I have got myself into a bit of a pickle”. I thought this was really strange as well. Looking at him I could see he has lost some weight and the best description I can come up with is he looked “Shook”.
I didn’t know how to react and all of my cultural teachings came to the front and I quickly changed the subject and in a total panic tried to get away as fast as possible. My wife came into the coffee shop looking for me and I introduced her to the guy, they shared hellos and we left.
Once we got out of the coffee shop I said to my wife, “X looks really bad, he looks shook”. Thankfully she knows me well enough that something was wrong. She made me go through the exchange I had and called out the long handshake and what he had said about getting himself into a pickle. As we did our shopping she insisted that I go back and ask if he wants to meet for a coffee and a chat at some stage. 
So that’s what I did. I went back in, apologised for not having time to talk now but would he like to meet for a chat at some point. He said he thought that would help. We are meeting tomorrow, Saturday, for a coffee.
Now to get to the point of this longwinded post. What I want is some help and advice. I am afraid of saying something insensitive or in some way making light of what he is going through because that is how Irish people deal with it. How do I approach the conversation? What should we talk about? Should I just listen? Should I be up front and tell him I am in uncharted waters?

Tl;dr?
I am meeting a collegue from work who has had a breakdown for coffee and I am looking for advice on how to talk to him without being insensitive and hopefully to be helpful.

Thanks for reading and any advice appreciated.

47,"Ever since I was a kid I would have these moments. They’ve always been rare. They never happened more then once ever few months. They were these weird moments where things always felt a little bit off. I’d get them randomly. I’d ALWAYS get them after pulling an all nighter. For years I could never describe the feeling. The closest I ever got to was the feeling you’d get after you woke up. That split second where you are just realizing where you are, who you are, and what your doing. You don’t usually realize it. But sometimes you do. 

About 4 months ago I was convinced to try marijuana for the first time. I was with a group of friends I’ve known since I was a kid, I was educated about marijuana and I knew exactly what I was doing. I wasn’t afraid. So I tried it. It was the craziest thing because that feeling I was never able to describe that I got every once in a while had just struck me. I ended up going home and sleeping it off. I figured it was just a one time thing. 

About a month later I decided to smoke again. This was the second time I’d ever smoke. I got that same feeling. The one I couldn’t explain. By this point it became clear that weed had the same effect on me as these moments. I didn’t like it. I don’t like these moments. So I made the decision to not smoke again. Ever again. 

But the feeling wouldn’t go away. I smoked that day early in the morning. I went home and played some video games. But it didn’t go away. After a few days the feeling started to became less active. I can’t explain it but it was as if it was getting less sever as time went on. I did some research and some people described it as a “burn out”. It was like the high wouldn’t go away for a while. I gave it time.

Eventually it went away. I was free. I felt normal again. But one day, randomly I got this moment again. Then the next day again. Now I’m at a point where I get these moments dozens of times a day. I’m losing my mind. I’m losing my sanity. After living this life like this for nearly 2 months now I’ve found the words to explain what I’m feeling.

At first everything will be normal. It doesn’t matter what I’m doing. I could be at home alone, I could be in school, I could be playing video games, I could be out with my friends. It doesn’t matter. Everything is just as it should be. But then there’s a single moment. It’s about a split second where you feel it hit you, and it hits hard. You close your eyes, then open them. Everything feels weird. Everything feels unfamiliar. It’s like I know everything around me and everyone. But at the same time it’s like I’m seeing the things and people I see everyday for the first time. 

Next is the really weird part. Right after the first part happens, you feel disconnected. You feel out of control. Your still involved in the conversation your having or the game your playing. Your still talking or playing. But it’s not you. You feel like your just watching everything go on from some sort of spectators seat.  That’s when you being to question EVERYTHING. 

You then remember your past. You remember who you are. You remember what’s going on and why you are where you are. It all hits you so fast. Then for a second your like... wait, this isn’t me. This doesn’t make sense. What’s happening. You feel disconnected. 

Things don’t go back to normal for a little while. It’s slow. I can’t explain how it happens, but over time I feel back to where I am... until it happens again.

I’ve began losing my mind and questioning even the most basic of things. Sometimes random things make me cringe. My heartbeat makes me cringe. The human body makes me cringe. Things don’t feel right. I then begin thinking of things on a more cosmic or grand scale. I begin thinking about the universe and how nothing we do is important as a species. One thought I’ve been having lately is how the human mind can’t grasp numbers. We can’t really ever understand the difference between 1 million and 1 billion. Then 1 billion and 1 trillion. We know there’s a huge gap and we know the numbers side to it. But can we truly grasp how big that gap is.

These thoughts are driving me crazy. I need help. But I have no where to go and no one to turn to. I don’t know what’s happening in my life anymore.

I began questioning myself to an extreme recently. That’s why I finally decided to do some research. I looked up some things about what I was feeling. That’s where I found some articles on Depersonalization Disorder. The minute I started reading the article everything clicked. Not like the way where you feel sort of sick but then look up your symptoms and jump to conclusions. Everything just fit here. I felt everything in there. 

I don’t know how long I can keep feeling like this before I straight up lose my mind. I’m not depressed. I don’t have anxiety problems. I just don’t know what to do. ",23Nov2018,1

These thoughts always involves some great harm happening to my loved ones and it always results in their death. Once I begin thinking, the only way I can break out of it is by touching anything made out of wood such as doors, windows, bed frame, etc. Usually, I would get these thoughts before I feel asleep so touching my wooden bed helped a lot in calming me down. Off late, I'm getting these negative thoughts while doing normal functions such as my work, watching TV, studying or even gaming. This causes me a lot of worry as I don't find myself near wooden objects and the only way I can break out of this thought cycle is by mentally saying ""forgive me oh lord!"" or by picking on my toe/finger nails or scratching any irregularities present on my skin or by biting on the skin on my lips. This has resulted in me having bleedy nails and lips as well as scars on my skin. However, I don't mind much as it helps me break out of these negative thoughts. The only other way I can insulate myself from these negative thoughts is by ignoring my surroundings and immersing myself in the activity I'm doing. But this has resulted in friction between my gf and other family members as they say I'm being very rude when I do this.

My parents are worried. I thought everything was fine, but now I am so stressed out and I cannot sleep. I want to turn to a vice, but I know that won't help. My family is full of addicts ( alchohol and cigarettes mainly). When I get home I deal with a foster cat, my cat, a dog, a fish, and a hedgehog. There is so much to do and my mother recently got a full time job so I am also doing more chores. 

How can I get unstuck. ",23Nov2018,1

51,"I reached the point in my life where I realized I need to get some help. I’m not suicidal, but I’m constantly feeling depressed to the point where it hinders my everyday life. I live in an asian family where mental health and depression have a negative stigma. I have tried to talk to my parents about my situation, but I was accused of how ungrateful I was for everything I had. I’m a student taking 6 AP classes, on the varsity volleyball team, volunteer weekly, in 6 extracurricular organizations and holding leadership positions in all of them, and in an orchestra. Despite all I do, I feel like a failure. I recently took the SATs and received a 1500, and my parents were very disappointed in me. I can’t talk to my school counselor either. I confided in her once, and she broke my trust. I just don’t know what to do.",23Nov2018,1
52,"So I guess I’ll start with stating the fact that I have a lot of mental problems (ADD, OCD, Depression). Thankfully, I only have mild cases, but it still makes it challenging to get through the day. I don’t find much enjoyment in anything anymore, I can never focus on anything, everything feels pointless, I feel super codependent, and I feel disconnected from everything. I really really want to be able to enjoy my life because I do have good friends, a good family, as well as a good school, but because of all these mental problems, all I want to do is sit in my room (the only place where I feel safe) and just quietly ponder life. I hate being in big groups but I always force myself to hang out in them hoping I’ll have fun (I rarely do). The only things that really make me happy are authentic conversations with someone.

55,"Hello

I hope that I'm not breaking any rules (written or unwritten) with this post and asking for help this way. I'll try to explain my situation, even though I fail at that even in my mother tongue. Generally I would say that it seems to be problem of having/not having a control of my life. I think. 

I feel like I can't enjoy life before I'm ""perfect"" and I have everything in check. This means that I try hold off any hobbies, movies, activities, relationships and what not, because I don't want to waste them now, when I feel incomplete. I have tendency to ""start over"" every day, every week, every month and every year. Sometimes I can enjoy life few weeks until I once again have messed up some things, acted weird somewhere and so on. Then begins my ""getting it all together period"". During those periods I try to make everything about my physical body as perfect as I can; I buy new journals and rewrite everything from previous journal into new journal; I delete old e-mails and chats everywhere; try to totally clean up every inch and space of my room and workplace. The idea is that I'll make everything perfect for ""date X"" and next morning I will wake up and my new life will begin. Until something happens (which might just be me forgetting to do push ups in the morning or mess up word in my journal), I feel like mess-up and make decision that ""i will start over tomorrow"". I understand that people have this with stuff like working out, studying and so on. I have it with my whole life. Every day.  


This problem is holding me back so much. I feel like I really haven't lived few 10-11 years. I'm 27 now. I'm married, I have pretty decent career and I'm valued at my workplace, but behind all that is what I described before.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope someone can give me any advice. I've been googling about my problems, but maybe my English is not good enough, so I haven't found anything specific for me. If you want, you can ask me more specific questions as I'm nor very good at describing my issues.

57,"Lately as the dark November period started happening again I had a few bad things happen in my life, and I'm also tapering off myself from Valium so that's always a constant struggle, then I had this INCREDIBLY vivid dream with this chick called Sally whom I've never met in real life but was nevertheless deeply in love with for a long, long time and I probably still am... 

The dream seemed to last for eternity and it was beautiful like I've always imagined meeting her like to be, so anyways, after I woke from it I felt like the most horrendous I ever had in months and my automatic impulse was: {KILL YOURSELF NOW} so I went outside and tried calling my drug dealer instead hoping to numb things out a bit but then it turned out he got arrested so that added to my overall sorrow even more.
 
I instinctively continued to go ahead and buy rope and sleeping pills after which I went home and tried searching for more drugs possibly lost somewhere in my bedroom and that was when I found my box of Seroquel 200s, which first I just threw aside but after failing to find any actual drugs I decided to pop a Seroquel hoping to sleep it all off and possibly not kill myself that day, and so I did, I was out like a light in 5 minutes after which I awoke the next day feeling smoothed out and finally rested both mentally and emotionally. 

I disposed of the rope and the sleeping pills and I've been feeling rather content since then, definitely not suicidal anymore over my delusions and overreactions of events. I've kept being on Seroquel afterwards and I'm completely fine and functional. Moral of the story? Just take your meds whenever things seem to go south. Thank you Seroquel. ",23Nov2018,1
58,"My (23M) parents got divorced and remarried a couple of years ago. I’m not on bad terms with either parent, and I’m still at uni until end of next year, so I’m still dependant on them.
For the first year, I lived with my mum, while my dad was alone. Then I moved into dad’s house, before he got married and had his new wife and step son (12M) move in also.
I feel like a burden in my dads new life, like I’m the leftovers of his old world that haven’t quite moved on yet. I feel guilty that I’m still here, and want to reduce/get rid of all my stuff so that I’m less in the way. I try really hard to keep everything i own in my moderate sized bedroom because i dont want to be the cause of any bother.

59,"So the last two years have not been friendly to me. I dont blame the social and political climate rather myself.  August of last year I was pretty heavily into cocaine usage. I didn't think I had a problem with it. However fate called me a fool when I picked up coke that was not what is was meant to be. Ended up snorting 5Grams of meth and went on a fucking grueling mental trip that I am still recovering from today. The mind does indeed play cruel tricks on you and who knows what will happen once it is put into a false state of fight or flight. I used to think people were weak when they complained of mental issues until I experienced the mindfucking experience myself. I have learned my lesson and have been sober for a year. Drugs and alcohol  included out of pure fear and disdain for what I experienced for not a night but a week after inhaling all that toxicity . As my parents and siblings coddled me treating me like an abnormality however . Maybe they were not so wrong in treating me this way. Yes I am seen as the retard in the family as this happened but now I am enlightened by the effect  of the human mind can have on the outlook and perceptions of values and goals. I was lucky that they bailed me out and provided love and understanding when I was literally at my most rock bottom. Now i want to pick up the pieces and prove to them that i am ready too be normal again . I LOST 2 YEARS OF MY LIFE. MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.  I dont know what I can do to pay my loved ones back . Maybe show them that I can thrive in this world rather than being the detriment. 

What I'm really asking is how can i find the motivation to better myself. Not just for myself but to make my family proud to step into my old self. Seeing the world as full in opportunity rather than the way I see it now (cautiously) and parnoially.  Where can I find this motivation amidst my anxiety and self loathing . ",23Nov2018,1

I find it difficult to help them understand because I dont fully understand. How can something have so much control over a person, it baffles me. I have been living with anxiety and depression for quite some time now, however its only been the past couple of months that i have been more aware of it. I completely lost myself and I couldn't even see, i blamed everyone else for my behaviour/irrational thoughts instead of facing the reality of things. I am currently seeking councilling and it has been a great help, i believed I was starting to feel like me again and getting my life back on track. I have now lost the belief. The past couple of weeks have been a right struggle for me and I can't pin my finger on what has triggered my anxiety and depression. I am a student and am on placement through my course. Recently I have been skipping placement, half arsing assessment. Walking about with a ""don't give a fuck"" attitude and it's having a massive impact on my life. I had a really bad anxiety attack last night and I couldn't get it under control, so many bad thoughts where going through my head and for the first time in my life I hurt myself. I felt like it was the only way to make the anxiety stop and it did stop, in that moment. As a result I skipped placement again today and i feel alot more depressed than I did. I live on my own and as great as it is, i spend most days pacing about the house trapped in my irrational thoughts and an anxious state, i can usually pull myself back. Last night, hurting myself scared me, what if next time I can't stop, it doesn't stop until my breath stops. The world moves so fast and sometimes I can't catch my breath, in that spilt moment hurting myself the world stopped, everything slowed down. I dont want to hurt myself to feel a relief from anxiety. I dont take any medication and I have never seeked medical help. I saw this page on here and have been reading some people's stories so I thought I would reach out to see if anyone had any advice or other coping mechanisms for anxiety attacks. I had/still kinda do have a problem with cannabis as I believe this ""helps"" me, when in reality I think it makes me worse.

65,"My psychiatrist thinks I'm not depressed but a schizophrenic of some form with anxiety. I don't understand my diagnosis.

When I was 16 I felt like I had energy throughout the day. The illness began, and I felt my mind become foggy, there was this special kind of darkness enveloping my mind. It started quickly. I became irritable towards everyone. The feeling made my thoughts race near-constantly. I couldn't get a grasp on what was happening in my mind.

I'm 23 now. I've tried multiple times to get back up, but the only thing that has helped me was sertraline, an SSRI antidepressant. Sadly, SSRIs no longer work for me, and it doesn't seem my psychiatrist wants to try them.

Every time I work on myself and my life, this strange mental fatigue comes on, and it won't leave me for days or weeks. Nothing helps it anymore.

The only thing I imagine could help my fatigue is something stimulating and rewarding, but I can't find anything like that. Everything feels like work.

69,"Hey

I'm 24, have depression, anxiety and aspergers syndrome. My weight is somewhere between 50 to 60 KG, and I'm about 180 CM tall. I also have low self-esteem, low confidence, no energy and motivation, but also really self aware. I'm not sure what weight and height can do with any of this, but may have something to do with this. Also, fighting off suicidal thoughts, feelings, and ideation.

I need help. My anxiety is through the roof because I'm scared to be alone, as I've been alone all my life (socially, emotionally and physically), feeling like I've fucked up with my closest friends, who I consider family, and cant/dont want to lose them, my sleeping pattern is screwing up again (getting around 5 - 6 hrs, instead of my usual 7 - 8), appetites not there/appetites going away, and feeling tired all the time.

A few weeks ago, went into a bad depressive slump, from fighting off and trying to put away bad memories from childhood, with a few of them being particularly bad as one has to do with having friends, a good chunk have to do with family. I'm trying to get out of this slump on my own, not asking for help.

I'm lost, confused and not sure what to do. Haven't had the greatest luck these last few months, had the threat of homelessness looming over my head, and it's still there. My family is useless, as well as being narcissists, with me not being one (to my knowledge), but have a disability (aspergers syndrome), and the ability to value and connect to people, with very few to connect too, emotionally. (I value my friendships and relationships with others more than anything). I have great difficulty to connect to others on an emotional level, but still try to connect.

I'm currently kicking myself metaphorically for not moving from sisters house a month or so ago, because I'm lazy and useless, apparently, but doesn't consider that there is another reason for it. If sister does kick me out, my mum isn't going to help (got myself into this mess, gotta get myself out. Mums mindset is ""you're an adult now, you don't need help, and don't ask for it""). Frustratingly, if I ask for help, on something I don't know how to do, both her and sister get annoyed and tell me to figure it (if you screw up, know for next time, but also expect me to ask on stuff I don't know...
They expect me to have every answer, know everything in the universe, and be able to know the future, but they also treat me like an idiot because of my aspergers. They also don't believe that I've got problems, even if it's completely obvious (don't have depression, don't have anxiety, don't have ptsd (self suspecting, but planning on having a diagnosis. Mum said I don't have it as the only way to get it is from war...).

I was diagnosed with PTSD from childhood abuse. I have stories of it somewhere on my Reddit. I have hallucinations of it. My brother raped me when I was 7 and he was 13 because my dad (different dad's, same mom) would abuse him and my brother would take it out on me since my dad's blood runs through me and my brother couldn't take on my dad. One trigger I have is raunchy dick smell, because it reminds me of when my brother forced me to blow him. As soon as the smell hits my nose, my mind sends me back in my bedroom with my brother back on my bed. It's like I'm there all over again. 

But that's not the part that baffles me. My mind sometimes goes into a forced hallucination where I'm getting hurt, like let's say I'm visualizing myself getting stabbed and my body almost feels it. I start to physically cringe and twitch and curl all around because it feels so vivid, like I'm actually getting hurt. I freeze and can not do anything except deal with this mental hell until. I work in a factory, and sometimes when I walk by a saw we have, i start having hallucinations of me walking over there and just cutting my hand off, and then my hand would physically throb almost like I actually did something and it just feels so god damn real. When I'm in bed, ever since I was a kid, I'll start seeing shit in the dark, and almost feel a presence just watching me laying in bed. I know it's not there, but my body goes into this fight or flight feeling and I'm just trembling and can't bring myself to look over the covers. The peak of this kind of stuff happened when I was 16, parents divorced, mom and brother were always gone and I was left in our 2 story home with no electric or water half the time because my mom used all the money to keep her failing business afloat. Hadn't spoke.to my dad in almost 8 years at that point, and I was all alone. In a big house with no light. I'd camp in the living room and I just couldn't sleep because I felt like someone was sitting by the stairs just watching me. My room had a wall that was just one big mirror, and mirrors scare the ever living shit out of me too.. 

I always think people are talking bad about me. Any time people look at me, I start to think all the things they could be negativity saying about me. And most of the time it has nothing to do with me, but I just automatically think it does. 

I've had so much shit happen to me because of my abuse from my family. My brain feels like it's malfunctioning and I just want to die because I don't think anyone takes it serious. which makes me think maybe I'm taking it too serious. My door and windows are covered because I get scared of someone or something sinister just watching me through the window. It's terrifying. All the hairs on my body stand tall. If the lights in the bathroom are off, sometimes I'll just feel like something is in there, hiding behind the door ready to attack or who knows what. I was also diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I have friends who have those and they don't seem nearly as bad, so idk what is wrong with me. I'm always exhausting because I'm always hyper alert and I wish I could just be normal.. 

I've had 2 suicide attempts which lead to an involuntary psych hold which got me my PTSD diagnosis. I just don't know if PTSD would do all that to someone?

74,"Hi, so this is a bit of a weird one. I tried googling for hours if I could find something at all related to this, but couldn't. I have diagnosed Bipolar (type II), and suffer from panic attacks sometimes.

However yesterday I had a really severe one after fighting with this specific friend. I felt like life was a dream I was going to snap out of at some point and I was crying and angry at this friend, and it was all very nightmarish - I felt extremely lonely and had a need to die or stop existing because life was hopeless, lonely and awful in that moment. I walked myself to the hospital, since I was scared, having never experienced this kind of 'unrealness'.   
Anyway, I'm alright now morning after I think and the hospital let me leave, but I feel really weird about the friend I was arguing with. I feel like they think of me as a stranger and that I don't really know them, and there's nothing between us to talk about despite having been best friends for 7 years straight and usually talking everyday. They did say some extremely hurtful and non-caring things to me, but I'd expect myself to be hurt, not weirdly disattached and hollow. Does anyone have any clue what's going on with me?

I will try to keep it brief; as honestly id like to type about 50 pages but no one would read a huge wall of text like this.

Im a month away from turning 23; and i have no job, no license and no knowledge/ability to drive CURRENTLY. The only job i have ever held was for about 3 months; and i ended up quitting eventually even though it was a pretty decently relaxed job for being a low position. For the past few years i have been isolating, and over time increasingly becoming more reclusive and anti-social. I live with my grandparents stiil; and i honestly avoid talking to or speaking to everyone, including family and past friends. I have a long history of mental health treatment since 13. As well as drug abuse/use and treatment, various substances, usually heavy binges followed by long long breaks depending on circumstances.

I went to college and had to leave one class dry of my degree due to financial reasons; now im in an incredible amount of debt from college and similar and have nothing to show for it. I become more and more reclusive as time goes on. I have always had a very hard time dealing socially, and am not a people person even if i try hard.

So basically what im asking is advice regarding how to move forward in life? For me it isnt so simple as people say. Although most of it is my fault; Its hard relating to people, or facing anyone socially because i feelt the guilt and shame of being nearly 23 without a job, purpose, function or anything. A big issue also is i have no motivation to succeed, im not suicidal but i have no urge to live; due to a long long time living without anyone to talk to or give good advice; and the fact that even if i work whats the point i have nothing to gain out of it except possible survival/necessity. I still wouldnt have friends; or a motivation to do better in life. just surviviving or doing it for the sole purpose of being able to support myself; is morbid because it wont improve anything for me.

There is alot more to this regarding damage from psychiatric meds forced to take; and other things. But im looking for some opinions or advice; hoping from people who have similar experiences (if there is anyone... i feel like the only one so unsuccesful and worthless).

82,"A close family member is in a bad relationship and has been for months now. They are constantly fighting almost breaking up. His significant other is manipulative and gets angry over the simple things (tells him she never wants to see him again). This family member however is almost obsessed with the relationship despite how bad it is. No matter what happens he can’t stop talking to the person. He obsesses over her when she don’t talk to him, feels hopeless if they aren’t together. He gets extremely depressed when they aren’t talking, we feel like we no longer know him. No matter what we say he just doesn’t listen, he only wants to hear whatever he wants us to say.

This is starting to affect his functionality and everyday life. He can’t focus at work, wants to leave in the middle of the day just to speak to her. He’ll call family members to talk about it during the work day. When he’s at home the only thing he wants to speak about is the relationship. He can’t deal if they aren’t together. We’ve told him multiple times that they need to break up, the the relationship is toxic, that he needs help. He’s gone to therapy once or twice but hasn’t stuck with it.

83,"Hello, 

I am a 25-year-old in the UK and am unsure who to ask for advice about my mental health. I tend to go through periods of what I think is depression about 4 times a year, with each ""episode"" lasting anywhere between a week and a month. I also have a proclivity for talking to myself out loud. This happens as, in my mind, I am talking to someone who I may feel close to at that time and we will rehearse an imaginary conversation, or I may even repeat previous conversations we have had. 

More often than not, I will get so into the conversation I will start talking out loud as if they were right in front of me. I have also caught myself making exaggerated motions with my hands and making facial expressions/laughing out loud. I don't particularly mind this happening, but it is sometimes noticed by people around me who ask why I'm making weird faces/laughing or they may ask what I said. This will also be noticed by people walking in the street and has even been mentioned by some family members. On a typical day, I will have a conversation a dozen times an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Both the depression and the conversations have been going on since I was 11-12. Are they potentially related? Should I seek help from my GP?

I had a very bright relationship with a guy. It lasted exactly a year. Then we broke up as I found out he was cheating and had a parallel story for more than 9 months. 

Time passed but I still think about it all the time.  I don’t understand his behavior at all and that is why I am asking here. 

He was taking these pills  (Venlafaxine Effexor xr 150 and tricticum ac 150 ) but he never told me what type of diagnosis he had. He told that he had depression and anxiety.

85,"I apologize if this isn’t the right place to post this, but I’m looking for some advice here.

For the last 2.5 years, my mother has been in a severe depression. Not entirely sure what brought it on, and she shares very little with us, but it’s the reality of the situation. She used to take a few different medications but has refused to take them in the last two years. She has refused to listen to any advice we try to give her, refuses to seek any sort of help. We’ve pleaded with her to just go see her regular doctor and get checked out. We’ve pleaded with her to talk to a counselor. She has an extremely antiquated opinion of the mental health system because she thinks she’s going to be “locked up” (her words) in an asylum like the old days and will never be free again. No matter how much we try to tell her otherwise, she won’t listen. She has refused to speak to any of her siblings no matter how much they call, text, send cards, etc. She is ashamed of the way she is and doesn’t want to have to deal with telling them anything.

I’m 25 and live at home with her and my Dad, because I can’t bring myself to leave her like this even though I have a well-paying job. I have two adult siblings as well who both live out of town currently, but who come home as often as they can and try to help in whatever ways they are able. 

Recently, someone called APS because they’re worried about not having seen or spoken with her in over two years and are worried something is wrong. I don’t know who did, but a social worker came to our house while I was at work. My mom didn’t answer the door and when I got home, I found the card the social worker had left in our door. The following day my mom called APS back and she did agree to let the social worker come out to our house and speak with her, but only because she knows it would be worse to keep ignoring them. The social worker will be here on Monday morning. I will be at work, as will my Dad, so it will just be Mom at home. I have no idea what to expect out of this visit. My mom just keeps repeating “they’re gonna lock me up.” I just want to know realistically what I might be able to expect. It’s clear from her personal appearance that she isn’t taking proper care of herself, but that’s been her choice. There’s always plenty of food, supplies, there is a car and keys at home during the day if she wants to go anywhere, she has clothes, a good house, etc. She isn’t being neglected by us in any way, she just chooses not to do those things for herself. 

Anyone who deals in these sort of matters, if you could give me any insight here I would greatly appreciate it. And if you want any more information, just ask or DM me. Thank you!",23Nov2018,1
86,"Hello all,
I recently went through a terrible break up (which lasted ironically less that 5 days). I was/is dating my boss at the time. In the process of moving, I lost my medication. I’m bipolar and schizophrenic. 


Without my meds I can’t sleep and make poor decisions. And that’s exactly what happened. I literally have no one in my life to talk to so I turned to my coworkers. By no means did I talk shot (bc my boyfriend is honestly a wonderful person). But I did talk about the breakup way too much. My coworkers turned on me and thought I was trying to get him fired. No one there would talk to me anymore and everyone was telling him they felt bad for him bc he had dated such a horrible person. I was taken into my managers office and chewed up more than I’ve ever been in my whole life.



I’m aware that everyone hates me due to this and I have only myself to blame. I just wish they knew me better, understood that the lack of meds made me behave erratically rather than me being some kind of horrible vindictive monster. But I take total responsibility for it. I ended up running out of work sobbing and quitting and everyone there who once cared about me talks shit, tells my bf he deserves better, he has female coworkers trying to fuck him, ones who are skinnier and prettier than me, and most of all normal.



I’ve since found my meds and are stable again, but I’m having a terrible time coping with everyone who used to like me hating me. I wish they understood. All I can do at this point is work on myself and get better, but I’m racked with guilt all the time.



I know I come off as some kind of monster here. I used to be normal. I didn’t have mood swings or hear voices. I was a good, rational person. How can I live with myself? ",23Nov2018,1

88,"So, little back story. when I was a freshman in high school I didcided I'd join our towns high school rugby team. Half way through the season before suffering a severe brain injury (diffuse axonal). It was a complete fluke injury, the other guy did not  intentionally try to hurt me. I ended in the ICU for 9 days. I was in a coma for three days of the 9. The doctors had told my family I could be unconscious for a month or longer and that I would most likely need some level of care afterwards. 

I ended up waking up after 3 days much to the shock and joy of my family and the doctors. It had looked like I had suffered a stroke, i had issues speaking and doing any thing even at a close to normal speed. After the 9 days in the ICU i was released and sent to a rehab hospital for speech, occupational and speech therapy. Again I blew the expectations put of the water and was released of inpatient therapy. Only thing was left was out patient physical therapy. 

Everyone kept telling me how lucky and blessed i was to have recovered as I had with no real cognitive problems. I never thought of it that way growing up. I hated the fact my life had to change as much as it did, if I was so blessed why would this happen. I couldn't play any of the sports I'd played growing up loving. I suffered from constant head aches and migraines, I couldn't do anything for more than an hour or two before having to sleep. I started having issues with anger management and suicidal ideation. I would sit in front of the gun safe in the basement just staring at it contemplating taking one of them and going into the yard and ending it. The one thing that always brought me back was that I couldn't put my family through something like that to them.

So I muddled my way through life for the next 9 years of my life. Passed through high school with good grades but had stopped really caring about it. Became a chronic smoker of weed, it was the only way the head aches would stop and the best way I'd found to numb myself to everything. I tried to go to college, failing out from spending the whole time partying and smoking. 

Came home and got a job in town. Started smoking and drinking even more. I was always high all the time and had no energy to change or do anything. I had tried to hide from the depression and anger and the feeling of being worthless. It hit a point where I couldn't take it anymore the depression had grown so bad that the thoughts of killing myself were constant, they had grown it's own identity in the back of my head. I acknowledged the fact that I didn't want to follow through with it but that voice was always there, always pushing. 

I went to my mom and admitted all the thoughts and hatred I had for myself. She was shocked, I had been able to hide it well enough that her and my dad didnt suspect it was that bad. They helped get me into a mental health program to help teach me coping skills and to help get me on a the right medication and to set me up with a therapist and a psychiatrist. I learned that from the head injury it had screwed up the chemical levels in my head resulting in the depression and anger issues.

It's been a year now since I had done that. I feel great and have grown closer with all of my family. They've been the best support group I could have asked for. I've gotten a membership at the local climbing gym, started eating regularly and have really started to reach out and start making new friends and have discovered my love of traveling.

Basically I'm throwing this out here for those that are struggling that there are people and programs out there to help. The biggest step can be admitting that it's not something that you can do it on your own. There's people and programs out there that will gladly help you.

If any of you need someone to talk to you can always dm me!

To be honest, her breaking up with me was one of the reasons why I started my talk therapy. I can say that i have some problems with self esteem and deep relationships and I'm currently working on it with my Therapist.

First months after she left were terrible for me. Now when it is finally better she decided to cantact me. Said something like she wishes that im happy, she loves me like mother loves her son, she is happy that she finally contacted with me, she is pissed at herself that she did not fight for our relationship.

For all this time I thought that this breakup was piece of cake for her and i should be happy with her saying all of these things but im not. I hate her. I feel like im being used again as an emotional tampon just to make her feel better, i hate her loving me like im her son. Ok, I know that im not brave enough to be perceived as man, but her saying something like this only makes it worse. 

Finally I had courage to say: ""This conversation is not good for both of us so see you tomorrow"". Yeah, tomorrow because we have some business to finish. I hope this is last time I will ever met her. At least I will have something to talk about with my therapist.

93,"I have to admit to a serious personal issue. For the last 6 years, I've been in a branding-identity crisis. I want singular consistency - the ability to share myself in one stream without having to fear for my privacy or the consequences of consolidating my expression. I use various internet disguises, handles, separate accounts, multiple Facebook profiles, and so on in order to feel comfortable expressing myself.

However, life is getting more complicated, the apps and accounts are piling up, and I'm losing sense of consistency. Out of panic, I delete my social media accounts, change my usernames nearly every week, and sit here feeling a total lack of motivation as a result of my inconsistency.

People don't trust me because they can't trust me. I can't trust myself. As soon as I come up with a good idea for a username, I lose interest. Why can't I just use my real name?

Why can't I just me me? Use my real name, own my expression, and hope I don't lose everything. I fear sharing all of my in a single stream will lead to lost employment opportunities, lost social reputation, and even loss of freedoms if that damn Chinese social credit system ever reaches the USA.

I want to share all of myself. I want to use my real name, and I'm not proud of it. I feel like my name is unoriginal and at best infamous. I've worn out my welcome, and people can't trust me online because I'm constantly changing and disappearing.

I know the solution is to be consistent. Just pick something and go with it. Sometimes, I do. And it's those sometimes that make me feel like I should trust my gut. Right now, going with my real name is hard. twitter.com/myname is already taken. twitter.com/mynameOrg isn't taken, and that's my website: myname.org. But that looks boring... too professional... yawn.

How about twitter.com/TheRealMyName? Sounds egotistical.

I can't choose, and I'm sick of being irrelevant. I want consistency so people will respect me and see my expression. I'm a writer, a visual artist, a musician, a comedian... but I am none of those things if people aren't exposed to my brand.

94,"I struggle with depression, anxiety, and C-PTSD. I've found that Instagram, Twitter, and even Facebook tend to make my mental illness much worse. I've noticed this trend and have tracked it, so there's no denying it's the case. Social media sites that aren't anonymous, where you have to post a profile photo and a cover photo and write a bio, really give me a lot of excessive negative feelings/rumination. So, the obvious solution would be to delete or not use these accounts anymore and to only stick to social media forums that don't make me feel this way (Reddit, Pinterest). 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, I'm sort of terrified of not having social media. I feel like I'll be missing out somehow or won't be able to showcase my life (this part is definitely ego-driven) or share important memories with others. This is especially prevalent because I'm a singer and am afraid of not using social media to promote my work (though I could technically still use YouTube for this). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid that without social media, I won't be able to keep up with everyone else in the modern world; that I'll sort of fade into non-existence in a way. But I also don't want my mental issues to keep flaring up because of social media either.

95,"First off, I know that that immediately sets off warning bells, but I'm not going to kill myself and I know I can google the suicide prevention line, but it won't ever get that far, because I'm not going to kill myself. I've tried two times in the past, once when I was a teenager and once back in 2012, but it wasn't until the second time that I really appreciated how devastating it would be for my family, so it's completely off the table for me.

In a way I think that's part of the reason why I'm having so much trouble; I want so desperately to be dead so I don't have to deal with anything any more, but I can't do it myself, so I'm just kind of stuck existing day to day and hoping that I get diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer or something so I can have a quick out without the guilt of actively pursuing death.

I've thought about it over the past few weeks and I think the root of my problem is that I don't see any value in my life. Just about every positive step I could take (stop drinking, exercise, eat better, etc.) I feel like what's the point, ""it's just me"", i.e. I'm not worth the effort. I don't feel like I contribute anything to the world. I'm in a dead-end job that's essentially slapping a keyboard like a monkey for eight hours a day and being chastised whenever I try to go above and beyond and suggest ways to do tasks more efficiently. I've found out that all the coworkers who I thought at least respected me have been talking shit about me behind my back for months now and have been actively trying to get me written up for inconsequential stuff even though I'm the most productive member of the team and have never said an unkind word to any of them (I keep to myself, that's all). I don't have a romantic relationship; four years of dating apps and websites (I live in a pretty rural area) haven't resulted in anything lasting more than a month, so I've just thrown in the towel and accepted that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life (not to sound rude, but but if I hear ""plenty of fish in the sea"" one more time I'm probably going to vomit). My friends are all online, and while they're great, the only thing I can offer them is to make them laugh. I have a wonderfully supportive family without whom I would have been dead years ago, but I'm terrible at showing appreciation and feel like I can't tell them how I feel because it'll worry them. I tried to take a philanthropic approach to life, i.e. become happy by making other people happy, so I started making baked goods for the nurses at my job, I clean off everybody's cars when it snows during the day, etc. Even the genuine thank yous and appreciation don't make a difference, and even create more ire for my department's coworkers because ""Oh, you haven't made **US** cupcakes in the last six months, how come? You must not like us.""

I'm essentially not enjoying life at all but am just miserably staying alive for the sake of my family. I've tried depression meds to no effect. I'm too poor to go into therapy, and I haven't tried any sort of non-medicinal self-betterment tactics because deep down I can't shake the feeling that I just don't matter. I'm an inconsequential blip in human history/the universe and not worth any effort it would take to feel happy. I feel trapped. I want so desperately to just be dead and get it over with but I can't kill myself. I don't even know what the purpose of this is, honestly. It's not a pity-party fishing for compliments and soothing cooing, I hate it when people do that. I'm just at my wit's end. The only thing that makes me happy any more is drinking, and even that's lost its luster over the past few weeks. I just don't know what to do.",23Nov2018,1

About a year ago I got back on them, and I went from feeling on top of the world to the worst I’ve ever felt. I began going through periods of thinking of suicide, and not leaving bed for days. To periods of feeling more motivated then ever, having much more energy, and becoming more reckless. Only to fall back in to depression, and rinse and repeat.

So here are some things I left out because I thought they were kinda irrelevant:


My ideologies made me more antisocial, whenever my classmates were talking about politics, I didn't want to sound like a nazi, so I kept my mouth shut, whenever they talked about music, I only thought of far-right bands, so I kept my mouth shut. I wasn't up to conversation at all. When you don't feel accepted, you'll marginalize yourself and you'll end up being miserable. Every human interaction I have feels so ""conditional"", For example, if I get into a relationship or make a new friend, the first thing that comes to mind is: ""only if he knew about my ideologies"", It feels like those few friendships I have are all hanging from a thread. And if you are wondering why I don't just have friends with the same beliefs as mine, well It's because I live in a small town and I've never met a person with similar beliefs irl, I'm also too young to move out yet so I just have to cope with it.


I myself can't decide which came first, was I antisocial and that turned me into a white nationalist? or was I a white nationalist and that made me antisocial?

Previously I used to get tensed about the exam and study at least a day before. But now, nothing is affecting me. I don't care at all. Failing this exam will be a huge loss for me. Its not that I don't want to study. I want to study, but I can't help it. Also I'm sleeping for 10-12 hours a day and still feel drowsy, tired all the day .

105,"I have been starting to feel like crying all the time and at random places. There are reasons for that and recent events. If I am not staring at a screen, a river of thoughts go through my head that are sad. Everytime I read an article that mentions years, I think about how fast years pass and how we will all eventually die, how my family will die, my mother will die. How I am very far from them. I feel extremely homesick. Things that didn't bother me before, bother me now, like my parents getting divorce. It feels like there is so much unaddressed crap and someone left the door open to that part of my brain and everything is falling out hitting me in the face. I am not sure how to make it stop....

106,"First of all, my mental background. I am 22, depressed since I was six years old, I have anxiety since my teens, and just the last months I discovered I have ADHD. My boyfriend is the first person I've ever dated, we've been together for one year and one month, but only recently he has been bothered by my mental illnesses.

He insists that he wants to date a person with confidence, not a self-concious person; a cheerful person, not a depressed person; a chill person, not an anxious person. He says that I don't have friends because I don't want, that I am making up my depression and my anxiety, and he thinks that from one second to another I can become a different person if I want.

I told him that he has known from the beginning that I wasn't neurotypical, and he said yeah but I hoped you would get over it eventually, and that he might get bored of me if I don't change.

Everybody is telling me to dump him before he dumps me, but I love him, he is the most important person in my life, the only one who supports me even if during these last months he hasn't been very empathetic.

I have explained to him how depression and anxiety works but he stills thinks it's nonsense. He wants me to make friend , which I understand because since we are in a LDR I feel very lonely, but I can't just go outside and ask people to be my friends.

107,"I have a homophobic and somewhat racist dad, and a judgemental mother. I don't feel comfortable around them at most times and I feel like a burden to my family. And a disappointment. I'm yelled at almost constantly everyday to the point it's just second nature.  They've been forceful about their religion on me in the past and still do when it's brought up. They shamed me when I said I was confused and didn't know what my belief was. They even marked me as Roman Catholic on my therapy papers against my own will when I said I was most likely agnostic. Right in front of me. My mom even removed herself from the question that asked ""Who is causing you the most problems"" because she thought it was ugly when I was being honest. Now I've converted to Christianity, which they'll be disappointed about when I tell them I am. They're hardcore Catholics. 

I've been concealing a lot from them. What I'm going through, my sexuality, talking to online friends, etc. I've been paranoid of them and what they'll think of me when I finally ""come out"". 

I've had a lot of existential crisis, and have contemplated on not existing anymore or just to never have come into the picture anyways. At home, I feel so bored and uninterested. A waste of space and just to be commanded to do whatever my parents say. I feel no genuine connection to my parents and I feel like a stranger in my own home. I've never talked to my parents about my mental obstacles because they'll just think I'm being dramatic or lying just to get attention or something like that. My dad has even compared his pain to mine at one point where he almost committed suicide because of his acne, after he got annoyed with my venting. 
I've never told them I was suicidal because I didn't want to seem like a freak to them or my family and they'll just be worried and put me in a mental hospital or something. I've only told close friends and they all understood me. Even since, I've never talked to my parents about my problems because I know how they would react. 

The one weird thing wrong with me is being afraid of summer. Last summer vacation was actual Hell. I was yelled at, argued with, saw my uncle dying and seeing his corpse in the casket days later, and then the big event. My dad caused a scene at a mall on my mother's birthday shortly after my uncle died (on the same week) because he saw two women holding hands. He made her cry and played victim ( he thinks no one ever listens to his opinions) and told me to shut up when I tried defending her. She then scolded at me for the way I talked to him during that fiasco. Summer is the worst time because I'm around them more. I don't feel comfortable or trust my own parents. If I feel the heat, hear anything summer related, have anyone ask how my summer was, or anything like that, I get so anxious and have flashbacks. Can't even hear the word summer without getting into a depressed mood or get on edge. My heart starts racing and I feel a nasty dread in my stomach. It's bad. Really bad. I didn't tell my parents that because they'll think I'm being dramatic and not take me seriously. 

Along with summer, Sundays are another thing I don't fancy. I get the same reactions. I start getting nightmares and get into a hostile mood because those days are the days my mom will tell at me the most. I'm also constantly paranoid. Another reason, is because the cycle will replay. I go to school and come back to yelling of some sort and boredom with the feeling of being a burden. Everyday. It haunts me. And this has been going one forever. 

School is the only place I feel importance, purpose and I feel respected by teachers and peers and friends. It's also the only time I ever get to see friends (it's a rarity for my parents to let me go hang out with them. I've only hung out once in my life with friends) . I'm actually ""schoolsick"" and wish to go back already, but I'm also afraid of the cycle. 

I was in therapy, but they stopped taking me to dodge the family therapy offer. I tried convincing them into getting family therapy for all of us to work together and find common ground. My mom said no because I was the only one with a problem and that they're fine. I felt hurt by that. 
I felt alone and hopeless. More than I am now. 
And they would insult my therapist behind her back and say she never helped with anything. Oh, and they said I only got worse from therapy. 

The day before Thanksgiving this week, I almost killed myself by putting myself to permanent sleep with pills. Before I could think of going to the medicine cabinet, something in my mind told me ""no"" And I went to take a shower instead (I actually needed to take one). I cried in the shower so no one could see me weak. After that, I called the suicide hotline and things kind of toned down. I went into chat mode because I didn't want to let my parents hear me. The person said he was gonna wrap it up and spoke in small sentences. 

I know I'm not helping myself by not telling my parents what's wrong with me, but from all I've experienced with them, it makes me not want to. I don't have an explanation on why I get freaked out by summer, but it's pretty bad. 

I'm just glad I'm alive and called the hotline, so I tried something in the best of my ability to prevent anything drastic happening. I've talked to my friends about it and only one family member I trust (not the suicide part because she'll easily tell my mom) I'm trying. I'm trying to get through this  hell. ",23Nov2018,1

109,So about 4 months ago I started taking Wellbutrin. After 2 months of the treatment all it did for me was make me really dizzy and cognitively impaired. I waited another month then my psychiatrist decided to give me an SSRI. After about a week and half of the SSRI I am starting to feel really dizzy again. Very similar to how I felt from the Wellbutrin. I have the symptoms of depression except mood swings and it seems my psychiatrist really wants to believe it is depression when it doesn’t have to be.

I've been going with a psychologist since I was 12 years old (I'm 22 now) but to be honest I haven't kept it regular per se in the last 3 years. I have depression and anxiety and I'm afraid it could be something far worse. 

Tomorrow it's my first appointment with a psychiatrist and I'm pretty anxious about it because I know it might involve meds or something and I know it sounds silly due to the fact this is not my first time in therapy but, i feel like for the first time in years I will be facing all of my issues.

113,"I just need to vent...or just get this out. Whatever.  


I have been searching for this certain Norwegian film (2016 Toronto International Film Festival) for weeks. The name of it is Pyromanen...literally Arsonist in English. He is a pyromaniac, just like myself, who is pretty much ignored and shunned by his village so he burns abandoned houses and his fires get bigger and scarier. His first fire of the film is a brush fire. Since he is the Fire Chief's son, he goes with his dad to all the fires in the village as a firefighter. They have no idea who is starting these fires at first, but it becomes so obvious later in the film. There are many many fires set, each after Dag has been rejected or disrespected (it seems) by the rest of the village.   


One of the last scenes shows his mom (who he is very close to) going out in back of their house, stepping over a stone wall...and then it shows her slowly walking forward. You don't see what she is looking at until the camera changes angles and you see Dag lighting a barn on fire. She catches him red-handed, and the camera zooms in to his face. His eyes are full of tears and he looks absolutely helpless and hopeless. He knows he has been caught, but he is helpless to deny what he is. He knows what he is. His mom tells his dad (remember he is the Fire Chief), who goes to the police.  


The last fire scene shows a house fully engulfed and Dag arriving to find an old man and woman standing outside their burning house, clearly upset. He had been the cause of that--the first scene had been this couple fleeing their house, which had been purposely set on fire by someone you couldn't see. The woman goes back into the house to get a box, and gets trapped by the flames, which now have cut off her escape down the steps. It shows her facing the flames, but then the scene switches and it is 3 weeks prior, and that is when the story of Dag is told...leading up to that last fire scene. It is then when he realizes that he is out of control and he almost hurt someone. He had been only burning abandoned properties, but this time, there were people involved and that really got to him. (Side note: that is why I would never torch a house myself...)  


The story ends with him in the police station and it kind of hints that the police chief had already figured it out anyhow (Dag had left the cap to his gas can at a fire scene, though he had denied it and tried to explain it away) even before his parents had told him that it is Dag who is the pyromaniac on the loose. Dag confesses, sort of. He tells the police chief that he shouldn't let the detectives take the credit for figuring it out becauses he (the police chief) had already solved it himself. The police chief asks what Dag means by that, and Dag just sits back and has this evil smile on his face. He knows he has been caught. Then the scene switches to his parents going to a store...and I didn't get that part, but whatever. His mom walks away from the car and the film ends. Very confusing ending...  


  
I know the actor is just playing a role, but something in his acting really hits home with this character. He plays the part pretty damn genuinely from the expressions on his face when he is thinking about lighting a fire (I don't know if the average person would pick up on this, but I sure did) to his relief and pleasure (and then the hopelessness he feels after the fire has been lit and he realizes what he has done)...these are depicted and portrayed really well.   


I don't know why I am writing this. I feel a real sadness after watching this movie. I wouldn't dare burn a structure (came close but I couldn't do it) but I so understand what this movie is about. In a way, I am jealous and envious of the big fires he is able to create when I am stuck with newspapers and my wooden pallets still...and an odd dumpster fire here and there. I know I shouldn't envy that which is very illegal to do...but I simply can't help it. I can't help what I am either, and I empathize with the hoplessness I sometimes feel because of that.  


I guess there is no point to this. I will be talking about this in therapy for sure...I just wanted to share this film with y'all since it is VERY hard to find.  


I am Dag. Dag is me...I am a pyromaniac. I can't deny it. I can't change it. I can just be what I am and stay as safe as I can.

115,"Hey everyone, I’ve posted in this Reddit before, but I thought I’d post again. I’m still having takeaways every day. I’m now thinking there’s no point dieting until after Christmas; since there’s nearly less than a month away.

Today I got two takeaways. I got food from a Japanese restaurant and a waffle and cookie dough from a dessert restaurant. But today has felt different than any other day. I’m not sure why but I haven’t felt like bingeing today. Maybe it’s because I’m so fed up of living like this? I know I’ve had two takeaways, but in-between having the breakfast, dinner (the Japanese food) and the two desserts, I haven’t actually done any snacking today. I would usually have chocolates, crisps, sweet things. Today I just haven’t felt like eating. I nearly skipped breakfast today because I just couldn’t be bothered to eat. That’s not like me at all.

Personally, I think my mental health is slowly getting worse. Of course, one factor making it worse is my weight. But another factor is the fact that I live such an isolating, boring life. I have no friends. It’s winter. (my mental health is always worse in winter) I have no boyfriend. I know that that’s not the biggest of deals at the moment, but I did really like this boy, I liked him so much that I went out of my way to find him through people who knew people who knew him. But I think that we could have been together if it wasn’t to do with my weight.

I just feel very hopeless at the moment. Same shit, different day. I’m trying to find a job, but no one wants to hire me because I can’t answer the interview questions correctly. 

I’m trying to find a charity to give me a grant, so I can do an art qualification. But no charity is willing to fund me because a lot of charities only run in a particular area, for example some charities will only give grants to people living in London.

My OCD is playing up as well. Because I'm so overweight, I can't help but notice my heart beat when I try to sleep. I analyse my heart beat and worry if it's going too fast. I'm scared that I won't make it in the morning.

Thankfully the deer just took out the bumper and the left head light and my father and I were left unscathed.
