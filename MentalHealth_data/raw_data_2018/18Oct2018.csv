0,"Hey guys - 

So for a while I've been struggling with anxiety, and my friends know about that, but the past year it's also been OCD and depression. I know they know something is up, and I want to tell them (because there are ways they can help, I just always self-sabotage and don't let myself ask for it) but I'm so scared to do it. I'm afraid it'll be too serious or it'll make them sad. I guess I just need some encouragement on how to bring it up, if I should at all. I know they care about me and will listen and help. I'm just really terrified of bringing it up (because I'm usually very upbeat so a convo like this is hard). Any advice? I appreciate it.

1,"I've had a suicidal plan since last year, and I have no urge to do it right away, but I know WHAT I'd do whenever it came time, if it ever did. It was always just something I took as a fact of my life: When my life fails and I don't succeed in my future, I will do ______. 
I know that having a plan on how you'd kill yourself is worthy of getting admitted, but I'm in college, and I can't afford to miss my classes because that would DEFINITELY have me failing them. 
But I feel kinda scared saying that I don't see my plan from being far off now, because regardless my grades are falling. Of course there are bigger things happening that's making me feel this way, but that's too personal to share. 
TL;DR: I want to tell someone about my suicidal thoughts and plan, but don't want to all of a sudden be put in the hospital when I can't afford to fail at anything else. ",18Oct2018,1
2,"For the last couple years I really haven’t felt much emotion-wise.

I rarely get sad or angry, I also rarely get happy or excited. It’s not as though there’s been nothing happening in my life either, I did well in my exams and got accepted to my first choice uni, moved away from home, met a whole bunch of new people, but at no point did that make me feel happy, excited, nervous or anything like that.

It’s like whatever happens happens, it won’t get to me. I just feel pretty flat.

The only thing that can make me feel anything consistently is my football team, it’s like that’s the only thing that actually matters to me.

3,"I struggle to communicate my ideas, usually flipping through mental flashcards of common phrases that I heard from other people or media of any form such as TV shows. I have a very large library to choose from from lots of experience, but I sometimes devolve into using favorite stock phrases for common situations that can get repetitive at times.

I struggle to feel any empathy for others, but I recognize that I must appear to have empathy, so I attempt to modify my own behavior to say or do the ""correct"" thing in response. I have to force my expression and flip through a separate set of mental flashcards. I don't want to be this way, I really want to fit in, but it is just not possible. Sometimes I do feel what I think is true empathy, but only when I am by myself and reflecting, not during real time interactions.

I prefer to be alone-when anyone else is present I feel subdued, and my normal creative process and wit diminish as if I was being radio jammed. I feel distracted and my normal thought patterns are disrupted.

Otherwise I feel like I am pretty normal, I generally am a positive person, but very self conscious and aware of my flaws, always trying to improve myself. I have respect for other people and always want to treat them well even if I don't know how.",18Oct2018,1

6,"That is pretty much it. I just turned 39 [m] and for the last 6+ months, maybe a little longer, all I think about is death, specifically my own. It's always there, right in the back of my mind even if I'm not outright thinking about it. If I hear of someone dying I look into their age and subtract my own to think about the time I might have left. It's crushing me. I have four beautiful kids, an amazing wife, a good job, but I cannot escape thinking about dying and being paralyzed by those thoughts. It makes enjoying anything hard, I get sad at the thought of missing events in my kid's lives, really anything in the future. I don't know if it's facing my own mortality or something deeper.

8,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a long time. For a brief period I did take medication, but I felt like it didn't work and I didn't want to depend so much on meds. So besides striving to think more positively and trying to adapt healthier habits, I didn't do anything for my mental health. I didn't think there was anything that could be done. Until today.

10,"Hello, everyone. I'm not really as active here on Reddit as I used to be, but I was curious if you all could offer some advice.

Before I really jump in, here are the basics. I'm 22 years old, female, living in the southeast USA. I have depression, anxiety, PTSD, and I'm Aspie. I have shades of some other mental disorders, but I'm not diagnosed officially, so I'm reluctant to namedrop (acronym-drop?).

I've been improving mentally in many respects, but it came up with my boyfriend today when we were speaking earlier that I'm very poor at expressing anger and frustration. I cannot raise my voice beyond a certain level without it cracking, and I tear up and start crying when I'm angry or frustrated, which can make even speaking difficult, much less yelling or even speaking with a louder tone. He thought it was endearing to know I was so sensitive, but he did tell me I needed to work on it. He offered some ways to help, and we did speak a bit about ideas, but I've gotten rather introspective about the whole thing now.

I also have a lot of inhibitions speaking about wants and needs in interpersonal relationships- both platonic and romantic/sexual. I have a much easier time typing things out, but even then I often downplay them and apologize for complaining or just outright delete what i was typing and speak about something else instead.

To make a long story short, I dealt with toxic situations with others for most of my life both with friends and romantic partners. I'm also very much a give person, and it makes me extremely uncomfortable to feel as if I'm taking or having someone do something for me without me reciprocating. Even though I am now in a much healthier place with my family, friends, and boyfriend, I am still incredibly bad at expressing negative or ""selfish"" feelings. I've improved at trying to describe why I feel sad or stressed, but I just lock up when I try to express anger or explain something I want from someone else.

Do you guys have any advice on how to deal with these things? How have you dealt with similar situations?

I do currently have some plans in mind, though they might be a bit... silly.
- Roll down the windows while I'm driving down a highway and yell out them. The chances that others will actually hear and care are remarkably low, right?
- Get a sword and pose/carry it around the house. 
-Carry some kind of self defense thing, like a knife or something, on my person?
- Just practice talking about these topics, maybe record myself?",18Oct2018,1
12,"I have a doctors appointment tomorrow. I'm finally meeting my new family doctor and having a check up. I was wondering if it would be appropriate to tell her about my mental health issues I've been having (depression + suicidal thoughts). I've been going to therapy for 3 years, I went in 2015-2017 and recently started again in the summer with a new therapist. I've been trying to get a diagnosis for a while but cant seem to find a mental health professional who can diagnose me. I was hoping that going to a doctor would get me the diagnosis I need to move forward. 

Have you guys ever done this? Idk how to even being it up or anything, I just really need closure through a diagnosis. I'm 16 btw, and I'd rather my parents not know, so any advice would help. ",18Oct2018,1

16,"I feel like therapy always ends up, no matter where we start or if I feel like I ""click"" with that therapist, it always ends up just being us sitting in awkward silence until I agree with whatever they're saying or answer how they want me to, even if it negates how I actually feel. 

It's almost like a silent battle, where they're going to win by just letting me stew in silence or talking around in circles until I finally give up and just say the positive thing I know they're waiting for me to say. I always know what it is they want me to say, whether it's negating a negative thing I just mentioned, or spin what I'm saying in some bullshit-y optimistic way. I don't really believe it, but I say it just to make the pauses stop. As someone with social anxiety, I'm always extremely quick to just agree in order to make an interaction end, and in therapy, I feel like it's even worse. 

So I just have trouble attempting to really feel heard or to go any further than this. It's what's made me quit and fail at my attempts at therapy over and over again, and yet every time I go back, even with new people, it always feels the same way. 

Am I missing something? Doing something wrong here? Or is therapy just not for me? I feel so stuck because the one thing people say will help me (the therapy), never ultimately does. Just looking for some advice, I guess. ",18Oct2018,1

22,"Maybe this isn't the sub to ask this but I'm here at the moment so why not --

I'm familiar with ""gaslighting"" -  when a person manipulates another person into questioning their own sanity.  I'm also familiar that this is a tactic often associated with the whole Narcissistic Personality Disorder diagnoses.  

I have a friend who for years, anytime I've ever tried to talk to her about something she did or said that was hurtful or demeaning, she's always come back at me with these lectures on how I perceived everything wrong and she attributes it to my mental illness and past experiences of growing up in a violently abusive and dysfunctional home.  Per my understanding of gaslighting, this is exactly what she is doing.  But the other day, when I mentioned this to her after she yet again made comments, she responded by snapping at me that she isn't narcissistic.  

So, I guess my question is...  Is gaslighting a thing only tied to Narcissistic Personality Disorder?  Am I wrong to call what she does to me ""gaslighting""?  

Sorry for being a pain - I just...well, she's succeeded in convincing me that I cannot trust myself or my own mind.",18Oct2018,1

24,"I've done this for a really long time, and I never questioned it, until a couple of weeks ago after watching the Leo Dicaprio movie where he goes to an island where crazy people live.

It's not like a lot of posts in reddit where people say they remembered a debate they had with someone in real life and start talking about what they could've said, it's not like that. 

Basically, after watching a movie, or listening to a song I like, I imagine I directed that movie back in the day, or made that song, and I play out as if I was being interviewed and I talk out loud about the elements that ""I chose"" to make the movie right, or the chord progressions and instrument choice I made to make the song the way it is.

Sometimes I even act out like there's an audience watching me and laughing at something I said.

It's mostly with movies I really really enjoy, and even if they are all from different directors, I imagine myself being like the ultimate director since ""I have made"" so many different movies with such different styles and cinematography. Also imagine myself being a very prolific movie maker, putting out one every year and they all win oscars for something, since I imagine myself being a director that lived in the 70's-80's that is releasing movies with the quality they have today. 

Now, it's not like I sit down, cross my legs and look at nothing as if there was someone there. It happens while I'm doing something else, like watching TV or playing a videogame, I remember that movie I saw and I start talking to myself. I've been caught many times doing this and of course people around me think it's weird and rightly so.

Is this... Normal? At least to a degree? Or just plain over board?

Thank you. ",18Oct2018,1
25,"Sometimes when I get upset or stressed I feel like I need to be hit. Like punched or something. I haven't self-harmed recently (about a year) but I recognize it as a different feeling than the feeling I get when I want to hurt myself. I very specifically want someone else to hurt me. (It's not a sexual thing at all.) I had the feeling once and intentionally antagonized a friend so they'd swat my arm. I felt so incredibly relieved after and was fine, good even, for the whole rest of the day. I was able to move along with my day and get stuff done.

I don't understand why I have that feeling and I'm absolutely certain I'm not explaining it well.

I can not control my negative thoughts of myself. My mind is always jumping to horrible conclusions. While driving I am terrified of getting in a horrible accident. The little “voice inside my head” will come up with all these “what if’s”. Like, what if that guy who swerved wouldn’t have corrected himself in time and hit me and bla bla bla. 

I’ve lost my good job because I started having unbearable anxiety attacks nearly all day every day for close to 2 months. Finally I started spiraling into a deep depression.

I find it hard to talk to friends, family, strangers.. I can barely hold a conversation it feels like. Because I’m worrying if I sound stupid. Worrying about saying too much about what has been going on with me in fear that I’ll either bum them out or cause an anxiety/panic attack for myself and make a scene. 

It’s gotten to the point where I forgot who I am a long time ago. I just don’t know how to bounce back. I can’t stop the “voice in my head” that is beating me up all the time. And my voice in my head, I’m referring to my negative thinking.

40," 

I'm an 18 year old girl who just started her freshman year of college. Like most people, I've felt insecure about my appearance but in high school, it peaked. I always thought it was my nose that was the issue. My mom had a nose job when she was in college so ever since I was 14 she told me if I didn't like my nose by the end of high school, I could get a nose job. Throughout high school, I still felt embarrassed of the way I looked, but it didn't make sense to my friends&amp;family. People would often tell me I'm pretty and girls said they wished they looked like me, my boyfriends' friends would tell me that I'm out of their league. These compliments would lift my confidence up sky high for a little bit, and I really did feel like I was attractive when they said these things. But yet I still scrutinized my appearance every other minute and despised myself for it. I cried all the time if I looked in the mirror too long, I would cut myself, I had an eating disorder for a while. I know this all sounds so shallow and I am ashamed. After being sick and tired of hating myself for the way I looked, I flew to another country, spent thousands of dollars, and got a nose job right after graduation.

I hated the way that it turned out, hated the way I looked now more than I had ever before. I realized I had just expected that I would get my surgery, wake up, and magically be more beautiful. After my nose job, I would spend hours each day looking at old pictures of myself and hating myself more, because I realize there was literally nothing wrong with my old nose. It fit my face perfectly and it wasn't crooked or anything, just a little wider than I would have liked.

When I got back home, my best friend noticed that I got a nose job. I was hoping it would be subtle enough (and not many others noticed) but she knows me well so she could tell. She also told me that other people had come up to her and asked if I had done something to my face, that it was ""so obvious"". For the whole summer, I've felt like people have been staring at my nose and mocking me because of how ugly I am (I know this isn't true but that is how I feel).

Now I keep thinking, ""oh it wasn't my nose that was the problem, it's that my eyes are too close together"". Now I find everything wrong with my face from top to bottom: my forehead doesn't come out enough, my forehead is too large, my eyebrows too sparse, eyelid area too large, eyes aren't wide or big enough, my cheekbones aren't defined enough, my skin is too oily, my face has too much fat, I only have one dimple rather than two, my teeth are too small, my smile doesn't curve enough, my chin is too flat, there isn't enough depth in my face. I read this and I know that my list is crazy. But when I look in the mirror, my face looks distorted, as if the placement of features doesn't quite make sense and it's all abstract. It disgusts me and confuses me at the same time. What I wish to do is get surgical enhancements to make my list go away, but I know now that won't fix it. I know I have to accept myself or whatever and go get help from a professional. However, my major is psychology and I'm embarrassed to go get help because it feels like I should just be able to help myself, or I'm not really cut out to be in my major.

I’ve been going through a major depressive episode and I’ve noticed that things around me seem to be duller. It actually feels ‘greyer’ and my senses seem to be dulled. It feels like I’m not actually here with everyone else. I live on campus and even when surrounded by hundreds of other students I feel like they are living in a completely different world or “plane” than I am. Like I’m floating along or looking in from the outside. Everything feels very flat. Has anyone else experienced this?,18Oct2018,1
43,"I'm 29 years old, with 30 looming on the horizon. I've lived a very nomadic adult life, dedicating the majority of my energy to a career that had me traveling constantly, meeting amazing new people and having constant fun. As much as I've loved it, I don't quite have the energy for the long hours and nonstop movement and partying that the job entailed, so I've been wanting to ""settle"" down at least a little bit. I put all of my eggs in one basket hoping to settle in with my 3 year boyfriend in a city I absolutely love (where he lives). Just before this was supposed to happen, he broke up with me and everything has been falling apart since then. 

I moved to LA to try to fulfill a lifelong dream of living here and working in the film industry. I quickly realized that the madness of this city wasn't suited to my current state, so I decided to go back to the city I had previously lived in. My old employer offered me my old job back, and then rescinded their offer due to a scheduling conflict. Things haven't been working out left and right for me, in a way that I have never experienced. Things have always been challenging in the past, but jobs, couches to sleep on, etc, have always fallen into place until now. Now I am struggling everywhere I turn. I am unemployed, already have plans in motion to go back to a city where I no longer have a job, and am fucking lonely as hell. 

I put so much mental energy on settling with my boyfriend in that city, with a full-time job, now it all feels so heavy and so hard. I am stressing too hard that I won't fall in love again before my body is too old to have children, and that I won't find a job that fulfills me, or another city that feels like home the way that one did. I just got back from my sister's wedding and as much as it was good to see my family, it was overwhelming to be surrounded by so many couples and babies and love. 

I see how typical and ""easy"" this problem is, and I'm sure it will just take time, but I am hurting so much right now. I have been suffering from depression my whole life, but this time it has come with intense feelings of no longer wanting to live, and on the plane ride home last night I envisioned asking my family for permission to no longer live. While I know that I will not do that, I have been stripped of any goals or visions of the future. My life feels empty and really, really fucking shitty. The only way to continue seems to be to allow it to feel empty, and to just do the things that I will probably thank myself for later. 

I guess I am just posting here in hopes that maybe a few people out there could let me know how they've gotten through these times, and just to know that there are other people out there. ",18Oct2018,1
44,"**My experience with Depression, Anxiety, “Bipolar” and “Schizophrenia”**

**Foreword**

I  am only writing this to get my experience and my point of view out  there so that I can potentially help other kids through Depression,  Anxiety and these bullshit “Mental Illnesses”. I don’t wish for my name  or anything to be put out there I am only wanting to help others out  there to figure out themselves and hopefully for all these “Illnesses”  to be re diagnosed and to share what I think they actually are. I have  always shared this experience with my doctors and the Prince Charles  Hospital in Brisbane, Australia and there Psych ward that I was  forcefully admitted into (more on this later) and TLDR at the bottom for  the ones who aren’t bothered to read...

**Please  bare with me and my writing as I don’t really know how to write this  all up properly and it is probably gonna be all over the place but I  tried to put my words in writing the best I could and I am not going to  go into allot of detail about everything but enough to make it known.**

Oh  and I am Australian for you Americans that probably won’t figure that  one out :) and I am open to questions and corrections as this is all  just from what I believe..

**My Background**

Looking  back at my past and thinking about allot of what happened this is what I  believe caused my life to lead to these events and for me to figure out  what was going on with myself as I honestly didn’t know what was going  on. As any normal person who has grown up in this shit society where the  older generations have constantly told us what to do, what to think,  what was wrong with us I thought I had “Bipolar” and Schizophrenia but I  did my research on every “Mental Illness” I could think of and I just  simply didn’t sit with any of them.....

Anyway a little about myself currently before we start off to make things a bit more obvious that I am a capable adult.

* I am currently 23 years of age,
* I have held 4 jobs including a managerial position for a year. Minimum 3 months at each, most 1 year.
* 4 certificates in various subjects (IT, Business).
* I own my own car,
* I had a drivers license for 6 years before loosing it and
* I have been living on my own for the past 7 months.
* I also lost around 60Kg’s in less then a year from under eating... I was about 130KG’s in my prime.
* I was never able to sleep well at all for as long as I could remember.
* I feel I am a very Logical and Perceptive person

First  things first, Parenting. I strongly believe this is the main and core  factor to anyone’s “Mental Illness’s” unless you were obviously born  with it like Down-Syndrome ect ect. Now my Mum believed in that you  should love everyone, everything and basically never taught me the good  the bad and the ugly whereas my Dad did try to teach me these things but  I was the “Mummies boy” of the family so eventually he gave up because  my mum probably kept telling him off. The parents eventually split up  probably around 5 - 8 years ago, I don’t really remember and they  obviously split cause they weren’t really compatible and didn’t enjoy  each other.

My  Dad was an alcoholic towards the end of the marriage and was depressed  with anxiety as well and I didn’t really know him that well nor did we  really do anything towards my older years.

My  Brother was a pretty smart kid, we did get along allot when we were  young, playing video games, riding bikes ect ect the normal kid stuff.  But again towards the older years we fell apart.

Me:  I was always fat, bullied and basically spent most of my years in my  bedroom or the living room playing video games and maybe had 1 or 2 good  friends when I was growing up. When I was older (High school age) I  really only played video games till the late night and maybe once a  month went out with my friends. I didn’t really know how to socialize  and kinder just slipped into groups and did whatever I could for the  others to like me. I was expelled from high school in grade 10 for what I  honestly believe is cause the teachers didn’t like me because I always  tried to stick up for my friends and question the teachers when they  made stupid decisions. There were some moments where I did

do  wrong like throwing rocks and spitting but I never hurt anyone with  those actions (stupid childish things). I have never hit anyone out of  anger or been in a physical fight and barely in a vocal fight because I  always tried to stay away from drama.

I  think that is enough information to explain my past but there are a few  other moments which made me have repressed memories which I don’t wish  to publicly announce..

**My Experience**

Anyway  the Depression and Anxiety mostly hit hard about 2 or 3 year ago and I  moved states which I planned a month in advance before going about 7 - 8  months ago. My main reason at the time for moving was cause I felt  lonely and felt like I needed to start a new life. About 3 weeks into  the new life I got a job at a large company doing IT Help desk dealing  with mostly public government employees in a cubical, in a colorless  large room with about 30 other people around me. I stayed at this job  for about 3 months before I quit because I felt like it was sucking my  soul out staying there and this began my deep cycle of Depression and  Anxiety.

By  this time I was smoking quite a bit of weed and I was high most days  including some days at work. After the 3 months I basically gave up on  getting a job and sat at the place I was living at smoking weed,  drinking occasionally to try and tame my Anxiety and overthinking of  every situation I was in. I didn’t go out much only when I needed too  and only really talked to 2 of my room mates who were in there late 20‘s  one of which was pretty much in the same situation as me but had gone  through it so much worse and had gotten into far worse drugs.

I  had also taken LSD, Shrooms a couple of times during the start of my  new life which was at a friends party and had figured out recently I was  drugged with Ecstasy at the party (MDMA, Molly, caps all the same shit  but less pure, different shit mixed in ect ect...). I don’t remember  pretty much anything during the night of this party as it all is a blank  due to what I believe was the Ecstasy as LSD and Shrooms just make you  trip and I believe unless in massive quantities it won’t make you black  out or have memory loss.

Now  I did my research on these drugs and from my understanding LSD and  shrooms are Psychedelics and Ecstasy is a Psychoactive, so take that as  you will.

Anyway  skipping forward to about 1 month ago I got fed up with the room mates  and the older adult in the house so I moved once again to a far nicer  place, close to the beach and I was enjoying life I was recouping and  trying to eat all natural as I thought this was a good thing to do but I  kept loosing weight and my sleep was still getting worse and worse.  Skipping forward again I was on about 2 to 3 hours of sleep towards the  end of my life at the second place and I basically started witnessing  some of the “Mental Illnesses” of Bipolar and Skits which were mostly  Hallucinations and before you ask, no I don’t remember what I was  Hallucinating about nor do I remember a lot of what was going on. When I  was about the third day and basically the last of this deep dive I went  to admit myself into the local hospital but thankfully my overthinking  made me scared to go to the hospital because I knew how they would treat  me after I explained everything so I called my mum for help  instead.......

I  later then had another episode after my mum had helped me and took me  back home. I thought people were trying to break into my house and I had  locked and barricaded myself in. I was in this situation for about 20  minutes before calling the Police and the Ambulance also arrived. Later  on I found out that it was only my Mum and her BF that were in the  house. So know this is the Hospital bit, I explained everything in allot  more detail of what I have gone through and going through to one of the  ambulance drivers and to about 4 “Doctors” at the hospital and was  there for about 7 hours before probably the scariest moment of my life  to be honest.

The  final doctor came in about twice, first time I explained in detail on  what happened and the second time he came in angry and aggressive and he  basically wouldn’t listen to me and during the whole time I was calm  and collective but super tired from talking about it 4 times. Anyway  TLDR on the Doctor was that he threatened to physically take me down and  inject me if I didn’t comply... and this was at about 11pm at night. I  was then forcefully put under the Mental Health Act 2016 which meant I  had to comply or they could do whatever they wanted to me... So after  that happened I was taken down to the ward and if you have ever watched a  horror movie about a Phsyc Ward its basically the same thing... I then  saw another 2 doctors and I explained the same thing to them before I  then was finally put into a room on my own with a door that is not  lockable so the nurses and doctors can come in anytime.

Anyway  first night I was scared shit less and locked myself in the bathroom  with my bedding as it was the only place that was lockable and the  nurses kept coming in and they came in probably twice when I was in the  bathroom and I said to them I was fine and I basically was trying to get  some sleep as I was hella tired then at about I think 2 - 3am in the  morning child protective services and a nurse came in and I came out and  complied with them and went back into my bed and then the doctor  injected me with something that put me to sleep (wouldn’t have a clue  what it was). I was in this ward for about 5 days and I complied with  everything even to be doped up on the drugs that made me feel like shit  just so I could get out quicker. I also learnt all my rights while in  there and sometimes I had to force my way around obstacles to figure  these out by asking visitors if I could use there phone to call  Independent rights peoples....

I  hope this is enough backstory to explain what I believe these things  are, I tried my best to simplify it and not to put too much information  in to protect myself and my Family who I still love even though they  didn’t understand anything I said and thought I actually had these  Mental Illnesses.

**My Own Diagnosis - TLDR**

Okay  now so I believe that Bipolar and Schizophrenia are actually self  defense mechanism’s or “super human” abilities to keep you alive and if  you have the will to live and you go through it all it will get you  through enough before you die and I was dying. There was a point where I  was going in and out of conciseness and I do believe I saw the “Light”  at the end of the tunnel which is something that I have thought allot  about since and absolutely scares the shit out of me. Also the obvious  well I hope its obvious that depression and anxiety are states of minds  and not illness’s....

Again  I am writing this from my perspective and my believes. I am not a  doctor or anything like this but what I saw from the “doctors” I en  counted I am absolutely sickened and some of them need to be in Psych  wards themselves or better yet in jail for there complete stupidity and  incompetence. The hospital in question should and I hope gets publicly  shamed and reformed... There were also a few good people there that did  help me through this, mostly the younger doctors and the independent  people who actually do want to help people there especially the kids.  It’s also a hospital which they do help people and all this shouldn’t  affect that fact....

If someone wants to put this in better words I am super happy for that to happen as I am obviously not a writer..

I hope this can bring some good back to the world and these things I have talked about be reformed and opened up publicly.",18Oct2018,1
46,"I lived through constant abuse and mental abuse from my own father during the time I was in my high school year until I started to gain some self control. But later on I start to notice something even till now that, most of the memories that were in parts are gone. Its like I repress my memories and throw it out like a deleted folder. But in my mind it's something like this, go see a movie, person yells at me, I sit on my seat and exit out.  Now by the end of the day it would be exactly like this scenario but just remove the person yelling like a video editing and I just don't remember for some reason. Even most of my friends tell me moments when something bad happened  I don't remember those moments bc it was not worth remembering then I just forget. So this only works in some cases when I probably find the person worthless or perhaps something I dislike that a person reminds me of.Of course some of my memories return if a person gave me a full detail of what happened when i was there then it would suddenly come back to me.

50,"My therapist thinks I should write letters to people in my life. I plan on following through on this and maybe taking suggestions from my friends to turn it into a book. Here is my letter to Tom, tell me what you think. 

To Tom,

It was cosmic(the name of the album of music I was listening to at 2:50 AM by Bazzi), something I could of only dreamed (reference to the song Dreams by Bazzi, which was the exact song that triggered these thoughts) of, still to this day I thank god for you in my life at the exact period you were there. You were pivotal in the person I would become and you taught me to never regret the past. We were so bitterly young and maybe if it was another time in our lives it could have worked. The beginning was somewhat of a breakthrough to me, I really started trusting myself to express my sexuality. You gave me the power to not be ashamed of who I was in public which was a gay male. I trusted myself to reach out to somebody. I don’t remember exactly how we found each other at that precise time but till this day I think it was the exact time it should have lasted. I will never get that back. As our relationship went on I developed a serious illness very quickly which would later be diagnosed as bipolar. I am so sorry for that person I was to you, I have learned so much from analyzing our relationship. I still remember to this day our entire conversation we had on the phone (in the hospital Community medical center sitting across from my dad) when eventually I wound up in the state hospital, a little after I was admitted you broke my world and shattered the light I was grasping for at the end of the tunnel. Nothing mattered in my world unless you were in it. I learned why I called you a week later and had no recollection of you breaking up with me, I was in intense emotional shock. I had never experienced such emotional stress in my life until those moments we had on the telephone as you told me you could no longer take the pressure I had placed on you to be my boyfriend and my rock and my all.  You were the sweetest and explained we were no longer together, it had sunk in, I remember looking to the hospital worker in the room and I said “It’s all over” the world I had known as being happy and purely enjoying life as a well human being. Soon I would learn what being bipolar really meant. Those times I had lashed out to you and starting losing touch with life will always haunt me. My first love and always in my heart human soul was shattered by my best friend and guiltily self enemy bipolar. Because of that you will always be a shadow in my mind of a time once which was pure and true.",18Oct2018,1
51,"I have a not insane work load tbh but I have a hard time sitting still and doing the work. Even with meds I'm pretty bad with it. Anyways because of the work load with myself being really prone to procrastination  and depression I get little to no sleep. It's gotten pretty bad, I just don't sleep for a day or 2 many days. Of course I sleep but I legit have to just stay up many times. I'm so sick of it. I'm just taking a break from work rn to write this because I can't focus on my work until I write this down/get it out then its right back to work for me yey -_-. I'm getting off topic: not sleeping is starting to really fuck me up but I can't bring myself to sleep because I need to work. Even stopping my ADHD meds isn't helping. I can't really even focus on the work but I have 2 midterms Friday (haven't even studied for them yet because I was busy with my other papers, required notes and midterms in other classes) and a large amount of notes I couldn't bring myself to finish before. I wish I had a way out of this but I legit can't manage time so I have to cram everything into large increments of working on school and I doubt my teachers would have any form of pity for my predicament (nor should they since they know nothing of my problem and as I said before its not even that bad of a workload. Plenty of students have way more to do and still don't struggle like this). 

This is the 5th(?) time this semester I've had to stay up more than 24 hours to do work. Worst of all I have a hard time sleeping in general so when this happens i usually can't fall asleep until 9pm if I stay up that long. Sorry I don't know where this is going since I don't think I can do anything about this. I don't think I could sleep if I wanted too since I would know that I'm fucked because I didn't do my work or studied at all. I feel trapped.

52,"I think that any reasonable person with a sense of self-worth would probably have committed suicide if they had my life. My mom once asked me out of nowhere if I don't enjoy anything. I smiled and said my life is fine. That was eight years ago. I didn't enjoy it eight years before that question, and not eight years later. It still hurts, burning me from the inside.

So far a strong sense of responsibility and duty and shame prevented me from collapsing from depression and anxiety and other things. Knowing I'll have to face my disappointed parents and be criticized was a big enough motivation to get my lazy ass up and do some work even if I felt like wearing a lead blanket and just wished I could disappeared. One of the most painful things is gender dysphoria. Sometimes I feel ashamed and close to crying, but then I just think that life doesn't matter and that I don't mater. Then I turn on some happy music and sing along. Day for day. Year for year. I dislike negativity and melancholy.

I have avoidant personality disorder. I think that's why I'm still here. That basically means I avoid conflicts, I don't like doing things that upset other people. Suicide seems like such a big deal and taboo that it makes me feel guilty just to think about it. Yet I cannot express or put in words how much I dislike this life. I want to be angry but I can't. When I read how people write how valuable life is, how things can get better, and how we need more suicide prevention, I feel sick. It makes me feel invalidated. There was nothing wonderful or great in my life since I was a little kid. Abusing medication or drugs is probably the only thing that can make me feel better, but I'm not doing it would be inappropriate, and because lifting the weight for a short time isn't going to do anything.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. It's obvious that no one understands except those in a similar situation. It's obvious how professionals try to say the appropriate and ethical things, but the real world works in a *completely* different way. I've seen psychiatrists and therapists struggling to say something and I don't blame them.",18Oct2018,1

I have reached a point in my life wherein I am falling apart, and nobody even knows that— because I never open up.

I want to go to a doctor and have myself checked to see whether I really have depression or not. I want to get helped before I lose my sanity and finally kill myself.

I've been having alot of thoughts about death ever since and it would never fail to cause a great disturbance to my life. Everyday, I live with a voice inside of my head that tells me that I'm better off dead. Often times, I could see myself hanging lifelessly or even find myself choking on my own hands.

Although there are times I can ignore those thoughts and stop myself from self-harming— there are times in which I can't. It gets worse and my thoughts would never seem to disappear.

I sincerely want to get helped before it's too late, but I am so afraid to open up and talk about my real feelings. I am so scared to tell my mother how I've been having the thoughts to die, I didn't want to break her heart or make her think of me differently now. People see me as the goofy and quirky one, and the thought of them being aware of my condition and probably seeing me as someone different doesn't fail to scare me to the core.

54,"I recently found out I've been hypersexual my whole life and it explains so much.

I'm now having an identity crisis.

I've identified as bisexual for years because I've had sex with women. Thinking back, I believe I have only had sex with women when I was in a manic state. Since going on bipolar medication three years ago I have noticed I'm not really sexually attracted to women, except when I'm manic. Does this mean I'm straight and just so sexually charged when manic I'll have sex with anyone? Or am I bisexual but not very far on that side of the scale except when manic? 

Related question: If I consented to sex with people while I was clearly not attracted to them or desiring of them to the point of dissociation during sex.... Is that assault?

I'm struggling really hard right now. I've been having severe pelvic pain for weeks. Even went to the hospital this weekend because of suspected appendicitis. While in the hospital my mental health deteriorated quickly. 

I'm at the point now where I cut myself for the first time in 5 months. Exercise feels awful because of my levels of pain. I'm suicidal and driving is very hard because I want to kill myself.

I have an appointment with my GYN later today.

64,"Hey guys,

I’ve spoken to a doctor today regarding medication and pregnancy, and due to being on risperidone for about four years now I have very high prolactin. This makes it more difficult to conceive. I don’t plan to have children for a few more years, but the doc said it’s best to think about it in advance. 

I’m on some other medication too, but she said they’re fine (though with all medication comes risk) with pregnancy. 

She’s suggested Aripiprazole, and wants me to change to that ASAP. 

Does anyone have any experience with Aripiprazole? What are the side effects for you personally?

Also, I have a full time job where I cannot take extended periods of time off, so what’s the best way to go about changing medication while still working?

67,"Hello, I'm a 22y old male, and I need some serious help.

I have autism, which is bad enough already, but on top of that, I have severe Anxiety, severe OCD, and mild depression which will get worse if I don't stop the problem of these anxieties. 

I'll explain the best I can, please forgive me if my words are all over the place, I'm not good at writing much.



I have an incredibly crippling fear of being seen, looked at, or watched by other people, this extends to maybe just not taking my rubbish out because my neighbours might see me or being scared looking out my window out of fear someone will look back. 
It's gotten to the point where I can't even shop for food and my  house is full of trash because my snoopy neighbour always looks out her door every time I open mine.

I haven't been out in the day time for God knows how long, I go out and check my mail when it's about 2am because all my neighbours will be asleep and I won't have to worry about them seeing me, but even then, I have troubles opening my front door.

This also extends to sound. I never make any noise in my apartment, I always wear headphones, and I tip toe around because I don't want everyone else to hear me walking around. 
Every time I hear a car pull up to visit the woman who lives next door, I pause everything and turn off the lights, because I don't want them to know I'm here, or something. 

I would go to a psychologist but that would require going outside, which means others would see me and look at me. Plus, I won't be able to talk about anything with said psychologist, because of my fear of talking to people. Especially with a problem as stupid and embarrassing as this.

I don't know why I'm like this. It's crippling and controlling and I have no idea what to do to get a hold of it.
Very rarely can I go outside alone, the only time I actually can is if I'm with someone, like my mother or a friend or something.
When I'm with someone the fear gets subdued a little bit, but there's still alot of anxiety there. So much so that I will cancel a friend visit if I don't think I look good enough for them to see.

I'm incredibly insecure and self concious, I make sure I look my best when I leave the house, which I guess isn't all that odd, but it gets to extreme lengths, like wearing a jacket because it fits an outfit, even though it's a blazing hot day outside, or faking an eye exam to get glasses I don't need, just because they might look good on me.
And if I DO leave my house, I will refuse to leave without a hat on.

Look, I know this seems like an easy fix, but I've been like this for so long, I've started to gain a lot of weight from sitting down and eating like shit because I don't want to leave the house.
I have pretty much accepted the fact that I'll never get a lover or ever have sex because I'm too self concious and afraid of it all.

I know I can't escape the fact that people will look at me regardless, I know it's a rule of life that everyone will always judge others...
But that's exactly what makes it so bad. KNOWING that people naturally judge one another and maybe look at each other fucking terrifies me enough to never want to see another human face again.

I'm too scared to take up any new hobbies, I'm too scared to go see places I've always wanted to.
Even when my mother took me on holiday, I never got out of the car or hotel room.

For others this seems like a ""just do it"" kind of thing, where you won't improve unless you push through it.

But it's fucking crippling, I can't escape this fucking fear racking my brain every single day. I wish I could just disappear and have everyone forget about me. I wish I could kill myself or something, I don't even know anymore. I feel myself going insane from the lack of human contact I get. My house is making me sick from the fucking mess that's in here.

I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid to try myself because if I stay in charge like this, I'll probably die here.

I need help, please. ",18Oct2018,1

I realize others are different from me and dont necessarily need the same thing I needed.  I very rarely reply to these people on reddit.   I do think the responses of sympathy they get are probably bad and only encourage people to not look for solutions.

72,"For the past few months I’ve had this constant thought in the back of my mind that even if I did all the things that I want to do e.g. travel, see amazing sights, fall in love, go scuba diving... that in the end it would basically mean nothing because I’d only feel happy in that moment and then would have to return to reality - and I would even struggle to enjoy being happy in the moment because I KNOW that I have to return to reality afterwards.  

I also realised that there is nothing that I can think of that would make me crazy happy. In fact I can’t remember the last time I was genuinely excited about something or extremely happy about something. Money, having kids, getting married... all these things don’t matter to me at all and I’ve definitely toyed with the idea of never doing or having any of those things that people normally dream about/work towards. 

Life to me right now is (as awful as it sounds) being born, going to school so you can work for the rest of your life, getting a job, working for the rest of your life, then dying. People always say it’s “about the little things in between” i.e. moments of happiness, going on holiday, spending time with your kids etc. but for what? 

I definitely didn’t always feel this way but the more I think about it the more it makes sense in my head and the more I feel lacklustre about anything, even things that I enjoy doing. The most enjoyment I’d get out of activities is a 5 out of 10. It’s kind of like when you see something funny on social media and you type “lol” but your IRL reaction is nil. 

Is there anyone else feeling this way? Have you found anything that pulls you out of the rut? Is this normal?

I was still very shocked but didn't show it but I've never known someone with depression who actually hurt themselves. 
I have no idea what to do, should I talk about it with her, what she wants me to do when it hits her again and tell her how important she is to me and her family?

76,"#Background

15(M) in the UK. I have selective mutism, I am only able to speak to my parents and siblings. Nobody else. I have four friends, only one of which who invites me to something (only his birthday once a year). I also have autism, which helps me academically but not socially in school, which at this point is the only thing that I have in life. But the idea of never being able to use my skills due to anxiety and huge lack of social skills is worrying.


#Story

I've had this problem my whole life. So due to anxiety I had to get a 1-1 throughout all of primary school (which starts from when you're 3 until you're 11). The problem was was that they changed 1-1 every so often so whenever I got more comfortable, boom. Back to square one. This repetition for six years straight only made it worse, changing my routine constantly causing stress. So after that. 

I didn't really hear anything until year 9 (13) when they decided to get a teacher (who had success with a girl with SM in the past) to give me therapy. It felt like they were only there to pressure me to talk to them, which made me less comfortable as her goal was to get me to speak to her as quick as possible. Not small steps like saying ""hi"" to someone you walk past on the street. It was so pressuring that only after a few weeks of this she left the room and attempted to force me to speak into a audio recorder. I froze, sitting there for I don't know how long. When they found out that it isn't that easy, they returned to relaxation methods. And then realised they can't relax me into it and just gave up. I haven't seen the since.

 During the holiday between year 10 and 11 (15), I found out symptoms about autism, then found that I had been diagnosed (similar time to when my dad told me that why I couldn't speak was because of a named disorder). This tipped me over the edge. I couldn't belive that my parents would hide this from me for so long. I fell into a pit. I felt trapped, like I will never be able to act normal. 15 years  of not being able to communicate, means 15 years on possible training for social skills (and counting).

At first I only focused on the positives, the things which help me. Then I found more and more negatives for autism. I could relate to most of them. I was discussing ways to commit suicide in my head in multiple occasions, but at the same time thinking that I can't do it. I've heard too many people say it's not an escape, I will make everyone upset, I could have a bright future. Who knows? But I couldn't get the thoughts out of my head. Feeling hopeless, I kept these thoughts in my head and struggled as mcuh as I can to hold back the tears (unless I know I would be alone). 

Recently I was taken to a mental health hospital, we spent about 20 minutes there and by the end they just said something along the lines of ""we can't help you, you have to do it your self, it only takes will power"". Yeah great, thanks. Thanks for trying and failing for 12is years straight and then giving up on me. 


**Currently**

At this point, I'm only getting amusement out of youtube and social media. It helps me forget about it. But the. I have days where its on my mind and I can't get rid of it. I find (luckily) that I have no idea where to start to even attempt suicide.

I have 4 friends, but wouldn't call 3 of them that. Only one attempts to talk to me, invites me to things he does (which isnt that often because he's lonely also) because since I don't speak he often wants at least one other person there. (story time). On at Least 3 occasions in the past 2 years, the 3 'friends' I was talking about earlier talk about the things they did together the night before, then turn to me and ask, ""why didn't you come"".. I was never invited or even knew about it. 

My parents don't know about me knowing about my autism, they don't know about most of this. I get a weird feeling everytime I talk about things like this with them, I don't like it. I don't like the way they act in situations like this. *(For example, I did something that I wouldn't normally do, something minor, and they over emphasised a shocked face.)* but I'm not, and may never be, prepared to tell them.

I mean who wants something like me? ",18Oct2018,1
77,"Hi guys. I'm here to post about something that has been ongoing for a long, long while now. I won't go into detail as to why, as to not bore anyone to death, and I'm not sure why I'm making a post in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm exhausted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've expired the last safe haven I had, for one reason or another. I watched it go down in flames(metaphorically), and I was helpless to do anything.

Perhaps that's the issue. I feel helpless. I feel like I can't change anything, and even if I do, more problems will spawn out of it to add to the ones that exist.

My relationship with my parents are not swell, as they tend to make me feel obsolete. Like nothing important. My friends are all in their own world, and I've lost any hobby that made me happy. I do art, but ever since it became my work(high school, mom forced me into taking art when I wished to study music, since art had a lot of branches I could make money out of, but music didn't), I developed a love-hate relationship with it.

Currently I can't do work. I can't draw, even though I have a deadline on the 20th of October, a work that pays, and I just can't work. I can't wake up, I can't fall asleep, I don't eat well or consume mostly sweets, or whatever that's left over. I'm alone in my head. My fiancé, bless him, he tries. He tries so hard to keep me up and I love him so much, so much it hurts to see him waste away with me. I only want him to be happy, and I fear I won't change in state, and I will only make him suffer, too.

Emotionally, I got worse after my hero died. Death by suicide. My mind still rings, ""How are you to survive if he couldn't?""

I'm tired. My antidepressants aren't working, and I have no means on finding a good therapist and get the help I so desperately need. 

Tired of trying to make something out of myself, trying to work, trying to function, trying to solve problems that are mine and aren't mine but simply tossed onto my shoulder because why not? Why did I exist, anyway? 

I've grown so tired that I can't even bring myself to self-harm, or try suicide again. I simply exist. And it's so tiring.

I want to be better, I want to get better, I want to be the best of who I can be, I want to do work, I want to create and draw and make music and I can with all the tutorials I can find but

78,"I'm currently having an issue that I absolutely don't know how to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been together with this girl for quite a while. We get along very, very well, have a lot of interests in common and generally just enjoy doing things together, being together and I'd honestly dare say I actually love this girl. But right now I feel like I (and the people around her) are losing her, and I don't know what to do about it. 

Yesterday, she's left the hospital after staying there for a week. She came in with very, very bad stomach and back pain and problems vomitting (which also included blood, which was especially concerning). The former complaints had been going on for a while but it was nowhere as bad as that night. They gave her stuff to relieve the pain, with somewhat seemed to work, and she eventually stopped vomiting too. But blood tests, echos and all the other tests they did on her showed absolutely nothing abnormal. 

Turns out it was a psychological problem. The doctors at the hospital explained that she's been under so much stress, that it eventually started affecting her body instead of her mind. Didn't seem so strange when they told us so; school gives her a lot of stress, but she's also responsible for most of the family's household (single dad who works at night and does more hours than he should and as a result is almost never there, and a younger brother), was in the middle of moving, she has very few people she can really talk to and well, I can name quite a few other things. However, her family is working on improving a lot of this, and she won't be attending school for a while either.

The thing is, she's struggled with depression, among other things, in the past. Mostly because of the loss of a parent and an abusive childhood, She's had suicidal thoughts as well (and actually tried before), which scares me a lot, but since I've known her, things haven't been so bad in that sense. (at least, as far as I'm aware) She's told me she's found a lot of support and help in me, mostly because I'm generally a very optimistic and happy person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've met her through boxing as this happy girl who was enthusiastic and energetic, and who totally made me fall heads over heels for her, but things are changing. I study in a big city and only come back home in the weekends where I see her, but I stayed over a lot while she was at the hospital and I just saw that happy enthusiasm sip away slowly as she was stuck there (not that she didn't need the help) in a matter of a week. Not that I didn't see it get worse bit by bit before that, but this week was especially bad. Now she's back home and barely says a word, stares a lot, can't be happy about anything and just generally does nothing (she needs to rest, but even then.). From now one she has regular appointments with her doctor and now a psychologist (which she'd had before in the past) so I know she's going to get the help she needs, but I can't bare seeing her like this. Today when the doctor asked her anything that would make her happy, she just said my name, and hasn't spoken since. 

I know she's getting help and that things should improve but will take time, but I don't know what to do in this kind of situation. I'm going back home in the weekend and will be visiting her for sure (which she's asked), but I don't know. I'd do anything I can that could potentially help her in anyway, but I have zero experience or knowledge on this and any advice or help would be appreciated. I just want to see this girl back to the way she was before. I want things to get better for her. but I can also say that I'm very scared myself, too.

79,"I'm a university professor.  Earlier this year, I had a complete breakdown.  I was in crisis for the better parts of two months and very nearly had to be hospitalized due to suicidal impulses.  Thankfully, I found the help I needed and I'm doing much better now.

While I was in crisis, I made the decision to open up to my students in class about what I was going through.  I felt they deserved to know why I wasn't performing up to my own standards.  The student response was overwhelmingly supportive.  I hadn't really expected that.  What was even more surprising, though, was the number of students who approached me about their own mental health struggles, thanking me for opening up.  I heard from so many students that it made them feel safe, really for the first time, to talk about their own issues and that they were grateful to see that they, too, could be successful even with mental health problems.

I honestly never suspected that so many students were struggling.  I assumed, as so many people do, that my problems were somehow unique, that I was all alone.  This experience, though, has convinced me that faculty need to be doing more--much more--to advocate for student mental health.  I'm not sure how to begin that conversation with my colleagues, but I'm determined to try.

So one day I decided that enough is enough and I need to grow up, so I left the country and quit everything cold turkey and just hung out in las vegas for 2 weeks. I even quit smoking cigarettes.

84,"I am a senior in high school. I dealt with depression for all of middle school and most of my freshman and sophomore years. It has been off and on since, but right now I am pretty content and happy. 

Lately, probably in the past year or so I have noticed that the terms depression and anxiety are used extremely lightly. Everyday, I hear multiple people saying they have depression and/or anxiety. I’m pretty sure being sad for a day and getting nervous reading in front of the class doesn’t mean you have these mental disorders. It really aggravates me that people just throw these sensitive words around. It almost seems like it makes people who legitimately have these problems inferior because “everybody experiences depression and anxiety” when thats actually not the case at all. 

Even on other social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, I constantly see people throwing these terms around. 

Does anybody else notice this at their schools or on social media’s and are as aggravated and pissed off about it as I am? People don’t understand what these disorders are actually like, and it really makes it seem like a common issue when it really isn’t. People who actually have these problems are probably disregarded by most because it has become such a light subject matter, since “everybody” has these problems now. ",18Oct2018,1

87,"For the last 2 years of my life I've felt like my mental health has been on a rapid decline. I wont be able to seek professional help for another couple of months due to family/transport reasons. I guess I am making this post as I have feel that I no one to vent to. I am afraid that what I am feeling is not valid and that seeking help is pointless and that there is nothing really wrong with me. I would like to know if anyone else experiences similar feelings and what help they received and if what I am feeling is really a mental illness. 

I am constantly feeling completely psychically and mentally exhausted. I struggle to get out of bed, lose my appetite and find it extremely hard to do any cleaning/activities. I struggle to fall asleep at night and still feel exhausted if I get a decent amount of sleep. I don't enjoy my hobbies anymore. I cant bring myself to read a book and I can't even bring myself to play my favorite video games. I feel completely worthless. My self esteem is so bad that simply seeing my reflection in a window has caused me to cry and I have become obsessed with wanting to fix my appearance. I have suicidal thoughts regularly but I never thought on acting on it until recently. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a rocky relationship with my mother who lashes out at me whenever she is stressed, angry or sad. When she is lashing out at me I have urges to self harm. I also have these urges when I have upset someone, when I fuck something up and when I am angry at myself.   


I've developed a habit of pushing people away and cutting them out of my life when they get too close to me. I also notice that my view of someone will just completely change one day with no valid reason and I will purposely do things to make them no longer like me. I don't know why I do this and I end up regretting my actions later as I have pushed away most of my friends. I feel incredibly lonely but I am scared to let new people into my life. I have this weird paranoia that everyone is out to get me and that they are only being friendly/listening to me for malicious reasons. I crave an intimate relationship but as soon as I actually get somewhere with someone I become riddled with anxiety and I cut ties with them.  I also have a habit of completely isolating myself from everyone I know for months on end. The only regular social interactions I have are with online friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I go through periods of being easily irritable and impulsive and I have been making incredibly stupid decisions. I am a completely different person to who I was 2/3 years ago.

I have done numerous online tests for anxiety, depression and BPD but something in my head just keeps telling me that what I am feeling is not valid and that I'm selfish for thinking that I need help.

88,"I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression in the past two months due to losing my younger brother as well as realizing I no longer want to continue graduate school. I'm currently 200 miles away from my loved ones living in an apartment alone. Graduate school is very isolating to begin with, but combined with anxiety and depression it's become unbearable. I've opted to go to work for a few years to get some money and experience then continue in a different program which I'm more interested and more stable.

I feel like I'm in a tailspin but I can't reach out to those who I care for (hence the post here). I wake up, go to class, and barely speak with anyone. I've been doing this for weeks. I feel like when I reach out to my best friend, he doesn't want to hear about how bad things are for me anymore. He's going through his own stuff. I don't want my girlfriend to see how fragile I actually am right now; the confidence is such a shame and I'm scared that if I text too much I'll come off as clingy. It's only been a few months, when we started dating I wasn't in this mental state. I was at the time and actual confident person, who wanted to be an emotional rock for the people in my life. My parents are concerned that I'll off myself while I finish the semester. I feel like I don't have any other choice but to be alone here but the anxiety and depression are eating at me. 8 months ago I was far from this point I had my life on track. 

During a spout of depression yesterday I came up with this:

I'm a needy person, because I want to feel desired/loved, because I don't feel that from anyone and very alone. 

I want to not be needy, so I try to put up emotional walls, but then find myself even more alone.

When I feel alone I feel more depressed and anxious.

Why do I want to feel loved/desired by others?
Because I don't think I can handle life alone.

I deal with anxiety and depression myself, so I understand what it's like, even if my issues are not as severe as his are. 

But suddenly, over the last week, things have changed. He's become much less affectionate, and when I asked him about it, he said that this is ""the real him"" and that he's actually not a very affectionate person. I feel like I'm being gaslighted, as he used to frequently ask me to come and cuddle with him, or say he wanted to hold me. Now I'm being told he is not an affectionate person? It isn't making any sense to me. 

He's scared and feels like his mental health is going to prevent him from having a relationship with anyone. We have not officially broken up, but I think it's headed that way, and I don't understand why. I don't understand what changed.

I am a 36 year old single transgender woman who is in good physical health. The last time I was released from the behavioral hospital (I was in for a week), my Discharge Diagnoses was *""Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode depressed, severe w psychosis.""*

Recently I have come to this Reddit site to learn stuff from people who are not my therapist and doctor because sometimes I am worried about telling them some of the darker things and it's still good to get an outlook from others. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem**

A deathly fear of afraid violence and rape. See, as a form of mental self-harm, I used to watch a bunch of gory videos on the internet. I've seen hours of it. Beheadings galore, people getting chopped up with saws while alive, gun executions, burnings, flayings... you name it. I don't watch that stuff anymore, but after years of doing so it has left me scared of violence. I fear all races and genders. I fear even violence on TV. It triggers me, seriously.  Sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep at night because I imagine home invaders might come in and rape and torture me. This isn't ""Oh, lol... okies"" feelings in passing. No, I legit fear this stuff. I fear MS-13 as they are a bit active in this area of the USA. I also fear random robbers. I fear NAZIS and white power groups as well as Bloods and all those guys. I'm in a city and fear getting into a fender bender and then someone gets angry and goes to kill or hurt me. I drive like a grandma! It's not just me I fear for. I live with my dad and his wife and sometimes I imagine them dying awful deaths, very vivid too.

I am a boring person. I have no friends or romantic partners and I do not hang out at clubs, parades, or other such gatherings. I am drug free. I really don't mess with people, yet just because I am transgender woman of color I sometimes fear someone will kill me. I have been sexually assaulted a number of times (mostly from boyfriends or ppl I knew), and I fear another raping so much that I just may not be able to deal with it without totally melting down and having acute mental issues that will get me  a cell in the psych ward.

I see every person in public is a potential predator. When people talk to me in public, I either straight up ignore them or tell them something like ""I'm sorry I have anxiety and can't talk.""

I lost 70lbs and I feel extremely stuck.

Hey guys. I need some insight and guidance because I am a little stuck.

Just a little background on me in hopes it maybe helps you to answer this better.. I tried for years and yeas to lose weight (tracking macros, and exercise), but kept binging, and spinning my wheels. I have always been interested in the science side of things, and I have trained several of my friends and other clients - so I had all the tools but couldn’t apply it to myself. In January 2017 though, I got into a huge fight with my old trainer who has been around since I was 13 and now I am currently 18. He was my best friend and like a brother to me. I definitely idolized him and cared about him so much. We stopped being friends over some whole drama that happened, and I felt a lot of guilt and missed him terribly. I binged like crazy, gained about 15-20 lbs in a month. I believe I began researching about medications like contrave, and things of that nature. I always thought I was ADD, but I also refused to ever get on appetite suppressants because I thought it was “cheating” and I NEEDED to do this on my own. I stumbled across a video of a doctor I think highly of making informative videos on these weight loss drugs, and I think it instilled this thought in my mind that if I were to get on something that could assist me it would change my life- now fast forward to March 2017 (about a month or so later).

I asked my mom to get me a psychiatrist appointment and I went. I ended up getting on vyvanse, topirmate and such and it has helped a TON. I counted my macros just like I did before, and did the same exercise as before. I think the high belief system in the medication, the sadness of the whole trainer situation so now I decided I guess to do it for myself, and appetite suppressant spiked the change.

I went from 282 lbs to about 212 from March 2017 to Octoberish. But now I am at a stand still, my appetite is up, and I feel like I am comfortable with where I am at. I now am somewhat friends with my old trainer again, so that should make me happy, because I wanted that bad. I am a trainer at a gym, which I always wanted. That should push me even more to change. But I feel like ALL of this is making me too comfortable. I got this job in January, so although progress stopped around October last year.. I feel like having what I want is making me to comfortable. But why is that? If my life is always going to be like this, how will I even get through it? I don’t know if something inside of me feelings like I don’t deserve to live the life I want or what. Idk..

I want to be leaner, and get to about 180ish at least, and compete in a smaller weight class for powerlifting. If I can then get leaner after that I would like that, but I want to get around there first. I know I have lost a lot already so I am capable of it…. Plus, I have all the tools to get myself there. But why can’t I just get through this??

My binging is also back, and although not as bad as it used to be, it is still pretty bad. I gained about 10 lbs from my lowest and am at 223. I was up and down about 5 lbs over the months, but I gained about 6 or so in the last month and a half. (August 4-215.8,) I find myself still sneaking some food. I want this to stop so bad.

Is this a thing with being too comfortable with what I have achieved or what? I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep binging. I considered seeing a therapist for CBT of some sort, but I just don’t know.

107,"I make this post because I am not sure how to tackle this problem properly or where to get some decent advice on how to handle the situation in a satisfactory way.

My longterm girlfriend, who i pregnant by me, has had a history of mental health issues. She is diagnosed with Borderline, which might now be a correct diagnosis though, as a later therapist suspected. She was seeing different therapists, none of which she felt could help here.

She is a person who constructs her own reality to a very large degree. She has theories about how a lot of stuff is connected in all different sorts of manners. An example might be, that she believes that every person has a soulmate and she is able to identify them.

My problem has a root in this, as she suspects me to have cheated on her some while ago. In certain moments she is absssolutely sure I did cheat on her with a friend of hers I picked up at the train station. Most of the time she realizes this is a pretty ridiculous notion, as it was winter, very cold and the way from the train station is not only short, well lit and on major streets, but also I am a very faithful guy who is madly in love with her for the majority of his adult life.

But sometimes, triggered by all sorts of different things, she gets in these ""moods"" (in lack of a better wordd, not a native speaker, sorry), and is absolutely sure I cheated on her. Then there is no arguing, no making her see it is her whateverism, in these moments it actually becomes her reality. 

There have not been any incidents in a while until 2 weeks back, when it all started again. Her reactions can range from throwing me out, hitting me to calling my mother (heck that was really shitty\^\^). It's hard for me to deal with this but not impossible but when she is in her movie (as we call it when she is well) it is very, very stressful for her which really is a problem in her pregnancy.

I'm doing my best not to portray myself as a victim, but life has kicked me around a good bit over the past few years. I'm fortunate enough to have an amazing gf, to have gotten myself into a decent job, and to be in fairly good overall health.

Thing is, sometimes, for what seems like very little reason, I get pulled into these massively dark spaces. I get depressed about the conditions of living. I take everything in like a sponge and turn it against myself. I get urges to do self-harm, though I've never really gone through with anything, and don't believe I would, but sometimes oblivion sounds so sweet. I live with a low-grade depression (it's been diagnosed and I have been on anti-depressants with mixed results before) and I also have above average anxiety. I understand these may be co-morbid with my history of epilepsy. I guess my wiring is just a little bit out of code.

While these things make my life more difficult for me than it ought to be, the real trouble is that I do a shit job of containing and processing when I'm in a spiral. I don't really have enough people to talk honestly to, and so my gf ends up receiving way more of my emotions than is fair. I lash out at myself, which is weird, I know. I often do this in the guise of talking to or texting her, but I'm actually just whipping myself in front of an audience. And it's never until after the fact that I can recognize that.

I should probably be in therapy, but between cost, time, and a general mistrust of the medical industry in general, I don't think that's likely to happen.

I grew up and currently reside in Brazil, and I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to go to college in the US or Canada and permanently move there once I'm done with my education - EVERYTHING VERY LEGAL, I EVEN HIRED LAWYERS AND AN IMMIGRATION AGENCY -. I'm very close to my family (mom and sibling) and every time I see anything about Immigrants ([like this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUeLvBFjFlM), or [this one that makes me panic every single time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFlxDuNC6OU) because I relate to it) I start balling my eyes out because I know I'll miss them so much. My hands shake and I feel very anxious and scared, specially because of my little brother (5M), who I'm going to miss the most. I feel homesick even though I'm still at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, because of The One Who Shall Not be Named, the guy currently living in the White House, I'm seeing a side of the USA that I wish I hadn't seen. When I was there a few months ago - NY and NJ, I also visited Canada (Toronto and Montreal) -, I didn't really see any xenophobia, but my stepsister - who grew up in the US - said it might be because I ""sound and look American"", due to the fact that I don't have an accent and look fairly white. But even with all of that, I'm still scared shitless of this whole situation with immigrants right now. So, of course, when I see a video or read an article involving the president of the US or anyone really who is xenophobic I get really anxious and have the same symptoms.

Depression leads to feelings of helplessness and can put us into a box that seems impossible to get out of.
We need someone to demonstrate to us that we are not really helpless, and teach us how to apply our will power to overcome difficulties.

The title is HOW TO STOP WORRYING AND START LIVING.

I’m 26F, diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD at a young age. I’m high functioning though, and most people wouldn’t have a clue unless they had seen my artwork or me on my darkest days. 

Sure, I enjoy life, and there are things that really give me happiness. Snuggling with my cat, sunny day picnics, and heartfelt hugs. But I have always been a “grass is always greener” type. I spent most of my life with chronic pain (which has lessened after a change in diet and employment), and that always dampened the moment. But even now that I am relatively healthy, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, and have an easy job that I enjoy and pays well enough, I still long for everything I’ve ever had before or have never even had in the first place. 

Though I love my city, I long for a life I’ve never had in a city I fell in love with while traveling in the Netherlands. Though I love my job, I long for the jobs I’ve had in the past, even though I hated them at the time. Though I love my husband, I long to be alone. It’s like every memory I have is rose tinted and coated in warm and fuzzy nostalgia, no matter if times were hard or easy, no matter if I was on top of the world or underneath it. Every song reminds me of “better days”, every beautiful sunny day reminds me of another supposedly better day I had in the sun. 

I can’t escape this pervasive sense of loss and nostalgia for days past, and can’t ever be completely satisfied with the present. There is always something there gnawing... chewing... writhing in the back of my mind. Telling me that I’ve already been the happiest I’ll ever be, and I wasted it because I didn’t recognize it in the moment, and I’ll never even remember what it was. 

I guess I’m just looking to see if anyone feels anything similar, or if this is just the regular human experience.

119,"I don’t expect anyone to reply to this, but I just wanted to talk about my feelings somewhere, because I have nobody to discuss them with. 

I hate myself. I have no sense of self worth and I think I’m a loser. Sometimes I feel helpless and I project this deep hatred for myself into my friendships and relationships. I patiently wait for the day when the penny drops and everybody realizes that my life is a lie, and in that moment everyone realizes that I am stupid. 

I’ve felt this way for at least 3 years. It comes and goes, but I know it’s always in the back of my mind. 

I find it impossible to share my feelings, even with
the people I am closest to. I struggle to articulate my feelings, but it’s mostly because I do not feel comfortable sharing this information with anyone. I have been told that I am difficult to read, and this is because I bury my emotions and feelings very, very, deep within me. When I am extremely happy, or extremely depressed, my tone and facial expressions are the same. I’ve once had someone be visibly surprised when they seen me smile, i guess because they thought this was unusual for me. Overall I am just a negative person. I am an introvert. 

I have lost most of my friends. Nobody knows the real me. Heck, nobody wants to know the “fake” me which I project to the world, so they sure as hell don’t want to know the real me. The person I am on the surface, and the person I am inside my head, are two COMPLETELY different people. 

I have trust issues. I have no real hobbies and no meaningful friendships anymore. I have so much thoughts and feelings built up inside me and I am so alone that i can’t even share them. As a result, the problem just keeps getting bigger. 

Probably my biggest problem is I do not think I deserve happiness. I see happiness as a luxury that I deserve only every once in a while- like a pizza or junk food. On a normal, average day, I am just plain old miserable, which has become my normal.

The girl I love is on the other side of the world. My life is miserable. ",18Oct2018,1
120,"For maybe 2 months now, I’ve felt really disgusted by food. I can’t stand the taste or feeling of food in my mouth. Anything I eat, I basically shovel into my mouth to get it over with as fast as possible. I usually only eat once a day and then maybe a small snack. Some days I eat twice. I am rapidly losing weight. I have gone from 138 to 120. I’m not trying to lose weight, I just can’t stop. Food is no longer enjoyable to me. I don’t think about eating really. I think I forget sometimes completely and that’s why I end up eating once. I started a new anxiety medication about 3 months ago, but it’s not an every day thing, I only take it when I feel super panicky or if I know tomorrow is gonna be stressful then I take it before bed. I was on antidepressants earlier this year for maybe 2 months, but then I stopped them because I didn’t like the way they made me feel. So I don’t really think the medications have anything to do with this change in appetite. But I have no idea what to do. I know I should probably go to the doctor but I have no idea when I’ll get the chance to because of work and money. ",18Oct2018,1
121,"I'm not exactly sure what context i can even give here aside from, I don't remember. I don't really know how long it's been going on either. But every time I'm around my friends I become painfully aware of it. Interactions will usually go like this:

Friend(s): Makes some sort of inside joke, or references something that we did together.

Me: Looking confused.  
Friend(s): You don't remember when \*insert more context to the Thing\*

Me, Outwardly: Oh yeah haha right. I remember.  
Me, Inwardly: I have no recollection of this whatsoever.

And it's not like, minor events that just slipped my mind either, it's big things, like going to someones birthday party, or school dances and other events, or how i met them, or something big they told me. There's even some whole people I totally forget about or what they like, why we are friends to begin with. The only thing that's left is recognizing their face and the feel of being friends and that they are a person I care deeply about somehow. And it's getting much worse.

I think the first time i realized this happening was when one of my friends reached out to me because i posted on fb about having car troubles and she offered to fix it for me, but the whole time i was there while she was fixing it I realized she might as well be a stranger to me. She kept bringing up things we did and stuff that happened in high school that I had no memory of. (And I'm only 20 now, so high school as a whole was not that long ago.)  
Most recently was last weekend going to my best friends birthday party. Someone I have known since I was 12 ish, and I struggled to get her a gift because I couldn't remember what she liked (Something i should definitely know by now) and when I got there she talked about things I knew we'd done before but I just couldn't seem to grasp or actually remember them. I ended up drinking and dissociating the rest of the party just to manage to be there and then left early.  
I wish I knew what was happening to me. But I don't. I thought the bad migraines i've been having in the front of my head and like right behind my eyes could have been a cause, and I had what I thought was a stroke about two and a half weeks ago and went to the er, but both an mri and a cat scan showed nothing so i got sent home after I regained mobility. The doctors didn't really offer any advice either other than to take it easy and not stress out. Doesn't help much though when I have this and so much more to be stressed about.  


tldr: I can't remember important events or anything about people close to me and I'm scared.",18Oct2018,1

123,"So I attend my local-ish nami meeting off and on. At the last meeting I attended we finally got an official moderator after having a temp fill in for months. 

She introduced herself by saying she was bipolar and borderline. I can’t speak for her being bipolar but FUCK she is the stereotype of borderline. The entire meeting was a framework for her to talk about herself and her life. I could seriously give you a 45 minute run down on where she lives and works and her thoughts on everything and everyone and how much she pays for rent and the drugs she does medication she’s on etc...

She isn’t new to nami, she used to have a paid position with them, and she isn’t new to moderating because she used to lead a different group. But she was really inappropriate and unbelievably self centered. She turned every discussion and comment back to herself. 
I get it- it’s nami, people have mental health issues. That’s the point. But she was...yeah.

It’s pointless to complain to nami because it’s a volunteer position and they’ve had her for so long I think the local office is kind of “deaf” to her. Like they’re so used to her they can’t see it. 
I’m going to give the meeting another try just to see if she was having a very manic/very borderline day, I hope that’s the case, but if not I’m done with that meeting. ",18Oct2018,1
124,"I have my psych eval tomorrow. Sheesh. The anxiety is already building and building...  


Y'all know what happens when my anxiety begins to build up. Ah this is NOT a good time for that to come out. The family is all here. I can hold it off and distract myself, hopefully until I go to bed. Then when I am on my walk tomorrow, I can let it loose a little bit. It can run free for a little while and I will feel better.  


Sorry to be posting SO much lately, but there are a lot of changes going on in my life right now and I have nowhere else to turn.   


This isn't a negative, upset post, however. Just...worried and a bit scared, and extremely anxious.  


POSITIVE: I get to take my Clonidine (for anxiety) soon and that mellows me out big time. It also allows me to sleep soundly--at least for a few hours. Gotta LOVE insomnia ha ha.

125,"I wasn't sure in which subreddit should i post this.  I'm on vacation with my high school (17 year olds) Today as i went up the stairs after party i saw a girl i know from before lying on stairs, shaking and talking to herself. I asked her Hey! Hey!  Are you okay? She hasn't responded so i asked her again. Then i came infront of her.  She said yeah don't worry it happens often. (She was shaking but talking calmly and her voice was much higher than usually) I asked her should i call someone, and she said no, she didn't look normally so i started panicking i went to reception of the hotel. And she said something to me I couldn't understand. I called my class teacher explained her what happened. And at that moment same girl walked next to us acting completely normal. Also i think i should say that she often tells us about other universes in her head, and how she has made an alter ego for each one of us. Could this be a sign of mental illness?  Should i be worried? What's the next step i should take? Honestly i am really worried about my safety since she knows i saw her in that state.  ",18Oct2018,1

My friend I’m staying with is about to move on Wednesday. The place doesn’t accept dogs but her dog is a therapy dog. 

Her therapist hasn’t been responding to any calls, texts, emails - and my friend needs the therapy dog verification letter or else she can’t move to this new place. She’s bipolar so she’s handling this very poorly. I’ve tried to call the hospital but it’s after hours; anyone I’ve reached just immediately transferred me to the answering machine without hearing me out. We’re gonna try to go to the hospital tomorrow. But in the meantime, is there anything else we can do or show the real estate agent to prove she needs this dog?? It’s really upsetting her and I’m afraid for her. 

Bonus question, how do I comfort my friend?? She’s losing her mind. Thanks.",18Oct2018,1
127,"I’m from Toronto and I’m looking for another psychiatrist. Mine and my family doctor aren’t helping me. My psychiatrist said if I’m still getting suicidal feelings it’s something I have to figure out with therapy but I find the therapy more helpful than the meds. Sure I’ve had slight improvements but no where near the negatives. This is my 4-5th antidepressant since I was 14-15 I’m now 25. I’ve been tested for other things too.

128,"I am traveling for work this week. The second time in the past three. I’ve had a lot of time to sit by myself and think. I lost my brother to suicide over six years ago. Not a day goes by where I don’t think of him. The sharpness is grief is gone. But there will always be a hole that cannot be filled. 

I was sitting in my hotel room the other evening and I had a day dream about him. His face was clear as day but he was oddly unfamiliar. More unfamiliar than he had ever been to me before. It was jarring. 

This morning, on the way to the Metro, Table for Glasses by Jimmy Eat World came on and I’m thankful for the cold wind to blame. We used to skip out of church as soon as we could to run to the car and sing that song.
