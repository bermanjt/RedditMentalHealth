3,"Officially I'm diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, however I feel my symptoms are closer to bipolar or schizoaffective disorder. Before I decide to pressure my psychiatrist about this, I wanted to hear the opinions of some other people.

OK, so first, my mood is quite cyclic. For several days, I'm super cheerful and hyper, then I kinda crash into suicidal depression for several weeks before climbing back up again. From what I understand, BPD mood swings tend to be far more rapid and random, whereas bipolar and schizoaffective is more cyclic and predictable (like mine are).

Second, I suffer from paranoid delusions. I know BPD can suffer from delusions, but they are often short and based on reality. Mine are usually long lasting and bizarre. For example, I believed I was possessed by demons, and needed to stab myself with an ice cold knife to kill them, and that stabbing myself would not harm me. This delusion lasted for several months, and I only realised how insane it was after being on antipsychotics for awhile.

Thirdly, I experience hallucinations. I often hear voices, usually commanding me to do things, however the psychiatrist believes these are pseudo-hallucinations rather than genuine hallucinations. I've also seen people and animals that aren't there; often not realising they are hallucinations until someone points out there's nothing there. I'm unsure what hallucinations are like for BPD sufferers; I'm aware it's possible.

Finally, antipsychotics have helped stabilise my paranoia and reduced the intensity of the voices significantly, however I still occasionally have moments when I get very ill. These often only last for a few weeks or a month before recovering, unlike having permanent symptoms when off antipsychotics. From what I understand, BPD tends to respond better to therapy than medication, but I (and my friends) consider medication a complete necessity to me being well, considering how much more stable I am on it.

Anyway, as I said previously, I intend to discuss this with my psychiatrist as soon as I see them, however I would greatly appreciate your thoughts beforehand.",24Feb2018,2
4,"Just went through a situation where yet again I've been criticized multiple times for not understanding directions, multiple times. It REALLY doesn't feel good for my self esteem. I'm trying to listen and learn, but literally can't get what it is they want from me. I need visual demonstrations and examples in order to learn new things, not just orders. I think all my life I have to some degree tuned people out on purpose, because I can't stand hearing people talk, and then it just sort of became habit. I'd rather daydream and then figure things out myself, or have it SHOWN TO ME.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Has anyone else been made to feel stupid and slow, time and time again, because they don't listen well, or can't even comprehend verbal directions? I know I'm smart in many areas. People have told me as much. I hate people who try to make me feel stupid and worthless. Like angry bosses who don't know how to train their employees, nor care, then get mad at them for not knowing everything.",24Feb2018,3
6,"I have been going to therapy for a couple years now. I started going when I was 15, it's been pretty much the same since. 

So basically I've been through 4 therapists, not that I have any issues with any of them... I first started therapy because my school found out that I was self harming and wanted me to seek help. They set me up with someone and it just went from there. The first one I had for almost 3 years, usually she would talk most of our sessions because I couldn't find anything to say or talk about because I'm extremely  bad at that. The second one I had was really nice, she was sweet, understanding and very accommodating. I didn't really see her for that long tho. Anyways up to my most recent therapists.... basically I've been seeing this woman for a couple months now, I've been seeing her through a community health center, through the sexual assault response team. Anyways she is amazing, probably  one of my favorite therapists to date. I've been seeing her since maybe July of last year? I don't remember. Anyways she went on Maternity  leave so I have been seeing someone else for a few months now. She's amazing and a really good replacement kinda for me??

Anyways since I started therapy I've had alot of issues talking about my feelings, my first therapist went well for a while and I could open up but a couple years later I started to become more distant and it was around a really hard time for me. I confided with her with some really dark shit and I guess I just felt a little ashamed. She went away to school a little bit after. 

Her replacement  was nice. She made me feel super comfortable I just didn't know how to act... I wouldn't really talk even tho I wanted to and I just couldn't find the words to say. I saw her for about 2-3 months.

My next therapist was one of the most recent ones. I opened up to her about something really big in my life and I completely  broke down in front of her which I have never done before. I feel like she's seen a really dark side of me and heard alot of my problems but she's on mat leave now. Sometimes I don't know what to talk about so I ramble for a bit and I just keep repeating myself. It's a vicious cycle. 

Anyways, to the most recent one who I've been seeing for about a month or two now.... I want to change it. It's been getting kind of repetitive with me I guess. I only try to talk about the good things and I try to not talk about the bad things until the end of our sessions. I desperately want to change that.... I don't want to end up feeling like I got nothing from a therapy session at the end of it because I really like my therapist. She is really supportive and has really good insight, I want to stop being  like this. 

Lol anyways enough backstory... I just want to know if anyone is going through the same issues or has gone through the same issues.... I really don't want to avoid my problems anymore and I'm  going to therapy for a reason... I just don't know how to talk about my feelings openly because I feel really awkward about it  but I don't want to anymore. Any tips would be greatly appreciated",24Feb2018,1

I need actual advice on the best combination of pills with or without alcohol to die on. 

Please advice. I’m desperate. ",24Feb2018,0
9,"I am 27 years old and have had two stays in mental hospitals. Currently I am not taking any medication and havent had any complaints from my family. I live at home with my parents and younger sister. I believe I may be ""on the spectrum"" but I don't have health insurance or resources to find out. The more research I do the more I believe I have been dealing with this problem my whole life.

I was going to go to the UW Adult Autism clinic months ago when I was still covered by Washingtons ""Apple Care"" that was given to me when I left the hospital but they wouldn't cover it. I have a job working a flying trapeze rig in Seattle but I don't work enough hours (only 18 a week) to get health benefits from that employer. I often think about quitting the job I really enjoy (when I'm there) just because I cant sleep the nights before I have to work. I lay in bed imagining myself on the trapeze and my heart starts racing like I am actually flying or instructing.

 I think about getting work at QFC just to get health insurance but I am crippled with anxiety over the change in my schedule of eat,sleep, play video games. I haven't told anyone but I often have thoughts of suicide. I don't have any plans to but I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. I want help but I don't want to worry my parents any more. They know I haven't been sleeping well but that's all.",24Feb2018,2
10,"Long story short I was raped over the course of a year when I was 10-11 by two men.

I have been through a decade of therapy and am medicated Venlafaxine 37.5mg down from 230mg a year ago. I was also on anti-psychotics for awhile I had panic attacks and visual and auditory hallucinations which I (mostly) don't have anymore. At least not to the degree I used to.

Anywho....I have been bisexual since I went through puberty, right after the sexual abuse ended. 

Without trying to sound gross or overly detailed I self harmed by inflicting anal pain on myself, had gay hook ups with random men without condoms. Always was the bottom. I have been tested btw and I am luckily not infected with any std's. I also have had several romantic/intimate boyfriends so not all of my gay contacts were negative.

So fast forward to today and I am married to a wonderful and beautiful woman. I love her soooo much!! She knows everything about me too about my past. 

However I still have periods of time the same as always where I get this intense desire for gay sex and male intimacy. During these periods I also have self harm desire which I dont mostly act upon, I get depressed, and my personality changes to a more effeminate me and I have to make a conscious effort to not be that way. Like my whole persona changes from my head to my toes, the way I walk, talk, think, speak, even how I will unconsciously stand at a counter buying whatever I notice it is distinctly effeminate. 

The  POP one day it stops and I'm back to 'normal'. Which lasts for a few months at a time usually.


So there it is. I hope someone else can relate or share or just talk. ",24Feb2018,1
12,"Does anyone else try to meet up with their family, and they get angry at you because you've unintentionally ""screwed up"" their day because of your mood? But then, you don't even know if it was your fault? 

Today I agreed to meet my family for coffee and tried to get them to tell me where they were going. It took me 4 phone calls to figure out where they were, because they weren't sure where exactly they wanted to go. In the end they agreed to meet in a little cul-de-sac at the end of a very long street that took me forever to find. They had already ordered my coffee for me which was cold by the time i got there.

I tried to explain that it is really frustrating when they don't tell me exactly where they are and i have to go and find them in a big city (the traffic on weekends is insane!) and have to walk through about 20 coffee shops in town, just to find out that they are about to leave when I get there. On top of this, they either tell me to hurry up so they can leave or they will have asked the people working to reheat my coffee for me a few times. 

This naturally makes me cranky, and then I get the whole ""we don't need your negativity"" speech which really pisses me off, and then I get told I'm not allowed to visit them any more because I've stressed them out. 

This is only one example of many. It may only seem like a coffee, but I constantly get lured into these situations thinking that they actually want to see me, and then they turn on me in the most unique ways... ",24Feb2018,1
13,"My mother dealt with betrayal from my father for years. However this was done with 6 years ago and we all moved on. During the last 12 years an issue of my mother being bitter/depressed has been happening simaltaneously. Initially we thought it was depression and a few years ago it probably was. But now over the last few years it’s mostly been bitterness towards my father. She’ll go weeks without speaking to him sometimes for no good reason. She’ll be nice for half a day then it goes back to being distant and cold. This has led to them almost getting a divorce and she says she will change but it’s sometjing she’s said over and over and over and so she’ll be happy for a few days then come the mood swings again. She says she can handle it on her own but clearly she can’t and she’s in denial. It’s driving me crazy because I can’t tell whether or not she just doesn’t feel herself. I’ve been trying to get her to see a therapist but she refuses. She briefly saw one before but stopped as she thinks it’s useless and a waste of money. 

Is this depression? Atypical depression? Keep in mind she’s not fatigued or unmotivated or sleeps all day. Would a cognitive behavioural therapist be able to help?",24Feb2018,1
14,I recently developed OCD kinda thing (not sure if that's so) and I can't control my anger sometimes and get worked up for no reasons. I'm having frustrations regularly and I'm adamant to prove I'm right. Like I was not like this before. I used to ignore fights and complications but recently I seem to indulge more into it. I'm lacking some mental peace. I can't visit any psychiatrist right now because there are medical complications in the house. I started going out for walks more often and Idk if that helps but I guess it's help to reduce some frustrations. I'm having exams in about 2 months and I don't seem to like to study even for the same reason. Any advice would be helpful. ,24Feb2018,1

17,"I stayed in my works office for a good ten minutes before gathering myself enough to get back to work. I rocked and hugged myself saying I did the right thing or everything’s okay just trying to remove the negativity of people stealing, yelling at you for whatever reason or simply being rude when you’re trying to help them. I was crying and just felt defeated though I was trying to stay calm and sane but their words get to me. I feel irrational anger when the laugh as they still or become rude when you’re following rules you didn’t make. How can one feel okay with this?

I am making this post because I can do so anonymously and was wanting to see if anyone would be interested in studying me out or asking questions they have always wanted to know about psychos.

27,"I have never been to a counsellor before, although I have been struggling with mental health since I was 8.

When I was 8 I developed many compulsive routines, tapping routines, turning light switches on and off a certain amount of times, not getting right arm wet in shower etc because I believed that my family would die if I did not do them. This went on for about a year until the routines became so long and obvious that I could no longer hide them. At the time I had no idea what was wrong with me, but I knew that what I was doing was very weird. It was a huge struggle but I basically managed to tell myself I was being irrational and go cold turkey on my main tapping routine that I did in public, and over the next few years I slowly got rid of other small routines and weird behaviors which had become so automatic I didn't realise I was doing them.

When I was about 9 after I got rid of my main tapping routine, I decided I was fat, in about 6 months I lost 9 kilograms. People started noticing and commenting that I was skinny and so I decided I had to stop as I couldn't hide it any longer.

I have been extremely shy as long as I can remember, I can't even begin to explain the endless social situations that make me feel anxious on a daily basis. I have always been known as the most quiet, awkward and shy person in any group, I completely freeze and withdraw from most conversations in groups, speaking to new people is nerve wracking, I feel uncomfortable in public like I am always being judged etc. 

Because of this I had a very difficult time making friends, in particular during years 7 and 8 in school. Through year 7 I had 1 very close friend in my year level who I would feel terrified if I had to go to a class without her, or if she was absent for a few days. At the end of year 7 we had a falling out which left me with no one I felt comfortable around at school, as well as being bullied. This made me terrified of going to school to the point that I somehow found my way out of going 2-3 days per week for the entire year, I would also fake being sick for weeks at a time as well as actually getting sick way more often and for longer than I usually would. I felt extremely depressed, this was my first time ever experiencing such a strong negative emotion for such a long period of time (the whole year) and so I didn't realise that this feeling was not going to last forever, I thought that if this is how I am going to feel the rest of my life then what is the point in living, I wasn't going to kill myself in the near future, but I really wanted to be killed by something else.

I moved schools in year 9, somehow made a solid friendship group and was never bullied once more. However ever since that time I have had unexplained periods of feeling that depressed feeling again, either for weeks or a couple of months. During these periods I lose motivation, lose my appetite, want to sleep all the time, although have a lot of trouble falling or staying asleep, cry at least once or sometimes all through the day if there is no one around, want to go out to distract myself, but can't stay out too long because I can't hold my emotions together long in public. It gets in the way of productivity, I take hours to get small tasks done because I can't stop crying. Luckily these periods only occur a few times a year, and a lot of the time I do not feel like this at all, although I dread the next time it will happen again.

Currently I am in a good mood, although it is getting concerning to me that it is time to get some help, mainly for my extreme shyness since my future career requires good communication skills which are currently impaired.

I have not gotten help before because before I was about 12 I had no idea that what I was experiencing were potentially mental health issues, and by the time I learned about mental health I thought I had mainly fixed myself (stopping compulsions and losing weight). My anxiety in social situations has been a part of my personality my whole life and so I think it has just become normal to me, although I doubt it should be, I improve very slowly every year and so have not gotten help hoping that it will disappear over the years, but I am sick of being embarrassed by it being so obvious to everyone around me, and to it impairing my function in everyday social situations. I have never gotten help other than talking to a school counsellor about irrelevant issues hoping he would magically guess and help because I hate the idea of anyone being worried about me, I feel guilty about having such bad feelings, as well making drama.

I sound like a complete emotional disaster after saying all of this haha, and I have never told anyone any of this. I am physically able to function most of the time, it is just not always easy and people probably think I am a bit weird.

I have no idea how to explain all of this to the counsellor, I think that it is important that I do though, I am feeling worried about my first appointment.

Tips, advice and reassurance would be very appreciated .",24Feb2018,1
28,"First off, this is a throw away account so that hopefully no one I know figures out who left this. Secondly, I want everyone to know that Im stable and safe, and actively seeking a diagnosis. Finally, I get a little artsy with the way I arrange my words at times, but it feels like it helps illustrate my point kind of?  oh, and one more thing. A couple of the entries are mp3 recordings because I though it would be easier to talk about things, but turns out I was wrong, and went back to writing.

33,"I scare myself because of how I react to things now.

I accidentally dropped my vacuum down the stairs, and just stared at it. My mom was yelling, saying how I could've broken it, and that thought had crossed my mind, and I just thought 'if it's broken, can't do anything about it now', and felt no remorse for dropping it.

I spill things all the time, and have no reaction. I just wipe it up and continue on with my day. 

Worse of all, my grandfather was recently diagnosed with cancer. I felt like I had to fake the reaction to be sad. The only thought going through my mind was 'this is how he's gonna die, we all die someday anyway.'
Afterwards, I felt horrible for thinking that. Why can't I actually be sad? 
It feels like all my emotions are bottling up, and I don't know how to release them.

One side of me has no remorse for anything I do. The other half of me is constantly worried and guilty about the impact of the things I do. It feels like I'm being torn apart by the two extremes.

My emotions are so dulled now. It's like they're slowly fading away, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

I get so easily jealous, too. There's this girl whom I love more than anything, and she's just so perfect and amazing and real and everything I want to be, that I feel like I have to protect her from everything. But as soon as she hangs out with someone else, I feel so angry at noone, and completely worthless.

34,"For a long time I felt like I am struggling in life, in having my slice of normalicy. Sometimes I feel like my best efforts are not good enough, or are just enough to get by. When these hit my mind, these are the bad days. 

On the good days i feel like life is pretty good but a part of me just hopes it stays that way, and continues to improve (life goals:house, kids, etc)

Between the two mentalities, I have tried to take control of my life more, make changes and work hard to make things better. In some ways this works and some things have gotten better.

However, I overworry, micromanage, and try to control everything to keep from slacking. I feel like I have to keep pretty constantly on point to just keep thing from falling apart. 

Best description, it feels like I am walking on a frozen lake. Sometimes the ice gets thicker and I am fine for a while. But then things thaw a little and then days come where I am just waiting for the ground beneath my feet to give way, and I will be struggling to keep my head above water again.

I dont want to live with this constant fear of things falling apart, this constant exaustion from never being sure if I am relaxed or avoidant, or the feel that all life will be such a constant stuggle.

Has anyone felt just like this? How do I stop watching for the signs and trying to control things? How do I let go, when I am scared to drown?

38,"Hello everyone. My problem consists in following... i was cruel to animals when i was 6-9 years old. To one particular animal, actually, to lizard. 
I clearly remember that i threw a lizard that i had caught towards a neighbor's lawn... Did i do it for fun? I hope not... Because i didn't understand that lizards were living beings that feel? I really want to believe it.

But my most crippling, most devastating flashback is that i...guillotined a lizard. But i'm not sure. I'm quite sure i wasn't alone, someone should've ""helped"" me, but still... I remember its severed head with closed eyes, but i do not remember blood. I cannot imagine if i really did it, it just smashes me. I am crying, nevertheless i feel that i...pretend. I really, really want to be sure i'm crying because i repent. As i wrote, i cannot imagine if i was able to do that, because now when i think of it, i shiver. This is something... unbelievable to me. I cannot live with it, it plagues me.
 
The only thing i want to know is am i still so cruel? I try imagining situations when an animal is in trouble, i try to predict my reaction, would i be outraged, would i feel compassion? I have a cat, i love him (i hope), and it loves me (i hope). The same is with my parents, sometimes i think i don't love them, so i try imagining situations when they need my help. Would i respond? Of course, i would... that's what my brain is telling me. But does it tell what i hope to hear? I'm really scared. I think that i felt a lot and now i'm just dead on emotions. I fear i will torture animals again or even people. When i think of that, i do not want to exist.

I have anxiety disorder, i had panic attacks, i've been in hospital for 1 month because of that. I have obsessive thoughts, suicidal, blasphemous and cruel in particular that ruin my happiness, i had rituals and i still have to some extent (i used to listen to the same song before going to sleep for two years, i used to collect rubbish and some others).

I would use suicidal thoughts as a way to get them to pay attention to me or do things my way. At the time I wasn't even aware what I was doing was abusive. I didn't think about what it did to them.

41,"Hopefully this is right sub I can post this. 
I will say that having severe anxiety sucks. For the past 2 years, have been the best &amp; worst time of my life. In May 2016 is when I graduated from high school. Then after high school is where my life just went down hill from there and my anxiety skyrocketed. I was very clueless about how the real world works and didn’t know who I was as person and wasn’t really sure what independence was. Most of my life was very depressing and anxiety inducing for me as I was very lonely, bullied, shy, quiet and friendless. I was very unhappy. I had a lot issues and still do to this day. As of recently I found out that I’ve been suffering and going through withdrawal from “Maladaptive Daydreaming” 24/7. I want to say that was the root cause of my life long anxiety problem that shaped who I am today. I wished I didn’t daydream so much back then, I didn’t realize how bad this it was until now when I think about it. I had major breakdown back in July 2016 where my life changed BIG time where it changed me as person and still don’t feel like myself to this day.

Currently right now in my life I’m working a full time job. 

I am in need of help. My communication (when comes to socializing) has definitely gotten worse after high school since I am alone just about all the time now, as it shows in this post. I just go to work and come home.  Within the last 7 months I’ve only went to a socialize event 2 times and hung out with a couple people from work only 2 times to.
I’m not very well known to this Earth. Not a lot of people know me. I’m not really sure how to talk people anymore. I been keep my distance from people and staying silent for the last year because of how severe my anxiety (been giving me irrational thoughts along with other issues) is. I will admit it has been giving me thoughts of suicide, but don’t have any intentions to do so. 

This week is where I’m actually starting to open up.

I’m not really sure if anyone can really help (I understand as this a unique situation), 
I wish I was happy, been having a hard time making myself happy. 

There is a lot more to this post than I’m sharing and don’t want it to be too much for anyone, it’s NOT my intention for it to be. If anyone genuine wants to know more, I can share with you. 
I’m not really expecting much from this. I just need to vent in the best way I can.

43,"My boyfriend had quite the affair in 2015 and I've been having really awful nightmares about it ever since. They all start the same, I'm at the same house, I start to scream and shout while I watch him kiss another girl or fall in love with her, and then I run out into the wilderness. I also have recurring dreams about people I love dying. They're all extremely vivid and I always feel low the morning afterward. What can I do to stop this? It comes in waves, sometimes I don't dream at all, other times I go through periods where I'm up 5 times a night crying because it was just so traumatising. Thank you in advance.

44,"Yeah I know what it’s like. To feel, like noone understands how much pain you’re in. The constant pain of suffocating. 

One way to describe is that it’s like drowning. You’re in the ocean and you go under water and you loose your breath. But instead of surfacing, you’re sinking deeper and deeper, something tied to your leg dragging you down as you try desperately to swim upwards. 

That sickening feeling like you’re never going to make it. Never going to see the surface. Trying to breathe when there’s no air and when every breath makes you choke and your entire body is kicking, screaming for help, but nobody is coming for you,  because nobody sees you. And nobody cares. 

Sometimes, for the really lucky ones, the weight gets lighter. And you can swim to shore to get a few breaths. Most people sit comfortably on sandy beaches smiling and laughing, whilst your idea of happiness is lasting just a little longer above water. 

Now in the physical world, when you drown like this, you die within minutes. But in your mind, you can suffer like this for years without dying. Until of course, the eventual goodbye that comes to all minds gone insane from perpetual drowning. 

Suicide. A beautiful thing. We all die eventually. Why not just do it sooner? Why not end the pain when there’s no hope. 


Just shut up and feel better they say. Exercise they say. And you do. You exercise, you watch entertainment, you spend time with family, you eat the best foods on earth. You study. But for your own reasons, you can’t seem to be happy. Ever. And the first few days are ok. And the first few weeks are hell. And the first few months are unbearable. And the years that follow… Well. They kinda make you wanna die. You’ve taken all the pills. You’ve done the therapy. And nothing works. And you ask yourself, do people really expect me to continue living? And when people say yes and call you a coward for wanting to take your own life because you’ve been suffering for years, it makes you boil with unspeakable anger. Ironically this anger quickly turns to sadness at how cruel the world is, which only makes you more suicidal. So, by the sheer arrogance and ignorance of some people, they have only accelarated your death, not helped it in any way. 

And they think, good riddance. We didn’t need weak people like you. You don’t deserve to live if you just complain about every single thing in life. You’re so lucky. You should be grateful. And on and on it goes, numbing your brain until english words no longer make any sense. 

And you know, healthy people, they see this and they think what the fuck is wrong with those cruel idiots? But for someone who is in pain, they won’t fight. They will crawl into a corner and think yes you’re right, I’m weak, and I should die. 

And sometimes, I’m grateful for those cruel people. They make it easier to attempt suicide. To end life and enter the peaceful bliss of death. 

What I hate, are the people who tell you not to. The people who cry. The people who somehow love you. Not every sufferer is heartless. Of course they don’t want to purposefully cause another person distress or harm. 

But think of it this way. In order to keep these sitting comfortably on the shore, you have to stay under water. You have to drown for them. And again, human beings are tough. Idiots think you can endure such pain indefinitely. Yes. Yes you can. For the first few weeks. For the first few months. But then a year passes. And then two. And then three. And then a decade. And then finally these very people you have tried to keep happy will leave you alone, totally forgetting about you as if you never existed. And in a state of overwhelming shock, the only reaction you could have is that emoji with the smile and the sweat on the forehead. 

You have suffered. For absolutely nothing. 

“Wow.” You say. A gross understatement and reflection of your current state of mind. 

At that point. You’d rather someone shot you with a thousand bullets. Or break your bones in a thousand places, then go through the hell you are going through now. 

And even as I write these words, they will always fail in making people understand the pain. No matter what I say or do. A little bit like trying to explain colours to the blind. 

Nobody gets it. Nobody understands. I want to die. I want to die. Kill me please. Let me die. Let me die. Just please let me die. I wish to suffer no more. I wish to suffer no more. If you have a knife, stab me. If you have a gun, shoot me. If you have a rope, strangle me. If you have a club, beat me to death. But do it quick. So the pain goes away. Because dead people don’t suffer. 

But wait. Ah, but my religion tells me I will suffer, I will go to hell. So I should just suffer now for my entire life. Oh well, I guess I will. But everyday I will think, “please let me die”. Everyday whilst children pray for toys and gifts, I will be praying for a truck to hit me or lightning to strike. At least I’ll go to heaven one day. That will be my bliss.

Or… Well I’m not sure. I don’t know if there’s a heaven. I tell people I believe, but deep down there’s doubt. My parents were religious. But me…? Do I seriously believe in a heaven. So much so I’m willing to suffer for decades? It makes me think. What if my religion told me to walk on glass barefoot everyday or else I’d go to hell. Is it possible for a human to believe that so much he will actually follow it whole heartedly for decades of his life? 

Maybe. But am I that kind of person? I guess we’ll see when my friends and family find me hanging tied to a rope. 

Then they’ll see whether I was a true believer or not.

But fuck it. God let his own creation suffer. In no world or universe would I ever do that to my own child. So God can go fuck himself in the ass. And I hope he exists. And I hope he puts me in hell. Because if I was ever put in heaven, and if I was able to maintain who I am and my identity, then all the dumb shit God can conjure up for me will never relieve me of the anger I have for him, and the sadness I already harbor. For the times I was abused and mistreated, I will be looking at the person who caused all that pain everyday of my life whilst he bribes the shit out of me with mansions and giant chocolate cakes or unicorns or whatever the fuck he thinks I want. No God, I don’t want your dumb materialistic shit. I’d like it very much if you released all the poor souls in hell who’ve done bad things cus they were sick in their heads either because you designed their genes to be so or because they were so fucked and traumatised by the society you helped create that they were driven to do insane things. And what do you do? You punish them. Most parents punish their children so that they will behave. So that they will be better. You punish yours for no such reason. You punish them for the sake of it. And then you leave them in your torture chamber for eternity. Eternity is a long fucking time god. A long fucking time. What sort of moral education are you trying to give those people hmm? I wonder if you even are aware of the pain they’re in. Oh nope because I remember, you’re utterly not made of us. You are an entirely separate being. They made that clear in the teachings. We were made in your image but we are strictly not a part of you. Pathetic. You don’t even know the pain you’re inflicting on people. 

Oh what’s that? Torturing the people so that others can learn to behave better? Right. Because people need to behave better in heaven where they can do whatever they want which was what you promised. What’s that? It was to make people behave better on earth? Right, because your holy teachings touched the ears of every single human being. There TOTALLY weren’t billions of humans in history unaware of your very existence. 

So God, if by some miracle countering logic, you exist. Then put me in fucking hell please because it will not matter whether I’m in heaven or hell. Because I’d probably go so insane in heaven from trauma that such an evil monstrous being exists that I will lost my identity and no longer be aware of space or time. And if I was in hell the same thing would occur. If you are even crueler than the teachings show, then by some evil magic you will try and make us aware of our suffering, forever, regardless if we are in hell and heaven. Thereby manipulating that which makes us who we are, our very consciousness. 

Well, at least if I’m in hell, I get to spit in your face, and attain some relief knowing I’m with my fellow sufferers instead of abandoing them up there in heaven rolling in sex and cakes, like a selfish asshole who ironically seriously does not deserve to be up in heaven if he can be content everyday knowing there are people suffering in torture chambers for as long as time exists. 

So yeah, fuck you God. If you were a person I would have stabbed you, mutilated you, and hung and quarter you like in the medieval ages. I would never do that even the people who’ve abused me. Fucking hitler doesn’t deserve that. But you? I wouldn’t even hesitate. Call it a desperate attempt at saving humanity from a supernatural all powerful all knowing ominpresent evil entity if you will. No wonder the devil exists. Like father like son. 

So yeah, religion may or may not save you from killing yourself. Depending on how deeply you question your faith. And if it does save you. And if you’ve never given a damn about the flaws in your religion, then hey, at least you’re alive. Which is obviously, to the sufferer, a bad thing. 

But if you do have doubts, then in simple terms: you’re fucked. 

And it’s not a question of whether or not you will kill yourself. But a question of how long will fear and hope keep you alive? 

Some make it to a few decades and suddenly a miracle occurs and their life changes and they become happy. The 1%. And most will never find happiness. Because even normal healthy people will tell you: life is not easy. The universe will not give you what you want. Even if you put in the effort and work. 

It boils down to luck. And your survival depends on your odds at making life not suck. 

But ask yourself. If you were a gambler. And you knew your odds were 1 to a million. Would you keep going? 

To live. To gamble. It’s pretty stupid. Yet we don’t have a choice. Because fear keeps us gambling much like addiciton keeps gamblers gambling. And the sad part is we know our odds. It’s unquestionable. Because we’ve been playing the game for a very long time. 

So yes, yes I do want to quit the fucking game. Yes I do want to die. So stop telling me to live. Just stop. 

Don’t tell me to die but don’t tell me to live. 

And if you do think after reading all that, if you still think I should stay alive. 

Then go fuck yourself. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, the suicidal, the manic, the depressed, the anxious, and the broken.

47,"16 year old boy trying to figure out what’s wrong with me.To everyone around me I set an image of a fun, funny, nice person. But all of that is fake. In reality I want nothing to do with anyone and I want to be left alone. When I’m at home I lay down in the dark because it’s very relaxing and I feel isolated from everybody. On my sports teams I have an impression that I love interacting with everybody but I honestly hate it unless it’s someone that I have known for years. I’m very bad in social situations and I don’t ever try to make new friends. I worry that I will come off weird because of the fact that  I don’t know how to start or maintain a conversation without sounding and being awkward. I pretend to be happy in front of everyone like the people around me and family. I find joy in being alone where no one can judge me. Even at practice I avoid going into drills (which often gets me yelled at) because I’m not the best and not trying to embarrass myself. You’d think that because I play sports I’d have some friends but they’re all a blur to me once the seasons end. Am I a misanthrope or something or....",24Feb2018,3
48,"If you haven't read it, Glover basically posits that ""Nice Guys"" (different from a genuinely kind and agreeable man) are in fact men with toxic shame, and who, due to early experiences, get it into their heads that ""If I can hide my flaws and be what others want me to be, only then will I be loved and have my needs met."" I won't go into deep details here, but I've basically felt from my earliest years that if I put one toe out of line, I'll be abandoned - fire and brimstone. The result? I had to hide who and what I was from the beginning.

My parents are extremely academic, and really are pretty pessimistic about life. I know it's because they've experienced a lot of disappointments in their lives, and they just want to spare me the same fate, but basically they won't hear of me doing anything except something that's lucrative (the NiceGuyness means I'm not really cut out for the cutthroat world of business, so basically it's either the lottery or a STEM field). And, Nice Guy that I am, I feel like the absolute nadir of sons for not being able to bear it anymore.

To sum up? All of this, combined with wanking since I was 13, has made me a stranger to myself. Thus, nothing ever seemed worth working on.

I could have been a musician, I could have been a magician, I could have been an actor, I could have been an artist, I could have been a dancer, I could have been a chef, I could have been a woodworker, I could have been anything I wanted to be.

Now...well, childhood is when you're supposed to build the skills to do those things, because as an adult, not only is your time spoken for because of your job and obligations, but your own brain starts turning on you. Adults don't have 10,000 hours to learn when they have work, doing what they have to do to get by even if they're completely miserable.

All my life, I've been on a path I've never wanted to be on. My natural strengths are in maths and science but I absolutely hate them. It's lucrative, but the material is dry as the fucking Sahara. And yet, I've done it, because to do otherwise would be, to that stunted part of my mind, extremely dangerous. And yet, if I don't step off it, I'll either completely go round the bend or hang myself.

Yes, I'm aware I'm having a midlife crisis about twenty-five years early (I'll be 23 in April). And yet, I feel the rope tightening on my neck.",24Feb2018,6

55,"I’ve been married for almost 20 years to the love of my life. We have two beautiful daughters, fulfilling jobs, we love our lives. My wife, however, is most likely an alcoholic. Both of her parents are alcoholics. It doesn’t effect her job, she’s quite functional. 

That is not why I’m writing today, however. I am writing today because of what happens when she gets really drunk. She turns into another person. A mean, nasty, irrational, manipulative horrible person, but also clearly emotionally wounded. This has been happening for nearly 20 years. I had decided over the last year that the best thing I could do is not engage with her when this happens. This is better, but it’s very difficult and it makes me feel like an asshole. 

The next morning she has no memory of her behavior, which is super frustrating. Last night, this other person took over and I tried to disengage but she manipulated me into a discussion that led to some really hurtful and embarrassed feelings on my end. The exact same thing happened the last time, which she didn't remember the next day. I asked the other version of her last night if she remembered the last time and she did, which kind of freaked me out. I asked her this morning if she had any memory of any of this and she said no. In other words, sober wife can’t access any of these memories, but the other personality can access these memories that we thought were “blackouts”. This really disturbs me. 

What am I dealing with here?  Besides alcoholism. Our lives outside of these isolated incidents are wonderful and we’re loving, supportive partners and parents. She hates the idea of therapy and I think I’d have to threaten to leave to get her to participate, but I know that’s what we need. I think she’d be up for giving up alcohol if I asked her to. But is that going to solve the underlying issue that’s causing this other personality to manifest?  Won’t it find a way to come out another way?

I’m at my wits end. Please help. Thank you.",24Feb2018,3
