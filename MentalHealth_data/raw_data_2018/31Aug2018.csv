0,"i'm going insane and i know for sure at this point i have some sort of mental illness. idk what it is, but all i know is that i don't function the same or like other people. i get upset over little shit like a child but it's the rage and extreme emotion that drives it. mood swings basically. there's no in between with me. i'm ok one second and one thing will set me off into flipping the fuck out and damn there having a mental breakdown. i did this today and brother was like i don't know how insane i look and he's right. i look fucking crazy flipping out over shit so quickly. if someone doesn't do something with me, i feel neglected and feel like no one cares about me and that shit will make me upset all day sometimes. i'm becoming too much to handle with me friends. and i don't know if they r actually rejecting and avoiding and abandoning me or is it all in my head. i'm scared for myself. i recently got out of a mental hospital after attempting suicide. i think i might end up going back. bc i self harm and feel suicidal a lot more than i use to. i've had problems with self harm in the past but its a lot more frequent. anyone have any recommendations about what i should do, what i mental disorder i have?",31Aug2018,5

I believe that mental illness is just a reflection of what's going on in your life. I don't believe in chemical imbalances, or that something is wrong with the brain",31Aug2018,0
3,"Hi!

While I have never been officially diagnosed, I can say with some confidence that I share many of the criteria for MD and can say I have been like this since I was a young child. Part of it seems to involve me having obsessions, usually things to add into my made up worlds. Trying to explain it like OCD, but for ideas and concepts and images rather than behaviors or routines, if that makes any sense. I will often find myself fixating on these obsessions for hours, sometimes to the point of inducing a headache, even thinking over and over about the same things. 

Has anyone had something similar, any ideas what it could be?",31Aug2018,2

It started off simple like forgetting to bring a towel to the shower or forgetting what I was suppose to read for my college homework, but it has come to the point where I am completely forgetting my college schedule and I have already lost my lanyard which has all my essential keys, ranging from my house to my dorm room keys. I feel like I can't recall the simplest things and no matter how hard I try to remember something, its always gone five minutes later. This is becoming an escalating issue for me and I feel awful about it. If anyone could give a suggestion or two to give me a idea on what to do about it, it would be nice.

She screamed at me ""grow the fuck up"" after I asked why it was bad, stated that in my opinion there was nothing wrong, then stated that I was just going to delete Facebook then. I ultimately decided not to and left the cover picture blank and made the profile picture black. After I did that I became overwhelmed with a panic attack and what I could only describe as my body shutting down and turning on repeatedly for 5 minutes. I could barely breathe, walk, talk, and text my sister Tasha to get help from her as she is in nursing school. It's been a couple hours and I'm still shaky, even typing this. My Dad and Lisa are in their 50s and highly dislike hip-hop how most of them look. I also suspect they are racist as they always have to bring up race when identifying someone and my Dad has used the word nigger many times in the past. Right now I strongly feel I should move out and live with my sister Tasha or my Aunt Debbie and Uncle Joe as in the past they offered to take me in if anything were to happen to my Dad as they don't like Lisa either.

6,"Hello I hope you take time to read my experience
For as long as I can remember I have been constantly daydreaming. I develop MD because I was always alone = I felt lonely when in the first decade of my life  and Derealization soon fallowed. I believe I develop this because I didn’t make any real connection with REAL people.

7,"Very recently my girlfriend and I went on a break of sorts. She moved back home and so did I (2 states apart). She's been battling anxiety and depression for years now (we're both 23 been dating for 4 years). Iv been with her supporting her every step of the way. At first I didn't understand it. I had never known anyone who had it before. I tried and tried to learn more about it. Still do. Iv been with her when she'd cut herself (on her hips) because she thought I didn't love her (she doesn't cut anymore). Iv been with her when we were in my car crying late at night and she jumped out (it was in a parking lot thankfully). Iv held her countless nights where she's cried in my arms about student loan debt, and stressing about how she will take care of herself without family aid. She has stopped taking medication and seeing a therapist for I don't know how long.  She didn't like the one she had so she stopped going and didn't get a new one. I don't know how long she didn't take medication either. I took her to a walk- in recently and they said she was very stressed and prescribed her something but she only took a few. Not the full 30 days worth.  We both graduated college this past year and she hasn't been able to find a job in her field. I recently got one and thought maybe that was adding to her stress. That if we stayed living together, she'd be freeloading.  Not true at all, my entire family loves her on both sides and would do anything to help her, mentally, financially, help her find a good job. Whenever she wanted to be left alone I listened to her. Because I love her. I think a combination of her not getting the help she needs, me going on interviews and getting a job, her not getting many interviews, being stuck in retail, missing her family and feeling alone made her panic and go back home and as of right now, essentially ghost me. I have been with her every step of the way and I want to continue to be. We haven't talked in almost a week and it kills me. I want to give her her space that she wants but I also want her to get the help and support that she needs. I'm too scared to say this to her because I don't want to push her away. I have always been there for her. Iv left friends and other things on a dime to be with her if she needed me too. Whether I could hear it in her tone of voice or not.  I'd gladly still do the same. But I can only meet her halfway and that she has to take accountability by getting her mental health on track and maybe, hopefully start talking to me again so we can focus on us and our future again. But if that day never comes I hope that she gets her mental health on track so she can have confidence in herself again and be the badass woman I fell in love with again. I love her so much. I just want her as a human being to be okay even if she no longer wants to be with me. ",31Aug2018,15

And I’ve made improvements in my life to get better. 

I came out at my university. It’s the best thing. 
It’s been a little scary at some points, but I did it and now I’m know as who I actually am!

I chose to study biology. I love animals. I don’t know what my future looks like with a biology degree, but I would love to do research at the university.

I made an appointment with my therapist, went and turns out, I actually have Aspergers/ mild autism.  I sort of suspected it, but never had anyone confirm of deny. She’s going to try to help me get on better medication. 

I wanted to Self harm so badly these past two days, but I haven’t! 

I know this sounds like “whoopdie doo, who gives a shit.” But I care. I’ve been depressed since I can remember and I used to write suicide notes like clock work.

I think I’m heading the right way (*knock on wood*) . We’ll see how this goes!

It’s really dark out but my thought process right now is “I don’t think I care if something bad was to happen to me while on my way to the store”  but yet here I am ... still here at my house, in my backyard, in the dark. It’s like as if my mind is the little devil telling me “go walk by yourself in the dark, let’s see what happens” but my body is like “wait what? No don’t be stupid” 

Honestly,  I also don’t know why I’m writing this. I guess just looking for someone to talk to.  I usually become my own worst enemy when I’m lonely. ",31Aug2018,5
10,"I have wanted to write this for a month now. I have ADHD and OCD and all my frustrations i cope with compulsive eating. To the point that in my 5 years in university i have gone from 215 to 345. It all started with me eating double portions. I would sometimes buy a full plate of rice and meat 30 mins after i just had a full meal. Its gotten to the point where i have very little clothes that fit me well and its a drag to go to the mall to shop because i just hate the way i look.  I get stressed and i just start to eat. Just while writing this paragraph i have gotten 3 slices of ham with mustard. But this past summer my has just gotten more stressful.

Since September, i had wanted to get back with my long distance girlfriend. Maybe the feeling of being alone and just having experienced one of the most destructive hurricanes where i live may have triggered that reaction. I planned to go an visit her for the first time this summer and see if we could get back together. I got a loan ( I know, stupid) so that i could travel. The whole process of obtaining a visa was stressful af. I sent the application on a Friday and got it 2 Mondays after I payed for 2 day processing because that week the consulate had national holiday and then it was the 4th of July and i forgot to send the return envelope. Even getting the application was a hassle because i needed a letter of invitation to get into the country but to get the letter i needed to book the hostel who wouldn't give unless i had the letter which i need to book .....

Even though we were broken up, my ex and I texted every day but we had a rocky friendship. I have to admit i was an asshole for much of it and my reassurance seeking that she would give me a chance really made things worse, why she continued to text me i still wonder.  After 3 planes and one train ride i finally meet up with her and it was everything i had feared it was. She was kind of dry with me. If i would ask about a statue or land mark her answer would have been ""I don't know"".  On that day i think i only made her laugh once. 

She had to go to work so she took me to hostel, which is in the same building complex as hers. When the hostel doesn't open up, i go to work with her but stay in the car while she handles her business. There i contemplate if everything that i had done up to there was worthless. She then comes back and we go back to the hostel to see why didn't they open up. While on the ride she mentions that she would go stay at a lake house for her friend's birthday.  I was like ok cool she would probably go on Saturday and return Monday. I had to buy a towel and asked her if maybe she wanted popcorn and  we could watch a movie. She told me she wasn't in the mood and she just wanted to go to sleep. I was like ok maybe tomorrow. 

We get to the hostel and they tell us via the phone that my reservation wasn't confirmed. I had to get another hostel. I asked her if i could go up to her apartment to let my parents know that i had gotten there. She agrees. While there she says that i need to find a hostel that day because i couldn't stay there and she was leaving the next day, Wednesday, to the lake house and wouldn't be back till at least Tuesday. I was like wtf but ok, asked her if we could go to a landmark when she came back and she said she didn't know but she didn't really like the place. She takes me to hostel and she tells me to text her when i book in. I said ok and went to give her a hug goodbye. She thought i was going to kiss her and she ducked and walked away. (Like seriously, why would i kiss her there, like all the signals so far would say i should, ""Oh yeah, ignore me, its such a turn on"")

I book in and just start to cry in my bed. I texted her that i wasn't trying to kiss her, and we just started to argue. She said she just wished everyone stopped trying to date her. I decided the next day that i would just leave and go to Paris. When i told her I was leaving and started to laugh and asked me why was i leaving. I told her I came for what i wanted, to see her and visit the Landmark,( which i did in the morning), and i had nothing to do there. She told me to not be petty and ""see the country"". I told her that I wasn't being petty, that if i came to see her and she didnt want anything to do with me then why would i be here . She tell me she never made plans with me. I told her she was being dense and how could she not see that all i wanted to be with her there. She said she wasn't being dense and that she was having fun. Thats when i realized i was  dealing with a 14 yrld. I stopped texting her. I went to Paris and had an awesome time and met some awesome people.

As i got back home i got some shattering news. My (step)dad died the 4 days before i got back. Hearing my mom tell me that if it wasn't for me, she wouldn't be able to handle it. The man I had known for at least 20 of my 22 years and was my father died in a car crash. I had to keep my head busy because my OCD would image his body all bloodied from the accident, gasping for air. Even as i type this words I try to suppress my rumination. We had to wait 2 weeks for the body to be released to be able to hold a wake for him before he was being transported to his home country to be buried. I broke down when i saw the casket opened. When it was time to give him the last goodbye i couldnt bare it and i just went home and cried myself to sleep. 

I had uploaded a picture of him in my IG and my ex saw it and texted me condolences and said that if there was anything she could do for me let her know. I just said lets be friends and she agreed. I told myself that i would get over her and just move on. Then she uploaded a new selfie and i was drooling like an idiot. Idk why i keep thinking about her in a romantic way when i know she dont want anything and she hates all the things i like and the only thing we have in common is the love for her Pug that is the cutest thing to have ever existed. And roasting people. Maybe its Love, Lust, Loneliness or me being a Loser. But i wont chase her again. We still text but all as friends.

The thing im most afraid of is letting my mom down, not being there now that she need me the most. Im a fuck up right now. Cant lose weight, always have an excuse, my relationship with my ex is Chernobyl levels of wrong, I could be making more money from my job but my procrastination is severe, last year of uni and i dont know if i will pass all classes. And I never got to play with the Pug.

12,"This is the first Time in my life I have experienced stress on this level, It has to do with my school classes which I have severely fucked up and have been stressed out for the course of this entire week, but today was definitely the worst of it. I had no mental capacity all day, unable to focus on my classes, my head flooded with this fear and worry of one mistake, thinking it could derail the rest of my high school career and that it could possibly effect me when I go to college.

I don't know how to help myself deal with this severe stress, I would usually play video games when I was stressed before but this time I couldn't even do that, my head just kept going back to how I might have to take an extra history class next year, or how I'm going to earn the credit or how I'm going to catch up on 3 weeks of a course that I haven't been in. anyways sorry for rambling, but if you have any suggestions on how to ease my stress/anxiety, please let me know.",31Aug2018,2
13,"Where to begin. This might be a little long so hopefully any who read won’t mind it’s hard for me to talk about myself like this. For years I’ve not been feeling very stable. I tend to have extremely manic periods where I do impulsive things like buy things, spend money, things I can’t afford, and risky behaviors. I’ve done things I’m not proud of. I tend to have very very high highs. I’m a naturally bubbly outgoing person but I have had some anxiety issues from time to time although less so now. I am openly gay and was bullied in school and still have some issues from that. I have a touch of body dysmorphia too. Lately I’ve been having pretty severe mood swings all over the place I can go from feeling somewhat normal to deeply depressed within the span of minutes if I feel someone has slighted me or insulted me even if it’s totally misconstrued I can get in my head and sink to the depths of despair to the point of having suicidal thoughts over the smallest thing. In short I tend to be hyper aware and sensitive to other people’s interactions with me. I’ll obsess over something or a comment someone made and analyze it to death and can make me deeply depressed or majorly excited and euphoric. My usual mood is fairly upbeat and bubbly but I am realizing that actually I am a bit manic and spastic sometimes. Sometimes I think I’m just extreme all or nothing ways and get really really angry over something or someone. I’m all over the place. 

It’s getting worse as I get older. My mood swings are becoming bad and it’s exhausting me. My anger is getting worse too. I can be up and fairly manic for days but I rarely get depressed for more than a few hours at a time. Also I’m having trouble trusting people and getting close to people too. I’m having intimacy issues. I’ll be putting myself down but then someone can pay me a compliment and as quick as that I can be bubbly and cheerful and bouncing off the walls and just want to go shopping or just do anything. 

Here’s the weird part, for awhile now, I feel like my mind is trying to split. Sometimes I get these overwhelming emotions at certain times and it feels like there is a different person in my mind, like I feel like I lose myself sometimes if that makes sense. Like someone else is almost going to take over. My whole life at least the last several years I’ve felt like I’m running from something but done know what. I just feel sometimes like I can’t sit down and be quiet or some monster or something horrible will happen to me so I just try to always be up busy doing something or keeping myself occupied so I won’t have time to think about what I’m scared of. Probably makes no sense  but that’s how I feel. I don’t hear voices or hallucinate or anything like that. I just don’t know what’s going on with my mind. I see a psychiatric nurse but he seems to think it’s just anxiety but the meds he’s given me haven’t done shit except make me feel physically ill. I have a friend who has a doctorate in psychology and he says he thinks I am bipolar and need a mood stabilizer and to find me an actual psychiatrist to help me. What is wrong with me? Does this sound like bipolar? Why the mood swings and why do I get so manic all the time? Sorry for the long post I just needed to post and hope someone else can maybe relate or give me some advice. Thanks!",31Aug2018,1
14,"Having issues with good libido or desire for sex. 30 year old male. Married and have sex about 3-5 times a week. But the desire is not there I don't feel super horny I just go through the motions and finish off with the wife. Have only been married for a few months. I used to get hard and raved like an animal in my teens and early 20s but the last 5-8 years I've noticed the interest in sex has declined a lot. I lift heavy at the gym 3 days a week. Keep fit. No alcohol no cigarettes no recreational drugs.

I have taken a lot of things like maca, tribulus, long jack etc. Nothing has worked. Vit D with magnesium. And zinc are part of my daily supps along with creatine monohydrate.

Did a blood test with the doctor a few weeks ago which showed my testosterone to be slightly lower than normal but it wasn't a fasted blood test so about to do another blood test tomorrow while fasted and I'm sure that will bring the levels back into the 'normal range'.

Is there anything I am missing? Or is it normal to be uninterested in sex at 30? I just don't desire women sexually anymore. You could put the hottest 20 year old in front of me and I wouldn't bat an eyelid. This just doesn't feel right to me.

16,"Sorry, this is kind of long guys :(

I'm 28 and I've worked in retail for the last 11 years of my life. My last job was incredibly stressful because I was management, it was a small pharmacy (part of a large chain) and there were never enough hours to do everything. Typical retail. You were the only loss prevention, and it was in an area with a lot of homeless and drug addicts. Most of the time it was only one manager and one cashier scheduled so, being the manager, I was the security. Just putting it out there that I'm 5'3"" and like 110lbs. I'm not cut out for that. Anyway, I ended up deciding to quit my job after someone popped a squat in the hallway outside of the manager's office. When it happened, I text-raged to my boyfriend (I've been with him for 3 years) and he ignored me for over a day and told me that I'm always miserable because of work (he dropped the 'I love you, but I don't know if I'm IN love with you'), but he wanted to stick it out because he knew I wanted to quit. I was really hurt, especially since someone relieving themself in the hall is something worthy of a complaint. I put in my two weeks immediately the next day.

My friend and roommate, let's call her A, works as a cocktail server part-time and was making way more than me at my management job. So I made a plan. I had a month tops to get a serving job. I'd save up. Go to trade school and do something I like. Never hate my job again. Finally feel good about what I'm doing with myself. Well, surprises happened.

A's sister, let's call her B, also rooms with us along with her boyfriend, let's call him Z. Well, Z has two dogs that  seem to be pretty territorial. I have a small, old man dog that just likes to eat, sleep, and chill. I love him to death. Long story short, within the first week of me quitting, Z's dog attacked my dog. It was the second time within a month that it happened. First time wasn't too bad. This time was pretty gnarly. My dog couldn't walk right. His sides were covered in bruises. His neck was completely raw (Z's dog tried to shake him like a rag doll).  Z and B agreed to pay the vet bills both times, not happily though. The vet told us to bring him back in after 10 days if he still couldn't put pressure on his one leg. 

Back to the job hunt, I'm pumping out applications for serving jobs everywhere I can. First week, no calls. Second week, no calls. Turns out, every serving position requires a year of previous serving experience. I thought my good record and management/customer service experience was enough to make up for it. It's not.

A ended up getting me a job at her work. But so far she said they only want to give me two nights a week. No matter the tips, I won't be able to afford to live on that. I'm almost entirely out of money. I'm going to need a second job. 

It's been 3 weeks since my dog got attacked and I needed to take him back to the vet because he still won't walk on his leg and I've noticed a popping feeling in his shoulder when I pick him up. I talked to B about it and she didn't seem interested at all in her or Z helping me pay for an X-ray and whatever needs to be done after that. So I asked A if she could help me cover the cost and I'll pay her back. She reluctantly said she would, but I already owe her money (as she embarassingly made sure to mention at the vet office today in front of the receptionist). 

Because of stress, I was a little rude to my boyfriend last night. I was texting him about how I was going to need a second job and he didn't say anything about it until 2am, followed by him saying good night. He checks his phone pretty often, so it kind of hurts when I'm really upset and it takes him 4 hours to reply with a sentence and then he dips right after that so I can't have a conversation. He texted me this morning and said 4 hours wasn't the end of the world (ignored everything else I was saying about why I was stressed). So I decided I'd give him some space since I probably made him mad.

I'm stressed out enough that all day I've just started crying out of nowhere. I've been stress scrolling social media nonstop. I can't pay attention to anything. I start dissociating after I cry for a while. I'm just in a really bad spot. I gave in and texted my boyfriend because he never said anything else all day. He hasn't bothered to answer, so I'm probably in for it. He's told me before that he doesn't like me asking him for emotional support because I need to learn to be my own support.
I consider A my best friend, but we haven't been as close as we used to be. A lot of times, there's a really catty atmosphere and she can be condescending. Almost everyone else in my life is an acquaintance or someone I don't feel comfortable talking to. Don't get me started on my family.

I guess what I'm asking for from random people on the internet is some kind of validation, and any good coping advice. I can't seem to ask anyone else. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't have the emotions that I do. Sometimes I feel like it's wrong of me to ask people for help, support, or advice because they have their own stuff going on. Sometimes I wish someone would just hug me and tell me that it's okay. Sometimes I feel like I'm worthless because I'm already 28 and I've done nothing with my life. Then when I get into this morbid state of mind, I don't know how to stop it.",31Aug2018,1
17,"Bit of context: Before my SO and I got together, I experienced a traumatic event which I disclosed to him in order to keep the communication open and be honest about my past.

I think I understand the concept, I've done a bit of research, but can't relate or get on his level as I've never experienced them myself.
I hate seeing him go through this, but don't know how I can help.

Every now and then there is a video on reddit that strikes close to home, this video was it for me. (In relation to this post -[Reddit Video Of Kids On Xanax](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/99h1iz/these_kids_are_high_on_xanax_if_you_play_the/)

​

Xanax and I had an affair over a decade ago now, and i'm still paying for our passionate exchange. Period.

​

This drug is one of the absolute most horrible substances on earth and it took more from me than all other compounds combined. I was prescribed xanax after a brutal accident I was involved in, leaving me with a broken back, a broken neck and a heap of PTSD. I've always suffered from anxiety, starting at a very young age. After the accident the anxiety came ten fold and I had to figure out a way to address it. In comes the 2mg xanax or as we called them ""bars"" or ""handles"" (per their resemblance of a candy bar, with its 4 segments you can break off). The doctor tells you to take .25 of a 2 mg xanax when your anxiety flairs up, well thats all fine at first, the issue is when your body starts to build a tolerance to the drug and you start to notice that the .25mg isn't stopping the anxiety anymore. Now you start taking .5 mg of a 2 mg xanax and you notice the feeling of uncontrollable and unexplanible fear and anxiety is washed away again. Ahhhhh, finally... Relief.

​

This is great, I feel so SMOOTH when i'm talking to women. NOTHING worries me. Hell, I just wrecked my truck but i wasn't worried at all. I'm fine, insurance will cover it and fuck this guy whose yelling at me, he needs to take a fuckin chill pill, it's not like his insurance isn't going to cover the damage to his car as well. Did I take my xanax today? Better take it now just in case. What day is it? Fuck it. I'm hungry, better take my xanax before I go eat, I think the other is wearing off. What day is it? Did I take my xanax today? Fuck it, better take one just in case.

​

A week or two goes by and you start to notice that the half of a xanax isn't doing it anymore and you need to take a full 2mg to take the edge off. You also start to notice that your bottle of xanax that you carry around with you EVERYWHERE is beginning to empty far before your next refill. Your anxiety continually grows and you now need one and a half bars to get you through the day. Your relationship tanks or a friend dies and your two xanax bars a day seem to do the trick. Your bottle is empty tho. Time to fill one prescription at multiple pharmacies all across town. You've tricked the pharmacies into filling your prescriptions. You have two bottles now, you can take you four xanax that you need to get through your day. Did you take 4 today? I still feel anxiety, I should take another. Did I take it? I'll take another. I think I took 5 bars today but I'll take another just in case. Why is my bottle empty already? Did I just refill it? I took 7 bars today.. I think.. Lets see.. I took 2 when I woke up, 2 more at lunch, 2 in the evening, another 2 before I went out to party with my friends. What day is it? Did I see you last night? Why is my second bottle empty already? Why am I in the hospital? Who got hurt? Where is my car? Why am I in jail? Did I take my xanax today? My friends want to have an intervention with me, but I dont give a fuck about them. My family is crying and begging me, fuck them. They don't understand what it's like for me without my bars.I'LL FUCKING DIE IF I DON'T TAKE THEM! THEY ALL DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ME! IM OK WITH MY XANAX, FUCK THEM IF THEY WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME!!!! FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE I FEEL OK!!!!! WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYONE SO FUCKING WORRIED ABOUT ME!?!?! IM FINE!!!!!!!

​

I remember if I didn't hear the sound of the pills rattling in my pocket, I would almost have a heart attack. God forbid I lost the bottle I would fucking lose my mind and turn my house upside down only to realize they were in the backpack I was wearing all along.

​

You become dependent on those pills and you no longer own them, they own you. They own you to the very core of your exsistance.

​

Oh you thought the worst was over? Wait until the withdrawal.

Cold sweats, out of body experiences, crawling skin. You wish you would die. You feel as if youre dead.

The kicker to it all is the fact you now are facing the worst anxiety you've ever had, so bad it makes you wish you could just have the anxiety you first had, before you started taking the drug.

You can literally DIE from benzodiazepine withdrawals if you quit cold turkey as I did.

​

It happens fast, it snowballs without warning. You will lose segments of your life.

I do not mean seconds, or minutes, or hours. I mean days, weeks, months and years.

You will lose friends and family.

Your memory will not regain itself, and if used in conjunction with alcohol will sustain even greater permanent damage.

You will forget your own life, your childhood, the people you've met, the good and bad experiences you've had.

You will walk a blank slated road, unsure of what you've experienced and what you haven't. Whom you've experienced it with and whom you haven't.

​

​

I was at 11+ Xanax bars a day at one point around the age of 23. I lost large portions of my life and have forgotten most of my childhood. I do not remember any of my teenage years other than a few fleeting moments that somehow managed to hang on. My memory both short and long term now is absolutely horrible. When I was a child, my father would always remind me of how well I could retain long strings of numbers and repeat them back to him days later without hesitation. Now I struggle to remember what ive done 3 days ago, or what ive said to someone within the last 24 hours.

​

I tell stories to the same people several times as if i've never spoken to them before about said subjects. I ask questions that i've already exhausted several times unknowingly. I forget names as soon as they are said to me and I have forgotten my past.

​

Xanax is absolutely not a joke. It might help some people with their anxiety, but it is only a band-aid to an ever growing wound. The band-aid will tear, and rip as you re-apply bigger bandages but the wound will only continue to seep and fester, until you either die and forget you've died, or you end up like me and forget who you were to begin with.

​

Xanax abuse can lead to early onset of dementia as well as a load of other complications. If you drink (as I did) on them you run the risk of damage to your heart and death.

​

Please kids out there, do not fall into the grasp of Xanax. Many entertainers/rappers sensationalize the drug and these guys in this video are prime examples of the demographic who are affected. You will not know you are under its spell until its far too late.

Today at practice my coach told me something, and i heard it but it didn’t connect. I stared at my hands, and after a few seconds i realized “holy shit i’m doing it” there was like a lag, while i was mentally looking at my hands my body acted and I panicked. 

After that everything was blurry like when you stand up too fast. I couldn’t breathe and my heart was beating too fast.

22,"Throw away account.

I need some help. Some info about myself. I am 29m. Currently taking medication for depression and anxiety. Have seen several therapists for years. At 3 days a week with my current therapist.  I have made real progress the past few years. 

Two weeks ago was my biggest milestone yet. I graduated from college. I have a bachelors degree of computer science. Most people would feel happy. I am miserable. Just a horrible time. 

I can't look at my resume for more than 20minutes without having to stop. Months I have been working on my resume. Weeks would go by without me thinking about it. The anxiety I feel around it is too much. 

I think back to a few years and I realized all the baby steps it took to get here.  Some really hard steps that I was able to make it through. Resume is my next step and it is so difficult. My anxiety is out of control. My therapist say I am self sabotaging myself. Which I feel might be possible. He has also been helping me work on the resume during our appointments. 

To give my whole life story would take too long. Just some basics I think may help.  Youngest of a very large family. Mom and dad have undiagnosed mental health issues. I see a lot of anxiety and depression in my father and mother.  My parents had me when they were old. Mom was in her 40s and dad 50s.
I have a lot of hurts growing up in this family. 

I have been dealing with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

It's like I am always searching. For answers or something. If I dig deep enough I will find a answer. A moment where everything will shift and the world will become clear.  

I constantly second guess my own feelings and thoughts. I vent all this stuff and memories to my therapist. Nothing ever processed because the answer isn't clear. I need to be told what emotion to feel or maybe it's to finally have my feelings validated. 

Is that all I really need? Validate my own emotions. Stop trying or being upset that I want validation from people who are completely incapable of doing it. I have to find it myself? I don't know the answer. I just have tons of questions. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. To say anxiety and depression just doesn't work. Something is wrong. I am constantly searching for a answer. What do you think is wrong with me? Some how that answer is important to me. Could it be borderline personality disorder? ",31Aug2018,6
23,"I don't know where to turn to.
I've been awake for so long, any sleep I get is restless and usually has fever nightmares.
I'm 18, I have never experienced Chronic insomnia before. I have been extremely stressed, depressed, and have felt relatively isolated the past few months. My job sucks, I don't like the people around me, I'm self absorbed, etc.

Before the insomnia, last Saturday, I decided to just not get any sleep. I had to work from 12-2 on Sunday, but I didn't really get any sleep (by choice) before then. Monday, I worked 8 hours. Again, not a lot of sleep by choice. 

Tuesday night, finished an hour shift. Fall asleep for 3 hours. After that, it gets fuzzy but here we go.

I actually don't really remember what happened. Everything is a blur. Wednesday as well, mostly.

Symptoms are not just mental. Sure, anxiety could cause them but I don't know. Whenever I wouls begin to relax, I would get this hotness in my body everywhere, but especially in my neck and head. Nausea. I could feel things move through intestinal track. I would wake up from restless sleep, thinking I was dying. I suffer from general anxiety disorder, but I'm certain it can't just be that. 

I've been a total hypochondriac lately and searching for any amount of understanding of what's going on with me.

I got so freaked out that I called an ambulance early Thursday morning. The hospital ended up (with what little info I was able to give them) giving me hydrOXYzine, which made me calm down and I had a bit of a nap on the bed. Still woke up a lot, though. I always think I'm not breathing right, and I figure that maybe a leaky gut is causing my diaphragm to be weakened. Idk. My brain feels like it's frying right now. I self diagnosed myself with ALS and convinced myself I was going to die. Wtf. What is wrong with me. I can't see a way out of this situation. I can't get any sleep no matter how calm I become.

hes been struggling finding a job for the past few months and has been a bit depressed lately. a few days ago he went to his car to get some alone time and watch youtube videos, which he regularly does so we didnt think anything of it. but as it turns out this time he went and cut up his wrists pretty badly. my sister took him to the hospital to seek help for the cuts and then he was placed under suicide watch overnight at the hospital.

26,"Official diagnose: BPD
My bf is struggling with anxiety as well and he even started smoking again and lied to me about it so I found out and asked him to stay away and decided whether he wants to go on with relationship or continue smoking. He went to seek professional help. And I don't think I'm being unfair because he has always known about my restrictions regarding smoking. Anyway, I can't self harm when I want so I suppose it should go for everybody else.

I'm gonna spend a week alone at home and he is feeling bad so he can't babysit me cause he wants to avoid fights or any tensions. I have no structure to stay alone at home but I can't tell the truth to mom because she needs to go on this work trip. 

I'm struggling so bad with my self image and depression and anxiety. Med school is eating me alive. I feel like I can't accomplish anything, get anything done. I feel so exhausted all time. 

And so incredibly alone.

When I tried to kill myself the first time this year my best friend pushed me away and said he can't be this person. He can't be there for me. He can't put himself at the risk of suffering over me or having to take care of me. And I think he expected me to fight him or something since I did that a lot.  But like I gave up myself, I can't stand myself most of days. Why would I ask him to do the same? Lol. Still, when he's struggling he comes to me. I guess I'm still his friend no matter what.

But what I mean is... I don't feel like I can be honest to anyone or no one is in good condition or willing to help me anyway. I wasn't able to afford therapy, only meds so I'm going back to therapy on thursday but it takes a while to adjust idk

27,"Hello all,

I've been a lurker here for awhile and wanted to shine some hope in the darkness. Today I finally went to see a psychologist and am on the path to recovery. At age 19 I was sexually abused and had a near death experience. Years after I felt safe enough to reach out and get help, the PTSD caught up with me and the flight mode has ended and I'm ready to fight.  
I'm not going to give some cheesy speech on how the future is worth it, or just to hang in there. But what I can say is : get rid of those who do not support you. Get rid of those who do not believe you. Distract yourself enough to be able to find calm and one day you'll accept and finally get help. The build up of stress leading up to that point where you have to call for an appointment might be overwhelming; rip it off like a band-aid and plow though because once you finally do it will feel relieving and you will be your own hero.

If you are taking the time to read this, thank you so much.

I am currently working on an initiative with the Do No Harm Foundation to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health, and I need your help. There are so many people who know they need help but don't know where to go or who they can talk to out of fear of judgement. I have personally struggled with this, and I know so many people who also feel this way when they shouldn't have to. There are also people who wrestle within themselves - fighting the thoughts of ""Do I have depression?"", ""Am I bipolar?"", or ""Am I normal?"". That last question hurts me the most; why are we automatically labeling what is normal? Why are terms such as ""crazy"" and ""maniac"" thrown around so much in today's society as a way to describe someone who is struggling with their mental health? This stigma is so poisonous to our well-being, and I mean ALL of us - those who have a mental health problem and those who don't.

This program will provide people with a platform to speak about mental health and to gain support from others. I wanted to make this survey in order to better understand what I need to address in this initiative. Your responses are completely anonymous - I will not be able to trace any answers to you. This program is so close to my heart, and I hope you can contribute and remember that ""kindness is the language that the deaf can hear and the blind can see"".

And whenever I do manage to bring up the issue, the psychologist says things like ""He (me) believes that you are being rude"", my Dad answers and that issue is over. I cannot explain it with my terrible English, but it is very one-sided with the psychologist supporting my Dad mostly.

\- Smirking on certain things and not considering it important.

I will be starting with a TL;DR and some basic info.

Girlfriend suffers from chronic depression and anxiety, has for life. I have currently told her I wanted out, because my own mental health started to suffer. She asked me to reconsider.

I told her I would need space, and left for a safe haven. I have been gone just shy of a week.

She feels like she had no chance to change, feels like I have been very bad at communicating my needs and problems. I agree I have been overprotective, not wanting to hurt her, but the few times I’ve brought my problems up, she either went sad and closed off, or got grumpy with little to no change.

Currently she is texting me daily, asking me when I’ve made my choice, mentioned suicide more than once, has apologised and lashed out. She can’t understand why I need to take such a long time to consider.

I'm now stuck.

Help med Reddit, how do I decide between giving her a chance to prove her will to change, and me getting my sanity back?

Quick fact list:

* Been a couple \~4 years.
* Known each other \~11 years.
* We have no children.
* We are not married.
* We are both of ordinary weight, bit of extra weight that comes with a sedentary life, not chubby. She's attractive, to me and others, but she sees herself as fat, probably because she used to be very skinny before we started dating, and of course lack of self-confidence.
* She suffers from depression and anxiety, and has for her whole life so far.
* I'm emotionally stable, no history of mental issues.
* She's unemployed and aside from the odd summer job in her youth, has never held a ""real"" job due to mental health.
* She has had a troubled childhood.
* She has been getting professional help since before we were an item, and is currently seeing both a psychologist and psychiatrist.
* She has been on a slew of medication, almost all of it killing her libido.
* She is currently on medicine proscribed by the psychiatrist.
* She has no day rhythm, can sleep all day stay up all night, it fluctuates back and forth.
* She often needs medication or watch a video (with earphones) to help her sleep, says her mind won't leave her alone.
* She has no purpose in life, nothing to wake up to. No reason to keep a rhythm.
* She has no real life friends aside from me, has a handful of online friends. None of those friendships appear very deep.
* Her family is unattainably far away, and they don’t ever talk or text. Barely even during birthdays and holidays.
* I take care of all shopping, cooking, most of the housework and work full time.

Basic relationship timeline:

Year one: Honeymoon period, everything as good as can be expected living with depression.

Year two: She slowly starts withdrawing affection, has the wish for a cat.

Year three: We get the most wonderful cat, helps her emotional state, but my affection nearly ends.

Year four: Affection towards me is entirely gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the long version, brace yourself:

My girlfirned and I have been a couple since winter of 2013, officially moved in together around February 2014. Known her since March 2007. We're both in our early thirties.

She is from a neighboring country, we originally met over the Internet back in '07.

She has been suffering from depression most of her life, has social anxiety and what I can best describe as a worthless family. Parents don't engage with her, nor seem to care about her, almost no contact, maybe once or twice a year over the phone, without much ""real"" care for her, just empty talk. She has grown to resent them.

Her parents split up when she was very young, her mother moved around a literal dozen (12) times (and moved far enough every time to rip friendships apart) before she turned young adult. This has more or less broken her ability to naturally form friendships, leading to a string of bad to abusive relationships, mostly built over the internet and her then moving in with then. I have always treated her well and been kind, I spent around 6 years watching her go from one bad relationship to another. She was afraid that going with me, would turn me into another asshole, or worse, she'd lose me.

That is now closer than I want to admit. The losing me part, don't want to be the asshole.

When she finally started to pay ""real"" attention to me, I was thrilled, I have loved her pretty much since the beginning, but the problem with ""loving"" someone over the Internet is that you see them through the ultimate filter, online, you can hide what hurts and only show what you want.

During the 6-something years before we became an item, I would meet her a fair few times, see her ugly sides, the depression, all the crap she had filtered. And I still loved her just as much.

When she found out, that even though she'd shown me her worst, and I still hadn't run away screaming, she and I started a short dating period before moving in together.

One thing that I chose to ignore at the time, and I suppose have just put away until now, is that one major catalyst for her finding out I still loved and wanted her in 2013, was that she was more or less headed straight for another abusive relationship, also with a guy met on the net, this guy was more up front about being an ass though, which I suppose is something. At the time I was closer to the Gay Best Friend than anything else, so I got all the juicy details, from the fact that she'd sent nudes to her enjoying him being the ""bad boy"", much like all the others.

I couldn't have it, and one day when she was visiting, I told her that if she met this guy and let him fuck her over in more ways I care to describe, I would leave, for good. Couldn't watch her go through yet another asshat.

At that point, he had bought tickets and was supposed to drop by her place not a week later. She told him thanks but no thanks, he got furious for having been let on, but she eventually chose to break the cycle. Good on her!

When we started dating, as a test she came to stay at my place for a while. She was tentative about touches at first, hugs and such was a no-no, as if she wanted to keep distance just in case I magically would turn into the biggest ass ever seen. She let me touch her though, she told me she enjoyed it, but she was stiff as a board and physically very anxious.

Not a week into our experimental dating, that changed, she grabbed my hand during a walk, and half a year of daily affection started. The full monty, from a hug when returning home to her waking me for a fifth go because she just wanted me to take her so badly, again.

It was awesome, my dream come true, she hadn't changed her personality one bit becoming my girlfriend, same fun and sweet girl, her aversion to physical closeness was gone and even though her previous boyfriends had broken trust and even forced themselves on her, she wanted me, and let me in.

The depression however, was of course ever present, but the newfound love and excitement helped a bit I guess, she would help around the house, do dishes and cook.

She would not want to go shopping alone, social anxiety and such. She came with me to some family events with my family, but her depression kept her from some major ones I honestly would have loved to have her by my side at. I never forced her to any of them, also to this day, but a few of them she smelled me wanting her to come, and got resentful, almost angry. We talked it through, and she calmed down, but I quickly got the feeling that any and all family events was of no interest, so I have over the years just gone on my own. She does come for Christmas, but ain't happy about it.

After a while, I'd guess a year to year and a half, the wanting me had almost stopped. No hugs, not even a morning have-a-good-day hug. Very rarely she would come cuddle, when watching movies we would sit next to one another, she didn't lean on me, if I put my arm around her she'd more often than not grunt and tell me it's uncomfortable, so wanting to give her space I stopped.

She gradually stopped banging me like it was her only purpose in life, of course the ""honeymoon"" period is a bit crazy, but up into a year or so into the relationship we made love at least once a day, in lovely and imaginative ways. The half or so year to the drought, she'd just slowly stop coming to bed with me, stay up later and later.

All of her previous boyfriends have looked at other girls, both in real life and porn, so she really hated the idea of me doing that. So I didn't, love and such makes you do crazy things!

As she had less and less sex with me, she still supplemented with blowjobs, good ones, she'd let me finish in her mouth, she would seem to enjoy it. Later it turned to handjobs with the rare short blowjob, but no longer would she let me finish any other way than with her hand. All of a sudden blowjobs was off the menu, noted that were disgusting, even.

Then the handjobs got terrible, I remember her nearly falling asleep on more than one occasion, so I started fantasising about how we used to go at it, then later whatever it took to finish, so she wouldn't get sad and feel useless because she couldn't even make me finish. Wasn't proud of thinking up a fantasy girl to help me get off, but my real girl barely put in any effort.

Very rarely, maybe three to five times a year or so, not on birthdays or other special events, but only after we'd talked about me needing closeness, she's have sex with me. She would ride me, because she knows she can make me finish fast. If I take the lead, everything is either uncomfortable or hurtful, even though we'd done it plenty, and spooning, missionary and doggy shouldn't be hurtful. I ain't that big of a guy!

My girlfriend is not my girlfriend, she's my roommate, and a shit one at that.

I do all the shopping, she might come with me to one in twenty or less, and only after I've asked repeatedly.

I do the vast majority of the housework, taking out trash, doing dishes, cleaning the drains.

I do \*all\* of the cooking. Every time I ask what she wants for dinner, she can't decide, she has also turned way picky over the years. We have tried anything from planning dishes ahead of time to a randomised system from a pool of by-her approved dishes. But the pick of the day is rarely accepted. We've had it recently, bad it too much, she don't feel like it or all of a sudden really doesn't like half the ingredients.

I don't really get any meaningful attention, no hug when I get home, if I'm lucky I get a hello, sometimes a decently happy voice, which makes me a little happy, but mostly it's a can-I-really-be-bothered Hello.

She doesn't leave the computer when I get home, if I've been shopping and ask her it's 50/50 if she even reacts to me asking, if she does hear me (because who'd take their headphones off, just because their roommate got home, right?), she sometimes comes to help, but most often says ""hold on.."" because she wants to finish what she's doing in the MMO she's playing.

I almost always text her when leaving the grocery store, so she could easily finish up and be ready for when I get home.

Oh did I mention we don't own a car? So I have to carry the groceries by hand, might need a bit of help when getting home, but most of the time I also take care of that on my own.

She can spend all night playing her MMO, till the morning when I get up sometimes, she seems to prioritize it higher and higher, once upon a time she spent a lot of time talking with one particular person, and she admitted him being of the bad boy category, and somewhat found herself attracted, but it was very short and I like that she told me, not keeping it a secret.

She streams playing video games, has for years, gives her something to do, which I think is very important.

But we used to have three days set aside every week for watching movies, series, just being us, but it's been almost a year since we had those three, because the MMO also needed time. It started out small, just one of the three, and just a few hours, but now it's every day, every week.

She sits there and plays, talking with them on voice, she seems happy, laughs, makes jokes, something she haven't done with me in what seems like forever.

We do talk a bit every day, her tone of voice is often on the friendly side, but it is just that, the friendly side. It doesn't feel very girlfriendy. I’m well aware that the depression has a huge hand in this, and never blamed her personally for it.

I have talked to a select few about all this, my best friend directly says he thinks she's well aware of my good heart and is taking advantage of me, that she has no love left. I would not necessarily disagree with him, but I also believe she never meant any harm by it.

My doctor says he recognizes our relationship as being me as a caretaker and her as a person who most likely won't recover from her problems.

Every help forum I read tells me it's not my responsibility to repair her, and that I should get out.

If we were to part, I wanted to take away as many of the unpleasant things as I could, I planned several ways for her to move home to her own country, planned a few ways for her to stay in this country, how to find her an apartment of her own and such.

So about four days ago, I told her. I want out. With my best laid plans in hand, I told her.

She didn't even see it coming, got very sad and cried. I for a moment found myself seriously doubting my decision, she begged very kindly if I would reconsider, that she felt like she did not have a chance to fix anything. After some silence, I told her I needed a little me-time to figure things out.

Since then, I've slept on a spare bed in my mother's home, but I have come visit her a few times to talk things out.

She really wants to change, went shopping on her own and even offered to cook me dinner again.

Critically, I asked her if she remembers the last time she felt love for me, she went quiet, not knowing the answer.

I am not sure what I want. Part of me want back what we had. Part of me realizes that what we had might even have been a lie, her needing someone to be there, and now she's just happy having someone help her every day, me telling her it's over, she's finally willing to do something.

Part of me recognizes that even if we actually \*had\* something, \*real\*, that it will never be like that again.

But part of be also fears that leaving her for good will crush her entirely, possibly bringing her to suicide or self-harm.

I do still feel some level of love for her, otherwise I imagine I would have left long ago.

I know I cannot live without any closeness or sex, and I can't keep doing near everything for two people. Even if she can make her change, I have no idea if it will stick.

And \*making\* her change? I am clearly forcing her to, when the only other option is leaving. That is just so wrong to me, I am well aware of how depression messed with you in unspeakable ways, but it shouldn't have to come to this, she should, at least in my book, even if depressed, have wanted to improve over the years, right?

When she has made small changes, it's because I tell her what I need and want, historically what I got was not very genuine, nor long lasting.

All the things I she does do, she does well, and I praise her whenever she does do something.

I leave her for good:

She has to either forge her own path in my country, or be forced to go ""home"" to a family she does not want to have. I have been a solid source of support for over a decade, I can't imagine her taking it well. We have a cat whom I have grown deeply attached to, she would be taking the cat, because she needs her more than I do, especially if we split.

I stay:

No way around it, I would have to tell her all the things that need to change, and the list is long and scary.

Making people change with what is essentially a threat, I don't like the taste that leaves in my mouth. Will she take it well, or will it just be the slow and even more painful route to eventually leaving? I don't know.

Right now I’m getting messages from her daily, one more desperate than the other, I feel really sorry for her, want to rush home and tell her it’s all gonna be alright. But I haven’t even figured out if I can be there with her, to make it alright, in the long run.

So, Reddit..

55,"It’s going to be a bit long but I really need help. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, just ideas of what it could be if it’s anything at all.

- I have low empathy and sympathy towards humans. I definitely wouldn’t hurt someone or an animal out of boredom or for fun though. I did have a few fantasies about torturing some people but it doesn’t happen often and I would never act on them. 
- I’m definitely not apathetic.
Like I feel sad if someone I love dies, even though I move on easily.
- I get angry easily and i happen to have the urge to punch/hurt someone but i never act on it. Like sometimes I have this urge to punch the person I’m arguing with and just smash their face. Just seeing their face makes me want to hurt them. It happens that I get physical with my parents at times and hurt them but it’s never anything BAD, just a bit of blood or a bruise. I would never kill them or send them to the hospital. 
- i’m manipulative ever since i was born (and i’ve seen my parents desperate because of it)
- I SOMETIMES lack guilt (like, I hurt my best friend’s feelings and she really hated me and not only I didn’t feel guilty for hurting her, but I also didn’t care that she hated me? Or I don’t feel bad for hurting my parents when I do).
- i used to have social anxiety but it’s been getting better.
- I don’t get close to people easily. I consider friends people I’ve been close to ever since I was 2 and that’s it. Everyone else is just a person I know.
- I don’t understand people that are too good or something. I can’t explain it. It’s like people who are so good and empathetic make me want to throw up or something. I’m not a bad person and I don’t do bad things, I just can’t understand all this empathy, morality, sympathy... there’s this girl in my class who LOVES being a justice warrior for her friends against the teachers and I’m like bruh? They can speak up against the teacher themselves. What’s with this charity.


I think that’s it? Nothing else comes to my mind.

I do have friends and love them and they all agree on me being like this. God knows how many times I’ve heard saying I’m going to abandon them. I mean, if I want to move to the other side of the world and our friendship is still okay, then good. If it ends, amen. 
I go to a psychologist but I don’t think she’s really useful, I go there just because she listens to me and I’m talkative. It’s just another person who listens to me talking about my week.
I don’t want to change my approach with her nor get diagnosed cause even if I had something I don’t think I’d be a problem to anyone. Being officially diagnosed would be a problem to me. So yeah.
They also sent me to a psychiatrist once but he was a superficial asshole and we didn’t have a proper talk or anything (I mean there were my parents inside the room with us. C’mon). It was when I was 14, now I’m 18.

I’ve always been told I’m manipulative and I’ve never thought it was a problem, then my friends started feeling uncomfortable about my low empathy. They joke about me getting angry for any petty thing while my parents are actually worried about it. My mom has started saying she’s scared of talking to me cause I get aggressive. That was the bell that had me thinking there might be an actual problem.

Honestly though, I don’t think I’ve ever had any trauma in my life. All my bad memories don’t feel “strong” enough to be called traumas. My parents love me (even though I’m pretty sure both of them have undiagnosed mental illnesses - my dad switches mood SUDDENLY and gets really angry suddenly, feels verbally abusive and ruins the mood every day, he had a traumatic childhood and has traumatic memories of war as a soldier; my mom has had diagnosed depression ever since she was 20 and a slight alcohol addiction).
I’ve never had huge social problems because I know what the social common sense is.

Is there any mental illness that could explain all this? I’ve thought of ASPD but it seems like people with ASPD are apathetic while I can feel all emotions and have low (not complete lack, of depends on the situation) empathy, sympathy and sense of guilt. Does borderline ASPD even exist? Or could it be something else?

56,"We were together for about 3 to 4 months and spent a short amount of time living together. She'd often throw her problems on me and expect me to assist while dismissing all my issues.

When I'd have panic attacks she would guilt trip me after, telling me to stop having them around her or she'd break up with me. Making me worship/apologize to her while treating me like i was nothing. 

For the longest time I didn't see the red flags. She would make me feel like shit continuously; wether it was purposeful or not i still haven't figured out.  After every fight I'd have to be the one to apologize. She told me it was because she didn't think apologies had any value, and that's why she never made them. In retrospect it raises the question of why I still had to apologize for everything.

 I became good friends with one of her good friends; and when the relationship ended i found a lot of comfort confiding in her. While i wasn't talking to or about her anymore; she told me i had to stop talking to her friend because that friend meant everything to her. 

I did out of respect, (as her friend said she didn't believe my ex was the kind of person that would make her choose between me or her.)
My ex hadn't spoken to that all important friend for two months before telling me i should quit.

We used to have kinky sex but she'd refuse to touch me. At times she would accuse me of abuse for what we consensually did in the bedroom. Telling me her not saying her safeword was my fault. I was wrong. I was abusive. In retrospect, she'd used her safeword or tap without issue enough times for it to not be my fault.

She'd tell me i was abusive and controlling, knowing full and well i was a past victim of abusive and cheating. That i shouldn't expect her to talk to me. She used to promise me she'd text me when she got home safe. Only to forget and call me overly controlling when i freaked out in fear of her being kidnapped. 

When i confessed to her i was a Victim of sexual abuse this behavior only increased.

In retrospect; I'm still afraid she was right about all of it.

Today she texted me a final time. She told me i ruined her life. That i was abusive. That she was raped since we'd split up. (I can't read that horrible word without having flashbacks. She's aware of this)

She told me she was blocking me so i could never reply. 

She denied me closure.

I was doing fine before she texted me. I was working on music and working out. I hadn't been sad in weeks.

Now i'm the saddest I've been in my life. Resisting the urge to throw up for an hour; and afraid this post sounds like another woe is me post. 

I'm afraid i'll be laughed at and told to man up.

I'm really scared because I'll be on my own taking care of myself for the first time.  No safety net of parents (they're dead) or husband.  I've relied on my husband for years to help me fill out paperwork and be on time, etc.

I've occasionally gone to mental health professionals.  They have been uniformly useless and made me feel worse about myself.  None of them tried to diagnose my mental problems/learning disorder.  Only the general practitioner has ever bothered to give me medication.  The last counselor got mad the second time I missed an appointment and said I ""didn't care enough about my therapy.""

I hear, over and over again, how people are over medicated from ""easy"" diagnoses of ADD, depression, anxiety and I want to scream.

Due to the credit card company making a mistake I have surplus credit.  I can afford expensive over-the-counter non-prescription drugs.  Some of them suggest that they are powerful and should be monitored by a doctor, so I made a list of the symptoms I want to treat.  Just making the list made me feel sick with anxiety.

I will make a list of the drugs I intend to try and will run them by the general practitioner.  This way, they can actually do their job instead of parceling out as few drugs as possible to make sure I don't abuse them, ensuring that I always run out before the next appointment--which I always forget.

66,"The title really says it all. I’m going to let myself be a bit cocky here and say I am one of the smarter and more athletic guys in my year at school. I train and study hard and, majority of the time, it shows. But whenever something happens e.g. I don’t get a time in a race I was aiming for, I mess something up I know I can do, someone I know I’ve trained more than and am better than beats me, etc, I beat myself up and just ending up hating myself for maybe a day or two. I would love nothing more than to stop this but I just can’t. I’ve been told to lower my expectations of myself, but it’s not that simple, so I was wondering if anyone here could help me with my recurring issue.

Any advice is appreciated and thank you so much in advance for any help you can give!",31Aug2018,2
67,"Ok so for the past 4 months or so now I've been struggling with anxiety/depression following my first break-up. Focusing on my future is hard, going to school is hard so I took a break this fall, and working is hard. The problem is, I want to be doing these things. I just figured it would be a poor idea to go to school this fall--the stress levels were way too high, and nothing had even started yet. I did go to a few lectures and nothing inside me sounded anything promising for the rest of the semester. If 2 months off in the summer didn't do it for me then I didn't see it getting any better at school.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked a very, very easy job over the summer as an usher. Every work shift felt like a grind regardless, and all I had to do was stand there most of the time and check tickets/help people find their seats and things like that. I stopped working in hopes of transitioning to school but that did not pan out as I explained above. It did help a little bit with the ""moving forward,"" aspect; I just felt this attraction towards one chick that was like that ""love at first sight"" thing which gave me hope but other than that I don't feel I truly got any sort of mental gain from the experience in spite of talking with co-workers, fans, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

All the while I waited 3 months for my first therapy appointment--I honestly should have called and tried to take cancellations during this time, but I felt kind of hopeless after they told me I'd have to wait three months and also wanted to try and stick it out by working and doing all the healthy habits that I was used to doing. I wanted to work through this the normal way. I tried other things too, like going on a road trip with a friend, and even went on a trip out of the country with my grandma. Nothing worked though. It felt like a high-functioning depression and constant anxiety. I tried antidepressants through a GP but they gave me bad anxiety side effects after just a few days (seeing colors, felt like I was entering an LSD trip).

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the sum of my life feels like my guitar, a TV show, and a lingering curiosity for the unknown. I play the guitar because it's proven to be something I can chip away at and it eases my mind ever so slightly. I watch a pretty good TV show in the morning, I just like the characters and it touches on real topics. But I've been more prone to binging a few episodes the last few days. Lastly, I still want to get better. I don't want to be depressed the rest of my life. It just feels like my whole life has been sucked away by this experience. I have been stressed out many times in my life however and made it through, but I fear that I've finally just gone too far or something. I liked doing hard work: the gym, math, stressful things that many people didn't like. It gave me pleasure, pride, a lot of positive emotions. Now, doing hard work seems pointless and I also don't know if I even like doing anything in life that isn't the ""hard work"" kind of stuff. I just don't feel anything from doing things most of the time. I tried going for a hike the other day and while it was fine, 90% of my thoughts were on the relationship and I could hardly focus on being ""in the moment."" Meditation is nice, but it makes me feel crazy still because it's like my brain doesn't want to not think about negative things. I literally counted to 400 something breaths yesterday just to give you an idea of why it drives me a little nuts lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I got an internship and interviewed and took it and everything. But honestly I'm not sure how I'll do at it. I don't even know if I'll be able to stick it out for the whole fall/winter. It's about 5 days of work a week, and I have absolutely no motivation for it other than that I'd need money to pay a $45/month gym contract. It's just the damn depression and anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm seeing a psychiatrist for the first time and trying meds again, it's been about 4 or 5 days, but then I hear people say that meds don't help or that they only mask symptoms. I don't understand what the point is then or how I will get past this. They have helped relieve some anxiety I feel like and made it easier to think about some things but I don't know I mean I don't want them to solve my problems but I do feel like I need help. I feel like I've been ruminating a little more about my relationship since starting some of them but I think that is just normal emotions, like now that I've gotten to the help I still have to face these feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally got my first therapy appointment this past week. Then I found out it wasn't weekly, which sucked. She suggested intensive group therapy (3-4x a week) but it conflicts with the internship and honestly I didn't know which to choose so I chose the internship.  My next therapy appointment is technically in october, so I have to call and take cancellations. She said she just wanted me to be seeing one therapist, not trying to see multiple, so I guess I will try to stick with her. But I won't be afraid to change if I need to. I'm just kind of upset about the lack of therapists and availability for help. They tell you to reach out for help but it takes months to get an appointment and it's not even a consistent thing? Maybe I'm asking too much, but so far I feel like I've only scratched the surface of my issues. I just don't know anymore. I hope the rest of my life isn't spent in a depressive episode, or going in and out, or whatever. It just doesn't make sense

68,Well the title kind of says it. So school is about to open and I am really not ready for it. I keep on crying and I literally can't stop and there is no one to talk to about this. I am in the middle of a really long art homework which isn't finished as well as a lot of other summer homework and school is opening next Thursday and I feel so low that I feel as if the world would be such a better place if I didn't exist. I have very little motivation for next year and I am going to be lonlier than ever because my older brother is going to uni and I don't want to face social anxiety in school. ,31Aug2018,1
69,"I've got a lot of issues. All of which are undiagnosed and I'm not a fan of self diagnosis by any means. So i'll take these responses with a grain of sand. To cut to the chase, my current situation is about my ability to recuperate after a confrontation. After the beginning of what would be an argument with my mom, I left the situation to breath. She texted me, and soon it was pretty bad. We both apologized by the end of it and as I hadn't seen her in a while she asked me to rejoin the room. I couldn't. I really couldn't. Believe me I wanted to. I was over the situation and in no way was upset with my mom. The moment I entertained the idea of going into that room with my mom to enjoy the day, my mind blanks. Any time I think about walking into that room I can't think. I don't know why but that's how it is. I didn't want to be difficult. I knew phsyically I was perfectly capably of walking in. I couldn't bring myself to do it though. What's sad is I wanted to be in that room with her. I just didn't know how to talk to her after that situation. Please help me and leave anything that may be helpful in the comments. I'm absolutely desperate.",31Aug2018,2

71,"Ive been playing a video game all morning and ive been completely envelped in it. Mind you i barely play videogames so im not a gamer or doing this all the time. Immediately after playing i was fine but like 30 minutes later i tuned into aretha franklins memorial service on tv and chacka khans singing made me cry. At this point i noticed detachment from these emotions and i noticed i was crying but i seemed to feel fine inside so i felt it was weird. I started to feel a little bit of panic from this and so i decided to take ashower. As i was in the shower i started feeling detached from my feelings sensations and thoughts and i started feeling like my body was a puppet that i was operating. I also started to feel similar to when i had a psychotic episode back in february. After the shower i felt shaky and weak and i ate some bread and butter as all ive had to eat today was loads of coffee. Then i took a walk and tried to come back to a normal place noting to myself that i felt fine yesterday and ill feel fine again eventually. I took deep breaths and walked around the block and now i feel more normal. What could this be?

Edit* i took some risperidone but i still feel slightly anxious and my thoughts are like voices. For example when i step outside i can hear my thought saying ""it feels nice outside"". Usually i wouldnt be aware of that thought, id just feel it. I still do not feel right.",31Aug2018,2
72,"Sorry if this isn’t the right place, a friend recommended I try reddit about something else so I thought I’d put this here too. Warning, VERY long!

I don’t blame you if you think I’m egotistical, but here goes: I’m nearly perfect. I can play any part, I’m intelligent, adaptable, likable, strong, good at almost everything I’ve ever tried, and absolutely stunning to boot. It might sound narcissistic but everyone I’ve met certainly seems to think so too based on my success getting what I want. I’ve manipulated people since I was in elementary school. Long story short, I figured out that people will do anything if I make them think it’ll give them something they want badly enough. Fast forward to middle school, I started taking playing with people seriously, and I mostly focused on boys until high school.

A lot of boys liked the witty flirt persona I liked putting on at the time. I wrapped them around my fingers and played them off each other for fun, then one in particular got my attention. He was even more attached than most, he started showing up around me outside of class, following me around like a puppy and failing to make conversation. I didn’t know that I could tell him to leave me alone, but even if I had known, I’m not sure it would have changed anything. Instead, I made him become increasingly infatuated, giving him attention and affection, then pulling back sharply as soon as he asked for more. I had read that nothing makes people more attached than intermittent love and rejection, and it worked perfectly.

I got bored though, and I totally ignored him for a few months. Then came the end of year dance. I didn’t want to go, but my friends pressured me and I still hadn’t realized I could just refuse people, and didn’t want to lie to them, so I went (there’s my selective caring about people again). Of course, he was there and he followed me around the whole night. He was being annoying and of course I didn’t think to just tell him to go away, so I started talking to him. Getting him comfortable, telling him what he wanted to hear, and he of course asked me to dance, then to date him. I accepted both requests, then set up my final trap: I made a joke that it would shock one of my friends to see me kiss him. He took the bait, and we did kiss. It was my first kiss, I felt nothing. He was a bad kisser. Still, he mistook my adrenaline from the lying (which I find exhilarating) for what he was feeling. He kissed me again on our way out when the dance ended. That weekend we texted nonstop, I kept winding him tighter, saying “I love you” then leaving for an hour, or “You’re so attractive” then “Sorry, I have practice now!”, driving him insane and making him want to see me. Come Monday he was waiting for me outside the school, of course. I saw him, and realized he would try to kiss me again, and I was repulsed and ready for the most fun part by now. He approached me and I just said “I don’t love you” and walked away. He showed up at my locker, acting nervous, confused. I just said I was serious, and that I didn’t love him as callously as I could. I relished the expression on his face when he realized I meant it. I still love the look in his eyes when he sees me, hurt and confused even after almost two years. I love how he leaves rooms when I walk in, how he tells his friends he’ll get revenge on me. I love how I stick in his brain, yet I can’t even remember his name.

It’s been a year and a half since, and he’s old news at this point. Since then I’ve played more finessed games, some with people at my school, some outside. These were less final though, they’re time killers at best. The thing is, I want to do it again, I want to rip someone’s heart out and stomp it into the ground. I want to figure out what makes them tick and then put out every single gear and leave them hollow.

The thing is, I don’t always want this. It’s the most common, but I often feel bad about what I’ve done, and about what I want to do. I’m still able to care about people, but it’s a conscious choice if I want to be kind or callous. Since the issue at the end of middle school I’ve been more kind than not, but I only do it because I don’t want to commit to being callous for the rest of my life. I fear that if I cause too much damage then being kind will become too painful for me. The problem is, restraining myself is becoming harder and harder. The middle school issue was also caused by me being too controlled, but I don’t know what to do. I can’t explain why I’m like this, or what the goal is, so I guess I’d like to hear your thoughts on what’s wrong with me. I’m not sure if I’ll do it because this is who I am, but you’re welcome to tell me how to change too.

TL;DR I’m a knifing harpy and I love it. Until I don’t. Thoughts?",31Aug2018,5
73,"Hello I don't know if this is the place to ask but we're all concerned about my brother. It's really frustrating and kind of worrying my family and we're feeling more and more alienated from him on a daily basis. I was hoping if perhaps somebody could give some pointers. We just want to know what's wrong and how we can help him.  


He's always acted a bit strange just in general but we just put that down to him having a bit of an eccentric personality.   
He tends to go through phases where he becomes obsessed with things only to discard them after a few weeks - often spending 100s of pounds on something which he may only touch once if at all.   
Generally acts quite fussy and likes things to be kept in a very specific condition. For example, if I turn out the light in the kitchen (during daytime) he will turn it on again seconds after. Once got violent because I wouldn't turn my music down and pushed me to the ground.  


He generally has no concept of other people's property or personal space but demands that people respect his own (such as touching me if I take my top off, entering my room and sitting on my bed when it's night time and I'm trying to sleep, using my toiletries without asking, etc), but if I were to use his laptop he would be aggravated.  


There is a sense of your relationship with him being compartmentalized. Conversations are only ever surface level and different people get different levels of access to his personal life which he is incredibly protective over. If you ask or talk about something personal with him he can get very snappy.   


Has great social skills and has no trouble making friends or striking conversations with complete and total strangers. He gets along with people really well even though he says he is an introvert.   


Has been becoming increasingly distant and now refuses now to join us on family days out, meals, or planned events and seemingly takes no interest in maintaining familial relationships often complaining about tiredness but there is no sign of any kind of anger or upset from him which is strange because he normally loves meetups.  


I was worried perhaps my brother could be traumatized. My siblings and I were raised by a narcissistic parent who abused us mentally in the most horrific ways. This caused lasting emotional damage to us and left me with PTSD. The only thing is that my brother has always been this way since a child but it has only just become obvious enough that we have started to consider that perhaps he may have a mental condition of some form. I'm quite familiar with developmental conditions such as autism which would explain but can't be sure myself. If anybody has any ideas it would help us to research and perhaps we could better understand and help him.  


Thank you.",31Aug2018,1

75,"This is basically me putting out a largish multitude of things that have lead me to question the state of my mind and lead me to believe theres something wrong with me, but i can't quite determine what it is- so I'm hoping someone can offer an answer. 

To put it as simply as possible, emotions to me feel.... flat. Most of the time, I just feel nothing, and when I do feel something, it's very monotone and falls short of what is expected- especially for darker, more serious situations. As an example of this, years ago, when my grandmother died, I felt no ""genuine"" emotion- i didn't shed a single tear. The grief I pulled up was all derived from me consciously thinking that I should be more upset, trying to force myself into having the emotions i should have. yet another example is when a friend of mine was depressed, and I got screenshots of messages from a third party friend in which she stated that she wanted to kill herself. Consciously, through tangible thought,of course, I was concerned- I quickly contacted her parents, and she is currently getting help. But on an emotional scale, i again felt mostly nothing- none of the immense stress, panic and hysteria that situation ought to have caused me. I care deeply for my friends and family, of course, and would never do harm to them (well, with the exception of typical sister-brother shenanigans) yet, especially in terms of family, I can't find that warm, blazing love that so many describe it to be. (indeed, i currently identity as asexual) As a result, this has left me incredibly fearful for future events that ought to have tears or concern spent on, because I worry that my ""emotionlessness"" will mark me as a horrible excuse for a human being, not just in stark truth but also in the eyes of others- for what kind of person doesn't cry over the death of loved one, or nearly go mad with concern when a friend is in danger?

In terms of emotions like joy, This is too is very monotone; I've never felt excessively happy over something, and as a result in situations where i should be happier i put forth a sort of ""artificial"" happiness and excitement to meet the norm. Examples of this are when i am surprised by something very nice- a party, an iPad, or a trip to somewhere during the summer. I've never felt nearly as joyful over these events as i should be- and while it doesnt meant i do not appreciate these things wholeheartedly,  if i displayed my true emotions, i would probably be marked as ungrateful and picky. The only real emotions I feel in full force is nervousness and fear when I am in a spot of genuine physical danger. But even then the feelings wear off almost as soon as there is no longer danger, and as i result those incidents don't make the imprint or impression one would expect, like trauma- instead, i always regard them as an amusing and thrilling tale to tell in an offhand, casual manner. 

It's entirely possible that I'm being silly and self absorbed, but I'm genuinely concerned about  whether or not theres something wrong with my brain- like sociopathy, and that I'm by nature really a bad person held back only by conscious thought. Thoughts? ",31Aug2018,1
76,"Hello, i'm 23M, and I have ADHD. I was diagnosed when I was very young and was medicated for many years. By time I was on year 9 of my schooling I had, had a very hectic morning and was running late for the bus because I didn't wake up to my alarm clock. Somewhere along the line I had accidently taken my medicine 3 times as I kept trying to get everything I needed together and forgetting if I did. Keep in mind I was still waking up so that really contributed to my mistake. I was in such a rush by the time I was sitting on the bus I was questioning if I had even remembered to take it. Not even halfway through my first class of the day I was freaking out. Now, normally my mind is racing and i'm thinking about a bunch of things. With my meds (maybe stratera? Idr if that was what i was on at the time or the correct spelling.) It helped that problem so I could focus. But I guess if you take more than prescribed it just ramps everything up by 1000x. So I was there siting in class, mind running at 1000mph. My head was hurting, sounds were sharp and I just remember putting my head in my arms on my desk, trying to calm myself down. Well this went on for what seemed like forever. Tried sleeping right when I got home and it took hours. It was easily one of the worst days of my life. From that point on I decided I was never taking medication again. Years later, here I am approaching 24. If you expect me to say something about how my life is perfect and I did it all without medication. You're wrong. My life is pretty much screwed and the only reason i'm not homeless is because of my parents. Now for many years I lived without them, i had no health insurance, and to this day I have not seen a doctor for over 5 years. I used to go to a psychologist weekly, haven't done that in over 4 years. I guess the whole point of this post is I have been struggling for years amd finally I'm realizing I have a problem and I don't think i'm capable of focusing without my medication. Ive asked my parents if they could help, but they just simply can't afford it right now, which isn't there fault. I struggle keeping jobs as I have episodes every now and then where I just go on month long freak outs or something and everyday is just awful. I have a hard time every day just normally, but recently I started having a lot of anxiety and random panic attacks. I desperately want help but I just dont know what to do at this point. Its putting a strain on my family and my girlfriend and like I told her, all I want is just clarity. I want my mind to be clear for once and not so clouded with all the shit I deal with every day. Medication is the only thing that will help. But where do I start? How do I get medication if I can't even find a job? I've had so many jobs that my work history is a page full and no one wants to hire me. Its been almost 8 months since my last job. Ive only gotten 4 job interviews and none of them offered me a position. I just really want to be on medication and go to a psychologist again so i can find out if theres more wrong with me. Because the previous 2 i had i was never truthful with because I was threatened with being sent to like a psych ward when I was younger, and I didnt want that. Now i just want to br honest. I really want help. Hope someone can point me in the right direction because i dont know what to do. ",31Aug2018,2
78,"Hi! I’m new here (literally just made an account for this question) and have no idea where to put this, but I’ve been having some weird memories going on in my head. I feel like maybe someone could give me some advice or something like that?

So, when I was from the ages of 2-4 I was in a preschool/daycare. It was fun, I really liked it and everything, from what I can remember. 
I was invited to my first friend’s house maybe around 3 or 4 years old. It’s hard for me to remember since it was 13-14 years ago. I’m 16. In the house, I remember walking down this hallway. I remember my friend had gone down to her room at the end of the hallway. I was trailing behind her, a little bit shy of being in a house without my mom. I assume she dropped me off there. She may have been downstairs, I don’t remember well. 

Anyways, on the right side of the hallway was an open door leading to a room. From the hallway I can see that there’s a person laying on the bed. Like an adult or teenager at least. That’s one thing I remember from going to her house. It was weird because it’d always come up in my head throughout my life. I didn’t think much of it. It was the only snippet of info I had from that day. Now, I have a terrible memory and it’s hard for me to recall things. So it’s weird that I remember going over to a friends house at age 3 or 4. Anyways, I was thinking about it recently, and I recall what the inside of the room was. But I shouldn’t be able to recall what the inside of the bedroom looked like if I was looking at it while passing, through a cracked door. So then that’s when I start thinking. I like halfway remember them calling me inside the room and getting up on the bed. That’s all. And it dawned at me that it seems strange for an adult to tell a 
young toddler to get up on the bed with them. 

Fast forward to now, I feel really weird and uncomfortable around certain smells. I remember the upstairs of home smelled like I think cigar smoke. There’s this certain cologne that I can’t bear to be around it makes me so uncomfortable. 

So my question is, do you think there was some sort of abuse going on here that I’m just now beginning to recall? And even so, wouldn’t I have remembered all of the details if it really were that traumatic? ",31Aug2018,4
