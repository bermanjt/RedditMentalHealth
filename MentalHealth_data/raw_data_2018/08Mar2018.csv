2,"Okay first off: I am safe. 

 But I need help. I feel like no one is listening to me! For 2.5 years I’ve struggled with extreme anxiety and panic attacks, subsequently I have also been battling depression off and on. I take Zoloft 75mg, and Xanax as needed. I have have success with smoking small amounts of cannabis but unfortunately we currently live on federal property so I cannot have it in my home. Anyway, the past few months I feel like I am just falling deeper and deeper into a suicidal state because I am so damn sick of having anxiety and panic attacks. I get them multiple times a day. Sometimes they are so debilitating and intense that I convulse, vomit, and, sweat profusely. My husband does his best to help be but he’s not equipped to deal with this. My therapist says that suicidal thoughts are normal. I told my doctor that I had thoughts of suicide and she didn’t really say much other than “do you want to up your Zoloft?” But like... I don’t even think I’m depressed! I’m just so fucking fed up with the panic attacks. I need relief. It’s like my brain never shuts off. I feel like I am constantly operating at a level 9, and the second anything feels in my life changes, its full blown panic attack. And it’s always panic attacks due to hypochondria. I’m scared to death that I’m going to have a heart attack or a stroke or something really wild. 

Anyway.... I just don’t know what to do. I want to die. I need help and I feel like no one is listening to me. Does anyone have any words of advice? Because the suicidal thoughts are starting to scare the shit out of me. :( ",08Mar2018,1
3,"I am safe.

I am a college student who goes to university away from home. I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and ADHD for the nine eight years of my life. I am overweight and don't care much about my appearance. 

At school, I finally have a social life and friends after years and years of bullying and subsequent isolation. I am heavier than ever, but I am not too bothered by my weight. I take Vyvanse 50mg and Zoloft 100mg on a daily basis.

When I come home from university, my mother and I clash. She hates looking at me, hates that I pick my face and that I'm overweight. I just want her to stop. I feel like I can't tell her anything. 

This isn't a problem since I'm not a bad kid. However, when I was 14, I tried to kill myself. I have never told anyone nor have I ever tried again.

She says things such as ""I can't tell you how I feel because I'm worried you'll self-harm again."" or ""I can't afford to self-harm when I'm upset because I'm a parent.""

The only times I've ever cut myself is during my long breaks at home. She is personally offended that she is the cause of this.

13,"So I'm 18 and I'm taking online college classes full time. I have just put in my two week notice from my first job and my last day is Friday. I'm a big believer of going all out for the things that I want to do. I have a lot of dreams and I plan to go big and achieve a lot of things. I want to be a Graphic Designer, Computer Programmer, Book Author, and other things that are a little less professional, but a Comedy YouTube Channel and a Twitch Streamer as well. Now I do work little by little on all of these things at once and maybe that causes stress, but my problem is that I am WAY TOO ORGANIZED.

So I used to keep track of everything like exactly what I did at every minute of the day. I kept this stuff on Excel spreadsheets and it got too much that I did manage to quit, but there's one thing that I haven't quit yet. I make lists. i make schedules. This sounds harmless, I know, but it is getting so annoying that just saying the word, ""list"" or ""schedule"" honestly makes me sick and just so dead tired. Since I have all of these goals, I tend to keep busy, but I try to get a lot of it done at once. I will make a daily to-do list, then I will get annoyed with it after maybe an hour, or even 10 minutes after I make it, then i will make another one. I repeat this on a daily basis. I try telling myself, I want to do things that I want to do and no schedule or list is gonna help me do that. I try and get the pros and cons of keeping a schedule or list and it just doesn't work. I keep making a list or schedule, cancelling it, then redoing it over and over. It's keeping me from enjoying anything that I do. It's keeping me from getting a lot of stuff done. You probably won't believe me, but I've spent over 2 hours today making a list, and keep in mind that I worked 6 hours today. That is 2 hours that I could use to achieve something, instead I'm wasting time making lists, and it's such a problem I'm posting it to reddit. I'm not sure if the problem is that I am in a way being lazy and just procrastinating, or if I am dealing with something like OCD or Anxiety. It's too the point that when I play video games, something for fun, I get so frustrated and I have no fun playing it anymore. I don't know what it is, but I've posted something like this to other subreddits to try and get advice and none of it has worked. I'm hoping this does. Thanks.",08Mar2018,1
16,"If you're reading this then, like me, you have suffered with mental health. It may be you yourself who suffers with it or someone you really love and care about suffers with it. My partner of almost 5 years, Grace, has Borderline Personality Disorder, Chronic depression, Severe Anxiety and a few under undiagnosed issues. An she is my inspiration. In one way or another every single day is a struggle for her. No matter if it's a stranger buzzing on our flat, or the fact that our supermarket doesn't have what she was planning to make for dinner in stock, things of all nature in all different ways each effecting her in a way that is sometimes crippling. But she does it. Sure I'm there to help a little but she finds all different ways of coping and picking herself back up when all she wants to do is crawl into bed and cry until she passes out from exhaustion. I feel like the perseption of Mental health is stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment. It is either a complete stigma, that people just cannot wrap their minds around. Or somehow romanticized to be something it's not. Grace started a very honest, very real Mental health awareness page on Instagram recently, Neither of us have ever been big on the whole social media thing and it's only just starting out so if you want to check it out, please feel free.
I know that if just one person saw it an realised they weren't alone, it would all be worth it.

I replied, ""Yeah, my first tattoo was a semicolon on my hip and now I have a big water color piece on my leg."" I got the tattoo over the spot where I use to do self-harm. I got it because of the persona around it that it represents when someone could of killed themselves but choose to go on. I was suicidal for a long time but I am still here. He asked, ""did you get that tattoo for yourself."" I responded, ""yes"". He replied, ""God bless you."" It made my day.

20,"hello! I have been diagnosed with ptsd from things irrelevant to this, but lately, I have only been getting flashbacks to one thing, I'll just start to break down anytime I think about it and want to kill myself. 
long story short, my mom was drunk and we had a fight, she hit me (just once) and told me how terrible I was, said my full birth name (I'm transgender) and said that it's what I'll always be, how I'm a disappointment, a monster, selfish, etc. all because I wouldn't change my name and gender on my Facebook account 
obviously, this was settled and instantly when she started yelling (it started through text then she went into my room) I did it, although she didn't stop. 
I don't know why, I've had so many traumatic things happen but this has happened over 3 months or so ago and I still get so upset just thinking about it. if anything similar happens or she snaps at me, I'll instantly break down and think about what happened. it wasn't abuse, she's done things like this before but not nearly as bad as what she did this time. 
she's drunk right now and I heard her call my brother a jackass and all these things because he asked her and her boyfriend to be quieter (this only happens when her boyfriend is around as well)

32,"For the past two/three months I've been very anxious about pretty much everything. I'll think of one thing and then assure myself that it's fine and then move on to worry about something else. In my mind I exaggerate every situation. Even when I weigh out the positives and negatives of the situations I still can't cheer up or calm myself down. 

Sometimes, I will get brief moments (an hour at most) where I realise that everything is fine and I'm exaggerating stuff but then I suddenly begin worrying and panicking again without reason. 

Does this seem like anxiety? Depression? I'm unsure of what it is and really need a solution because it's almost constant worrying. Thank you!

I hate every aspect of my life. I met someone years ago. We were told we couldn't have children. Somehow it happened. Morally couldnt go through with an abortion, and I knew it'd crush the other person to adopt out our child. 
I hate being a parent. It's more than exhausting. Parent 2 had ""been there"" the whole time, but is nothing even close to a primary caregiver. For our child's first year of life, they literally never changed a diaper, dressed the child, or gave the child a bath. Caused by a mix of illness and physical disability. 
For a full year, I literally woke up every 3 hours to tend to every need. I had an emergency c section, and as soon as we all were home, I was the 24/7 caregiver. I never had a recovery break. 
In over 2 1/2 years, the longest ""break"" I ever had for myself was 9 hours. When parent 2 offers to give me a break, they can't handle it and call within 2 hours for backup. 
On top of it, I primarily deal with at least 75% of our day to day needs and errands. I manage the budget, bills, clean house, cook, keep everyone's schedule up to date, prepare all types of paperwork and research. 
I feel alone and isolated all the time. I'm supposed to be ""with' parent 2 but all they talk about is how they're failing because everyone and everything gets in their way. No acceptance of any responsibility for anything in their life. 
Here I am up at 6:09am. I haven't slept. Been up with the boy all day and night. Asked him to watch him a half hour ago parent 2 says ok. Doesn't. Proceeds to let him scream.

37,"Hey Reddit,

So last night I had to bring my close friend/neighbor to the emergency room/psych place because He is going mentally unstable. He has been traumatized by the death of a close friend. Myself and three other close friends are very worried about him, he's usually a really strong and self-reliant person, but now he's a shell of his former self. 

This started about a week ago, he attended the wake of the previously mentioned friend (he didn't make it to the funeral). At first he seemed normal, but last Saturday he went on a impromptu road trip with a girl he barely knows just so he could have thinking time. He slept there for 20 min and then drove back, he went from Rochester to NYC (5 hour drive). He rarely sleeps now, and I think his diet has also been really bad. After Saturday however, it got even worse. On in the afternoon he returned from his insane midnight trip. At first he was just very quiet, and he would just ignore me if i said something (At first I thought he just needed even more thinking time, so I wanted to give him some space and feel out where he was at). Over the course of the next couple of days he would develop more and more worrying traits, until Wednesday night when it was the worst. He constantly laughs to himself and then looks extremely sad after laughing, he is in denial and thinks his friend (the one that died) is somehow still alive, he hears voices in his head, extreme paranoia (he thinks he's going to get killed, last night it was extremely difficult to make him come with me to the hospital because he thought he would get killed if he left), and he was so sure that he saw somebody outside my balcony even after I went outside and assured him nobody was out there (he eventually ""believed"" me, but he would still snap his head back and look out the window constantly)

A lot of his symptoms sound like schizophrenia, but I'm not sure of his family history. It could very likely be schizophrenia (I'm no expert), because He's a hardcore stoner. To the best of my knowledge he has taken weed, lsd, cocaine, adderall, alcohol, and nicotine in the past. However, he knows a lot about drugs/where to get them since he used to be really into that ""business"" and he's more small time now, but it opens up the possibilities. 

I'm only looking to help my friend, any advice/tips would be very helpful. I don't have much resources as we're both just kids in college, but I have a car, some ""disposable"" money, and most importantly the trust of my friend (he's extremely paranoid, however it seems like I'm one of the few people that he trusts and knows will not hurt him, he's usually cooperative with me)


TLDR
Friend is extremely unstable/not at all like his usual self and exhibits symptoms similar to those described in cases of schizophrenia. He has a long and frequent history with drugs.

I will have my phone on me throughout the day so I will be able to respond to any PM's or replies. Anything at this point would be helpful, I will be contacting his family and letting them know the situation and such. ",08Mar2018,1

43,"I was neglected and abused as a child and it’s negatively affected my self esteem and relationships in my adult life. My therapist had me write a letter to my inner child. Here it is:

Dear child-me,

I am very sorry that you are suffering, overwhelmed, and in pain...and there is nobody around to comfort you.

You must feel so lonely and it must be so difficult to go through this all alone!!! It’s so scary and uncomfortable and really tough, but you know what? You’re going to make it through, okay???

I want you to know from this point forward, I will be here, with you, by your side, no matter what. You don’t have to go through this alone anymore. I’ll teach you how to get back up when you fall and show you how strong and tough you are! 

You are strong, beautiful, talented, kind, and funny! I want to shine the light on all of your positive traits and turn up the intensity so you can see clearly what a wonderful soul you are!

Before we do that, there are a few things you need to know.

Number one, it’s NOT your fault. 

It’s not your fault that your parents are constantly stressed out.
It’s not your fault that your dad hits you.
It’s not your fault your dad leaves you for months and you don’t know if he will come back.
It’s not your fault your dad stops speaking to you for weeks when you need him the most.
It’s not your fault your mom is too busy to be there for you.
It’s not your fault your dad criticizes you and yells at you when you really need his support.
It’s not your fault your dad is an alcoholic. 
It’s not your fault your parents hate each other and use you and your sister as shields.
It’s not your fault your parents are poor and unfortunate things happen to them.
It’s not your fault your sister is depressed.
It’s not your fault that your family is broken.

None of this is YOUR FAULT.

Number two, You are not a burden, to anyone!!

It’s okay to ask for lunch money without feeling bad. 
It’s okay to ask for a ride without feeling bad.
It’s okay to want a present without feeling bad.
It’s okay to call your mom when you fall off your bike or get a bee sting without feeling bad.
It’s okay to want to spend time with your mom without feeling bad.
It’s okay to bring up tough topics about your life without feeling bad.
It’s okay to talk to her without feeling like you’re disrupting important work.

You don’t add stress to anyone’s life.
You are not difficult to deal with.
In fact, you are amazing to be around and you inspire people. 
People want you to be around them!!!
Your needs and wants are good!

You are NOT a burden.


Number three, I am really sorry.

I’m sorry when the adults in your life failed to notice as you wailed in pain for hours.
I’m sorry when they failed to notice you drowning your feelings with alcohol and numbing your pain with drugs and cigarettes.
I’m sorry when they accepted that you were “just crazy” and ignored all of your cries for help, waiting for you to leave home.
I’m sorry when you had no one to talk to.
I’m sorry when you ate and ate and ate because eating gave you comfort... until you gained so much weight that you started vomiting and starving yourself. 
I’m sorry when you had to figure out how to do everything ALONE because you felt like it would be a burden if you asked for any help.
I’m sorry you were disconnected from your parents.
I’m sorry you had to figure out how to live life all alone. It must be such a struggle.
I’m sorry your mom never explained what to expect when your body changes.
I’m sorry your parents never talked about how to be in a healthy relationship. 
I’m sorry your first boyfriend cheated on you with your best friend and you weeped silently in your bed all alone because there was no one to talk to.
I’m sorry you felt like a sore loser at school and then came home to feel like a sore loser at home.
I’m sorry you felt insecure at home and at school and everywhere you walked on this planet.
I’m sorry you felt like you didn’t belong anywhere.

I know you feel very small and scared and unsure, but it’s okay. It’s okay because I’m here for you now. Yes, I’m going to guide you all through your life. 

I want you to know, I love you! I love you! I love you!!!!!!

I’ll be right here to support you and show you how wonderful you are. I will make happy memories with you. I will walk beside you. I’m on this path with you.

If you’re feeling down right now, it’s going to pass, hang in there my dear!!! We can work on this together. I know it sucks, but you’re going to feel crappy for a bit. It stinks, but you’re going to feel this, and it is OKAY. You have the right to feel this way and it’s not your fault. We are human. Good and bad things happen all the time. Don’t beat yourself up for it. Be good to yourself. Nurture yourself. Like everything else, it will eventually fade. And then you’ve faced it!! And it wasn’t THAT bad and it didn’t last THAT long.

You. Are. amazing. I believe in you. I love you. I am here for you.",08Mar2018,1
48,"My wife and I have dealt with depression with varying degrees of success for roughly 15 years now.

Does anyone have any advice? Thanks in advance. (Sorry for bad writing. Im just jumbled)",08Mar2018,3
52,"I have an adorable awesome 1yr old baby who loves to cuddle and I love cuddling him too. I’ve never been a touchy feely person, but it’s different with my own tiny person. That being said, sometimes with no warning... touch will feel unbearable. Like I’d rather die than feel the sensation of being touched. It’s happening right now so I’m sitting on the stairs watching him through a baby gate to avoid being touched. Even my cat rubbing up against me can set me off. I’m on 3 meds (Effexor, Seroquel, and Propranolol). My doctor referred me to my first appointment with a psychiatrist to get a better diagnosis and to better determine medicines/doses but the appointment isn’t for a month and a half. It’s so confusing how I can be totally fine with touching for days at a time and suddenly out of nowhere I feel absolute disgust and rage.  Any ideas on ways to cope or try to calm myself would be great. Also, I know this isn’t the place to seek a diagnosis, but any ideas on what this is or what causes it? My current diagnosis is depression and anxiety. I’ve been on my meds for 8-9 months but the issues with touch just don’t stop.",08Mar2018,2
53,"I am lying on my bed staring at the white wall thinking about what it would like if I cut my throat and sprayed my blood all over the it.  Or even just stab myself in the throat.  These thoughts are constant.  I think about stabbing myself in the stomach, jumping off bridges and stepping in front of speeding traffic.  Last month I stood on a busy road and contemplated stepping in front of the bus.  But I decided it was going too slow and wouldn't do what I needed it to do.  Today I was close to stepping in front of a motor cycle.  I wondered what it would do to me.  For as long as I can remember I've had these thoughts.  If I hear on the news someone's been killed I feel jealous it wasn't me.  I know I must be crazy.  Just need the guts to do what I'm always fantasizing.   ",08Mar2018,8

59,"Long post sorry in advance I hope I’m doing this right. Last year I had a family member die and I fell pretty hard into situational depression, my dog died that summer and I was just getting worse and worse. I started to push a lot of people away and I focused on my studies because I wanted to do well and I just needed something to do. If I wasn’t sleeping, I was studying in the library or eating or in class. I’ve struggled with time management a lot and paying attention has been a struggle with ADD but with meds it’s manageable. Anyways, last semester I nailed it. I did better than I ever have before. I was organized and got work in on time and got mostly A’s. I’m usually an A &amp; B student but this was different, I felt like I finally had school figured out. Like after years of struggling at this middle ground of “not bad” I finally could express my love for learning and show others what I can really do. I was miserable, but I was proud of myself and I had drive. A lot of my sadness turned to anger, fear, and hate; and soon I just receded inwards socially and emotionally. I barely felt anything anymore other than those three things and it was like a fuel I was using and it was working. It scared me because I like being happy I like having fun but I was doing well so i didn’t care. This semester I got back and had a panic attack in bed. But I decided I was sick of being so numb to everything and I wanted to work through it. So I sat up all night and just talked myself through my problems. And surprisingly I felt a lot better. I smiled genuinely for the first time in a year and finally felt like I was on the right track. And now I can’t seem to do anything right. My grades are the worst they’ve ever been. I can’t focus at all and everything just feels so jumbled and confusing . I feel like I can’t relate to anyone and am just not interested in talking to new people. Now more than ever I feel myself receding inwards emotionally and socially. Like I can finally feel again but I’m just so distracted by these feelings I can’t focus on anything else. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot like I’m talking to myself or just imagining conversations with people rather than having them with real people. I feel like I’m going insane and I don’t know what’s happening. I feel like everything I’m doing is wrong and all my drive is gone now. If anyone can make any heads or tails of what’s going on I’d appreciate it.",08Mar2018,1
60,"I was diagnosed with Suicide-OCD, but this feeling is scaring me. 

So basically the feeling is like, random pictures of me living a normal life, but the pictures look dark and weird, stuck in the back in my head. And like a 'flat line' future feeling. With a knot in the stomach and tiredness.

For example:

Me working with a dark cloud etc. and then commiting suicide.

Me living a normal life(my usual life before this.) And like an anxious overwhelmed feeling. With the s thing again.

Me breaking down etc.

Like 'there is no point feeling'.

Flat life feeling. Can't really describe it.

Like if i work i will s. Etc i don't want to.

Anger feeling. Etc.

My syptoms are:
Knot in the stomach
Bad mood(not constantly.)
Nervousness.
Feeling on the edge.(not constantly.)

I don't feel worthless.
I don't feel sad.
I don't feel guilty.
I don't feel my parents wilo be better without me.

61,"I’ve had problems with depression since I was around 14, with things getting so bad only three times that I’ve actually sought help for it. My first time put me off greatly as I was referred to a children’s psychologist because I was under 17 and then as soon as I turned 17 they discharged me even though on the same day I told the psychiatrist I wanted to die, so I lost all faith in getting help.

Since 2014 I occasionally hear voices that say incredibly hurtful things to me. It’s hard to explain because it changes but sometimes they’re already in my head but other times it’s like there’s a man standing next to me saying it. I hear them most when I feel really down.

I gave birth in 2016 and had been completely fine until around November last year, and things are kind of coming to a head. I’m on 30mg is citalopram but I really don’t think it does anything. I’m scared that if I divulge this to my doctor tomorrow in case they’re going to think I have a serious problem and take my daughter away.

65,"When I was in my pre-teens I started kind of meditating to music, without knowing what mediation is, focusing as much as I can on the sound and on my feelings. Long story short, after several years of this ""training"" with the same songs I felt such deep happiness when listening to them that all other life has seemed meaningless compared to, ever since. I am now 25 and I miss that bliss, I just feel like pushing play and, I don't know, killing myself to music or something, because I know I'll never feel anything near this in real life. I'm in a happy long-term relationship, have just graduated with flying colours and have what looks like a fulfilling life, and as a disclaimer, I am actually far from suicidal, so no need for wake-up calls. But has anyone encountered something similar or even know what to google? Google results to ""music addition"" or ""dangers of meditation"" have been no help.",08Mar2018,1
67,"This is a list of things that have happened/are happening in my life.


I was a bullied at school and became a bully, primarily due to my own immaturity I think. I cant forgive myself for it. I was always a bit of an odd duck at school. The kids that I made friends with all had issues, by issues I mean being obsessed with Columbine, talking about attacking other students. I remember one kid talking me about how he wanted to sneak up behind another and hit him in the back of the head with a hammer. This wasn't just one specific group, these were different kids over different years some with me as the only connection but I never wanted to hurt anyone so how did I attract them or did they attract me?


After school, I became friends (i wouldn't call them that anymore) with a group of guys who would insult me or tell me to shut up as soon as I said something. I haven't really made a friend since then.


I spent the vast majority of my 20's unemployed moving in no direction whatsoever. I became a social recluse to the point that I would get scared walking past people on the street. eventually, i started smoking weed I smoked pretty much 24/7 to the point that being sober felt like I was I high and being high felt normal.


When I did get a job, I was hated there. People called me a useless cunt. I was told by people I used to work with that I had all the signs of a serial killer, these people weren't professional psychologists just assholes that didn't understand me. Truth is I can't even kill a bug without feeling bad about it.


I began seeing a psychologist who told me I have hyperarousal &amp; hypervigilance (PTSD). I do have flashbacks but a lot of them aren't stressful, I can have a flashback to yesterday breakfast. When I spoke to my psychologist about how I wanted to die, she told me I was just a good person looking for a way out of a hellish life. I want to give my life to save someone else, anyone else. I have fantasized about that since I was 14 and I still do today.
I don't believe that it's because I want to die, it's more about wanting to give that gift, its kind of hard to explain.


Now I'm in my late 20's, I'm virtually unemployable no qualifications to my name. My social skills are extremely bad (if anyone has advice on how to fix that it would be greatly appreciated). I still haven't made any friends though I do have a girlfriend somehow (i think my parents are involved in that but no one will say anything when I ask them). I talk to myself way too much for example if I'm having dinner at a restaurant  I will partake in the conversation the people at the next table are having without actually being part of it. This seems to make people think I'm mental which makes me wonder. my short term memory is screwed it a be a challenge to remember what I did last week. My long-term memory I need to sort of force it if I want to remember something from my past. My mind feels like its extremely slow. I also have a recurring nightmare but I don't run away from the monster in it, i tell others to run away as I run towards to it.

I'm not sure where I belong 

What the hell do I do now?

68,"I have no idea who I am anymore, I don’t enjoy life as I used to, I don’t feel suicidal but I also never felt so peaceful and accepting of death as I do now. 

I’ve lost all understanding of myself and who I am, I’m always forgetting stuff like leaving the iron on after ironing or leaving the light in the bathroom on as I exit, it’s like my brain is hollow and I’m just constantly in my own little world ignoring everything that is happening in reality.

69,"Not sure exactly where to ask this, concerned about my SO's well-being, and want to be better informed. She has a history of depression and anxiety, and recently went through a pretty heavy traumatic event. She has anxiety and fears that involve her going to hell, and the floor opening up and her falling through. She gets extreme anxiety and paranoia after watching a trailer for a horror movie/reading about something even a little bit scary. 

She's on meds for depression/anxiety. Not exactly sure what.

What does this mean for her mental state? In my eyes, it's not something that can be written off as normal/functioning behavior. It gets in the way of her daily life and leads to her having what seems like a sense of impending doom throughout the day. Aside from reassurance/doing things to get her mind off her fears, what can be done?",08Mar2018,1
71,"So, my friend Leah today was telling me all about this issue she has mentally. For some perspective, she’s an 18 year old female, she just started seeing a therapist and was prescribed something for anxiety, which she claims calms her down a bit. (I’m not a fan of prescription drugs for mental issues but that’s a whole different discussion) Anyways, she was telling me that when she’s talking to people, sometimes people will say certain things that if she doesn’t quite understand what it meant, or takes it the wrong way, it is IMPOSSIBLE to let that thought go. She said she feels the need to bring it up or it eats her alive, and cannot pay attention to anything else that’s being said because the thought is just right there screaming. Even the smallest thing that people would normally just shrug off, or not even care about. 

She told me she never used to be like this, and that she’s becoming almost OCD about things that she hadn’t been before, she said it’s not that she’s suicidal, but she does not want to live this way anymore, and she doesn’t know how to make all these thoughts stop. 

I just wanted to know if anybody has ever felt the same way or similar and what they do to deal with it or overcome it. Any possible natural things she could do, I just wanted to be able to help her out a bit.

74,"Okay. This is the first 'Confession' post I've ever made on any social media. After you have read this post, I understand if you are disgusted. Just please don't hate on me in the comments. So, I will never be happy. And that's because I do some pretty bad stuff. So, to clear this up, I am a pansexual male. So, let's start with how I found out I wasn't straight. Um so I am, let's say, not of age, and  I used to stuff with.... Dildos. I know, its pretty disgusting. Now you might be thinking, doing things with dildos when you are male does not mean you aren't gay, but I have been attracted to opposite genders, non gender etc. On to the next thing. I am going to disown my sister. She has put me and my family through so much, and I hate her, but I feel like its wrong to get her out of my life. Next point, I keep pushing the fact that I have a crush on my best friend down on her. She is amazing, beautiful, smart, funny, and kind, but itsblike I'm forcing her to ask me out. One day she'll snap and stop talking to me. Finally, my mum is so ill and depressed that she frequently talks about suicide. She is only 35! I don't want her to do it, but I know she will, and I won't be able to stop it.

So. That's it. There is more, but I've had enough for today. I might make a post tomorrow.

75,"I'm a 14 year old boy who's suffering of several mental health issues but who's parents refuse to accept that i'm ill.
 I've never been the one who've talked to their parents about their issues and i could never figure out why, i simply don't trust them and i am unable to even answer a simple yes or no questiong from them in fear of them not approving my answer. I lie a lot to avoid difficult situations or bad reactions. Althoug they look like a great family on paper and for my whole life i thought they were but have realised that they aren't that great. My father is mentally unstable and has countless health issues, he's also on the verge of alcoholic (somtimes gets blackout drunk on weekdays and every weekend). My mother is just of the strict sort who refuses to change her mind. They seperated about 5 years ago and since then she's found a partner who i absolutely despise and is continuously mentally abusing both my mom, my sisters and i. (Keep in mind that they've never physically hurt me) 

About 3 years ago i first started talking to the school counselor because i was wondering why i was feeling so strange this continued for a year and then left her for good after the summer break. I started going to a youth(mental health)center center who later sent me to the emergency mental heath clinic when i told them about my severe suicidal thoughts. At this point they were obliged to tell my parents about what was going on they first seemed like they genuinely cared.
 I have more recently started talking to a psychologist who i've told i want to get a diagnosis  but when my parents found out they weren't too happy. My mother now refuses to belive that i'm not feeling well and my father thinks this is a part of a trend. 
Both of them doesn't belive in mental illnesd and refuse to see the risk of me not continuing getting help. They always talk after the sessions about how it is unnecessary and how they think that everything i say i feel is made up because i seem so happy all the time (i am showing severe signs of adhd).
They are continuing to encourage me to stop going to the appointments and force me to deny meds of any sort but i know this will just make it worse.

Please help me get my parents understand that this isn't some stupid trends or just a game. I've ran out of hope and have no idea on how i should continue from here.",08Mar2018,4
77,"So about a month ago I bought a dab pen (weed vape that uses THC oil) and the first time I used it I got WAY too high and nearly had a panic attack. Since then, since I'm an idiot, I smoked it nearly everyday for a week or two, and then from that point on went on normally smoking real weed about twice a week or so sometimes more. Since that first bad experience and on I kept on feeling more and more foggy in daily life. Up until recently the symptoms i had seemed to line up with ""depersonalization disorder"". After this past sunday where I had a long night of drinking and smoking with friends, the next and days since then everything has felt like a dream in a sense and I've been very foggy, and feel like I'm living life in autopilot almost. It's hard to describe, but things don't feel normal. Should I be worried? see a doctor? I haven't smoked in 4 days now and things seem a little better at times but even worse at others.

My first day there I didn’t talk to anyone but i remember when I first walked in I saw this cute blonde guy with beautiful blue eyes. I knew I wanted to get to know him but not until I was completely sober. The next day I finally left my room and sat on the couch and was watching TV and he came and sat next to me and we hit it off so fast and we had so many things in common but the one that really hit me was that we were at the same school in 8th grade and had no idea. coincidence or fate? From that point on we talked everyday for hours and always sat with each other during meals, group therapy and outside time. We had this crazy chemistry and connection it just felt so right. One day he smoothly gave me his number and I kept it in a little cup next to my bed. The 5th day I was there I found out I was getting discharged and I told him. I could tell he was sad. We were playing a board game and the nurse came in and said my parents were there ready to pick me up. As soon as I walked out he came after me and asked “Hey do you still have my number” and i replied “yes ill text you” and he said “okay bye”.  Now 7 months later still dating im completely head over heels in love. He is my best friend and soulmate. We have made so many plans for the future. I truly believe he is my perfect person.
