0,"I’ve recently come to the conclusion that I’m textbook codependent. I’m a people pleaser, care giver, never state my boundaries, low self esteem, mentally unstable, and loads of problems with communication and intimacy. What do I do to fix this? ",23Jan2018,15
1,"Hi all. 

I'm hoping I can get some advice from someone who has maybe experienced a similar situation as either myself or my bro (24) in this situation.

My brother graduated highschool as a great athlete with a good group of friends. Slowly over the past 2 years he's isolated himself from all of his friends, he has just recently quit his job, and now has anxiety just from leaving the house. If I talk to him too much to see how he's doing he gets defensive and doesn't want to communicate. I think he feels ashamed for where he's at right now in his life and maybe doesn't want me to pity him or something. 

I live a couple hours away from him and try to text him casually about sports or other inconsiquential things that we would normally text about years ago. If I ever bring up how he's doing or how a job hunt may be going he doesn't respond. I really want to help him with where he's at but don't want to get shut out of his life by pushing him. He doesn't have any other outlets outside of myself and our parents. I have tried to invite him out to play community sports or hang out with me and my friend group but he declines or doesn't respond back. Idk what to do to help him without pushing him away. 

I guess my question is: What would you want from your brother if you were experiencing what my brother is experiencing? I don't want to piss him off by pestering him about his feelings (as he is very proud and doesn't want to bring it up most times) but I also don't want to have him feel like he's alone. Any advice is appreciated on where to go from here. 

Thank you.",23Jan2018,27
2,"I'm not sure if I should post this here or not, but it has to do with being lonely and having no one to talk to, so I assumed it fits. I accidentally stumbled on this website recently that made me cry so hard. It's prisoners who have on one writing to them, and they have their own profiles and everything basically begging people to write to them. I want to write to all of them, but they're looking for pen-pals and such. It made me so sad thinking of these people stuck in the grind of prison for who knows how long, and the only friends they have are probably just there so they can stay safe.

3,"Hi Folks,

A little bit of exposition is in order so please bear with me.  My father has a tendency to stumble upon new things which then become the new ""gospel"" for him and he begins aggressively pestering me about this particular thing and completely dismisses any skeptical claims of mine as ""not being open minded.""  His most recent ""kick"" is the Ketogenic diet spearheaded by Dr. Mark Hyman.  Now I've already read some very critical reviews of his book, notably by 60-year nutritional research biochemist T. Colin Campbell.  However, when I recently asked him a for a bit of financial help for therapy with a psychologist for my OCD, he lost his mind saying ""you don't have a brain problem, you have a gut problem!""

Now, I will both concede that my diet could use some improvement and diet does have an effect on mental well being, however I take issue with the idea that therapy is ""throwing away money"" and that my father, who has no background in medicine or nutritional science has found the ""off button"" for my intrusive thoughts.  To add to this conundrum, my fiancée is a clinical dietitian with a masters in nutrition who has researched a lot of his claims ""i.e. that gluten (I only eat whole wheat bread) or some other hot topic thing is the root cause of my OCD,"" and has said that there is no evidence to support it.  He of course does not trust this, because he distrusts the entirety of medical science based on the fact that it is ""too compartmentalized"" and ""when you have a sore throat you see a ENT and they just focus on one area of the body.""

What I am asking is what, if any, evidence is there that specific food products have a causal relationship with OCD.  I highly doubt any of this points to cutting out sugar being the tightening of the faucet that will solve all my problems for me.",23Jan2018,1

Anyways, I am afraid of what any therapist would do with that information. I am not going to tell my wife for a load of reasons and I am not going to divorce her. However, I want to make sure my information is safe with the therapist. What would be the best way to navigate this? ",23Jan2018,1

9,"I can't deal with isolation, though that seems to be all I'm good at. I'm in a city I didn't want to be in, with someone I don't want to be with, and I know nobody else around me. My therapist only sees me 1x a week, and as I am unemployed and barely able to take care of myself (food, clothes, hygiene, etc). My brother lives an hour away and never has time to talk with me, my roommate has turned out to be not a great person who stresses me out when she's stressed, I'm unmedicated, I can't tell if I'm splitting on this girl I like or if I'm valid in thinking she doesn't feel the same, I feel like an invalid who needs to be taken care of or something and I hate it",23Jan2018,6
10,"Hello, I've been having some mental issues for some time and I'm looking for a non-confrontational and somewhat anonymous method in which to share some some of my thoughts and perhaps get some feedback.

First off, a little background. I'm 35 and an Army Veteran raised in Texas and later Louisiana. I'm currently in a long-term relationship and I have 3 year old twins. I also have 2 dogs and a bird. I've been in logistics for several years and I'm currently finishing up school to get in a truck. The money is much better and I know the business. As an overview this should be good, if anyone would like any more detail please let me know. 

So, now for some of things I'm dealing with. First off, over the last few years I have completely isolated myself from everyone I have ever known. I no longer speak to anyone and I quite literally have zero friends. As of today it has probably been close to a year since I have left my house for anything other than work. I can't describe it as anything other than severe anxiety at the thought of going outside. To the point where I can spend days at a time not stepping outside. I used to be an avid outdoors kind of guy. I use to hunt and ride motorcycles and kayak. I have since sold all of it for one reason or another. It's crazy, at times I will feel trapped and think to go do something and I will literally get sweaty and nauseous, my stomach will go nuts, and I'll be stuck in the bathroom for hours. This effects me for everything; family gatherings, birthdays, movies, etc.

I'm also having fucking crazy reactions to my spouse. I can't sleep in the same bed, I feel like I disgust her. I don't know how else to put it. I love her and i think she is the most beautiful woman however when she touches me I flinch. I'll go days not being able to sleep only to feel like I have to go sleep in another room. Sometimes I'll just sleep on bare carpet with just a pillow. 

I sleep so little that I don't have to worry about bothering the kids or her. I'm always awake after they go to sleep and awake when they wake up. It's maddeningly frustrating and it's having a complicated effect on every aspect of my life. I feel, I don't know, anxious and nervous literally every second of every day. I feel manic almost, like I have to constantly be doing something, be it reading or whatever. And if I'm not doing something and I fail to keep myself occupied my nerves go crazy. I get twitchy and paranoid to the point of looking out blinds and shit. 

I feel like I'm losing my sanity, and I mean this absolutely literally. As if I'm losing touch with reality and can't wake up. Also, recently my memory has started to become unreliable. I seem to forget everything. Keys, my wallet, the dog's leash, food I was eating. It's scary.

This is severely effecting me as well as my spouse and children. She is becoming increasingly frustrated with me, especially as I'm having difficulty expressing why I'm feeling this way. This effect seems to be universal. I find every excuse imaginable to not leave the house and I have recently lost jobs because of it and for whatever reason I simply can't talk about it to anyone face to face. I don't know if I'm ashamed or embarrassed or what, I just can't do it, to the point of becoming embarrassingly sick.

I don't know why I'm posting to Reddit honestly. I just feel that if I don't try to do something I'm just going to burn up inside. That's the best description I have to offer. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I would appreciate any insight or help anyone would be willing to offer. 

Thanks

14,"My brother (20) is out of control.  He consistently has panic attacks where he is stressed beyond controllable.  He goes into a crazed mode, yelling (mostly shrieking), dry crying, complaining about how he ""can't take it"", then returning to yelling with some throwing things in between, slamming doors and other generally destructive behaviours. 

Right now I think he's finally lost it with this one.  Usually he stops after a few minutes (10-30), whether by himself or my mother taking him for a drive, but he's been going for about two hours now and it doesn't look like it's stopping any time soon.

I know eventually it will end, but I know eventually there will be the next one.  Me, and my mother can't handle it and I'm sure ,my little sister (13) is scared of it.  He needs to go see someone and no matter by how many people and how many times he is told that he always says that he's fine, that he doesn't need to.

What can I possibly do to get him to realize that he does need help?  I'm from Canada (or Quebec), is there any way we can force him into a psych ward?

Edit: After 4 hours he finally calmed down.  Tomorrow I try to convince him to check into the hospital.",23Jan2018,1
15,"I'm just lost.

The therapist I made an appointment with told me that I'm not going to be good as a long term client because of some of the complications of my grief (past traumas, kinkiness of the relationship with my late husband). I spent... many many hours just trying to find this therapist. I don't have the energy to go through that again. I was running on the adrenaline that came from my husband dying. 

The memorial was on Sunday. His family refused to come. Friends have started to stop checking in. I had been hoping to get support because this is now an all encompassing pain fog.

My EAP through my job even tried to find support groups, when it became clear that I wasn't going to be able to find a therapist. They called today to say that there aren't any non-religious grief groups. (I can't exactly go to a grief group run by a pastor of a religion that condemns gay people. I will clarify: I only said no to religions that explicitly condemn gay people. They're all run by religions that condemn gay people.)

I am... very worried about my growing apathy and numbness. I am doing things like failing at regular self care (like... I forget to eat, for days at a time) and managing my own health (like... ignoring major warning signs that I'm headed for some health problems) . I do not have the energy or not-apathy to get on my feet and find a therapist, again. 

I'm sort of like, ""Well if the worst case scenario is that I die, that just reunites me with my husband that much faster. That's not really a worst case."" which is a) typical of grief but also b) very concerning on an intellectual level.

I'm very lost, ungrounded, and apparently without any kind of professional support. I don't know that there is anything I can do except slowly waste but... I don't like this, I guess.",23Jan2018,2

However, sometimes I get this super strong wave of energy accompanied by paranoia. I start shaking and can't sit still (my legs bouncing will shake the whole room), I start slipping away from the moment and random thoughts will bombard me. It's weird thoughts, like demons are coming to get me or the walls are going to shift into monsters to grab me. My imagination goes NUTS and freaks me out to the point I break out in a sweat and seek out the nearest cold tiled floor to lay on. I don't always remember the whole thing... I've had episodes like that a few times, and the most recent was witnessed by my friends sister. She said I was rambling about visions and shivering like I was freezing to death, but all I remember is sitting on a bathroom floor and stimming by tracing shapes on her hands.

21,"So we shouldn't seek approval from those around us to be happy? But aren't human beings social animals? I mean, isn't romantic love, romantic attraction the ultimate example of this? We want approval don't we? Maybe we shouldn't even think of problems as psychological but instead neuropsychological. I honestly believe there are ""connection"" or ""care taking"" circuits that we all have, and that possibly it's related to dopamine levels, as is romantic love... Maybe co-dependency is when these care taking circuits are over stimulated...My mom for example is still obsessed with me, she still grooms me (my hair) I'm in my 30s... she was still balling up food and curry and shoving it in my mouth when I was around 13 years old (some south asian mothers are like this apparently) .. I remember pulling my head away cause I didn't want any more and she'd force it down me....

Anyway, I digress... I think love is innate but I think it's perfectly natural to feel connected to others and to seek their approval as well, it's kind of like a feedback, a mirror. It's why we have politics. It's why we have ethics. It's why he have protests and fight for each other and ourselves in the greater scheme of things. It's not all about you.

Sometimes I feel this strongly enough that it seems easier if I just laid down to die.

Took too long to finish my degree, the start of me slowing down. The program I was in was abnormally cramped and stressful even for an engineering degree. Started to get panic attacks and arrhythmia towards the end of it. Begain having trouble focusing without assistance (eg caffeine, sugar, a night of drinking, etc). Squeezed by as a mediocre student, drank away a whole year, finally getting my career off the ground, first real voyeur in my field came apart due to someone else outside my control. Waking up one day to realize my entire early 20's I'd wasted since I never matured as a person, probably from intentionally living under a rock and avoiding leaving my comfort zone. Now I'm 25, naive as shit and floundering, all my peers and family look down on me, the baggage with my current social group isn't great due to the drinking phase, and the thought of how many things were more easily solved or prevented five years ago just piles on despair.

For the past 8 years, I've been his yes-man. This man is incapable of intimacy. You know, I've actually tried talking to him about my feelings about things, about my ideas and he acts like a 15 year old or worse. He's a moron.  He just doesn't have a clue.  And yet I'm stuck with him. I don't know how to let him go. I don't think I can or have a choice.  I don't know why I ended up being his friend but I hate him. I really do. I hate them all and I don't think I'll ever connect with a guy again cause now I feel disconnected and I have some sort of resentment towards them all.

See..the problem is, if I ignore his calls, and I tried for a bit.. he'll worry and the get the other guys to call. How do you break ties with someone you've known for so long? He's been nice to me, but I'm really done with compromising. I don't like him.  I think I'd be happier if I wasn't talking to him or even the other guys.  I couldn't even stay at the bar cause I hated the performer, even though a while back I liked him (I'd heard him before)...really messed up now..maybe this is temporary...maybe I'll feel okay later...

I’m not a sociopath or anything, but to my knowledge it’s suppose to be normal when others are sad it makes you sad or it should effect how you feel. But no matter the case, I find that other people’s moods or emotions can almost never effect how I feel. If that makes any sense.

For example, my girlfriend had a puppy she got for her birthday, she had it for 2 years before she had to watch it he put down. She cried for months. I found that it never put me down or made me feel any real sadness. In fact I felt that every time I comforted her or reassured her, I was being fake. But it’s not just with my girlfriend it’s with everyone. But I know I’m not a sociopath. I do feel emotions and I do care about people

Derealization/Depersonalization (look it up I'm not going to explain it) Due to drug use.

I'm from the UK. On the 29th December I cut one of my wrists (very deeply) with a simple kitchen knife. The wound required ten stitches.

Because I was drunk, taken a strong LSD tablet and also a benzo (to try and bring down the trip) My terrified girlfriend decided it was best for me to go to rehab and I was willing to do anything that she wanted because I felt so ashamed about what I'd done.

I spent one week in a London rehab and as it got nearer my discharge date I became panicked and not ready to face the outside world so I sought the help of a second consultant who booked me in to a second London rehab for a period of 28 days. I am out now because I a discharged myself against medical advice because the place in my opinion was appalling.

Now having read that, what I want to ask is peoples opinion on why a happy, health man in his late thirties might spiral out of control in such a devastating way and nearly end up dead?

I do have an extremely low self esteem and what I've since learned to be ""imposter syndrome"" I would also say that GAD can be thrown in the mix with those.

Because I discharged myself I now have really nowhere I feel i can go other than NA meetings etc I'm just looking for some friendly advice.

Please note, although I was wasted. It wasn't a bad trip and I have much experience with LSD in the past and abstained for almost 1.5yrs before this Xmas blowout.

Ever since I can remember I have had an irrational hatred for a certain kind of animal, like I’m not talking about a mild dislike, a seething unexplainable hatred.

I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I've ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I'm SO, SO insecure about it. I'm feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who's talking a lot by nature. I've always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I'm much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously... After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before)    

I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I've found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that's what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I don't like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise.     

My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we don't have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I don't have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less ""special"" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment.     

And because I don't have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I don't have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I'm leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I don't have any other reasons to leave the house... The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside.     

Anyways, I don't expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices... I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you :) And I hope things will improve for me. I've always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period.     

Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyone",23Jan2018,4

I have no desire to ""win"" women in a fight of love or whatever that is.  I guess all my life I've been sort of suppressed, and maybe I have a low self-esteem...

49,"i am in my 30's from norway and had slow increasing depression for years. i have a physiatrist and are drug free.  
im not sure where to start, because i dont know where it began.
but i do have clear past trauma but dont know if its just the straw that broke the camel's back or something else.
the problem with my trauma is that its years since it happened and its was something done towards me, and it seems like its normal behaviour in society, not always accepted as good but human flaw. the details may not be important but how i go about living with it and the human world as me.  
is it just up to me to change values and let people get away with this? because intelligent thinking and a loving heart wont fit in this society and maybe it is my choice to let it affect me this way because if i just dont have any reaction to it, they get away with it. many people kill in the moment and that is considered normal, but its been years since for me and i choose to react with love so that moment has passed for me. 
is it justice i feel? because what happened to me is very windescread and maybe thats why its so accepted and it feels like i have to get over it to fit in, but if i just fit in i wont make a difference or a change in the world. and we need a better world.

51,"Hello all.

As the title says, the passage of time is starting to cause me anxiety. At points over the last couple of months I have been telling myself things like ""You're here right now, but in two weeks you'll be thinking of this moment and it will be as if no time had passed at all"". Of course, two weeks pass and the reality is that time has passed and the ruthlessness of it (one point to the next with seemingly nothing in between and no control over it) is starting to worry me. I feel one day that I'll flash to 20 years in the future and be thinking of this exact moment, feeling like it was instant too.

Anyone ever felt anything like this?",23Jan2018,19
52,"Hi so I'm a 16 F. I'm currently going through exams etc and my final Cambridge exams are approaching soon. I have a lot going on here but il try to stay as calm as possible writing this, without curse words. So to start off with my parents are very uncooperative and two sighted aka they sometimes act nice and try to be nice parents but for most of the part they are uncooperative af, they never understood me in any way. ESPECIALLY if it's the case with studying....so here are the problems I'm gonna enlist in points to make this easier.

1) Im in the last year of my O level studies and I'll be done once my Cambridge exams approach. O levels is a three year studying course and I'm in the last year and have done all the syllabus in school and pretty much know everything. However my mid exams had approached and I didn't do well in them. EVERYONE didn't do well because a study of fucking three years can't be revised in a month (yeah we had a month for revision) even the teachers said that we should only pass these exams cuz the main one's are the Cambridge ones ANYHOW I did! Look I always used to score bad and frequently fail in sciences but I passed! And only failed in chemistry with a loss of a single number!! Like...ok so hoping that my parents would understand just like other's parents did and encouraged them ,(btw I was in the minority of the students in school who passed so many subjects). My parents discouraged me and told me I was worthless and I didn't had the 'potential' to do it. If they have studied from a lower education system that isn't as tough as mine! And they KNOW mine isn't easy at all!! Still they kept discouraging me and my mom kept mentally harassing me which bring me to the next problem....

2) my mom isn't really a mom. She's more of a thot. Side note she flirts with guys on social media and talks with them on the phone and probably has cheated on dad. Well she kept screaming at me that I couldn't do it and she kept barking at me. She called me different names I don't wanna mention. (I sat day and night preparing for my exams without a break) and still she was like , you are hopeless u can not do it. ANOTHER SIDE NOTE! I KNOW I CAN DO IT AND ITS EASY FOR ME IF I HAVE ATLEAST THREE MONTHS TO REVISE THE THREE YEAR SHIT. anyways pretty much my WHOLE life this bitch has been  annoying me, she usually would open the door when I was studying in my exam time and would just simply annoy me. She gets physical some of the times and SCREAMS like a fucking cunt all the time. She unreasonably spies on me and oh god...she even makes fun of me with my younger brother, backbites and annoys me in general. There are pretty more intense things but they'll make this reddit too long so... moving on to the next and and last....

3) my parents decided to set me up a tutor as i talked to dad That I needed tuition in math and chemistry ONLY. But guess what they did they set up a tutor for fucking all science subjects and math (the tutor is shitty and doesn't know math that good ,...THE SUBJECT THAT I NEED THE MOST HELP IN). ANYHOW I'm a student and I study like 8 hours a day..with my mother mentally harassing me , inclusive. however the tutor has fucked up my routine and BIOLOGY... my strongest subject! I don't even NEED tuition in that, he is emphasising on it! Like wtf! And when I try to talk to my uncooperative parents they tell me to shut up or I'll get beaten up. They never help me with anything and never listened to any of my needs. Im deprived of care, I don't even need them now I just wish they die. Anyways I'm happy that there's someone to teach me sciences now and I could get more better but it was all about time, of I had three months of preparation i could get A stars. BUT ofc my parents don't seem to understand that and they abuse me instead. I can't even study properly on my own on my time now. I had a peaceful routine and ample time to study and I had goals and aims but they seem shattered by the disruption of my routine.... 

I've been abused and harassed mentally my whole life with a dozens of problems, it's just enough, I've tried suicide attempts but I always fail somehow. Ive been a victim of drugs and self harm. This all is just another tiny piece of my depressing fall downs in life...I just can take all this anxiety and depression.... 

Any suggestions? Maybe ?",23Jan2018,7
53,"Why is it when someone says 'no' or I'm rejected there's a tiny part of me that says... I'm entitled to this and I'm going to keep pressing this person.  Why don't I like complying? Why is it that when I'm asked to do something good, as opposed to me doing it myself of my own will, I feel resentment?  Even if it's something nice, a good thing to do and the other person likes it, I feel like it's not genuine and I don't like it, and I feel ""less"" somehow.  Was I just spoiled as a child that didn't learn how to listen?  I don't know where this is coming from, but I think it's why I hate my sister.  She always used to tell me do things, would tell my mom I'm selfish, and I hated her and I always thought I wasn't selfish and was actually a good person...

I mentioned earlier that I had an issue with showing love.  I replied to a comment on here and apologized for my previous comment, and then they replied ""now that's a good response"".  Even though I did a nice thing, I felt ""less"". I didn't want to be nice, and I know they gave me positive feedback and I did the right thing, but I felt gross inside.

55,"Hey there, I'm a 20y old who suffers depressive episodes, heavy daily anxiety and self-doubt. These are all caused due to growing up in a homophobic country with an abusive alcoholic mother. Any kind of therapist or professional mental health help is outside of my budget right now and will be for a while, so I've finally reached the point of asking strangers online for help and it's making me feel pathetic.

I recently moved away from my country to the UK and my life has finally begun to VERY slowly take a positive turn and for a while I regained some control over my mental health. This all crashed and burned gloriously 3 days ago when one of my biggest fears - not being able to let go of a thought, came to life. 

My anxiety likes to do this thing where during particularly bad episodes it will make me ""check"" myself to see if I'm anxious or feeling better, which will ironically trigger self-doubt and more anxiety. Well 3 days ago out of curiosity I checked an old acquaintance's facebook and saw a homophobic post relating to my country, which admittedly upset me but not particularly much. However, my mind has not been able to stop checking whether it's still thinking about that person, without any emotions attached to him or the prior event, it just mechanically pops into my mind every 2-3-15-30min etc. and I have never had anything like this happen.

It feels like I'm finally going nuts and depression has begun settling in again. If anyone has any advice or input to just reassure me I'm not insane it would be GREATLY appreciated. ",23Jan2018,1
57,"I am 24 years old (female) dx with schizoaffective, bpd and confirmed mild OCD symptoms (though he says the latter exists, he doesn't include it in paperwork). (I obsessively check things) As well as several traumas (though no official ptsd diagnosis)

I get intrusive thoughts multiple times a day. They are either of me hurting people (though not brutally anymore) or me being brutally injured by others or unforseen circumstances. This doesn't really reflect a lot of my trauma per se.

I have believed I am clairvoyant for a long time though now it is hard to distinguish which is my predictions about my future or really about to happen. I have theorised that I am seeing other realities. My one friend gets similar thoughts but she is adamant she gets it from her meds as one of our meds is the same (and it is her only one). But for me, these have been prevalent throughout my life. 

As well I sometimes feel there is a figurative demon inside me because I have an inner desire to be mean or violent for no reason--which on occasion I slip (generally just being mean but I fear I willl one day be violent)

I am currently on a unique regimen (as its unusual to receive 2 depots that are different) but none of my medication seems to take them away. I have a hard time taking my SNRI because of memory problems but even when i was taking them steadily they remaimed though the anxiety and pervasive need to check and reassure subsided. Invega trinza, Abilify maintena, loxapine as a prn and effexor.

Sometimes I wonder if these are thoughts other people are having about me when I visualize certain strangers killing me. As I have taken on foreign thoughts in the past.

61,"Spent the whole night inside my own head
It’s just…my x, father of my kid, keeps trying to be my friend

And he hurt me and fucked my opinion of the world so completely 
On top of being overall emotionally/verbally abusive…and on a few occasions raising a hand to me 
I found so many signs and things pointing to infidelity 
But that man would deny and lie
And freak out that I accused him of lying ‘because he didn’t lie he just didn’t tell me certain things’

He made me feel like a crazy person

Any time I think about dating again I have a damn panic attack and the fight or flight response kicks in

…I tanked my next attempt at a relationship with a friend soooo bad
Like honestly I know him and I wouldn’t have worked, but I see my role and how I made it worse
I hurt him
And I drove myself nuts…

I still have such a hard time even thinking about letting someone in…about trusting someone

I feel so fucking broken and I hate it
I want to fix myself..
I’m going to counseling
I’m trying

But I still find myself on days like today where I feel utterly hopeless
And not a damn thing anyone says will help

“It’s only a block of time”
“It’ll get better”
“You’re not broken”
Same shit over and over

I know…I’m fucking aware
But that doesn’t make it hurt less

I feel like I’ll never be able to find someone and let myself be happy with them

I can’t afford for be hurt again like that, I’m terrified of trusting someone and letting them in…only to have them betray me and devistate me…it’s the what if’s that are killing me

I just want to be able to trust my own judgement…I want to be able to let myself be happy again

I just...I feel like I can’t trust myself
With attempt at dating after my divorce I felt like I couldn’t open up
I felt like I was always second guessing myself...
Like 
...am I being irrational about something due to past experiences...
Or am I not reacting enough?
Am I falling into the same shit I did with ex husband where I sacrificed my own happiness for him until there was nothing left?

And on top of that there is the fear of being cheated on again...

And I just wish...I just wish my x could be a decent person for like a minute and fess up to what he did...
I wish I knew the extent of it 
I wish I had proof that i wasn’t a crazy pants

But I know he isn’t capable of really owning his flaws/failures

And you know...maybe he never actually fucked anyone else...but I know he was on his way

He would flirt with other women and his ex’s 
He’d lie about where he was going
He downloaded the tinder app
He changed all his passwords...he’d shit a brick if I walked near his phone or computer
He’d clear his texts and Facebook messages

I mean...the damn signs are there
You don’t do that shit if you’re not doing something wrong

67,"I'm starting to think that I actually have narcissistic personality disorder, not just narcissism. Why do I say this? Because I went to a strip club (I don't usually go, only gone a few times I was trying to get over anxiety, thought it might be worth a try) 2 weeks ago, one of the strippers came and talked to me for no more than 5 minutes, and then I saw her later on stage and then I was in ""love"".  It was actually more like imprinting.  She was there, she was aesthetically pleasing, gave me some attention, and my brain did the rest.  This has happened to me in the past. I've fallen in ""love"" with women I don't even know and when I think about my past relationships, I wasn't in love with a person.  I don't think it was even love and I may very well be incapable of real love.  

A little more detail on the past loves... my first gf, it was her hands ""clam-hands"" and her eyes..I called her integral for some reason.  That's all I knew of her.  My second gf it was ""pickle hand"" and tumbleweed, cause of her hair. Every time I saw a picture of a tumbleweed, I thought of her but I mean she literally was the tumbleweed.  Also bats too, because she said bat at a random moment once.  I also made the association between her and small furry animals for some reason.  Again, I didn't really know her as a person.  Actually read somewhere that sociopaths tend to see people as animals and I do this. When I was in a psyc ward there was this weird guy walking around with his neck out pacing the halls, and I tried to tease him, but I ""loved"" him...but not as a person, he was just entertaining and interesting, but that's my depraved version of love...I don't think I can experience real love for a person. 

I fall in love with quirks, and mannerisms.  All I have is lust and a romantic high.  That doesn't mean I don't get attached, at least in terms of brain chemistry, it doesn't mean that once the person leaves and my dopamine levels drop that I don't feel like crap, just that it's not a genuine feeling of loss, it's just dysphoria.

This really makes me suspect I might be a narcissist. 

I don't know if I've ever really fallen in love with a person.  Everybody to me is just a caricature or an abstraction, not a 3 dimensional person, but a template.",23Jan2018,1
71,"Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here. 

For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment. 

I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me. 

Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe. 

I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it.

When I was 6-8 I molested one of my younger siblings, I did not touch them inappropriately but I made them touch me inappropriately but not my genitals. I am not sure if this affects me mentally or emotionally. I feel very terrible and guilty due to this.
I've always had trouble in school, my teachers never liked me and would often punish me. I would get terrible grades throughout elementary school, junior high (1.8 gpa), and high school (3.4 gpa). 
I would bully people often as a kid and I didn't have that many friends. During Jr. High I had 3 friends and I was extremely anti-social. 
During High School I started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana. I got moved to a new high school where I spent my sophomore-senior years depressed and sleeping in every class. I would sleep during orchestra, French, physics, English, art, etc. 
I became addicted to this gaming when I was 6-8 years old, I have been playing the same game for over 14 years off and on.
Before my second semester at University I became addicted to gaming again and became extremely depressed so I withdrew and dropped out of University. I would play non-stop 14-16 hours a day without sleep and I would often go days without sleep. 
When I came home from University I became depressed for 2 years. 
I had no friends only myself and my online friends from the gaming community. 
The gaming community that I was a part of was extremely toxic and cruel. Cyber bullying, scamming, and internet dating was extremely common. I have done all of these things because I was introduced to them by the online community. 
I began selling my nude pictures/pictures online to perverts for in-game perks. My parents found out I was doing this and the police were called and became involved because I was being harassed by people online for my idiotic and stupid behavior. 
I have attempted to kill myself once after the police incident which I believe I did in order to gain attention from friends and family. I am not 100% sure. I may have done it as a cry for help or in order to end my miserable life.
I began seeing a therapist and began taking medication. I was also admitted into a mental hospital on a 72 hour hold.
When I was a teenager I became obsessed with the idea of joining the Army in order to become an Army Ranger, I was off and on again obsessed with the idea for several years and have recently given up on the idea of ever becoming a Ranger because it is impossible now and completely unrealistic. 
I recently reconnected with a friend that is attending University in another state. 
I left my house and began living with their family for several months. I began smoking marijuana multiple times everyday.
During this time I began selling my body and prostituting myself to older people for money. I began doing it in order to buy more weed and alcohol and repay my friends for letting me stay in their home. 
I told my friend I was selling myself. I am not sure if I did it in order to gain attention/cry for help/or just wanted money.
My phone recently broke so I have stopped selling myself.
I have not been in school for over 2 years. 
I have only worked 1 job that I was nearly fired from.
I don't have any friends. 
I cannot see my future or past the age of 24.
I often talk to myself. 
I have never been in a serious relationship with anyone. 
I am extremely impulsive.
I get paranoid often.
I've always wanted friends.
I'll try to answer any questions anyone has.
I'm not sure if this should be posted on r/offmychest

83,"I hate myself and trying appreciate my life doesn't do much for me. I am in therapy I hope that it pays off well. I am incredibly lonely with low self esteem, social awkwardness , ADHD, and what is pretty much some form of depression. I want to move forward but I plan to. Originally I never planned how I wanted to die but I knew given ten more years of feeling like this I would probably do it. I got it down to 25. I thought maybe shortly before doing it I might go to Amsterdam or somewhere else really seedy and have sex with prostitutes (because I am pretty sure if I could just get some actual sex I wouldn't be such a lose, obviously I now know that things are a bit more complicated than that) but if it didn't work I'd come home and end it. I'm currently improving in a kind of fucked up way. The idea now is if I reach 30 ill systematically drink myself to death over the course of several years just to give life a bit of a chance in the most fucked way. I don't actually want to die though I fear death but I also fear how long will it take until I just say that I genuinely feel suicidal. I don't think my problems are enough to make me suicidal I feel like a pussy. ",23Jan2018,2
84,"I have really bad GAD &amp; depression. I have plenty of days where I’m the happiest person at work. Cracking jokes and being positive. 

Whenever I do have off days, which are plenty, everybody is always asking what is wrong. I understand why they ask, but if I’m not in this awesome mood they tell me how it’s my fault everybody is in a bad mood and etc...I don’t understand sometimes ",23Jan2018,1
85,"I’m super on the fence in taking antidepressants. I had a nervous breakdown in June 2017, and I’m a lot better. But still unstable and it’s taken a long time for me to reach this point.

Therapy has been helping but I’m worried antidepressants will interfere, but I’ve been told this is not the case (unless they blunt your emotions).

Can antidepressants speed up my recovery in conjunction with therapy?",23Jan2018,1
90,"Hello, I'm a 34 year old male, who has been struggling with anxiety and depression since childhood. I grew up in a family that was very dysfunctional (I won't get into all that) and avoided any kind of help, medical, psychological etc. I was a very energetic kid and instead of my mother trying to focus my attention in a positive way they put me on ridlin, I hated it. it made me sick, felt really dull, and gained weight. I eventually quit taking it, and just tried to deal with my attention issues. In some ways they helped me, I was able to hyper focus on task, find flaws and differences in thing, but I didn't learn how these were valuable until later in life. I really struggled in highschool because I just wasn't interested. I would jump at the chance to do anything else, in fact ""jumping at the chance"" or being ""impulsive"" is probably the best way to describe me. Even to this day, i'm very impulsive, which is not good with a wife and two kids. I struggled in my 20's with not knowing what to do, and then after countless failed careers I made my way to IT, the only thing I've ever been good at. I thought if I made good money, could go on vacations, have nice things I'd one day be happy. I have all those things. I'm not rich but I make good money, and we go on 3+ vacations a year, I have a nice house etc. I'm not happy though. It scares me, I lay in bed at night and can't sleep. I've shared this with my wife to an extent (she's a genuinely great person) but she doesn't struggle with mental illness. It's like a quadriplegic explaining their routine to me, I can empathize but have 0 advice or insight. Sorry for the long diatribe. Simply put how do I get better? I'm scared because of past experiences I've had with medication, and I'm scared of past experiences with psychiatrist when I was a young child. I felt they were very judgy, quickly wanted me to be medicated, and were cold. ",23Jan2018,1
91,"Where do I even begin. 
Like the title says, my mom is 100% convinced that a person she dated and rejected a few years ago has been controlling her life through people in her close proximity, mainly her (former) friends, close ones (me, my sister, her mother, ...) and our neighbors. 

First let me describe this person that I have pieced together through a lot of talking and listening the past 5 years. He is a man she dated 5 years ago and rejected, which in turn lead him to do all these things to her, because ""he never in his life got denied anything and I rejected him, so he is trying to make my life miserable"". He's a Jew (plays a major role in her story) that works for some kind of detective agency which has the sole purpose of making her life miserable. He's extremely well spoken and is a world class hacker, seeing that he can convince literally anyone to do anything to scare her/ make her miserable in some way and can access any information on anyone. Some examples: every electronic device she owns is bugged in some magical way. Laptop? keylogged after every reinstall of the OS. All the phones she had over the years? All bugged. Our router is hacked and send everything she does to him. He can listen to all conversations she has on Skype and by mobile and can read all the text messages she sends and receives. 

Like I mentioned he is also a true master of human psychology, seeing that he can without failure convince literally ANYONE to do ANYTHING. Convince her mother, my grandmother, to say things to her? No problem. Convince the mobile service provider to give him access to every activity on her phone? Check. Convincing a bank to give them all her bank details? Done that. Convince every person of a certain descent to say things to her that would in a very specialized way remind her of him? Done that to at least 20 people I know of. 
He does this by either searching for deep, dark secrets in the lives of people that would convince them to fulfill every command he gives them, seeing that otherwise he would ""spread these secrets to the right people to ruin their lives"". As I mentioned, I myself can name at least 20-30 people that she thinks are fulfilling or have fulfilled his commands, and pointing out that there is literally no person on this planet with the power to hack into the lives of at least 30 people around the globe, unveil their darkest secrets, make them shut up about the fact that this person literally invaded their whole personal life to find dirt on them, and to make them perform some stupid thing like ""mentioning that there is a really nice Jewish district in the town she was born"" or to make someone of her friends give her a kid's bible, only to find that there is a dried leaf in there that ""she picked up on a date with him, which he kept and put in that book just to years later give it to her to remind her of him"". 
She multiple times has claimed that he can write messages using accounts of other people because she can ""recognize his writing style anywhere"". She dated a person a year or 2 ago, but this was set up from the beginning to gain even more control of her. 
I can go on and on about different scenario's where she is convinced that her life is being controlled, heck even when our water boiler broke down, the guys that came to fix it were hired to install bugs, camera's or something of that sort in our home... 

How do I deal with this? Tomorrow morning we are going to a psychologist to discuss this issue, but she doesn't want to talk to her when I am around because I would interrupt her. I for one am afraid that she will say that everything is fine and dandy, fearing that the psychologist will eventually be part of the system. 
Even if I talk to the professional myself, she will not be able to discuss the things that she discussed with her and I'm afraid that if any doubt or speck of mistrust forms between her and the psychologist, that seeking professional help will be off the table...
She already announced that ""this is probably all part of his master plan to put me in a psyche ward or to dismiss any claim that I will have against him when I will go to the police with all the evidence that I have collected on the ground that I am mentally ill"" (She has 0 evidence to speak of or to show for, while I showed her years ago how to screenshot something)  
What makes me the most afraid is that during one of these extremely ridiculous stories I once said that I absolutely do not believe her. This lead to her having an extreme mental episode where she was declaring that one of these days she was going to disappear and never come back or she will simply slit her throat ... not something that a son wants to hear from his mother. This lead to me having a mental breakdown, were I couldn't keep myself from bursting into tears the following days when I even thought back to those word.

How do I proceed in this situation? Every logical argument in the book has allready been used, but to no avail. Continuing like this is no option, because I am extremely afraid that something one day is going to send her over the edge to do the unthinkable.

tldr; My mother has a really severe case of paranoia and has already multiple times considered and even threatened to coming suicide. What are the best steps I can undertake in this situation and has someone experienced something even remotely similar to her situation?",23Jan2018,1
