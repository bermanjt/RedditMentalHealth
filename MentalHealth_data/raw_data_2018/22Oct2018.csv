I am emotionally spent right now. I am exhausted past the point of exhausted. I didn't eat much today, which didn't help. I have no energy left right now and I am feeling very down in the dumps. I just need a huggle. I don't know how to express myself right now.",22Oct2018,1

2,"I am curious what makes my brain so different than others who have gone through similar things. I watched my mother die when I was 3 years old. Growing up I endured physical abuse, emotional abuse and sexual abuse. Violence and drugs were a daily thing in my household. I was neglected, forgotten and was left to fend for myself for most of my childhood and teenage years. I never had a stable environment, no sense of security or safety. I was reminded daily that the world would be better off without me.... from my own family. 

My question is, why didn’t I turn into a random serial killer or drug addict? Why was it so easy for me to break the abuse cycle.... when I see so many people who couldn’t. I can’t say I walked away completely unfazed. I have trouble making lasting relationships. (Except for my spouse who has thankfully been with me for 21 years). I have challenges with anxiety and frequently doubt myself. I attempted suicide several times when I was younger. I never turned to drugs, alcohol, violence or abuse. I am trying really hard to change my mind frame from victim to victor. I rarely talk about my experiences. I need to figure out why my brain is different so I can finish evolving past my early life.  Any ideas?",22Oct2018,1

4,"Whenever my (28f) boyfriend and I part ways I cry.  Even if I know I'm going to see him in a day or two.  We live apart but in the same city so it's a bit wacky.  In addition to the first outburst of tears I will also tear up and get an intense feeling of sadness when I enter the room we recently hung out in or see the dirty dishes from the food we made or see the clothes I wore, just anything that reminds me of the time we had.  

I also get severely upset and cry like a maniac for the two days after I say goodbye to my parents who I only see a handful of times a year because they live far away and I feel guilty not being around more.  But I have to work and just can't.  When I'm with my parents I usually am up crying the night before our visit is over.  

I was never abandoned as a child or anything.  Have had a great childhood and life on paper but have had on and off depression since my teen years.  

Is this separation anxiety?  Is there a treatment?  I would like to try therapy but it's not covered by my insurance and I'm fucking broke.  One day I'll go to therapy because this seems to be a lifelong issue.  I've had this as long as I can remember.  

Just looking for information and coping strategies.  Thanks.

5,"I have a few friends who have depression, and they have a serious reason. Their mum walked out, my other friend's mum passed away and she was abused and stuff, etc.

And then there's me. I have a family that care about me, I have friends, alright grades, etc

So why do I feel like this? By 'this' I mean, idk depressed I guess. I feel like it's cringey to say I'm depressed, it feels attention seeky to say it but idk. I could get into exactly how I feel everyday but that's not what this is about, I just wish I had a reason.

9,One of my big triggers for feeling suicidal is the thought of rejection by women and society and even fake women or the image of. This really makes me feel worthless and alone knowing how little I matter in the world. It’s really stressful and tiring. What’s worse yet is all my social connections are weak and superficial .

10,"I have a friend who has mental health issues with depression, anxiety, self-image, and relationships. He has told me many times that he is depressed and chooses not to show it to others. After attempt at suicide and spending time in the mental hospital, he continues his habits of drinking, which brings out the depression and influences his hysterical, and sometimes suicidal episodes. I am the only person who cares to help him, not even he, himself, is looking to make the changes necessary in his life to get better.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you go about helping this person? I have tried time and again to monitor him when he drinks or even suggested many times that he should quit drinking altogether. I have also suggested he takes a break from school and move back to his hometown to focus on himself. He associates specific aspects of his current life to be important (his social life mainly), which is why he is finding it hard to make changes. However, the very thing he values is what is causing these patterns of mental breakdowns. Every weekend these breakdowns happen and they are getting worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I care a lot about him and want to see him in a good light, but can't offer any more guidance or help on my part because everything I try doing is ineffective. How might I go about finding him help?

TL;DR- my friend has mental health issues. They are getting worse. He knows to stop drinking. He refuses help of any kind (including therapy), and has told me he is wanting to change, but doesn't make changes for himself.",22Oct2018,1

Is this what I've become?

It seems like just yesterday

I was a child

Not many memories of that time

But it couldn't all be bad

Could it?

Now I fight a demon

Or three

Depression

Anxiety

And the big one

Pyromania

Why...why must I suffer so?

From my own mind attacking me

For even when I sleep

Thoughts of fire

Dreams of infernos

Restless mumblings

Insomnia is a blessing

A respite from the dreams

But when awake

I need to act on those impulses

Leaving me in no better shape

I am tired

But the grip of this demon is strong

It won't let go

I feel myself falling again

Back into the grip

Back into the hole

I go willingly

I don't want to fight it anymore

Forever part of fire

And fire is part of me

It is starting again

Here I go.",22Oct2018,1

19,"Hello Everyone! 

I’m a mental health advocate interested in documenting stories of people’s experiences with mental health and wellness. I’m an executive member for a non-profit and student-led organization called “In Visibility”. This is a recognized group at the University of Toronto Scarborough aiming to spread awareness on issues surrounding mental health and wellness. 

We recently launched a project called “Humans In Visibility (acronym: HIV)” with a purpose to document people’s experiences coping with and overcoming mental health related challenges. It was inspired from the quite popular series “Humans in New York”, which also showcases the candid stories of NYC residents in order to build a sense of community and spread ideas to its audience. Our goal with the HIV project is to similarly provide a platform through social media to authentically showcase people’s experiences living through mental health related challenges. This is to further emphasize the message that mental health and wellness is a universal challenge for everyone thus, we hope the HIV project will help reduce stigmatization surrounding these topics. 

The HIV project is planned to start posting stories on October 21, 2018, and will continue over the next 7 months. We are currently accepting submissions from anyone who is interested and willing to share their personal stories through our platform. All submitted stories will be 100% confidential and anonymous to the public media in order to protect your privacy. 

Every month throughout our social media platforms, we will post stories highlighting a particular theme related to mental health and wellness. The theme for October is: “Dealing with Midterm Stress and Anxiety”. We would love to hear your take on how you manage midterm stress (or just stress/anxiety in general) to showcase to the world. 

If you are interested to share your story in this project, please send a direct message or email to our contact. We hope to hear from you soon! :)

Anyways, I've been having some issues where anxiety arises from specific thoughts.

These thoughts are the idea that my loved ones, specifically my girlfriend, will die someday. When I think about how my girlfriend will die, whether it be by natural causes or a freak accident, I am filled with so much sadness and anxiety. It just hurts knowing there's nothing I can do and it sometimes makes me wish I never got into the relationship in the first place despite how much I love her.

22,"For the record, when I was depressed, I was never suicidal, had suicidal ideation or self harmed. I’m not referring to anything of that nature....

Now that I’m not depressed and back to my happy and normal self, I notice I’ve picked up some bad habits that went away while I was depressed (easily distracted, spending more time on social media/watching tv, sometimes less motivated). 

I guess I feel like being depressed gave me something to work hard towards (not being depressed/feeling back to myself). Now I feel like I don’t have the drive to motivate myself to do those things. Also to note.... I’m not sitting on my ass all day doing nothing. I actually AM pretty productive, for the most part, on a daily basis with school, work, working out, studying, etc....

I’ll go out once in a while. It’s great. But after working 100+ hours in less than a week, I’m NOT going to be up much past midnight. Let alone go out.

I dont think I'm getting anything out of counseling, as im generally too unwilling to give information to someone I dont trust too much. I find it pretty hard to want to get out of bed in the morning, and the only reason I do nowadays is an obligation to not be a degenerate slug and suck the life out of my parents. I work hard, I always do the best when I am too, got multiple excellence reviews over just the past 3 days when I was working, and I have been working this job for 2 years now. I can push myself to do anything for someone else, but I dont ever have the energy or motivation to do something for fun any more. I guess I'm just lonely, being that my last friend wont talk to me anymore after finding out that I was depressed, calling me a liar and a weakling, and it hurts to know that he thought like that for the past 12 years we've been friends and I never could have talked to him about anything like that. But I guess it's better I dont talk to him anymore. I have definitely gained or lost a lot of weight, dont know which way, have to kept track. I used to be kinda strong and I was fit for a while but I just dont have the motivation to get strong again. I've mostly pushed away people that started to try to become my friends, and even with my old friend gone I dont find myself trying to create new ties, even though I know a lot of people, and most of them are very kind.

30,"Hello,

I'm a frequenter of r/depression, but feel this post might be a better fit here:

If it matters- I'm currently on an antidepressant that I like that's done wonders to just get me out and up and interested in life again- to a degree.

I have had issues with being taking advantage of in my personal life- it's a definite pattern. I'm making steps to change it- dropping one sided friendships, leaning into a healthy support network, etc. Maybe bc I've spent so long acquiescing to the will of others, (including a traditional family I've had to please by acting to their wishes) I've lost the ability to express my likes, but also go out of my way to not let people accommodate those likes. 

For example, if someone takes an interest in my interest, asking about it because I like it and they want to learn more, I'll go out of my way to retreat and say I  actually I don't like it. I'll get strange and withdrawn and kind of shut down, even if I was having a normal and cheery conversation before. Why can't I take ownership of things I like/vocalize my desires? Is this a symptom if a larger disassociative thing? I'm currently in the throes of being pretty aimless in terms of my career (I'm in my early 30s).  And despite the positive effects of my antidepressant I still struggle with some things, a major one being letting my home fall into a pretty gross state of negligence bc I just don't care enough about myself/my living space. 

What does this mean? I couldn't really find the right words for this to Google it. I hope I'm making sense now. ",22Oct2018,1

35,"Title really says it all, and I'm not even sure if this is the place to ask.

I'm a 21 M and I seem to have an impossible time developing relationships with people because I can't seem to stop judging them for some reason. It seems like every time I meet someone, it starts out great, like every time I'm around them is something to look forward to. Whatever drew me to them in the first place really stands out and it just becomes enjoyable to see them. Which is saying a lot as I generally don't feel enjoyment in anything.

It all goes great until it doesn't. Usually after some time my perception of them changes drastically. The most minor things become major annoyances. I pretty much begin looking for faults, no matter how small, and it feels like I purposely try to lower my own image of people for some reason.

The real issue is that I've been really wanting to find something more meaningful in my life. I had been spending a good amount of time just looking for quick hook ups, not even caring who it was with as long as they said yes, but now I want something real. 

I actually met someone who I thought might have been a good match, but I've been too afraid to ask her out and now she told me she might start seeing someone and the idea that she'll brush me aside in favor of someone else absolutely destroys me. She's the only one I've been able to  really talk to and be serious with about stuff like this, and I know she doesn't have any obligations to me, but I'm still scared of not seeing her as often, or even just not staying in contact as much.

39,"Last month or so, I purchased 4x US domestic airline tickets and bought the standard TripMate Insurance along with it. Flight will start early next month, and now one of our members is getting severe anxiety regarding the trip to the point they're complaining about physical symptoms, but Dr. only says it's still anxiety (they went to the ER once already).

We're considering cancelling in hopes of our insurance fully refunding our 4x tickets, but reading through the Plan Document, in the bottom, it mentions they are not liable for: a mental or nervous condition, unless hospitalized.

Chances are very low that our friend will get hospitalized - maybe they'll get sent to the ER again due to extent of issues.

So we're wondering if anyone has experience filing a claim for just anxiety or any mental illness? Do these insurance brokers give any flexibility? Any alternatives for this to get us covered? I read there's some insurances that cover any cancellation, but I don't see online a way to upgrade - would trying to call help?

Trip doesn't really make sense without all of us together, so any help or feedback on best way to approach is much appreciated. Thank you for your time.

[I have a severe phobia of contracting a specific disease](https://www.reddit.com/r/Phobia/comments/964k24/severe_phobia_of_contracting_a_specific_disease/), it's so bad I can't name it or discuss the symptoms. I got treatment to prevent the disease. Before that, I was literally suicidal because I came to the (obvious) conclusion that dead people can't catch the disease. I'm so terrified that I was fully prepared to kill myself to make sure I'd never catch it. The treatment has helped tremendously.

I found this article online:

&gt; [""last year I went through several months of fantasizing about killing myself because I couldn't cope with the constant, unrelenting fear and nausea. **I'm not afraid to die because when you die, you don't vomit. [...] I had it all meticulously planned down to a tee—the idea of death was, and to a much lesser extent now still is, more tolerable to me than vomiting.**""](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avyzqb/living-with-emetophobia)",22Oct2018,1
41,So I'm an 18 year old guy and ever since my freshman year of high school I've wanted to die. It started because I felt overwhelmed and nothing I did was helping my grades and it got so stressful that for some reason it made me depressed and wish I was dead so I wouldn't have to deal with the troublesome things in life. The feeling of wanting to die and wishing I was dead has persisted for the following 5 years. Even when I'm happy it lasts for a couple hours at most because I know things are going to go back to being stressful since it never fails to. I don't care much about how killing myself would affect my family except for my little brother. This is the one thing that fucking destroys me inside. Hes only 9 and me and him get along greatly. He comes to me every time over his other brother and sister because we get along the best and always have a blast. A lot of the time we will hang out all day and always have a great time I feel that we have a stronger bond than anyone else in my family. But when I think of killing myself I think of how badly it would affect him and knowing how destroyed it would leave him makes me want to bawl my eyes out every time I think of it. ,22Oct2018,1
42,"When I'm in public I always think about screaming something like fire or rape or nigger because they are the worst things I can say. I never do it, but unless I distract myself that's what my mind spends time thinking about.

Another example, if I'm ever on a catwalk or the second floor of a building, I'll imagine throwing something like my cell phone down and destroying it. The image plays in my head like a gif and my hands tic until I leave.

Opinion? I don't act on it which makes me feel like it's not what I think it would be.",22Oct2018,1

I would like to share my experiences of being a mental health patient. I was referred to mental health services, as I had planned to commit suicide. A Mental Health Act (MHA) Assessment (which is used to decide whether an individual should be sectioned) was arranged, but as a doctor was not able to arrive on time, thankfully this never went ahead, but it shows just how useless the service is.

I was then seen by two mental health nurses, from a mental health crisis team, a few days later. One nurse told my sister that I had been to A&amp;E multiple times, when I have been 4 times in 24 years, (at 13, 21, 23, &amp; 24), which demonstrated her poor comprehension skills and or dishonesty. She also fiddled with her acrylics and rolled her eyes, which gave me the impression that she was trying to discredit my experiences and the seriousness of my emotional distress, which was rude, unprofessional &amp; lacking in empathy.

When I discussed bullying that I had experienced as a student nurse, both nurses stated that they had trained in the same trust, and not been bullied, which was a way of further discrediting my experiences, and their experiences were not relevant to my assessment at all. The male nurse then said that if I did not engage with a home treatment team, and a community mental health team (CMHT), that he would arrange a MHA assessment.

However, I didn’t engage with the home treatment team, as the staff were bone idle, and unable to answer basic, mundane questions such as ‘What is your name?’, but a MHA assessment wasn’t arranged. So, the nurse had used a section as a proxy, which is the threat of a section as leverage, and is an abuse of professional power. I wasn’t referred to CMHT either as the crisis team were useless and didn’t make the referral.

I was then seen by the male nurse from the crisis team again, with a female social worker. He said he would like to see me one more time, before he discharges me. He also asked me whether I had posted about staff involved in my care on Facebook, and I had done so.

I was advised to write this in a Poundland notebook, and complain to organisations, rather than post on social media, which was intrusive, and I am free to discuss my poor care with whom and where I want, and this was not relevant to my assessment, and as a patient I am not duty bound by confidentiality.

I was then seen by the same nurse again and the service manager a few days later. In a phone call prior to the visit I told the nurse that I still had some cleaning to do, before they arrived.

“That’s fine, no need to kill yourself over it.”
I broke a bit more inside when he said that.

During the visit he asked me whether I had contacted my university lecturer, as I said that I would during the last visit, but I was upset the day I planned to call her and hadn’t done so, and I didn’t need to justify myself to him. He then said that he would contact her and share my 3 assessments with her. I told him he didn’t have my permission to do so, and he told me he didn’t need my permission.

He also said he wasn’t going to discharge me because I was ‘anxious’, and had ‘reacted to something small,’ and that he’d used ‘professional judgement.’ I wasn’t anxious, I was angry and upset, which are normal reactions to abuse of power, and abuse of power is no small thing, and his ‘professional judgement’ is severely impaired.

He also said he was going to ‘arrange a professional’s meeting and invite my university lecturer,’ and ‘it would be decided whether a MHA assessment was needed.’ I challenged him on this and asked him and his manager what their reason was for this, and what professional code, legislation or trust policy would justify sharing my confidential healthcare information, without my informed consent, with my lecturer, and they weren’t able to answer this.

I also challenged him about his suicide joke, and he did not acknowledge or apologise for this, which shows he lacks insight and remorse. I became quite upset during this assessment, and the manager responded by smiling. My upset, and distress was giving her something to smile about. The manager then ended the visit with “It was nice to meet you Gul,” and I replied “Well, it wasn’t nice to meet you Liz.”

I then contacted the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and was advised that unless the trust had a policy which stated that my healthcare information could be shared with a university lecturer, then if it was shared, confidentiality would be breached. I then called the complaints department and was told that the information governance policy did not state that my healthcare information, could be shared in this way, and I was emailed the policy.
I also asked my lecturer if my assessments could be shared with her and she said ‘No, as I had the right to a private life,’ and when I asked whether she could be invited to a meeting about my healthcare, she said ‘Absolutely not.’ 

The male nurse then called me the next day, and I told him I didn’t want to speak to him, as I had complained about him. My lecturer also told me that he had called her, and she told him he could not discuss me with her.

I then called the crisis line twice, for an update on my healthcare, and both call handlers refused to give me this information, so I was unaware what my care and treatment was, whether a ‘professional’s meeting’ had been arranged, and whether I was even still a patient. I was told that I could not be updated about my healthcare because I had made a complaint, despite this contravening the trust’s complaints policy.

So, a MHA assessment was not arranged, and neither was the so-called ‘professional’s meeting’, and after 8 days of being kept in the dark, I was called to say I had been discharged. I have now raised a formal complaint, with the help of an NHS complaints advocate, and if I’m not satisfied with the outcome I shall make a referral to The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.

I have also referred the 2 crisis team nurses and their manager to the Nursing and Midwifery council (NMC), for dishonesty and abuse of professional power. A senior nurse and a service manager not being aware of their own trusts policies, and what it enables them to do and not do with patient’s confidential information is an organisational failure, so for that reason I referred the Trust to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). I will also contact The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) for the attempted breach of The Data Protection Act (1998), and I will share my experiences with Care Opinion, Healthwatch, NHS improvements, and The Patient Experience Team.

Overall, the mental health staff were abusive, bullies, callous, coercive, dishonest, disrespectful, judgemental, and completely and utterly useless, and have only traumatised me further.

I’m still suicidal, and it’s taking everything in me and everything out of me to stay alive. I do need help for my mental health, but because of the actions of the mental health staff, I’m too afraid to seek the help. If it wasn’t for my sister, my close friend and my own resilience I would be dead.

44,"Hi, guys

This is a bit of my story..... and I only tell it I can't open up to people in RL about it because I just can't get the words to pass my lips.

So, when I was growing up my father ended his life due to battling severe depression and yeah he was referred to a mental hospital after he tried to seek help for his depression. It was one chat with a doctor and then he was sent there and very rarely allowed out of it. So, one day he got out of the hospital ( I don't even know how because as everyone tells different stories I no longer listen to their stories ) and yeah he visited my family and he went to a park and hung himself. A week after he ended his life social services gave me and someone else back to the family. Now, I won't talk about the very dark dark stuff but I'll say it in a light way. Because of his suicide (he did it because social services wouldn't give me and someone else back) the family no longer wanted us. They never wanted us but nor did they want us to be adopted or to have anything nice because in their eyes we were responsible at an age younger than 2 years old for his suicide. So, yeah we were both molested by a few four family members. I was left with my disabled sister that everyone knows is disabled but hides it to look after me and she was the worst one (she's the one who caused me to have 80% of the mental scars that I have today) but yeah she was horrific as she would go from trying to suffocate me to trying to drown me to biting me until I bled to strangling and physically abusing me and she pierced my ear for an hour as I screamed but only got me to shut up by waving a cold knife in my face and holding it up against my cheek when I was around two or three years old. I was locked away in the cellar from the age of four until I was around six or seven years old and I remember one day when I social worker came to the house and saw me with a big black eye she and my mum laughed about it. So, yeah. I don't know for sure but I think that my mum used to take pictures of me naked (I have vague memories of it thanks to someone who never fails to remind me what happened to me) and I think that she used to do it in secret but at night time. But she did watch me get assaulted in that awful way definitely once but maybe more. So, yeah because of what they all did to me when I was 6 years old I'd ask god to kill me but he never did. I was six and I would say ""just let me die"" and then when I was eight years old I knew that I wanted to end my life but when I was ten years old I tried to end it all and failed so badly. So after that I spent my time and I still am spending my time in the care system where I am doing time for their crimes and I say this because in care I was groped by a male keyworker and the amount of times where I've had staff hit me it's a lot of times but most of the times I never told anyone because I thought that I deserved it as I was always taught when I was small that any beating I got was because of me and sometimes when I did tell the managers nothing ever happened and the one who would hurt me (there were a few) would be allowed to work on shift but at ""the house"" rather than the ""bungalow"" which is where I was staying at and he would walk across the field and look over at me and smile like as if to say "" look, what are they even doing about it?"".In another care home (both apparently therapeutic ones) my carer who was the aunty to one of the managers kids (something like that J ) would hit me in front of staff even as I sometimes hit her back to get her of me because I was 15 and she was in her 40's, she also got away with it even when she made me bleed from my waist after she heavily banged a door into me. I found out that she was only taken of shift whilst I was there and apparently she was working back there as soon as I'd left (the other kid told me) and so yeah. It was never easy but the foster placement in December was what opened my eyes to everything and really taught me that I was nothing because they were both nice to me during transitions but after transitions (once I lived there) they were awful. The dad was the threatening one who swore and ordered his wife about sometimes whilst he would call her a ""bitch"" and the wife who was the main foster carer was the one who was very cruel. She was financially incredibly greedy and I could just about get shower gel and some other toiletries out of her. She never left food out everyday for me and she treated me as second class to all of her children and to her other foster child as she regarded her as her daughter but me as a ""young person"" and so yeah. She was a tough one. It took 19 or 20 days for her to help me completely spiral downwards. So, after all these years I don't want to be alive still and I think that I'm just gonna do it very soon because the anguish that I feel everyday is un-bearable and I can't stand crying about it all almost daily in my bedroom. I tried to stay for everyone but my life chances are just bleak because I go to school that isn't even rated ""good"" and I've practically had the state tell me my worth many times and that is ""worthless"" just by putting me in bad placements and schools. So, I think that I'm gonna go because it's easier to be gone than to have to face this battle on my own. It's not like I can even ask for help because social services view getting help as being mentally unstable and they use it against you when it suits them. So, I'm fighting a losing battle. I just so badly want out of it even if I have to stand in front of a train then so be it. I have to go because I can't be listening to this fake shit of ""it gets better"" or ""time heals old wounds"" as it's not like those people saying it have been through it. I just wish that I had someone who I could actually talk to and someone who could help me with some of my education before I went by helping me with my maths etc but yeah.. ",22Oct2018,1
45,"Hello /rmentalhealth,

I have been suffering from social anxiety and depression from when i was 10 years old. (diagnosed at age 27, i knew way before tough)

I had a panic disorder starting as a very small child, for as long as i can remember. 

&amp;#x200B;

So at some point i developed a really intense drive to free myself from this suffering and i started to do a lot of sports. I got into meditation and recentlly yoga. And i read up in different selfhelp books, spiritual books and i studied psychology. 

I am doing this for 10 years now, and there is progress. But at some point the depression comes back, the anxiety comes back and it has really bad impacts on my career &amp; personal relationships. It feels like i hit a wall right now, because when i am free of those negative feelings, people are attracted to me, it is easier to be myself, even with my weaknesses &amp; all is well. The moment it comes back, at least romantic relationships turn away and i perform very badly at work + am very anxious around people, not showing myself and not being ok with whom i am. Consequences are for instance no career advances. Until now it wasnt that important as i am just finishing my masters degree and it was mainly internships &amp; bartender jobs. However, i am starting a new position as a recruiter in january and it would be very bad if i got fired there or just underperformed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same with romantic relationships, at first when i feel fine girls like me, but i get this depressive feeling and some point, and get anxious, and they turn away. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the last couple of days i was in a deep hole of depression again, and i can't do jack to get out of it. I try to do sports, i try meditation,....but still.  I am also in psychotherapy for a year now. 

Thing is, i have these days when i am absolutely well. There is no depression and only minimal anxiety. I feel present to the moment and connected to the people around me. But it all falls back into depression at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And i definately want to do well in my next job and not lose it over my mental conditions. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So how can i deal with this recurring depression and anxiety? 

I am entertaining the idea of getting medication, SSRI(Antidepressants) and Alprazolam(Antianxiety), 

SSRI i would to for longterm use, Alprazolam when needed. 

What is you guys take on that? Any specific SSRI you would recommend me? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys have any other things i should consider doing as a healing modality, medication or otherwise, legal or not, i am completely open to do anything that helps me get out of that pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**List of things i already tried:** 

Vipassana 10 day course

Osho Meditation

Yoga

Intense sports

healthy diet

Piracetam 

Selegilin

Various drugs - liberate in the short term, bad consequences in the long term

Julien Blanc - Transformation mastery program (kinda a mix between spirituality and Jungian Psychoanalytical ideas)

Supplements like: Ginkgo, Ginseng, Ashwaghanda, Bacop monnieri ( although i have to try that one more), Schizandra berries, Holy Basil, Vitamin D, Vitamin B.

46,"I hope this is good subreddit to post this.

Firstly, hello everyone, i hope you're all doing good. This is my first post here, so I wanted to greet You :)

I've been feeling pretty low for the most of my life. I've realized that I'm just a trash of a person, a scumfuck who can't socialize, who is made mostly of downsides and never will be able to operate in this world like a normal person. On top of this realization, situation in my family is fucked up too. Everything is starting to not make sense anymore. Someday in the past it suddenly got worse, as I've found a some kind of pleasure in selfharm. It validates me, gives outlet from emotions when there are too many and makes me feel something, when I don't feel anything (I'm not encouraging anyone to start this tho) . Thoughts of suicide haunt me on daily basis too. I imagine myself hanging or under the wheels of train. 

And even though my situation looks like this, I'm scared to go anywhere for help. Because objectively I have a quite good life. I am not poor, I study at good university, my family kind of loves me. I'm scared that everyone to whom I may turn to will say that I'm doing this for attention, nothing is wrong with me and will tell me to stop doing this. I was considering going to the psychologist, but I'm afraid what he will tell me. ""You're perfectly fine, why would feel and do things like these? There's nothing wrong with you, just GTFO from my office.""

I don't know anymore. When I read other's stories about these tragic situations, I think that I'm insulting them, daring to put myself on the same spot. That I maybe really should stop. But really, I can't. I can't stop crying, I can't stop cutting and thinking about suicide. It's because I know that I'm a kind of person who don't have anything to offer to the world.

Sorry for the long post. I wanted it to be me asking for advice, but it turned out to be a vent. Thanks for reading. Take care!",22Oct2018,1

51,"Hey folks,

as many of you, I am dealing with panic, depression, the feeling of constantly being overwhelmed and failing...list goes on and you sure could add stuff to it. I also want to seek therapy. But now something is happening to my body as well and I wanted to ask, if anyone experienced something similar or even the same. Or has any serious idea.

So I always could sleep like a baby. Life is on fire, but my sleep couldn't be disturbed (lucky me, I am grateful for that). But since this summer I experience the following: You know restless leg syndrome? It feels like someone hooked your body to a electricity source. It crawls under your skin and you want to shake and twitch to get rid of this sudden energy pulses. I had it in my leg sometimes, now I have it in my whole body. Hands, arms, chest, heart... ""Crawling in my skin"" - Linkin Park describe it well. I had it when I had to study hard, and everytime I want to sleep. Now what makes me think it is linked to my mental state is the following:

I live in city A, where I also go to university. My boyfriend lives in city B, I visit him on the weekends. (A and B are very close). I only have that ""sensation"", when I am in A. I am starting to think, that it is subconscious panic. Because studying causes constant panic in me. The pressure alone, but also the constant fear of missing something, failing, etc. I cannot sleep or lay down anymore when I am in A. It has to be neuronal, I think. A osteopath I went to told me my muscles are relaxed but my inner me is racing. I will talk to my doctor about it anyway, but wanted to hear your opinions/ experiences.

And because it's a long text anyway: I want to thank each and everyone on here. It feels so good to read your stories and responses. It made me much more confident in my decision to go to therapy. I wish you all strength.

55,"So, I am struggling with an issue...

I know that I should see a therapist or doctor, but right now I don't think that is on my list.

I have always been anxious (biting my nails, pulling off hair, fiddling), but I went to a general practitioner and my mother mentioned one of my rituals, and the doctor mentioned the possibility of me having OCD tendencies. She told me to go to a psychologist to explore this further, but I didn't get around to it.

The things that occur in my life are the following:

\- Whenever I leave my house (when I travel mostly), I cannot stop checking in my pockets for my wallet and phone. This gets insane. I get the ""making sure you're not forgetting anything"" scenario, but when I'm traveling the thought of having forgotten anything gets obsessive. I keep on going through the list in my head. ""Okay... I have my wallet on my left pocket (always on my left), I have my phone on my right (they're roughly the same size and weight so it balances out) and have my documents in the 2nd pocket of my backpack."" This same list repeats itself for at least 100 times during my journey. This is accompanied with me touching my pockets and opening my backpack to make sure it's all there.

\- When I get anxious I come to my living room and I pace around my square table for at least 40 minutes. It has to be this table or any table that is square so I walk the same amount in each side. I do this until it feels right, I never really count anything related to this. I often get tired and out of breath since I walk relatively fast for a long period of time. I have a track, as in, I get close to the table at the corners and open up at the edges of the table (this may be confusing.) I can't stand being interrupted until I deem appropriate. I just can't. Sometimes I just do this because I'm bored.

\- I'm studying for some standardized tests and school exams, and I get some practice problems (multiple choice). When I put down my answers to some questions it's all good. Then I go to check the answers, and oh my god, I have to check at least 14 times to check if I got the right letter choices. I really don't see the logic of this, I already saw that I got the answers correctly, but I have to check again and again because maybe I didn't see it correctly. This is one example of this, but there some other very similar things related to school. This gets very annoying.

\- When I scroll some pictures on social media, I have to re-check that I saw a picture I liked at least 14 times. I have to scroll back up and align the bottom and top of the image to center it and to check that I actually saw the picture. I know I saw it but I have to check it again because maybe I didn't.

\- I have something with the number 14 since 13 is bad luck you go one more so it isn't bad luck.

\- I also pick a lot of scabs on my face and arms to the point that I start full out bleeding. The table is red with bloodstains when I rest my arm. I don't really notice.

\- Fear of getting stabbed when someone holds a sharp knife close to me. I start imagining the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

This is all that I can think of right now. A lot of these are nonsense and I know they are, but I can't stop. I consider myself smart, but I am starting to think otherwise since I have such nonsensical thoughts and behaviors.

I am not seeking for a diagnosis, but simply an indication about whether I have signs of OCD. I have something, this cannot be normal and sometimes it gets so frustrating I cry myself to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I also may have some other rituals that I may not be remembering, but the ones mentioned are the most significant ones.

58,"I think there’s something wrong with me. For the last year or so I’ve been having these weird episodes of either suicidal thoughts and depression or extreme happiness and a feeling of being almost invincible. 

It’s coming to a point where I don’t know how to deal with this anymore. I’ve had a great period recently for almost two weeks and I woke up this morning with tons of energy but out of nowhere I just got this feeling of sadness and now I’m typing this and I feel like I’m about to cry. 

Sorry I don’t know to express all of this in english, I’m doing my best.

When I’m having a good period I have so much energy and ambition. I’m starting projects and taking on tasks left and right and I want to be super productive. I do crazy activities and I almost feel addicted to adrenaline. 

When I’m having a bad period I just wanna cry and not get out of bed. I’ve had suicidal thoughts but not to the point where I’ve actually tried to end my life. I’ve told my girlfriend that I just want to stop existing, I just wanna fade away. 

I also feel bad about feeling all of these feeling. I have nothing to complain about. My personal life is good, I have a great relationship, a nice place to live and I’ve just started college. Sure I don’t have that much money but I’m not in any kind of debt.

It just feels like any kind of setback is like the end of the world. When I’m feeling down everything just looks grey and I’m having a hard time staying awake even tho I sleep 8 hours a night.

I also start questioning if my feelings are even real at all. I’ve tried to tell myself to just snap out of it when I feel sad. I know how to feel good so I should just be able to get back to that feeling. 

I can feel when the sadness is coming and I domstolens even tell myself ”here we go again”. It feels so stupid, I almost wonder if I somehow create this bad feeling myself but it feels so real and when I’m in it I just can’t get out of it. 

I can go around like a depressed zombie for weeks and then all of a sudden I just start feeling happy again out of nowhere. When I’m happy it feels like the world is sparkling with colors and I love how that feels, I wish I could be in that state of mind all the time.

This post is getting long. My girlfriend has told me to seek help but I can’t help but feel that my sadness is fake and something I create in my head and I just need to man up and get out of it.

I struggled with depression for about two years before these episodes started happening. I’m in my early twenties if that helps.

I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid the feelings sadness will only get worse.

Thanks for reading this far if you did and sorry if I expressed myself in a weird way

I just don’t feel like my life has any point. I wonder for how long people would be sad before they moved on if i killed myself.

59,"I still live with my family at the moment and it's not that I hate spending time with them but after a certain point at night (usually past 9 pm) I really just want to be completely alone to the point that I get irritated, sometimes even anxious when I can hear people walking around or hear the noises they make (I don't mind when I hear noises from the TV though). Most of the time I even stay up for hours to wait for them to all fall asleep because I just feel at ease when I know I'm the only one awake at night. 

I can't pinpoint what would be making me feel this way. Is this a symptom of anxiety or maybe mild depression? ( Sorry I don't mean to seem ignorant i just don't really have easy access to mental health education or services where I'm from) ",22Oct2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

Monday: Finally decided to write down my thoughts when I get into this strange state. Once I get out of it, I can no longer even think the same thoughts or reason why I was feeling like that. It's strange. Almost like a second person is living in my mind. Don't know if I'll share this with anyone. I suppose when it feels like I'll lose control I might? Idk. When I'm normal, everything feels fine and I was just being irrational. I don't want to seek help, but when I'm ""in my insane or manic state?"", I feel like I can't take it anymore. It feels like torture like I'm being tortured by my mind and I can't stand just sitting there. It's hard to describe when I'm not feeling it but I just remember last night feeling like I couldn't go on like this anymore. It was mentally painful.

Last night: couldn't go to sleep, lying in bed until 5 AM, feel like I'm trapped in a cage in my mind. Feels physically uncomfortable, crying a lot, absolutely dreading the next day and having to do things, don't know why though. Nothing hard but for some reason it seems so daunting

yesterday: went to the library to study, felt fine at first, suddenly got frustrated at classes bc not getting material. Got unreasonably upset/angry. Couldn't control my emotions. Punched myself in the head, don't know why. Continually spiraled downward into a mix of anger one minute then sadness and crying the next. This continued from about 3:00 - 8:00. I don't know why this is happening. I've done much harder things. My life is so easy right now. Why does it feel hard. Why does the simplest of things feel difficult. Anyway, after about 8 until midnight it was just a feeling of apathy and gloom. Staring at screen fighting to regain motivation and concentration. I remember feeling weak, not metaphorically weak (well yes but that's not the point I'm getting at). I felt physically weak. My hand was shaking and I felt like I had zero physical strength. 

two days ago: Don't remember many details but remember that I cried from maybe 4 - 7. Always a mix of trying to fight to regain control for a moment then just losing it.

Today (updated): Feels like this is the hardest week of my life but if I remove myself and look at what I have to do, it's easy. I can't continue on like this. I think I'm going crazy. I can't control my emotions or mind. It feels like there are two max's. I was walking to the library and feeling just fine but there was this dread that the next thing might trigger me and I lose control. I feel weak and pathetic. Max from a few years ago would have spat on me. I'm pathetic, what is so difficult? It should be simple. When I'm in this state everyone around me is just so incredibly irritating. Nearly everything is irritating. Very quick to anger, normally I'm always calm. It's usually incredible hard to make me mad. 

Currently 10:45, I felt control slipping away but writing all this helped me regain myself. I very much fear slipping into that state. It doesn't feel like I'm the same person and I can't predict at all what I'm going to think or feel, possibly even do. At least that's one thing I have control over, my actions. When I'm in that state, the most I'll do on an external level is cry/over-eat. I still have control of what my body will do. So far it can only make me not want to do things. Jesus, look at me. I wonder if anyone reads this will they think I'm fucking insane, I should probably edit this so it doesn't make me seem like I'm bipolar or something. (If anyone is reading this. It's just a metaphor for how I rationalize my states of mind. I'm not crazy. Crazy people can't control themselves. No-one would ever suspect I was crazy because I can control myself) 

(If anyone does read this, keep in mind that I'm fully aware that this is all made up in my head. My life is very easy compared to many people which is why this perplexes me so much and is why it feels like a different person is in charge of my mind and emotions sometimes. Right now I couldn't imagine being sad, I'm fine. But randomly, I'll get in that state and lose all desire and motivation. I will literally not want a single thing and just hate life. It will feel like life is not worth it like why am I going through all this? For what? but I relate to those questions right now because I'm currently a normal person and cannot understand my mind in those states. It's like listening to another person's thoughts. I can merely remember that those thoughts occurred)",22Oct2018,1
63,"Hi! (didn't know where to post this sorry ahah)

I'm in a queue for a neuropsychological evaluation for autism or possibly something else. I've been in this queue for over 6 months now and finally it's time. They tell me I'll have to do a urine test to make sure Im not on any drugs before they can do the evaluation. No problem, I figured. I'm not on any type of drugs at the moment. 

I found out today I have to do a blood test as well. I guess I should have known that, but I didn't. I'm freaking out. It's this week. Even though I've been clean lately I did harder drugs a couple of times this summer and smoked weed pretty much every damn day. Not partying just by myself in my room lol I'm fucked right? I'm 19 so maybe my parents won't ever find out? But they have to interview my parents for the evaluation thing so maybe they will. I'm also worried that they might not wanna do the evaluation at all if they see I've done drugs? When they asked me I told them I didn't cause well I don't anymore. 

I have to to this evaluation to go to their therapy and my regular therapist is too expensive and I can't have a job because of my mental problems and they said they could help me out with that if I got diagnosed and I'll get help from school with I really need. What do I do? I know I sound probably really stupid but please understand I just suck at handling life and I always make bad decisions I'm really trying to do better.

65,"Hi all, this is a fairly long story, I know it's a lot to ask for someone to read all this. I won't judge you if you only skim-read it, you can absolutely reply with any thoughts you have.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Background.**

I'm a 22 years old male college student. I've never been to a psychologist or therapist and therefore I've never been diagnosed with anything.

I've always been a (hyper)active child. Before and after puberty, that didn't really change. Besides suffering from some social anxiety (diagnosed online, where I joined a 6-month long online therapy course offered by the psychology department of my university), I'm a healthy human being for the most part. Never took any medication or drugs (besides alcohol and weed from time to time in extreme moderation).

&amp;#x200B;

**My Behaviour.**

In public I can control myself for the most part, I barely talk to people (i don't have any friends at my university) and I really don't have any social interactions (besides from participating in class and group projects etc.). However, when I'm alone or with people who I'm comfortable being with (my friends - who are not at my uni and whom i don't really see all that often, or my family etc.) I'm really hyperactive. In any conversations I'm the loudest guy and usually talking the most, I have trouble restraining myself - I'm way too enthusiastic and that's really annoying for most people. If I'm not talking to anyone or if I'm alone, I usually talk to myself (out loud), have loud cringy outbursts and sometimes feel like I'm 10 years old and I just got a new bike for my birthday or something, for example when I discover a new song that I like or anything like that. It's really hard to describe and I constantly have this feeling of tension/pressure/stress in my stomach and it just won't go away. I fantasize - sometimes for an hour or two - about having lots of money and living a dream life or something, where I plan very detailed what I would buy, where I would go, what kind of stuff I'd do - while walking up and down in my room really fast and talking out loud. It's somehow a pleasant state, because I feel happy and energetic and somewhat motivated, but at the same time it's really annoying and exhausting and I don't think it's normal. I never see people being this hyperactive, all the people I know are totally normal, which in my eyes is boring and i ask myself ""how can this person be so boring?"". This is especially bad when I'm listening to music (I absolutely love Techno, and music overall has been the thing I love most throughout my whole life) - where I sometimes feel like I'm exploding out of euphoria, like I'm on MDMA or some other drug because of how good the song is. My brain just won't shut up, it goes on and on and on about this and that.

I'm having trouble reading stuff and sitting down and just relaxing but i don't think i have ADHD, since sometimes (rarely) if i really want and if i'm motivated I *can* sit down and work through a text for 2 hours for a class. This only works though if it's a necessary assignment which has a deadline or something like that.

In the evening I can't fall asleep, I'm turning around in my bed for hours and hours watching stuff on my phone or just thinking about life or talking to myself. I basically stay up really long and therefore can't get up before noon.

&amp;#x200B;

**On the other hand** there are sometimes stages in my life where I feel totally depressed and lifeless for days. I'm like a zombie, not really talking, not laughing, being sad, thinking about how sad my life is, being scared of the future - and realistically I've not achieved anything in life so far and i'm not sure where I'm going or where I want to be. I feel like time is running out and I'm just not moving forward so I sit in my room browsing youtube, twitch, forums or other stuff, not doing anything productive and feeling depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

It kind of sounds like bipolar disorder - but somehow it doesn't ""feel that way"". My hyperactive phases are not really manic and I can control myself if i have to (for example in public or when I'm not alone). At the same time my depression phase usually happens when something bad happened in life - like I got the flew or i didn't pass an exam or i got confronted with something bad about my life, which the again is not really depression, a lot of people behave like that, it just happens more often to me and sometimes there's not even a real reason for it. Like one day I just realized that I wanna be a music producer and not in college, but i realize this is a fairly unrealistic thought and then from one moment to the next my mood can just switch completely. Same when I'm out with friends, I'm super happy and excited and the next moment on I turn down, get silent and start to feel sad. They ask me ""what's wrong"" after a while and I can't even give an answer, it's just that my feeling suddenly changed form happy to sad.

&amp;#x200B;

**So basically,** what I want to know is if there is anyone who feels the same way? Maybe someone is experiencing the same thing and has been diagnosed with something? Or might it be kind of normal in my state of life, where I don't know where I'm heading, what I want, have no friends, no conventional routine or lifestyle etc.?

&amp;#x200B;

To some people this might sound not too bad - but I'm really not feeling normal and I don't like the way I behave, which is  why I'm making this post. I just want to get rid of this tension and stress in my gut, it feels like a knot in my stomach.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously only a doctor can diagnose me, but I really won't be going to a therapist. I'm way too embarrassed to do this and I wouldn't even know where to start or how that would work. I'm mainly looking for some kind of information or thoughts anyone else has about this.

66,"First few days I felt like I had taken too much cough suppressant-- dizzy, drowsy, generally foggy. No appetite. Exhausted. Couldn't stop yawning so big it made me gag. 

Yesterday most of that stopped, but today my upper body feels like I need to stretch-- no matter how much I stretch, the sensation stays. I know this is the medication because it stops about 12 hours after I take it, and only started again an hour after I took it this morning.

Luckily I haven't had any stomach issues or sleeping issues-- I guess for sleeping my narcolepsy outweighs the insomnia side effects.

I don't know why these things are really coming to the surface now instead of years ago when my trauma really happened, or why my anxiety is striking solely within the last few years rather than when my parents split up or when I was bullied in middle school. The problem now is that I cannot focus on simple assignments anymore, there are days when I am constantly on the verge of crying but also feeling apathetic, other days I am so spaced out and exhausted that I can hardly stay awake in my History courses (history major), and my sleep pattern has gone all to hell.

We instantly clicked and although it was scary, I had no qualms telling my parents (I’m a bisexual man who’d remained under he radar for the most part) I wanted to be with this guy because I was (and still am) certain that he is the person I will spend the rest of my life with.

On Saturday we were away for a friend’s and my other half’s birthday which we were both looking forward to. However I got too drunk and reverted to some very self destructive behaviour and self harming, which my other half had never witnessed before. I went from being chirpy and happy, to being horrible, manic, sad and out of control.

My other half now has extreme doubts about whether we should be together, he’s asked for space which I’m trying to give him, but ultimately I am absolutely terrified that we won’t be together anymore.

81," 

I’m not sure if this is the right place for this, but I suppose a phobia falls under the “mental health” umbrella. 

I’m not sure how to start this, other than the fact that I have a crippling phobia of bugs and there’s a cricket currently in my bathroom sink that has me sitting in the living room paranoid that it’s \~gonna get me.\~ I have to wait for my husband to get home from work to deal with it, and in the meantime I’ve been sitting here thinking, “what if it’s gone by then?” “what if it goes somewhere else?” “what if it’s right in front of the door?” The logical thing to do would be to kill the cricket, I know that. I know killing it would be the easiest way to put my fears to rest, but the idea of getting close enough to do so makes me feel physically sick, terrified that it’ll jump on me. 

Even once it’s dead, I’ll still think about it for...hours. Hours and hours. I’ll think about the cricket, wonder if there’s more somewhere, I’ll be scared to shower (which is why I was originally in the bathroom anyway) and then I’ll be scared to sleep. Whenever I see a bug, I “feel it” on my skin. I have to check my hair to make sure there’s none in it, I have to shake just in case it’s on my clothes, even if I’m staring directly at the bug I just imagine that there’s more and they’re on me. I get paranoid for hours, even after the bug is dead, I still feel itchy and even the feeling of my hair touching my face freaks me out because I think that it could be a bug. If I find a roach, I have to deep clean the apartment. I have to get every nook and cranny because I’m terrified that we’re “slobs” and now there's an infestation. Mind you, the only roaches that get in here are the giant “water roaches” or whatever they’re called, and logically I KNOW these ones aren’t the ones common in infestations but that paranoia is still there. 

This phobia is really starting to wear me down. I live in an apartment in a rather “bug filled” state, so it’s not that uncommon for water roaches, beetles, moths, spiders, and other things to get in. Not even that, seeing bugs outside even puts me into panic. Before we moved to a downstairs apartment, there was a dead roach on the stairs that went to our old apartment, and I stood outside for fifteen minutes at the bottom of the stairs (terrified that the roach was alive) calling my husband’s phone so he could move the bug. It’s pathetic. Even when the bug is dead I freak out. I feel like an idiot sitting on the couch waiting for my husband to get home. I need to shower, but I can’t because I’m scared. 

I’m not sure if this is relevant, but this isn’t a “random” phobia. When I was young, my sister would put grasshoppers and crickets in my hair or on/in my clothes. I honestly can’t say why it terrified me so much, but it did. She thought it was funny when I would cry about bugs being on me, so she kept doing it and now I just have this instant panic response to almost all bugs. My husband really wanted a tarantula or millipede as a pet, but the idea absolutely terrifies me and due to my fear he can’t have something he really wants. 

I already have really bad issues with depression right now, and this stupid cricket is ruining my day. A cricket. A fucking CRICKET is ruining my day. How do people get rid of their phobias? I know they probably never “truly” go away, I just want to be able to kill the bugs that get into my apartment without working myself into a panic attack. I find myself even scared to go outside on nice days because I *might* see a bug. It’s stupid, because this fear definitely influences how I live my life. ",22Oct2018,1

87,"I made a post earlier asking about this and everyone said that the doctor would have definitely written a diagnosis, even if they did not tell me what it was. 

I went and called the office to ask and they said that the doctor had not even finished completing the treatment plan that would have listed what my diagnosis is. And yet she prescribed a pretty heavy duty anti-psychotic without even telling me what it is for. I have had concerns about the way this place has been treating me and this sort of cements it. 

Asking about my medical records through HIPAA was difficult, they said that they cannot just release it to me for ""personal use"" and that my reasoning has to be approved by the medical records director. Is this correct? They said that they can only release it if it is to another doctor or a lawyer, but not just for myself. Is that a violation of my HIPAA rights?

91,"Dedicated to the memory of someone who will be unnamed out of respect.

&amp;#x200B;

My story starts not with myself, but a dear friend that sadly passed away due to suicide.

I didn't know her for long, but cared for her deeply. 

About two weeks after we started dating she had herself hospitalized for suicidal tendencies. She went to the hospital herself and stayed there for three days. Afterwards she did not feel better and she practically begged to be taken back into the system. She literally asked for help wherever she could.

Sadly for her, her family was not around at the time to help her, so she was dependent on me and the mental health facilities.

She was never readmitted and killed herself three days later.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this and some other reasons in my personal life I started having problems with depression and mental health myself. This has lead me to the point where I have ambulatory help at home and see a psychiatrist two times a week.

They all expressed major concern when they found out I knew how I wanted to end it all if it ever came to that. Keyword: IF. I told them they shouldn't worry about me that much and spend their time focusing on people who actually needed the help they could provide.

&amp;#x200B;

They did not listen.

&amp;#x200B;

Now every day someone from the psychiatrist's office comes to my home to check on me and make sure I am okay. Even though I have expressed great disdain towards them coming to my home they keep doing it.

This is making me angry past healthy levels.

How come they can take so much time 'helping' me when I clearly don't need such immediate help. I just need to be able to process my feelings and talk about it with someone, that's all.

Yet when they had someone in front of them that actually needed help they chose to ignore it with drastic consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why I'm even posting this or making it public, I hate talking about myself, especially about the bad stuff. I guess I just really needed to get it out and make the story heard.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who took the trouble of reading through all this, thank you for listening to my story. I hope others are getting the help they deserve and need.",22Oct2018,1

94,"This is going to be a horrifyingly long post. I'll start with the **least** concerning stuff. 

So, being suicidal always seemed be my default state. I spent a good few years like ""haha I'll just kill myself, none of this matters, fuck this stupid planet"", yadda yadda. Edgy shit. Acted up at school, did whatever, you know. Despite this, the closest I came was squirting some bleach on my tongue with a note. Sat at my window wanting to jump more than I can count.

Whatever, though! This is all somewhat average stuff. Plenty of suicidal people out there. Just...Bear with me.

So, last year - not sure when when - I stopped thinking about death. Actually began making plans for the future. I reconciled with an old friend (I think she may have been the cause of this desire to live?). She's pretty emotionally void (or wants to be), but we're very close. We have a lot in common. I genuinely care about her a lot. But because I'm an absolute freak, I get very upset if she seems mildly mad at me. Or even doesn't laugh hard enough at my jokes. Talks too much to another person. My personality changed a lot to match hers, too. 

I hide it well, though. Very well. She thinks I'm just as detached as her - and I am, in a lot of ways. We share a general distate for the world and I think we bonded over that a lot. Also a lack of empathy in some areas, too much in others. Can't forget our pretty sick sense of humour. I feel a very sick sense of joy when she falls out with her other friends, because it's just me she doesn't fall out with. When she talks to other people, I get sickeningly sad. I hate being like this more than anything else. in the world. Really makes me wish I could remove certain parts of my brain. 

Now, onto some stuff that subsided for a bit but had always been present before. I self harm. Cut, bruise, hit, burn, scratch, whatever. Some times I have absolutely 0 reason. Just wanna see it. Other times, it's out of guilt or embarrassment. Or stress. I'm sure you get the picture. The best part of this is I'm CONSTANTLY making jokes about these people and mocking the ones with visible cuts (not. to them, obviously. I'm not that much of a fucking asshole) and **my head doesn't even call me a hypocrite**. No one knows about this except my my mum, who found out by accident (God, that was awkward). 

Once again, pretty average ^^^

I also shoplift! Never been caught. Actully started doing this just a few months ago, but cutting down a bit recently. God knows why? Maybe because I'm kinda poor and want stuff. Maybe for fun. I'm not really sure. Yeah. Mostly clothes, makeup and shit I really don't need. Started this when I found out about the shoplifting community on Tumblr. So stupidly easy. I try to only take from massive corporations. 

Now, this is where I start to sound like an ACTUAL  fucking looney if I didn't yet. 

I have separate people in my head! Each with their own individual internal voices, facial expressions, voices, senses of humour, worldviews, appearances...You name it. I have about 5 consistent ones and some only stay for a few days/weeks. Some are stronger than others. This is not DID, because I'm still sort of...There? Like. Watching it all. No amnesia. I'm not sure if this is just me acting like how I want to be or something, but I talk to them in my head sometimes. They usually ""front"" for an hour at MAX.

To summarize my main ones: Ryan (gore addict with little empathy and little emotions, dry wit, lazy as shit, but actually a pretty chill fella who wants to be a good guy). Moog (fiction addict, can't stand the real world, doesn't do shit all but consume and make fiction. Yeah. Barely interacts with people). O (childish fuck who likes pissing people off and petty crimes, weirdly charming, kinda nice? Pretty suicidal. Once almost stabbed someone's eye out as joke. The person thought it was a funny prank or whatever, but I fucking didn't. I kinda hate O. Thinks he can't do shit wrong because he's just a product of his genetics. Once again, I kinda hate him! Go home). Then there's Sal. Haven't heard from in a while. Think he's dying. Absolute creep. Once again, I hate him. Obsessive, thinks the world is going to end soon, regularly thinks about stalking (not in an eat-your-organs way, but more a protective my-world-should-revolve-around-you and I want to kill anyone who harms you way). I

I also adopt the personalities of characters and public figures I like sometimes. Sometimes I know better - the people will be bad/miserable/etc - but that sure doesn't stop me. 

Finally, some honourable mentions of me being literally a fucking freak who should probably die:

- Had a weird habit since I was a child of just...spinning around, listening to music, and fantasizing about being in certain worlds I made in my head. Spend hours doing this. 
- Pick the skin from my fingers till they bleed by habit. 
- Stabbed myself and blamed it on another kid for little reason. She was telling me today how scared she used to be of me and how she didn't talk because of me. She was pretty jokey, but I still felt awful. I was about 11.
- Got a kid a permanent racism card for making the same racist jokes I was. Once again, about 11. 
- Got mad at my mom, left the house. Went up the street and got bored, but was too prideful to just come home. Instead faked that some guy tried to get me into my car and started sobbing and screaming. Sisters BF walked around the estate with a baseball bat while I described some guy who never existed. Again, around 11. 

My childhood was mildly fucked up, but I don't think enough to justify...All of this. 

TL;DR: suicidal, obsessive, 6 separate people, cynical, fucking sick, self harming, shoplifting, violent, maladaptive 15 Y/O girl. Really think the world would be kinda better without me. Would appreciate some insight as to what is wrong with me. Thanks in advance.

97,"Ever since I can remember, I've become ""obsessed"" with people. Not in a sexual way–it's not like I want to date them, be their girlfriend or anything. But I would long to get to know them and be their friend. Earlier in my life, these people were celebrities, or even fictional characters. I struggled to make friends with my peers, and though I love my own family, the feelings I felt towards these people were different somehow. Not necessarily stronger, but more intense, like I really NEEDED to be BFFs with them. Funnily enough, I've never actually had a ""crush"" on someone. I've loved and been obsessed with people, but never felt romantically or sexually attracted to anyone.

My latest two obsessions have actually been real, accessible people–two of my professors. I'm over one of them now, but I've gotten attached to my current one. I hardly know her, yet I feel this connection to her that I can't explain, and I wonder if this feeling is love. Again, I do want to emphasize that this is in no way an ""attraction"" thing, or wanting to marry them. It's almost like I want to be their kid, which is so weird, because it's not like I've ever had a shitty relationship with either of my parents. They've always loved and supported me, but for some reason I crave the attention of other adults that I get hooked on for whatever goddam reason. I'm not the typical college girl, jealous of my professor's spouse, I'm jealous of their kids. Thankfully, the professor I'm obsessed with now does not have any children with her partner, but I live in fear that she still might have a baby, even though I believe she's about 40. See how stupid and weird that sounds? I don't know what's wrong with me. 

I am mortally terrified that she might leave the school, or leave my life in some other way. Part of me knows, deep down, that this obsession, like all the others that have come before it, will pass, but there's another part that wonders if this one is really going to be ""the one."" That is, the obsession that truly sticks. I have no idea why I get this way with people. My obsessions don't even develop after I've actually gotten to know them, but the other way around, so it makes no sense that I would be so enamored with someone who is a stranger to me. Does anyone have an explanation for why I might be this way? Anyone else here experience similar feelings?",22Oct2018,1
98,"Hi, my name is Kat and i‘m posting here in the hope that someone can tell me if the pain and the problems i‘m experiencing are just normal teenager stuff or if i could have mental health problems.

I‘m 18 years old now and i‘ve been born intersex, i‘ve had surgeries and hormone treatments as a young child to be „male“ and was raised as a male. I‘m currently transitioning to female since about a year ago. That‘s kinda where things start..

I‘m experiencing a lot of dysphoria because of this.. i feel like i‘m living in the wrong body, i feel like a girl that was made into a „boy“ by surgeries. I wish i was a girl, or atleast in the state that i was born in. When i was around 16 i felt so pressured into „being a man“ that i attempted suicide. I came out as a girl one year later.

Now, i still present as male, and everyone still sees me as male more or less. It‘s a long journey i have to go. My body is luckily very very feminine for a „boy“ since my Testosterone levels are super low.

I still hate my body though. I spent countless time in front of the mirror, and i‘m incredibly fragile about my looks. I have to look into a mirror / selfie cam every 20 minutes to see if everything looks „right“ i‘m constantly touching my hair to adjust it, and sometimes when my looks dont reach a certain beauty standard i‘ve set for myself i get a breakdown and i feel like shit for the rest of the day. If someone says anything bad about my looks i‘m incredibly hurt and spent hours in front of the mirror to see if what they said is true. I also need constant reassurement that i don‘t look horrible. There are days where i feel good about my looks too though. I often get attention online for them, especially in the LGBT community and that can make me feel kinda good.

Another big problem of mine is lonelieness. I never really had a close person in my life, i‘ve never had a relationship, i‘ve never had close friends and kinda walked through my entire life alone. I really really need someone, but i‘ve got noone. No one to talk to, no one to vent to, nobody that can comfort me or take me into their arms or anything at all. And i‘ve never had anything like that. Anyways, I get lonelieness attacks where i just wanna cry, and i just wanna shout out for someone. I often curl up and hug a pillow and imagine there‘s somebody there. I wish for nothing more than a single person in my life that, and i feel so much pain cause i‘ve got nobody. 

I kinda have problems socializing, i always feel like i‘m odd or weird and i can‘t really connect with people my age in real life at all.

Another thing is anger attacks... when it all gets too much i get attacks, where i just go mental for like 5 minutes and literally smash stuff. I only have these in private, i can kinda controll them that far. My family knows though. I just need to let everything out once in a while. I often violently harm myself during these attacks, or afterwards.... I always feel like a complete piece of shit afterwards. 

I have phases where i self harm and phases where i don‘t. At the moment i do. I used to cut my wrists, but at the moment i‘ve switched to ramming needles in my skin, since i can even do that in class as long as its not deep enough that i start bleeding to much. I just kinda ramm them in and out quite fastly. It helps to relieve stress and pain.

The intensity of my pain and lonelieness also changes on a weekly basis. Sometimes i‘m doing fine sometimes i just wanna die. I have mood swings quite a lot, since very tiny things can bring me down very fast. 

I think about suicide a lot, but in more if a logical sense i guess. I‘m not very afraid of dying, i don‘t value my life that much anymore. But i‘m afraid i‘m to much of a pussy to actually kill myselfy. I think about it on a daily basis though. I’ve made quite detailed suicide plans. 


Well yeah, thats everything wrong with me i guess.. i don‘t know if i‘m just a stupid emo teenager or if thats something serious, so hearing opinions from you would help me a lot. Sorry this got into so much of a vent btw. ",22Oct2018,1

I feel like if there was a cause I could clearly remember I would be able to say, ""because of x I am this way."" But instead I just feel like all these things I am ashamed of are just character flaws:

I'm a weak loser who can't leave my apartment.

I have a selfish and lazy penchant for addiction to whatever is most convenient - food, drugs, sex, self harm, technology etc.

And most prevalent lately is my fucked up sexual stuff. I just can't get off on anything that's not pretty extreme. Rape, violence....I started typing other stuff but deleted it because I'm so ashamed. I don't want to have these thoughts and fantasies but they're just there.

I've worked so hard on getting better. I've been in treatment a handful of times. I've fallen and gotten up over and over and over again. I've been alone through almost all of this. My family is scared of me, my more casual friends get overwhelmed. I've only ever had one close friend and he died of a heroin overdose about 4 years ago. Yesterday was his birthday. 

As I'm getting older I'm losing my will to ""recover"". I'm just being dragged through this life by my body, which refuses to die. I'm starting to get a little scared because I always had a mental drive to get better and thrive but that light is fading a lot lately. It's been a long time that I've been fighting this.

I have never been able to develop empathy towards over or really develop a human connection to others. The best way to describe how I feel is being an alien watching over others as I try and make myself blend in. It's been years since I've tried and gotten very good at it. I've learned to project emotions and empathy towards others in order to gain friends but every relationship I have (platonic and romantic) seems fake and fabricated. My ability to manipulate others and be able to fit in with others has reached a point where I can appear normal. 

To reach the main point of this post is over the past year I've reached a point where I am afraid of reaching out to anyone without fear of being deemed a psychopath and institutionalized. I've started to day dream of what it would be like to hurt someone, not just hurting their feelings but torturing them and thinking of what I could do in order to take control and ruin someone's life, it's almost a fantasy. I don't want to do this and I can think myself out of this knowing hurting others is really, really fucked up but I scare myself as it feels as if there is another person living in my head which likes to take over and use my head for their thoughts. It's not another voice but instead it's a split version of me who enjoys this.

I write this today as earlier I go to a person's room who struggles with mental health issues and it felt like the other personality took over. It used everything it could to manipulate them, to play with them like a puppet and see what pain I could cause them. There was this sick enjoyment and pleasure over seeing them cry and in pain over them hurting themselves and tearing themselves apart and all I could think is how fun it would be to keep them going and see how I could lead them to choices which would only hurt them more for my enjoyment.

107,"Just to over simplify things. 


•I’ve been depressed for three years after leaving religion (possible religious trauma?)

•Lose of character, motives, goals and drive. I don’t know who or what I am.


•Ive been experiencing existential dread

•Confused by my own emotions, sometimes doubting them. (Example: I’ll be mad then doubt my anger and ask myself if it’s real anger or am I just acting? That really drives me crazy)

• I doubt my own sexuality and sometimes over think it. Sometimes I’d notice if a man looks good or not then feel anxious and afraid of actually being gay. This would then trigger some over thinking. When it started I would do tests where i would see how I would react to gay porn...yeah...it was bad. I’d sometimes reach a point where I’ll get really frustrated and think about stabbing my legs with a pen.

•I also doubt my emotions, especially love. I was in a relationship with a girl that went sour with time. The first week was okay, then I was afraid that she’ll fall in love with me, then I was asking myself why am I not falling in love? Am I being a hypocrite when I be nice? Am I fake laughing at her jokes? Sometimes I’d open her profile picture just to see how I feel. With time I fell in love with her and my doubts towards my own feelings became worse.

•Found myself screaming in the car out of frustration two or three times.

•Bursted into tears all of a sudden multiple times, and when I want to cry because I feel like crying. I don’t.

•Sudden feelings of high energy, where I feel like I can lift anything. Literally feel like a God. Then would feel down and tired. These episodes could last for hours or days sometimes even weeks.

•Bored 24/7 

•Issues with sleep, can’t sleep.

•Weird panic or anxiety attacks? Not sure? Last one was a really weird one where I felt like my hands were tiny and I was being folded from my head. I forgot about the others. Sometimes I get dizzy and feel like I’m in an adrenaline rush.

•Sudden realizations of reality, sometimes I’d look at my hands and they would look weird as if I saw them for the first time or this is some kind of VR game.

•I’ve been diagnosed with hypothyroidism 1 year in this 3 year issue. These things that I’ve mentioned don’t really go away with or without the thyroid medication.

I also have a sunrise alarm clock, but I didn't like it very much when I tried it out last year (to be fair, I really cheaped out. I wish I had purchased a nicer one.) I need to wake in natural light to be a functioning human and I'm bummed thinking about going without it for the next several gloomy months. 

Does anyone have any tips that have worked for them? I'm open to any and all suggestions!

Thank you!",22Oct2018,1
112,"I'm not sure where else to post this, so I've posted it here. 
Recently my mum discovered my instagram, where I enjoy posting pictures of myself. In some of them I'm wearing only a bra and undies, and she says she's disappointed about it. She said she's done everything to preserve my ""radiance"" and she expects me to have more ""self worth"".

I used to just accept that if someone dresses ""slutty"", they lack dignity and self worth as well, but now that I've thought about it, I don't know WHY exposing more skin or wearing tight clothing lowers self worth. I am genuinely wondering why my mum is so disappointed (I'm too scared to ask her so I thought I'd ask y'all why you think people might think this way). 

Thank you!! ",22Oct2018,1
113,"As kids, we were naive to the world, and our parents were meant to guide us. Through their helping hand, they are meant to show us the ups and down of this world, and through their guidance we should be able to find ourselves and learn to prosper. That is, unless the guidance is akin to an electric fence in a prison, which traps a child into a mentality that everything the parent wants is the absolute truth. Dare step outside the bounds, and you are electrocuted by damaging words like ""Don't be stupid, do that and everyone will hate you"" or after a divorce, ""Your mom knows nothing and I know everything, don't question my authority"".

And as a kid, even though it hurts, you can listen. You can be an obedient child and obey, but the issue with that is you aren't being a good child out of your own free will. You aren't seeking to be obedient because you want to--the fence is still there and you literally have no choice.

This carries out into adulthood, and suddenly that ability to obey so well to authority is your absolute downfall, because you weren't taught to think for yourself. How could you, when you were conditioned into believing doing anything else would result in pain? It took me so long to understand this and acknowledge this fact--but it's not all grim.

Because it wasn't me who was at fault--it wasn't me who sought to control everything around me, me who was set in my ways and it most certainly wasn't me who had done anything wrong. It was just that voice in my father's head, that beckoned him to control everything around him--to the point where if anything I do is against his wishes, even the breaths that come out of my mouth--he will retaliate. I realized that who I am is a result of that conditioning, and as an adult, I should take the next step forward to do what I know what is best for myself. Look at myself and acknowledge the good I've done as well as the negative, and balance out my life.

I was a victim to emotional abuse--but I don't have to dwell on that. I don't have to let it define me. Simply acknowledging what I've gone through, but not letting it chain me down like it once had, is what has helped me propel myself forward. Because I deserve love--and it's just a shame that abusive conditioning can make this so hard for individuals to acknowledge.

114,"My dad, 57, had started to become increasingly delusional and angry and I don’t know what to do. He is obsessed over the idea that my mom, his wife for over 30 years, is cheating on him. She works and commutes an hour a day while he has been unemployed for over five years. Most days he confronts my mom or is in a terrible mood and everyone is scared to approach him. He has started to just leave all day and say that he is going to the library but I’m not sure that’s what he is doing. He is angry and obsessed with the delusion my mom is cheating on him despite constant reassurance. He went to a psychiatrist last week but concealed what was actually going on with him and did not receive a diagnosis or a follow up appointment. It is destroying my family and has been going on for two months. My mom is scared for her safety. I don’t know what to do. ",22Oct2018,1
115,"Not sure if this is a thing or not, but hey-ho.

Hey Reddit. I just joined to day cause I figured I could ask the trusty people of the internet on how to get things done. So basically I'm really tired of life. Now I know anyone reading this is probably thinkin' I'm being dramatic and all, but I don't really like it. From what I've heard and seen; you go to school, you go to college to get a degree or whatever, you get a job, you pay tax, you keep working for the next 50 years, you worry about pensions and then you die. Not exactly what I'm looking forward to.

Now, I ain't and edgy guy as such and I have it pretty easy since I don't have a job and just go to college or sit at home. But I don't know what to do with my life now. I don't like what I' doing in college and I don't know what else I could be doing. And each day of what I'm doing now just makes me more tired

So I got thinking, 'What if I just suicide like an edgy kid?', but I don't really like the idea of dying with pain as the last thing in my mind. I want to just fall asleep and not wake up. No fuss or nothin' like that - nice and easy.

&amp;#x200B;

So Reddit. I've googled around and cased out the internet and found nothin' useful. What do I do to fall asleep and not wake up. I don't want anything that might not work or anything that will hurt, just an easy way out. And I DON'T want no treatment. I just want out.",22Oct2018,1

I'm 26 years old and have a partner, we are both happy and live together. Some days I'm really down and others im fine. The main worry for me is some days i dont want to go to sleep. I wake up and just want to stay there and not go to work. I thought it was my job causing this, but I've changed jobs and still have this issue. It comes and goes, sometimes im fine for a month then it starts. 

Am i just lazy? If you want to know anything else, please ask. 

Thanks a ton",22Oct2018,1

124,"I know I shouldn’t be self diagnosing and jumping to conclusions but something isn’t right. I haven’t been well for nearly two years now and after serious research I “believe” , with strong emphasis on the word, that I am suffering with BPD or at least BPD like symptoms. For a long time I assumed it was anxiety/depression but it feels like there is more to it, I have many traits or symptoms that aren’t mentioned within anxiety/depression. The closest I have found and the one that explains how I am feeling so accurately is BPD.

Now, my question is... can I go to my doctors and tell them I “believe” I am experiencing BPD like symptoms? I find it so hard to describe exactly what is going on in my mind and feel like that would be the easiest thing to say but I also don’t want to stir them in the wrong direction when I might have something completely different. Just throwing one mental illness in their face might steer them in the wrong direction, I don’t know...

This has been happening every month for a long time and I’m just now figuring it out. I forget in the moment that it could just be hormones because I’m stuck in my head. It could probably help me if I actually tracked my period too. It’s incredibly terrifying because I’m very spontaneous when it comes to self destructive behaviors. I never have “plans”, I just do it. 

So, guys and girls that have menstrual cycles, try to rationalize thoughts and see if it’s linked to your hormones. The moment passes and you will feel better, I promise. You can get through this, just like I have.",22Oct2018,1
126,"Hi everyone,  


TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) absolutely saved my life from a horrid, debilitating depression. I've become a massive evangelist for it: it's twice as effective as antidepressant medication by just about every measure: response, remission and relapse prevention. It's a revolutionary depression treatment that should be getting more attention. 

I started a website to help promote TMS and help other patients going through it: [www.kickdepressionsass.com](https://www.kickdepressionsass.com) . There's also some ""DIY"" stuff on there for habits and methods to manage depression, such as meditation and sleep hygiene.

128,"I’ve struggled with something for years, now. I seem to have gotten better with it, with regard to reducing the situations it happens in. I do seem to have more good days than bad days. So, here’s my deal.


Sometimes if I’m watching a TV Show (Professional Wrestling matches being the worst cases for me) or playing a video game, I start and watch/play. Then I’ll feel like I missed something or didn’t pay my full attention to it (regardless of whether I was or not) and start over or rewind. Then it happens again, and again, and again and then I have pretty much rendered myself incapable of finishing unless I take a break (which can last until the next day) from what I’m doing. What is this called? Is it perfectionism? I used to have this more severely as a little kid where I had trouble entering rooms due to this.",22Oct2018,1

The interesting this is that today I had a realization that when I am sleep deprived (like running on 4 or 5 hours of sleep) my symptoms go away and I feel completely back to my senses like before the trauma. I can also achieve this feeling when I use marijuana but I'm not really a fan so I don't really...
