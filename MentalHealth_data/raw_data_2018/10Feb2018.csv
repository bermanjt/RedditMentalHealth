0,"I have a mental health assessment on Monday to get a diagnosis. Just looking for a little help. 

Earlier today I heard my friend mouth something to my other friend while I was turned around, then when he tried to get her to say it louder because he must not have heard her, she whispered, ""he's listening,"" because she didn't want me to hear. But I did. I called them out but they kept telling me they were talking about the sheet that got thrown off of their bed. 

I was really angry and I started shaking and talking really fast, my heart was beating a million miles an hour. I went to my room to calm down and I kept hearing a loud ringing in my ear that would go away if I covered my ears hard and then it would come back, slowly getting louder. I felt like my legs and fingers were growing, I looked at them and saw them growing. My walls were stretching and had lines in them, I was frozen and shaking, laying in bed. My whole body was numb. I threatened my friend, I told him that if I ever found absolute proof that he's been lying to me and has been shit talking me for months under his breath that I would kill him. 

It lasted for around an hour but I still feel weird. Help? 

Edit: to include as much info as possible, I was also having racing thoughts about everything going on, and every time I calmed myself down a little bit I would just immediately go back into it if I had one thought that led to it. A small part of Poison in my Pocket from A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder kept playing over and over in my head.",10Feb2018,7

5,"This happens three or four times every night (for 3 days). As I wake up I can still hear this terrible sounds and it's scaring the sh1t out of me. But what's really scares me is the fact that this is all in my head. My girlfriend is scared by my reaction and me too. It's not only the noises I can hear; I can even feel the ground shaking. It's like a nightmare following me into real life... It's happening only for a few seconds but I'm really  worried about it.

Edit: I forgot, also there's always a big adrenaline push if this happens. Not sure if multiple adrenaline pushs at night are healthy.",10Feb2018,1
6,"I have trouble falling asleep at night and normally will fall asleep only around 4am. 
The other thing is that I have periods when I'm moderately happy and I'll have periods when I cry before falling asleep for no reason. 

It feels like a very short panic attack complete with hyperventilation. I used to have panic attacks but that was over 4 years ago and they were related to some thought spiral that caused it. Now all I think while crying is ""Why can't I stop? Why is this happening? I don't know what's going on"".

Other than this I don't have any common signs of anxiety or depression, I'm not really stressed. I've moved out about half a year ago to study in a different city but I'm more than used to living there now. My coursework is easy enough that I'm chill about everything. My long distance SO isn't a problem either. 

I'm just really confused",10Feb2018,5
7,"I haven't really said anything about it to either my counselor or psychiatrist, but I get these weird episodes of bizarre thinking and not feeling real. I've had them for a while but they've gotten worse through 2017 to now. They're not really bad but everything around me starts to feel really intense for a little while, I wouldn't call it dissociation because I feel hyper-aware of everything and extremely on edge. I have to focus incredibly hard to type during these moments and start to get really bizarre thoughts. I don't necessarily believe them but I get thoughts such as there's a beetle in my veins or I'm going to vomit a plant out of me or something. I'm aware they're just weird thoughts but I get really weird. I very occasionally hallucinate (usually visual but I have had auditory before). I have avoidant personality disorder so it makes it extremely hard to tell my psychiatrist things about this because I'm embarrassed. What should I do?",10Feb2018,1
10,"I have to do almost everything a certain amount of times and it's very hard to deal with, I haven't had therapy for OCD since 2013 and I have a bad memory so I can't remember all the helpful hints I was given.

11,"I was just walking by these people who were loudly talking and I hear “yeah like so-and-so is crazy, they are probably schizophrenic or bipolar like they’re psycho. They’re probably gonna end up on the news for murdering someone or something. And I can say that because I’m going into the mental health field”

It was just some 18ish year old kid but still. It made me so angry to hear someone being so blatantly ignorant and stereotyping people like that. It doesn’t help with the stigma. And when that guy said all of that, his group of friends around him started laughing about the “crazy person” they were talking about and they were all making fun of them. I don’t even know those people or who they’re talking about, but it still hurt me to hear it

12,"I'm a 21 year old male, with a stable office job and a *decent* family that doesn't cause too much stress or issues when I'm at home. But socially, I'm incredibly isolated. My close friends are just a few people who I might see once a month, and other than that it's work colleagues or fellow uni students. I can talk to someone if they engage with me, but let's just say I never 'pursue' a relationship/friendship.

And the thing is, I'm so happy like that. I could spend days just on my own completely happy, and if someone does chat with me and be incredibly nice I'll be grateful and engage, but I will almost never get back to them to develop a friendship. The weird thing is, I'm totally ok with this and I'm always described as the person who is contagiously happy and smiling. I know it's not normal, and my brother borderline bullies me about never going out on the weekends (with friends, I do my own things though like run a small business etc.) but it's as if this is 'how I'm wired'. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, I probably have some form of social disorder (sorry if that's not the right word) but if I'm happy does it really matter? I travel solo, work on personal projects and enjoy starting businesses - but I do it all without friends and whoever has been close, I'm normally the one who stops contacting them or forgets to/loses interest. Not out of annoyance, hatred but some other reason I can't quite figure out. If I wasn't happy, I'd head to a counsellor and maybe I still should, I'd just like to hear some other opinions if anyone could offer some advice. What brought me hear is my brother going on and on about it, and me knowing that it isn't normal and would usually make other people unhappy, depressed and feel lonely. But for me it's the opposite, and I want to find out why. Thanks!",10Feb2018,1

17,"Hi, so I’ve been having issues with my emotional health. For as long as I can remember, there has been a void inside me. Sometimes this makes me numb, sometimes sad, sometimes extremely anxious. Sometimes there is seemingly no reason for me to feel like I don’t deserve to shower for a week, but sometimes I try to ask myself questions. When I attempt to rationalize my thoughts, I usually find myself wishing for affection (not necessarily romantic). My mom isn’t a hugger and my dad (also not a hugger) moved out when I was super young. Sometimes it seems that is the root of my longing for affection, but sometimes I’m just generally down. There are days I have so much trouble getting out of bed to the point of my mother having to yell at me (usually on non-school days). There are stretches of time where it feels I just have a weight on my chest. And it’s gotten to the point where my closest friend who I love dearly is upset and maybe even annoyed by how I feel.. I know that sounds wrong but he just says there’s no reason for me to feel the way I do and I need to find a way to help myself. And there are times when I think I’m getting better, but I’m not. And before anyone asks, I am seeing a therapist, but he’s done nothing in terms of diagnosis/referral to a psychiatrist. The fact that he appears to think I don’t have a diagnosable issue makes me hate myself even more for feeling like my problems are as big as I feel they are. I know I have people in my life who love me, but I can’t feel it.. I haven’t been able to feel it for a very long time. And I know that sounds so ignorant and disgusting, and trust me, that only frustrates me more.

20,"It's taken me awhile to admit this to myself, but it seems that ever since I've had feelings for someone I've gone from passively or rarely suicidal, to actively or frequently suicidal. It's all tied back to the feeling of limerence and just wanting mutual feelings. The first time I had so much pent up affection with nobody to give it to, and it just manifested into frustration and emotional anguish after I became obsessed with my feelings. It was the first time I felt anything that *much*, like I physically and emotionally never felt anything so potent. The second time I hadn't fully moved on from the first, and it blew up in my face and left me worse off than before.    
  
I was never able to process either situation and it just cycles constantly to where I feel like I'm reliving it every couple months and I'm just re experiencing RSD over and over until I break. Get drunk, high, cut, anything. I can't deal with watching people in relationships, people talking about their relationships, it just pushes me back into the cycle. I really hate to say that I feel actively suicidal any time I've had genuine feelings for someone, and I've ended up fucked over in some way, lied to, patronized. It's killing me. Now I feel desperate, but I don't connect with people anymore and I am paranoid of everyone's intentions.   
  
I really cannot help that I've gotten hyperfixated on one, attached to another, never able to heal from either, I'm trapped, I cannot heal.

21,"The best way I can describe it is feeling like I'm in a fog, like I'm operating at maybe 75% of where my mind should be. 

In conversations its like I'm only partially there. When asked thought provoking or personal questions, I can give the proper response, but they rarely have any emotion or passion to back them up. It almost feels like I'm reciting from a textbook instead of speaking from the heart.

During my 8 hours of work every day, I can barely remember what actually occupied my mind. Its all one big blur that comes and goes. Most of the time it seems like I'm on autopilot all day.

I've recently realized that even though I've lived in the same house for 20 years, I couldn't tell you the most basic details in the neighborhood like street names and buildings that I have passed by almost every day. And here is where I have made progress. I have tried to be a bit more conscience and actually memorize my environment, like make note of the color of certain buildings, how many plants or windows do they have out front and things like that. I don't know how useful that is though.

I don't often get very angry, but on the flip side, rarely am I ever actually happy. The most positive I would say I am is just content.

I have got a lot of things that I would like to accomplish in life, that I have a purpose to fulfill, but I am finding it incredibly hard to make it my own. I spend a lot of time with people who are actually pursuing their dreams. You can actually see and hear their passion when they talk about it. That's not something I really feel though.

I get there is a lack of motivation and that I am complacent. But if I am unable to actually break through the ""fog"" and have some sort of burning desire tied to my goals, I don't see how I can actually pursue them.

Very rarely I'll break out of this funk. I'll be extremely passionate about life, and want to change a lot of stuff that I need to do better. It always happens quite abruptly, like right now, and usually happens at terrible times like 3 in the morning, but it barely lasts for more than 15 minutes. In those 15 minutes though, I would say I actually feel alive inside, and that is the state that I am trying to get to.

As I was typing this, I realize I very well might just be psyching myself out and creating a placebo effect. But this is something that I have been struggling with for a few years now, and I want to break away from it.

Any answers will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",10Feb2018,6
22,"I was diagnosed with depression at age 11, anxiety about a year after that. I've been comfortable with my diagnoses since then, but no medication I've been on has ever worked for me. My dad was adopted, but when he got his DNA tested and found his birth parents, we discovered that bipolar runs on his side of the family. I know that I'm posting to Reddit and not bringing this up with a professional, but I'm unable to go see someone at the moment and want other opinions or clarification so I know what to discuss when I'm able to find someone to talk to.

My range of function is higher than others'. I need to be happy, otherwise I start to drop into a depressive period really quickly. I feel like my happy periods are manic, though I don't know if I have bipolar, to the point that I'm productive until I can barely move. Shopping is also a problem for me, though I overspend both when I'm feeling manic and when I'm feeling depressed. I once went through a webMD list of bipolar symptoms and felt like I matched most of them. Mood swings, extreme highs and lows, apathy, irritability, risky behaviors, lack of concentration, frenzied speaking, all of that.

I've spent my life writing off symptoms and behaviors as just who I am outside of my mental illness, but I think if I can get to the root of my problem that I can start to treat these bad behaviors in addition to my mental health. I think it might be bipolar, maybe bipolar II. I think both my depression and my anxiety could fall under this general umbrella, but because all of these disorders are so closely linked I don't know how to distinguish between them.

Would someone be able to point me in the right direction as far as where to start figuring out what I have? Any symptoms to look for or questions to consider? I'm going to try to see a therapist as soon as I can, but there are a lot of unrelated reasons why going to a medical professional isn't in the cards for me right now.",10Feb2018,3

24,"Hello, I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this. But someone very close to me has become very different. Thinking back to it, I think it happened after their divorce. 

She used to be very cheerful, intelligent, and sweet. She put up with her cheating, lying, good for nothing husband for years. He even threatened to send her, and her children back to her country, if she didn't leave him alone (Going out and sleeping with other women). She stayed with him because of that. 

I never knew this when it was happening, because she faked it so well. Due to the years of stress this man has out her through, she began to become more outgoing. She started going out a bit more to cool off. She never cheated or anything like that. 

During this time, she began claiming that someone was watching her.

She kept saying ""they"" were sending her messages through the TV, radio, movies. She said the celebrities were toying with her, telling her that if she didn't listen, bad things would happen. 

She claimed she even had bomb threats sent to her via television. 

I, of course didn't believe her. I believed she was going crazy. Until things started happening. 

She asked her Supervisor for some time off, to finish the divorce, and get settled. But the supervisor refused, and put her on a private medical leave. She was out of work, and still stressed from the divorce. 

When she reapplied through the company, they bounced her calls and started ignoring her.

She kept things to herself, and never told anyone her plans. But whenever I accompanied her somewhere (Walmart, Food lion, bank, etc), I noticed people glancing at her, and hearing things about her. 

I'm not sure if it's paranoia on my part, or if what she's saying is actually true. 

There were times when I knew she was going out to do something, like buy milk, or shampoo. I don't know how I knew these things, I might be heard it from somewhere. 

And I also noticed that whenever she talks to people, they slip up and mention something they should most definitely NOT know. And they try to cover it up, and blame her of misunderstanding, because of a language barrier. Even though she can speak English very fluently. 

Am I going crazy? Or is there something really fishy going on? Are these symptoms for anything?",10Feb2018,2
26,"TL;DR - My tough family upbringing has made me a very emotionally repressed, damaged, private, almost reclusive person who has difficulty forming meaningful relationships. It has resulted in depression, anxiety and a broken self-esteem. How do I move on and heal from this?

Hello. This is my first time posting on here. This is not the account I normally use for reddit, I think it would be a good idea to have a separate account for my mental health.

I am a sufferer of depression, anxiety and show some symptoms of OCD. Recently, I've been thinking what has been the root of my problems and I think I have found the answer: I've realised I have come from a fairly dysfunctional family. I do not have it as bad as others, but I've been beaten by my dad before with a belt (hasn't happened for years though, probably because he is older and I'll be able to defend myself), as well as seen my siblings get hurt by him as well (again, it has not happened in years). My dad is /was also verbally and emotionally abusive; I remember him calling me a d***head when I was twelve (I am seventeen now) and the toll that took on my self-esteem, and he is constantly accusing my sister of being dumb (something that still goes on today). 

The worst part was, almost two years ago, my dad forced my sister and I to attend a Christian born-again service, because my older brother revealed to my dad that he was gay. It was the worst period of my life, being forced to believe in something I didn't want to (I am a non-believer). Though my dad and brother have reconciled since then and my dad no longer forces us to attend those services, I still remember how hopeless and suicidal I felt during that time, and I think that experience largely contributes to my depression and anxiety today.

I also feel my parents show favouritism over my brother than my sister and I. Even after his revelation, I feel like they love him more, as they talk to him more (even when he is living overseas now) than me. Also, when my brother was my age, my dad talked to him like an adult, however, for me he still talks to me like I am eight... and I'm almost legally an adult. I always find myself trying to seek my dad's approval and respect, and I hate that about myself.

Now all this dysfunction (if that is what it is) has had a serious toll on me. I feel guilty a lot of the time, as well as depressed, worried, lonely... I have trouble opening up to others too because I am afraid of getting hurt. I actually go to a psychologist currently, but we mainly talk about coping mechanisms for depression, anxiety and OCD. I have yet to open up about these thoughts about my family because they are not only recent revelations, but also because I', afraid she will tell my mother, who accompanies to her office.

I'm worried that I will never fully heal from these scars, and that I will be a miserable person when I grow older, like my dad. I'm afraid that I have kids, I will be cruel to them too, and I will just repeat the cycle. I'm afraid that I will never be able to fully open myself to anyone and have an intimate relationship.

How do I recover from this upbringing, now that I am close to becoming an adult? Should I tell my psychologist what I am feeling? Should I cut my family from my life as an adult (that thought is very tempting,  but how do I do it)?

To anyone who read the whole thing, I appreciate that immensely. If you want a summarised version, there is a one at the top of the post.

This is really putting a damper on my relationships. How am I supposed to connect with people when I barely say a word? I am this way with everyone, even family members I am close with. I desperately want to improve on this but I don't know how. What could even be causing this? I feel like there's something wrong with my brain, this isn't normal.

To top it all off, the mental health professionals I've told about this issue don't believe me because I can talk to them. Well of course I can, I've been to therapy for years and I know how it works, I tell you about my problems and you give me advice. There's a distinct pattern there. It's not like that with people in the real world. You don't complain to them about your deepest fears and mental health problems, you have to say things that are fun and interesting and topical. I don't know how to get them to understand how much I struggle with talking. If they saw me outside their office they wouldn't think I'm the same person.",10Feb2018,12
49,"I got arrested and cutting in jail kinda makes shit worse, but since I got out I've really been wanting to cut more. I'm not depressed, and I don't want to kill myself. I just like it. Is this normal? Should i just keep cutting or should I be in a psych ward or something",10Feb2018,2
51,"I’m currently awaiting evaluation for bipolar disorder and I sent my mother the song Evelyn Evelyn by Amanda Palmer to better explain my emotions to her. (https://youtu.be/zkXC5BF-nGo)

Does anyone else express their emotions via music?",10Feb2018,1
52,"Do you think that you can be addicted to self help books/media? 

I've read a ton of self help material within the past few years, and I honestly feel like it's made me more upset. ",10Feb2018,2
53,"My life has been pretty chaotic lately, and I’m not gonna get into all of it, but sometimes I just want to stay home and lay down. I get sad, and sometimes there’s not a reason for it. When I get like this, which is pretty often, I don’t want to do anything. I just want to be home. This means blowing off my friends when they want to hangout, and I’ve done it a few times. Not too often, though. 

But, I feel bad. What should I do? ",10Feb2018,3

55,"I can't figure out what I'm doing. I'm at college and I hate my major, my class and have no friends. I want to play music and work but I keep going through school miserable. I don't have any money and I can't support myself if I don't go to school and I just feel like a complete failure. I have depression and just started getting medicated at the end of December. Nothing in my future seems worth it. I just want to know what the hell I'm going to do. I don't know sorry for the ramble. But I guess I wonder what I should do. Everyone in my life makes me feel like i need to go through college but I don't know the answers and I just don't know. Anyone else feel like this? Anyone been at a simialr place in life and got out? How did you do it? ",10Feb2018,1
56,"When someone would say something bad about someone, I would feel bad as if they were talking about me.  I don't think it was genuine concern for the person they were talking about, more low self-esteem. Would that be accurate?",10Feb2018,1
57,"I’ve been with the most beautiful woman in the world for half a year this Valentine’s Day. We’ve done lots of things in this short time we’ve spent together, and I was planning on proposing to her on Valentine’s Day. Sadly that won’t happen though, last night we went to a small gathering of friends played cards and watched a movie. I smoked a little weed and she drunk some white rum I wanted her to stop but she said she was fine, and to my stupidity I forgot she had taken her percasets and anti depressants she was prescribed after she miscarried our baby a few weeks ago. So this all together made her black out and she went rampant when we got to our house and said she hated herself and at one point escaped to the kitchen and cut her arm. So me and her grandma who she lives with called an EMT and they brought her to the mental health section of the hospital, now that she is sobered up she barely remembers it and told me she never really has suicidal thoughts, just mild depression like lots of people have. Ifeel like a piece of shit for letting her do this already and now they’re taking her to a facility and she’ll remain there through Valentine’s Day. I’ve been at the hospital all morning and can see her for 10 minutes every hour but once she is at the facility I cannot see her for god knows how long. She told me she’s gonna miss me and started balling which caused me to cry too. I love this girl and the thought of not being able to text her or talk to her that long kills me and I just seem helpless.

Edit: sorry I’m new to this so sorry for any bad grammar I’m typing this while at the hospital",10Feb2018,1
