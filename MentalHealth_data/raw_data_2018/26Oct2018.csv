0,"I’m currently in the midst of trying to find someone *yet again* but am running into a strange problem.. I have a PPO health insurance plan, and 98% of the mental health providers I have contacted claim “we don’t accept insurance.” After talking to my health insurance provider, they said that this is *NOT* considered “out of network,” but rather *not insured whatsoever.* To my provider, getting mental health care is the same as buying a cheeseburger, and they won’t cover a dime.

The problem is that I’m not seeing anyone charging less than $250 per 1 hour session in my area. I can’t afford that. I also don’t know if I can afford, emotionally and physically, living like this much longer. I recently had a shingles outbreak which was a bit of a wake up call. 

Is this standard in the US? Anyone else have experience dealing with this?

(In the past I had an HMO insurance plan, mental health was covered for in-network physicians. The problem was they could only see me for 15 minutes every 2 months. This is in the SF Bay Area)",26Oct2018,1

2,"I (24F) need to get help for my boyfriend (36M). He called me yesterday and threatened to jump off a bridge. This is reoccurring behavior. I have reason to believe he is severely depressed and probably has anxiety. He struggles *daily* with suicidal thoughts. I feel like its getting worse lately. I have noticed him with teary eyes over the past week and he just wont open up to me about what's wrong. He drinks every single day, he smokes 1-2 packs per day depending on his stress. He often skips meals, never exercises, he is underweight, his hair is severely matted, does not brush his teeth. He constantly talks about killing himself. I feel helpless. This is my baby and I'm really scared for him. 

&amp;#x200B;

He refuses to go to a doctor. I don't know if he is afraid of doctors, but he will not go. Has not been to a doctor for years. I have heard of doctors on demand and I think I will try to get him to use that. Where do I begin? He won't do this for himself so I need to know how to start. How do I get him to therapy if he refuses to see a doctor? How do I get medication for him if he refuses to talk to a doctor? I am in Maryland, US if that's helpful.",26Oct2018,1
3,"July, 29th, night- I'm unstable, been for several weeks straight. Insomnia is back at it again, yet I wake up early. I sleep/stay in the bed at 4 am but I can't sleep because I'm uncomfortable and paranoid. I keep hearing noises outside my window. I know that they're talking. I'm worried about the real Sok, she is working by herself and at home alone. The social worker is b*tching about taking me out of my dorm of the building to the main part. I'm scared. I hear footsteps.

July, 30th, day- I'm starting to relapse, thinking about that multi blade, nice, sharp, and clean, on my thighs and stomach. I'm going to try to not do it. I don't want the body to fight whatever the f*ck is on the blade again. No socialization for two months right now, I think all the others were negative. Soon I'll have to deal with everybody again.

 Seriously can't you give a dying person a break. I can't even do some of the things I'm supposed to do to survive. The b*tch always gets moody when she's supposed to ''help'' me. My hair is thin and patchy, It'll get worse when that time comes, I'll feel like a living breathing sh*t.

July, 31st- The weird cartilage bump in my inner lobe is still hard and falling off. I have no idea of was has happened to my ear and why it's still there. I have a deep longing to strangle and torture the b*tch. She is overall a disgusting example of an human being. Antler's body has maggots and botflies all over his backside and in the sock. I didn't check Flea for a while.

September, 1st- Sok is acting strangely during are visit. She looks like utter sh*t. Mika stayed at the house today. I'm tired. 

Drugged up- I need to see my stomach, I have too much fat. I feel bad, but if I look great like two weeks ago. I'll show you a beautiful stomach. I don't show you it because I'm dysmorphic, and I need to hide the disgusting lumps of flesh of hideous tissue and useless milkducts or I'll feel like sh*t, would you like to see my stomach now Mika?

    Cullombo is emerging.

September, 3rd- One of the staff called out to me saying ''F*cking kill yourself dog sh*t!'' I don't know if I imagined it or if it was real. Anyways I feel really down and borderline wanting to just end it all. I miss Mika, he's really the only one that I have after Sok died. I think it really hurts him for me saying that Sok is real at times.

September, 5th- In between my chest I have circular dots. I had them noticeably after anorexia. I don't like them in the slightest, they don't look healthy. It's all too much for me. And to accept that this will never change. I need to get put on a different anti psychotic, but they make you so tired, sleepy and numb, and don't fix your brain. I saw Bratt trying to jump off a tall building while Axxel tried to stop them.

It's all too much- too much. I can't sleep and I'm dysmorphic again, paranoid again, in my own world, I hear them, I feel them, I'm going crazy. Sok is getting a bit better but Mika has gotten worse, I expect him to die at any moment. He's overworked and ill. He's dying, he's different, more melancholy. I just really want someone to love me. That's what I ever wanted since I was a child. Antler gave me an excuse and gave me company. I'm in my world yet still in this bucket of pain that I have since I was four. I'm dying 'young'. I don't want to bleed, it only makes me more suicidal and that it will make me be in an episode for most of my time here. I just don't want to bleed.

September, 7th- I had cut my thighs tonight. I'm so messed up. I didn't even feel arousal, the idea of it all makes me feel melancholy. For some reason I might feel pleasure or anything. Except I start producing pre. All at once, I'm losing again.

Poem-

    Come and sway
 
    Sway with me

    Give with me

    Give the pain to me, so I could throw it out and about down a 
    rabbit hole of hysteria and pain.

    Come to me and,

    Save me,

    Help me,

    Feed me,

    and I won't die.

    Not if you don't try.

    Because I'll throw it up in the air and scream.

4,"{I am a fifteen year old female with no diagnosed mental illnesses or conditions}

  Recently, I found myself becoming ""numb"" to both mine and other's emotions. I no longer feel sympathy or am empathetic. I also don't really feel love (toward others nor feeling loved) or feel like I care about others, however i know I do. This part is hard to explain. I know that I do love and care about my family and friends but I do not feel it within me, sort of like it's a fact I have learned that I love and care for some people. I also don't worry about loved ones how I used to, even when I know they may be in danger (ex. my best friend was considering running away from his home due to family issues and his identity not being accepted/abuse and even knowing the danger that would put him in being younger and female presenting, I did not try to stop him nor did I feel worried for him even though I tried to bring myself to feel worried for him). Whenever I feel any strong emotions, it feels like the equivalent of listening to music over a really static-y radio station. I know the emotions are there but I can't identify them or fully feel them. My suicidal thoughts have also been getting awful. They are now more strong and graphic and happen more frequently and randomly, like in the middle of a conversation or something. I am more emotionally invested in book series and animes than my own life. 

   I have also found that I will occasionally have probably week long episodes of feeling unnaturally happy and energetic. During these periods, I feel overly-confident,  productive and like i cannot be stopped. I will often begin multiple writing projects during this time and get school work done. I also go on episodes and do dumb stuff like spend all my money on dumb things I do not need for no reason or begin relationships with people I do not feel attracted toward. I will also have periods of feeling really bad. I feel guilty and angry at myself. At this time I will have self harm urges and my suicidal thoughts will get even worse. I get extremely mad or upset over things like small noises (ticking clock, running water, breathing, etc.) or the sound of people talking around me or being touched. I have also found I find pleasure from gore and gore related videos and images (including pornography, whoops).

  I have been out of therapy for two years now and am unsure of how to go about asking my parents to have me go back. Does this sound like any sort of mental illness or condition anybody may know? Any coping tips? Thank you.

{tldr; I don't feel sympathy or empathy anymore. I  don't feel like I love or care about anyone. I have been having really bad and graphic suicidal thoughts. When not feeling emotionless, I have week or so long periods of feeling extremely happy and confident where I do dumb stuff like spend a lot of money and then periods of feeling extreme anger, guilt and sadness. I find pleasure from gore. Any ideas if this could be some type of mental illness or disorder? Thank you.)",26Oct2018,1
5,"I'll try to make this short.

I've been having with my girlfriend for one year and a half now and since the beginning, I've been having like kind of ""flashbacks"" of seeing her having sex with her ex boyfriends - it happens daily and unexpectedly. 

I never saw her in bed with her exs, so that's not a proper flashback, but just my imagination. And it's in a raw way - it's like if I was seeing porn.

I've been having an issue at the beginning of the relationship: I felt like I NEEDED to know everything about what she did with her exs, what position she did, etc. I even had a friend who had sex with her multiple times a few years before I got with her - but by that time, he told me every detail about it. I didn't care back then, but now it just all came back to me and I can't stop thinking about it too, as flashbacks.

Random facts that might be linked but I'm not sure  (you tell me); my ex girlfriend cheated on me and I saw videos of her kissing other guys; traumatized me and my life went to depression and downhill after it / I never felt confident about my ""performance"" sexually / I don't feel good at all about her number of partners before me (7), or how old she was for her first time (15)

Am I the only one who experienced that kind of thing ? Is this normal ? Everyone I asked about this doesn't care about what their gf/bf did in the past.

Can this be fixed ? ",26Oct2018,1

It was a weird day , I haven't told anyone ever the shit that goes on in my brain , today I told 7 different people.   I feel relieved that i said something. I feel hopeful for the future.

7,"I truly think that I am one of a kind for some reason. It hurts to think that because I know it’s impossible. I cannot speak to others confidently, or be myself around people anymore. I honestly don’t know who I am at all and that hurts too. Any time I’m around people, all I do is want to run away, while at the same time I desperately want their company. I’m  incredibly narcissistic, and am constantly comparing myself to others to the point at which I’m going crazy. This keeps me from making friends because I’ll only settle for being the superior person (more handsome, smarter, funnier) and if I don’t feel like the best person I’m the room then I feel worthless. At the same time, I can’t help but shake when I’m in a crowded classroom because I’m paranoid that everyone is looking at me. Relationships are impossible for me and I don’t think I understand love, which sucks because I really wish I knew how to. This prevents me from getting intimate with girls because I can’t feel comfortable when I am physically with somebody in that way. I also have a problem with lying, for some reason I alway feel the need to exaggerate things in my life and I don’t understand why. I’m never not bored, and I feel like I’m trapped in a cage all day. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. If anyone has any advice on what I should do please let me know. Sorry if I sound like a cry baby or anything.

10,"Apologies in advance if this ends up being a long post. 

TL;DR: I’m depressed, trying to find balance between passive, aggressive and assertive in my marriage and restore some of what I loved to the relationship. Also clearly needed to vent based on the length of that.

I’m diagnosed depressed, and have been for most of my life. 

A little background: My father was manic depressed for my whole life, and often suicidal. It’s definitely genetic... I’m a straight, cis female and on my second marriage with 2 kids.

Within many relationships I’ve always struggled to find balance. For instance, as a depressed teen, I skipped school, did drugs and had sex. I was loud and outspoken, in-your-face, angry and confrontational. My first husband was my high school sweetheart (aka we partied together) and we fought constantly. After I gave birth to our daughter I quit partying, he still hasn’t (17 years later).  We were constantly screaming and fighting. It was horrible. We split, another child, a marriage and after a total of 9 years together. It was the epitome of toxic.

My next relationship I decided would NOT be like that. My long term boyfriend of almost 5 years total and I never fought. He wouldn’t have it, and I hated it. We got along awesomely for about 4 years until he suddenly didn’t like anything about me anymore. I was almost completely passive, and happy until I learned we really didn’t know each other at all. It ended amicably.

My current marriage is to a great guy, but a total perfectionist. I have a shitty memory, and he likes everything just this certain and perfect way. We’ve been together 7 years, married 2.5. It goes in waves, but the last 2 years have been pretty awful, I was still in doormat mode, trying literally anything to stop the constant criticism from a perfectionist partner.... I feel entirely unsupported emotionally, and he’s always been weird about physical contact and PDA.  Total disconnect.

My depression has intensified over the past 2 years, but I feel like that’s more under control now than it has been in a long time.  (Thank you Celexa)

So I’m trying to find balance.... I don’t want to scream and be a stubborn asshole to get my way about everything, but I also am sick of letting everything go in the name of peace (especially since that didn’t work anyway and we still fight regularly). I’m speaking up, asserting my opinions, and trying to find me again in this mess... and I’m really struggling with it.  I’m not currently despairing and sad, but I’m just off my game, and have been for 17 years, since I was 17!! I don’t know who I am anymore after all the trauma and change and shit that’s happened... I want my happy relationship back, but also want to feel free to be myself again.

12,"Hey,
To clear the air, I am always willing to help those close to me out.  If they have something going on in their life, I’m always open to listen to them.  But one of the closest people around me have recently been throwing these pity-parties.  They suggest how they’re mentally unstable, talk about how sad they/their life is, then brush it aside when I ask them what’s up.
I told them just a few days ago they can come talk to me if anything is wrong.  I personally can’t deal with these childish pity parties that don’t help them and certainly don’t help me.  It just feels like a cycle - they complain and feel sorry for themselves, but when I offer them another way they push it aside.  

What should I do?  They are really important to me.  I want to help them out, it feels wrong to me to shut them out - I see them everyday and I truly do want to help them.",26Oct2018,1
13,Hi Guys. I’ve been going through the worst time of my life the past 2 years and it’s really just messed my mind up. I went from being the most confident guy to a person that thinks about suicide way too much. I’ve recently started a new journey and I chose to call it The Modern Alpha Project. I’ve always seen myself as an alpha I was a leader most of my life and that’s how I was raised but there are so many toxic habits and mentalities that come with thinking you’re alpha. So I want to redefine the word and think of a modern alpha as someone who doesn’t shy away from his/her weaknesses and insecurities and is ready seek help and help other. ,26Oct2018,1
14,"Hi! Over the past week, I made a major breakthrough in therapy and released a lot of pent up emotions. I had a lot of pent up anger from childhood towards my parents, and in general it was a very emotionally confusing environment growing up. Since releasing my painful emotions, my moods' been a lot better and I've been putting together the pieces of my life.

It's been a bit overwhelming too. I feel sudden bursts of happiness, but also sadness, anger, and anxiety. I've been much more confident and much more clearheaded. I have a sex drive again, and feel aware of myself for literally the first time I can remember. 

I'm growing concerned though. I have needed much less sleep, I haven't been eating much at all but feel completely fine. At the moment, I'm trying to calm myself down a bit, but I feel increasingly anxious that maybe I'm bipolar and I'll crash back into depression.

I don't think she understands how important it is for me to be with someone who understands me, and she says she still has feelings for me but romance reminds her of our messy breakup. I guess I feel stupid now, because for so long I wanted to die because of trauma and mistakes and now I'm just overwhelmed with the fact that I fucked up a relationship with one of the only people who cares about me and who fits me. I'm a lonely 23-year-old girl but I have a chance, a date coming up with the new person, but I can't get it out of my head that life without my ex isn't worth living. I can't exactly bring that up to her though because it's seriously guilt-tripping and I know she's having a hard time in her personal life too. But I wish she would just tell me already if she wants to pursue the relationship again or not, because she said she would have to think about it … I don't know how long that means and I don't feel comfortable bringing it up again. I was wondering if anyone had tips on how to practice living for yourself? Being comfortable with being alone when your mental illness makes you dependent on validation from others? I'm trying to pursue my goals but even that comes back to ""If I do this, I'll be worthy of her and she'll want to be together again"" which I know is unhealthy. ",26Oct2018,1

21,"So I woke up today feeling terrible. Daily anxiety is a given for me, but it was worse than normal.  For context, I have issues with anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Anyway, by the time I'd gotten to work, I was holding back tears for no apparent reason. I decided to talk to my girlfriend and vent for a minute, and she advised me to talk to my boss (I work as a caregiver in an Alzheimer's specialization facility). Right off the bat I could tell it was a bad idea. She seemed reluctant to even talk to me in private and when I tried telling her about what was going on, she hardly seemed sympathetic or interested and just asked if I wanted to talk to the nurse so that she can ""asses"" me, which was as unhelpful as that sounds. Trying to even describe what I was feeling was quite difficult since there wasn't any inherent reason I was upset. My boss told me ""we all have days like that, you just need to power through. I'm having a day like that too! For you to leave is putting your co workers and the residents at risk"". Don't get me wrong, I understand what she was saying about my co workers and the residents, but I was more bothered by her attitude towards my issues. For someone who doesn't struggle with anxiety and depression, what she said probably sounds reasonable. But for anyone who does know the struggle, it's probably one of the most ignorant and patronizing things that anyone, let alone someone you would think would at least have a rudimentary understanding of mental health, could say. It's the equivalent of someone saying to a depressed person ""it's okay, we all get sad sometimes! You just need to buck up."". In the end, someone did end up coming in to finish my shift for me.

Background info: (Skip if you want)
I’m in my *first year at university* and I’m trying to make friends. My only official diagnosis is *adhd* but I definitely have some *anxiety* and my doctors acknowledge that. My main mental health thing right now is some *trauma from an abusive relationship* a year ago. My relationship with my sexuality is not the healthiest one as of yet but I’m *working on it*

Important part:
I’ve been to *one party* with alcohol present but I’ve never been drunk. Because of my issues mentioned previously, *I don’t handle impairment well.* I’m not planning on drinking unless it’s with a very close group of friends and I never plan on getting fully drunk. Because I’m starting university, I’m starting to notice party culture. I want to have fun with my new friends but I *don’t feel safe at parties.* I feel like either something bad will happen or I’ll get ignored by drunk people while I cry on the floor.

I was going to get my *current boyfriend* to tag along to them but he’s *still in high school* this year and he won’t be going to my same university 

So basically I’m asking how to handle all this stuff so I can feel safe at parties. I need to find out who I can trust because I need someone who’ll watch me and make sure I’m okay. Maybe I just need to vent. I don’t know. I just... how do I feel safe in an environment like that?",26Oct2018,1

I’m (19, F) in college as a music performance major balancing classes, hours of rehearsals everyday, 2 instruments, and 4 private lessons a week. I’m a freshman and I can say most of freshman year I’ve felt kind of sad on and off and also and EXTREMELY stressed. Two days ago I was getting ready for my violin lesson (which I was unprepared for) and also was thinking about a performance I have Friday. I was so stressed and overwhelmed that I had this desire for everything to just pause. I felt time  was going too quickly and I was unable to do everything. While I was playing violin to warmup I suddenly was hyperventilating and my hands went completely numb and my legs were shaking. I called my roommate for help and this went on for about 15 min. I felt weird for the rest of the day. It was my first panic attack. This really showed me how stressed I am. The problem is that my stress is also caused by my lack of motivation and also procrastination. I don’t know. I’m confused. 2 days after the panic attack it’s like my emotions don’t work properly?

28,"I can make friends pretty easily, but that's only if it's a friend of a friend. And it's impossible for me to walk up to someone and start chatting, I don't know how these people do it. If I'm in a class with a friend I have little to no anxiety, yet if they're absent then I shut up like a clam and space out. Just last year I would have panic attacks when giving a presentation but then those faded away, now I'm reasonably comfortable giving presentations. I do struggle a lot with eye contact, it's not that I freak out if I look into someone's eyes, it's just that I don't know when and where to look and for how long. Occasionally I'll forget that I have that consideration and it comes naturally, but then I realize that and it's back to square one. Getting to the more considerable stuff, I seem to have a constant need to top my friends in everything except for people I don't know. I always seem to feel wrong and that everyone else knows how to act perfectly so I just mirror what I see, but I guess everyone has their home personality and their public personality. I have a grave fear of awkward silence after telling a joke, but I suppose that's a fear everyone has but this renders me useless in a small, joking group of unfamiliar faces. Something I really struggle with is matching another's mood when I'm talking to them; I always find myself extremely boring in comparison to someone I may be talking to, and when they laugh I attempt to create fake laughter and make comments that they would want to hear. In all honesty when some people are telling me things, I couldn't care less, much less find it hilarious as they do. But obviously it is very rude to just tell them that. But then again, it seems to be working just fine, I'm just very desperate for friends even though I have many. Lastly (if you're still reading), I am significantly more critical of what I say when I am around girls. A long time ago a girl was calling me weird and for the life of me I could not figure out what I was saying that was so weird, looking back I assume it was just banter but I guess the damage is done. But this fine filter I have completely inhibits me from making friends with girls, let alone having a relationship. 

I don't really consider these problems serious (besides the girl part, that is defcon 1 for me) but whoever reads this maybe suggest ways I can aid some of these problems? I can't go back to a therapist, the last one said I have severe anxiety but that was years ago, (and if you read my little rant here you can probably tell I'm not as anxious as can be) I'm trying to become a pilot and I need to submit a record of all medical visits from a given amount of time, and I received the data I had to input and a diagnosis from 2015 which was never changed says severe anxiety. If they see severe anxiety there I cannot become a pilot, and I certainly do NOT feel anxiety to this degree. With that, what should I do to get this diagnosis changed?

33,"Some backstory: I had a pretty rough childhood. Father was abusive towards my mother, witnessed him beat the crap out of her all the time. I was put under an immense amount of strain as a kid (I was no more than 6) and was neglected a bit due to the violence at home. Parents filed for divorce, father kidnapped me, then I returned to my mom and never saw him again. Developed some severe daddy issues and all that fun stuff. 

Anyways, for my present issue: For the past year or so these memories have been hitting really hard. They've always been a daily thought but now they're starting to interfere with my life. I keep replaying the events in my mind at seemingly random moments. Occasionally I get hit with a super *vivid* memory and my heart rate shoots up and I get this horrible sense of dread or panic(?). I kinda phase out sometimes too and relive the past. It's honestly really bad for getting things done in school lol. 

It should be noted that I'm almost 17 so a teenager. These feelings could be purely hormonal, I really don't know. Just kinda curious if this is just what childhood trauma is like.

34,"I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was 15. I took medication for about 3 years, and although I never felt ‘all right’, I finished my treatment and got off meds with ‘feeling less bad’ as my major achievement. I’m now 21 and recently started going to the doctor again, after a severe and long depressive stage, almost suicidal at times. The doctor started treating me for bipolar disorder, as he noted my ‘depression’ wasn’t just aggravated sadness, but a hot mess of well... emotional shit. That being said, I’ve NEVER ever felt ‘manic’, maybe stressed on extreme and rare occasions, but that was about it. I have basically juggled between being less or more depressed. So, yeah, Seroquel at nights and wellbutrin in the morning helped a lot, for a couple weeks until now. My purging/binge cycle is scaring me and I’m vomiting 4-5 times a day; I feel annoyed (for lack of a better word) with my own sense of self.. with the awareness of my body, so much I feel like bugs crawling in my skin — I shiver if I put my mind on it; I can’t sleep, maybe the first sign of things going downhill was that falling asleep became harder a couple days ago.... now that I think about it. As a matter of fact, I haven’t slept for the past 38 hours. I feel restless. Like unhinged but still grasping enough ‘patience’ to remain visibly at ease.

38,I have an anxiety disorder and I’ve tried seeking help for it with various therapists and doctors but they seem more interested in treating depression over anxiety. I haven’t had depression since high school but for some reason the psychologist I’ve been visiting has only prescribed meds for depression which have done nothing. She has tried about half a dozen depression meds without any success and when I tell her I really want help with anxiety rather than depression she says dealing with depression will fix my anxiety. This doesn’t make any sense to me because I’m really not depressed to begin with.

Everyone wants to be confident, but not everyone knows what it takes to actually be able to make confidence a [**part of their lives**](https://zanawellness.com/2018/10/09/4-proven-ways-to-fight-inflammation-in-your-body/). If you find yourself struggling to be truly confident (hi, that would be me over here), it might be that you need to focus on it in a different way – often, it is one of those things which you need to look at in a particular way if it is to work for you. As it happens, giving yourself the kind of confidence you might be looking for is not actually all that difficult – or at least, it shouldn’t be. We tend to overthink things in our minds as human beings. In this article, we are going to discuss some of the things you can do to give yourself a boost of confidence in no time, so that you can effectively lead a more fulfilling life.

### 📷

### Accept Your Flaws

Something that a lot of people have trouble with is [**accepting their flaws**](https://www.bustle.com/articles/104451-7-ways-to-accept-and-celebrate-your-flaws-because-we-all-have-them), particularly when they lack self-confidence. If you are not a very confident individual, then it is that much more likely that you will focus on those parts of yourself which you don’t approve of or which you wish to change in some way. However, the problem there is that by doing so you will inadvertently be worsening the problem – for focusing on such things in such a negative light is hardly going to help your confidence levels. If anything, it will make them worse. Of course, that doesn’t mean that you should ignore them either – merely that it is a good idea to calmly accept your flaws with self-love, so that you can feel much better about whatever problems you might have.

📷

### Smile

There is something unexplainable that happens when you smile. Not only do you improve how you appear to others, but you also seem better to yourself, or at least you feel better, and that clearly is something worth trying to aim for. A lot of people have trouble smiling openly and clearly simply because they are ashamed of their oral health – if that is the position you are in, then it is definitely worth looking into what you can do to improve that. As it happens, there is always plenty that can be done, from simple teeth whitening to getting a [**tooth crown**](https://www.meridiandentalak.com/same-day-crowns-in-wasilla-ak/) should that be necessary. Whatever it takes, as long as you are happy with your teeth, you will be able to smile with greater confidence, and that will make a surprising difference to how you feel about yourself.

📷

### Push Your Boundaries

Finally, the more that you [**push your boundaries**](https://tinybuddha.com/blog/being-out-of-your-comfort-zone-opening-up-pushing-boundaries/), the more confident you will feel, so make sure that you are doing so as often as you possibly can. When you do something outside of your comfort zone, it means that you prove to yourself what you are capable of! The more you do this, the more that you appear capable of, so it is a great and permanent way to boost your confidence. It’s also going to ensure that you are living life much more fully, which is something you can’t really say is a bad thing.",26Oct2018,1
42,"I lost my brother to suicide a few years ago. I grew up taking care of my depressed mother who was very sick all the time. I was diagnosed at 12 with depression and and moiety which have gotten much worse in the last 10 years. So in a way I feel very responsible for others. But I get angry like I just don't have the energy to worry about anyone else. I'm going through a lot right now. Lots of life transitions. Grieving, still. Just a lot of stress. 
I feel like if I don't drop everything and give said depressed people all my energy, something bad will happen and it'll be my fault.

48,"What would you do if you were suddenly naked in front of a bunch of people? most likely you would be ashamed, I wouldn't; not because having good self steem but because clothes are irrelevant to me and just an addon to cope with nature.

Same goes for many things, I need a logical explanation for things, just like I wasn't born with a name, it was assigned to me, hence I don't feel attached to any name since it's arbitrary, and I have socially changed it many times, depending on the circumstances; my pets had no real names either, their calling command was assigned depending on a sound they made or an attribute, and assigned numbers if they were equal, so something like mini-meaow the second was a thing XD.

People think I am either rude or honest, because I say what I think, I do how I believe, even if everyone else does it differently; I don't feel the so called social pressure, I know it's there, but it's irrelevant; it's not like I break all social norms, more than I just go on with them drastically differently; but if I have to break the norms to achieve something I will.

People have regrets, I don't regret anything, I see life as a learning experience that give me wisdom, including my own mistakes; I don't deny them being mistakes, but I don't regret them either; I see virtually everyone mourning themselves with regret and guilt, that it makes me wonder, what the fuck, is that the normal? o_O hell I have no idea what regret feels like.

This is as like the day I was kidnapped, 3 days, shitload of bruises, and when it was done; I just kept going; no trauma, no PTSD, I didn't even hate the guys, I'm clear, the psychiatrist just said ""well fuck it, you are clear"", it was actually a pretty important experience; I mean, I just had no logical reason to be, traumatized?... uh uh.

But you know that makes it hard to make friends, after all I am a social animal; none really knows or understands me, they get freaked out when they realize that I am rationalizing everything they take for granted, so while at the beginning they treat me as this clueless pal who has child like innocence (literally LOL), if I try to be honest they stay away XD, because I'm, weird!... even thought I am actually nice, and even almost vegan because I like animals c: they are cute, even spiders! don't kill them :&lt;",26Oct2018,1
49,"Im so angry lately, and I hate it. I hate it so much. Im not an angry person. After 29 years I know that about myself. Its actually extremely hard to make me angry to the point where I currently am.

Perhaps agitated is the right word? I feel like I need to scream. My entire body is lit up.

Currently its because I feel like I'm being treated like a child by my roommates.

Every month I give them my rent on the day I specified I could before we even started looking for a place together. I have a very restricted income, and am unable to save much so there's no way I could even fathom giving them the rent earlier than the agreed upon date. Im going on a small trip here soon and it will be between now and after the date I said I can pay rent, so I wont be home to give it to them in person. They want it before I leave. Even though I already told them I can send it to them via the many ways people are able to transfer money these days.

Ive made it quite clear multiple times since I moved in, multiple times since Ive lived here, that I cannot give them the rent earlier than I said I could. Ive been completely honest with my financial situation since the beginning, and they keep harassing me about it even though Im never late with the rent.

This isnt the only thing theyve done. They have even gone as far as setting up a chore list for everyone. Ive had them bust into my room in the morning before, and ask if I knew whose day it was to do what chores. It was mine. Not like I didnt know since its posted on the damn fridge. They will go around and check too, and if it isnt done to their specifications will get super pissed off. One of them pushed over a bunch of chairs and broke some glasses, while the other just absentmindedly agrees with them.

Its a pair. A boyfriend and girlfriend. I can talk to the girl while the guy isnt around, but the moment hes home its like shes gone and flipped a switch to be his 'yes man'. Anything he wants he gets. Ive told her thats the stupidest bullshit Ive ever seen, and she will agree, until he comes back home at least.

They even have days they want me to cook for them, even though Ive only cooked for myself since I have a different diet and they never return the gesture, nor do they invite me to eat if they do cook.

My PTSD, anxiety, and MDD don't handle conflict well, at all. Being even the slightest upset, and feeling unable to fix it, makes it even worse. Conflict is how I got the PTSD in the first place.

I cant even talk to them properly, because they obviously dont listen. If anyones the child around here, its them. They are older than me too, which makes it even more astounding.

Im tired, agitated, sad. I feel like crying, screaming, and punching something at the same time. I could do those things, but it wouldnt fix anything. I know that.

Talking reason to them is damn near impossible, so thats out the window too.

I am unable to move at the moment too, so Im stuck like this!

So, Im here. Ranting I guess.

If I knew it was going to be this way I would have gotten my own place like I planned, even if it would make money even tighter.

So my cousin, let’s say, Dave, is my best friend. He’s basically a brother to me. He’s always had poor mental health. Originally it was abandonment issues and a sort of spoiled kid syndrome, as his mom left him (but not his two brothers) with her father and the woman he was then married to, my grandmother. About a year and a half ago Dave met a girl online, Abigail. Abigail was about as mentally unhealthy as Dave was, and in mostly the same ways. They ended up in a relationship very fast that, during their ups, made them both very happy. But in their downs the relationship was downright toxic for Dave. He never told me how bad it was until they broke up a few months ago. Abigail was getting ready to come meet Dave irl in just a few days, when he logs into her snapchat and sees a picture of her with some other guy, shirtless, with a bunch of hearts on it. He immediately broke it off with her and spent the following week deleting or burning EVERYTHING that had to do with her. He even cut a scar into himself of her initial during the relationship and cut an X over that. He enters a grieving process that neither of us identified until recently. As of late, I think he’s in the depression stage. On top of this, he recently wrestled with himself about whether or not he wanted to be in a relationship with another girl. He thought about it for a long time before he decided to go for it, but during the conversation that he planned on leading into asking her out, she admits she’s into someone else and I think this was for the better. It’s my belief that this girl was not good for Dave. Finally, I’ve recently entered a very healthy and happy relationship that Dave not only knows about, but even helped me attain. He was the one to talk the courage into me to ask her out on a date in the first place. I’ve talked to Dave about said relationship a few times, and thanked him for helping me into it. All three of these things seem to be mounting on Dave. Dave was suicidal when he was a preteen, before we started talking and getting along so well. I’d known him all his life, but didn’t start making friends with him until he was about 13. He had two failed suicide attempts before we became friends. Since then, he’s been okay. We love each other like brothers, and he’s sworn to me that no matter what happens, he will never kill himself while I’m alive. Lately, he’s admitted to me that pact is the only reason he hasn’t tried. He’s told me some other very worrying things. Things that a therapist would be legally obligated to place him in a mental hospital for. He’s not a danger to others, but to himself. I won’t say anything specific but I will say he’s had some very dark thoughts. Darker than I thought was possible for him which is saying something. I’m hoping this monumental depressive episode is simply a combination of the grieving process, his recent difficulty with relationships and watching my relationship unfold, and he’ll be okay in under a week, but I don’t know what to do or think. I’ve made him aware that I love him and that I’m there for him, which I think helped him a tiny bit. But I don’t know if he’ll be okay. He’s refused to go to a therapist because he’s afraid of being thrown in a mental hospital, but there is a multitude of undiagnosed mental disorders Dave has and I’m extremely worried about him right now. I guess what I’m saying is, is there anyone reading this that has had experience with toxic relationships, depression, or poor mental health as a whole that could give me some insight or advice on what’s going on? I don’t know where else to ask. Thank you for bothering to read this far.",26Oct2018,1

My friend is depressed and I'm worried he may try to kill himself--that's the gist of this post. The problem is that I don't know him in person. We met through a Discord DnD group and it's been loads of fun for half a year now! But recently I noticed him being very clingy around me and when I brought up that he should be clingy around his long distance girlfriend, he suddenly opened up about how she doesn't want to talk to him and how he's starting to see problems with her.

When I suggested he talk to her about these issues, his girlfriends just straight-up jumped ship and dumped him. Barely even tried. After that, his whole attitude went down hill. He mentioned wanting to hurt himself, starting degrading himself, and just tonight, started saying things that could lead to suicide. I've been with him through this for about 2 weeks now, trying CBT techniques I've learned from my own therapist, and other things like that. He's been on the mend, but relapsed really bad lately.

I keep trying to tell him to start a healthier lifestyle and make changes, but he's so rock bottom that I can barely motivate him to eat! And yes, he's mentioned wanting to deny himself food. Now the obvious options would be to go see a mental health professional and/or get some meds. But his parents have very little money, dont trust clinical drugs, and dont want to drive him to see a therapist (he has no license).

I've tried to keep this guy going, and as far as I can tell, I'm the only one who's shown any compassion towards him lately. But I haven't known him that long and I ain't a professional. So I can't keep doing this. I've already started on contacting his sibling (he just got back to me) but now I need a way to get this guy help through other means. I've heard about mental health apps in which you can just talk and vent your feelings to people, mental health professionals or not, but I don't know where to start looking. I've also heard of an app that if your situation is bad enough, they can provide a therapist to you for a lower price...but again, I don't remember the name.

I'm currently studying abroad in a foreign country and I don't have time to get too heavily involved in this situation. I need for this guy to start to stand on his own a lil. If any of y'all know what to do, please help. I've been through depression before myself and I know how awful it is, I don't want him suffering under this anymore.

60,"Ive been told that I tend to be expressionless or have an intense vibe. In the sense that I always seem on edge with everything with my life. It was suggested my a close friend who knows a bit about psychology that I might be a narcissist or have psychopathic traits, but I dont believe that. I simply refuse to be seem as someone who is imperfect. I care about those close to me, and I try my best to make them feel happy. I cried a lot as a child due to constant abuse, but now I never do that. I'm too disgusted and constantly angry about things not going my way. But there are moments where I question my own thoughts and mannerisms from 

I had aspirations and goals. I felt like I had control of my life, knowing that I'm heading to the right direction. After finishing high school and getting rid of everyone I despised back then, now I cant help but to feel isolated, which usually isnt a problem, but unhealthy. I've never valued anyone's life. I never really cared if they were in pain or suffering. If I ever saw anyone I knew from before hurt or even in pain, I'd genuinely enjoy it. I've realized ever since I was a child that people are naturally selfish and cruel. There is no reason to feel guilt or shame over hurting them. They will all die sooner or later, they bring little to no value to me. It's like as if they are purely there to just exist.

I always had this deep sense of insecurity, especially with an unstable childhood full of abuse and bullying. I always felt things too deeply I think...but now it's like I feel nothing for anyone. Whenever someone tells me I have to care about others, I am just disgusted at the thought of it. Its pathetic. Every word I speak to others is like purely pretending to conform and to be seen as empathetic. The only thing that's true to myself is the desire to achieve and the desire to Express my frustrations/boredom onto others. I actually look great...but I feel that I must be perfect. I define perfection as being able to Express themselves fully with no sense of anxiety and insecurity. Unfortunately I tend to fall to this, but not heavily lucky enough.

I view my life as quite dull and filled with people who believe their ideologies matter. Yes i am a hypocrite because i myself have them. But nothing truly matters, yet I still care about my desire for excitement. I can't explain why I feel nothing when facing peoples personal issues personally, seeing them hurt or overall seeing a bad situation from others is almost like a perverted desire. I know most will not agree, but this is how I view the world, full of people who are just as disposable, with the exception of those I care about deeply. I desire perfection in my life, and perfection to me is to do whatever I want, free of judgement of others. People are honestly disgusting.",26Oct2018,1
61,"About me.

Age: 20 yrs, Residence: India, Education: Currently in college.

I am listing my possible symptoms below:

1. **Lost in thought.** Nowadays I spent most of the time deep in thoughts where I am living a completely different life.The more time I spent on those thoughts the more I lose touch with reality. Most of the time I cannot stop thinking. Yesterday I only stopped thinking when I hit one of the furniture while I was thinking and walking. Most of the time I walk while I think. Here is one of the examples of what life I live in my thoughts: `""This one I started having from 3 months ago. In this thought I am a footballer and living the life of the footballer. The horrifying thing about this is I am spending say close to 1 hour in this thought(it never happens together in small intervals say of 7-8 mins but it happens throught out the day) and I live all parts of a footballers life from training, playing matches, doing press conference, travelling, having family. Its horrifying because it feels very real"".` I currently live 2-3 other lives in one of which I am a famous businessman and other I am the PM.
2. **Lack of concentration.** I think I havent been able to concentrate in a thing straight for more than 20 minutes. Most of the time I am trying a thing for say 7-8 min, then I get up from my seat and spent next 10 min deep in thoughts. Even when I have exam on the next day I am still unable to concentrate. Two months ago I have an examination and I had two day to prepare for it, what I did was I spent all the time like this not being able to concentrate. I always knew I havent read a single thing about it and tried to sit down and study but without any success. I only got to sit down and study only when I had 2 hrs left before the exam. This is not only one instance it is happening with me with almost every exam I just cant sit down and study at all irrespective of whether I like the subject or not. Even while writing this post I could not count the number of times I got lost in thought.
3. **Feeling of superiority.** Sometimes I feel I am a superior being, I am much more mature and much smarter and feel my friends or family will never be able to understandand me or do what I can do.
4.  **Struggling with the basics of daily life.** I have stopped taking care of myself. My mom has been asking me for past 2 weeks to get a shave and get a haircut because they are looking awfully bad and I am completely aware of the fact. I havent applied any soap or lotion to feets for months even though the climate is very dry. I dont cut my finger nails on time and hardly care how I look. I face trouble staying on schedule or finishing what they start. Sometime when I start something I am unable to complete it. I have started around 30 courses on coursera in 2 years but havent completed any. On average I complete first two weeks in 2-3 days then I abandon it.
5. **Lost connection with the society.** I havent had a meaningful conversation with anyone for months and I hardly talk with anyone without my needs. I dont like attending any event. Even when some of friends make plans to go out and invite me though I sometimes go out with them but most of the time I feel like staying at home inspite of knowing I will have a great time with them. 
6. **Other symptoms.**  loss of pleasure or interest, difficulty in remembering, difficulty in understanding instruction.

It would be of great help if someone can guide me what I should do now. If I should consult a physician should I consult someone in general medicine or any kind of specialist.",26Oct2018,1

65,"I've been dealing with dissociative symptoms for a while now. They were mostly mild, though. 

I mainly experienced depersonalization, e.g. seeing my face in a mirror or window and not being able to connect with it. This can get scary because it feels like someone is staring deeply into your soul, yet this person isn't you. 
Whenever I am extremely stressed out my memory gets really bad.

Now what I experienced was something different. I was at therapy when this happened. I started to feel my muscles get tense and I couldn't relax. It felt like I wasn't able to move at all. I forced my head to look at my therapist, but I couldn't focus. Everything became blurred. I wasn't able to hear what my therapist was talking about but I knew they were. I was trapped in myself. My body ""split"" into to parts. The left part remained tense, as it was. The right part began to feel lighter. I had a cotton-candy feeling in the right side of my mouth. I felt like I was beeing moved to that side. My body began to ache. There was a tingling numbness in the right half of my body. I noticed my therapist stopped talking. But I wasn't looking at them anymore. I couldn't say anything. It felt like I was holding on to a tiny straw of reality only and I tried so hard to break out of this situation. With all my srenght I was able to move my arm. Thankfully my therapist noticed that I was stuggling and I regained control. I didn't know how to explain any of this.

I still don't know what to think about this. Just needed to get this of my chest, so I can move on.",26Oct2018,1

67,"A lot of self help stuff for overcoming insecurity and egocentrism that I have read have their number 1 piece of advice being ""its not about you."" I get that in concept and I like it, but as an insecure person these egoistic fears, thoughts, feelings, and beliefs are natural, and I can't just whisk them away. 

For example, when I pass two people whispering to each other, my egocentric thoughts first and foremost go to ""they are talking about me."" Even if I say to myself ""don't be ridiculous"" that original thought still stays, and I can't get it to go away.

This is what I hate about people saying ""Just stop making it about yourself"" I WANT to stop making it about myself, or at least I consciously do (subconsciously probably not, I mean look at what I am doing, I am making a post all about myself, how egotistical), but my mind won't stop making it about myself.

68,"The explosion of autism diagnoses popped up with the advent of the internet, videogames, mass pornography, news media fearmongering, mass psychiatric diagnoses &amp; drugging, declining wages &amp; job opportunities, decline in church attendance &amp; extracurricular attendance, feminism, skyrocketing divorce rates, the end of the housewife, politically-correct public school environments which foster passive-aggressive social clique bullying in exchange for repressing physical fights. 

All of these have created a segment of young men who have atrophied social skills and athleticism and, most significantly, no desire to participate in social life.

A significant number of  these men have practically no positive social experiences or fulfilling relationships in their lives. They stop engaging at some point, usually around high-school when people start becoming sexually active and socially competitive, get taken to a bunch of psychiatrists by their useless parents, get diagnosed with Autism Spectrum, get drugged with meds that make them even more lethargic and overweight, and usually end up in their parent's basement well into adulthood.

72,"PTSD might be a little extreme, but I live in constant fear and paranoia that my home will become infested with bed bugs again.

Several years ago, I was living in an apartment by myself and realized I had bed bugs, and the experience of living with them and trying to get rid of them was one of the most stressful of my life.

I had to pay hundreds of dollars of my hard earned money to spray the place and get a storage unit, I got rid of my bed and tons of my stuff, I had to deep clean every inch of my apartment, and I basically had to do all of it by myself.

When I eventually moved out, I went to insane precautions to insure I didn't spread them to my new home, living with my girlfriend and her parents, and at one point we had a scare where her stepdad thought he found some and told me they were going to have to pay a ton of money to rid the place. I have never felt so incredibly terrible as I did on that day, but then I was immensely relieved when it turned out he was wrong, and had put me through hell for no reason.

We are now living in a new apartment, just my girlfriend and I, and even though I have not seen one solid piece of evidence that they have returned, I am terrified of a new infestation. Every   time I feel an itchy bump on my leg, or see a black piece of lint on my sheets, that fear and panic rises again. 

Bed bugs are just so disgusting, and violating, and insidious. When you have an infestation, the one place you should be able to feel at ease, in your bed, starts to feel like a panic stricken nightmare.

We keep the place as clean as we can, and we take precautions, and my girlfriend isn't worried about it, but even though I've moved twice, and rid myself of almost all of my old possessions, I can't rid myself of this paranoia that they will return, and ruin my life again.",26Oct2018,1

75,"Tl;dr: Today a coworker told me she loved her job, and it made me wonder if maybe I have anxiety or depression, not just feeling a little down due to adhd. Not sure if I only feel down so I can use it for attention, or if I need help.



I currently work in a warehouse while applying to jobs in my field of expertise. I haven't been able to get a job I want so far, and my adhd is not helping in this regard. I've bounced from side job to side job, and between being jobless and working for minimum wage in shitty to meh places I really started to feel down.


I assumed this was how everyone in these jobs felt, but today a coworker that started at the same time as me said she ""loved going to work today"". Idk it made me question if maybe I was feeling more down than I should.


I did some online mental health tests and they all point out I score high on the depression and anxiety scale. But then most of those sites also try to sell self help related stuff, and some adhd symptoms overlap with depression, like inability to focus. They also seem to lump 'thinking about death' together with 'having suicidal thoughts'. I don't have the latter but I do think about death a lot. But I also feel like a part of me is just using those thoughts to create a reason for pity, like I just think these things so I can nag about it to other people to get their attention. Other people have it way worse and I'm just here thinking about things I know will get people worried, even though I have no reason to actually feel this way. I haven't told anyone for this reason. Also told my psychiatrist I was pretty sure I wasn't depressed, just a little down, because I know what a real depression is vs just not having your day. But I've been 'not having my day' for over 6 months now. And I honestly don’t know if I'm exaggerating my feelings for pity party reasons and to become the center of attention, or if this is what anxiety or depression feels like. I thought depression was more a lack of emotion and interest, not just being sad for not getting what I want. And shouldn't I be more anxious to have anxiety? 




I just don't see how I can be happy in the future again even if I get into a job I like. I feel like I opened my eyes to how cold and alien the concept life is and I can't unsee it. Like being happy in the past was only possible because I blocked certain things from my head. But then I also get angry at myself for being so melodramatic. I have not lived through trauma, I have loving parents, I have a boyfriend, I have friends, so no freaking reason to feel like this. Just because I currently don't work a job I love doesn't mean I should declare life meaningless. I'm just being manipulative with my mind to childishly get my own way, which just isn't happening any time soon. Everyone else deals with life, I should just suck it up and stop whining. 



I kind of feel ashamed for even posting this, cause I hate to use something people actually struggle with just to get attention. But then, sometimes I feel so down I don't know if I'm making it up for tantrum purposes or if there is some legitamicy to it. A part of me wants it to be legitimate so people will worry about me, and I find that so tasteless and disgusting.

she didn't give a shit  about me. no empathy. Didn't really care what I had to say or how I am  feeling. All she cared about was writing her report that she has to send  to the health insurance company and be done with it

then she talked bad about therapists and psychologists.

It felt like she didn't believe me when I told her about my problems.

She didn't understand why I can't go to work and said I should just go

then she talked bad about what I studied (no idea why?)

And then she asked me if I want to take medicine. I told her that I am not sure. And I wanted to tell her my  concerns about taking meds and what my therapist told me about it

she said therapists know nothing about meds and then she wrote down  about me in her report that ""the patient refuses to take medicine""

And that she is just wasting her time here with me then.

and then in the end I just said that I guess I could try some meds.

So she prescribed me something and I could go after that.

And all that happened in just 5 minutes and then she was done.

I am feeling very angry

On Wednesday my girlfriend of a year and a half attempted to end her life by jumping off the side of a large rock face. Fortunately I knew where she was going and I was able to get there before she did. Over the course of an hour I got her away from the edge and into my car. 

  From there I was able to get her home and then to the hospital where she is currently being evaluated. Now I don't know how to proceed. I have made her job aware of what happened without the details and they have her responsibilities covered. Today will be the first time I will get to see her since she was admitted. Having never dealt with this kind of situation before I was hoping to get some advice on what I can do to help her or anything else I need to take care of. 

 What questions should I ask her doctor?
What can I do to help her?
What should I say or not say?
How can I make her transition back home easier?
Etc.  

 I don't know much about anything but I know I still love her and I know she's alive at this point that is all that matters. Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.

85,"I see it as exploitive, and I'm pretty confident that it's a reasonable view. It isn't clear that any therapy could help me, but even if there was, it would fail from the start because all therapists insist on taking such an adversarial position. The best evidence for what makes therapy work is the relationship between therapist and patient; having a ""working alliance."" But, since every therapists insists on such an extreme, one-sided contract before even beginning therapy they make it nearly impossible for a working alliance to form, now that I'm aware of this issue. 

I'll try to pre-empt some counter arguments some of you might have.

*Why not talk to a therapist about it?* It isn't worth their time. They usually have enough other people who want to be clients that they don't need you. Also, it isn't like they're going to change their contract for me; it isn't negotiable for them. It's take it or leave it, but since every therapist has that position it effectively means therapy with *any* therapist isn't an option.

*You have to do the work, and they can't control that.* It's the same from the client's side too. The issue would be resolved for me if a therapist would agree to be ""paid"" with ""money"", like Monopoly money. They did their service and I gave them ""money."" How beneficial the service is to me is my problem, not the therapist's. How beneficial the money is to the therapist is the therapist's problem, not mine. I can't control if they can't buy things with Monopoly money. They need to do the work to find someone who will accept the fake money as payment. If the therapist isn't able to get enough out of the arrangement with me then they can walk away, and I can too. That would be a fair contract. So, I'm left with therapy either being exploitive or worthless.

*It works that way with other services so therapy is no different.* Other services are easier to measure, have more certainty. The nature of therapy makes it different. Sometimes people will say therapy isn't linear, it can take time to see benefits, etc. In that case, payment to the therapist should follow the same patterns. They'll be compensated based on how much good they do. That way, they'll have the right incentives to actually help people and over time the ones who can help people will be able to continue working as therapists and those who don't actually help people will leave the market.

There are services that don't make the same demands as therapists. For example, getting a haircut. If they do a bad job, they'll usually try to fix it with no extra charge. In contrast, you don't pay therapists a certain amount of money to fix (or help you fix) a problem in your life with the understanding that they'll keep helping you for as long as it takes. Another example: restaurants. If a restaurant gets your order wrong and they have to make several dishes to get it right you don't have to pay for the ones that weren't to your satisfaction. In contrast, you have to pay therapists even if a therapy session wasn't to your satisfaction.

*Therapists need to make a living too.* And I need to resolve the problems I'm having in my life.

*I don't see how it is exploitive.* The way it works is if they spend their time with you then you have to pay them regardless of how useful it was. They don't have to be useful. They have no obligation to be useful to you (you agreed to this before treatment, remember?). If they weren't helpful you have no way to get out of paying them the full fee, agreed to in advance. Like I mentioned above, it can take a long time for therapy to result in benefits and it doesn't always take a clear, one-direction path. **There's no way to know if therapy will help you or not unless you actually try it, but you have to agree in advance to pay the therapist even if it doesn't work.**

There's nothing stopping bad therapists from using good marketing to make you think they can help you when the actually can't. By the time you realize they're not helping you it is too late: you've spend weeks/months/years seeing them and spent thousands of dollars. All you can do is walk away, but they still got your money, and that's all they really need. Since it is hard to get accurate reviews of therapists they could go their whole career helping no one but still making a lot of money. As a client you could keep trying new therapists but there's no guarantee that any of them could help you, and eventually you'll run out of money and die.

Therapy is like an unregulated casino for desperate people. Of course the casino will say you *could* win money, but they'll make no guarantee that you will. But all bets are final, and there's no way for you to know if the games are rigged so that you never win. All you can do is either leave (suicide) or keep giving them money for bets that never turn out in your favor. That's why therapy is exploitive.",26Oct2018,1
86,"There is that song by the Talking Heads - ”How did I get here?” . I feel like I am David Byrne by asking myself that sometimes. I am by all accounts a successful person. I have a good job, a family and friends that care for me and I am happier than I was yesterday. 

What people didn’t understand was that beneath the surface I was a pretty conflicted person and was not happy. 

I hope this helps people see that mental health is a journey.  

In my own mind I think being happy means that you are at peace with yourself and do not have any intrusive, or obsessive thoughts.  I can finally sit in my own thoughts and not feel conflicted or have a lot of chatter.  I seem to be at this place now and in doing a mental inventory of my head, a lot of the noise and clutter seems to be gone. I am nervous to be posting this here because I don’t want this to be the end and know I will make mistakes again  but I want to continue this journey.

IT has been a journey. 

I have been in counseling for many years. I am 51 now and I started going (off and on) when I was in my 30’s. At the time I didn’t know what or why I was going to counseling. It started with me bitching about the people in my life. I was not happy and somehow thought that the other people in my life had problems. That was a short lived stint with the only male counselor I had. I had a lot of anxiety and was very reluctant to open myself up to others. I see this now much more clearly than I did then. I had so much noise in my head that I was battling that I found it hard to focus on the real things, real relationships, real people and I thought he would fix it. I didn’t realize at the time that wasn’t how counseling worked.

Years after I started going more and more online and eventually came to have a few affairs.  One thing led to another and before I knew it I was chatting and had an affair. I don’t mean to not take responsibility for my actions. I own them completely but I am convinced no matter who I was with I would have had an affair. My son was just turning 13 when I did. It was the same age as my father had an affair and left my mother. I am ashamed of my actions for the people I hurt. My wife, family and the woman I had an affair with. I hurt all of them . I  moved out for 4 months before being allowed to move back in and continue to work on myself and figure out what I wanted. 

I found one counselor, my fourth, and the one person that knows everything I have done and everything in my head. She got into the trenches with me and helped me see it all and understand myself. She challenged me in counseling and didn’t accept my rationalizations. She called bullshit when I needed it and gave me empathy when I needed that. There was no judgment but she would be disappointed if I took some steps backwards. 

When we started using EMDR therapy my anxiety got better. When my anxiety got better I could share more of my thoughts at home. When I got comfortable doing that I found myself going online less  and looking at porn less. When I thought things were better I would take a break and go back to counseling and found another little nugget in my head that needed to be dug out. After that was dug out I found myself being a little more calm and took up meditation and Buddhism to help. I still had obsessive and intrusive thoughts so I went to an energy healer. She  told me I had been  putting  a lot of my energy out towards others  and wondered how I functioned. She said she found 17 different energy fields in me. Not sure what that meant :)  . She cleared all that out (somehow – I am not sure  how all that works?) but eventually I found myself continuing to put that energy out towards others that I shouldn’t. The best way to explain is that my thoughts would drift to others needs and have empathy sometimes lots of empathy for others while ignoring my own needs. 

 I went back to my counselor and we worked some more and did more EMDR and eventually after sharing everything and digging into my childhood and figuring out what I was missing as a kid (empathy), I think I can say all that work has helped. I have realized how my unmet needs in childhood affected all my relationships and made me relatively “needy” for empathy. When I could not get empathy from those around me I created fantasies in my head or online or with other people that gave me what I needed. I thought I could help others by giving them empathy . Funny thing was I was trying to fill that hole in me when I was. That was unhealthy and caused a lot of harm in my life. 

So as I sit here today my thoughts for the first time in a very long time are focused on me and it is pretty quiet up there in my head which is what I would call peace and happiness. I am blessed to have had the ability to dig into these problem areas for me and blessed to have support to do so. I am blessed of all the people I have met in my life that have helped me on this journey.

I have the strong sense that we are all on a journey of some type and it is up for us to figure it out by being curious and having empathy for those parts of us which aren’t so perfect. We all want to do the right things but sometimes our past gets in the way of that. Inside out to happiness.

My general guidelines for counseling

-       Counseling is HARD work. It is exhausting. When you are exhausted from it - it means you are uncovering things that need to be talked about. 

-	Don’t hold back. Be completely honest. You don’t need to share it all at first but by sharing all that chatter in your head you are digging it out, showing it in the light and gaining understanding. It is nerve wracking to think about telling someone the worst parts of yourself. I get that. 

-      Open yourself up and being vulnerable. Practicing it in counseling will help you practice it in the real world with your partner or friends. It is the one thing to building a strong relationship. If you can share what scares you , your partner will. If you close off those vulnerable parts or don't share that with your counselor, or you partner, or a friend, you are keeping that part of you hidden and your partner will keep theirs hidden.  Of course there could be other stuff going on for your partner..you can only worry about what you do and your actions. 

-	Don’t be afraid to keep looking for another counselor if you aren’t comfortable. I have had counselors let me ramble for hours on end. I got nothing out of it. For me I needed a counselor to challenge me

-	Be open and inquisitive why you do things or what you feel. When you do something that you know is wrong do you feel centered or do you feel something from childhood

-	Keep plugging at it, take breaks, think about things and go back with your new ideas. IF you have a good counselor she/he will help you unravel it

-	Try alternate methods of counseling. I have used EMDR for my energy work and it has really helped.

87,"I don’t no where to post this? It’s impacting my job as I have to work with him 12 hours a day.

He can’t do the job properly he has been here longer than me so I am having to cover for him as well. Sometimes I get frustrated with him when he can’t do the most simple of things. Then he shouts at me like it’s my fault he is making the same mistake he made 100 times before. The thing is he thinks he is brilliant at the job but I think he knows something is wrong with him he is in denial. I want to help him but I guess he probably won’t help himself. It’s making my job a living nightmare. If a mistake gets through it comes back to me even though we both have the same job role. 

Here are some things I notice. 
He will stare off into space and you will just catch him staring blankly at you and he will start smiling/laughing. Sometimes it looks as if his eyes are about to roll back into his head or just look dazed out of it. 

Mutter to himself and get really angry over little things, which I need to calm him down. He can’t concentrate on the job and will make the same silly mistakes over and over and over again. 

He doesn’t wash and absolutely stinks some days I am nearly sick. 

I am practically babysitting him and managing him even though that’s not my job. I get paid the same as him if I was not there he wouldn’t be able to do the job. Nobody likes him as he is just plain weird. But I do want to get to the bottom of what’s up with the guy. ",26Oct2018,1
88,"Hi, apologies if this isn't the right place to ask for advice but I wasn't sure where else to go.

My partner doesn't really speak to his family - long history there - but he has always vaguely kept in touch with his dad. Visits at Christmas, birthdays, not much but enough to say hi a few times a year. He's always had health problems but they've largely been managed pretty well. 

Over the last 6 months or so though, he's been pretty much harassing my partner. He is having delusions about his phones being hacked and people stealing from him (it's definitely not true, we looked into it) and he goes on long, mostly incoherent rants about this frequently. He has cut off ties with nearly everyone and thinks that everyone is out to get him, with some very detailed ideas on how. We live in a different city about 100 miles away from him, and recently he got a train down with no notice and demand that we go and see him in a hotel in the city (8pm on a Friday was the first we heard of this), which my partner declined to do. It was quite upsetting for everyone involved. 

What would you recommend in this situation? My partner is pretty much at the point of cutting all contact with him, but we're both worried about his wellbeing. He refuses to admit that there's anything wrong, and will not seek help himself. I'm worried that he's a danger to himself. There are no other family members who can help out with this. ",26Oct2018,1

90,"I (21F) was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder when I was a preteen and then diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder at 18. I was violently gang raped when I was 13 and have some lingering PTSD (night terrors used to be constant. Got some help, they're way less frequent now) didn't start smoking until I was 19 (very isolated and neglectful upbringing), and I only smoked every so often, basically just whenever it was offered to me. Even when I started purchasing it, I only smoked it when I had friends to share with. I didn't like smoking alone.

Fast forward a couple years. It started to become close to the opposite. Once I turned 21 in August me and my boyfriend (we live together) were smoking daily. It helped me with my tantrums, anxiety, and depression. I didn't have close to the amount of symptoms I had when I was sober.

But then my tolerance grew and it started to become a bit costly (still illegal in NC so it's quite expensive) and my boyfriend wanted us to take a month long break to restart my tolerance. I agreed, I didn't want to see us stop saving money because I was too pussy to take a break.

I thought it would be easy. Every time we ran out of weed and I hadnt smoked for a day, I would feel my anxiety and depression and anger come at me full force and I would manipulate my boyfriend into giving in and buying more. I know, this is terrible.

But this time our roommate got involved and had a talk with me. He noticed I wasn't leaving my room ever and constantly smelled weed coming from it (he smokes too but only occasionally). I admitted to him that I manipulate my boyfriend into buying me weed and how bad I felt. He told me he wanted to help, so we all shook hands and agreed that no matter how bad I get, they wouldn't give in. I'm contemplating whether I should ever smoke again...

First night going to sleep without weed and...you know how weed kind of represses your dreams? I didn't even think about it trying to fall asleep. I had a night terror for the first time in years and it destroyed me the next day. I was having constant panic attacks and crying on and off, and my poor helpeless boyfriend had to sit through all of it with me. He called out of work for me because I was just incapacitated, I didn't wanna leave the bed.

That was a couple days ago. Yesterday was almost no better. Today is slightly better but im still so, so depressed. I regret agreeing to this and I just want to smoke again. Am I mentally addicted? Should I quit for good? It's just so helpful for me. From ages 17-20 I tried so many medications to help with my problems and nothing worked like weed does. Not to mention pills can be almost just as expensive as weed here.

I need advice...I know my boyfriend is strong but I hate that he feels the need to comfort me constantly, I feel so selfish.

TL;DR: I am a 21 years old female with MDD, BPD, and PTSD. I smoked weed daily but it was starting to get expensive and I was manipulating my BF into buying me more when I promised I'd take a break. I haven't smoked in 2 days and the symptoms from my issues have arisen to the surface again and possibly triggered an episode, now all I can think about is smoking again. Should I quit for good?",26Oct2018,1
91,"I don't usually talk about my feelings and thoughts but I really feel the need to address this and I'm afraid to do so with others personally. I'm a 22 year old who has been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder, OCD,  Social anxiety disorder  and Asperger syndrome. So awhile ago I was involuntarily hospitalized due to threatening to commit suicide, thank goodness the police officers were the coolest guys ever. I was in two community hospitals for about a month and a half. One of the things I've always had a problem with is obsessing over women. Women who have good hearts, are beautiful, and have the same religious views as me. I don't know too much about them and have only met them a couple of times, even some of them I have never met however since people basically describe themselves online on social media you get to know what they like, and the type of person they are plus the times you met and talked to them. I've only had a few girlfriends in my life and they weren't serious relationships. I would die for a serious relationship someone I could personally talk to about my problems, share my life with, go on hikes with, have a family with, to eat with, etc. I always fantasize about this with these women wishing I could be with one of them. I don't stalk them or anything, I don't know if constantly visiting their social media profiles or looking up their information is considered stalking or not. This bothers me so much that I become extremely depressed and start having intrusive thoughts again. Some of these thoughts are telling my self that I am worthless, that I should kill myself, and that these women would be afraid of me especially if they found out about my violent past and causes of my illness. I still have PTSD from the times I was violent in the hospitals. For some reason I also have thoughts about murdering them and them coming back to haunt me. I know that I do not want to do this and would never hurt them. Although I have these thoughts I am positive that I will not act on them because I know the repercussions and that life is a very precious thing. They just float in my head occasionally. Everyday it bothers me that I have nobody, that all my friends and family have someone, and seeing how happy they are, it's very depressing. I don't wanna talk about this with my family or my doctor &amp; therapist because I'm afraid of them drugging me up more, my family worrying about me or being ordered to be hospitalized again. I do not want to go back. I am a rather healthy individual and am doing so much better since I was released than before. I've learned so much since then. I have no idea what I should do.

92,"Hello guys, my mother has an extreme cleaning obsession-disorder. She cleans the whole house everyday, spends about 6 hours a day cleaning. She has the same kind of obsession with a junkie when the cleaning products are not there. It's not even funny. She gets extremely irritated if someone pours something on the floor.  
Well, the problem for me is that she spends all her money on cleaning products and keeps pouring them just like they were water. It's so extreme that my father pays for everything around the house.  
She is really caring, but this gets out of hand. I am 23 living with my parents since they don't have any money to let me go anywhere and i am still at university.   
Many of her friends have left her, since it's impossible to even talk logically with her. On the one hand she is my mother, but on the other hand, I have my own problems going on and  I can't afford to care.  
She is such a miserable woman and me being around her makes me miserable. ",26Oct2018,1
93,"maybe bipolar as well, but I genuinely think most of his most pressing issues can be explained by borderline personality disorder. he's only very recently, within the last few months, trying to go to therapy regularly and actually work on his issues as opposed to hiding, masking and self medicating them. I don't think his therapists thus far have been able to get a clear enough picture of his tendencies tbh.

he does have mood swings, but they're not typically days or weeks long, it's often hour to hour or even an extremely suddenly shift. always in response to something he perceives to be a threat to his self esteem or the security of his close friendships. I try to get him to talk to me about his feelings and what he struggles with as muh as I can, and from what hes told me, most of his emotional instability stems from near constant fear of abandonment and immense guilt over shortcomings in his past (lost jobs due to emotional instability, failed romantic relationships he's only recently trying to accept did not in fact fail because he ""wasn't good enough"", some insensitive and irresponsible actions during his years of drug dependency  [he's now sober] etc).

he's gotten so much better about certain things since I met him ~1.5 years ago (we were immediately compatible as excellent friends, feels like I've known him for a decade haha). he used to base his hope, dreams, life plans, even self worth and identity on the expectations of romantic interests, regardless of how incompatible they were or even how shitty, tbh, of a girlfriend the girl was. he'd do anything - overlooking infidelity, girls using him for drugs etc., attempting to change his core beliefs and identity to suit someone - to force a relationship to work, believing that if it failed he failed as a human being. about a year ago he, an ex-addict, pot-smoking bisexual atheist tried to force himself to become a conservative 100% heterosexual straightedge Christian for a girl he'd been speaking to for about a week. when the relationship failed, a month into knowing this girl, he was literally suicidal. this, from his own record, was a regular experience for many years.

he really has become so much more stable in this regard and I'm so damn proud of him. tbh, he and I would be dating now if we didn't both agree that putting a romantic label on ""us"" would complicate things and complications just simply aren't what we need right now. we call each other ""partners"". I think, though not labeled as romantic, this close of a relationship is still difficult for him to cope with - little things I do or say, or don't do or say, etc. sometimes throw him into hostile self-defense mode. he sometimes takes little things like my taking a few seconds to respond to a question as ""me lying trying to fabricate an answer"", an unemotional tone of voice when I'm tired or something as ""me being tired *of him* and not loving him anymore"" etc. most often I don't know the reason for his lashing out at me until later, it's usually a surprise in the form of him getting visibly nervous and angry with me - sometimes complete with verbal attacks and insults if it's really serious - with his anger typically dissolving into sadness and apologies within an hour.

he tells me that when something, even something he later acknowledges to be absolutely nothing - makes him feel like the security and stability of our ""partnership"" is threatened, even a tiny bit, he immediately, genuinely believes that I'm going to abandon him and he's going to be forced out of the house we share etc. etc.",26Oct2018,1

103,"A little background info: I’m a 20 y/o female. Diagnosed with depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD (inattentive kind) and Body Dysmorphic Disorder. 

So to attempt to make a long story short - I dealt with an episode of what I assume was psychosis (just by googling symptoms, not 100% sure) that started back in February and ended some time around April/May-ish. I was insanely paranoid that people around me were out to get me, was barely sleeping (maybe a few hours a night), barely had an appetite, kept seeing “signs” everywhere that I believed were from a “higher power” to confirm that people were actually plotting against me, was super irritable, made impulsive dumb decisions (like went in to get a face tattoo, tattooer wouldn’t do it bc I don’t have any other tattoos. So I left with a piercing on my face that I now hate lmao) - but also at the same time, all my insecurities (I have severe body dysmorphic disorder regarding my face, so I’m usually always extremely insecure) disappeared, I felt attractive for the first time in a *long* time + I felt like I was better/smarter than everyone else. Plus, I really just sounded insane - like, looking back at texts I sent to people during that time was beyond embarrassing. I would rant on and on about things that didn’t even make sense and just came off super narcissistic/rude which is typically the total opposite of how I am. I usually have 0 self esteem, so everyone was kind of like wtf. 

Anyway - I was acting so weird, my mom almost called to have me taken to the hospital because she couldn’t calm me down especially with my paranoia. Luckily, that didn’t have to happen and it eventually went away. I never sought help for it because I figured it was just a bizarre one time thing. 

But now I can feel it coming back again - I’m starting to only sleep a few hours, getting paranoid + really irritable, and the “narcissism” is kicking back in. I seriously don’t want things to get as bad as they were last time, I’m still trying to get over that embarrassment ha. So.. does anyone know what might be causing this? 

I know none of you can diagnose online, and I’m not asking for that; just hoping for any plausible ideas on what this is. I don’t really want to go back to a therapist because my last therapist was pretty much useless, then he ended up ghosting me anyway after several sessions without any explanation so I figured I’d ask the internet first before wasting more money lol.

I'm regrettably irresponsible, exhausted, cowardly, lonely, poor, in about 10K of debt, overly sensitive, and easily over stressed. I feel constant exhaustion, sadness, loneliness, desperation, panic, helplessness, and guilt. 

&amp;nbsp;

How would I go about finally just going on disability? I have diagnosed severe recurrent major depression and PTSD. I am afraid of going to my doctor who diagnosed the PTSD, because she has been urgently trying to get me to leave my (kind of formerly--I know this doesn't ever go away fully) abusive boyfriend, go to therapy, come in to see her for weigh ins(I have an eating disorder and lost 30lbs in a few months last year), get a job for some income so I can leave(so, I've worked at my new job for a month and still have no paycheck,and when I do it will be about $190).  This gives me anxiety even though I 100% know she's just trying to help and she's correct. She is also very positive and when I came to her last year with a form for food stamps, she was positive that I should have no trouble working. She was just upset that my bf doesn't pay for my food, but honestly our place is too expensive and he's in debt too. We have to find a new place. He does buy me food when he can. Regardless, I am my own responsibility.

&amp;nbsp;

I have always had depression and anxiety, but this worsened and the PTSD started almost 9 years ago now. I was always ambitious and stubborn and since I was a child, I was very independent and I was proud of that. I got a job at 18, immediately opened up a 401K(I later spent this on a gift), and handled my money well. Until the abuse and PTSD began. I feel crippled. I know I'm a moron for staying with an abusive bf, but at this point I don't feel like I even have an option. I am addicted to how I feel when he is good to me; it's over the top. I don't know how to be different and I'm afraid of everything. 
&amp;nbsp;

I got and quit about 8 jobs in the course of a few months when the PTSD began. Most of them I'd panic about and NCNS, then hide out in my room for a while afterwards. I had seasonal jobs a few times and those are the only jobs that worked for me, as they were non-committal and I didn't have to talk to anyone, ever really.
&amp;nbsp;

I know have arthritis in my spine, worsening numbness in my limbs, and almost constant sciatica. I can no longer work at a warehouse with heavy lifting. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like at this point, I need to just realize that I've tried for years and my problems are persisting because I am too afraid to leave my house, encounter people, and I am already overwhelmed so any stress from work puts me on overflow. I have considered suicide for a long time, but part of me wants to keep trying. I need a job or income for some sort of self reliance and to chip away at my old debts. 

&amp;nbsp;

How do I apply? What can I do? What would you do? I'm so confused and overwhelmed about what to do. I feel like disability is for people physically impaired or worse off than myself, I feel like a quitter, but I don't know what else to do.",26Oct2018,1

I get excited for the weekend, even though my weekdays are also very nice because the kids are in school and I have freedom to do what I want when I want and I can spend all day outside if I wish. Today, though, I feel more than a touch melancholy. I don't know...I did have an interesting day (I don't need to expand on that, now do I?) and it wasn't a bad day at all. In fact, I got to watch the railroad worker hook up a train to go a little north of the city (unhooking cars, hooking them back up, switching tracks) and I actually got to talk to him a bit too. We talked about the ""good old days"" (the 1970s and 80s) when we used to hop the trains and ride them for a mile or so, then hop back off and walk back home. This used to be common as catdirt in the town where I was raised. Things are different now, and I have no intentions on hopping a train (I am way too old for that nonsense), but it was nice to talk about it with the guy. It was so interesting watching him hook the airbrakes up and stuff...and when the cars came together (SLAM!!!!), it was SUPER loud. SO cool. I love being in a railroad area, and I am doubly lucky that I live about 2 blocks from where they do the hooking up of all the cars to the engines. :) That is the woods I speak of---it is techincally private property (railroad owns it) but up our way, they don't enforce it since it would cost a ton of money sealing off all the ways to get up there. Everyone uses the railroad tracks as a route to get to that shopping plaza since it is faster then taking the long way (it takes 5 minutes on the tracks compared to 15-25 minutes taking the road). They don't mind if you watch them doing their thing as long as you are respectful and stay back far enough. It is SWEET. I am super glad I live here.  


Well...this turned out to be a positive post after all. I smell coffee brewing (I am back on a coffee kick now that it is getting colder out) and I am about to go get a cup.

I was tempted to skip supper but I didn't. I ate and am full, and I am OK with it. So, that is all good for now.  


I just don't know why I am feeling a touch sad. It is probably because it is going to rain all day tomorrow and that means I can't go out and up to the woods to...you know...so I don't know what I will do when the urge hits.

110,"Hey everyone! My name is Bay and I live in Atlanta, Georgia, USA :)

I started a Youtube channel where I intend to discuss all things mental health, including my personal experiences, and other information from mental health professionals.

I'm typically a nervous gal, but I felt inclined to make a video and I just went and did it!

It would mean the world to me if you went and watched my first video, in which I discuss the attachment to a diagnosis :) 

Thanks guys!

111,"I'm 20 y/o uni student, two majoring in fine arts and philology. For 10 years now I've been dealing with depression and ptsd because of intense abuse I endured in childhood.  I'd rather think I'm doing well now, I've fought for the place in currently in, doing what I love, even though few years ago I almost might have lost it all. I walked through countless therapy sessions and have been on ssri now half of my life, but always learning and art was my coping mechanism, I was always passioned about learning new things and expanding knowledge.
Although for some time, the few last months, I feel like I've lost all the energy and interests I once had. I have classes for 10h or more every day and I'm doing what I have to do in university, but actually nothing makes me happy like it was before, and the constant exhaustion really made me close up and isolate from other people. Sometimes I don't feel like I'm able to form a coherent sentence, and the topics I was once passionate about now seem like a dark hole in my memory, where I can't recall a single thing from. Because of that my self esteem which I built for the last few years hit the iceberg, and I can see how it also affects my relationships with everyone. 
For the first time in years I've been getting flashbacks and stinging anxiety attacks for no apparent reason. And with that, I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to pursue my goals, but now it feels like I forgot what my goals even were because everyday seems like blackout. 
I need to snatch out of this mindset and get a kick in the ass, but I'm burned out to the point my mind is blocking any rational thoughts. 
Maybe someone could suggest me what to do, because I don't think I can manage like this any longer.",26Oct2018,1
112,"To my UK Mental Health Fam, we all know the services here and the NHS are in SUCH a state. So am I rn. 

I’m seriously suffering from Hallucinations, Delusions and serious mood swings. Got a diagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder off my GP (which suppose doesn’t count) BUT he isn’t ringing til Monday and I’m legit scared I’ll be too bad to be spoken to (he’s ringing and I’m convinced the government are tracking - fuck off Theresa May) 

Is there anybody out there who has managed to get themselves sectioned? 

It’s pointless going A&amp;E. I’ve been like 18 times already present with these symptoms and fuck all happens. My GP at Uni (no longer my GP) wanted me sectioned and even sent me with a note saying this. The student health place i went to once refused to let me go in fear of harming myself badly. 

I need serious help? Anyway I can forced being sectioned or anyway of getting some serious help? ",26Oct2018,1
113,"I quit both my jobs, dropped out of all of my classes. My mother looks at me like the biggest disappointment she has ever seen. I don't deserve to get well. I hate everything about myself. I self sabotage again and again. I don't want to be awake anymore. ",26Oct2018,1
114,"My friend (I’ll call him Sam) Sam came to my school a few years ago, he was really nervous and had an anxiety attack. I became really close friends with Sam and he didn’t seem like the person to have really bad anxiety so I shrugged it off. 

He is a really outgoing guy but he sometimes shy around people he doesn’t know, but nothing happened for a long time so I didn’t really think about his anxiety up until recently. 

Sam started having more sick days than usual and would shrug off why I asked him why he was off. Then we were having a messaging one arvo and he was said he had two anxiety attacks recently. 

I didn’t really know how to handle it and I felt like bad friend, so that’s why I’m posting here pretty much just asking for how to help him through this, he doesn’t like asking for help which makes it tough. What things can I do to make him feel more comfortable and to avoid these anxiety. Cheers ",26Oct2018,1
115,"Just over a year ago, I got into a really bad car accident (I got T-boned from the passenger side). Since then, I don’t drive at night, on highways, in the rain/snow, and not even in perfect driving conditions I still find myself afraid to drive not sure if the car at the stop sign will actually stop, I question if the light is really green and if it’s safe to go, etc. I’ve been at college for about 3 months more or less, and the last time I drove (two weeks ago) I found myself panicking. I don’t really know if I’ll ever get behind the wheel again, I really want to but I’m so scared, i tried seeing help but they tell me it’ll go away, I have family members who tell me I’m faking it or should get over, and my boyfriend is getting tired and annoyed about driving everywhere (were about 40 minutes away from each other by high way). I wish I could say I’m faking it, but I get behind the wheel and I feel paralyzed. ",26Oct2018,1
116,"I am going through something and I don’t know what it is... I have had a fairly stressful week...I live with my parents and we own a business together...they took a vacation leaving me to run the business and house along with my fairly new dog with separation anxiety (so I take her with me everywhere)... I was doing ok but I have been putting off some business work and it has sorta piled up and now I feel a little overwhelmed and inadequate...it seems like everything makes me upset or like I am doing something wrong... I enjoy so few things in life... I just feel like I am going through a repetitive cycle of wash rinse repeat... I don’t even think I did a good job articulating what I am going through... I should be pleased with myself... I have done everything at the business that needed to be done...but I have been staring at uncut fingernails and  haven’t showered in days maybe weeks... I just feel frustrated...things I have done that are good...

Dog didn’t die or go potty in house...
Gone to the business everyday and taken care of any or all issues that came up
Did some delayed/avoided work for store as well
The sink isn’t full of dishes
Started big work project almost half done


Things I feel bad about...

Haven’t walked the dog everyday...it’s cold out and I am always cold so not a good combination I did walk her most days
Didn’t do the laundry
Didn’t cut my nails
Didn’t shower
Didn’t cut hair
Didn’t vacuum the house
Didn’t take the recycling 

I just am feeling very apprehensive about my parents coming back...they would have taken care of everything I didn’t and will likely point out my shortcomings 😕

I don’t know if this is even a big deal... I have never attempted suicide nor do I think I am suicidal... I just feel kinda stuck while everything is zooming by me...

Just thought I would post hoping people can relate sometimes I don’t even think I have a mental illness I have been diagnosed with so many different things and taken so many medications I sometimes feel they are making me worse...and I see people in much worse shape then me yet here I am trying to be normal when I don’t know what normal is...",26Oct2018,1
117,Going on 8 years now. My depression has never subsided more than 6 months at a time. I've had a lot of positive happen to me situationally but nothing seems to help combat the depression for too long. I'm grateful for what I've been able to experience but I also feel as if I can't take the suffering anymore. I can't live this life cycling down into a deep suicidal depression multiple times a year. I'm tired of fighting.,26Oct2018,1
118,"So me and my friend were talking in class and he asked what I thought happened to a teacher we had a while back. I jokingly said he'd probably hanged himself by now, the joke being that this guy was the most miserable grouch ever. The teacher overheard it and gave me a lecture. Not fun.

Second one was probably worse. We were doing an assignment that involved cutting out small pieces if paper. These pieces were so small that I managed to blow them all over my friends table and onto the floor just by breathing. He said something like: ""What did you do that for?"". Me being the smart person I am thought the best thing to say was: ""I was breathing. You want me to stop breathing? Well, you have no fucking idea how much I would love to do that."". Of course the same teacher overheard that too. Fml.

I've been trying to sleep and can't stop thinking about this. R.I.P. my sleep schedule ~and probably my sanity~.",26Oct2018,1
120,"Yo, so I’m dying on the inside. I’ve been battling chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember. The few months have been horrible. I’m either clingy or disappear from people. I feel lonely 100% of the time and I only annoy people by existing. I have such paranoia that everyone is out to get me and I’m losing it. Do my friends want to leave me, do they want me to get out of their life, or do they want me dead? My family has been falling apart and it’s split down the middle, the half against me is sending me hate messages and threatening to hurt my family. I’ve had a panic attack almost every day for weeks. I was on 200mg of lamotrigine but called my psychiatrist and she immediately bumped me up to 300mg, and I also take two 20mg IR adderall. But nothing seems to work, I have trialed through all so many antidepressants, anti anxiety medications, and mood stabilizers. I see a therapist regularly but nothing seems to improve my mood for longer than a week. I want to kill myself or harm myself. I have razors sharp for slicing, too many medications to OD on and I have easy access to tall buildings where it only takes one step for me to kill myself. I don’t know how to cope anymore, no one listens and nothing has worked. I’m either crying from sad emotions, having a panic attack, or feel completely numb and okay with the idea of leaving this world. What do I do? Should I go to a hospital? Do I just give up and take my life to end my suffering? What will happen to my family? I’m a waste of time and money and I regret going to college because my parents have spent thousands on me for college, thousands on my mental health, and so much more. My paranoia of everyone and every situation is ruining me and I want to stop feeling horrible. What do I do?",26Oct2018,1
121,"It feels like im losing my mind more and more. Ive been crying alot lately and cant handle my thoughts. Im in constant discussion with myself and sometimes find myself talking to myself. I cried in front of my uncle (which is also my boss) and i feel like he is starting to think that im crazy. I feel like im not going to accomplish anything in life and feel like a complete shit for it. For all the work that everyone has put in for me and realizing it was all for nothing. I keep finding myself making the same mistakes over and over again and that i wont accomplish a thing this way.  Ive been thinking alot about suicide lately since it will probably be the least pain for the people i love in the long run. Surely they will feel pain in the beginning but they will get over it. All i will do the rest of my life is keep dissapointing them over and over again.

122,"My depression is the high-functioning autopilot type, but every now and then I'll experience low mood (to a point where I can be suicidal), sometimes I can have a vague idea why but not always...I certainly don't know how to work through this.   


I'm in therapy, intensive CBT, I assumed this would teach me these skills to deal with this but so far that's not the case.  


Does anyone have any practical solutions to help me understand and work through my feelings?",26Oct2018,1
123,"Lately, I haven't been wanting to be around people at all. I'm pretty introverted even on my good days, but on my bad days, I just don't want to be around anyone. My parents and boyfriend have been my biggest supporters and really hold me together. I love them so much and would truly do anything for them, but on my bad days, I really just nothing to do with them. I don't want to talk to them, see them, or even think about them. I just want to be in my own bubble, and I know that habit of just not wanting to interact or be around anyone is going to be really detrimental to my mental health. 

Not being around people makes me sad too. It makes me feel lonelier and my only company is my thoughts. It's this endless cycle of wanting to be with people because I know I'll be sad otherwise, but also just not wanting to be around anyone. 

Has anyone experienced this? Like this conundrum doesn't really make sense at all. How did you create a balance between socializing and giving yourself some time?
