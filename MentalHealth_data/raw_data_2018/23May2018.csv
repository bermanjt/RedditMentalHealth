0,"Hey Reddit, I'm posting this because I want to start a discussion and see if there is anyone else out there with similar experiences.

So this past year I've started noticing that I will just go through a week or even two and not even realize what I've been doing.  Like it's all just a blur to me.  
  I would say I'm somewhat of an alcoholic.  I drink 2 to 4 times a week.  But what really concerns me is when I have an extra long weekend or days off work.  I will binge on drugs and alcohol to the point where when I have to go back to work I have to really think hard about what the fuck I've been doing the past couple of days.  This feeling, or situation, happens even when I'm sober for a week.  Sometimes I just have to think back on the week and really question wtf just happened.
  It feels kinda like waking up from a raging night at a party where you got blacked out and only remember bits and pieces.  But instead of just one night it's like a whole week for me. It's like I was on autopilot and I wasn't storing memories properly or something.
  I also have a problem with urges to just fucking binge my guts out.  I can go about a week and a half of being sober and totally responsible and super productive.  Like I will be on my fucking a game, making shit happen.  But then one day I'll just be like fuck it let's get shwifty.  And I'll find myself cooked out, drinking and driving to a bar I don't even like to pick up crazy girls I don't even like.  It's like really destructive behavior but I feel like it's the real me that has to come out and play every once in a while.  
  Idk,. Should I be concerned about this.  Do y'all have similar experiences?  Plz let me know y'all's thoughts and questions.  And share stories too!",23May2018,3,

She also said I don't have it in me what it takes to succeed in industry. In various different ways she told me that I am a piece of shit. I am contemplating suicide but I know that i am not going to do it because i am a fucking coward. I feel i am so worthless that it will be fine if I don't exist.

4,"Some may have seen a post I’ve already posted about feeling upset about something I did online when I was 16. 
The reality is that every day there is something new that I worry about. Up until I was 17, I feel like I did really bad things. I bullied, I didn’t have any empathy, I had sexual feelings very early on so I’ve experienced many weird/disturbing sex things.
I know that this time of someone’s life is all about making mistakes, figuring out what not to do etc. But recently I’ve had reoccurring memories popping up into my head, and I feel like things I’ve done/been a part of are a lot more messed up than other people’s experiences. 
It makes me feel like I hate myself, like I’m undeserving of living even though most of these things happens years ago. It’s the whole idea that it was still technically ME who did it, therefore I’m a bad person.
I don’t know how to get rid of these thoughts. I can’t shake the feeling that if my family finds out or my friends or my boyfriend, I would be found as disgusting and unworthy (which is how I think of myself). 
I don’t know how to stop hating myself and move on with my life.",23May2018,2,

I have goals... I have a dream of who I could be if I could get out of this.  
But I've dealt with depression and anxiety for a long time. I enlisted because I wanted to follow this dream. I wanted to work my way up to and be the best that I can be. I wanted to do intel. I wanted to do OSI/NCIS...   
But sometimes our dreams don't work out like that... and I'm trying to hold on, and to be patient and to work hard...   
But I don't think I can hold on anymore. I dont think I can keep up with being this miserable and unhappy and lonely.   
I'm struggling constantly that I dont think I even want to be alive anymore if I keep feeling like this.  
Theres just so much going on in the world that I can't keep up with and that I dont understand and I feel utterly alone in this.  


And I know all of the coping techniques: healthy eating, 20 min of excersize a day, talking with friends, meditation, writing things down, picking up a hobby....its okay to cry.  


but what happens when your hobbies arent fun anymore? what happens when you feel like a failure because of them?  
what if you can't concentrate to write or draw or even sleep sometimes.  
what happens when you can't even bring yourself to get out of bed each day...  
when it feels like a miracle you even made it up to shower that morning and shit, maybe you even made your bed if nothing else..   
What happens when you feel like you've exhausted out all of your friends? When you push away those who are close to you?  
What happens when you are afraid to break them?  


What happens then? What happens when your dreams of being bad ass and or ever having a family comes crashing down?   
When you're afraid to live?",23May2018,3,
7,"Bit of backstory, me and my girlfriend have been on/off for a few months now. We've always felt so strongly about each other but a few weeks ago when we weren't together, she had sex with another person. In my mind, this has caused me to envision what happened between them when i close my eyes, including when we have sex. I absolutely hate these thoughts and make me feel anxious, depressed and on the verge of tears when they happen, but occasionally (mainly when sexual with my girlfriend) they become dominating and make me feel sexually aroused. After they've occured they make me feel even worse for feeling that way about them and it's genuinely horrible.

Im really confused as to whats happening. Should I tell my girlfriend about them? She has OCD and has told me about her struggles and I've stood by them understanding that it's a mental illness that she has obviously no intention to act on. I'm just really scared and confused",23May2018,2,

9,"A bit of backstory. My childhood was full of violence. Mother used to beat me up for anything till the age of 16. After I had to switch the school, I often got in fights in high school. I've been stabbed with a knife by a friend once and twice by two different girlfriends. My first sex was a sexual assault and I nearly vomited after that. 
Considering all this, I absolutely hate when people touch me. Even if it's somebody I know more or less.


Here is the question: how do I overcome this? Or at least show important people of mine that I really care for them and lack of physical contact isn't because I dislike them?",23May2018,3,

It's like...this is all a TV show\-\-\-or not even that. Because even a TV show is real to some extent. Maybe it's all a dream, and to wake up, I've got to kill myself. And when I wake up, I'll be in a real world. And it'll all make sense. 

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Nothing seems real. No one is real. I'm halfway convinced that everyone is just trying to keep me here. Like this is a trap. Maybe everyone's against me.

14,"For context, I will have to backtrack in my life, and I'm 16 for context.

My father and mother got divorced over ten years ago when I was still a little kid, and for a long time I didn't even realize why.

When I was around twelve, I had a moment of realization where I finally realized that ""My father is a fucking deadbeat.""

He wasted countless dollars on alcohol and cigarettes, is still living with his mother not who's become too numb to her childrens' insanity not because of an actual need, but because it's cheap and let's him play video games until it's four in the morning without worrying about responsibility, and while he eagerly threw money at me and my brother, he treated my older sister like she was a complete hassle to even think of dealing with.

I stopped going to ""his"" house several years ago save for holidays out of family courtesy and to visit my great grandparents, two complete saints who this piece of shit never deserved, and always kept myself emotionally distant from him.

About four months ago, my great grandmother died, and I wasn't told until a week after she had died. Since then, I've been in a constant state of bitterness and anger at him. That woman was a complete goddess of kindness and love and I couldn't tell her goodbye. When we tried to visit my great grandfather, an uncle tried to reason by saying some bullshit about the neighbors not even knowing.

When I finally looked at him, I couldn't speak. My heart was pounding and my eyes were literally being clouded with rage, I didn't hear my mother and grandmother talking, I didn't hear the video my cousin was watching on his tablet right next to me, all I could see and hear was him.

I've always had a temper and will often bottle up my anger and sadness to not affect other people around me, but this was a rage I couldn't just repress and move on.

Yesterday I snapped, screaming at my sister and brother for something completely stupid and small, and have been stuck in a blank state since but still feel my anger growing. At this rate I'm genuinely scared I might hurt someone around me out of a lapse in judgement or rashness. Should I confront him and that side of my family, or should I keep quiet about it?",23May2018,1,

17,"Hey, does anyone know how I can overcome this? because my family definitely doesn't have money for any kind of help. This is also really venty, so if you dont have any help, it's not a big deal.

Recently I've felt like I'm being watched by fictional characters, \(I know, makes no sense\) buts its gotten to the point that I really start to feel like they're there, watching me, and judging what I'm doing, it's gotten so bad that I won't get up from where I'm sitting, or do something I think they'll find stupid, or weird.    

If I go sit where I think they are, I genuinely feels like I'm invading their space, and that I'm in them or something, its really messing with me, I keep telling myself that it isn't real, that its absolutely nuts, but it wont work, no matter what i do I can feel them sitting on that bed, or wherever they are. 

Also having problems with what might? be OCD, every since I was young, I'd count up to certain numbers on my palm, \(until it was a *good* number\) only step in certain places, step a certain amount of times so its either an even number, or a number I don't think is bad, things have to be shut off a certain amount of times, and closed a certain way. But recently, it's gotten worse, to the point that it's part of my everyday life. 

When I was younger, my \(now deceased\) alcoholic dad would abuse my mother, throwing things, yelling, hitting her, etc. 

I once watched her be choked

and I think it might have messed me up, I can't handle doors slamming, or being yelled at. my mom has gotten a boyfriend now, but the thing is she only introduced him to us once, and he moved in like two days after, and idk, it was just very uncomfortable.

I'm also very frustrated with her because of our schooling, we where homeschooled, but even when my dad was alive she'd be pretty flaky with teaching us, and now, nearly 7 something years of absolutely ZERO schooling, she's decided to pick it back up. \(*After saying she would multiple times over the years\)* and I don't know a lot of things! like basic math, and whatever the hell else you learn in school, it makes me feel very stupid, and I know I should teach myself, but I don't have the motivation for that, what 15 yr old does? Just the fact that she neglected us for so long makes me so upset, and where we where living? a trailer, \(not necessarily a bad thing!\) but it was terrible, after my dad killed himself our house just FILLED with trash, too the point that my mom, and all of my siblings slept in the living room for multiple years, I had no friends, no contact with anyone outside of our family, and she did not handle her money well, always saying we'd move, but instead, going and buying things for the garden she barely kept alive, we lived in absolutely horrid conditions, and had a pile behind the couch of our clothes, we'd wear the same dirty clothes for MONTHS until she went and washed some, and I mean EVERY clothing item was dirty, it was truly horrendous. After cancer took our baby brother is when I think everything exploded, when my dad's depression worsened, and when my mom stopped caring.

It was, and to a certain extent IS so terrible, I feel like she's stripped my entire young childhood from me, it makes me wonder how she could have even loved us with the way she acted,  she's so flaky and yells over the smallest things! its so frustrating. tell me, was this neglect? 

I know the abuse definitely effected her, but does that excuse the things she's done, and HASN'T done?

I can't find the motivation to do things, and until recently I would self\-harm. I don't shower until it's absolutely necessary, or really take care of myself, I think I might be depressed?

This part might sound a little nuts, but I think I might have been raped and don't remember it, I've thought about it jokingly multiple times, but when someone on a subreddit said it had happened to them, I teared up, and got a feeling that it may be true, but I can't access impossible memories, and a part of me keeps doubting myself, and that I might just want something to be wrong with me.

I feel like my life wasn't really that bad, and I'm overreacting.

Thanks if you took the time to read this shitstorm, and any advice whatsoever would be very appreciated.

18,"\[M25\] I haven't really had a girl in my life since my mid\-teens. What I'm dealing with:

* Lack of self\-esteem due to my face, and size of my ""boy""\-hood. 
* When ever I see an amateur video of people having sex , sometimes I'll be turned on, sometimes I'll get a wave of despair because I think it's something I'll likely never experience. At least with ""professional"" porn, I know it's mostly fake, but with ""amateur"", it's more real. And my despair comes from the fact that this ""realness"" is something I may never experience. 
* I'm worried that looking at attractive people \(in SFW and NSFW situations\) has raised my expectations too much. I think I need to ground myself more with reality, and accept my looks and my size. **How can I do this without going into depression?**  
* My self\-esteem issues also come from other factors, but I feel like at the root of it all is my physical body \- my face and my little dude below.

20,"I guess I could say I'm conflicted regarding my feelings about this, and I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I needed to get this out somewhere and maybe get a couple perspectives about my feelings.

I'm a 16 yo female at a public high school, and I have had this teacher for the past three years. As of late I've started to notice that I feel what I could best describe as an obsession/sort of infatuation for this teacher that I feel is interfering with my day to day happiness. I won't disclose what subject he teaches, but let's just say it's a subject that I happen to be very avid in and display particular talent in, because of many years of participation outside of school. Because of my decently large background and enthusiasm for the subject he teaches, compounded with my inclination to converse and joke my with teachers, I've always received a special sort of attention from him. I guess it's almost inevitable that this happens between teachers and their enthusiastic students- his subject can expand to a few particular areas we share mutual interest in, and it's not one tons of HS kids come along with interest in, so that really paved the way for one-on-one interactions between us, even among larger groups of people. 

We have discussions, lighthearted arguments, lots of exchange of banter and stupid inside jokes. To compound this, we share interest in things even beyond his subject, things like philosophy, so we end up with a ton of points of discussion and I feel like it's led to him ""understanding"" me particularly well. Our interactions happen both in class and in two extracurricular groups he conducts that I take part in which allow for us to see each other pretty regularly. Sometimes we'll even exchange banter and memes via a class reminder app that basically allows texting between student and teacher (nothing inappropriate, this sort of interaction is pretty limited, you get the idea). 

Bottom line, we have this rapport by nature of few different things but it's becoming problematic because I've become dependent on receiving attention from him to feel happy, and I think it's very unhealthy. If a class goes by where he doesn't acknowledge me in some way, I sulk away for the next few hours and impatiently wait for the next time we'll meet. I reroute my walking to even just pass by his room in a way that forces him to see me walk past, almost as a reminder that I'm here, a way to insure I pass through his head (ugh, I feel grossed out with myself writing this out.) I orient myself in a way that makes it more likely he'll start a conversation with me, and when he doesn't I just feel really...sad. Like he's all that matters. So basically I'd almost say it's a ""crush"" but the romantic feelings feel less ""I love you"" and more ""I absolutely crave attention from you and I can't explain why."" It's confusing because I do not find him physically attractive, and he's not objectively attractive, but I've still thought of him sexually (in the role of partner, paternal figure, and a sort of hybrid of both.)

I've thought and read a lot about this, and based on what I've found, I seem to parallel some experiences of girls with ""daddy issues"" - so craving paternal attention one didn't get from their father. My dad is buy and large normal and stable albeit with some paranoia and a short temper, and he's always been in the picture, but I guess I'm ambiguous as to whether I've always gotten a ""normal"" level of emotional support from him. As a kid got (and still get) ALL my emotional support solely from my mom, like I can't recall having nearly any emotional conversations with my dad, so I wouldn't call it distance, necessarily, he's just never been the kind of person I confided in because that always came from my mom. As for physical contact, maybe not that much but again idk what the standard is. Basically I don't really know what level of confidence with my dad would be considered normal or would cause me to seek attention from this guy (who, for more reference is in his forties, so a bit younger than my dad, and is married with a kid.)

I'm sorry for the length and sorry if this is in a weird place... I guess i'm just wondering what adults would suggest as the cause of obsessive feelings for a teacher. Could it be something unresolved with my dad? How can I focus my attention more healthily? Why do I care so much about how this guy views me?",23May2018,2,

23,"Whether you have it yourself or are close with someone who does, I would really appreciate some guidance. 

I am a co-captain of a recreational soccer team and we have recently had a new player join our team from the leagues free agent list. He's a solid player and a nice guy, if a bit odd. So far so good, he gets along well with the team and we are happy to have him. On our teams shared page after the first game he played with is, he misunderstood our other captains follow up message to the team about communication, and responded with a very long and a bit too personal series of comments. Among those comments he mentioned that he has schizophrenia. It was no big deal and no one made it one, but it was a very out of the blue series of comments and none of us really knew how to respond. 

So far, 5 games in, we have simply been treating him as if that never happened and just trying to treat him like one of the guys, and it's going well. But before tonight's game my boyfriend walked in on him talking to himself with a very serious tone. It was a bit off putting because my bf has never encountered someone with this type of illness and because we don't know him at all, we don't know what his actual situation is in terms of treatment, symptom management, etc. 

I know that the obvious thing to do is to not make a thing about it and to continue to treat him normally, but I also want to know how I can better gauge whether he is doing ok or not and when/whether there is cause for concern. I also would like to know where to draw the line between treating him like everyone else and making sure we don't create stress or misunderstanding for him (as we all tend to rib each other a lot). I don't want to make him feel left out or like he is treated differently, but I also don't know if the wrong comment might be taken seriously and cause stress.

I hope I'm not coming across as ignorant or judgmental. I just do not have any experience with this type of illness and I want to be prepared to handle any situation that might come up.

24,"Hi , this is my first Reddit account . I am 24 years old , and all through out life especially as a teen , I knew something was off about me . I was told a lot that I was weird , over dramatic , a basket case , and would just act irrational over little things . I never noticed it , I was always in denial I guess , if someone was to point it out to me , I would get defensive and think they were attacking me . To make a long story short,  here recently I was spiraling out of control mentally . I was ripping my hair out (trichotillomania) and self mutilating and also some days be bubbly and full of energy (manic) and then wanting to just die (depression) I never noticed any of that , to me it was normal . It got so bad that a very close friend of mine took me in and had me admitted to a mental health institute because I was just going to kill myself , I was going to swallow my whole bottle of Xanax.   After being in the pshyc ward for a week, I was diagnosed with bi polar 1 / manic depressive . This was obviously news to me , I didn't know anything about bi polar for that matter . They put me on mood stabilizers and now I've been on them for about a month , and I am slowly starting to see a difference . And since I've been diagnosed , I've done research and everything , it makes so much since to why I have acted in the past , it's all come together like a puzzle . It is emotional to me in a way because I know now that before when I was having ""my moments"" it really wasn't my fault and I went so long thinking I was weird , crazy , and wondering what the fuck was wrong with me and now I know . I can tell now also , well kind of , when I'm manic , so I am seeing a slight difference and starting to notice . When I am manic , I stay up all night long coming up with great ideas , listening to music , and any other random tasks that seem unnessisary thats late at night , such as wanting to bake cookies to painting my nails at 3 AM lol and feel fine the next day . Before , I just thought,  ""okay , I just won't sleep,  I'm just like that sometimes and I'll catch up on sleep later"" so basically what this long post is saying , if you think you may have an illness or if friends and family believe you are Ill,  then listen to them . It's life changing , get some help and you are not alone . It took me going to a pshyc ward . You can avoid that by listening to your loved ones and see a psychiatrist.  I know now that I'm not insane , I am just ill and in recovery . I still have manic days , that will always be something I will live with but the meds will manage that more . Wish all of you the best if you are going through the same . ",23May2018,8,

It affects me in many ways, I can’t complete simple tasks due to it affecting my memory, focus and ability. It also affects me physically and I have no energy. I’ve suffered for many years and it’s affected working. I have worked full time since leaving school, I would always get pulled up in work about my performance and on many occasions I would be late due to oversleeping when having a depressive episode. I often have panic attacks too so completing tasks in work would cause me to have them.
I don’t currently work and I’m living off the last bits of money I have.
Each health professional have advised me to visit citizens advice and work out what I’m entitled to. The GP said it’s highly unlikely I’d cope working full time due to how severe it gets. 

Does anybody have any clue what I’m entitled to and how to sort it?

The last few times I admitted myself they even stated that they wouldn't take care of them as they don't feel as if it's their responsibility. It's shitty, I know, and at the same time, I know that they (my family) and their lack of support and empathy towards the way I am is partially the reason why I feel the way I feel. Besides that, it has also been my inability to support myself, find a job, not having friends, low self-esteem, legal issues I'm currently facing, and lingering major depression from when my brother passed away almost 7 years ago. 

This feels like a hard decision and I don't know what to do and I'm very scared and stressed either way. What should I do? :(",23May2018,1,

41,"I will put the short version here  
In case anyone knows if it is possible to have a sudden ""breakdown"", quotations because I don't know how to call it, and suddenly feel apathy towards everything, I beg you, please let me know what should I do because I can't take it anymore.  


Now for the long version.  
I've been with my long distance girlfriend for almost 2 years and we saw each other few times a year. Everything was going great until about 1 month ago. She has one of those ""shitposting"" accounts on facebook where she just shares random stuff, memes and light erotica. 1 month ago she had a talk with her mother about safety on the internet and she got angry because her mom told her to change a word she used in a status she shared on her main account because it wasn't appropriate. That's when all began. Suddenly she wouldn't message me that often anymore and a week or 2 afterwards she started acting even verbally aggressive. Now I can't say I was the good sheep. In the beginning I was supportive of her. No matter what she said or how often she messaged me I didn't change my behavior and kept praising and supporting her. This lasted about one week. I started thinking that maybe she got exams and all that so I didn't message her that often either and as I was pissed off she was acting dry, I too acted dry. 2 weeks or so went on in this shitty situation.

Later she told me she was in an argument with a class mate and from one point she felt overwhelmed by apathy and could no longer feel any sensation attached to words she was saying. She said this lasted a long time and I think that maybe it still comes up from time to time. And this would be the thing I'd be most interested in. Is there any disorder that does this??? She had a really stressed period with exams and all so I guess that was also a factor but idkkkk. This happened about 1 week or so after she opened the account. When she first told me I didn't know, I thought it happened before the opened the account but afterwards she told me it happened after and then it clicked me that the first week when she wasn't talking to me but interacting with others didn't overlap.

And another thing that really destroyed me somehow. Ever since she started posting on that useless account, lots of times when she was sharing soft erotica, there were 2-3 pricks commenting in a sexual manner and she even heart reacted and replied to them in a somehow positive manner. And even in good times, when I would send or say something erotic, almost every single time she would get angry and she rarely initiated some kinky talk but whenever she would do it, every single time she would do it, would be when I was angry, drunk or stoned, never once when we were both in a good state.

I was thinking that maybe it was all a mental thing, mental health is no joke, maybe something flicked in her brain from that sudden apathy episode. But I don't know, I was seeing she was interacting with other people while simply ignoring me or treating me with complete blandness/aggression. On top of that I don't see how she could find comfort there, I was always supporting of her, always praising her, until the last month I don't think there were 2 days in a row without a cute good night message and a cute good morning one, have a nice day and all that after she fell asleep so she can read in the morning and put on a smile and rock it. And it wasn't even overwhelming, when silence was needed, it was offered.  

Also to make some things clear. I have no intention to keep her ""chained"". I always told her to go out, have fun, meet with friends, all that. But there is a difference when you chose one over another and completely ignore the other side. And breaking up is the last thing I wanna do, I love every single atom of her being and I just want her to come back

42,"I woke up this morning like I do many mornings with thoughts flooded with all the people who hate me, or treat me like crap, and all of the times in my past where I've embarrassed myself and/or been humiliated or defeated...it really is staggering how much evidence there is that I'm just a repulsive personality. I forget things, can't seem to do anything right...you know, same old story.

I've really been trying, and some days doing pretty good at staying connected to reality and not letting depression, anxiety, manic highs over take me. But all of that regret, self loathing, resentment, fear, etc is bubbling away just beneath the surface and when it swells up....damn.

I barely know what to say. I'm just trying my best to articulate what i think the problem is, but there is inevitably so much of my messy inner experience that I can't really translate in to words (I don't think I'm special in this, it's just part of being human I think).

I feel so useless sometimes. I blurt stupid things out, say awkward, weird, mumbly things. I laugh when people mock me instead of hit back or at least do something that shows self respect. I struggle to remember things. I haven't accomplished much in my life. There seems to be something fundamental missing. Some kind of lynch pin, some kind of capacity for a consistent through line that well adjusted people have seems to be missing in me. I could also be over complicating things, but that last thought is pretty deep seated and ""just changing my thoughts"" doesn't seem possible with that particular thought.

Bah. I don't know. Just sick of my mind rehashing all of these wounds, these reasons to hate myself and be afraid. I hate spending so much time focused on things that don't matter when I've had moments where I am free of such nonsense and realize what a waste of time it is to ruminate like I do. I know something better is possible...but my mind is so easily triggered back in to self loathing territory.

43,"In April I tried to hang myself in the bathroom door using a handcrafted leather belt which was adorned a worn brass buckle. The buckle held, the belt held, my mind screamed for me to stop but I had no control. I hung against the bathroom door internally screaming as my vision went dark. 

All I could see was a pinhole of shrinking white light. I pleaded with myself, begged to not go out like this. My knees listened and supported my weight right before the pinhole completely went away. Three days later I tried again in the same way with the same end result. 

A trip to the ER happened. A psychiatrist happened. 75mg of Wellbutrin twice a day happened. A new full time job, the first since 2013 happened. I finally became aware of why I’m crazy. Why I sabotage my life. Why I have hardly any friends or family who talk to me. 

For years I was up and down-manically so. Now I am alone. I get up. I get coffee. A shower. I take multi vitamins, vitamin D, Wellbutrin. I brush my teeth. Do my stretches. Do 20 sit-ups, 10 crunches, 20 push-ups. Drive to work. Work. Come home. Work some more. Try to reach out to friends and family. 

I was always the one listening to their problems and trying so hard to be helpful. Clinical empath. Can’t do anything for me except suicide. That’s the one selfish thing I get to do but I can’t. 

I’ve got a kid. A marvelous, fantastic child. But only see him 4 days a month. Divorced my wife after she became a stripper, then prostitute, then got into a heavy relationship with her pimp. My ex wife is a whore and that’s literal. I hate that I can say that. My son does not know. 

Because I was a stay at home dad with no money I lost. Her and her pimp now husband like money and can give him a better material life. Does not matter that she’s diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. She can’t help her self she can’t get treatment a result she abuses our son and everyone else. I accept her for who she is. 

She had a son when I met her. I raised him from 6months to a month before his 6th birthday. I haven’t been with him since. The court wants me to see him but she won’t allow it. I hear about him thru my son. He’s angry and has been taught to hate me. He hates me. I love and miss him so much. His loss never gets easier. 

None of the losses ever get easier. 

Last year before medication, before awareness I decided to do good things for myself. Got a part time job. Got fired for being dyslexic. Got another painting walls and houses. Got into the best relationship with someone I truly love. Life got good. 

Then surgery for my stomach issues. Then quitting the gabapentin cold turkey. Painful healing. Realizing my girlfriend was still in love with her ex. Writing a book in a manic week while off and on Adderall, marijuana, nicotine, and caffeine. Hardly any sleep. 

Tried to tell my girlfriend that we needed to take a break so she could get over her ex-boyfriend. I was just a rebound relationship, she only wanted me for a fling. Prior to her I have been single for six years. I had really wanted. Tried to tell her things instead told her I was going to kill myself when I finished the book completely. 

Belt. Bathroom. ER. 

Now I am here. About to leave for my weekly therapy. Alone. Last night an old friend reminded me of how toxic I was when I was unaware and unmedicated. All of my friends and family have delighted in finally being able to scold me for having an illness. For being so toxic. 

Falllout. 

I want to kill myself. But I can’t. 

I’m a hollow man who survives for his son. I’m also a bestselling author. The only way people have ever accepted me is thru my books. But I’m toxic. Hollow. Surviving.

They are a mental health charity that offers information and support to people suffering from mental health issues and works to empower people to understand their condition and the choices available to them. Mental health issues are so common, yet so many people still suffer on their own. I personally have been helped by this charity, they have always provided useful information on the issues I face and pointed me in the direction of the best help available. I think the work they do is amazing and I want more people to be aware of it! I felt more support through the Mind website than I did from any of my doctor appointments so far. 

The reason I chose to do a skydive is because it terrifies me. When I remember that I have to fall from a plane in two months time it makes me freeze up and want to back out. Like with so many other day to day events or simple plans that cause me to panic and want to hide away and shut down. I know I can't though, and that's the point, you can't suddenly switch off mental health issues or make them go away. But its every small step you take to make things better that makes the difference (or one big jump in this case) and if me facing a fear makes even the smallest difference then I will be happy with that.

1 for any one with mental illness I would suggest stay away from straight sativa strains because they are known to cause high levels of high anxiety and paranoia and is known to cause psychosis in some mentally ill patients(only when high tho)
2. Another reason why the indica strains are the way to go is because with a lot of these mental problems it's hard to kick back and relax and that's what the indica strains are known for
3. If you are on medication DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE SMOKING I've known people who have just been wasting money on their medicine cause they smoked and the weed just made it useless... (anti depressants are the ones if you are on you might want to read up on the effects of thc and the medication your on)
4. NEVER smoke out in public find I safe spot (hopefully inside your house) where you can kick back relax and have a good time....
5. Don't over do it you need to be able to cope and have it effect you when you aren't high

As I found nothing enjoyable in my life coping wasn't really easy for me but it helped me enjoy stuff like video games to help me cope... and now I'm on the road to mental stability I am now off my anti psychotics and I feel great....

64,"### “Why do people seem to dislike me before they interact with me?”

I know this answer makes you want to groan, but people dislike you because you think people dislike you. Tough to grow when you start from that perspective.

Just like you, that cashier is living in her own world. Day after day she helps hundreds of boring and crappy people. Chances are, that person in front of her broke through her wall somehow.

Perhaps the person in front of you made a joke, complimented her dress, or just said hello with true kindness. Sometimes we do this to women with a goal of seduction, and of course that doesn’t work half as well.

Just start chucking little stones out there at people’s walls. We are all hurting and angry and bored. We show that to the world in different ways.

But we are all so grateful when someone peeks their head over our walls and says hello. Try that more often. Ask someone for the time because your phone is dead, and then compliment them on something and walk away forever. No pressure, no goal.

Have fun building this skill over and over, because when you heal yourself enough and get enough “stones” in your arsenal of experience, you can walk up to cashiers like this and destroy their entire wall with your trebuchet \(gotta insert them memes\).

You can bring happiness to the sad, and excitement to the bored, but not until you destroy your own walls first.

### “I feel stuck in a purgatory between childhood and adulthood”

What you wrote as your title is infinitely more important than the details you dived into, like homework.

To realize something like that is wonderful, and means you’ve taken a step in development from “unconscious incompetence” \(not knowing what your doing is ineffective\) called “conscious incompetence” \(knowing what your doing is ineffective\). Awesome!

The next steps are “conscious competence \(switching into working hard doing what is effective\) and after that, unconscious competence \(effortlessly doing what is effective after practice and mastery\).

I would focus more on higher level change like that, seek out psychology and philosophy that will help you continue to grow. Our world doesn’t give us the steps anymore, unfortunately. It’s up to you.

Now, as practical advice, use Kaizen to get your shit done. It’s the art of small daily improvements over time that lead up to huge results.

Write just one paragraph of that paper, and then stop. If you can get started way ahead of time, you could potentially write one paragraph in the morning each day for a month, and have a 15 page paper done.

It’s all about breaking up bigger goals into smaller tasks. Get as small as you need to for you to get moving, because it takes much more energy for an object as rest to start moving than it does to keep moving.

Same with nutrition: Don’t change everything at once. Switch just your breakfast for now into a perfect nutritious meal, because we usually have a ton of willpower at the beginning of the day. Do this for a month, then move into lunch, then dinner.

Good luck!

### “How do I change from being someone who’s “boring to talk to” to someone who’s “interesting and fun to talk to?”

I always did the “ask questions instead of talking” thing too, which is like the classic social conversation advice. That works unless all you can do is ask questions, which is where I felt comfortable. I didn’t feel comfortable talking about myself.

The only right way to do this, without all the lame tips and tricks that never make you feel safe, is to become interesting and fun. Both in the real world, AND in your own mind. When I got OUT of my OWN DAMN HEAD and just started paying attention to others and the real world, it was so much easier.

Because when you are in line at a coffee shop talking to someone, maybe a cute girl, endless questions is just interrogation. But if you are relaxed, in the moment, and just trying to have fun connecting to another human you can make jokes about the menu items, talk about how one time you drank 8 coffees and tasted colors, or something funny you saw walking to the shop, just people watching.

That’s all WE want to talk about even, that’s how you stay safe and connect with people. Talk about the world around the both of you like you are on the same team.

Finally, I used to react that way too. I was overreacting, reacting too quickly, just trying to be liked. I see it in my friends now too that I’ve stopped it, they start laughing before I even finish the joke and its kind of frustrating. So if you are uber\-reacting to people thinking you are connecting, you are really coming off as an actor.

It takes courage, but actually react. Instead of going “holy cow, wtf!” when someone says, “you won’t believe what my cat did today, pooped on the floor”, take a breath and actually stop and think if this is really worth a “holy cow, wtf”. It’s not, so then you can think about how you actually want to respond instead of waiting to be liked by giving positive affirmations.

You’d go, “Lol, well thanks for updating me on your cat’s bowel movements! Keep me posted!” and now suddenly your a valued member of the conversation by proving that your not just there to get dumped on \(not me and not you, but some people just love to ramble and get words out, and look for easy targets to do so\).

So much more to discuss here but hopefully this will help kick off some ideas.

### “How many of us here are actually disciplined? Is this sub the blind leading the blind?”

I’d say I’m pretty disciplined, but it’s not really discipline anymore, like others are saying. I ENJOY it. I feel worse when I DON’T do these things, and they aren’t too stressful for me.

It’s so great how everyone is saying, “Yes, I am disciplined here but not here”. You’re not supposed to be this god among men. You are supposed to be the best version of YOU, not the best version of a human. If you hate reading and have always hated reading, why are you trying to force that? Watch a documentary a week instead.

I use Google Sheets to run my two startups, my life and errands, my network, my budget, and more. That system saves my life. I’m in decent shape and eat well \(plants &amp; animals, nothing more to it\), I could definitely do better with my meditation and learning…

It’s great coming here and hearing other individual’s strategies and struggles. We’re all in this together!

### “I can’t stop idealizing this woman. Need some perspective on this.”

Hey man, I wanted to point you to one gigantic flaw with this woman:

She doesn’t like you.

Sure, she checks all your boxes for the ideal wife, except for the simple fact that she has no interest in you! What a crummy partner that would make.

Focus on getting your self\-esteem up, and one day you will realize how silly this obsession is. You can’t think your way out of it right now, so work on yourself.

Good luck, here for ya!

### “I’m 54, got a low paying job, no wife, no girlfriend, not more than 2 friends, and it’s pretty lonely.”

I wish I had all the time time in the world to talk to you, but I’m headed out the door. My mother and stepfather recently moved out to Texas, and found this place called Hill Country Youth Ranch. It’s 50 acres with 10\-15 cabins, and they take care of young boys and girls who have been abused or abandoned. The man who founded it is a good man, and he has been doing this for decades.

My parent’s can’t get enough, and they are house parents to a group of kids. They teach them to clean up, take them to town to play, bike around the ranch with them, and have real conversations when things get rough. They are parents to kids who never had them.

I might want to encourage you to look into something like this. There is nothing more noble and heartwarming. You’ll be able to have kids. You’ll be able to constantly be around other great people and close friends, your other volunteers. You get paid to be a houseparent too.

Wherever you are, there is something like this. You might just find a woman there who shares your same values and maybe you live the rest of your life together, who knows, but that’s not the point. I truly hope you think about pursuing a route like this. Shoot, let me know if you want to be connected with HCYR. They are always desperate for help.

### “How do you deal with the overwhelming feeling of having so much to do, that you just sleep/avoid it all together?”

It’s almost not even that… It’s breaking down either one of those into something so stupid simple you get the ball rolling. Taking an object from no movement to any movement takes a lot of energy, keeping it moving is easier with momentum.

If you have to do laundry \(easy\), all you have to do is get up from bed and put it all in the bin. Flop back down if you have to, but chances are just that little bit of movement totally breaks down that inner barrier, and you’ll put the load in the wash anyway.

If you have to find a new place to live \(hard\), just go online and write down three phone numbers of places you might like to look at. You don’t have to call. But with the paper in front of you and the computer up you might just go for it and schedule a tour anyway.

### “I want to completely change myself, but I’m unable to. I waste all my time.”

Hello my friend.

Sucks you’re feeling this way. I was there about 6 months ago. It’s pretty painful, and what I’m about to tell you probably won’t stick, because the way your brain is running right now is just completely negative in terms of polarity or energy. The things I believed about myself were 100&amp;#37; true 6 months ago, and 100&amp;#37; untrue now that I am in a more positive state. So, as I try and give you some advice below, try to use the word, “Maybe” instead of “No way.”

So, maybe you’re not a piece of crap. Maybe you have a ton of hope and potential but you’re just stuck in the pit. Google the allegory of the cave by Plato. When you’re so deep in this mind\-state, it’s impossible to see things as they really are. It’s chemical. And it can change through painful transformation and work.

The first red flag I saw was, “I want to completely change myself.” No one could get out of bed with a goal that huge, and it’s impossible anyway. You need to focus on Kaizen: Small daily improvements over time that add up to big results. If you just start walking down the street and back once a day for this entire week, in 5 years you’d be an absolute beast of physical strength, because you would slowly build on that habit and evolve.

You need hope, a lifelong goal that you can tie yourself to. You ARE a warrior, but you are dormant and untrained and unconfident. And a warrior without hope just stays in that pit with nothing to do. What is that really cool thing you could never do today, but maybe a long way off? Is that degree a huge source of pride? Do you want a great job, or be in great shape, or a great family? Ignore your brain, which will try and tell you everything you just thought of is stupid. It’s not. Think lower, with your heart. It feels a little different, I promise.

It’s really tough to get off the computer or focus on productive things without that big piece of hope. Humans only make change for two reasons, to avoid pain or to gain pleasure. Avoiding pain is more motivating. So, you’re close my friend. You’re angry and frustrated at yourself, and you’re in pain, and you’re about to change. I promise. Embrace it, fight every single day. Turn the computer off and walk outside, even if you know you’re going to walk right back in and turn it back on. Just put in the effort.

The final toughie: Comparing yourself to others, “I’m so far behind.” It seems so stupid when someone tells you not to compare yourself, when we have real life metrics like friends and likes and money and power to prove how good we are. But it’s all insecurity and selfishness. You are exactly where you are supposed to be right now, because no one else has been you or been through your path in the history of the world. Be yourself.

Learn to LIKE yourself. There’s a huge difference between hating these bad habits and hating yourself. Be like the football coach who screams at his team to improve because he loves them deeply. Don’t be the like the bully who screams at people to bring them down.

I hope something in here helps you. Go create a new account with a better user name \(It was something like ‘isuckbad’\). The words you use to describe yourself and repeat to yourself are extremely powerful, and there’s so many people in the world trying to bring us down anyway, we don’t need to help.",23May2018,0,

71,I’ve been going through a lot of stress at work and I resigned my position...I have one week left. I’m scared of the uncertainty of what’s next. I think it’s the source of my anxiety but my relationship is making me anxious too. I love my bf and everything is going great but I’ve developed this fear that he’s going to break up with me. I’m basically happy when I’m with him and unhappy when I’m not. I hate the feeling and I don’t know what to do. ,23May2018,1,
72,"Today didn't start off different, but it's been exhausting for no real reason. I got up late, happens occasionally, and my partner was anxious about getting to work on time. I had to plan on coming back home to get myself ready for my job. Instead I sat and cried for so long.

I'm not disappointed I'm stressed. I'm surprised I am at a point where I am so very affected by it. Just regular stiff happening, then this left hook. 

I know many changes for the better are in the work, I'm satisfied in general with my life. I don't know what I want to change tonight tho, and I feel like something needs to. I don't know how I can otherwise feel alright.",23May2018,2,
73,"I'm 28/M.

Every time my life starts going smoothly and things seem to be looking up for me there's something inside me that snaps and causes me to make a really dumb decision that backtracks me to an even worse place than I was in the first place. The building up of this well being in my life is a painstaking process and it's something I really have to work at over a period of time. Nevertheless, once I start to see the fruits of my labor and my life really starts to take a turn for the better I suddenly feel out of my element, and in a mere matter of days I tear it all down until all my hard work was for nothing. Not only that, but every time I do this I make things even WORSE than I even thought was possible, making it even harder to work back up to where I was when I was finally doing well.

This is a very simple and easily recognizable process that I knowingly put myself through and know exactly what's happening when it's happening - and THAT'S why it is so unbelievably fucking frustrating.

I've developed a very strong set of extremely maladaptive coping skills that, despite making my life a total fucking disaster, are always what I run back to when I'm out of my comfort zone. I've become used to chaos and unmanageable stress and when I'm in it I feel like it's my natural habitat. Drugs, alcohol, destructive behaviors, dishonesty and even narcissism are the staples of this chaos. And when I mean things go to hell, they really go to hell. I lose EVERYTHING. My homes, my jobs, my relationships, my material possessions, and my sanity. It's gotten so bad with these things that my life becomes so dysfunctional in every way that my mental and physical health starting deteriorate. And this is where I feel safe.

It's happening again and I'm so fucking sick of it. I have the chance to stop before it gets too bad but once I start it always seems to be like dominoes, one thing after another is ruined until there's nothing left to ruin. I've probably lost my job, I just got out of an extremely toxic and unhealthy relationship, my finances are fading and grip on reality is once again starting to weaken. I distract myself with drugs, sex, and really anything overly self indulgent until I completely block out the fact that I'm fucking everything up again. This is the first time in my life that I've reached out to anyone in the middle of it all, but it's still happening. The obvious answer would be to JUST STOP all the harmful behaviors and bounce back. For some reason, though, I genuinely don't know how to do that. This is a cry for help. Or just advice. Anything

I just needed someone to know. If you read this whole thing, thank you so much. I needed to be heard.",23May2018,3,

The scars aren’t as visible now due to growth and stretch marks. When I was 17 I spiralled into the thought of harming again, so instead I went and got a tattoo. Now every time I feel like I need to do it I get a tattoo. 
Some people may see this as a good thing, some people may see it as a bad thing. 
I for one see it as good. I’m turning my depression and anger that I have towards myself into art and something pretty to look at. Plus I don’t want to ruin the tattoos, so it stops me from further harm to myself. ",23May2018,2,
77,"So basically recently (it’s been happening a lot) I get really frustrated over small things, and get the feeling of being very warm and then become sweaty, and get very irritated, and then kind of break down. This sometimes leads to a headache. So what is it, and is it a problem?",23May2018,3,
78,"Throwaway because I'm ashamed. This is a stupid vent about a stupid, vapid problem, and I'm aware of that. My body hatred doesn't apply to other women, only myself. I'm in Ontario, if that matters at all.
TLDR; I hate every aspect of my body and I don't go outside of my house voluntarily because of it, or feel safe outside or around people.

Basically what it says on the tin. I was a fat kid, then an anorexic preteen, and now a chubby teenager.

It's not a delusion, though I do have obvious body image problems. I am overweight. Not obese, but overweight nonetheless. Nothing on my body looks the way I'd like it to. I didn't even get body fat where I'd wanted it, where it was socially acceptable. 

I do eat a proper diet and I exercise whenever I can. But I'm still seeing minimal results, even after starting about a year and a half ago. 

I'm aware of how disgusting I look, even if it's barely noticeable by others, so I never, EVER leave the house of my own will. I wear clothing that conceals as much of my body as possible when I need to go to school. I never see friends, do extracurriculars, I can't even go for walks. I have panic attacks when I'm around people or out in the open for too long.

Here's what bugs me the most. I'm a lesbian, or at least I hope I still am. But as of late, when I see women, my first response isn't attraction anymore - I can only compare myself, and hate myself for my failing to live up to them. For god's sake, I can't even jack off anymore without getting upset at myself.

As of late I only feel safe when I'm alone. I was always an introvert, but this is different. When I'm alone no one can see me. 

It makes me want to die, which is stupid because this is a very fixable problem. And I keep reminding myself that I'm working on fixing it. But in the moment, I look at my body and I want to just stop existing all together. 

If you read this whole stupid thing, thank you. I'm sorry for my pity party. Any advice would be appreciated.",23May2018,27,

86,"So I’m a freshman in high school, and all my dad really cares about me doing are sports and keeping above average grades in school. But he goes overboard with it, the school I go to is one of the hardest in the state, and he makes me do my sport(wrestling) an absolute shit ton. This has caused me to not have many friends, let alone an actual social life outside of school(and barely in school either) Which has left me not talking to many people for years, let alone getting dates or anything like that. He cares about it so much that he wants my main friends to be insanely good wrestlers, which all they talk about is wrestling, and when I didn’t become friends with them, he’s making me try to recruit my other friends to the team. And I remember whenever I was dealing with a pretty rough break up, he told me I had my wrestling to keep me happy. Oh and I remember he also once said “friends are temporary, achievements are a lifetime” which I think may be true shapes up to a miserable life. I honestly don’t know what to do at this point, I’m trying to dig out of the hole he’s put me in but at the same time he’s trying to shove me deeper in.

87,"I've been dating a girl since March who exhibits some really strange behavior I haven't seen before. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I only hope to better understand her so I can meet her needs. 

I am in my mid 30s and she is in her early 20s. We drink roughly three nights a week. These behaviors happen when we don't drink, but nowhere near as often. 

You can sort of see her sliding downhill as her mood starts to fluctuate the further we get into the evening. She goes from extremely sexual to tears almost immediately. While she is crying, she makes odd gestures with her hands. She will kind of wave them around. She also counts, both verbally and in sign language, from one to ten over and over again. Sometimes she will repeat my name over and over again for 5-15 minutes at a time. Sometimes she'll talk about things that she feels guilty about and she'll repeat ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" over and over again. I never question her and I try to show her kindness and empathy while she goes through this. She always apologizes to me in the morning for tolerating it, and I always reassure her that I wasn't bothered by it. I take the opportunity to talk about it when she brings it up, but she's very sensitive and I'm afraid to hurt her. I have told her that it is made worse with alcohol and that she probably shouldn't drink, but she disagrees and drinks any way. 

It is clear that she suffers from some serious mental illness as a result of some trauma she's experienced.

My exams are in 12 days and I need good grades to meet my university offer and I just can't get them.

I live at home with my parents. Due to dropping out and other circumstances, I don't really have many friends and I have no one to socialise with. Most people I went to school with have moved on to university or into jobs, while I'm still trying to pass exams everyone I know took 3 years ago. I have a girlfriend but we've been having troubles at the moment because we're long distance and she says she doesn't feel loved enough, even though I literally adore her.
