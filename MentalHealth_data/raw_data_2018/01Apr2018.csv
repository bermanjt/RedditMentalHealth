0,I really don't want to still exist after dying and I just can't shake it off that it will happen. And I don't want to go on anti-anxiety medication too because I can barely function as it is on antidepressants and anti-psychotics.,01Apr2018,3
1,"I can't deal with this anymore, not alone. I can't deal with doing something wrong, like forgetting a stupid till out of the safe and having my mind running circles around it until I freak out. I don't even know why. I'll get at worst a hand slap, maybe a harsh reprimand. I'm distracted, everyone knows that, I can forget things. I am allowed to, I won't get fired. I KNOW that. I still freak out. I still panic. I still feel like it makes me a terrible employee. It's just a stupid student job. 

Saying something and just deconstructing the whole conversation, trying to pick details. Worrying if I did something wrong, if people will judge me, if I'm liked, if they laugh at me, if they trash me, what they think of me. I should not have to worry that my SOs stopped loving me out of the blue. I don't know why I do. 

I'm done with all of these worries. ""What if I'm fat"" ""what if I have cancer"" ""what if I'm pregnant"". I'm done with them. I'm tired of them. Scanning my skin, stroking my ribs, it does not solve anything. It's just temporary soothing. It's just coping. Telling myself ""If the next person I see have blue shirt, then I have cancer"" is not rational. Feeling this flare of utter panic, like your blood ran cold, when you see a guy with a blue shirt amongst a thousand people in a busy train station... this is not okay. This is not a diagnosis. I know that. I *know it*. I can't help it. Telling myself ""intuition tell me..."" until I get what I want. Until I stop in the middle of the road, silently mouthing the words until it *feels* right. This is not right. This is not okay. 

I once stopped having sex for six months to make sure I wasn't pregnant, even though I had my period, the tests came back negative and I was STILL convinced I could have an ectopic pregnancy. How is this even okay? 

 I can't deal with people telling me to just let it go. I can't let it go. I *can't* okay? I just can't. I probably like it even less than you do, because you're not in my mind. You don't have to deal with all of those what if's, and what if it isn't, and everything else. 

I want to change, I want to stop being so paranoid. I don't know what's wrong and I'm done running away. Even if it means being told I'm a freak and that nothing is wrong. I want to know.

2,"Hi, so I'm someone who suffers from severe depression &amp; anxiety. I've had kind of a difficult life growing up: lost my mother when I was extremely young, my father who suffered from Bipolar Disorder kind of failed in the whole ""I'll do anything for my kids"" and we moved around a lot, got evicted a lot, etc. Basically, I feel like I kind of had to grow up too fast. The first time we were evicted was when I was in second grade, but I was too young to really realize (besides, we moved in with my grandmother, so it was kind of fun for me.) The second time, I was in 8th grade. And from there on out, it just kind of screwed me up a lot. 

I know I've got a lot going on inside my head (working on getting into therapy, gotta love waitlists lmao) but I've noticed that sometimes I think back to times when I felt really 100% at peace, and it's honestly back when I was younger, probably about 10 or so. And I would be sitting at my computer, wrapped up in a blanket, playing either club penguin, neopets, or minecraft or something. (in my little fantasy, it's raining too lmao bc the rain really relaxes me) And I'm eating something dumb, like chicken nuggets and chocolate milk.

Is it wrong to indulge in these behaviors every now and again? Thinking about spending a day off wrapped up in a blanket, playing a dumb old computer game, eating food that a 10 year old would eat just makes me feel so relaxed. I can't tell if there's like a developmental issue here or if it's alright to do lmao. I'm 19, btw. 

I just know I've had a lot of issues developmentally. I had a sippy cup for too long, and a pacifer for waay to long (probably about like age 8 or 9... my dad just kind of sucked at being assertive and literally just didn't care whether or not I had it) and like I'm just always paranoid that bc my mom passed when I was early, and I had to ""grow up so fast"" when it came to being throw in the middle of adult situations at age 12 and up, that it kind of messed with me and I've got the mental and emotional capacity of a 5 year old. 

I don't know if that makes much sense haha, I'm just kind of letting my thoughts out as I type. ",01Apr2018,3
3,"I don't seem to find someone to love.. to care about. Yes I know.. sounds cliche..

I dont seem to have what it takes to have someone on my side. And I feel so lonely. (cliche) 

I came to this point in my life that I truly believe that I will never be first choice to nobody. i strongly believe that I am gonna be alone forever. I believe that I need to accept that. Maybe I am someone like that.. made to be lonely. Not everybody can be married. But I don't even think about it.. I just want someone to give all this stupid cumulative love that I have inside me. I despise Valentines Day. I hate emoji hearts. I am in a point that seeing a happy couple in front of me makes me sad. i avoid the cinema theaters (one of my passions).. always full with couples. I feel so different... so unnatural. I don't know what can I do, I am not worth it I guess. i don't understand the love game... Some people do. I don't. Like some can read Greek.. some don't. I just need to accept that the ""love language"" is something that is not for my intelectual. Sometimes I see people that meet in a rather simple way and about a week later they are already boyfriend/girlfriend! And other that break up and some time later already in another relation!! How they do that?! I dont get it!! I dont understand. But some will say ""It will happen before you even think about it"" (the passive opinion) ""you have to give time"" (another passive opinion) .. ""you have to learn to love yourself first"" (I like me!! Damn).. bla bla bla.. tired of the same old mambo advice.. I consider myself a good looking guy... Very clever, positive, good humor, I travel a lot (alone obvious), I like to play guitar, videogames, running, I think I have a very very good general knowledge of everything that surrounds me.. from the biggest planet.. to the small ant...but.. that is not enough! That is good in their own way.. but you lack the other side of life..! I dont know what can I say more. And then of course comes the ""bad voices"" in your head.. like ""your not worth it, you are dumb, stupid, etc""...

Im single with 40 years old. And that is not what crushes me the most... many people are single no matter what age.. Its just this crazy feeling that I have.. the feeling of acceptance that I would be like this forever the disbelief of finding someone basically - The truly lack of hope. I dont have hope anymore. And brings me to fucking low very low state of mind. Damn I am so nice guy... I think I have everything to make a woman happy... or I think I have. Maybe I dont have with 40 single, probably dont.

I dont have a response for what I am facing.. Why me? I dont understand. Mental health? I dont know.. maybe yes. There is some mental problem with me that I dont understand or do not realize I have. Oh God I just want a answer to improve myself. What is wrong with me.",01Apr2018,1
5,"I've been steadily improving over the past 6 months and I honestly feel like I'm 80-90% of the way out of my depression, but something happened recently to my back. I'm not sure if I pulled something due to bad form at the gym, or if this is related to my previous history of back problems, but I have mild back pain that will sometimes lead to me feeling VERY dissociative.

This is my biggest worry, the dissociative feelings. I checked with an orthopedic and he saw nothing wrong from his pov, I just don't know why I feel detached for 2-3 hours of the day if I strain myself too hard. It's happened about 3-4 times in the past two weeks now.

Now I'm noticing increased anxiety, and I'm very fatigued halfway through my day, starting to become more reliant on caffeine.

I don't know, it's just late at night so there's no real place to find help right now, just waiting the weekend out before I can schedule anything. I appreciate any advice from people who might know wtf this back/dissociative thing is

edit: suddenly feel a lot less depressed. Feels like I went from a 6/10 to a 1/10 over the course of the past hour. It may be because I immediately went to make plans to fix this and also externalized it, but that drastic of a change is kind of unusual",01Apr2018,4
7,"I’ve lost jobs but told I’m such a great person and a hard worker, but they just couldn’t keep me employed. I’ve struggled with “basic” things my whole life. A huge problem I’ve had is speed. I’ve literally walked behind everyone (natural walking speed) my whole life, and in school I’d always be the last one to finish a test, eventually I started just quickly circling random answers due to this (everyone already hated and made fun of me).

It’s always taken me longer to do things. I’ve had social problems my whole life too (I was socially isolated, cause everyone hated me and made fun of me). 

The world is a fast place though, even, ESPECIALLY low wage entry level jobs, fast pace. The modern world is fast and will leave you behind if you can’t catch up.

Someone even outright said that I’m disabled. She assumed that I was on SSI disability getting money from the government, when I told her I’m not, she said I need to apply for it. This was a coworker, where everyone’s an adult. Others were there, but no one made fun of me when she said that, in fact, they wouldn’t even act like they heard, even though they were standing there and participating in the beginning of the conversation (before it turned to assuming I was on disability). 

So maybe I wasn’t being made fun of, this was an actual, serious assumption and opinion (fact?) about me, and what they said DOES match up with my worries (along with people implying I’m disabled but no one else has outright said so, only this one person has actually said it, most people won’t outright say such a thing). 

Apparently I do appear to be disabled. This only confirms my suspicions and insecurity and worries. People have known it, it’s just that the majority of people won’t come outright and say it, even if they’re an a$$hole.

12,"I've struggled through anxiety and depression my whole life. It's always taken some of the fun away from my life and I have a problem with comparing myself to others and low self esteem.

Ive gotten to the point where literally EVERYTHING these days makes me feel bad about my life and triggers me. Seeing other people living their lives normally, even watching TV or reading books. I end up having the intrusive thought that I am nobody and everyone has personalities and lives and have stuff going for them. I feel totally blank and empty and devoid of a sense of being and self esteem/worth. It's like all my past experiences, friendships, accomplishments etc. escape my mind. I just feel like I have to isolate myself from literally everything in order to not totally go mad from comparing myself. I avoid doing most things and don't even want to talk to my friends anymore or meet new people. Does anyone else feel this way? Even getting dressed, showering and doing normal things that shouldn't be hard has become a struggle.

The only thing that brings me comfort is the thought of killing myself. I like indulge in the ideation of it because it seems like the only solution my mind can come up with. But then I never end up doing it. I try to tell myself not to think about it but life is literally so long and hard (and I'm young and can barely even handle the few responsibilities I do have). I don't get how adults have made it so far. Giving up is all I want to do. 

Did anyone ever recover from feeling this way? I feel like I'm a broken record. A lost cause who should just stop existing bc I can't handle a damn thing anymore.

13,"im 24 years old, i have about zero memory from any age before i was about twelve, i remember pretty much everything onward because when i started high school, i was hit hard with depression. i had a few unexplainable interactions with what i would call otherworld things. to be honest, one night i was being chased by the devil himself. this might seem a little wild and we can just say it is my schizoaffective acting up, but think about it for a second. say this really did happen, all my life ive been dealing with psychopathic criminal thoughts. these thoughts are not just generated from broken wiring in the brain or nervous system. sure there is science there and it can be attributed to that, but really, doctors hardly understand anything about the brain at all. we get chucked with labels and medications and therapies that we're supposed to go by to try and deal with our emotions, but where do you turn when none of it works and doesnt help you control your thoughts? maybe because those thoughts *arent our own*. now you might be sitting there saying yep here's another classic schizo spouting his crazy conspiracies. but im telling you, ive done and seen enough to know that there is another world out there, things that we cannot perceive and frankly people are scared to admit or try to understand because they can't control it. we think we are in control of everything, and im here to say no to that. so, where am i going with all this? im trying to say that in my life so far, ive encountered and have been exposed to a lot of dark, scary, powerful things. just humor me for a minute, and think of it hypothetically if you have to, now i do believe in God, heaven, hell, the whole nine. my experiences so far, i have had most of the signs of possession or attachment of demonic energy. ive had a history of depression and psychosis, i go through this cycle of depression coming out of nowhere, doing something, having it go away, then it coming back even worse than before. this past week, its been pretty rough. i now have adrenal fatigue from dealing with all of this, which i have an appointment to get sorted soon. now, it seems to be just getting worse, im not sure what i can tell my therapist anymore. i feel that im going to commit a heinous crime soon if i dont get a grip back on to my mind and reality. im holding on by a chin hair. i know i have psychotic episodes, but this isn't just that. this isn't just depression, this is something thats just so buried deep within that i can't fathom whatever this illness and these symptoms are coming from. with all of that being said, im at a complete loss of direction. i have a therapy course starting on tuesday, but im not sure what im can be told that is going to do anything to whatever is going on with me. it seems beyond help, i know its not, but it is getting worse, and worse, and worse. i can't ignore it any longer, but i've tried all the treatments. ive done the therapy, dbt, ect, tcms, dieting, praying, medication, hypnosis, drugs, meditation, black magic, and probably anything else you could think of that would help. but guess what ive gotten out of all that? nada. its just worse. like i said, im at a complete loss. so, what im asking is, what method is there of healing that can get rid of this? is there some spiritual cleansing i can do? there is some type of spirit or energy attached and it's really bad, and if i dont do something soon, i dont know what could happen. i feel like i need to take some Lsd and 'face my fears' or something like that. this thing needs to be pulled out of me, its not going to move anywhere with some low-level drug manufactured by a company. right now it's laughing at that idea. i know this was long, but please listen and if you can contribute any type of suggestion or point me to some reading material, any support would be appreciated.",01Apr2018,1

21,"Not sure if this belongs here or on dogs or someplace else. 

Anyway, due to my mental health I have no friends. I struggled with beeing lonely and worsening depression whenever my SO worked evenings and nights and I were alone in the apartment. To fix this I told my SO I wanted a dog so I did not have to be alone. We have both had several dogs growing up, my SO loves dogs, but she wanted to wait with getting a dog until we are thinking about children and so on (we are still in our 20s). Anyway she eventually agreed. 



We had trouble agreeing on a breed. I wanted a big lazy loving dog big enough for hugs. She wanted a small quick one, capable of running, playing and tricks. Eventually we landed on the german shepherd as a middle ground. We heard it could be a 1 owner dog, but at the same time a ton of people including the breeder said that it's not true and that they are great family dogs. Fine. 1 year ago we got our pup from a great breeder. 

I stayed at home with the pup for the puppy period and we had a great time. My SO worked so I did most of the work with the pup. I'm a student so after the summer the dog rarely had to spend many hours alone, as I mostly were at home studying. We noticed fairly early that she expressed way more joy towards seeing my SO than me. If she had been alone she could actually jump over me to greet my SO for example. We noticed and tried to combat the behavior with me doing even more of the positive training/feeding and so on. It got slightly better the following months, but now that the dog is grown (1 year) it's worse than ever. 

The dog has 0 interested in me. It only cares for my SO. If she's working the dog whill lie at the door waiting for her to come home. If she's sleeping after working a night shift, she will lie by the bed the entire day with 0 regards to what I am doing around the house. The house feels just as empty as before we got her. If me and my SO are together the dog only uses me to get to her, for example if we are both sitting in the couch and I start to pet the dog she will stare at my SO and lean over to her to try to get pets from her rather than me.  

My SO loves the dog a ton, but would prefer it if the dog cared less for her since after all it was me who wanted a dog, and at the moment it's not even our dog, it's only my SOs dog by choice. 

I dont know if I have been too strict with her or done something wrong or if she's just a 1 person dog by instinct or if she prefers females over males or if she just does not like me. It's just a shitty situation and I only feel sad when I look at the dog at this point. I do nearly all the work and I did love her it's just so hard not to be affected by the fact that she obviously does not like me.  

Atm it boils down to;

TL;DR: I got a dog to combat social isolation. It does not like me, only my SO. Everytime I look at her now I think ""not only do I fail with people, but not even my dog likes me"". 

Edit: Several people seem to think the dog is not getting any stimulation from he, that's not the case. I don't think I would feel like she did not like me if I never did anything with her. But like I tried to write I have done 80% of the work with her, walks, play, feeding, washing, training, and still I am not liked. It makes me feel like it's me that is in my essence unlikeable.

24,"My new psychiatrist decided I'd be better off on aripiprazole/Abilify/Zykalor 10mg starting than ziprasidone/Ypsila 40mg.

He said that he noticed I was talking very quickly and in a disordered way. I didn't quite understand what he meant by that, and I didn't have the right questions to ask at the time.

I've still not changed my meds so far, as I'm waiting for Abilify to be available in the apothecaries, as there was a lack of stock.

My main problems with ziprasidone were that I would restlessly walk around, especially when under mental stress or standing. I couldn't stand still, but I could lie down and most of the time sitting wasn't a problem either.

Another problem is that ziprasidone has side-effects that I can tolerate, and I'm overall happy with the medicine. This means I don't understand the medicine change fully, I don't understand whether it's possible to be ""entirely cured"" of my illness.

To state, I have depression and anxiety. As it said, I have some disordered thinking or talking, that has actually done some bad things to me in the past. Doctors say it's a form of schizophrenia. Both anxiety and depression were reduced greatly by sertraline, an SSRI antidepressant, while neuroleptics haven't touched me in a good way at all -- I don't like being dependent on something that doesn't help.

Teas are the literal devil to me. I've been physically ill recently, and I drank a lot of tea with honey to help my health. The first day of drinking teas, I was fine. The second day I felt slightly hungry. The third and further days I felt constantly hungry. Glad that this has all passed, but I know it will happen again, and the only way for me to avoid this is to not drink teas with sugar and to avoid simple carbs.

The hunger usually doesn't feel like the sort of hunger that gives you an appetite, it feels different.

My doctors say that they've never heard of a symptom like this, and that my blood sugar is normal. So it's not diabetes.

I don't currently have the option to withdraw from neuroleptics, but I've been off of risperidone, specifically, for more than half a year now or about 8 months. The symptom persists.

31,"Hi everyone, I'm a 19 year old male who was recently diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. After going through multiple psychiatrist and being misdiagnosed with depersonlization disorder, I have finally found out what is going on with my mind.

My early life was hectic to be sure. I had a loving mother who loved me but was very strict and judgmental about what I did. My father in my early years was an extremely violent alcoholic who would put me in constant unease and fear everytime he was around me. I went through constant bullying during school due to my stutter, I had multiple mental breakdowns during this. I became unnecessarily hostile to animals often throwing them off my porch, locking them in my closet to hear them cry, and other things. I had a cousin I was around often who would abuse me and occasionally molest me.

My teen years was better than my child years but problems still happened. I was in the office at least once a month and instigated multiple fights. I still went through bullying and would often pretend to be scared and sorry, then when they looked away I would attack them. I was diagnosed with adhd around grade 6 and have been taking them since. I dropped out in 11th grade under the ruse of homeschooling and took advantage of my mom's generosity and have lied about doing my schoolwork. I still to this day haven't completely school.

During my later teen years I drew my impulsive nature into a dilapidated period of drugs. I did lsd, ketamine, mdma, cocaine, meth, heroine. I also began a lucrative career in selling lsd. Often making 900 dollars in a day. During this period in my life I stole money from my parents, tresspased, shoplifted, and drove while intoxicated. I have no remorse about what I did in this time even though I burned a lot of bridges.

Now welcome to the current. I work at home depot on the freight team. I hate my co workers because I see nothing but fakeness, the small talk they engage with me is meaningless and I cant stand the when someone trys to talk to me. I will only work freight team because I have no interaction with customers and get to work by myself on power equipment. I have no remorse for what I do but I don't perform heinous acts. I have two dogs who I care for and my immediate family. Thats about it. Despite popular beliefs people with anti social personality disorder can care for people. I'm trying to change who I am because I need to fit in. I'm sorry for the long post but I have no one to talk to about this because if I tell them I'm a sociopath I'm met with disgust.

35,"Hi, I'm a trans girl living in the US with emotionally, verbally, and (at least when I was younger) occasionally physically abusive parents. Basically, I'm the only one keeping myself together because I can't really rely on anyone for tangible support. I can talk to my friends, but talking doesn't make my situation any better.

I'm not in any imminent danger, so right now I'm just trying to survive while constantly being shoved down by life. I can't quit my part time right now, but I don't have the spoons or physical ability to do it properly. It's like being pushed to 110% when on the clock when I can barely give 50%.

My biggest concern is school because I need to keep my grades stable so I don't get kicked out of my #1 choice college by admissions before I'm even there. Problem is, I can, but barely, keep up in classes I understand, let alone classes I'm lost in. I'm not failing anything yet, but I'm not in control anymore. I don't have the energy for any of this because It's being drained every second. I'm overwhelmed and I hate all my classes, yet I can't drop a single one.

This last bit is a future problem, but maybe someone here's had experience with it? If you didn't know, America has a lot of hate for trans people, both legislative and social, and there's a chance the college psych could be a gatekeeper to my hormones if they know that I'm mentally ill. HRT is an essential thing for a lot of trans people, and I don't want to have to go black market for it because of how dangerous that is (buuut if it comes down to it, I have no choice).

Yeah, I'm kind of just getting all of this out here because I'm just trying to survive day to day in the hell and it's exhausting. I don't know what I'm supposed to do besides wait for summer to begin and end. Thanks for reading this.",01Apr2018,5
37,"Hi. I have been diagnosed and undiagnosed with a couple of mental disorders and i am on epilim 500mg n 30mg fluxoetine. I take hydroxine or xanax as an adjunct if i can't sleep. Recently, i have been feeling quite burnt out. I joined a club with many meetings, and my courses are very heavy on projects, assignments and tests. There is one mod where we have fewer ppl than average, another mod where we are tested on names and historical facts. The semester is ending in a month's time, giving me some time for final exams. Sometimes, i feel that my grp mates are very lassiez fairez..like i have one mod where my grp member isn't that competent with d subject matter.i have two other mods which seem ok but they r a lot of work too.

38,"I've been struggling with this for about 3 and a half years now. I've never heard of anyone having the same problem so I came here to write about my story. I'm really desperate and I really hope that someone has gone through the same thing and can tell me what is going on or what I should do.

So it started when I went from elementary school to high school (I was 15 then). It was then that I started to think about my purpose in this world. I decided to go to grammar school because I thought I would be able to make sense of life with the education I would get in school. Then a few months into highschool I started getting depressed. Then I started exploring on the internet about the purpose of life and stuff like that. Also everything in this world that wasn't natural felt wrong to me. For example, it seemed wrong to me that humans have lights, we don't wake up to the sun like animals naturally do, we wear clothes, we eat cooked food. I felt doing those unnatural things were wrong, but adapting my lifestyle to a completely natural life would be very hard. Then I started to think something must be wrong with me, so I started to search on the internet. I self-diagnosed myself with OCD, anxiety, depression and so on and when I was certain of what I have, then I knew what I have to do to be normal again. But this lasted only for a few days before I was unsure about my diagnosis again. I also have a brother and it seemed to me that we were very similar in what we did (staying at home, wondering about life). I was 15 at the time and he was 19. He didn't go to school and was at home all the time, he didn't talk to anyone. So I thought I was following the same path as him. Also, when I started changing I thought that it could be weed that triggered something in me, as it was at the beggining of highschool when I started to smoke weed (smoked about 10 times in 5 months).  About 5 months into highschool, my brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and because of that, I thought that I was going schizophrenic too.But then I found about a thing called Spiritual enlightement, and I thought that this could be happening to me, and I'm still not sure what is really happening. And if this is spiritual enlightement that is happening, then I shouldn't be seeing a  therapist as everything is fine with me.I've been seeing a therapist for about three years now and I don't think much has changed. I'm still confused as I was 3 years ago. I tried to stay away from videos about spirituality and psychedelic drugs on youtube because if I watched them, I felt like thing finally made sense but then I just became worried and sad. But when I prevebted myself from watching those videos or reading about that stuff, I felt like I was forcing myself from it because I was really interested in that stuf, or maybe it was just an obsession or a kind of an addiction. Today I'm still quite depressed and have no dirrection in life. 

If anyone is or went through the same thing, please write to me. I'm really desperate. I tried not thinking deeply about life but it didn't work.

If you do not understand any part of my story or would like to hear some detail, feel free to write to me.

And sorry for my bad english, I'm from Slovenia.

41,"I'm traveling out of state to the midwest tomorrow for work for a week.  I live in the south; I used to live in the midwest but work from home now so I only need to fly back to the midwest a few times a year for meetings or what have you.


I do suffer from depression and I felt like I was coming out of my latest funk recently but perhaps I'm not.  Actually, now that I have to fly out for work tomorrow I'm becoming a bit anxious.  Since working from home I have gained some weight...most of my few work outfits are fairly tight on me.  I ran out of a prescription I had been taking for acne and over the past 2 months I have broken out *horribly*.  I have scars all over my face and neck now which, at 39, I haven't dealt with this in years.  I'm back on the prescription now but it'll be a long time before my face is cleared back up.  I got my hair done for work yesterday and tried a new style and I absolutely hate it.  I don't know if I should leave it or try to do something else to it today.  A friend of mine just invited me out to meet up and after looking at myself in the mirror and taking a selfie and seeing how I actually look, I was like ""no way in heck I'm letting anyone see me today"".  I HATE feeling this way but I literally just feel terribly ugly and sloppy...the ugliest I have ever felt pretty much.  I just feel like I look like a monster; I feel a bit disgusted just looking at myself to be honest as harsh as it sounds.  I have totally avoided going out for the past year I've been working from home so I have not had to deal with the anxiety of having to show my face in public.  I just really don't want to be seen by others right now.

But I'm flying out tomorrow and I simply cannot go into work looking/acting like a drab/depressed Debbie Downer the whole time.  My colleagues are positive high energy Type A personality extroverted folk who to be honest I am glad I am not around in person anymore as it is just draining for me.  How can I turn my thoughts around so that when I land tomorrow I'll be able to be upbeat and productive and not so focused on how bad I feel like I look and am feeling right now??",01Apr2018,2

43,"Hi Reddit community,

I have a life-interfering problem: a deep dislike/hatred for the lowercase letter f and the lowercase letter y. I'm not sure where these irrational feelings come from, but they stress me out.

Specifically, the shape of the lowercase f bothers me in all circumstances whenever I see it. Typed in a word like ""affairs"" makes it seem, to me, like it's feeble, meek, and makes the word not carry the gravitas that I'd like to communicate sometimes. It's so bad that I cringe at the sight of typing ""Regulatory Affairs"" on my resume - and this may hamper my upcoming job hunt endeavors! :( Even typing the word ""of"" gives me this...indescribable, irritating-like stress.

When it comes the the lowercase y, I don't have a problem if the tail is straight like with the Calibri or Verdana font. I suppose my mind reads this straight, non-tailed y as ""perfect"" and ""in visual harmony"" with the rest of the word or sentence. I get really stressed out when I see or have to write a lowercase y that has a tail, as with the Arial font. It stick out awkwardly and makes me feel uncomfortable. Again - not sure why.

I've even had to go to great lengths to reword sentences in essays or email just to avoid these two letters. It's not efficient. I'm naturally an ambitious intellectual who has a sharp eye for detail and loves to write (which is ironic, but maybe this can give away some clues about a condition?)

I feel like I'm alone in the world with this unusual issue.

45,"I have been struggling with bipolar disorder for quite a while now. I am a 23 year old college student, and I currently live with my parents. Before I get to the heart of my issue I will point out several matters that are part and parcel of this struggle. My parents currently believe that I have this disorder, but it is almost taboo to discuss mental health in our family because we had quite a history of mentally-ill family members. I haven’t had any legitimate diagnosis but I went to see a doctor in the midst of my military training 4 years ago – he assured me that I suffered from depression alone. However, I recently read an article about Bipolar Disorder and I firmly believe that I have symptoms of manic depression. In that, I sometimes have a very high, intense mood that is positive in some way – it allows me to be creative and synergetic. On the flipside I go through episodes where I am numb, lazy and deeply depressed. The mental jar that holds my horrible memories releases those feelings back to life as if it triggers the depression phase. It is perhaps cliché to assume that life is a combination of ups and downs. But my case is extremely severe. I have been bullied, sexually molested, cast-away, rejected, went through parents’ divorce, physically abused by an elder sibling – and it had all happened before the age of 10. And it had only gotten worse after that. I wanted to convince myself that our character is not based on our past experiences because we are transparent. Albeit this has made me realize that I can still develop my personality, I found out that I have none. I always focus on role-models – seeking their advice; mimicking their behaviors and their values. It dawned on me that a lack of a father figure had played a big part in my childhood development. My story is very deep and longer than this post and I wish I could have written it all. My question is; do I need to consult a therapist as soon as possible? Do I take medication that stabilizes my mood) even though I play sports? Would it affect my professional, social and emotional statuses? (Knowing that I have been presented with many opportunities and wasted them all. It almost gives me a certainty that my disorder has everything to do with it). Am I going mad? 
I highly believe that reddit is a place of well-informed people, most of whom are individuals such as me that could have taken their problem into consideration and can therefore be well equipped to help me do the same. So please, help me find my answers.

48,"I believe that I have a mental issue but my parents and my friends tell me that I’m just exaggerating things and if I just decided to be positive or faked being positive, then I’d be just fine. So I wanted to ask reddit what they think. Here’s what I’m usually feeling on any typical day.. 
1. Demotivated and lethargic 
2. I get sudden flashbacks from things that happened ages ago OR things that haven’t happened which make me either very angry or very depressed. 
3. I get so lost in what is happening in my head that my facial expressions/ body language is of that situation and not where I am. (Sometimes this happens when I’m in the middle of a conversation with people) 
4. Anxious and preoccupied. For e.g., I’m scared of going in the elevator. So if we’re making a plan about going to a place that has elevators, I’m going to spend the rest of my time imagining myself in that elevator and how I would feel in it. 
5. Upset when I browse social media because I feel everyone is happier, prettier, richer and more successful than me. 
6. Have a sudden major mood swing even though nothing has happened to warrant that mood swing. 
7. Feel paranoid at times. Where I obsess over why someone didn’t talk to me or why someone said something about me. And that it must have some ulterior motive or meaning. 
8. Feel forgetful. Or I can remember the events but not the names of even regular things. 
9. Have no energy to interact with people. 
10. I make a sentence in my mind but when I say it loud, it’s something else entirely. While I’m saying it, I realise that I’ve said it wrong but being too anxious to correct myself. 
11. Sometimes, not being able to talk in a louder voice.  
12. If I’m not able to express myself (which happens often), I end up uncontrollably crying. 
13. Being extremely negative. Speaking negatively about myself and people. 
14. Feeling compelled to do things like, I have to charge my phone to a 100% before I sleep. So even if it’s getting late, I can’t sleep because my phone is not at 100% yet. I understand I’m being irrational but I can’t stop. 
15. Having stupid fears like a) I can go up on an escalator but not down b) while going downstairs, I’ve to feel the stair first with my foot before stepping on it c) only being able to go downstairs if I’m holding the railing d) being uncomfortable in loud, crowded areas e) sometimes being scared of being in a vehicle because I feel like I’ll get stuck inside and never get out. 
16. One line of criticism from someone will unsettle me for days. 
17. If something exciting or different is happening in my life on say, the 25th then not being able to do anything before it or just postponing things to after that date (even if I have time to finish it now) 
18. Knowing my faults but not being able to change myself. 
19. Feeling hopeless and victim like all the time. Feeling overly guilty at times for no reason. 
20. Going to any extent to get attention. Like I once sent nudes to someone just so he would talk to me. Then getting impatient or upset for no reason and stop talking to that person then again start to feel lonely etc etc.. cycle goes on. 
21. Opening up to people about how I feel and then regretting sharing it with people because they must think lowly of me now. 
22. Getting all my frustration and anger out on my parents or at myself by self destructing. 
23. Being self destructive on purpose. 
24. Not giving a flying fuck about the fact that I’m obese and unhealthy. 
25. Feeling suicidal when all the emotions get too overwhelming for me. 
So yeah, I understand that this post might be pretty bizarre but really I want an honest opinion.. what is wrong with me... ",01Apr2018,1
50,"No excuse, now I'm on edge wondering if I'm going to be charged with something because the other driver was trying to take pictures of my license plate.

He was two cars behind me at a stop light and when it turned green it took me a few seconds to notice because I was looking left to see if there were any available street parking spots on the street I was about to turn on to (the green light was from a one way to a one way, turning left).

He honked for a ridiculously long time even after I started moving and I lost it. He pulled up next to me at the next dual turn on to another one way and was gesticulating and saying something, I rolled down my window and just lost it on him. I didn't threaten him, but I was saying ""F You, Shut up, It was an accident, F You, F Off"" as loud and scary as I possibly could. He went first on the dual turn after I yelled and when we got to the next red light he was taking pictures of me and stayed stopped to try and get a picture of my license plate. GAH! I'm such an idiot. I hate being me. I woke up with the normal levels of suicidality and depression, and now I've just dug myself another little hole. I'm not made for this world. 

I feel like an absolute psycho. I've been such a mess for so long and have been doing a lot of mental health and addiction recovery work, and still I'm just such a mess to the point where I'm just walking around full of rage. Fucking nothing helps. Life is just one big stressor after another. My head is so full of poison and I can't seem to change that fact no matter what. People in AA keep telling me to spend more time on recovery each week and I can't seem to get my shit together and just fucking do it. I spend about 4 hours a week between meetings and the occasional meet up with a new comer, but it doesn't really feel like enough I guess.

I finally have a couple days off (I work two jobs to pay off debt I stupidly incurred by being an impulsive addictive personality) and now I can't enjoy it at all because I'm on edge wondering if the police are going to knock on my door.

I didn't threaten the other driver, but I yelled at the top of my lungs which is probably considered threatening.

53,"Well here it goes. First of all sorry if this is on the wrong subreddit but do feel free to correct me and show me a place where this is more appropriate. This is most likely going to be more of a incoherent ramble, a lonely talk to myself and shitty self-diagnose but I'd love to hear some of your words about what you think of my situation or something. Yeah..


I'm a 20 year old dude from the cold north Europe. Just your ordinary university student on his first year, living alone, trying to figure out his place out in the world. The thing is that I don't feel like I'm even close to finding it. I'm on the track to possibly finding it since I'm studying on a field I really like and would like to proceed and work on in the future, but I feel like that's really the only thing going for me. I have a certificate on a line of work already and could work full-time but instead I decided to go further in my studies and went onto a university of applied sciences. I'm doing rather well in there surprisingly even though my background isn't the most optimal for it because I've done mostly practical studies instead of reading in the past years. I'd like to think that as an achievement really, getting into uni and all, but it comes with the flip side of not having a +2 week break from anything for 6 years or actually having a good amount of time just for myself. But I guess that's nothing out of the ordinary?


I've moved cities to study too. I moved to a completely new and foreign location and I did not know anyone from the new city I moved into. Maybe a bad move, but I felt like I needed serious change, cut my ties from the old same faces and surroundings and just move somewhere else, far away. Actually I felt like doing that for over 4 years because I didn't really feel like I would fit in my old city. And to be honest moving away was one of my best decisions ever, I love it here. On the other hand though I don't really have friends at the moment, only my classmates in school but as you know, I only see them when I'm there, 5 days a week at most. I wish we could be friends and hang out after and out of school but that is yet to happen even though I have proposed for it a couple times. Maybe I need to try harder. Being honest actually, I'm really fucking lonely here. I just study, at school and at home, and after that I'm alone. Inside these walls. I mean I never had more than like say 5 friends anyway at my old town but still.


Telling more about my background I've always wanted to travel. For a long time now, for about 5-6 years, but regardless I have never left my own country. I'd want to experience and see the world and the people it holds, meet new people, see new things, talk to someone unknown. Essentially to feel alive for a while I guess. Regardless of this urge, I've always covered all my time by work and studying. Even when I'm done with one education I feel like that isn't enough and I just move onto another and leave no time for myself at any point, hence going to uni straight away. I've never really experienced a good working cycle for a few months at a stable job but then again I'm only 20 so its pretty normal I guess. I feel like I'm just very busy all the time, even when I shouldn't be I fill up my time very effectively. 


I also like to spend my alone time playing video games. I think they calm me in a way and let me work out my competitiveness. They let me sink into another world for a while. I like to play Counter-Strike even though it's not the best game for winding down, especially when you don't have friends who play the game but need to rely on complete strangers. At least that's how I felt before. Nowadays I don't really like playing anything I own either. I don't have friends to play with so any co-operative game feels pointless and I'm yet to find a good time sink. Maybe I should stop being on the computer and find some other hobbies? Oh yeah, I had those too but had to leave most of them when I moved at the latest. I used to race on 2 and 4-wheelers, play drums, climb buildings and do other stuff like that but almost every single one of them is hard to pass with yourself when you really don't have any income. Don't get me wrong, I switched parts of my acoustic drum kit for an electric one to play here, I have a great PC and peripherals and other equipment for various hobbies but whenever I start trying to do something I just feel it's not for me, I'm too tired and lazy to keep on going and trying to be better at whatever I'm doing.


Just a side note; at this point of the rant it actually feels a bit easier on my mind and it feels nice to lay a lot of stuff just out there. Almost like you'd talk to someone, open up you know. Haven't done that in a long time, can count that timescale in years also. Also I don't do any drugs nor have I ever done anything except alcohol. I come from a family where my relatives are mostly alcoholics or narcotic abusers so, there's that also. So no, I don't take anything to feel better and if I'm completely honest I wouldn't if could either way. I feel like you need to be able to handle yourself and your thoughts when you're you, sober and sensible. I also want to stress out heavily that I'm not suicidal nor do I want to inflict self-harm, I detest sliding down there and I couldn't do that to myself and to others even more so.


On a more emotional scale I feel like I'm just very lost. In a span of 1-2 years I've felt like I'm changing emotionally but I really couldn't pinpoint how or in which direction. When I now think about it maybe I've changed for the worse. I don't know what to do and just feel like burning out. I'm so fucking lonely. Sad. I don't want to say I'm depressed because that is thrown around too much and to be honest I hate thinking that I'd be one of ""those depressed people"". Regardless of this however I find myself listening to and enjoying depressing, melancholic and sad music for most of the time accompanied with very heavy feels. Just feeling like.. something. Sad, over all emotional, worthless, something that I can't really pinpoint. But all in all, were I depressed or not, I feel like I'm starting to learn how those guys feel like. Actually, you don't really feel that much in the end, no anger, no sadness, just emptiness. You're pretty much like a shell. Just wave and smile boys, wave and smile..


TL;DR I'm lost, most of the time feeling sad and lonely or something along those lines. Reject to call myself depressed even though I most likely check many marks on that list too. What is going on and how do I better myself?


If you made it and read it through I congratulate you, feels nice to know that maybe someone might read through how I feel inside my head. I'm quite relieved from writing this down anyhow so I guess I should thank you regardless. I'd love to hear if you have any opinion what might be going on with my emotional self, what is causing these feels and what should I do to proceed and change for the better. I'm also open to answering any questions you may have for me or just talk about anything overall. ",01Apr2018,1

I can usually control it within a few seconds but it did evolve into a full on crying sesh once.

61,"Hi,

it is the main problem, even though I know specific thought patterns will hurt me deeply, I cant let them go. Yeah, they get rarer occasionally, but when I have a low, my subconscious brings them up like: You have dealt with it so long, lets bring them up again. And the bad thing is, they always bring me extremely down, to the point where I seem to lose control over me, my identity, life. It is like a war inside my head. Even though I dont have a particularly bad history (just a few months of Depersonalisation), those months broke me down and now I am a little, 19 years old wreck who suffers very badly because of his mind's made up, fucked up reality. 

I can barely stay present, always overthink and think about my life instead of living it, when I look at my mental image in my mind, I cant make sense out of how I am still alive. In August I overthought the whole idea of life and believed that I would kill myself in the next few months, but I didnt because I wanted to live. Now my mind always comes up with these old thought patterns and I ruminate about maybe it is wrong to be alive and then I have a huge inner conflict, because back then the idea of my destiny being suicide was so...convincible. 
I dont know...I dont know why I changed into such a mental wreck. Really tough months tbh. Not one week feeling perfectly fine. My memory is non-existing, time is rushing by, I cant make sense out of time, out of the date, everytime I look at the date my mind questions and argues ""Why are you still alive?!"".

Because that blessing wouldn’t be shining through the thick skin you have formed, if you couldn’t take a pesky diagnosis.

63,"I'm definitely not a mentally healthy person, but I don't have the means to pursue help. I'm just looking for a bit of insight here. I don't know what to think.

So there seems to be at least 4 main categories of things wrong with me.

1. I suffer from chronic depression. I actually did get this diagnosed back when I had to means to see a psychologist. I may also have some mild degree of mania, or at least a mildly obsessive personality which drives me to somewhat manic behavior.

2. I have intimacy issues. I have difficulty getting close to people, and even more difficulty comfortably imagining myself actually being in an intimate scenario with anyone (fantasizing is fine, but actually considering the possibility is disturbing to me). I have no memory of every being sexually assaulted or abused, and my family isn't at all conservative about this kind of stuff (not super open though), so I don't know where this comes from.

3. I don't know if I've experienced hallucinations or dissociation, but I've felt as if I have. Kind of like I have some sort of paranoia about the possibility of these symptoms, and any mild hallucinations or dissociation set of alarm bells in my head.

4. I fluctuate between feelings of grandeur that I recognize are unrealistic, but still feel are very real, and feelings of worthlessness, which I fully know aren't valid.

The 3rd and 4th categories don't really have a significant negative impact on my life. They just make me feel kind of uncomfortable. The 1st and 2nd obviously have significant impacts on my life.",01Apr2018,1
64,"Life just feels like it sucks.

I have a chronic illness-Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome-and I'm so scared of having attacks. I can barely go to bed at night without anxiety and OCD and depression filling my brain. I feel ugly and want to starve myself, I feel like I'll never amount to anything because I can never see loving myself. My family is falling apart-my divorced parents hate each other more and more every time, they used to be close, even after the divorce, but now it seems like they're hating each other. My brothers are either absent, uncaring, or violent, one's just been found with cocaine and would've beat my mom up if his friends hadn't been there to stop him. 

The only reason I don't kill myself is my dog, no one would take proper care of him if I wasn't around to do it. 

I know it can be so much worse, but it feels like I can't breathe. Therapy's only once a week and sometimes it feels like it's not enough. I don't know what to do. I'm terrified something will happen to my brother, I'm terrified something will happen to my mom, and I feel a responsibility to stay here at home because my mom needs me. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to feel better, I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, I just want everything to get better. I would give anything for things to be okay again with my family and with my head and my body. I just want to feel better, get better, and have the same for my family. I want it so bad. I just need some support to feel like someone out there knows what I'm going through. I feel like I'm in unending pain but that I don't deserve to feel bad-my mom has it worse dealing with my brother. I feel so alone. ",01Apr2018,1
66,"I possessed very psychotic/sadistic behavior when I was younger and I'm just wondering why the hell I was never ever assessed... No seriously.

[Elementary] I was obsessed with animals and humans being trapped in cages and would draw them screaming and crying for help. I even asked my dad when I was little for a pound cart (from Lady and the Tramp) because I wanted to go around the city and capture dogs and put them in the pound.

One time my mom went to get gas in the car and when she went inside to pay, I attacked my 3 year old sister (I was 7) and made her bleed. When my mom came back, I told her that my sister did it to herself. The scratches I inflicted on her were so deep that she had scars on her skin for years after that.

[Elementary - Middle school] Then I had a thing for hiding people's things... I would hide them and never tell them where it was. Or I would wait a very long time before finally telling them. A pretty bizarre example is one time I hid my cousin's Nintendo DSI at my grandparents' house and then dug it out and gave it to her 4 years later. I also purposely broke people's things and returned it to them and pretended it was an accident and laughed when they cried and panicked. Or I would just steal it and keep it.

[Middle school] I have also tried to murder my little brothers several times when they were infants by attempting to suffocate them or pushing them off high places. I remember hating one of my brothers for literally no reason (he was a sweet-natured kid who did practically nothing to me) and I kept trying to kill him and wish he was dead. I have also secretly wished death to other people for no reason. Like my friends at school. They did nothing to me.

[Middle school - high school] I also pulled cruel heartbreaking jokes as well. Such as faking my own death to make people cry and panic cuz I thought it was funny. Or I'd tell other people that their friends died for the same reason. On top of that, I would attack people at school and sometimes end up bruising them and making them cry. These jokes were also on social media.

I dunno... Is this even normal. BTW I'm fine now. It finally stopped after high school was over. ",01Apr2018,0
