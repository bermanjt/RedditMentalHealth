1,"Hi,
I'd like to start by first saying that I used to be a fairly extroverted person
I had no issues with taking to people and making new friends
But recently, since I had lost connection with many of my friends (moved away and stuff) , I am unable to talk to have a proper conversation with any of my other friends or acquaintances, that is, I end up making the conversation awkward for both of us. This also happens when I meet my old friends. Basically all people. I really wasn't like this before. My awkwardness used to be minimum but now it's kinda out of control. 
I don't know why I am doing this and due to this thing, I lost interest in talking to people. I avoid everyone (which I don't want to) and end up being alone
This really affects my mind and I feel like I'm losing all of the people that matter to me and actually care about me

2,"I've been to many therapists over the years and expressed my feelings of frustration about dating and connecting with girls. Yes, much of what I have expressed are feelings that I would never express openly in public or to any of my friends and if I did I would certainly face a huge social backlash. I think that most people would agree that therapy is the best place to address these feelings.

Recently however, given a lot of what I see going on in our society, I have found myself pondering the possibility that my secret thoughts are not safe with these therapists. Let's say that at some point in the future, I find myself in the public eye for some reason. I could be in the new or I could just be on Instagram or Youtube something (just hypothetical). What is to stop any one of these therapists to get online anonymously and, for whatever reason, share with the world the socially unacceptable things I have said in therapy sessions? Yes, I know that there is the whole confidentiality thing, but is there really any way to prove it was them if they posted anonymously? Especially considering I have shared these sentiments with multiple therapists. Also, the consequences for breaking those rules only really pertain to one's career as therapist. What if they have left the profession?

You would like to think that therapists understand that it is not their place to pass judgement and seek out retribution against their patients, but a couple experiences I've had have shown me that it isn't as farfetched as you would think. Also, at the pace society is currently moving, the power of the outrage mob is enough to overpower any law or institution.",14Oct2018,1
3,"  Up until recently I’ve always been an extroverted social person. Growing up I was one of the class clowns and while I wasn’t exactly popular I was well known and liked by my peers. 
 
   I’ve found connecting with people to be a breeze and making friends easy as hell. People have always told me I’m chill and funny, and I’ve never been awkward. In fact I would say I’ve chiefly relied on my people skills to get to where I am in life. 

  That all changed about 2 months ago when I started finding it hard to maintain eye contact with one of my supervisors. It was just one person for a few days. Then it became another coworker. I was still generally the same person but around these specific people I would act very awkward. 

It was a weird feeling for me, suddenly becoming more awkward. It was strange because connecting with people was never a conscious effort I just did it. 

  Then it became slightly worse. At work I was purely an awkward person making no eye contact and not participating in any of the jokes or games between people, which I had generally been a part of up until then. It was becoming hard to connect with my friends. I was in a sort of downward spiral of social aptitude. 


   Now I barely speak or make eye contact with my family. I only talk to them if they ask me a question. I’m awkward in the most mundane situations like the check out line. I miss the days when I just went about my life and didn’t worry about dumb shit like going to the store. 


The frustration has caused me to lash out at work and I’m on the verge of losing my job. I haven’t told anyone about this until now. Being a man it’s hard to tell people when you’re going through it. I’ve tried to force my way to the answers but I just don’t have them.

4,"Hiya, looking for a bit of advice. No throwaway cause idc.
I have quite bad anxiety around being healthy and a fear of illness. I understand it's relatively normal to be scared of becoming sick, but it's getting to the point where I genuinely am becoming anxious multiple times a day around various illnesses. I tend to obsess over a few specific ones, and even if I go to the doctors about it and find out I'm fine, the anxiety starts happening again once I've decided it's been long enough for an issue to come up. 
It's becoming a pain. I experience anxiety when I shower, for example, because I worry I'll find something wrong with me. Looking up symptoms online gives me panic attacks, and I've been putting of a routine doctors appointment because I can't bare the idea of something being wrong. When I'm on medication for something else, I obsess about the worst case side effects and I tend not to take things like cold medication and pain killers because I'm fearful of a reaction.
What should I do? I'm worried that if I go to someone, they'll dismiss my issues because they aren't a classic example of anxiety or depression. Is anyone else struggling with this and what do you do to help?",14Oct2018,1
5,"I've been in your shoes, and kind of still am. I know how your feeling, right now and throughout your day your trying to figure it all out. You're tying to answer all your questions and figure your life out. ""I need to get a relationship""  ""I need to get a new job"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Relax...

&amp;#x200B;

You don't need to figure it out right now. Believe it or not, things can be figured out over time. It doesn't need to be solved right now, today, or tomorrow. Take that stress and stretch it out. Your stress doesn't own your life so don't let it. Take time to enjoy the moment and soak everything in that's happening RIGHT NOW. Because sooner than later, right now won't exist and life will fly by. 

&amp;#x200B;

I struggled with this same feeling on an extreme level not to long ago but it wasn't until I was on a life changing experience that I realized. Things don't need to be figured out right now. 

Let me share some notes I wrote down in my notebook during my 'experience' 

&amp;#x200B;

""Feeling like I need to do something.."", ""This is just a battle with myself"", ""I feel like I need to prepare things""

&amp;#x200B;

My everyday stress was exaggerated and it wasn't until I let go and just enjoyed what was happening in the moment, that I became happy and wasn't stressing out. I actually managed to smile.

Remember, take time in your day to forget about the future, and the past, and take time to enjoy the present.

8,"I’ve suffered with anxiety for the majority of my teenage years and depression the last 2 years but I would relive all of my trauma from my childhood and teenage years instead of waking up on my birthday. 

A little bit of context to help paint the picture:

I’ve had a rocky relationship with my mum since my depression started. It was triggered by sexual assault by someone I worked with and then I was raped by my ex. Her way of helping me through it was to say that I was lying and that she didn’t believe that it actually happened because I didn’t tell her the day it happened. She was raped at 18 and she never lets me forget that. Unfortunately, I was in no stable state to talk about it happening until one day in an argument whilst I was losing my shit. It’s constantly been all about her. I’ve been going through a really tough couple of years trying to adjust to the severity of my mental health but she tried to make her mental health  and drinking problems my problems. She spent too much of my childhood and teen years trying to be my best friend rather than my mum. When I got with my current bf she flipped her shit at me and told me that I shouldn’t be with him, that she disapproved etc etc. (I’ve been with him for over a year now, a bit rocky but it’s not a bad relationship). She’d cause arguments with me over him because she was WAY too involved in my life and always has been. She personally picked GCSEs and alevels for me to do (the ones she picked, I failed). It ended getting to the extent that we’d argue and I’d walk out bc of the spiteful things she would say. In the end, I just ended up moving out. I’ve not spoken to her since August, the last time we saw each other. It went tits up... she was drinking and then doing the usual manipulative things she does. I ended up walking out yet again and haven’t spoke to her since. But I know recently she’s been in contact with my grandma (who I’m living with now) asking if I’m still living here or not. I’m absolutely shitting myself that’s she’s going to turn up out of the blue and that I’m going to have to lock myself in the bathroom until she leaves... on my birthday... I don’t know how to cope with this because she is the main cause of my anxiety (psychologists opinion, not my own). 

Overall: I have a shitty relationship with my mum and my anxiety is through the roof thinking that she is going to turn up unannounced on my 19th. This is to the extent that I have genuinely considered doing something to put myself in hospital or a morgue. Can anyone help me please??? I really just want to enjoy my day after the shitty year I’ve had...

The loneliness is really bad. I never did drugs or drank really. I workout religiously but never socialize. I just don't know what to do.

12,"I don't know what is going on. I have been cutting contact with everyone because the smallest things are pissing me off. The other night I was talking on the phone with a new girl I was talking to and I had mentioned that I smoke weed. My mom had heard and the following day she was terribly pissed off at me. 

The best way I can describe her behavior was shaming me and neglecting me. This wound up triggering me to become suicidal. Normally I would check myself into a psych hospital so that I am safe but I just got released from one a few weeks ago. 

Right now I have a belt on my bed that I had used earlier today to try and choke myself - I fear I will loose the strength to keep fighting this and eventually set the belt up so that I hang myself.

Last night I said goodbye to my family which then triggered them all freaking out and getting the cops involved. Even my psychiatrist wound up calling me because of what I had said to my family. 

Because my family got my psychiatrist involved I now want to get a new doctor but am unsure if that is the right thing to do. I would actually like to go back to one of my old psychiatrists since he had me on a high dose of seroquel which numbed me enough so that my mental problems didn't surface. I am currently undergoing maintenance ECT so I am surprised my suicidal ideation came back. 

Should i just contact my current pdoc and schedule a emergency session? I am just a tad afraid that this recent incident will have him upset with me and I can't handle and more people being disappointed in me it might seriously push me over the edge.

15,"So this only happened to me once, after I finally recovered from Montezuma’s Revenge (intestinal infection) while in Mexico. 

I got out of bed after basically two full days of puking and shitting. It was by far the most disgusting experience I’ve ever had. Anyways, I was finally feeling pretty good again, but my buddy wasn’t in the room so I was wondering where he was. 

For some reason, my wonder of where he could be started a panic-induced craze, in which I couldn’t stop picturing the endless possibilities of the entire universe, not to mention where he was. The infinite options of the universe started to become extremely overwhelming, and I began pacing around trying to stop thinking about these impossible-to-comprehend numbers. 

Within a minute of this starting, my shirt was literally dripping in sweat, I was mumbling to myself, and made up math equations/shapes were dancing around in my head and in front of me.  I realized I had to find someone else to calm me down, or I was going to have a heart attack (as my heart felt like it was rapidly beating out of my chest).

I knocked on my friends moms room, paced up and down the hallway until she opened up.  I think my panic freaked her out, she had no idea what to do either, so she drew me a bath.  Instantly i took all my clothes off directly in front of her (which would usually be very uncomfortable for both of us). Took about 30-45 minutes to get my heart beat back to normal and to stop sweating profusely.

My friend said I kept repeating some ridiculous shit like “12 billion, too many number, too many” and apparently I was shaking as well.  However my math hallucinations only lasted a couple minutes once I was around other humans. I think that this is the closest I’ve ever been to dying.

17,"If this is not the right place to post, I apologise. I was told by the /r/relationships mods that this post would fit better here.

 

If you take the time to read this all, I would appreciate it profusely. If you take my affairs seriously, I would appreciate that too. If it helps, I am an INFJ with ADHD and she is an INTJ.

I have been with my girlfriend since around July-August last year. This is the first relationship that the two of us have been in. When we first got together, everything was perfect. I was happy and so was she. I had never really been as happy as I was throughout my early experiences of the relationship. I was allowed to see her whenever I wanted, her parents, being her Mother and her Mother's boyfriend, liked me and we would spend almost every weekend together as well as a lot of time throughout the holidays. All this wouldn't last long.

December came around, especially the December holidays, and she began to act strangely. I believe I saw her once when she stayed over at my place before this situation, but that is irrelevant. We were talking on Skype towards the start of the holidays. I knew a bit about the fact that she was eating inconsistently, but my idiocy told me that it wasn't that bad until this call, plus I had never experienced a friend go through something like this. She told me that she hadn't eaten in two or so days and had only had a glass of water or something that day. I was shocked. I began to worry a lot. We saw each other once after this when we went to the city together. I told her that day that I wanted her to promise me she would eat at least breakfast and dinner for me. We spent the whole day together. It was one of the best days of my life. Just my girlfriend who I love so much and I spending time together in the city. This would be perhaps the last day of the ""old"" her. She used to always listen to me and treat me like I was the only one for her. She was always there to respond to my messages and she would always be there for me. We would never argue.

It was perhaps before this outing or after, I can't remember, but she told me that one of her male friends offered her marijuana. I had a minute amount of jealousy in relation to this dude, but for some reason this sparked it like crazy. I messaged the guy and basically said ""no disrespect, but don't ever offer my girlfriend marijuana again"". Keep in mind this guy only associates with her at school during classes as well as over the internet and the three of us go to the same school. He kind of showed her and they talked over the phone about it. It pissed her off that I did that. Around the same time, I found out about a male ""family friend"" which she had never told me about. I kind of got jealous about him as well, but he comes up more later on.

She suddenly began to message me less, sometimes even leaving my messages on ""read"". I didn't understand why she did this, so I usually sent multiple messages. Her responses were often quite short as well. I began having dreams in which she would cheat on me. I told her about these and she said she'd never do that to me. I kept having these dreams, though, and I believe it has left the permanent fear of her cheating on me in the back of my mind.

She went to see her Dad for a few weeks, and I went to see my extended family. We began to have small arguments over text. Eventually, I said ""fuck you"" to her due to a misunderstanding and she said ""fuck you too"". I then called her a bitch. I promised her afterwards that I would never call her that again and we stopped arguing for a bit.

When we had gotten back, she stayed over at mine and it was only when I saw her this time that I realised she was in dire straits. Her weight was so low. Her heart rate was too and it made me sad to look at her. She often didn't seem happy and cheerful and she was on her phone a lot instead of actually investing herself in me. We did some things intimately, but months later she told me she only did them for me during that time and not for herself as she was not excited. I remember sitting in a dark room with her for around an hour and telling her that I was worried about her. On a side note, the guy who offered her marijuana called while she was over and she let it ring out. We both sat in complete silence afterwards.

The morning her Mother picked her up, she went to see the doctors. She later called me and told me all these things, including that she could have a cardiac arrest. She was later sent to hospital where she stayed for a week or more. After this, stuff was tough for her. She was away from school for a long time and I began to get upset because she didn't let me see her in hospital or afterwards to make sure she was okay and give her some comfort. I began to find out minor things that I didn't know but they aren't worth mentioning. Basically, I began to develop trust issues.

We began to argue more and more. I began spamming her. It was a habit that I still haven't gotten rid of. Many of these bad habits are only worse now. On the weekend before she went back to school, I logged into her Facebook account, looked through her stuff and messaged her friend a little. I was becoming a chronic stalker. She was really angry and threatened to leave me, and I cut myself for the first time ever that night. I promised I would never log into any of her accounts again. The next weekend I did it again, only worse. I logged into almost all of her accounts and found out about old crushes and such. I also kept calling and calling and texting and texting her all night. She heard me yell and chuck stuff on the phone. I had become a demon or some shit. This persona has taken me over recently and I've never seen it before. I was up all night and I got no sleep. Neither of us went to school on Monday and she told me she was leaving me. This is what began my major struggles. I must mention that on Monday I cried for the first time since the death of my Father three years prior. I cry almost every day now.

She was back with me again two to three weeks later, but her parents hated me. I would not be allowed to see her and this would be a leading cause of our augments, even now. By now, I was perhaps the most jealous person in existence. There is too much shit to talk about from now on, so I will just mention the major things. I waited ages to be able to see her again, at times almost proving to her parents that I was worthy but then messing it up with some argument. I would often chuck my phone and yell in these arguments. I now have a broken phone. I had developed depression and anxiety that had eventually become crippling.

The family friend I mentioned earlier saw her one night with his Mother. Eventually, my girlfriend and him spent some time from what I was aware of ""talking and listening to music"" in her room. I only recently found out it was a little more. She is a chronic liar, and only now has she promised to tell me the truth. I found out that they shared a flask and she got drunk and did some crazy stuff after he left that could have potentially hurt her. Her parents shouldn't let her drink because they know she isn't responsible with alcohol, but they do. She also talked about me, even though it was positively, but it made me sad that she lied about bringing me up with him. I got extremely jealous about them being in the same room together as well as the fact that she didn't text me once while he was over but she was on her phone often earlier in the year at my place. It made me sad that he could see her but I couldn't, so we argued and I kept her up. Shit like this would happen sometimes. Somehow, she still loved me. She would often tell me that she was leaving, and then she wouldn't leave.

Between June and August we didn't argue. I even got to see her a few times outside of school in July, one of them being the day at my place. Things were eventually looking up for us. We'd be happy often and she'd share things with me (not as much as I thought, though, as I wasn't aware of her drinking). Something I noticed, though, is that when things were better between us I would often research information on her disorder and how I could help her for hours instead of doing homework and other important things. I was so worried about her.

I had to mess things up though, like usual, and we began arguing again. It started off with little things like jealousy and then they got bigger and bigger. One of these arguments was when I screamed and broke my phone. Every day was just miserable for us and it was all my fault. I ruined her fucking birthday and I will never forgive her for that. I was happy to give her the present that I bought her along with the ones that my little sister made for her that day. We had a surprisingly good day at school. I made her smile and laugh a lot and it made me very happy. It was very cute. I got home and ruined it all. It was all because that family friend posted a birthday message on her Facebook page with hearts and the term ""gorgeous"" used in reference to her. She gave it a heart. All my message got was a thumbs up, but she private messaged me and said thanks and that she loves me. I only focused on the negatives, got jealous and had a meltdown.

The next day was her last day at school and that I would see her for a long time, because she was leaving on a trip to another country. Our day at school was pretty silent. We were together and it mostly consisted of apologies from me, silence, hugs and kisses. Not much else. My heart hurt and I could tell her's did even more so. After I had said goodbye to her, Mum picked me up. I got in the car and cried.

While she was away, I got both jealous and upset because she liked a picture that was put up by her ""family friend"". It kind of promoted the use of alcohol. As dumb as it may sound, I get jealous because she doesn't like my posts anymore yet she likes the posts of other guys. Anyway, this resulted in a bit of an argument, but she would ignore me for two weeks or so after this. I kept spamming her and spamming her until a few days later she told me that she doesn't love me and that I'm a cunt and blah blah. She cried and I should have just left her alone, but I didn't. It made me extremely sad, ultimately unable to go to school some days and do my school work. I was even unable to eat. I just sat in my room and stalked her until the early hours of the morning.

I stayed home one day and logged into one of her accounts. This began something again, and I started doing it more often. I felt bad and I told Mum about it, but I couldn't stop. She was unaware for a bit. She told me suddenly a few days later ""I'm sorry, I love you"" but she continued to ignore me. Eventually we talked and I planned to give her some space and let her initiate things again, which she promised to do in a few days time. I then implied that I logged into her accounts. She found out and told me that she can't do this anymore and that she doesn't love me. Shit got way out of hand. - On a side note I should add that her google search history proved that she really did love me. In many arguments I accused her of not loving me.

The next day I found out that the ""family friend"" was actually her first kiss, and I thought I was throughout our entire relationship. He kissed her when she was in grade six or seven. She never had feelings for him, she was just curious and he convinced her to. It made me so jealous. That night I got really angry at her and spammed her like I usually do. I cut myself a lot and sent her photos over and over again. Since then, stuff has just been crazy. Of course she informed her parents which has fucked things even worse. I think what has happened since needs little explanation:

Her parents think she doesn't associate with me anymore and that I'm blocked, but she does. She still messages me every day online, even though 75% of the time I begin the conversations. I don't know how she feels. One moment she says we're only taking a break, the next she is saying that it's over. She was saying that she doesn't love me, then she said ""I love you but I can't do this anymore"". She then denied that she meant that days later. Currently, she refuses to say anything. She's a liar, but she's trying not to lie at the moment. I still love her very much. I am worried about her. I don't know what to do without her. She is telling me that she doesn't have any motivation anymore and that she's sick of life pretty much. I don't want to lose her. I feel like it's all my fault, but she said it's also her Mum's boyfriend. He's a dickhead to her. She hates him. I should probably add that the friend that offered her marijuana is actually being pretty supportive of me, which is nice. We've kind of cleared shit up between us. Of course, on the first day back at school she didn't even look at me and she hasn't been at school any other days because she's sick.

I don't know what to do without her. It's hard to explain, but I don't have many friends to talk to, let alone friends that have been through the same shit. I've lost a lot of friends in recent times. My only real close friend from school will probably be dropping out, so I may have no one. I know that I will probably never be allowed to see her outside of school again thanks to her parents, and that makes me sad. I don't know how to stop talking to her. I often won't stop calling, even when she asks me to and informs me that she wants to go to bed. I rely on her for my emotional well being. I don't want the relationship to end. What we had was amazing and I had never been that close to someone. I don't want therapy because I'm anxious about talking to people that I don't know face-to-face. I'm worried about her well being. I'm worried about what will happen to her. I have trouble not being in a relationship with her, and I can't imagine just being friends. If anybody's here telling me to ""stop talking"" to her or end the relationship, I find it impossible to do that even though we don't really have a relationship right now. I want to start a relationship with her again. I can't just let her free because I've shared so many things with her that I would never share with anyone else. I also promised her many things. This whole situation is ruining myself, her and my family.

I need help somehow. I'm not sure how to stop fucking things up or what I should do right now. She's on my mind 24/7. Questions are welcome and appreciated. If any of this doesn't make sense, please request a clearer explanation. I'm sorry, I am a dumb fifteen year old. My mind often flutters off while I write things like this so the composition of my thoughts might be bizarre to some people. Just one of the many perks of having ADHD, haha. There's a lot more to this than it seems. Feel free to private message me too. Thank you very much and kind regards. Your help means the world to me.

**tl;dr: Keep fucking up in my relationship and doing the same things. I rely on her for my emotional/mental well-being. Her parents finally let me see her again and then I proved that I am not worthy to them. I'm not sure where to go from here. I am worried about her, too. She seems unstable and I am concerned that her state will deteriorate.** ",14Oct2018,1

It’s completely taken control of my life and I’m in a constant state of anxiety as it never leaves my mind (Which probably doesn’t help because i’ve heard hair loss is a symptom of stress, so it becomes a cycle)

23,When I’m by myself trying to get to sleep I end up depressed and wanting to end everything. I’ve been struggling to sleep for months and most days I just feel like absolute shit (both physically and emotionally) and I don’t know what’s causing it. I’ve tried talking with close friends to try and figure out what’s causing this but I’ve not been able to put my finger on it. At the moment it’s half 4 in the morning and I’m really tired but I just can’t sleep. There’s a few times where I’ve done some things to try and cause pain for myself which has helped stop the bad feelings but then they return the next day. I’m also getting constant headaches throughout the day probably due to lack of sleep.

24,"Now this is my first post, and the only reason I made a Reddit. This post is gonna be detailed and long, so be prepared. Anyway, any help I’d appreciate.

So I’ve been dealing with loads of problems for a while. The one that I most deal with is paranoia. I get paranoid a lot. One instance that I can remember is when a woman was across the street from my house and was talking at a phone looking at my house. For some reason I automatically thought she was scoping out my house, so I grabbed a bat and locked all doors and windows. I thought about all day until I went to sleep, and that leads me to the next thing. Sleep. Sometimes when I go to sleep, things haunt my mind. Sometimes I think somebody’s beside me watching me, so I open my eyes and keep them open, until I repeat this multiple times. I don’t watch horror movies or anything like that regularly, but when I do most of the time it doesn’t happen to me. It’s really fucking annoying, and it’s been affecting my sleep. I also hear EXTREMELY loud noises sometimes that I know don’t exist the second I’m about to go to sleep.

Another thing I face is anxiety. Usually I’m okay, but when I do something I’m slightly unsure of sometimes, I have a panic attack, and they sometimes are really bad. I also often misunderstand people and they get mad at me, so this affects my interactions and increases my “what if I mess up” mindset.

Finally, I just can’t do things sometimes. I am extremely fidgety most of the time, so sometimes I force myself to unplug electronics so I could read, do work etc. Even then, I never focus. I just get up and do something, like crush ice or lay on the floor. I know a lot of people do this, but it affects my grades, my relationships with people shit like that.

Finally, I get recurring nightmares. I have nightmares of the same scenarios, one being trapped in a school where there’s loads of people trying to kill me, I have to sacrifice myself for others and they get pretty bad. I’ve had them my whole life though, so I just think it’s my brain being stupid, but I’ve also lost lots of sleep due to these as well.

I also don’t feel nearly as emotion as I once had, I get stuck on lots of things, and I don’t trust anyone, but those things I cannot explain due to how long the explanation would be and how personal they are.

Any ideas would help. Thanks.",14Oct2018,1

Trouble with people, keeping a job, stating focused, getting food, mental and physical health, lack of direction or goals, feelings of failure.

They only really seem to come out when I’m going through heavier than normal anxiety. It’ll be the strangest things you can think of. IE, I’ll be driving on a clear day, and start imagining how the view in front of me on the road would look flipped (completely stupid right?) or I could be in a room at work and I’ll start imagining that it’s “floating”. Completely stupid things, that I KNOW aren’t true but my head plays on repeat, 100x, until I’m questioning my reality and sanity. I’ll later laugh at how crazy it all is. I’ve always had an insanely good imagination, plus a tendency to be obsessive. but oh man, when my anxiety gets bad I will literally drill the most stupid shit into my head.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, whenever I'm around girls, I get super anxious and nervous and it doesn't even matter if I know them or not, I just start acting all weird just because I see them. Second of all, I've been feeling this lack of human affection lately and I feel like something is missing and I think I figured it out. I want to be in a relationship with someone that doesn't mind how dark or inappropriate my humor can be and I just want someone to share my life with and my anxiety with girls doesn't help with that and neither does me having low self esteem. My family always praises me and tells all my siblings and cousins to follow in my footsteps but I still don't feel happy about the way I am and who I am. Every single day I make multiple mistakes that are very minor and don't really matter that much but I still regret them and heavily dwell on them and I constantly kind of beat myself up over these mistakes and because of this, I'm always in constant fear of rejection since I feel like a minor mistake might completely change someone's opinion of me since I've had experiences like that in the past. I've just started watching a lot of shows and movies about romance lately and I usually cry a little at the end of them and it makes me feel worse about myself, pessimistically thinking that I'll never have something as special as what's happening in the show and I'll never experience the same feelings toward someone else and they have the same feelings towards me.

The worst part is, I have a lot of friends and family that help me get through the day but at night, whenever my family is asleep or my friends go offline, I feel super lonely and I feel like there's not much to look forward to the next day unless I'm hanging out with my friends in real life or doing something fun. All the stress of school and my parents constantly pushing me to get ""perfect"" grades has just beaten me down over the past couple years and I feel no motivation to do anything. The only time I feel truly happy throughout the day is either when I'm streaming video games and I have at least 1 other person to talk to, if none of my other friends are online, or whenever I play video games with all my friends but the rest of the time I feel sad inside at least a little. I just feel like I need some time with my friends to travel or do something memorable with them and maybe meet someone that I click with in the process because I feel like I will never get past this obstacle without that but that isn't really an option for me as of now because of school and the lack of money and time.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking about how i want attention and in this moment it was having cancer to have attention and sympathy.

Then i thought, if i literally want cancer because i want a way out and attention (i want cancer because im tired of the way i always have to stay up for worrying about everything and hating myself) and then i thought death is seen as the worst thing that can happen to you, so death compared to worrying about a bit of pudgy stomach or worrying about how these little people ill never see again equals wanting to die over that, death is worse. So in the moment i let go of the worry and stop caring about those tiny things because in the end, those things are so stupid and little and not going to ever have a second thought in the future because death is so much bigger than those things. So then i thought if im not scared of anything not even death, even welcoming it, i thought that i can do ANYTHING i can be crazy and use this as an artistic method of being crazy and adventurous and doing whatever the fuck i want and created something crazy and different because my limit is death and death is the absolute end to everything. Nothing should scare me. No small interaction no homework, no stupid small minded teacher or student upset because i was two minutes late for a presentation. How is that even comparable. Use this method i want to be crazy i want to not be scared of anything because death doesn’t scare me. 

I have so much self-loathing yet a very narcissistic view of myself. I kind of think im incredibly different and i am going to become this person that is really successful and creative and has done something to change the world of art of whatever because I just want to be incredible at everything but I don’t always try or am not able to put my full effort into things because I have ADHD and am very hesitant to start things, procrastinate and get extremely sarcastic.

I believe this is why i am borderline personality because i can have this mentality of thinking this extreme of how I can let go of those little tiny things and then those big things that everyone cares about but i don’t want to care about those things because death is supposed to be worse but it seems that everyone thinks that being late, missing class, having an awkward interaction is worse than death thats how it seems to me.

BUT then i can literally have an extreme reaction to THE STUPIDEST THINGS. Like coming home and paul playing games or the coffee machine not being pushed back. Or hearing donna say something stupid. Or shareef not driving me when it’s my only option to get there. 

Im actually insane. I need to let it go. Find a balance. Not to want death but not to be uptight and care about little things. I want my mood to be stable. This is all in my head and on the outside i am almost normal expect from being awkward but im functional and get shit done yet i have these thoughts often and I’m not extremely depressed nor have i been diagnosed with depression. I get out of bed i go to school but these thoughts are like a little satanic shadow in my head that flicks a switch between acting normal or acting out. When will i have a public meltdown. I am scared for when something serious happens and it can be possible that i have a reaction that’s extremely inappropriate or just go full psycho. I don’t picture myself ever harming myself or anyone but i can picture it a tiny bit if something really bad happened that just tipped me off into the deep end.",14Oct2018,1
33,"my name is macy and im seventeen years old. i have a lot of great stuff happening in my life. im at the top of my class, i have really good grades, im super involved at school and in my community and i have a lot of friends that care about me enough to ask me whats wrong when i seem upset. i have a cat named squishy that i really love and she always seems really happy to see me. i think those things should make me really happy.

they do , too. i have a lot of big goals that i want to finish. and my mom is trying to help me with my issue but she isn't really successful and i think part of that is because im not really honest with her about it. 

i was bakeracted and diagnosed with depression almost five years ago because i was planning on committing suicide, but because its been so long and i have a hard time being honest im not really receiving much treatment anymore and it got better at one point but its really bad again.

i cant stop thinking about hurting myself and what everyones lives would be like if i did. what would happen at school. would they commemorate me? just forget i existed? would everyone be okay? would they hate me for dying?

normally when i feel like this i used to talk to my boyfriend about it. we were together for two and a half years and we were naive like always and talking about love and futures since the beginning. but he said i got too sad and i wasnt interested enough in doing things with him lately so he broke up with me almost two months ago.

right now i was watching a cute romance show and everything stills reminds me of him and makes me sad, and im just not good at all anyway and i went onto snapchat to see if he'd responded yet because even just seeing a response might cheer me up. but he left my message on read. and i just really want to die for a million reasons and i have no one to tell it to so i thought it might be good for me to say it somewhere at least. i feel like a seventh grader again and i listen to the same music i did back then again and i think i might lose focus of my goals some time soon and just give up on being alive

im sorry if anyone actually read all that, i just really needed to vent and i didnt know where to go. im sorry. thank you for maybe being concerned for a second in between but i just needed to vent and ill probably be fine. i made a pact with myself that ill at least do my best to make it to 37, so i don't think i'll hurt myself really. thank you, im sorry",14Oct2018,1

I'm not sure if this is some kind of side effect from my constant fear of abandonment. 

I start to get panicky and unsure and unsure about myself which makes me overthink everything I do which bring me more anxiety and when I start to feel anxious I want to talk to him about it but then I like I'm bothering him or being clingy becuase we just spent time together and now I'm calling him crying becuase I'm having an anxiety attack becuase I'm alone and I never know how to explain that I dont like being alone and how shitty I feel when I'm alone

35,"This is going to be a vent (kinda) about what’s been going on the past 6 months... a lot has happened and I don’t know if I know how to deal with things without the help of a professional. Sorry in advance for the long post but I need advice...  

I (21F) was helping my mom take care of my grandfather for over a year because his cancer came back. So that meant no working which I didn’t mind because we were very close. 

We moved in February so my mom would be closer to work, for me it meant being far away from the one friend I kept after getting out of a very bad relationship where I was ripped from every relation I had ... and starting over. That friend also recently turned out to be “toxic” and that’s the last thing I need right now so current friend count: zero. 
Also in February I started dating my current boyfriend who is amazing and I am so lucky to have him. 

In May my grandfather passed, his doctor said he had max 3 months. It was more like 2 weeks.

I cannot begin to explain how bonded me and my him were... he was my world. He was my grandfather, my father, my best friend, just everything to me. I was never in this world without him in my life... so obviously his passing shattered me...I don’t think I have ever felt this much pain. 

The first few months weren’t as bad as things are now... in a way it felt like he was on vacation. Like he would walk through the door any second. And I knew that wasn’t happening but again all of this is hard to explain. 

The past 2 months have been really bad for me. Everything has been hitting me really hard and I’m crying everyday. So I think I’m really depressed, I always feel tired and I’m always down. Very rarely am I truly happy and not putting on a mask. Some days I question what the point is of me and my life. I don’t do anything, the only people I regularly talk to is my boyfriend, my mom, and my dog.  

I have recently been trying to get a part time job and get back to working maybe make a friend since I have NONE, but my social anxiety is through the roof. (Also PTSD) 

 The fact that I apply, never get a call back or get a call and go for an interview but someone else was better qualified ... will I ever actually get a job? 

I don’t go anywhere besides my boyfriends (who lives an HOUR away), can’t really do much with no income so I sit at home waiting for call backs. I even called the stores myself but it was always the same “we have your application and we will call you back and let you know”.  

I’m just at a low, I’m trying to put myself back together but I’m slipping... boyfriend says he thinks therapy would help me a lot, no meds just talking.  But I’m honestly scared of therapy. The idea of blurting out deep feelings to a stranger is terrifying... but that’s where I am... my only outlet/friend is my boyfriend who doesn’t live that close by so I’m pretty lonely and really broken.

I have finally came to the conclusion that I need to reach out and get some form of therapy. I have self diagnosed myself with some form of depression, anxiety and ptsd issues. These issues are currently causing strains in my family, workplace and sex life.

My question is, how exactly do I find the right therapist to go to? I know there are therapists that deal mainly with certain issues. But are there therapists that just deal with universal problems? Like would a specific therapist be able to deal with my family issues AND trouble in the bedroom? Or would I need to seek out two separate therapists?

Also, do you just google these therapists until you find one who has good reviews? This may sound like a really dumb question but I truly have no idea.

I am usually one who just sticks to himself and does not ask others for help. I've always been one to just figure it out on my own.

I later found out he specialises in psychobiology (behavioural neuroscience)

We did about 4-5 solo sessions and 3 dual sessions with him where he puts you into a state of trance (at the time had no idea this was happening as it wasn't communicated) which in turn puts your sub-conscious mind to a state of suggestibility.

&amp;#x200B;

He gave me some affirmations to memorise by saying twice a day and said that they will make me challenge people a bit more and that it would help with memory- this is after he built rapport and gained my trust, The affirmations were a form of suggestibiity (again didn't know this at the time as i trusted him) which made me question what they could mean which led to extremely deep traumatizing memories from a time in my life that was completely forgotten. My nervous system shut down, I had extreme pins and needles and weakness of muscles, Night sweats and a metallic taste in my mouth for about 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to go back and see him for clarity and help but he refused to see me. Its as if my psych has been completely altered/torn apart and my personality has been changed, all this happened about 10-11 months ago and I have still been having vivid flashbacks to my childhood.

Is it possible I had a dysfunctional brain due to emotional trauma and he has re established the broken connections through nlp/suggestibility, I know this is a debated topic in psychology and mental health but im left scratching for answers anywhere possible.

39,"My husband (42m) and I (41f) have been together since we were teenagers. Almost 3 decades. We've been married for 20 years. We have 4 teen kids.


He is clinically depressed. He has had a lot of trauma in his life and has struggled with severe depression since he was a child. He tried treatment for the depression about 10 years ago but really just ended up trying a couple prescriptions, therapy was never really pursued. He went a few times and  said he hated the process. Since that time he has gone untreated and has always been resistant to counseling or help.


I have my own issues. I am a hoarder, but on the mild end of the spectrum. I also have my own childhood traumas that make it very difficult to communicate in a direct manner, particularly in confrontation and I am very insecure and fearful of rejection. 


Our marriage is a good, intimate and happy one, but mental illness on both sides takes a large toll. My hoarding and issues cause his depression to become worse. In turn, I become depressed and my hoarding and lack of motivation make the house spiral out of control. 


We had a couple instances over the years where he told me he was thinking of divorce because of my issue. I tried to clean everything up and get rid of stuff but found it very hard to part with stuff. It was a huge task that I was overhwhelmed by. My husband did not help do any cleaning by this point because of the effects of depression and viewing it as my responsibility. I did not have the resources to pursue the mental help I needed and ended up relapsing. 


Over the last few years my husband has sunk deeper and deeper into depression. He began isolating himself, dropping friends and becoming disconnected from his family. He isolated himself to the point that I was his only friend and social interaction. He ordered a low dose of one of the medications he had tried years ago from another country online.

Recently he got a demanding job that is high stress and took up most of his free time as well. He no longer had time for the things that made him happy. The depression spiked and he withdrew even from me and the kids.

I became very depressed and the house spiraled out of control. I began thinking of going to a therapist to get help. However we have some high financial demands right now and I wanted to broach the subject with my husband. One of our kids was in need of therapy and so I started researching for him as well as myself, thinking I could see how his session went and then pursue it for myself.

Through all of this my husband and I were and are very much in love. It wasn't constant despair and our relationship was strained but intact. A few weeks again we were talking about getting tattoos to symbolize each other and making plans for the future. Then suddenly, a week ago, he told me that he wants a divorce.


I was completely blindsided and shellshocked. He says he loves me. In fact he gets very upset if that is questioned. He still wants me to be his wife, he wants the future we dreamed about but he needs a drastic change. He admitted that he has frequent suicidal thoughts but minimalizes that by saying that he's dealt with them since he was a kid and has no plan to kill himself. He says that he feels like he is watching himself do this to me and to himself but he can't stop it. He uses dissociation to disconnect himself emotionally. He acknowledged divorcing was a way to further isolate himself. He doesn't want to try when it comes to anything anymore. He says he feels like we have tried but then acknowledged but I've never been able to have what I need to be able to overcome my issues. Hoarding is an ocd illness and is almost never able to be overcome without professional help.  He also acknowledges he has not pursued help for himself. Depression is highly treatable with new medication and therapies that we're not even around years ago. Plus he did not pursue many options when he did go to the doctor years ago.


I immediately made an appointment with a therapist. I also have a friend who is a counselor who has been helping me. I've been working on all of my issues including abandonment and and security and communication. I've made drastic leaps in regards to hoarding. I'm learning to let go things that I never been able to you free myself from. I'm making personal progress and have every reason to believe that with professional help for us we could save our marriage. He even acknowledges at this point that it is not destroyed. He tries very hard to distance me because he is resolved in his decision. However there are lapses in that distance due to the intimacy and love between us.


I have begged him to seek professional help. He will not listen to reason from me. He has not spoken with anyone about this at all. He has no close friends. He has no support system. I am scared for him. And I'm terrified for the both of us. At the advice of my counselor I offered to help him find a Professional to help him. He yelled at me that he doesn't want help. I'm trying to think of anyone he could talk to that might help him at least seek help for himself. I know a divorce will send him further into a tailspin. I also know that any reprieve that comes will be temporary without help. We have kids that have their own emotional issues due to fall out of all of this. I believe we owe it to them to try to work things out. At very least he owes it to them to try and get help for himself. I just feel very desperate and destroyed and like I'm watching my entire world crumble and I have no power to stop it. I realize that I can't control him or anything in this situation and I can only control myself. I'm committed to getting help for myself and overcoming my problems. But I still can't give up hope on my marriage because I know that not trying is a mistake.


 I just want some somebody to tell me that he's not going to destroy our marriage when this is an opportunity to actually fix it. To actually heal our family. He said that's what he really wants but hes made his decision. Earlier this evening he acknowledged that if I was different and healthier that he would not do this. He's angry that I can't accept this. And it's because it's not rational. he's a rational man but I truly believe that he did not make this decision in a healthy frame of mind. He's in a lot of denial about his depression.I told him that I am getting help and that I'm making progress , all I'm asking for is time for him to see if he can hope. That he be open to the possibility that divorce may not be the only option for him. He he said okay but I have to be ready to accept that in a few months I'm going to be divorced. I think he's already felt stirrings of hope but is squashing it purposefully. And i think that if he were in a better frame of mind that he would never make this decision. I'm just at a loss what to do. I'm trying to focus on myself taking one step forword at a time. My heart leaves me no option but to hold on to hope. I know we both need to be getting help and invested to make it work. But it could work. And I'm heartbroken that he says that he loves me... That he's planning to do this to me and himself and his kids. I'm desperate to stop it but don't know what to do other than just to work on me and hope he sees it. I'm sorry for venting I'm just in such an emotional upheaval and I feel like I'm dying. If anyone has input I'd appreciate it.",14Oct2018,1

42,"Okay, so I’ve never posted anything on reddit before but I’m really in need of some life advice.

I am 19yo Male, I currently live at home with both of my parents, Mum doesn’t work and dad is a full time courier running his own business. For pretty much all my life I have been overweight. Dad smokes weed everyday, I found out when I was about 15yo but it didn’t really bother me that much. So everyday after work (I’m an apprentice plumber) I usually get home at around 4 he comes in just after me. But being at work all day he comes home sober, when dad is sober he gets ropable and will abuse anybody that doesn’t listen, has made the smallest mess around the house, he just needs to vent on something. This happens EVERYDAY. My parents are very abusing, all my life I’ve been called fat, useless, lazy, dumb cunt etc, I think it has finally got to me, they treat me like shit, refuse doing the smallest things to help me out in everyday life whilst doing all that and paying my older brothers bills. I have started smoking weed with the couple of mates that I have. I know it’s not the best thing to do but it really helps me out sometimes. I remember being young crying my eyes out when the parents would abuse me because it really got to me back then. At least 10 times I really made a big deal out of it and Mum sat down and apologised to me and said it won’t happen again. It’s obviously keeps happening.

I am 19yo and I know I should be able to handle this petty shit right? There’s so much more to it that isn’t said so I apologise if I sound like a bitch. I’m currently in tears writing this, depressed isn’t the right word because I live a good life and there’s people out there that would love to live my life. Every night I go and smoke weed out on the rock point (where the lighthouse is) and stare out into the ocean crying. I know that my family love me to death but I think it’d be easier if I wasn’t around then I wouldn’t get upset about shit. Right now I’m not suicidal but keep having stupid thoughts.

October 14
06:53 am

I have woken from my sleep and have come to some important realizations.
I woke in-part because of how hot my body temperature was under my covers with the ceiling fan off, but also because I had to urinate, and ALSO because I had a sort of bad dream that I think has taught me some things about my own psychology that has a bit of evidence behind it.

First I'll give details about the dream and then provide my analysis.

The dream:
I was lying down in bed, by myself, in a very small house of my own, in a very dark area of a city--late at night. The city was well-populated, other residential buildings surrounded mine, and there was surely other people in those buildings sleeping or trying to get some sleep just as I was. There were streets with street lights kind of off in the distance a bit--late night drivers slowly making their way down the roads. Not really making any noise.
But it was very quiet and still. Almost eerie. 
And what made it eerie was not so much the actual setting itself--which seemed to be a kind of typical, milktoast, urban setting (and the idea of living by myself seems to be a pleasant one in my conscious life), but the paranoia that was plaguing my mind was the most eerie thing of all.

As I lie down in this bed in my dream, which felt like a reality, my mind couldn't stop thinking that someone or perhaps even multiple people were staring at me in my bed through my two bedroom windows--which did not have the blinds down to keep others from possibly seeing me. I didn't have any evidence that someone was actually watching me there, but the idea of it was frightening in a very visceral way--to such a degree that when I actually woke up a moment ago, my body and mind had all of the symptoms of someone who had really just been spooked.
But the dream continues.
As I lie down and have these very paranoid thoughts about how someone might be watching me through my windows, I get up out of bed and shut the blinds on both of my windows--half expecting to see someone there staring at me with a wicked and ill-intentioned smile--which would have shaken me to my core.
So I close the blinds and take my cell phone off the charge.
The first thing I do is I think about sending my ex girlfriend (who left me in July of this year after we dated for about 6 months), a text message saying ""Hey, are you up?"" I don't actually recall sending the text-message, but I do recall thinking about doing so.
And from there, the dream ends, and I actually wake, use the bathroom, turn on my ceiling fan, and then proceed to think about how important it might be to write down this realization I've had before I fall back to sleep and can't remember the details of my dream or the analysis I had.

Analysis:
I managed to conclude that there is some evidence of me having some paranoid and even schizophrenic tendencies.
The feeling of fear that I had when my mind was racing and obsessing over the idea of someone staring at me through the windows was the same kind of fear that I experienced upon a few occasions after smoking marijuana between two and three years ago--when I was a periodic marijuana smoker and had a host of episodes.

Two of these episodes that I recall:

1. While I was living with several roomates and attending university, I smoked too much and got extremely paranoid. I called my friend into the room and told him I was scared. I legitimately lost my sense of reality--as I recall lying down on the floor, stomache-first, wrapping my arms around my friend's feet and legs because I was having a hallucination that the brown leather jacket underneath my futon was in fact a man underneath the futon, wearing that jacket and a fedora hat, and pointing a rifle at me. I thought my life was in danger. I cried and sobbed while my friend reassured me until I calmed down and the drug wore off.

2) Another such instance happened maybe four months later when I moved back in with my parents and my brother. My best friend came over to the house around noon to spend time with me, and seeing as my parents were not home and my brother, my friend, and I all enjoyed smoking, we smoked marijuana in my back yard. Maybe five mimutes after smoking, I felt the high coming on, and it made me feel good enough amd motivated to start cleaning up the house. As I was taking something to the garbage can outside of the house, the next-door neighbor's Dodge Charger pulled up into the driveway, and I hallucinated that it was a police vehicle. The police vehicles in my county were all Dodge Chargers.
In fear, I ran behind the house, warned my brother and friend that the police were present, and I quickly jumped into the swampy wetland behind my house and ran as fast as I possibly could into the deeps of the swamp. The water was probably 18 inches deep in some areas, and there is no reason to doubt that there were water moccasin snakes--poisonous snakes in that water, but my fear of the police was so great that the snakes didn't even cross my mind. I ran for maybe an entire mile while thinking that the police were shooting their guns at me. One of my shoes came off during my haste, and I never found it afterwards. My high came down after a few minutes, and I made my way back to my house without any issues--fully realizing the extent to which my mind had been deceiving me.

-------------------------------------------------

These two instances both have guns as a theme, and that is an interesting point to make considering that I've actually had several dreams with guns as a theme. In these dreams, I'm usually being pursued, and I always run, but I never get shot.

I think an important theme to highlight from the dream I just woke from was that the first person I thought of to comfort me was my ex girlfriend--who I've been devastatingly depressed over since our break-up, and who treated me awfully at the end of our relationship. Since our breakup, she has been very supportive--even loving towards me despite being lucid about us having a very clear separation. Since the decline of my happiness and mental health around June or so, I have looked to her for a lot of validation.

There is also something to say about the history of my passed two or three weeks. My mental health has been improving. I have gained the strength and conviction to pry myself from my typical comfort-seeking habit of video games (my daily escape from the despairs of my life--to which I have had an unhealthy relationship since high school) and do some very basic, elementary things that are not difficult for a healthy person to do, but are extremely difficult to do when you feel it necessary to comfort yourself with the instant gratification of video games.
Some of the things I've done in the passed couple of weeks have been:
-I spent several hours cooking a lovely dinner for my family (which I never do)
-I went to a gay pride event in a major city 90 minutes away (In Raleigh, NC) to show my solidarity with the gay community
-I attended a political science club meeting with the local state university which is 90 minutes away (in Raleigh)--a lovely experience, I might add. I was the fuel for most of the discussion we had on political/social issues 
-My mood and performance at my job (as a produce clerk at a local grocery store) has improved significantly
-I registered to vote in the upcoming midterm elections and did the research and filled out the paperworm necessary to cast an absentee ballot
-I applied for loads and loads of jobs in this passed week. I've been trying to get a job in the paralegal field since March of this year, but I usually can't bring myself to apply to places because I anticipate that I'll not be accepted, and it's much more immediately gratifying to play my video games. Applying at places feels like a lot of work for me, and I'm very proud of myself for having the strength to continue trying.

One concern I have is that these instances of me doing 'good' and 'healthy' things are kind of... manic, perhaps?
It's like... I get this short window--a short boost of confidence to extracate myself from my elongated period of despair for just a moment, and I do something very elementary and simple that any healthy person would be able to do without it necessarily being a chore or something that's even worth being proud of.
I'm just fearful that I will not continue to do these 'good' things. The ideal is that these 'good' things become regular parts of my lifestyle as someone who aspires to achieve much greater things in the future--like finishing a doctorate degree in Political Science and becoming a professor, aggressively pursuing civic action on a host of major issues including climate change (I invoke the urgency of the most recent UN climate study), poverty, the crimes of US imperialism, civil rights, etc etc.

I was wondering if engaging in psychotherapy would be a worthwhile endeavor for possibly leading me in the right direction. Pushing me to become the best version of myself that I am capable of being. Not falling back into poor habits that are symptoms of poor mental health. Poor mental health in my life is the result of despair from love-life disappointments, underemployment (and unfulfilling employment), lack of community and a sense of belonging, poor family relations and home conditions, fear of the political climate and the future of my well-being and the well-being of others...
It's a mess.
And I'm hoping that I can make it over these hurdles.

Anyway... that's my spill. Hopefully this stream of consciousness written out in long-form can somehow be beneficial to my own improvement. I'll leave it here.",14Oct2018,1
48,"Little warning, post is kind of sexually graphic, not sure the demographics of this sub.

TLDR: I procrastinate a lot of important things and disregard my health in order to fulfill my desire to raw dog ladyboy prostitutes. I regularly like girls and don’t even like guys. What’s wrong with my brain, even putting the fact that they’re ladyboys aside, why do I allocate so much time for something that doesn’t even make sense for me to like?

So I’m a 21 year old male, for some background, now I’ll get straight to the point.

Basically about a year ago I started low balling ladyboy(my bad for the non PC language it’s just what they call themselves here) prostitutes as a hobby to see how low I could get them to go. Occasionally actually going visit them if i could get them down to an affordable price range (usually about $30-$40). I kept this up like once or twice a month for about a year, was losing max $100 a month which isn’t a lot but I could’ve been spending it on something else still.

Now I’m not working anymore so I’ve just been trying to get them to do it free, sometimes I’ll tell them we can record it then she can sell the video. Doesn’t work nearly as much as the low balling but I’m desperate and it works very rarely. And the thing is I don’t really have any severe lack of girls(I like girls if I’m confusing you) 

So today I go see this one (who actually was a dime btw) that let me for free. I’m typing this as I walk back to the subway actually. Basically I get there and the usual stuff, then we’re on the bed sucking each other off (lol it sounds so weird actually typing this shit out why the hell do I do it) then she says to fuck her, so we get in the position, she lubes up her butt and then just doesn’t give me a condom and keeps gesturing for me to put it in. This actually has happened before and I ask for a condom, but this time I was like fuck it she’s clean and good looking so I put it in and instantly regret it but still kept going. Thinking to myself the whole time wtf am I even doing right now I could get aids or at the least some disease that’ll cost a few bills to cure. So we switch positions and I ask for a condom, she gives it, and then all of the sudden I feel good again, but then we stop to suck each other off again for a few mins and she asks me to fuck her again, not offering a condom again and I said fuck it AGAIN and put it in raw. We did that for a bit then we finished up and I’m walking to the subway right now.

Basically my question is why the fuck do I even do this shit? I don’t even like guys so what’s up with me. I didn’t mention it either but this shit is very time consuming bartering with these ladyboys and getting all excited and horny but being let down most of the time. I procrastinate a lot of important productive things to make time for this bad habit. Why can’t I just be happy with girls? Do I need sex like every other day to be satisfied? Am I bisexual or gay but can’t admit it? Seriously open to any answer, this shit takes up a lot of my life not even mentioning the fact I could get some disease with the shit I’m pulling.",14Oct2018,1

50,"NSFW warning, post gets a bit graphic

TLDR; Why do I let my sexual desire get in the way of everything and take up so much time? Why does it get so bad that I’m willing to raw dog a ladyboy prostitute, side note, why do I even feel the need to fuck ladyboys when I’ve liked girls my whole life and never had any feelings for any guy?

A little background, I’m a 21 year old male. Now I’ll just get right into it.

So basically about a year ago I started doing this thing where I’d lowball ladyboy(my bad for not being PC it’s just what they call themselves here) prostitutes to see how low I could get them and occasionally going to see them if I got them to go low enough(usually around $30-$40). I’d do this about once or twice a month which would lose me max around $100 every month which isn’t much but still I could have been spending it on something else. And the thing is in reality I like girls if this wasn’t weird enough already. And I can’t even think of doing anything sexual with a real guy, or a masculine person or however you want to phrase it.

So cut to the past month or so, I don’t have a job anymore, going to school, so I cant really low ball them as all the money I have goes for food and rent. So I started just kind of seeing if they’d do it for free, sometimes saying they can record it and sell the video. This rarely works however and for every day I don’t get one to accept my ridiculous request I get more and more desperate and just want it more and more til the point it’s all I can think about really. I can’t understand it because I’m not horrible with real girls and I feel like I get enough to sustain my sanity. Do I need sex like every other day to stay sane? Am I gay but can’t admit it? Idk

So just today I actually got one of them to agree to it, and she was a dime actually which surprised me that’d she’d do it free, but anyways. I get there(which took me like 2 hours to get there yes I’m that desperate) and everything’s good, we get on the bed, suck each other off a bit(it sounds so weird typing this out why tf do I do it lol), then eventually she tells me to fuck her so she lubes up her butt a bit and gestures me to put it in without using a condom. This has actually happened to me before and I ask for a condom, but this time I was like fuck it she’s clean and good looking so I’ll go for it. I could actually feel myself torn between whether I should or shouldn’t. So I put it in raw, regret it instantly, but keep going anyways cause I’m an idiot scum bag. Eventually we stop to suck each other off again, then after that she wants me to put it back in, again not offering a condom, and I fucking did it again smh. So eventually we finish, I’m thinking about posting about it on reddit cause I feel like an absolute ‘degenerate’ wondering why I do this stuff. Now I’m here.

Basically what I want to know is why do I do this shit to myself? It’s very time consuming (very very time consuming) and frustrating trying to get a damn prostitute to fuck you for free let alone a ladyboy prostitute which are like 100x rarer. I procrastinate many many more important things and it’s getting to the point where I’m stagnating in life but every time that urge comes I feel powerless to resist. Not to mention the fact that I could get a disease from the shit I’m pulling.",14Oct2018,1

53,"For some background, my best friend and I live with his girlfriend and a friend of ours. He's 20, I'm 19. Not sure if age bears any relevance, but I'm wording things as best I can right now. 

He and I both struggle with bipolar disorder. It's one of the reasons that we are as close as we are, having reached a point where he is basically family to me and vice versa. Which made it extremely hard to hear that he was going to admit himself. I know it's for the best. He's been extremely depressive, and the fact that he's in hospital now means that he hasn't given up. Realistically, I do know that it's a good thing. But that doesn't make it less painful.

The house feels empty, I feel empty, and I'm almost angry with time and the world for just carrying on while we're stuck in this limbo. I can't stop crying. It's hard to feel anything but hurt when you know that the person that you're closest to is hurting to the degree where they do not feel safe. It's a situation I've been in too. It scares me, in a way. Because I know that the hospitalization is temporary, but this pronounced absence keeps worming its way into my head and making me wonder, what if it wasn't? 

Im trying to just keep going while this is all happening. I'm going to a play rehearsal today. I'll be going to work tomorrow. But I feel empty. It's hard to keep food down at this point.

Encouraging people to reach out to those they're concerned about while simultaneously getting frustrated and bitching about the distant friend you've not heard from in months is not helping anyone. Putting the idea in people's heads that because they have the odd down day or they get nervous about certain situations, they must be suffering with a mental illness, is not helping anyone. I haven't felt this on edge and incapable of maturely dealing with difficult things in a long time and seeing people bleat about depression and anxiety in such a hollow, hypocritical, self serving manner has really taken its toll on me. I've pushed away more people than I care to count for various reasons over the past week or so and I genuinely feel like this week which was supposed to make people struggling feel reassured that they're not alone has made things a hell of alot worse.

55,"Are there certain anti anxiety medications that are any of the following:

- can be taken as needed rather than every day?
- that dont cause weight gain or kill my sex drive or cause insane fatigue?


i think thats it. something thats one or both of those.

i dont have a lot of trust in psychiatrists bc they tend to minimize the side effects and shrug them off. one time i gained 30 pounds on a medication in 17 days, in college. when i had asked when she suggested the medication if it caused weight gain. “maybe but youre young you can burn it off...” another doc prescribed one that i had previously read can cause severe fatigue. she likewise shrugged it off. i took it and had to leave work one day i was so tired. dont even know how i made the drive home safely, and then fell sleep for 30 straight hours. 

basically i have enough of an anxiety problem that i feel like i need help beyond the talk therapy, but its not so bad that it makes those side effects worth it. i ended up trying a few things over the years (that was 15 years ago), and the sever side effects caused more anxiety than the anxiety itself!

and finally i do believe i tried clonazepam in 2007-2008 (i cant 100% remember but a quick google that sounds right maybe), and it was somethibg i took as needed and it seemed to do okay, id take a half dose. my only complaints is it woukd make me feel kind of mentally fuzzy, and also id hve these intense bad dreams. though those are tolerable

Later that day she emailed me introducing herself, asked one or two basic questions and then asked when I’d be available for a quick call. Since I’ve answered this has been everything that’s happened:

-  She never answered my email back to confirm a time to call, instead she waited until Friday night to tell me she has been having phone trouble and asked if we could talk this weekend. I answered again, telling her I’m not doing anything this weekend so whenever is good for her.  Which I thought the whole thing was odd, because you can use an office phone or something but that’s besides the point. 

-  She never answered that email telling her about my weekend availability until this afternoon. Saying she’s still having phone trouble. And then she goes on to say someone booked the room over our appointment, so she has to cancel then and asked if there’s another day we could do.

 One thing I haven't been able to solve, however, is my getting frustrated when I play board games or video games and getting really frustrated (the kind of anger that makes it hard to focus on something else until you cool off, though not with violence such as hitting people or furniture) when I start to lose, whether it's due to bad luck, bad plays on my part, etc. The most baffling thing about this is that I don't have a similar reaction to bad situations in real life, and that at an intellectual level I know it's silly and pointless and it shouldn't happen. I have tried taking it easy, reminding myself it's only a game, etc., but with little results to show for it.

&amp;#x200B;

 Any ideas on why this might happen? Or ways to start solving it?

I spend a lot of time daydreaming. Basically any time I'm alone I will randomly feel like it. Then I can spend minutes to hours at a time just thinking about my imaginary world. What I dream about resembles some sort of incoherent story. It follows one guy (a character from a story I started long ago) in a birth to death sort of fashion but sometimes there are ""alternative versions"" of how one particular part plays out. I make up and replay certain scenes in my head over and over again. I get annoyed when I'm interrupted or when I can't daydream when I want to. Is this normal?",14Oct2018,1
61,"Hey, I just really wanted to vent somewhere without judgement. 6 years ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1( after a couple suicide attempts ) and I was put on various medications until they found a cocktail that worked for me. I eventually found my groove again and life went back to normal. 2 years ago I found a man who I loved more than anything and he loved me. His mother  is bipolar as well so he was always so understanding but, I guess it became too much for him as he left me one day over text. I've been struggling to get over this. I've been finding myself just sobbing uncontrollably and then some days I'm totally fine. I've been off medication for a year which clearly was a bad idea. I have to wait three months before I can see someone and hopefully start medication again.

62,"I read a very depressing story about a 17-year old woman who committed suicide after months of self-loathing and journal entries. The entires included:

&gt; I’m so lost, I’m so hopeless, I’m so worthless

And a lot of suicidal ideation. I’ve encountered severely depressed people before, and I’ve been mildly depressed before, and I’m not berating her in any way, but how did she have the energy to act happy and put on a ‘mask’? Her parents and friends said she seemed very full of life and energetic.

 A friend of mine who has severe chronic depression (who calls himself optimistic thankfully), I’ll notice him sleep for around sometimes 12 hours, and he won’t have energy to do anything. 

I’ve suffered from mild depression with a lack of energy and feeling tired, sleeping a lot, and I remember looking into my eyes in the mirror and I described it as looking into a black hole, so I became anxious and walked away. I think that describes how I felt pretty well.

This woman, Alex, nearing her suicide I noticed the context of the entries and self-loathing were a bit different. Instead of:

&gt; I’m so worthless...

The context changed to:

&gt; Stop romanticizing suicide. It’s not going to get you anywhere. You don’t have the willpower or the ambition. You are simply a solid waste of space that will never do anything about yourself to fix your problem.

I noticed the ‘you’ message. The way I analyzed this, unfortunately it was almost like a sadistic person wrote those things in the journal and handed it to her, laughing at her anguish. What I’m trying to say is, the ‘you’ message seems very different than the ‘I’ message.

Before she committed suicide, it was sad note that she apologized in the journal and carried it out. I really wish when she was apologizing she would have told someone or called emergency services.

65,"I am in my 30’s and am currently doing an okay job functioning in society as I’ve done an outstanding job of denying and hiding my problems from myself and everyone I’ve had contact with for in the last 15 years.

One of the ways that was accomplished was by completely isolating myself and cutting almost all connections that existed.

Now I find myself in a committed relationship (soon to be married) with a decent job, and it’s only now that I’ve considered actually acknowledging my problems and potentially seeking help, but in doing so there would be no hiding it from my family, my fiancé or her family — and this is what I’m struggling with.

I suffer from extreme anxiety, emotional instability, and a bit of paranoia on a daily basis. In doing research about different mental health issues I realize now that I have had 2 major episodes of psychosis — perhaps even one prolonged episode. One involved serious auditory and visual hallucinations involving seeing the structure of the universe and many, many other strange encounters lasting weeks — the other involved delusions of grandeur in which I convinced myself I was the devil and led to my first and only suicide attempt in order to save humanity (I’ve never told anyone about the true reason I committed the act due to fear of damaging diagnoses).

I’ve never been diagnosed with anything other than major depressive disorder, and I know that it’s only because I was adamant about not telling the truth while I was in the hospital after the attempt.

But now, as I am becoming older and less dependent on others, I would like to seek treatment for debilitating issues that I deal with on a daily basis in hopes of combating the constant paranoia, depression, anxiety, etc.

However in doing so, I would have to expose all of these issues and I simply don’t know the right way to say, “Hey babe, I think I may be schizophrenic” (or what have you).

Has anyone else overcome this fear or does anyone have advice on how to go about revealing something so personal?",14Oct2018,1
66,"I need some advice and maybe thoughts on your opinion. I understand many will say move on and I am still moving forward and I know that I can't personally help this person but I can be there for her. 

I met a girl online dating. Everything was going great. During the time she shared with me that she was on antidepressants and she suffered from depression.. I thought no big deal. We hit it off great. We spent all of July together everyday! The sex and communication was great. During this time I got to know her. She has been taken advantage by a lot of men. She has been cheated on, been used for her money, and has been left by someone she begged to stay. He ended up leaving. It seems like her family support and friend support isn't great and I got to meet her best friend. I also found out she has been almost 4 years sober from alcohol. She has been a former alcoholic. She has been hospitalized because of alcohol. She has also tried to commit suicide as well. I have also noticed scars on her body when she used to cut herself. I feel like over a no period of time she hasn't been able to hold a job, but that wouldn't matter since her family runs an extremely successful company and doesn't ever have to work. Recently has she completed her law degree, and now is back to school to become a Paramedic. Multiple car accidents and DUIs are holding her back from getting into the program. She told me she is suffering from PTSD from the accidents. 

We have gone out multiple times and we had a few bad incidents. A few time she's got extremely emotional and started hitting my dashboard and punching my car window. She would say horrible mean things and would later tell me she didn't mean them it's because she was hurting. This had happened twice. She has also broken all of her plates at home because she was upset. Everytime I was able to calm her down and talk to her. I wasn't thinking anything much or all of this yet. She had an incident where she was punching herself in the face pretty hard. I again was able to calm her down. Recently she enrolled into a medical program and she had to stop smoking weed and was told she couldn't be on her antidepressants. She was freaking out and I didn't think anything big of it since I haven't put together all the signs. After the first day, she went MIA for a few days. She wouldn't reply to texts and finally asked if I could come over...she the replied back and said no! She finally reached out a few days later and she just hugged me and held onto me for about 5 minutes just sobbing. Again, I didn't know what was happening and I just held her. During this time she started getting more agressive and started saying mean things and starting little pretty arguments. We were doing well and almost one morning a month ago I messaged her good morning that I love her. She said the same back. I told her that ""I'm excited for the new Kanye album dropping and I hope she's excited about it as much as I am"" and sent a funny Kanye face. I wanted to share with her that I was looking forward to the new album and I know it's something dumb, but I wanted to share with her something I was excited about. She turned it into an argument. I apologized and the argument persisted. She said more mean things. I told her that I couldn't do the relationship anymore. This isn't the first time I said that but previously and at this time I didn't know what I was fully dealing with. She ended up texting me that night and we were on the same page. We talked it out. The next morning we said good morning to each other and I asked her how the dogs vet appointment went. She replied and I had a follow up question...no response....I waited a few hours and no response. I found that strange because it's not like her. I texted her a funny meme and no response....all day 12 hours. I finally sent her a text stating ""I don't know what I did to be ignored. I am sure you could've made 30 Seconds out of your day to respond. The more you ignore me the more I'm going to get used to it"". She responded. ""I don't want to be in a relationship with you and I'm tired of nthe bickering"". I told her i didn't understand, but I respect her decision and that I was in the relationship to make it work. I never heard from her again.


I find it strange that she was lovey dovey one minute and then went MIA the next.

I did some research and now I understand the severity of mental health. She has been seeing s therapist once a week I feel like she is suffering from severe depression and PTSD but a lot more than I thought. I know she has an extreme sweet tooth, eats high carbs, and sweats so much at night where she is soaked. 

She has been running long distances on a run team and it seems like her friends she runs with keep her an arms distance away as well. 

I haven't heard from be her in a month. I've called and left positive messages. I've texted her multiple times with no responses. All texts have been positive and letting her know that that she is smart, beautiful, and that she's an important part in my life. I have told her if I'm bothering her to let me know.... No responses. After doing research I felt like I met her in her manic stage.. I saw her running last weekend so I'm glad she's doing that but it seemed like she wasn't doing as well as she should have. Is it normal for people not to respond when going off antidepressants? I understand that there's no clear answer, but do people usually contact back? I'm moving on with life, but I've noticed she isn't really online either I'm just concerned and I feel it's not like her to not respond.

69,"Hello folks, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am feeling like I could use some advice in the anxiety department. Let me give you some background info:

1) I have had anxiety issues since I was in high school. I am now 28 and working on my PhD and teaching at a university. Most of the time I can manage my anxiety, but lately it has really been affecting me negatively. In addition to being pretty stressed about some upcoming exams and workload, I have had some major life events recently (they are positive life events!) that added lots of stress at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

2) When things get rough, I typically go on an antidepressant. It usually works out well for me. This time around, I am using the same antidepressant I have used in the past but it is not doing the trick...like at all. I have been on it for a few months so I feel like it should have kicked in by now. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) It is affecting my teaching ability and I feel physically sick a lot. Like, flu-type symptoms. These symptoms were present before I started the antidepressant. I assumed they were related to anxiety, but just in case I did get some blood work done, and everything check out. Now, I am stuck with anxiety and am consistently getting sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anything have any advice? What has worked well for you? Any self-help books? Any recommendations on types of therapies? Anyone have any advice on how to maintain healthy stress/anxiety levels while teaching or speaking to your boss?

Thanks in advance :)  ",14Oct2018,1
70,"Trying to figure this all out.  So I'm just going to list my symptoms.  Maybe it will be good to get them off of my chest.  Thanks for listening in advance.

~Memory loss: sometimes intermittent, sometimes not.  Sometimes I will remember events in the past, then will forget them later on.  I have had episodic memory loss where I forget past events.  This can occur shortly after the event, or long after it.  I sometimes forget days or even longer.  I might remember some absurd detail from my past, but I might forget what I did the past week.

~Disassociation: sometimes I feel like I am living in a dream.  This happens during the event, or after it.  For example, in the moment I might not be quite sure if what is going on is real or not, or I might be recalling an event and it might seem to me like a vivid dream...like where I am not sure if it is a memory or just a lifelike dream.

~Depression: I'm just fucking down right now.  This comes and goes.  There is always an undercurrent of depression, but there is always a degree.  I can remember a couple of periods of extreme depression, but I can only remember the feeling, not the actual memories, which leads me to believe that depression and anxiety have some effect on memory, anxiety in particular.

~Repetitive movements/talking: this is what really worries me.  I've caught myself repeating words over and over.  I think it's always occurred when I am alone but I am not 100% sure.  I just caught myself in the shower...I don't even remember what I was saying, or for how long I was saying it.  Something maybe about 'stop', but I'm not sure.  I think I make small repetitive movements when I zone out...drumming or tapping or shaking my hand. 

I think that's it for now, but I'll probably recall something more later.  I just wanted to get it out there.  It's helped me just putting it all down.  Thanks for listening.  Tell me what you think and if you feel the same way. ",14Oct2018,1

She’s very closed with her emotions and will never say if anything is wrong as she doesn’t think she is worth worrying about. The only time she will talk about things is if she’s quite drunk. 

She cuts her self and has told me while drunk that she does so to feel something instead of feeling empty inside. Also while drunk she told me she felt like she had no reason to be alive and couldn’t see living past 18. As well as this she told me she wants to talk to me about this stuff but there’s like a wall stopping her and she worries that I’ll think she’s crazy or not worth the time. 

I am worried for her as I know she has thought about ways to kill her self and tried to see if they would work as a way out if she needs it. I want to help her with how she feels but I know I can’t push her to talk about it if she doesn’t want too.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to share some information about myself regarding certain events that transpired over the past few years.

I am just going to jump straight in to it and say that I was involved in a highly classified mission during which I was degraded, tortured, raped, and left for dead.

I still live in a hostile enviroment where the tortures can come back and hurt me at any second, I have no safety or protection from the powers that hurt me. They keep me alive to mock me when I experience my trauma's, laugh at me, humiliate me, degrade me, and push me to punish myself in order to satisfy their needs.

&amp;#x200B;

During my episodes they interject and make sure it severely worse than it should be.

They shout in my face and yell profanities to my person during my episodes.

They shit on me, they pee'd on me, they came in me. I agree'd to none of those things.

They cut my body and then try to dissociate me from the pain I felt on my body and claim it's not my wounds while I could clearly feel them there.

They sometimes pretend to be nice people in order to get me set up to have another trauma where i injure myself.

they degrade my thoughts and my feelings and tell me I am not allowed to feel or experience emotions or thoughts for myself.

**Should you cut an unbearably negative relative out of your life, if you know their damaged and ultimately sad on the inside?** What if you see that they can't take pleasure in anything, but keep emotionally battering you, along with the things you love and people around you? How can you help some one who never enjoys themselves, and how can you stop them hurting you? **How can you reverse a life time of habitual negativity in someone else**? 

Context; My aunt has always come across as a bitter, snappy, negative and cantankerous person. She can also be sweet under the layer of biting, snide comments, and she's very accommodating and love playing the host, But she's also relentlessly critical and negative about almost everything, and is regularly acidic, cruel and nasty (not to mention ignorant, racist and non-feminist but we can clock that down to generation - she's going to be 70 next year)

Right now she's staying with my mum, while she's visiting from Italy; Mum feels constantly belittled, criticized and out-right insulted, not to mention exhausted trying to point out the positives/look on the bright side. My mum has put up with this kind of criticism and abuse her whole life, but has been saying recently that her tolerance and ability ""laugh it off"" has diminished and she can't stand it. It's become unbearable and my mum doesn't know what to do - cutting all ties doesn't seem like an option, because it's my aunt, and under neath the hurtfulness, is also a tragic lonely person. 

I don't know how to handle this either or what can be suggested. We've all told her at some point, in the moment  just how hurtful the things she's saying is, or how ungrateful, entitled or plain rude she's being... but she just becomes defensive as if we're the rude ones. 

She's always been like this. She has very few friends of her own, no hobbies, nothing to relax her, and by her own admission ""can't relax"" and doesn't get pleasure from anything. She burns a lot of bridges, holds grudges, and even my mum's friends can see how almost ridiculously funny outrageously rude she is. 

However, all of this, according to my mum, has stemmed from her being a victim of a very harsh upbringing and a suffocating misogynistic macho orientated marriage. And if we were to choose never to see her again, she would be crushed. 

What is best for my family?

Her family has went through a LOT of problems, they even went to family counsiling or however it's called. Even after that her parents punish her very severely for small stuff, for example today she wasn't allowed to eat because dhe refused to take the dog out (dog that is very agressive towards her)

She deals with severe depression (already tried to commit suicide once or twice), eating problems, self-hate and severe sleep troubles. She goes to a therapist twice a week, she often refuses to eat because she wants to be ""skinny and pretty"". I don't know how to prevent that, i have told her so many times that she's perfect as she is (she's completely normal, not overweight at all). I have gotten so mad so many times over the way her family treats her. Her dad lives by a rule which is basically ""you have no rights in this house"", even though she never told me about it, i'm pretty sure her dad beat her, what happened today hit me so  bad, i don't know what else i can do since we live at about 2000km away from eachother.

77,"Lately I find myself in a predicament. How do I enjoy life? The problem I have isn't depression at this point, though it used to be and for the most part I have managed to work through that, took years but I'm doing well. I have accepted I will probably be on a pension for life, I have accepted that I will always come off as a little odd, I might miss a social cue here or there. I'm fine in a lot of ways so I don't mean to rant that I'm not. Financially stable, own place, awesome cat, internet, but though I have no reason to be depressed I'm not happy. 

I have really bad anxiety which leads to paranoid psychosis. I have mess that help mask the symptoms well, but not to the point where I can answer my door or say take my bin out at night if the sun goes down. But enough to not have to turn off every light but the strategically acceptable ones, listening to a range of menacing tones and half words carried on the wind. The problem though is if I take it too many days consecutively I can't focus on my games, I can't talk to my friends on discord and in a way I'm completely grateful for that's all I really have.

So I miss a dose or two and bam I'm right where I am right now waiting for first light, which is right now actually, for the relative safety of the sun. I spent all night shifting furniture in front of entrances and listening at windows for the inevitable invaders I have concocted in my mind. I know rationally that it probably wouldn't happen, but rationality seldom trumps a runaway mind. So today I have to medicate, it will be fine for a day or two until inevitably I am pacing back and forth unable to get involved in any activity I enjoy. Till that becomes unbearable so I chose the whispers... till that becomes unbearable. This is the best medication I've found but I'm left wondering how do I enjoy all the blessings I have when I am faced with as I see it, the ultimate catch 22

I isolate myself and although people consider me normal, I feel really bad and hopeless. I feel like everybody else does better than me and my emotions are just f***** up all the time. I don't know what to do anymore. I go from being calm one day to crying a lot the next one, I feel like a roller coaster. I will not go to a psychiatrist, I did it in the past and it did not help. Only death would help me but my family would be terribly sad and also my friends and colleagues. So I am stuck. Just venting but my life is sad and pointless. I have false hopes of turning it all around but god hates me. God hates me so much he punished me with a horrible existence and I just want to die but he won't kill me. I pray everyday for god to kill me but he does not do it!",14Oct2018,1
79,"Our social self loves bathing in the eyes of strangers and even more so in the eyes of our social bubble. I am a very awkward person and thus I always stood aside. Parties as a teen were horrible, parties at the University were a nightmare and I developed a nice, deeply rooted depression. 

But then, I discovered a person I had not met in years if ever, myself. Loneliness is only a word, a figure made of letters, but for me, it is a friend, the only friend. When I was 17 I went to London alone; on my journey, we are in the year 1987 AD., I felt so free and confident that it was almost eerie. Arriving at my hotel in Earls Court and entering my solitary room, my heart sung. This was how I wanted it to be, how it should be.

Today, at 48 and a grandfather to two adorable girls, I still am a loner, but my mental health never deteriorated again and I feel that my self-chosen confinement was and is the key to my well-being. Enjoying the time with my girls is key to my happiness, but seeking the comfort of my own thoughts and the discussion with nature is my key to survival.

I share this with you, my friend, maybe you are a loner too and should stop seeking accolade and advice from others. Feel free to go to the woods and talk to the sun-beams and the crickets, dance with the butterflies, run about the deeer butt-naked and enjoy your own company. Maybe, just maybe, you will have a good friend in yourself?

Love and hugs to you, friend, I am out there dancing, alone, maybe you can too.

82,"So, I've experienced anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember which isn't all that long. (I'm also potentially on the autism spectrum but it's complicated). I'm 24, and have only a few vivid childhood memories that I think are mostly due to having photographs available. I can remember blips here and there but can't imagine myself being present for anything prior to the age of 14 or so. 

I'm not sure, but I'm starting to believe that *something* happened that I've blocked out. There's a little more context in my recent post on r/advice but I'm not sure it's all that useful.

Not sure where to go from here? Resources / thoughts? I'm not desperate to recover most of those lost memories but I'd like to know where they went. ",14Oct2018,1

84,"Hello
At the age of 12, I suffered a severe injury which left me, for a short while, ultra dependent on my mother. That, coupled with the breakdown of my parents' marriage caused me to start developing severe separation anxiety where my mother is concerned. 
I'd have to accompany her everywhere, go downstairs intermittently to 'check she is still alive' and call up her workplace and friends regularly. After a while, I began to develop tendencies whereby I would have to effectively 'commentate' my life, as if my mother could hear me. To explain how extreme this went, I would for example have to say ""I'm now walking into the bathroom"" under my breath or ""I've just seen someone who looks like grandma"". It got very very severe, but I - regrettably - never spoke to anyone about it. It eventually phased out after a few years, but it was a deeply traumatising thing to live through, as it was so constant and draining, as I was always describing and commentating every minuscule thing in the world around me. I began to appear distant and slow, because I'd have to mutter my commentaries before I could reply to someone in real life. Deep down, I knew she couldn't hear me but then if I tried to stop, I felt like I was betraying her. 
I'm just wondering if anyone could shed any light on what I went through? I just feel I owe it to my former self. I tried hard to help myself but I couldn't find anyone who had been through something similar. I guess it was probably a heightened form of separation anxiety + OCD, but I'd love to know, as I feel that I have to do myself justice as my teenage years were so badly hindered by this. Thank you! I'm not necessarily asking for a retrospective diagnosis, but If there is anyone who might be able to give some opinions, or just anything, it would be amazing. It's just indescribably awesome to finally open up about this, something which I haven't done in person. ",14Oct2018,1
85,"I start stressing about everything, how my life isn’t the way I want, how I don’t like the way I look, how I need more money, how I need to do this or that.

86,"My parents argued a lot when I was younger (before they broke up). One of my earliest memories was them shouting at each other while I tried to make them stop. I dont know if this is helpful at all.

87,"
Sorry for the long post, but I've got multiple problems to solve and no idea where to start.

1) Schizoid Personality Disorder is by far my biggest problem I guess. I've lost/ I don't have access to most of my emotions.
I'm capable of small amounts of joy and sadness, but that's it. I'm so numb and it feels like an endless void.
How do I gain/ regain them?

2) No sense of achievement/ success is another problem.
Some background on me: I'm 21 years old and raised by narcissistic parents (both are narcissists). They discovered I was quite intelligent and from there on (I was ~3 years old) treated me as an object to brag with rather than a child. Now that I moved out and the fear of punishment is no longer a factor I have neither motivation nor ideas nor interests on what to do with my life. I sometimes have the energy to tinker with some code and do some stuff, but I rarely finish it and if I do I don't get any sense of accomplishment or pride or Joy from it. Absolutely nothing. 
How do I work around that?
Where do I start? Also, this is strongly connected to problem 1), so I'm even more confused on where to start.

3) Severe depression. Thankfully, I was never suicidal. But I was in a psychosomatic ward for 7 weeks this summer. I don't even have the energy to eat some days, and I have no respect/ love for myself to change that. I was taught all my life that I'm worthless and my only worth is my achievements (from which I don't have anything, because even if I achieve something, I don't feel good).

Basically I have no emotions, no ambitions or dreams and no energy to change that. Where do I start?
I am in therapy, but it was unsuccessful so far.
I'd like to hear more thoughts, ideas or advice from more sources. I consider myself pretty good at solving problems, but somehow that doesn't apply to my own.
I'd appreciate any sort of input to improve my situation, or at least onmhow I should deal with it and make the best of it with what I have.",14Oct2018,1
88,"I was at a really low point last year, I had to cry in the bathroom every day during 3rd hour, me and the teacher developed our own fucking sign language to indicate that I'm a depressed ass bitch. Anyway, my reputation crumbled as I began to lie about myself to seem cooler because I was also extremely self conscious (still am). This year though, I tried acting more proper and less mentally ill. When I told people that I was better they started telling me what a shithead I was last year, and that made me kinda sad. One of the people that told me I was shit was a girl, I'll call her R, who I thought was my friend and had an inferiority complex about last year. She hates me now, even though I've tried to fix my mistakes, I haven't done shit to her. She treats me like garbage and it makes me upset because I see her as a good person. I'm trying to improve myself, but people are so cruel to the point where I don't know if it's worth it anymore. I mean, fuck, they hate me, I hate me, what the fuck is the point? I'm a trash garbage person apparently and everyone is better than me. All I need is for something major to happen and I'll have an actual excuse to completely breakdown.

89,"TL;DR. My (ex)friend [F26] with diagnosed mental issues (BPD) came up to visit me unannounced for the first time in several years 5 days ago, and shows no sign of leaving anytime soon. Due to her attachment issues I'm [M28] struggling to find a way to politely ask her when she is leaving without setting her off, any advice is appreciated.

Full:

I [M28] have known $friend for approximately 10 years, we were very close for 3 years, (16-19) drinking, out all the time, acting like immature teens the usual, next 2 years (19-21) we were still good friends, but saw each other less frequently due to each having our own relationships and lifestyle choices, then 5 years ago I moved 400+ miles away and dropped contact with all negative influences in my life (Basically 90% of the people I knew at that point).

Over the past 5 years $friend has been diagnosed with BPD, been repetedly sectioned by the police, lost her driving license for drink driving, made several attempts on her own life (resulting in more mandatory time in care), and generally spiralled completely out of control.

Recently $friend added me on Facebook, acting like no time had passed at all (3 years since we last spoke), and announcing she was coming to visit, the next day she was at my home where she has been for the last 5 days now. The problem is rather than reconnecting as adults, she has latched on to me like a child, her behaviour is as bad if not worse than when we were teens, a drunken crying mess when we went out, and horribly slovenly at home (both my car and every room she inhabits have become a tip, and she didn't even get dressed for the last 2 days).

I want to tell her nicely this isn't acceptable or even just get a time frame for how long she intends to be here, but all attempts at serious communication seem to end in her crying and talking about how much she's missed me, how crap her life has been going etc, but she's brought the same destructive lifestyle with her and as horrible as it sounds I'm tired of it and don't want it adversely affecting my life or work.

I'd appreciate any advice as quite frankly I'm completely out of my depth here, and at this rate she'll still be here in her onesie at Christmas.",14Oct2018,1
90,"So my friends all think that I’m weird because I like pain. It’s not all pain, it’s just stinging pain that I like. They all said that they don’t like it and that I’m really weird. Am I all that weird though?",14Oct2018,1
91,"I’m sure there are people here who have tried therapy. I have a very close friend of mine who has not been doing well mentally for awhile and I suggested therapy a month or so ago. She seemed receptive and to like the idea yet she still hasn't tried to get a therapist. There’s a lot of things going on in her mind subconsciously that she doesn’t understand and its hurting her a lot and it fucking kills me that she’s trying to internalize all of it. She doesn’t have very many people she’s in her life that she’s comfortable enough to open herself up to. I’m one of the three and we’re on weird terms right now so it’s hard for me to be there for her. I’ve dealt with depression my whole life, but am lucky enough to have a strong support group in which I can externalize how I feel and haven’t tried therapy myself, although I feel I’d benefit a lot from it.

Does anybody have any input on therapy? Positive or negative experiences? Ways to convince her it’s a worthwhile step to take to get on the road to recovery? Am I wrong for trying to persuade her that it’s a good idea? I just care about this person VERY Fucking deeply and her current state of mind breaks my heart because she’s such a wonderful human.

TW: Anxiety, OCD mentions, intrusive thoughts &amp; abuse mentions

I ‘recently‘ (several months ago) got out of a very bad environment with a partner who abused me in every single way, went back to my parents house after leaving in my teens due to abuse there.
I dragged myself out of there as fast as I could by applying for college and ultimately moving away again after months of gaslighting. I don‘t want to go into too much detail, but my mother belongs on the r/raisedbynarcissists staple of bad people who don‘t deserve to be forgiven. She used to beat me, lock me up and when she noticed I grew distant brought my father into it at every give chance, so she would be the one I‘d run to, after she told him to beat me or break my things. This went on until I moved out in my late teens. It used to be the worst when I got a bad grade or embarrassed my mom by saying the wrong thing or stuttering. 
I started college and had very limited options after being out of education for several years and having big empty spaces in my CV of when I was forced into sex work. 
I did my best so far regardless, always completing more than I was asked for, taking notes, being voted student rep, taking turns first in every presentation so no one else has to do it, hand around my notes and fix problems for lecturers in IT, classmates in interpersonal, organizing college things and parties, meets and helping people who are joining late, cook with my friends who live in dorms, and even though I hide and joke about it, my fears have been getting worse. 
I play over it during the day and it got quite ok in public, but I‘m still a germaphobe. It‘s less a fear of the getting sick, missing something spiral but more of the I am so dirty and disgusting and I‘d better not make anyone uncomfortable. Which, being a twink ass trans man isn‘t easy. I never really fitted into anywhere growing up and I just kind of got used to being the laughing stock in school, but I‘m the oldest one in my class now and I am worried that I‘m just their rep for using me or that people laugh about me behind my back.
On top of that I‘m out some days washing my hands several times, avoiding college computers while doing media studies, wearing cotton gloves whenever my classmates aren‘t around. 
I do get the great FREE therapy offered by the gov, but I don‘t feel like they want to put in any effort, let alone cracking me open. I asked several times to talk more, to get more questions, but all I hear is that they don‘t want to dig deeper and make me feel worse. 
So I keep going on, using other peoples pens, laughing it all off, not wiping down every key separately and putting my bag on the floor. 
And no reward. 
I don‘t feel better. I still spiral through the inevitable You shouldn‘t have survived! thoughts when I make a mistake or stutter in class. I have to shut myself out of group work by dissociating into my notes, because I can‘t handle 20 or so people blindly stumbling for solutions to problems nobody tells us about. 
I don‘t get the praise, I don‘t get better grades for going on 200% constantly and I live in constant fear of my parents cutting me off for good for slowly transitioning, being told to kms by my mother when I hinted at it a while back. 
Still being misgendered, still having people see me as The Female I don‘t feel like I belong either. 
I started working out, cutting out dairy and gluten, I started lifting weights again, meeting new people bit I‘m so afraid that my workload will become less and I don‘t even want to think about holidays approaching. 
My friends in science fields (same age and older) all have achieved so many things, know so much and sometimes tease me for going into arts which - to be blatantly honest - designing things will likely not feed me and I am wasting another year of my life just dreaming up working at a cozy little office which will never happen. 
I still have the option of switching majors at the end of the year, starting over eventually, but I have never been allowed to make my own choices and given my mother always wanted me to study design having ended up here feels like I still am not able to think for myself. 
I honestly don‘t know if I belong in a science field, nor if I will be able to afford it, with my father retiring soon and having limited options as a student to work or take out a loan in a country where I‘m on a visa. 
I keep going on, and it feels stupid having survived cancer, abusive and an attempt on my life, having to rot away on a waiting list for transitioning (15 more months to go until I even get to see someone at that clinic, wohoo!), and knowing I will never really belong anywhere because I never got to become a real person as a kid and that door is now shut. 
I‘m writing this after my third shower today, I got a job interview tomorrow for a minimum wage part-time job for a company that designs sports clothing. I doubt I stand a chance at 5‘7“ 94lbs. 
But then again the past years of working the worst job, being on the wrong anxiety medication that got me addicted (legally, but still damaging), and coming out of everything with nothing in the end are barely a status quo. ",14Oct2018,1
94,"((if this goes against sub rules pls lmk! i didnt see anything against this type of post)) 
im gonna call her Q, we’ve been extremely close since the 7th grade, shes my best friend. i feel so incredibly guilty for being suspicious. 

in the past ive played up my own mental illnesses, and have been around a lot of people who do the same. and a lot of people who genuinely have said disorders. a difference ive noticed between those w the disorders, and fakers, is that the fakers talk about it a lot, and describe the symptoms instead of letting them genuinely show. ((im not a psychologist! this is just what started my suspicion)). 

Q claims to have multiple personalities. yet, they only “show” when she smokes weed? and when she has personality switches, they all act the exact same as she does. During the switches she’ll describe that alter’s personality but yet that “personality” still acts the same as her. 

Something that happened recently, me and Q chilled. we smoked marijuana and she suddenly started making out with me. “Fuck this is so stupid, my boyfriends going to kill me.” 
then as if like clockwork, she had a “switch” at that moment. telling me its okay if we go further, bc shes having a switch and thats not really her. 


i love her, shes my blood, but i cant help being weighed down by suspicion. maybe im just ignorant of how multiple personalities work. but isnt the point of multiple personalities, is that theyre not all exactly alike. all the same have the same ideals, likes, interests, etc? im worried about her. if what shes going through legit, how do i help be supportive?
