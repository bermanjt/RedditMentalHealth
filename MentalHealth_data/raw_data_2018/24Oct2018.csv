0,"There will be a TL;DR at the end. I apologize if this isn't the proper subreddit to post to, but I don't know where else to turn.  


This is long, so I do apologize in advance.  


Some context for all: I currently live with both of my parents due to a personal financial situation, and I also live in Texas. My mother, the reason for me making this post, is an incredibly mentally ill woman. For all intents and purposes, she is a recluse. For the record, she is diagnosed with manic depression, manic anxiety, bipolar disorder, and has auditory hallucinations caused by schizophrenia. When she is off her meds, she thinks that my father is trying to poison her. She also will just brush me off when I try and talk to her about why she's doing stuff, or just lie to me in my face. And she will only eat food/buy groceries from certain places because ""everywhere else your dad has poisoned"". About 15 years ago, she was committed(I think that's the proper term) into a state run mental facility for about 3 months. Afterwards, she was doing very well for quite a number of years. On multiple occasions we've had to call the cops on her because she's had some \*really\* nasty and pretty violent psychotic episodes. I won't go into details, but let's just say the last one caused eight LEO's specialized in dealing with mentally ill folks to show up. Also my mother's family are all toxic, manipulative, pieces of garbage that have been causing my family drama and bullshit for more than 27+ years. Worth mentioning, she is not above suicide, and has been stopped from ending it once before. Even though it might sound like it, but I do not blame my mom for acting the way she does. I blame the illness itself. That said, I firmly believe that I haven't seen my real mom in about a decade and a few years due to her illness.  


A few months ago, my very mentally ill mother had another psychotic episode that resulted in numerous cops being called. The long and short of that bit is that she was peacefully taken in, was given an evaluation, and then spent about a week and a half at a mental facility. This is not the first time that this has happened. During her stay, she told my father, myself, and my brother that she realized she messed up and wanted to get better. Seeking therapy/counseling, finding a job, becoming more independent, stuff to that effect. Things looked like they were on the up and up. After her stay, she immediately stopped taking her meds and stopped seeking therapy because, as she puts it, ""I'm better without the meds and they lie to me"". Over the course of the past few months, all the while being off her meds, she's been slipping more and more and more into her psychosis.   


By slipping more and more into her psychosis, I mean that she does not leave her room, that she keeps locked, while my dad is in the house. She has brought SO MUCH SHIT down from the attic into her room. She has flushed all of her meds down the toilet. She will not eat certain food items if the label is the wrong color. The house itself stinks of this weird dull odor that emanates from her room. She has gone so far as to throw away any charger my dad uses for his stuff, threw out his pipe and bud, and would tamper with his shampoo and body wash. Very recently, she has decided to confiscate the smoke detector in the house because ""You put something in this"". When my dad questioned with ""What do you think I put in there?"" she gave no reply other than sending daggers through her eyes at him while ignoring me. I almost forgot to mention that she also confiscated my dad's .45 pistol. But, we don't keep ammo in the house for a reason. A lot of this happens when neither myself or my dad are in the house. I feel like she is on the cusp of becoming a hoarder.  


At the advice of my therapist and an officer that was there for the last two psychotic episodes, we called up the city attorney to see what could be done. At this point, this was about a month and a half after her last episode and was and currently is off her meds. Unfortunately, the city attorney claims that unless she herself is a danger to herself or those around her; there is nothing that could be done.  


She is getting progressively worse and worse as the days go by since she is not on her meds which is causing a great emotional toll on my dad and I and we simply don't know wtf to do. What we would like to see happen is that she gets the help that she needs and sticks with it. We do not care how this happens. About 15 years ago, she was committed(I think that's the proper term) into a state run mental facility for about 3 months. Afterwards, she was doing very well; and it seemed like my mom was back for the first time in what seemed like forever. That's the ideal. The question I pose to you Reddit is this: wtf can my dad or myself do to get my mom the help she needs before she has another episode? At this point, the only potential solutions are for my dad to goad my mother into having another episode, or I call the police to do a wellness check on her. Both of which are bad for a number of reasons. However, my dad, brother, and myself all agree that she needs to be in a mental facility for a minimum of 3 months. The problem is that she will not go willingly.  


TL;DR My mother is fucking crazy and off her meds. She ignores me and thinks my dad is trying to poison her. How can either of us get her the helps she needs?",24Oct2018,1

2,"Yesterday I was kicked in the throat, while I was sitting on a subway car, during rush hour.

I am partially to blame.  

There was this guy, gold chain, missing teeth, walking along the platform motioning like he would hit or stab people as he made his way / intimidated his way through the crowd.

I don’t know why but I followed him.  I kept thinking this guy was probably high and having a really bad day, or a real asshole.

It reminded me of a friend I lost to drugs and it bothered me to see someone acting this way, so I followed him along the platform and sat across from him in the train.  Then I went next level crazy and just stared at him.

We were together in transit for about two minutes and he started swearing and kicking me in the legs and spitting and eventually got up and kicked me in the neck.  I just stared at him the whole time not saying anything or reacting.

Afterwards I started to raise my fists and then changed my mind and still just staring at him pressed the security strip in the train.

People got out of the way, but nobody said anything or asked if I was okay.  We both left the train at the next stop.  I told him he just kicked a stranger in the neck and I forgive him.

In retrospect I should have just ignored him and hit the security strip without engaging - the guy also clearly had/was trouble.

Still, would like to understand why I felt the need to follow and stare and engage.  Also very disturbed that this can happen in front of people and they will do nothing. 

I told my wife but said I don’t want to talk about it.  Not sure why I put myself at risk this way.  Haven’t told anyone else.",24Oct2018,1

5,"I am F22 and I am tired most of the time. This has been going on for years but would come in waves. Currently it’s at its worst. During my days off, I will sleep for most of the day and then sleep normally at night as well. I once counted 18 hours of sleep In a day (with breaks). This has been happening more frequently. When I have work or school I can force myself to go and do what I need to do but once I get home I am extremely tired 90% of the time. 
I went to my doctor and they did tests on my blood etc. and found nothing wrong. The doctor recommended anti depressants and therapy but I am not convinced. I don’t mind being depressed, I’ve gotten used to the sadness over the years and have learned to utilize it In my art. Besides, I have many happy moments as well. Although I understand that my tiredness probably has a connection to my depression, I’d rather focus on fixing the tiredness. The way I see it, there is no guarantee that happy pills will give me more energy and focus, but they sure will change other things and I’d rather not commit to a drug I don’t think I need for the rest of my life. 
I cannot keep living my life sleeping, I have plans for the future but I doubt they will come to fruition unless I fix this problem. Sometimes I drink energy drinks which work wonderfully but I’m not a fan of the health hazards attached. Coffee makes me sleepy so that’s out of the question. I’ve tried caffeine pills which work okay but I’ve heard that they will cause damage to the nervous system over long term use. Ive also heard that they are bad for the voice and I am a vocalist. 
Have any of you experienced this and found a magical drug? On one hand I’d do anything to be normal and productive but on the other hand I don’t wan to have a f’ed up body in 20years. If you have any advice please help! 

Tl;Dr: I am tired most of the time, sleep am abnormal amount. Doctors can’t find anything wrong with me but suggest antidepressants. I am skeptical of these and have been self medicating with energy drinks and caffeine pills, but I’m scared of long term effects. Looking for advice. ",24Oct2018,1

7,"Hi everyone,

Recently i've been getting is what I can best describe brain fog, I feel like I'm not as sharp or articulate as i was even just three years ago. 

I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I've had adhd like symptoms since i was a kid ( which is why i got evaluated 3 years ago).

I've all ways had trouble in school, my grades where very poor throughout my academic career until 3 years when I got the help I needed, then my grades skyrocketed. I transferred from community college to a university, my first semester was last term and did well, my processing speed for learning new things is a little lower on the average side but that's never stopped me from learning or succeeding.

But last 6-9 months I feel like ive been getting dumber, I can't focus on reading my text books, I see the words but I just can't seem to get engaged. When I don't get engaged the white back ground in the back gets brighter and then the words just seen insignificant. I feel like my motivation ran out, and the gas tank in my brain is on Empty.

I even got a zero on my first exam for one of my classes because I had a panic attack, I studied hard for the second one and got an 8/25. I did really well on the prerequisite course to this class.

I was just wondering if anyone has gone through this, and how you got over it.

Thanks ! ",24Oct2018,1

10,"I feel as if I'm suddenly at the end of my rope and it's scaring the shit out of me. I've been depressed all my life but just fairly recently have I been dealing with this new issue, and I'm terrified that it might actually drive me to suicide this time. 

It's this constant restless feeling like I need to either get really fucked up (off of weed, liquor, xanax, phenibut, anything) or just knock myself unconscious/go to sleep. It's almost as if my mind is in this constant panic attack like state where it feels like I can't find peace anywhere, with anyone, or doing anything. The only time I can feel 'better' is if I smoke myself until I'm high as shit or abuse my xanax prescription. Sleep, and vivid dreaming specifically, is the only other escape I have as well but I have a love-hate relationship with it at this point because I know I'm going to inevitably wake up and have to go through a vicious hellscape of a day before I can repeat the cycle and enjoy a fleeting moment of escape. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a student in college, with no friends and no success ever with women, and I feel like this might be the end--despite being completely lucid. It's as if my mind is eating self alive as I watch in horror. 

I've got SAD, GAD, persistent depressive disorder + major depressive episodes, Borderline Personality Disorder, and ADHD. I don't want to nor am I capable of killing myself, but I just can't fucking take this anymore, it's driving me to insanity. ",24Oct2018,1
11,"June of this year, I underwent the most hellacious hellstorm for 3 months. It was a series of events that thrust me into burn-out and utter emptiness. 

In this thick storm, I involuntarily created a coping mechanism ... I started writing a book. Not just any fictional book, but a letter from myself to myself in which I (the reader of this fictitious letter) write to my present self. My mind goes odd places due to my specific mental chemistry. (Autism being one aspect.) Anyway, despite my loneliness and isolation and dread and emptiness ... I found myself reading these letters from future self to my present self realizing that I wasn't creating some odd psychological thriller; I was giving myself hope, and I changed my mindset of things in the process.

Now, one of the aspects of this ""letter"" is the aspect of mental health, and how it might be perceived in the future. 

No doubt what we go through is severe, debilitating, crushing, and so many more words I cannot recall... 

But I started to wonder, ""What did mental disorder look like thousands of years ago?"" This question led me into a rabbit hole..

And I came to the conclusion at the end that, mental disorders are only present because there's a very critical, aggressive,  controlling ""system"" in place that requires us functioning in a very very very narrow way. And anyone who prefers to function in another way is seen as someone outside the boundary of what is ""normal"" and ""healthy"". 

Someone whose mind wanders constantly, opting for more personally suitable interests, is seen with a deficit of awareness and attention. 

Someone who wants to go dark and deep existing in a world that pushes them to always act (thus feel) happy may find themselves pointing their dark depth inward, realizing the supposed lack.

Someone who has hyper-sensory-stimulation thrust into an already overwhelmingly stimulatory situation, and that person must act and behave in a certain way while dealing with audible, visual, textile, social, emotional stimulation ... wouldn't they revolt?

What I'm getting at... all of us, we have minds that like to go deep. We hate the surface, all of it. All of those things that other people call a ""good life"" – extrinsic rewards. Yet we feel like shit because we feel we should want them, too? And some of us fully believe we want those shallow rewards because we've been told that lie so many times ...

&amp;#x200B;

This post isn't to make you feel better. We hurt, all of us here. We're in so much pain. But just understand ... your mind has a preference for deep thinking, deep processing, a wandering and meandering pace, unique odd and strange interests, certain mannerisms and behaviors that others might point out... all of if. 

&amp;#x200B;

We all walk through life at different paces, different postures, different walking styles, so to speak. We are different – and this is ultimately okay. We have responsibilities that we don't want to do, and we do them, and we do them over and over, and then we get warn down and want to have no more of these responsibilities. And that is okay! You we can feel this way, we're allowed. We don't need to resist. That resisting wears us down anymore. We must still do them, but we don't have to enjoy doing them – trying to enjoy something like others seems to do will also wear us down. 

You must look at it differently: ""Perhaps my mind, if others knew its capacity hidden behind this beat up and burnt out mask, would envy what great potential it has.""

My sister is pretty much like every other 15 year old loud, mouthy, obnoxious, and arrogant, she takes being a douchy teenager to a whole new level. Her and I use to be close but now everytime she opens her mouth I want to punch her, she never has anything positive to say to me or about me. She LOVES to starts fights with me over the dumbest shit, Like asking for something when I a simple no answer she blows up saying something like ""wow someone is in a bitchy mood today what the fuck if your problem"" then she'll go on and on calling me a dumb bitch and fucker and any other absurd name she can come up with on the spot. Its not so much the names she's calling me its how shes saying and the reason why, she's not getting her way or what she wants so she has to make me feel like shit till I get to the point where I start yelling back witch I know doesn't help and is probably the reaction that she is trying to get out of me but when she starts going off and making digs at me and making me feel like shit about myself I start to make them back like telling her she talks like trash. I always feel really bad after talking to her like that but I just want her to feel the way I'm feeling. The one thing that annoys me the most is when I try to vent about it people just say of well thats what younger siblings are for.... Like uhh nooo I don't know anyone else who's younger sibling treats them the way my sister treats me. She uesing me as her verbal punching bag she really knows where to hit with her words to makes me feel like shit. But my sister acts the way she does and treats me the way she does because of my mother. 

My mother is actually the lest supportive and most selfish mother I know. She much rather see me sink then swim, she's never showed excitement or emotion to in anything I have accomplished. I was able to take college art classes in high school and get a dual credit and I graduated with a certificate in both high school and college and when I told her she didn't really seem to care and when I asked her what she thought about it she straight up told me that she doesn't want to deal with me when I start to get overwhelmed or stressed out. The one thing that made me feel the worst about myself is when she told I would never be a good mother and I would get my kids taking away from me. I have never gave a reason for her to think or say anything like that. I'm a very caring person and ues to baby sit kids all the time in my teen years. but she loves to throw that dig at me any chance she can. For her to think so low of me like that really hurts. I have really low of self-esteem and 95% of the reason I feel so shitty about myself is becuase of her and of the lack support I've got from her. Last year I was just kind of going through a rough time financially and had no way to get to work because I don't have a car and didn't have enough money to get a cab to work and back all the time and would ask her for a ride and she would make the bigest deal about it like I'm such an inconvenience in her life and how dare I ask her for help and when I call her out for not helping me she says I'm 22 and ahe doesn't have to do anything for me and I should figure it out myself, then I'd tell her normally parents would help out thier kids when they need help, and she says well I'm not a normal parents I don't have to do shit for you. I have so much hate towards her, I'm not sure if I'd go as fat as saying I hate her because at the end of the day shes my mom and shes the one that gave me life, but shes just the worst person to be around, or try to talk to when something is wrong, I never felt like I was able to talk to her about anything that was going so when it comes to expressing my feelings is extremely hard for me I'm just so use to bottling them up that when it comes time to talking about my feelings it just freeze up or I hold them in untill I can't handle it any more and have an emotional out burst of the smallest shit. I go through life with alot of anxiety because of her. when I'm around her or my sister for to long I feel very anxious, and because I don't have a car I cant never just go have time to myself when they start jumping down my throat I feel stuck and my anxiety turns into depression. 

I resent them both so much.

I can't believe that being an honest adult is such a rare and undesirable quality in a friend, and yet negativity is all I seem to get in response from practically everyone, which is why I'm pushing people away before they even get a chance to talk with me. I've gotten the same reaction for so many years from so many people that I can't really imagine a person wanting to actually get to know me. Why is my personal image so wrapped up in how others treat me? I feel crippled as a person under the weight of all this negativity.",24Oct2018,1

32,"Alright this is probably gonna get dark and fucked up and it’s going to be all over the place so readers beware. Ok so where to start I feel like I’m drowning, in what, I’m not really sure. Everything feels overwhelming but it also feels like I’m not doing enough about it. I was almost positive I was straight for a long time but I’ve been noticing guys more and more. But the thing is I don’t think it could ever be possible for me to have a boyfriend. I’m not romantically attracted to guys I just think they are hot. I get along better with girls and I feel I develop feelings for them romantically, sexually and just as friends. I don’t even know what to call that but I don’t know if it’s normal or not? I kinda use jokes to cover up anything that makes me feel any type of emotion. I’m enlisting into the Marines straight out of high school. I can’t tell you why but I feel like I need to or want to? My family feels like a sinking ship, I’m pretty sure my mom used those exact words. I distanced myself from my family again I really don’t know why but I think it will make things easier for me. This isn’t really supposed to be a sob story just me getting this shit off my chest so I don’t go insane, anyways. I don’t feel I’m man enough sometimes, probably something to do with my dad, but I feel like I’m overcompensating. I kinda become a pushover at the worst times. As soon as I’m faced against real authority I just become a lesser version of myself idk. I try to mask most of my insecurities with narcissism and a huge ego. I feel pretty guilty with a lot of the stuff that has happened to my family but I also feel anger towards them. I feel like my parents didn’t try hard enough to really build a life for us. Some days we’ll be fine but some it feels like we are falling apart. I have 4 siblings 2 are moved out of the house and I feel like I hate them. It feels like they abandoned me and my family but I would do the exact same. I don’t plan on sticking around and watch this ship actually sink. If I don’t fix myself soon I think I might end up hurting others around me. I’m not really sure what to call any of this but I have had therapists in the past and I haven’t liked them in the slightest bit. It seemed like a waste of time and they didn’t really tell me anything thought provoking they generally just said the same bullshit over and over again. I’ve been falsely diagnosed so much in my childhood and there was so much error and guesses and most of my medical both mental and physical diagnostics have been wrong. I was put on meds almost my whole life. I recently stopped taking them in the past year or so and I feel I have been doing better without them. I feel like I’m at such a natural disadvantage mentally and physically. It feels like no one really knows what I’m going through because I don’t really explain it that well and I really don’t even know. I literally have no idea what’s happening to me. If anyone read all of this I’m sorry. Any responses are welcome but I don’t even know if I’m looking for answers so feel free to comment literally anything.",24Oct2018,1
33,"I hate being at home with my mom and my sister! I mean don't get my wrong I love them but at this point I only love them because they're family and I feel like I have to, but they are the most entitled people I know. 

My sister is pretty much like every other 15 year old loud, mouthy, obnoxious, and arrogant, she takes being a douchy teenager to a whole new level. Her and I use to be close but now everytime she opens her mouth I want to punch her, she never has anything positive to say to me or about me. She LOVES to starts fights with me over the dumbest shit, Like asking for something when I a simple no answer she blows up saying something like ""wow someone is in a bitchy mood today what the fuck if your problem"" then she'll go on and on calling me a dumb bitch and fucker and any other absurd name she can come up with on the spot. Its not so much the names she's calling me its how shes saying and the reason why, she's not getting her way or what she wants so she has to make me feel like shit till I get to the point where I start yelling back witch I know doesn't help and is probably the reaction that she is trying to get out of me but when she starts going off and making digs at me and making me feel like shit about myself I start to make them back like telling her she talks like trash. I always feel really bad after talking to her like that but I just want her to feel the way I'm feeling. The one thing that annoys me the most is when I try to vent about it people just say of well thats what younger siblings are for.... Like uhh nooo I don't know anyone else who's younger sibling treats them the way my sister treats me. She uesing me as her verbal punching bag she really knows where to hit with her words to makes me feel like shit. But my sister acts the way she does and treats me the way she does because of my mother. 

My mother is actually the lest supportive and most selfish mother I know. She much rather see me sink then swim, she's never showed excitement or emotion to in anything I have accomplished. I was able to take college art classes in high school and get a dual credit and I graduated with a certificate in both high school and college and when I told her she didn't really seem to care and when I asked her what she thought about it she straight up told me that she doesn't want to deal with me when I start to get overwhelmed or stressed out. The one thing that made me feel the worst about myself is when she told I would never be a good mother and I would get my kids taking away from me. I have never gave a reason for her to think or say anything like that. I'm a very caring person and ues to baby sit kids all the time in my teen years. but she loves to throw that dig at me any chance she can. For her to think so low of me like that really hurts. I have really low of self-esteem and 95% of the reason I feel so shitty about myself is becuase of her and of the lack support I've got from her. Last year I was just kind of going through a rough time financially and had no way to get to work because I don't have a car and didn't have enough money to get a cab to work and back all the time and would ask her for a ride and she would make the bigest deal about it like I'm such an inconvenience in her life and how dare I ask her for help and when I call her out for not helping me she says I'm 22 and ahe doesn't have to do anything for me and I should figure it out myself, then I'd tell her normally parents would help out thier kids when they need help, and she says well I'm not a normal parents I don't have to do shit for you. I have so much hate towards her, I'm not sure if I'd go as fat as saying I hate her because at the end of the day shes my mom and shes the one that gave me life, but shes just the worst person to be around, or try to talk to when something is wrong, I never felt like I was able to talk to her about anything that was going so when it comes to expressing my feelings is extremely hard for me I'm just so use to bottling them up that when it comes time to talking about my feelings it just freeze up or I hold them in untill I can't handle it any more and have an emotional out burst of the smallest shit. I go through life with alot of anxiety because of her. when I'm around her or my sister for to long I feel very anxious, and because I don't have a car I cant never just go have time to myself when they start jumping down my throat I feel stuck and my anxiety turns into depression. 

I resent them both so much.

34,"June, 1st- Flea is dead, Sok saw it happen. Polly killed her. My baby's dead.


June, 2nd- I tried to get Flea, went on the cliff and trees, but I couldn't catch her. She kept floating, I tried so hard that my arms were cut. I'm the reason for her death. Flea wanted food so she came to me and squeeked. She was hungry so she came to me and Sok. Polly killed her, I had to pull a spike from his chin. Flea was outside my window squeeking, I went out and tried to get her.

Sok screamed for me that Flea's dead and that he died on a hungry stomach. Sok was and is in hysterics, crying about the rat. I picked Flea up and put her next to the other dead animal, but decided to put her in the other house to decompose. So I can have some of the rats bones. Hopefully Sok won't notice the smell. She was my pet afterall.


June, 3rd- I dreamed of a baby black bird instead of Antler in a house setting last night. I want to check his corpse soon but I also don't want to.

35,"Advice please.. i have been feeling so not myself this past week. Ive been unbelievably irritable and reclusive. I have been really annoyed at people just for wanting to have conversations with me (acquaintances that I would normally talk to), and I have been super irritated and almost angry at little things that I could usually brush off. Ive also been more anxious. 

How can I get back to normal? There havent been any life events to cause this. I took a nap and I was thinking of taking a day off to spend time in the sun and to take a long walk. What else can I do to feel better?",24Oct2018,1
36,"I want to get better but don’t know how. I don’t have enough self control to take control over my bulimia and it seems like the better I get eating disorder wise, the worse my anxiety becomes. 


Is there any other way to live? It seems like I don’t know how to live a normal life. I wish I could eat normally and I know my bulimia isn’t just going to go away one day but I wish that could be the case. It would be so amazing to wake up and have it all go away. Unfortunately getting rid of depression or an eating disorder actually requires self discipline and a real effort to make any noticeable difference.  It doesn’t just come to anyone. 



But then I wonder do I know how to live a life without my bulimia? My bulimia is a safe haven for me. When no one is there to comfort me or support me I always know the food will be there. I feel so much comfort and enjoyment in food. But couldn’t I just find that comfort and enjoyment in a real human interaction? Well, yes I could.... but sooner or later people always let you down. 


I need to get better. I’m so sick of living this miserable life. All I do is wake up, eat, throw up, and go back to sleep. I don’t even talk to anyone in real life unless they’re a delivery driver, food cashier, or the odd student at university. It’s  a miracle I made it to my last year of my under grad on time because of how many exams and assignments I’ve skipped cause I was too busy binging and purging and didn’t stop to work

38,"I'm vastly uninformed when it comes to the mental health profession. I know at the very least that I need to ask for help, but I'm afraid that if I mention that I have been thinking of suicide to any mental health professional, it'll become the focus and not simply a symptom that I'm not quite right.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't remember why exactly it began or when the first time I started making actionable plans was, but I do know it's been happening for a while. I don't want to make it the focus of any effort to help me, but I'm afraid that it's become like a switch that gets flipped and only has an on/off setting as far as the mental health profession is concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

So the advice I'm requesting boils down to this:

&amp;#x200B;

When undergoing a professional psychiatric evaluation, is there anything I can say that brings the details of my suicidal thoughts to the table while making it clear I don't need to be talked down from killing myself?

39,"I have a really bad - habit? - of projecting my insecurities on others.

And I mean ever - he's an exceptional husband), and even when I've had a positive interaction with my friends I'll just get paranoid that I said something dumb and now they don't want anything to do with me and be paranoid that they aren't messaging me because of that even when we've talked that day and everything has been fine which Is all the time.

I feel braggy saying this but people seem to say nice things about me all the time but I seem to expect people to constantly be up my ass praising me. But I know even if they did (case in point my husband) I would make up something else to be paranoid about.

But for some reason i notice now without weed even if I'm doing terrible i don't start to get depressed I just feel stressed and full of anxiety.

43,"Hello,   
 I’m writing this to because you are a friend or relative of mine and I care a lot about you. I’ve struggled throughout my life with a lot of complicated issues and they’ve put a lot of strain on my relationships. I know some of you feel frustrated when I say that you don’t understand what I’m going through or don’t have the complete picture. To you, this may come off as me being stubborn, naive, or young. To me, this tiny statement, has taken a long time to accept. 

I’ve spent most of my life masking the symptoms of some very severe mental health issues. Growing up, I put a lot of pressure on myself to be the ‘good kid’. I saw my siblings struggling and felt like I owed it to my parents to try and cause as little trouble as possible. When they found out that I was self harming, the reaction was really very negative. It was one of the first moments in my life that I realized that something was different with me that people wouldn’t always know how to respond to. 

I worked hard to keep most of my issues to myself. I worried that my family would be angry with me for the things I was doing to myself, or angry with me for being a burden on them by adding more problems to a pile that seemed big enough already. I didn’t know that suppressing things like that for extended periods of time only made them worse. I didn’t start receiving treatment for my mental illness until I was 18 and was in college. 

Right now, I have a few diagnoses. I have a dissociative disorder, recurrent episodes of severe depression, panic disorder, and OCD. I know that all looks like a laundry list of things you might not know a lot about. I also know that for a long time, most of my symptoms are things that you might not have noticed.

I’m not writing this because I feel smarter than anyone in any way, but because I NEED you to understand me. I need you to understand what happens to me *every day.* I feel so voiceless sometimes and like many of my loved ones only know a version of me that I kept up for so many years as a child and teenager, not the me that exists here and now.   


So what are all of these diagnoses?  


**Dissociative Disorder -** If you have ever been driving and ‘lost’ 15 minutes of time (where you don’t recall driving, or what you were thinking about, or anything at all) you’ve experienced a normal type of dissociation. Almost everyone experiences this.   
 When you have a dissociative disorder, you can ‘lose’ time unpredictably. You can be sitting at your desk at work on the phone and suddenly find yourself in the bathroom, outside, or someplace else. This is one of the ways my disorder shows itself.   
 Another symptom of this disorder that I experience very frequently is something called ‘depersonalization’. When this happens to me, it feels like I am watching myself do everything. This can last anywhere from ten minutes to the course of a day. It almost feels like you are seated behind your eyes, watching someone else control your body. The world can seem very scary when this happens, sometimes looking different than you may remember it looking before. I’m affected by this disorder every day, sometimes as little as 15 minutes a day, sometimes as much as 48 hours in a row. 

**Recurrent Episodes of Severe Depression -** When I’m experiencing a depressive episode, everything becomes very difficult. I usually need help making meals, struggle to get out of bed, and can’t focus on anything at all. These episodes usually last 2-10 weeks and often feature symptoms including self harm behaviors, suicidal thinking, inability to eat, insomnia, and intrusive thoughts about my own worthlessness. My depressive episodes are usually made a lot worse by my anxiety issues as well, which can cause me to be afraid to even leave my room.   
 **Panic Disorder -** The best way I can explain this to you is explaining what it might look like at work or at home. Let’s set the scene, I’m at work, have had a great morning, am drinking my coffee, and suddenly I feel the muscles in my chest tighten. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest but also in my fingers, my ears, my neck, and every part of my body. Suddenly, and for no reason that I can identify, I feel an uncontrollable urge to cry, but also to throw up at the same time. I usually will start getting dizzy, feeling disoriented, and will start to dissociate (how I explained before, I will start losing touch with myself, who I am, and where I am). This can happen 3-4 times in a given work shift. 

**OCD** \- OCD is the one disorder many of my loved ones have given me the most issue about. Because there are a lot of depictions of OCD on TV, many people think they know what OCD looks like. OCD has nothing to do with a fear of germs, a fear of crooked things, or being a neat freak. OCD stands for ‘Obsessive Compulsive Disorder’. What this means is that my brain will get stuck on a thought. Against my will, this thought will play on loop in my head. This thought is called an ‘obsession’. For me, this often has to deal with whether my loved ones are dead, whether my hands are clean, time, and whether or not I am lying.   
The second type of thought in OCD is the compulsion. This is just what it sounds like, it is a need to do something to make the obsessional thought stop.   
 It’s important to note that obsessions and compulsions are ‘intrusive thoughts’ which means that the person experiencing them does not want them, knows that they often don’t make sense, and wants them to stop.  
 For me, the symptoms of my OCD depend on the obsessional thought that is triggering them. There might be 5 hours before I need to leave for an event. Making lunch takes 20 minutes, but I will be so scared that there won’t be time to make it and clean that I will wait until after the event to eat.   
 Another example would be at work. When I’m washing my hands in a public restroom, if my hand touches the side of the sink, I can have a panic attack. Usually, to avoid this, I will need to wash my hands at least two or three times more. I’m afraid of paper towels that have touched the wall when coming out of the dispenser and will throw one out, wash my hands again, and try to get another if this happens. To be diagnosed with OCD, this type of thing needs to take up at least 2 hours of your day. When my symptoms are not being managed well by medications, my symptoms can take up to 6 hours a day. 

What The Future Might Be Like

The outlook for the illnesses I’ve described isn’t bleak, but it depends upon people having a strong support system. Medications and therapy can help, but none of these are things that people ‘grow out of’ or live their life without.  A strong support system starts with friends and family that say “we’re here for you” but is strengthened by people who say “I want to understand what you are going through. I want to learn to help you in the ways that do the most.” 

When my mom had cancer, I saw my family members learning more about cell division, experimental treatments, and lung health than I’d ever imagined they would. Learning about those things not just helped her through the process of getting treatments, but also said to her ‘I am with you. You are important to me.’

Mental illness is no different than physical illness. In order to help your loved ones, you need to know the monster that they are battling. You need to listen to their experiences and ask questions along the way. I have felt really lonely and isolated in my fight against all of this, and I don’t think that it’s for lack of my support system trying. I think until now, I’ve been fighting a monster in an area too dark for you to see. You’ve wanted to help, but until you can get a real picture of the monster you’re fighting, you don’t stand a chance at helping. I guess I’m trying to screw a lightbulb in, here. And I’m asking you to turn the light switch on.   
Thank you all for loving and supporting me this far. I hope that me taking the time to explain everything more helps. I love y’all. ",24Oct2018,1

46,"For the first time in my life, I'm going to get my feelings off my chest. My problem is that my social life is pretty much non-existent. I'm not a native english speaker and I'm going to be rambling so bare with me.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, my childhood. I'm going straight to the point, my parents were either dysfunctionnal or drugged and I pretty much had every abuse possible indirectly because of their poor judgement. The past does'nt bother me, but having context for my kind of mental health is good. My early years socially were... ok, my mother and I traveled the country therefore i changed school every year or so, but i was good at making friends! Then I realised what's the point anyway.

Now my teenage years to today (17 yo) . Moved with my father (more stable life). Same high school for years this time. High school was when I realised I wasn't like the other. I had absolutely no interest in friendship or relationship with a girl. So what I did is be ''friend'' with all the most funny and popular guys to be socially presentable and stayed with this circle until graduation. I was basically a fucking ghost, a background character, a npc from a videogame. I was the guy nobody wanted but the relief from a surprise group project when we were paired up. The weird thing is that in a beginning of a friendship I get complimented all the time '' You're so smart, funny, pretty, kind...'' almost worshiped and then they realised I'm cold and hateful mess after I get bored and exhausted from trying so hard to be relevent on a bad day...

my question is how to get diagnosed and if it’s even worth it. i’ve never been to a doctor for mental health issues so i don’t know how to go about doing it. would i just go to my family doctor and ask? and if it turns out that i do get diagnosed with social anxiety, is there anything that i can do about it? 
this has impacted my life as i’ve had to drop out of a couple classes in my lifetime due to being mentally incapable to handle group work &amp; discussing with people i don’t know. i’m extremely reluctant to meet new people which means making new friends and dating is nearly impossible. i feel insecure everywhere i go and feel like everyone is watching me when i’m doing simple things like walking to school or running errands.

48,"So, barring other things going on in my life, I seriously wonder how people with severe mental illness, or any at all, manage to work a full work week. It takes so much out of me, that I can barely manage it, and really I can't. 

I suffer from Depression, Anxiety, and OCD (different forms: HOCD, POCD and just regular constant obsessive thoughts throughout most of my childhood and adult life) and I think I might suffer from something else, maybe PTSD? I don't know. It isn't as bad as it used to be but honestly it controls a lot of my life. Like lately, I feel mostly okay when I'm home but I don't really do anything, but at work it is such a struggle, it is pure suffering. Knowing I have to be there 8 hours. Dealing with the people. Sometimes it just feels like there's a fifty pound weight on my brain and I'm going to fall head first into the floor and sink. 

Sometimes I just don't know how to get by and work. I need so much time to myself and I know it is unhealthy. I know a regular person needs to work. I know all of this but I find it so hard to rationalize it. My family has gotten mad at me for quitting and finding new jobs so often. ",24Oct2018,1
49,"Hey All, 

I'm not writing to anyone in particular. I guess, I'm mostly writing for myself because I need to in order figure out my thoughts. Just keep in mind I am not looking for pity or sympathy as I write this.   

I was diagnosed with vitiligo as a kid. Its a genetic skin problem where I have lost pigment in my skin in some areas. After years of bullying I came to terms with it. Its like its not even there for me. Then as a teen I was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) and subsequently hirsuitism (For a lady, I have waaaay more body hair then normal). And finally major clinical depression as the topper. Not to mention gaining about 50 lbs since high school. I'm finally figuring out my PCOS and getting a handle on my hirsuitism with meds with hair removal. I have friends who care about me, a supportive family, and I'm working on my master's in a field I used to enjoy. I also have the funniest dog on earth that I love to bits. 

Yet I still feel like everyday is a struggle, especially lately. I started the new school year great. Exercising daily, eating healthy, getting my grad work done. Now I can barely get myself out of bed to feed my dog. I can't sleep at night and during the day I barely have enough energy to get myself to work and back. I feel like if it weren't for my dog, I would just not get up at all. I quit exercising and forget eating healthy. Its whatever is easy and takes no effort on my part because I don't have the energy to go to the store and exist in the same space as other people, let alone the energy to prepare what I cook when I get home. And I don't know why I'm surprised because I've been in this loop of self-sabotage for years. I'll get healthy, mentally, physically, then it all falls a part again. And there really isn't a trigger to it, no reason, it just happens. And that seems like the most frustrating part. There is no reason for me to be this way, I just am. 

The worst part is that I feel trapped in my own body. I want myself to experience life, but I feel like I'm caged by some energy sucking force field. On occasion I can pull myself out, but its rare. And I feel like if I could just get rid of excess weight or body hair, or dye my hair red, or even move to a different state, then I could just be someone else better and not me.

53,"Sorry if this is a bit of a word babble, I’m kind of foggy at the moment. 

I’ve been struggling with my mental health for a while and yesterday the big breakdown finally happened. Luckily my mum was around and dragged me straight to the local doctors office to get me registered. The receptionist there gave me a card for Therapy For You, and said that that’s what they usually give people, give them a call while you wait for your paperwork to go through and for an appointment. I signed up online because the last phone call i made was to my boss actually wailing and sobbing, I’m so embarrassed 😩It looks to be a lot of online video CBT courses for stress, depression, bereavement etc., with the option to sign up for group or one-to-one therapies. I’ve tried to look for patient testimonials online but I can’t find anything bar what’s on their site, which are like the “Steve, 54” type of thing.  

I just want to know what sort of thing to expect, I’ve never done anything like this. I’m already freaking out about the doctor not believing me, that what I’m feeling isn’t genuine and i’ve just read too much stuff online (friends of mine have anxiety and depression issues, and I’ve looked at tons of online resources to try and make things easier for them) I’m not suicidal or in any danger of hurting myself, i just can’t live like this anymore and I need to get myself sorted out.

54,"I guess I just need to say something, to someone. Since I don't have anyone in my life I truly trust, I figure the next best thing is just saying something where no one knows who I am. 

I've struggled with mental illness pretty much my entire life, I'm now nearing 40. For the last several years, things have been better. By better, I don't really mean good, but manageable. I haven't had suicidal thoughts and I had stopped pushing people away.

That is, until this past week. This past week, I have started shit with the few friends I have, burning those relationships to the ground. I have completely removed myself from social media, with the exception of this account which I have hardly ever used. Basically, completely alienating myself. While I haven't been having suicidal thoughts again, per se; I am having thoughts that with no one in my life, it will be easier to do it if I needed to. 

Anti-depressants are not an option. Not only am I unable to afford them, but I feel numb enough inside as it is. I don't need drugs making me feel completely numb. 

I just really need something to grab a hold of and cling onto, something to stop me from drowning. ",24Oct2018,1

57,"Hey guys, I am new to this subreddit and need your opinion.

I spend a lot of time online, which over time has lead to being part of some internet fights. After each and every one of those I feel an urge to shut down all my accounts and disappear from the internet. Why am I doing that?

 I had an argument with a random dude the other day. There wasn't any name calling but there was some sarcasm and intensity in the conversation, or at least that's how I perceived it. My arguments were lacking and eventually I backed down and let the conversation die. I feel annoyed that I lost the argument, that I didn't put him in his place for the sarcasm and latent aggression. I feel like I want to disable my account, because I don't want this conversation associated with me, and I feel that I should remain a spectator and only browse the internet to get the information that I want instead of putting time into participating. And finally, I feel I'm being juvenile for feeling/thinking like that.

Lately, I think that this is happening to me in real life, too. I've been wanting to move abroad for a while and every time I have a fight with a family member I feel like I want to move away and never contact them again. I understand that my behavior is childish at best, my reactions are extreme and my reasoning/points are lacking and incompetent.

I am trying to understand why I am feeling like that? What is going on with me? Is it me just being bitter? Why can a fight (let alone a random fight with a stranger) get to me so bad? And how can I change that? I would love to be a super calm, untouched and unaffected person. Any thoughts?",24Oct2018,1
58,"9 weeks ago tomorrow I lost my best friend.

We spent every day together and were talking that morning. She had depression. We both do. We have our individual reasons and have suffered a long time. But there were no sinister signs. Her smile could light up any room and we were as close as twin sisters. We even wore matching outfits to events. We were ""those people"".

At 9:30am on the day we were discussing our weekend plans and deciding what to have for dinner. Everything was fine. At 10:20am there was a 12 minute phone call between herself and her not-so-close husband. She was dead at 11:11am.

Her husband is not a bad guy, but their marriage had been turmoil for years. Little things you know. A lack of communication, no intimacy, neither had said ""I love you"" since their wedding (5years).

My husband, my best friend and I were always together. We were the three muskateers. My husband had called her at 11am and she didnt answer which was strange. Her husband 'had a feeling' and went home to see her at lunch (rarely does he go home for anything). Sadly they found her hanging. I was there in 3 minutes, before the ambulance or police arrived. I tried so hard to keep her but she was gone. My first aid training was useless in this instance.

In her letter she mostly writes of her love for her gorgeous little girl (my goddaughter), how she 'has to do this' for her self respect, how she loves me and is sorry to leave me alone and how happy she was with me &amp; my husband.

I love her so much. So so so very much. Nearly as much as I love her daughter. I am happy in my marriage. I have a few life issues but who doesn't. I have never been suicidal. I have thought about alternatively lives but never truly thought of ending mine. Though she would probably tell you the same about herself. 

Since her passing, not a minute goes by without me thinking about her. This is normal. Also since her passing, not a day has gone by that I have not thought about my own death and how I can't wait to be with her. Again, I don't think I'm suicidal. I just want to be with my best friend. I just want to make sure she is happy now and at peace. I want to know that this was all for a purpose - her happiness. I want her to know how loved and cared for she is. I want to tell her myself. I don't know if these thoughts will ever end. I'm scared. 

At midnight tonight I will be spreading her ashes in the pacific ocean. Her favourite beach. I am on my way now. She would have been 28 years old tomorrow. Happy Birthday, my love.",24Oct2018,1

I have some ongoing serious mental health problems that my boss really does not understand and I don’t want to reveal to him. Something has happened that’s triggered some bad days for me this week and I can’t face leaving the house right now. I know it’ll pass in a few days though, always does. 
So I called in sick on Monday (actually I text my boss, as is normal in our company) said i’d been sick and wouldn’t be in, yesterday I did the same - both times I just got his standard reply back which is all fine. Today I did it again, but this time I panicked, because it’s the third day in a row, so I said “i’ll be off all week now - can explain more later if needed”. He just replied with “Call me later to explain”. 
Now i’m panicking like crazy because what the hell do I say to him later!?!? 
So what’s the best reason/excuse to be off work for a week? I know I probably should tell the truth but it’s hard and I know he wont get it, also i’m only on a temporary contract so any reason to get rid of me and they can super easy. I always do stuff like this and now i’m not sure what to do.

60,"Every now and then I have these kind of ""eureka!"" Newton's apple sort of realisation about different facets of my mental health. After a morning of being constantly teetering on panic attacks, I gave up and went home, where it dawned on me that the reason I am so damn hard on myself is because I don't believe I'm sick. More importantly, I think everyone has the same irrational thoughts and habits that I do, but they're better at dealing with them. Meaning that if I ""fail"", as I did by surrendering to the fears and going home, that I am weaker than everyone else that's able to keep on trucking through days no problem.

64,"  Sorry for the wall of text

     Just a little back story when I was around 10 years old I was diagnosed with ADHD and was given a medical prescription that lasted for about 6 months because we lacked funds to continue. 

     As the title says I don't have medicare I don't have any money for anything but my college tuition honestly if not for my mom (single mother of 3) I couldn't even pay for college or food for that matter but even then money is tight. But over the pass two years I have been having mental issues and they are only getting worst and I just want to know what can I do.

     The issues I am having are memory lapses throughout the day. I could be listening to my teacher talk about something then out of no where 10 - 15 minuets just pass worst one has been about 25 minuets. And this will again be me just listening then the next thing I will remember is the teacher talking about something different and 15 minuets passed, and I'll have no record of what happen not even slight day dreams and this can happen at nearly anytime it's like my body just goes autonomous and I just don't remember what happen. Then other times I will lose focus and just can't seem to concentrate for again minuets at a time and this happens allot I could be in class, reading playing video games and I will just be unable to concentrate. I'll start day dreaming usually and even in my mind I can try and tell myself to concentrate but I just can't and this can be a huge problem as It makes many things take so much longer than they should. They can make something as simple as 2+3=5 take minuets of time because I just can't focus. Lastly is my sleep I just can't seems to do it sometimes maybe for like a day and a half to two days then suddenly I'll sleep for 16 hours go to school and sleep for another 16 at really speratic times with no control even if I have all the lights off and am laying down doing nothing I will just think in my head or daydreams then next thing I know it will be time to go to school but other times I'll be just watching TV at 5 pm then next thing I know I'll be waking up at 10am late for school. So I'm at a real lost so this then causes lost of energy on days I can't sleep and on days I do I just feel really lethargic and don't want to do anything half the time. 

So I was just wondering what can I do as a student with no money to see a doctor. I was even rejected I think by medicare (something about not qualifying for the special registering period) and I don't even know how since my mom only makes like 17k a year oh and I don't have a job rn I tried but with all of these problems holding one was nearly impossible.

I am hoping you guys could help me out with something. I am wondering what a typical experience in a Psych ER is.

Specifically, I am wondering how normal or typical these things are:

Is it normal for them to not allow anyone to go in with you or for you to see the people who brought you in at any point?

Do they typically collect urine samples in store-bought Dixie cups?

Are you normally only limited to one phone call?

Is it okay for them to deny you your SSRI despite withdrawal symptoms?

What is the usual experience with the doctors? Do they normally not say anything to you other than “you’re being admitted” or “you can leave”? And is it normal to only speak to doctors and no social worker?

I would really appreciate hearing about other people’s experiences, particularly in terms of these issues.

I have decided that I want to get myself tested now because it will better help understand my problems and it could mean I get help with my university studies, which I have just started

Anyway. I asked my counsellor who I see once a week if she knew how I could get tested. She told me that I should speak to my university disability services so I did. They told me they couldn’t give me any support unless I had some kind of diagnosis and I asked how do I get diagnosed and they said speak to a GP. So I went to the doctors just now and he told me that I should speak to another counsellor and gave me their number

So basically I’m just gone around in a big loop

We’ve been together for a little over three years and up until recently, we were able to talk for hours; there would rarely be a silent moment between us. But now I have been noticing periods where we will be sitting together and he will be silent and unresponsive unless I shake his arm. He won’t have heard anything I said, and he would tell me that he thought he was talking to me.

I’ve been diagnosed with maladaptive daydreaming (as well as generalised anxiety disorder, dysthymia and autism spectrum disorder) so I can understand confusing daydreaming with reality, but this seems to only affect his conversations with others, especially with me. I will ask him what he thought we were talking about and he either forgets how his imaginary conversation went, or he will say that we were speaking about something that we weren’t talking about, but he will have thought we were actually having this conversation out loud. His memory seems to be affected negatively as well lately.

My boyfriend insists his mental health is fine though. I ask him how he is and his response is usually a one-worded answer such as “fine”, “okay”, “bored” or “hungry”. I think he’s been stressed out from sixth form though, even though he doesn’t like to talk about it. He was recently diagnosed with an underactive thyroid, could this be a reason why he’s been having imaginary conversations that he thinks are real?

79,"Up until just over a year ago, I was in talk therapy (CBT etc for depression and anxiety) for over three years, and it was great, but I decided to fly the nest and go without.

Well, since I've left, things have been alright, even though there have definitely been times where I've thought ""Fucking hell, I wish I had an appointment coming up, because X Y Z,"" as you'd expect.

Anyway, on to my question:

I've decided to go back (which will be in about 8 weeks after the waiting list etc is taken into account) because I just feel like I could do with it. There's no one reason or recent event that's made me feel like doing so; I just feel it would be beneficial.

The only ""problem"" is that the therapist I saw before (for the entirety of my previous three year stint) has since moved on to another job, so my question is this:

Does anyone here know what it's like to switch therapists?

The ideal scenario would obviously have been for me to drop in and sit down in front of someone that already knows me and I could just pick up from where I left off, but that's not obviously not going to happen.

My concern/apprehension doesn't come from meeting or confiding in someone new - I'm not shy - but I'm worried that it'll be like starting from scratch, and I'll have to fill in a lot of blanks, context and background information that my old therapist would already have been aware of, y'know?

I assume there'll be notes etc on me that the new person can refer to, but surely they can't cover all the bases, and they'll just be general outlines. In fact, would they even be allowed to look at them? I wouldn't mind, but I wonder re: confidentiality.

Anyway, that's my general question on the subject, and I'm interested to hear other people's experiences (if/how they adapted) if they don't mind talking about it.

80,"For 32 years I've loved listening to music, the tracks fill me with joy, make me move my body and was further helped by my strong fondness of rhythm and dance games that I would happily indulge in. While dancing was something i wasn't super good at I would at least happily partake in the activity as the music and social vibe helped motivate me.



Flashback 5 months back during a karaoke session with my group of friends. Which was once an activity I indulged in and overall a positive experience turned outright miserable to me. All of a sudden the act of trying to do karaoke disgusted me and I felt ""fake"" to the point where I refused to go up. My friends around me who were happily signing along started to really annoy me and I grew to hate being there. I made up a BS excuse and left the area and swore to never again go to a Karaoke room.


A month later a new dance game came into my local arcade which looked really fun to play. My girlfriend and friends were interested in it and while I could see how well made the game was I had no desire to play. In fact playing the game in general just disgusted me as I felt absolutely ZERO interest to even look at it and the idea of my playing felt me with disgust, a similar feeling I had in Karaoke. A few weeks later we would return to the same machine for a big dance sessions my girlfriend and I had with a bunch of mutual friends. It was on that day I realized that I did not like dancing anymore and when I told everyone else, while a bit surprised, understood my feelings and kept playing. However as I watched everyone play and have a good time I felt absolutely miserable. The arcade was full of dance and ticket games (stuff that I loved to play) which only felt me full of misery and I just wanted to leave. I told my girlfriend to never take me to another session (which she understood) and I haven't stepped foot inside that arcade.


After that incident I realized that I have completely lost my physical and emotional connection to music. I couldn't tap my fingers to the beat or even bob my head. Songs I used to like simply ""bounced"" off of me and it was only an intellectually stimulating activity for me as I took time to just listen and analyze the way beats and melodies worked. After trying to listen to different tracks of genres, countries and eras and getting the same results a friend recommend I just ""take a break from music"" which I followed. I stopped playing music on youtube, I downloaded podcasts to listen at the gym and while driving I switched to NPR to listen in on talk shows and interviews. If the NPR machine switched to a music portion I would change stations until I found a talk show.


It's be 5 months since I took my break from music and my situation has gotten worse. Music playing on speakers or from my coworkers playlists is starting to really irritate me. If I listen to music I feel miserable, if I'm around people who are listening to a song and singing/dancing along I also feel miserable. If I watch people play music or see a TV show about a character that performs or creates music I feel miserable. Heck I was listening to a friend's podcast (one that I used to listen to regularly) and they were talking about how DDR shaped their lives and that ALSO made me feel miserable. 


In the aftermath of all this I took even more drastic steps, I started turning off music in the video games I'm playing. My girlfriend and I are about to go to Disneyworld and I requested we avoid all shows and parades so I don't hear music. We also canceled our trip to MAGfest as it is a games and music festival full of DJs and people dancing around which I know will trigger one of my moods. For the upcoming holidays I'm going to start using my noise canceling headphones for when we walk around so I don't get bombarded with Christmas music or hearing bands and communicating with my girlfriend via bluetooth headset so I can speak to her. My good friend is getting married and I know for a FACT I'm going to decline his invitation on account he will have a DJ and a dance floor and I will feel like crap. I've left groups that used to focus on dance games, limited my social appearances and stopped accompanying my girlfriend to dance tournaments. More and more I'm cutting out stuff I used to want to do because I just hate music that much more.


The reason for me going into so much depth on this subject is because I haven't found anyone else who is going through this same deal. The few people who I've told this to just go ""man that sucks"" and move on. People who I've read about not liking music take it more as a personal preference as opposed to the media making them feel sad. Even worse is that I feel trapped with sharing this information to people as without an understanding, people might treat it as a joke, that I'm being a hipster or hard to please or that it's not real. The very idea of hating all music to the point it makes you miserable sounds utterly unreal and it's a fact that I can't make sense of it myself and I have no way of pointing out what exactly caused all of this. It's like there was a switch in my brain and just one day it got flipped off and I've been suffering the consequences ever since.


Google is not helping me, my friends can't help me and I'm sure my doctor would have no idea what is going one. If I can't be fixed then at least I want to know why am I like this. If there's any, ANY insight you all have, please share as I'm confused, suffering and alone in this matter",24Oct2018,1
81,"For some context, I have never suffered from any major mental health issues. I am diagnosed with anxiety, but I don't give that diagnosis too much weight because I don't feel like the anxiety I experience is much out of the norm of anxiety everyone has from time to time. It is not something that interferes with my day to day life and I don't have panic attacks or any similar  physical manifestation of inner anxiety on any kind of recurring basis. 

I have been very blessed in having a very normal, non-traumatic, easy going life. No significant residual emotional issues from past events or child hood.

But for the past year especially I have had a really hard time with what I guess would be called ""depersonalization"". I'm not happy, but I'm not unhappy either, I'm not sad, nothing makes me feel excited. I feel sometimes like I'm in more of a dream like state, though sometimes it's worse than others.

I have been blaming it on getting ""older"". I recently turned 30, and I just blamed my lack of emotion on life not being as exciting as it use to be when I was 23 and always hanging out with friends going to do things. All my friends got married, had kids, we don't do things like that much anymore. That does make me a little sad, but at the same time I'm so disinterested in literally everything I'm not sure I'd jump at the opportunity to get together with them and run around like old times if the opportunity came up. 

I have recently been more concerned that it's something a little more than just normal age progression life changes though. I have been dating a guy for almost a year who is very caring and wonderful to me. We live together and have his 4 year old daughter from a previous relationship a couple days a week. 

His daughter did something one day here recently (can't remember what) but I made some statement along the lines of ""she has been bouncing off the walls today"" and shook my head. His response was ""Yeah, but you love her!"" I responded with something like ""of course I do"". But honestly it really hit me then that I had absolutely zero emotional connection or attachment to her. She's not a bad kid, and aside from normal toddler stuff... She's not a source of any kind of negative feelings for me. I accept her as my own and in no way treat her in an unloving way. I considered how i would feel if we broke up and I never saw her again, and to be honest, I don't foresee that being something that would even bother me. For some reason I just haven't emotionally bonded with her. I know she isn't my biological child and Im not going to necessarily have that automatic connection like her mother does, but still. 

I love my boyfriend, I truly do. But I am largely indifferent when it comes to needing any kind of attention from him. I am very independent and have never been a needy type person, so this isn't a massive new development but more often than not I just want to be alone. I don't know. 

I just wanted to give some context on ky thought process. There's no ""relationship problems"" to analyze, or anything like that. The depersonalization feelings started creeping in before I met him anyway. Having interactions with him and his daughter just made me realize how significant it was. Even apart from that, I have just become completely unmotivated, lazy, and ""reclusive"". 

I read that depersonalization is often connected with anxiety disorders but I just don't understand how my ""anxiety"" diagnosis could be of any help in connecting the dots here. I would understand it if maybe I had some PTSD experience or trauma that would cause this to happen, but I just don't. 

The only medicine i take is Vyvanse to help with a life long issue of frequent sleepiness no matter how much I sleep. The medicibe does as it should and I function awake and normally since I've been on it. Its not a new med, I have been on it for years. I have had every test known to man to try and figure out why I stay sleepy all the time when unmedicated, but doctors never figured it out and I am otherwise healthy.

82,"I'm highly judgmental of myself and my life and sometimes constantly ruminate over whether I've made the right choices or if I'm ""worthy"" of my responsibilities and not just a useless good for nothing tool.

With regards to this, being criticized about myself in anyway or form for example how I'm kind of a loner or asocial make me anxious and defensive. I guess it is something I'm insecure about because it's so abnormal but I just don't like to be around people too much unless I really really like or love them.

So just today for example a sibling was criticizing me for not keeping in touch with my friends and immediately I felt bad and tried to defend myself by saying I'm happy as I am. She said that's fine and all but that I should really have a social life as it's important.

Though what she was saying was logical and in my best interest I became quite easily angry at her for not just ""accepting"" that I just don't ever feel like socializing much. I kinda started raising my voice when she became insistent and I ended up making her upset. I can't control my anger in these situations. I love her very much but this kind of thing happens often when I'm criticized about myself which made her say I'm very difficult to talk to. 

I've started CBT for my OCD just yesterday and was wondering if you guys could help me to understand if my anger outbursts have anything to do with my OCD or if that would just be an excuse for me being an asshole? Are my insecurities related to my OCD or a separate thing? Thanks.",24Oct2018,1

84,"Greetings.

Ive been having a chronic, recurring obsession with a girl for the last 5 years now.

I first met her at a job. She was dating someone, but she became really flirty with me. I thought she was interested, and then she started flirting with another guy and i got angry at her. I would eventually leave that job, and try to ignore her.

The next job i get, she goes to. We end up working in close proximity. I initially try to be friends with her, but devolve into trying to be intimate with her. She toys with me for a bit, and then i lash out e verbally at her through text. I leave that job. I end up having a really weird mental situation happen, where i just lay in bed for 2 days and try to control my thoughts. Id describe it as a flood of thoughts just streaming into my head and im trying to just calm myself down. I eat almost nothing for those two days.

Since that point, ive been thinking about her every day, and its been 3 years. Ive dated and slept with other girls, ive gotten new friends, my life is pretty good in terms of finances etc. But i just cannot stop thinking about this person. Im afraid to go to certain cities that she may be in, its a struggle to stay off her instagram (which i have done successfully only until recently when i failed). I feel like this infatuation is just destroying me. If i see anything that reminds me of her i just feel like shit.

I failed again recently, i found her on snapchat and began sending her messages. She obviously didnt respond. I caught myself, then blocked her from my list.",24Oct2018,1

88,"Sorry if this doesn't belong here but i am having a hard time coping.

So recently ( a little over a month ago) i quit drinking redbull all at once. I was drinking anywhere from 24 to 32 ounces a day for almost 6 years. I know not the healthiest but it kept me going. Since quitting though i have noticed a large spike in anxiety and depression. I will literally just start freaking out and crying over the stupidest stuff. I didn't think quitting redbull of all thing had anything to do with it until today when i decided its been awhile and i could really use a redbull. After consuming the 16 ounces of sweet sweet energy, all of a sudden i was ""normal"" again. I am no longer freaking out over small stuff that has no impact on my life anymore. I could actually function normally. I was so depressed that i felt the whole world was against me, I couldn't concentrate on work, my family, or my friend up until this morning after drinking another redbull. Has anyone else who have tried to quit after drinking so much had any issues like this? If so what could i do to help it as i don't want to drink redbull everyday anymore, but i would rather slowly poison myself than deal with the depression i was living with, it was debilitating.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record i have never had depression before this, and my life is extremely stable with no reason for me to have dpression currently, I can't link it to anything else aside from quitting redbull.

90,"This is long, so feel free to just read the TLDR or skim the post. 

**TLDR** - I find myself ruminating about and mentally preparing myself for tragedy by fantasizing about tragic scenarios so I'll be more prepared if/when they happen, reading through forums dealing with bereavement or terminal illnesses, etc. I also find myself seeing (or looking for?) supernatural/ominous ""signs"" and intuitions that might signal tragedy is about to happen. Have lots of other issues dealing with extreme mistrust, concerns about physical safety and privacy, excessive and exaggerated guilt, existential despair, etc. 

I find myself constantly ruminating about tragic scenarios. My mom was traveling out of the country recently. Many nights all I could do was stay up and think about how she would cope if me, my dad, and my siblings were to die of carbon monoxide poisoning. What would she do with herself for the rest of her life? How would she live on? Would her life have meaning anymore? My dad left the house the other day and I didn't say goodbye. I caught myself thinking about what would happen if he were to die of a heart attack that afternoon. What would the immediate aftermath be like? How would I reflect on the event years down the line? How would I cope? What lessons might I learn? 

I frequently read through forums that deal with bereavement and terminal illnesses, so that I’ll be prepared if I ever become terminally ill or if a close family member becomes terminally ill or dies unexpectedly. I sometimes weigh various tragedies and group them into categories of a) my life can still have meaning after this, or b) that would be so tragic, I might as well kill myself afterwards. I try to see if I can mentally maneuver myself into putting most situations into category one. 

There's obviously a significant element of anxiety, but it isn't just that. It almost feels like I'm preparing for something? And most of the time I just feel somber, sad, and heavy, not even the ""anxious"", panicky kind of anxiety (though I obviously feel that too at times). I would say that every day I'm mentally preparing myself somehow for all sorts of tragedies, just in case. Not doing this feels very wrong, like I'm letting my guard down. 

I've come to realize recently that I see (or look for) signs in little things. I try to push these thoughts away but it's hard to not engage with them. Reading stories in the same vein of ""the day I found my mom’s body after she passed during the night, I just knew something was wrong when I woke up"" or “when my sister died in a car wreck, I had this feeling that something wasn’t right before I even got the call” has seriously messed with me. All the time I question if I'm getting that sort of supernatural feeling, and if I should be doing something with it. Last words said on the way out the door, the context of various situations, weird dreams, even the time of the year, etc. - it could all potentially mean something bad is about to happen. I'm not religious at all, so it feels ridiculous that I would be seeing/searching for signs in anything. Just last night I woke up in the middle of the night and got this ""feeling"" that maybe my mom had died in the middle of the night, and she's down the hallway, dead, and I wouldn't even know it. I thought ""maybe this is the supernatural, ominous feeling people talk about."" I tied to go back to sleep and resist the urge to confirm this suspicion, but I eventually broke. When I heard my dad get up to go pee, I texted him and asked him if he could check on her. 

Viewing the world through this lens is exhausting. I was pretty morbid as a kid, but I don't think things were ever this bad. Around the time I was 18/19 things started getting much worse. I started viewing the world as a very hostile, threatening place. People can't be trusted, bad things are happening all around me, bad things could happen to me at any moment. I feel very jumpy being in crowded places with lots of strangers around, and I have lots of fears about things that none of my friends or family members seem to think about very much - be it a family member getting attacked by a rapist/murderer, or anything related to the surveillance state and being secretly spied on. It’s worn me down so much. I feel like I’m constantly going to be either physically attacked or bombarded with horrible news. The scenarios I conjure up in my head are ridiculous too - I’m being secretly recorded through my bedroom window, could that crack in the wall have a camera in it? (obviously not...), my sister got kidnapped walking to the mailbox, maybe my dad is secretly some sort of psychopath, is that person sitting in their parked car next to me going to attack me, etc. Sometimes these thoughts are fleeting and only last a moment or two, sometimes they’re much more insidious and I find myself altering my behavior and acting out in response to them as if they were actually reasonable things to be concerned about (even though a part of me knows they aren’t). Even if I may logically know what is and isn't true, it certainly *feels* very real, so much so that my judgment can slip temporarily. 

I also deal with guilt to a pretty extreme degree. Last Winter was very especially hard. I remember crying almost every night because I was so preoccupied thinking about stray animals. I almost felt responsible somehow, like I could fix the problem if I really wanted to and just choose to turn my attention elsewhere (I know that's ridiculous). I avoided leaving my house after a certain hour because it was easier to pretend the weather wasn't so bad if I couldn't feel it. I felt guilty and somehow wrong when I sat down to eat good food, so much so that I'd feel sick afterwards. You get the picture. 

I feel like I’ve started looking at life in this overly existential way, like life is some sort of moral zero-sum game: tragedies balancing out good fortunes, how much you repent and atone for the bad things in the world might influence how many terrible things might happen to you during your lifetime, being “aware” that some tragedy is about to happen might cancel it out somehow, etc. 

I would describe myself an extremely private, untrusting person who tries their hardest to appear open and carefree to the people around me. Keeping up this facade is becoming more and more difficult with each passing year though. I feel like the few people close to me don’t even know who I am, my whole life feels fake and inauthentic. I'm not sure what to do. I've tried taking antidepressants and they really didn't do much for me except make me more anxious and agitated (granted I've only tried atypical ones, but so many people in my family have responded terribly to SSRI's that I don't even want to bother trying them - being dulled in any way is an absolute hard NO for me).

M19 - So 5 years ago (I was 14 or so) I had really serious mental health issues. I had a depression and I went under a lot of stress. I went to the psychiatrist and I guess think it helped a bit, but still. Anyway, one day I had a terrible breakdown and I tried to kill myself. Afterwards, I was in the hospital for 2 months. Only the closest members of my family know of it (because my parents told them), but I have never told anyone, even my best friends (I told them a car knocked me down). I always felt terrible about it but my doctor told me I didn't *have to* tell them so that was it.

I guess he knows or suspects (tbh the car accident thing isn't really credible xd) what happened to me; at least he knows I had mental health issues around that time. He told me it could be good for me to talk about it. I know I don't have to do it but for some time I have thought of telling someone. The thing is, we are not in touch as much as in High School and I'm not sure about it.

My girlfriend has had social anxiety ever since I met her (at 18). But it was manageable. Sometimes she’d have delusions that people are talking about her or little sounds or anything really is targeting her. Currently it’s really bad. My gf can’t go to work at all. She hasn’t been at work in 2 months. For the past 2 years she’d work intermittently. She’d go for a few weeks, or a few days a week and stop for 3 weeks or longer. She works for her mother so she’s able to do all of that I suppose and have a job still. 

We stopped eating out because it’s too much anxiety for her. Any place is too much anxiety. Even at home, she interprets noises such as neighbors doors closing or cabinet or anything at all as them talking about or signaling that they know about her breathing pattern and in turn know what she’s thinking about. “Every time I relax they do that” she says that about some random sound they make. She’s constantly looking out of windows and listening to the walls. She stopped sleeping in our bed in the morning because neighbors leave for work/school in the morning and make noise. She sleeps in a different room with fan on for white noise. 

Now she always had this form of anxiety. What I described above is the current situation. But it wasn’t always like that. She used to feel safe at home for the most part. She used to be comforted by me. She didn’t used to listen to walls and look out of windows constantly and thinking about the neighbors all day every day. 
When she used to go to work sometimes she’d have bad days but she still “functioned” I feel like now she can’t do that. 

IMPORTANT: she refuses to go to therapy because her insurance covers some but she has to pay $60 per visit. Obviously because she doesn’t work she doesn’t have money for it. She isn’t accepting my help to pay for it. She has been to therapy but quit after 2 weeks. Her mom paid for them. 

She refuses to try anything that anyone advises that might help (besides therapy) like meditation or whatever else. 

I simply don’t know what to do. I try to push her to go to therapy or try anything but she refuses. I feel like she’s just hiding from the world right now and her current lifestyle or day to day life is probably making things worse. She has noticeably gotten worse over the past 2 years.

I don’t know how to start, I wanna speak to someone or get help somehow but I will never open up to anyone. I could only open up to someone if I knew they would never go near me again, or be dead.

I went to my doc a while ago for something, one of the root causes of my anxiety (the doc for sure has an inkling of it)  and wanted to bring up mental health but couldn’t bring myself to it. I don’t know how they would respond and I despise talking about it. Would I get medication to make me feel better or would I be given advice such as meditation or breathing exercises? Because I know I wouldn’t do that shit because I know advice isn’t gonna work.

I’m a really emotionless, but considerate  person, I feel like I take everything for granted when I shouldn’t. Like if a family member died or my best friend were to die in an accident, I know I probably wouldn’t care, and if it was then I could just end my life

I haven’t been diagnosed if I were to be diagnosed with depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder. I go from thinking about suicide and fantasising about death everyday to being pretty happy for the next few days.

When needed, I’ll put on a ‘happy personality’ for people. This is mainly at work (I work in a restaurant and have to serve people) and it’s the most uncomfortable thing I’ve done because I can’t be myself and my anxiety goes over the fucking roof such as when I’m forced to introduce myself to other employees I forget their name the instant they mention it because I’m too worried about myself and how I come across. Having to put on a smile for customers is depressing but by the end of my shift I’m too tired to give a shit. I try to speak as little as possible out of nervousness and rather nod/shake my head rather than say yes or no and explain why.

I’ve never had severe panic attacks, more mild ones. One time was when I was at school and someone recorded me talking to someone for a few seconds. I went to the toilet for 20 minutes and broke down, I wanted to die in that moment.

I ruin my friendships because of myself. I don’t want to meet up with people, I don’t like talking to people apart from people over the internet (I play PC games) because I don’t have to worry about myself when I talk, it’s just me and a microphone, and I can go absent at any moment.

I’ve gotten to know a couple of people, I don’t know why they would wanna be around me because I’m the most awkward person to hang with and also have other issues.

I can’t even be myself around my family and refuse to talk to anyone about my more detailed reasons. I have to put on a different personality around my Mum and relatives because I don’t want them to suspect anythings wrong.

I am a 21m who is currently working a 75 hour work week along with online full time college. I live in a rural town with a pop of 350 (consensus info). The closest therapist is a 3 hour drive which is why I haven’t taken that course as well as don’t have the money to pay or any kind of insurance. I have a lovely girlfriend who per-say isn’t necessarily the smartest but we get by, we put everything on my shoulders including three of her college courses because I want to see her succeed and I always say I can handle the work and the weight on my shoulders even though deep down it’s kinda tearing me apart. 

Anyway on the why I am posting this.

For almost a year and a half it feels like I’m just sleepwalking through life, I don’t find enjoyment in anything anymore. When I’m happy doing something I love (coaching my brothers youth soccer leagues) I just don’t feel really happy. I am usually stressing about what I have to do at work or what time do I need to leave early to make it to work on time or what homework is due that specific day and it’s just always something. But on the flip side I don’t get sad or upset, I just shrug my shoulders and say whatever and move on. I don’t think I’m depressed, I’m just not happy either. It’s almost like my entire life is grey and everything around me is so dull.  

I attempted to talk to my girlfriend about this, but she was very dismissive and not taking it serious. In her words “ at least you’re not sad or depressed, it could be worse.” Well right now I feel worse than when I went through my depressed time when an ex-fiancé of 4 years cheated on me during her time at a university. My Girlfriend doesn’t really understand my situation and she’s just happy I’m not depressed anymore. 

This life I’m living right now just doesn’t feel like it’s worth living. I’m not depressed or sad, it’s just all so much. Between the jobs, the 24 credit hours of college, and the inability to change any of that. I just feel so trapped. I don’t know what to do and I just want to feel something again. I just want to be happy again. I’m crying writing this because I’ve never shared with anyone and it’s just all so much. I need things to slow down.

My family isn’t the kind of family I can share with, they are very closed minded and believe mental illnesses are a persons doing. That you can control those things without medication or a therapist and I’m trying my damndest to make everyone proud and happy. But I’m just not fucking happy. I just want to be fucking happy again.

105,"So I've come on today to ask a question or to see if anyone knows what's going on with my brain. I suffer from anxiety first and foremost and I'm pretty sure it's what causes this thing. It's been happening as long as I can remember...I'm 28. Every now and then the voice that I talk to myself/think in gets really loud and frantic. You know that voice you think in? Its like the volume and speed get turned up without my consent and I can't turn it back down. They're not intrusive thoughts or unconcious thoughts. They are totally concious normal thoughts like ""what do I feel like for dinner?"" For example and it will suddenly just be shouted really loudly and panickedly in my mind. I try to turn down the volume but have no control. Once it starts happening I generally feel a bit frantic and panicked but it's because of my lack of control rather than me being frantic and panicked to being with. I'll just be moving normally and doing things normally and the contrast of my mind feeling extremely loud and frantic without my control is disconcerting. Sometimes calm breathing helps but mostly it just happens for a while and then the volume goes back to it's normal level and calmness. It's disconcerting and ive just been wondering lately if anyone else experiences this and knows why it's happens? Any help would be great! I'm not scared by this. It's just weird! ",24Oct2018,1
106,"This is gonna be a weird post and I wasn't sure where to put this but I just really need to scream into the void right now.

I'm in a constant state of being mostly fine, except there are these constant negative undertones to absolutely everything. Eigher I'm worrying about something, I'm stressed or annoyed at something minor or someone is absolutely refusing to pick up on the fact that I want them to leave me the fuck alone (looking at you Jonathan). 

But I push through all the stress from school, I put up with people I hate and ignore all the annoying shit. And what do I get? Good grades and a few people to play CS:GO with, neigher of which make me happy. But hey, at least I'm not starving to death in Africa, am I right?

How is this enough? How is getting good grades in any way compensating for the pain of being alive? I'm fucking pissed. This is all I'm gonna get: an ok life with a few happy memories if I'm lucky and white noise in between with a good helping of annoying, stressfull, pointless shit sprinkled over everything. There's obviously something I'm missing. Other people can just be ""thankfull for what they have"" or have ""good and meaningfull realtionships"" and that makes them happy. Can someone please show me how that's supposed to work? This has to be some kind of cruel joke and I don't find it fucking funny. 

Fuck being alive. Fuck life.",24Oct2018,1
107,"We basically came to the conclusion that I have literally like 30 layers of defense mechanisms that explain why I am so anxious and unsure in social situations, and why I'm so afraid of vulnerability. I'm so glad to recognize this. It gives me hope that I can get better.",24Oct2018,1
109,"Hello everyone! I have lost the motivation for basically everything but I keep on fighting thru my everyday life due to strict habits (I’ve had a sport to think of for the last 6 years and still do so I have to keep up with my routines).

I feel like my day has just gotten monotone and I feel constantly alone. Except those few moments (3-5 times per week) where I feel really happy and as if my life is gonna take a turn towards the better where I can feel happier than what I usually feel. Because as stated it feels kind of monotone. The best way to describe it would be not feeling anything, just being empty/sad and empty.

Do any of you guys have any tips for what one should do in this situation? And have any of you ever felt the same?",24Oct2018,1

111,"Hi everyone. Using a throwaway.
So I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I guess that’s just a bit of background information. Recently went through a lot financially, and it caused something new to occur. 

I have noticed recently that I feel as if someone is out to get me. Like someone is constantly standing by me, just waiting to get me. I have no reason to feel this in a realistic aspect, as in, no one would be actively following me for going on two weeks now. I constantly feel like people have their eyes on me, not like they’re glancing at me, but as if they’re watching my every move.
I also have found that I zone out a lot more than usual. I’m talking to someone, completely space out, realize that I was talking to somebody, and they have to jog my memory as to what I was talking about. I thought that was normal but it’s been happening a lot more recently. I was in class today, knowing I had to take notes, and when my professor started lecturing I couldn’t focus. I knew he was talking, but his words were not even remotely reaching my brain. I actually did not understand what he was saying, and not in a “I don’t understand this concept kind of way”. It was like I forgot english and I could read and listen to words, but they had no impact on me. I knew I had to take notes, but I couldn’t make myself do it. My body felt stiff and the zoning out continued. This happens when I’m just standing around as well. 
I can’t tell if this is just my anxiety or something else. But any tips on how to deal and get out of these situations would really, really help.

112,"*cough cough*, okay so I will never do these acts irl, but whenever I get really angry at someone, I imagine hurting them in extreme ways at night, it’s like a way to unleash my rage without doing anything. But at the same time it scares me cause I feel like if anyone knew I’ll be locked up ASAP cause well...the ideas are very violent and I rather not go into detail. 

Does anyone else experience anything like this??? I’m panicking like what if I’m a psycho and new horror movie character?????? Aaa",24Oct2018,1
113,"Emotionally numb, cant form serious relationships with girls, i easily get angry sometimes. I cry like once a year. Cant keep hobbies for more than a week. Mother and father issues.

These are just some of the things that have been personal red flags for me, can anyone take a guess on whats happening to me or should i go directly to a therapist?",24Oct2018,1

115,"Got in a a hit a run and found out Sunday morning. From my state of being frantic; I didn’t get my Clonazepam*** out of my car when it was towed and taken to the car shop. 

I called to tell them I left medication in my car and I wanted to come pick them up. I keep them in my car in case of a panic attack or when I desperately need them when I have conferences all day etc. I rarely carry a purse and being a girl I have v small pockets. 

This whole week has been one thing after the other where each day I end up crying and shaking and it stems from all the stress and anxiety from this car accident; everything you think can go wrong has this week including rental/claim adjuster/ debit card/auto shop. 

 I drive down there. And when I get there, my medication is no where to be found in my car. I know exactly where I left them cause I don’t move them, because I’m prone to losing things unless I have a designated spot for them. 

So now as I try not to just drink an entire bottle of wine and pass out. I’m trying very hard to use other coping mechanisms. I have high functioning anxiety. This week has just worn me down so much and I know it’s not going to get better. And I really really don’t want to deal with this anymore and I don’t know what to do. Because honestly that’s all what was getting me through was knowing I could take them for the rest of the week; be numb and not have to deal with the heightened anxiety do to all the issues surrounding this accident. 


*** I use Clonazepam very rarely, because I do have my calming self care methods thanks to my therapist as well as Doctor. I just moved from Dallas to Austin, and this prescription was suppose to last me a year. That’s how often I use them , and because it’s a controlled substance my Doctor can’t order me any more outside of the city of Dallas. And so now on top of this all I have to get my medical records consent of release, find a doctor down here who excepts my insurance, then let them probe me to see if I actually need it.


And right now the easiest thing I can think of is just kinda dying. It’s not worth feeling like this, and knowing it’s not ending anytime soon and how much I have to do to maybe even feel a little better doesn’t seem worth it.

117,"Hey everyone,

I'm not sure how to start this so I'll just type as I go. As the post says my mother has schizoaffective disorder. She's dealt with it for a long while and I've had to see the strange effects of it for as long as I can remember. Or at least what I can remember, because most of it is completely lost to me. Most of the worst things I hear about are things that I can't recall at all, and I rely on my older sister who had to take charge more than I did.

That's not to say they didn't happen, there's plenty of stuff that I do remember but that's going on a tangent.

For me I'm in a strange situation. My mother hasn't had an episode like this in about a decade. Because of this I don't have any experience in trying to help her out, since for most of my life I've zipped up into a mental shell and just let things go by. Now that I have the world under my feet instead of dangling from a mental cliff I feel like I need to help her and act as something to bring her back to ground level.

If anyone here has had to deal with a family member with schizoaffective disorder or something similar, I could really use some advice on how to help her out. I plan on dropping by her place tomorrow and talking with her for a bit, but I don't know what to do other than act normal and be positive.

I was thinking of either buying some food to cook or getting some takeout. Food is always the great equalizer when it comes to interaction and conversation. If anyone else has other suggestions I would love to hear it.",24Oct2018,1

121,"I was casually riding my bike home from my boyfriend’s house to mine when of course I had a small OCD attack of thinking that I wanted to kill myself. I got home safely, as I’ve never acted on an obsession. Only a minute later sirens beamed through the window of my living room, and naturally since I live in a quiet community I went outside to check things out.

I saw my neighbor and she explained that there was a very serious car accident at the exact location my bike crossed. My next door neighbor’s car was totaled (luckily no one was in that car since my aunt, uncle, and cousins are those neighbors) and apparently an elderly man driving with another elderly person hit my aunt’s parked car after dosing off behind the wheel. 

One of the passengers wasn’t wearing their seatbelt and when through the windshield, left unconscious. The driver was in and out of consciousness in a neck brace. I am completely shaken. For one, my cousin (my best friend) could’ve been in his car. Also, if I left my boyfriends a minute later than I did I could have been involved in this accident myself.

Although I’ve been on the verge of a panic attack since the incident, the experience has made me realize how much of a gift life really is. Holy. Shit.",24Oct2018,1
122,"Hi there,

I can't explain how I am feeling besides this total sense of depression right now. I feel numb to myself and my surroundings. I just binged on a big bowl of pasta to feel further away from any sense of reality.

I am based in London and I just feel like I am losing any reason to live. I have my friends and family and love them dearly. But I feel like I've got other stuff in my head that leaves me empty and overwhelmed.

 I've been struggling with work and really want to find a recruitment agency to help me find a new job/work. Any suggestions would be good.

My true passion is in the arts and creative writing. I feel like it's so hard for me to finish a project because I am scared of failure.

I am also scared of rejection/humiliation/embarrassment with intimacy and asking a guy out on a date. It's an ongoing issue for me and all I would want is the courage to ask a cute guy I meet in real life on a date. But I am convinced they will say no without any other terms needed.

Something that causes me anxiety is when I see two cute guys or a group of guys and I instantly imagine this scenario where they are getting on great and have awesome sex. But I don't have that security even if I feel comfortable with one guy I am seeing right now.

I've come close and I think the recurring pattern I've experienced is to just go for i, if I see a cute guy, because I am not getting any younger. I don't know exactly what I want either between sex or a relationship. 

I just need help with work, my personal life and relationships. I've been able to move on from a guy I saw last year but I still get paranoid thoughts about other people fucking all the time. Even if they aren't. My brain is fucked up...

Many thanks",24Oct2018,1
