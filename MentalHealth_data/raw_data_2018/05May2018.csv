1,I just got out of a 3 week stay at a hospital which was such utter shit and I already feel like killing myself again. My hallucinations are driving me to want to scoop my eyes out. I also still want to cut off my finger and I'm getting more and more closer to doing it because i feel like I'm being possessed and controlled. Earlier today I kept thinking in such detail of it crawling out of my chest and the bone and flesh breaking and moving way for it and I started crying. I've only been getting worse and feel like I need to get rid of it through my blood... But I've just hit such despair from seeing shit all my life and how worse it's gotten these past 4 months. I just want to get away from everyone and hide i just don't find a point.,05May2018,2,
2,"I wanna start this off by saying, NO I do not plan on buying a gun, but I'm just curious... If someone tries to buy a gun and you get a background check done, what shows up in terms of mental health? Or even, not regarding the purchase of a gun, and just a plain old back ground check? I have voluntarily gone to the ER several times and voluntarily been in partial hospitalization intensive therapy where I go to therapy 5 days a week (paid for by health insurance). 

Does anyone just have the ability to run a background check, with my consent of course, and see that I have been through those things?

I tried to do some googling and I couldn't really find the answer to what I'm asking.",05May2018,1,

Last night my boyfriend and I went shopping for pillows and I left the store spending $50 on misc stuff. I tend to get the urge to go shopping and will spend money I don't have. It sucks because I can't just talk myself out of it. I have this feeling that I NEED to do something once my mind starts going on it. Like now my job. Maybe it's nothing. I can't fully explain it. It probably sounds very minor. ",05May2018,1,

6,"I'm an 18, soon to be 19 male living in the UK and to be honest I've had a pretty good life. About this time last year my life had seemed like it had peaked, sure I'd been getting thoughts that put me down and I'd always had self esteem issues but I had been studying my AS levels which was the best school year I'd ever had since the subjects were my choice and I loved them all (English Lit was my favourite). At the start of 2017 I had made some new friends and had gotten really close with a girl from on of my classes and we were talking like all day every day. I'll spare you the details but after a couple of months I finally worked up the courage to ask her out and she felt the same way. My life had really peaked. Since I had never really been in a relationship before and I was head of heels for her I was constantly freaking out and being anxious about what to do, how to act etc. She was really good to me but with the stress of not knowing what to do, being a natural worrier, and with my exams coming closer and closer I got sent into this really bad spiral of thinking and acting. From 2016 to March 2017 I had really only had one depressive episode but after that they practically became daily since was just a living ball of stress. I was still head over heels for this girl but I kept doubting how she felt about me. Any money I had I would pour into her, she was perfect to me and told her that (cringy I know but I didn't know what else to say). We were really only dating for a month and a bit before I majorly screwed up. After practically having a depressive episode every day I decided to try and get some help, I went to see a GP, a private psychologist and then a State funded one. For the first while it was alright but then I hit rock bottom one day. See, every Saturday me and the GF would hang out and watch movies and have dinner together and it was great but after it was over it just wasn't the same cause she wasn't there. After this feeling had been there for a while I became really evasive, when I text her it didn't make sense and instead of telling her anything I wrote a massive word document about how I felt. I thought she hated me for who I was, for how I was and I told her if she wanted to leave me that was okay. That was the it for her, next day she broke up with me. We remained friends for a few weeks before I just stopped going to school and stopped talking to her, I deleted Facebook, blocked her number etc but I knew she wasn't going to message me. I'd just spent days not doing anything but lying in bed and crying cause as soon as she was gone I knew how bad I'd messed up. My friends were quite supportive, asking why I wasn't in school and even offering to take me out but I just pushed them away and stayed alone. The whole summer I didn't really go out except for once on my friends birthday and then a few days after. I was thinking of leaving the school I was at, maybe education altogether and just working the rest of my life, probably moving to another country. When it hit September I decided to stay at my school but I ended up dropping the subject I shared with my now ex, English Lit. My friends and psych told me that time and space would do wonders but as soon as I saw her again for the first time in 3 months all the feelings came flooding back, I would just avoid her, I couldn't even deal with hearing her voice. For a little while it got better. I could go to school, do my classes and go home fine but more recently it's gotten so much harder. In the last 3 weeks of school I've attended under half the days. Its been almost a year and she's still on my mind. Whenever I'm trying to think of names of researchers for psychology her name always pops in. No matter I'm doing if it's playing games, talking to friends, driving or working I always manage to think about her or the time I spent with her and I makes he cringe so bad and curse myself. From an objective point of view my lift has gotten better I guess. I learned to drive after failing my test 3 times, got good as level results, got a good job and such but I just get this feeling that my life isnt gonna get any better. My aspiration is to go do Law but I'm second guessing everything. I don't think I'm good enough for it, I keep thinking that I'll get fired when I go into work, that I'll fail all my exams and that I'll be alone forever. I'm disgusted with myself and I have no motivation for anything. All I do is wallow in self pity and I hate it but there's nothing I feel like I can do at this point. I'm just a waster. Nobodies even gonna read this or give a shit, I just wanna say it all. The only thing that gets me to work now is stress.

TL;DR I'm a mess of a person, a waster with nowhere to go so here's my cringy life story. Can't wait to find myself on cringe or some other subreddit. ",05May2018,1,
7,"I don’t know if my ADHD has any relation to this but I have this weird sensitivity to certain things.  It’s hard to explain, for example: if I’m sleeping and someone’s making the slightest bit of noise, I’ll become wide awake and unable to shift my focus on anything else and I won’t even attempt sleeping until the noise is gone. Or if I’m trying to write a text or an exam, the slightest bit of noise completely makes my brain disregard what I’m doing until that sound is gone. It’s like my mind shifts all of its attention to specific annoyances (commonly sound), and tortures me, causing mood and energy shifts. There’s different sounds that trigger it, and it’s not only limited to sounds. This is especially relevant when I’m under pressure to achieve a goal such as writing a test or falling asleep. If this happens while I’m writing a test, my ability to comprehend sentences and maintain focus diminishes very significantly to the point where I get anxious and fidgety and I’m mentally unable to complete the test. Or if I’m trying to get some sleep I become wide awake despite how tired I am throughout the day. Idk what this is but it greatly affects my everyday life and I’d appreciate any feedback and suggestions, thanks!",05May2018,1,
8,"Maybe this doesn't fit here, I don't know. My friend died yesterday in his 30s and I feel so fucking shit. We had fallen out a long time ago and I feel so guilty, we didn't speak for a couple of years.",05May2018,1,
9,"A long background story before I ask the questions
(malaysia)

When I was 5-12, I usually get beaten by my mother and sometimes my father.

The reasons usually will be that i am intellectually slow and stupid.
How stupid? I can't read and can't spell cant even properly construct proper sentences and my grades is a joke. other times was usually due to bad behavior

Not only that, my mom have the nice idea to shame me in front of her friends, relatives and even my friends. from my academics, to looks, desires, and a certain body part of mine.

then around the age of 13-15 my parents had a fight. It was about me, I heard they said my name. Then they divorced afterwards, I used to blame my self. But I don't anymore. after that, it was spiraling down wards. I envied my brother so much, he was better at everything, He didn't even get hit by my parents. If he wanted something he'll get it anyways. If I wanted something I'll be called ""stupid"" and ""you worth nothing""

school life was pretty normal. I think, never had a gf during school. sometimes I break down emotionally. My parents financial status was never a problem, We had food on our plates, Stainless steel spoon/forks. 

what was not considered normal during my school years is that, I became atheist.

fast forward to my 20's. I had a job, resigned because I had to take diploma, got a gf then broke up (we were together since 19-24). I had to stop pursuing my diploma during my internship (or my sixth semester), because my ""depression"" was getting out of hands. Episodes of Extreme sadness, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, with a mix of moral dilemma's and sometimes multiple inner voices. Like 3 of them in my head that bicker back and forth.

Now I am 25. I got diagnosed with ""dysthimia"" doctors say it was a type of depression  that lasted longer than normal. With usually a mild depression. I was diagnosed on september 2017 if I remember correctly.

Nowadays. I don't really know what or how I feel. Sometimes when I think back, I do recall on happy memories, but they are.. Muddied or blurred and sometimes hard to remember. During sleepless night or in deep thought. I can fully recall when I was hit, where and how I was hit.

I don't think I have depression, sometimes I think I made up the story. I don't really know anymore. sometimes I just want to die but I don't want to in the same time. Other times, I think... I am already dead and this is my purgatory.

So.. the questions is.. Is this depression? Is this what it feels like? Was I really abused, if I can recall the memories vividly?

And why do I feel that I made up the story. Maybe my parents did love me.
Because. If they dont, Why am I fat? My stomach is always full, I have a PC that can play games that I want. I have a bed, a roof on my head and pocket money when I want it. Maybe I am just a spoiled child, rotten to the core and manipulative with my sob stories.

but thats just about it. I just can't tell, what is real and whats not anymore. my life was constructed on my lie and my own perspective of the world anyways.

11,"Alright so im gonna tell you my horrible expierence with things that might be OCD as i found out today. Please read this i really need advice on what to do. Whenever i was really young i was super afraid of everything and extremly afraid of the dark, even laying next to my mom and dad, i always saw the curtains moving which made me terrified. And it was also dark which made me extra scared and made me cry all the time, here comes some extreme stuff: so i was always 3 years old when i slept in my parents room. One time laying between my parents i could already talk pretty well, but suddenly my voice was gone and i couldn't talk, as the curtains closed in on me i tried to scream louder and louder, i also was afraid of someone that kept killing me in my sleep (i was 3 at the time) was gonna kill me, legit im nog joking. Then when me voice was back i screamed for help and my parents heard it and woke up. I had this for quite a long time, me and my brother used to share a room together when we were still young and at this time i was too afraid to walk out of my bed while my brother was still laying in bed, i also was afraid to walk around the house, thinking some creature would kill me. This creature in my dreams was totally black and a bit unclear to see. When i got my own room i always hid myself under the blankets to hide myself making up beliefs that my blanket has this shield around it that they can't touch me and that i can't see this. This has become a habit, i still do it now and whenever im sleeping and my mom pulls away my blanket off my head, i automaticly pull it over my head again. Now that i'm almost 13 years old this creature in my dreams disappeard and the fear of everything has greatly disappeard but i still hide myself from the dark and sometimes i get these kind off fear attacks that make me scared of everything around me. It only happens when something i find scary triggers it. But when i am afraid i extremly exagerate it thinking something is gonna bite my head off or something. Any sudden sound scares me a bit depending on how loud it is, if it's loud i get that fear attack i told you about. I also have crazy thoughts of me or someone hurting me or me hurting someone, also some crazy thoughts as me raping another person. What i'm about to say may look crazy, but a year back my dad and sister were joking around and could talk well to eachother, thoughts came up i didnt want to think, so i ignored it for the time being. Some time later we were walking and my sister had to do something so my dad waited next to her, we went quite a bit ahead and they were behind a building. My mind suddenly thought they were making out and my dad touching my sisters boobs and stuff, i DON'T WANT TO THINK OF THESE THINGS. I even started believing they were really fucking eachother and having a secret relation with eachother. This hurts me so much. This thing has been gone for the most part but i still sometimes think they are kissing when for example my sister goes to the toilet and my dad also wanted to go at the same time. This time i can ignore it pretty well. I also think that if a random thought comes up like, i love satan. (I really don't) but that satan comes to me and does something to me (im even freaking out and scared right now typing this) or when i see google earth and zoom out untill i see the whole planet my mind makes up that i have the power to control the universe and suddenly it sends a planet hitting earth. I freak out thinking this will happen so i say REVERSE or GO BACK and then believing it wont happen, basically a go back button. I even set up this thing so that i only can get this power back once i kick and punch my closet and the same time. I am also a CLEAN freak of things around me. If it belongs to me, or is mine. That is isn't dirty since my bacterië (dont know whats it in english) is on it, with others on the other hand i am a total clean freak. These things have been making my life a mess, and i'm too scared to tell anyone besides my best friends. I wanna know what you guys think of this and if i have a mental illness. PLEASE HELP.

15,"Hi, I'm having difficulty googling this. Over the past several years with increasing frequency over the past several months I've been having ""episodes"" in which I get incredibly angry and fixated on some minor thing...

About two years ago I BLEW UP at my father for making a very ignorant comment about a traumatic incident with my mother. It was gross but I still blew it way out of proportion. Lot's of pent up frustration towards him. It took me two days to calm down.

About a year ago I BLEW UP at my sister for basically nothing but I had a lot of pent up frustration towards her. I could not calm down or listen to reason for several hours. 

Now in the span of two weeks I've blown up at my partner twice after getting fixated on a relatively minor incident. With pent up frustration towards the issue but not them as a person or the relationship. 

It's not just pent up frustration but more of a psycho rage that is very distressing to the people involved, and myself. I get extremely worked up over a minor issue and turn it into a massive deal. I say all sorts of awful things and act like this is the end of the world and the relationship. ",05May2018,1,
16,"Hi, current internet user who's dealt with mental illness, still constantly do, and understand the struggle of illness all too well. I will be keeping sexes/names anonymous, and I will have to delete this later in fears that my friend will find out.

I've had a friend for the last few years which I have been really close to. We've done everything from travel together to pursuing artistic endeavors. This friend has always been a social person, but deep down they have had fairly bad anxiety issues, usually manifested in them avoiding responsibility and other people. This is not something that they entirely do on purpose, but it has been the reason for conflict between them and others in the past.

This is especially important, because their avoidance has worsened. My friend owns a company engaging in artistic endeavors, which requires collaborative engagement from many people, as close to anywhere from 10-100 at a time. This has been a big downfall in their company's decline, as they have consistently worsened in terms of anxiety/avoidance, to the point of shutting themselves off from contact.

Their depression and anxiety has risen to crippling levels, and it was especially triggered by a highly abusive relationship. This person has knocked them down and attacked the worst of my friend's insecurities. This lasted a couple of months, and to my knowledge, it has been put on standby for a bit now. However, the experience has left them broken, and they are unable to work on any level of productive work, essentially avoiding responsibilities, losing money and trust from others around them. In fact, there have been many instances in which they have unfortunately been called out for their lack of action, and it has manifested to the point in which they believe that no one cares about them.

This worsens as my friend has also had several health issues over their lifetime. They aren't old by any means, but they have had more and more health issues arise which they struggle with consistently. They also have a history of cancer from a younger age, which has unfortunately returned. 

When they are confronted by issues regarding their company, they apologize and take blame, but put a condition on the reason why they have not upheld their side of the bargain. Recently, they have shown signs of try to work though issues, but unfortunately after a few messages, they continue to essentially unload their struggles on the other person, typically leaving them very uncomfortable and unsure of what to do.

My heart goes out to my friend, as I can't explain how much they must be going through. However, the depression and anxiety they face leaves them stuck inside their home constantly, initiating almost no contact with anyone, and ignoring any attempt at contact. When I am able to contact them, they are consistently talking about how they have decided to die and stop treatment for most of their illness. Due to their mistake, they believe that everyone has stopped caring or believing in them, and that they simply deserve to die alone.

They also believe that, although massive chances of surviving their cancer, will die from it. Although the odds are stacked in their favor, they have avoided talking to their family about the situation, choosing to avoid treatment at all costs as a form of self harm. Unfortunately, I have been a part of their business and actually ow a lot of my own business progress from it, which I am very thankful for. However, I have been left very frustrated over the few years working with them, and realized that unfortunately, it was not a healthy relationship. I continue to be their friend, and consistently offer (alongside others) to help them, so that they can get back on their feet quicker. However, my friend outright avoids getting help most of the time, and seems to rather go down on their own, continuing to leave situations unsolved, until they backlash and they have lost money, trust and reputation from the situation.

It's complex, and it's something that I unfortunately have tried to help my friend with, above and beyond. I've paid flights to go out and see them as we live far away, I have been a manager of their company at one point, and offer to help them out still whenever they need it. Although my friend never takes my help, I always let them know that I'm always here for them if they need it, and all they have to do is give me a ring. 

In short of the situation, They have tried to commit suicide multiple times before, were forced into a hospital, and have had traumatic experiences because of it. Even before this experience, they decided that they did not want to seek any therapy or any form of mental help, and continues to ignore any suggestions of help.

I'm at my wits end, and although I care deeply about them, I realize there is only so much I can do on my end. They've been a really close friend to me, and these warning signs are something I cannot ignore further. On top of this, they have begun to explain how they intend on killing themselves to others who are uninvolved in my friend's situation. They refuse to put their company on hiatus, and outright ignore just about any advice to take care of their health. They don't believe that what they are doing is hurting them further, even though I have tried many times to do so. Although they were always avoidant, their personality has taken a true 180, and they used to listen and had the ability to hold very rational conversations. My friend is basically in a downhill spiral, and I told myself that I would have to put matters into my own hands if nothing were to come out of it, because I don't see anyone else doing anything. 

Since they're one of my best friends, I would truly be decimated if something happened. I would blame myself for it, and for not taking action when I could have. They have always kept their life away from their family, and since moving out have not really contacted them much. I am highly, highly aware that my actions can mark the end of my friendship with them. Although this hurts, I am willing to take this risk, for their life is more important than my friendship with them. I decided that if I truly did not see any signs of them improving or trying to improve their wellbeing, that I would contact my friend's family, as it is the only thing that I can think of doing that could save them from what they've set their mind on. 

Please keep in mind that my friend's family consists of their mother and father. Their father would be a better bet to talk to, as my friends mother is very emotional, and would not be able to handle a clear conversation about the matter. My friend's father is a very busy person as he has his own company, and is very ""cut-to-the-chase."" However, I would like to gather screenshots of our talks with evidence of his mental spiraling (in the event their father may try to discount my friend's issues), and form a chronological summary of what has happened, why I contacted my friend's dad, and explaining that I only care about the wellbeing of my friend. Therefore, whether my friend hurts themself or not, I can rest somewhat easy knowing that I tried to do something to stop themselves from ending it all.

I guess after all of that context, my question is: I have around a full day to gather information, and I'd like to be as prepared as possible to clearly articulate the severity of the situation, and informing my friend's father on my friend's state, so that their family can help them.

How could I formulate the introductory message to send my friend's dad? I want to tell their dad that I would like to talk tomorrow, and bring about a sense of urgency that it is about my friend. However, I want to make sure that I don't worry my friend's dad too much, so that he doesn't have a restless night and nonfunctional day tomorrow, worried about their kid until the call. How can I bring about a sense of urgency, without scaring my friend's dad? Thanks in advance, and sorry for the long post. Godspeed to all of you!",05May2018,1,

30,"I can’t stand my looks- specifically my big nose and forehead. I don’t like looking at pictures of myself. I also don’t like looking in mirrors but I do it anyways because I have a strange need to look into them and check if I’m still ugly, which I always am. . I feel so self absorbed for having to stare at myself every time I see my reflection. 

My looks cause me to be very self conscious and affect my work ethic when I see attractive people in public. I’m so inferior to them. On multiple occasions I have started crying after seeing a group of attractive people come into my work. I don’t want any of them to look at me.

I’ve considered getting plastic surgery on my nose but I’m scared and I don’t have the money. I’m also afraid that I’ll get it done but still hate it. 

I’ve also though about just killing myself so I don’t have to look at my stupid face ever again. I feel so ashamed that other people have to see me. I hate being alive so much that even eating seems like a chore, I used to enjoy it but now it’s useless. It seems like so much work to have to eat 3 meals a day when I don’t even want to be here in the first place. 

I’m an 18 year old girl, and besides going to a children’s therapist for two weeks when I was 13 for suicidal thoughts, I haven’t seen anyone for this. I was never diagnosed with anything. How do I even start the steps to get diagnosed? Is there a way to bring up my concerns without sounding like I’m self diagnosing or making it up? I don’t know how often people do that, but I don’t want to be like that. I just want answers.

31,"Hello!
For the past 4 months something really odd has been happening to me. I don’t know how to put it really but I feel hollow and like I’m not myself. I researched what it may be, and I found that it may be depersonalisation but most of the things say you should feel like in a dream or like a robot but I don’t. I just feel like I’m out of control of my body and that I’m hollow. It didn’t start off bad, it would happen now and then and it confused me, but now it’s got to the point where I feel permanently hollow, and sometimes when it gets really bad I can forget who I am where I am why I’m there or any combination of them. Another thing that’s showing up is anxiety. I have developed a really bad stage fright, to the point that I will be twitching and sweating and sometimes I will just not be able to take it so I literally break down in tears on the floor and I tremble heavily. The anxiety doesn’t stop there though. When I speak to people I also twitch my fingers or bend them back heavily to the point where it hurts. I can also feel like my lungs are becoming really pressurised. 
If anyone knows anything please tell me I really need to know what this is

33,"I’m a socially unfit retard who should have never been born. Just under 40 minutes ago I got terminated from a position(on call staffing security) for the most pitiful and easily avoidable thing imaginable. I just hired for this job not too long ago and this my third shift. This man was carrying a heavy crate up the stairs, he dropped it whilst bringing it through the door and was livid that I did not assist him whilst I tried to afterwards, but too little too late. He complained and the team at the location had me removed. I had been standing there for 6 hours watching over a maintenance stairway, I was too much of a dazed dolt to notice or be courteous. I’m socially retarded by nature. Thats the only damn social contact the job requires. The coordinator said he would repost me somewhere else, but I know I’m likely done(that’s one thing I seem to know with certainly). Anyways, it’s utterly comical. My entire life, this is all their is, hampered by my own inferiority. You know that same saying, one step forward, multiple, irreparable steps back.

Ridiculous, fucking ridiculous, but expected, so expected, my god. Easiest fucking job in the world, standing for a few hours, damn near 100% hire rate and I fuck that up.

I didn’t know my apathy and dissociation could reach a lower depth. In fact I’m at the Las Vegas Strip, there’s multiple ways I could end it right now. I could jump off a hotel, into traffic or provoke a cop into shooting me. I don’t know, you can just laugh. Defective nothings like me should have never left the womb.

35,"Ive said this in some other places but no one has real answers. I like hurting people. Physically or mentally doesn't matter. Just the feeling of knowing ""I have bested you"" bring indescribable pleasure.

I was a rough sort of kid who often got into fights. Only around 8th grade or so did I finally begin to settle down after a run in with police. I tell most people its because I didnt want to hurt people any more (I have a lot of people who keep tabs on me I need to lie to). Load of horseshit though. Nothing feels better than that moment when the other person realizes they cant stop you. Or when a generally composed person finally cracks and screams/hits back.

After pulling myself back all of it ended up manifesting differently with me going on 30min-1hour long tears through my surroundings shouting at anyone and breaking as much shit as I could. Eventually the government forced me to attend a boarding school for messed up kids where I only got worse over time. 

After leaving that place I was relatively stable for a couple years. Today I'm 22 and its reaching a point where I cant contain it anymore. I still live with my folks. They move around a lot and I'm currently living in the middle of fucking nowhere. I cant get a job, I cant go to school, I don't have the money to leave this awful dust-bowl and I have nowhere to go even if I did.

I have no friends from my childhood. In the last year Ive found people online I talk to regularly but it isnt the same as real life. People can just mute or block you online. I cant force people to confront me.

And so when I have no one and nothing to direct it all toward I turn it on myself. If I go out with a nice bang at least people will be forced to deal with me. I can relish that pain.",05May2018,1,

39,"So I have a couple standing diagnoses (PTSD, Panic Disorder/GAD) that had been mostly under control (read: my husband and I were desperately trying to figure out a way to access mental health that worked with my school + work schedule) and then my husband died, very suddenly. And that ""mostly under control, but not really"" spiralled into ""not under control.""

However! I may be mentally ill but I am a mentally ill social worker! I know what to do. I had to switch insurances, because I was insured under my husband. I temporarily withdrew from school. My GP immediately started me on Zoloft and helped connect me to a therapist who takes my insurance. 

However, I have desperately been trying to find a psychiatrist. I rage quit psychiatry around the same time my husband and I went from ""You're a hot hook up"" to ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you"" so it's been a while. The reason I quit was because we cycled through the meds available to me (I'm medically complicated) and the doctor finally decided the only thing for me was exposure therapy. Which inevitably led me going home to my apartment, crying and retraumatized. So I quit.

I tried going back to the same psychiatric clinic (it's with the same hospital all of my specialists are at). I've been calling since January and they're still not accepting patients. I called my insurance company to get connected to someone. They found two clinics accepting patients - one I would have to go in weekly and the latest appointment of the day is 2:30, across the city from my job, meaning that I would need to take a half day of PTO every week which I can't do, and one that said they would not use my appropriate name or gender pronouns (I'm transgender).

Frustrated beyond belief, I called my insurance's nursing hotline to be like, ""WTF am I supposed to do? I desperately need help and I'm really upset."" We went over my symptoms at the time (I wanted to cry, I had a high heart rate) and he was basically like, ""Go the ER. You're having a panic attack [I wasn't, I was literally just frustrated] and they'll treat you at the ER.""

A) This seems like a gross overuse of the Emergency Room for what is obviously not an emergency situation. Having worked in an ER before, I know the frustration of using an ER for non emergency situations and it's abuse of the system to say ""This isn't an emergency but this will give me access to a hospital social worker.""

B) Shortly after my husband died, I did try to go to the ER because I was living on my own, my husband had just died, and I had zero resources. (This is before therapy etc) The ER sent me to a different place around the corner, specifically for psych. They, too, refused to use the right name or pronouns. They took all of my jewelry, including my wedding and engagement rings. I wasn't allow books, phone, or any entertainment of any kind. They had a television on some kind of reality show, but on mute. I wasn't allowed to wear a hat or my sweater and the place was freezing. I waited for over four hours to be seen (there was one other person in the clinic/ER) and by the time hour four hit, I would have said literally anything to get out of there. When I said what I had to do to not be admitted (they wanted to admit me ""for an undetermined amount of time, until you get better"" and ""a social worker will be in charge of handling your job and notifying your landlord"" and ""we want you in patient to rapidly tritrate you on several medications at once"" - these are all terrifying statements) I left like they set my feet on fire.

I am 28 year old male with a you can say nice job and I have an ambition for a caree change, but I am scared I will eventually waste my life. I am afraid there is not turning back for me.

We've been in a long distance relationship for 8 months and I'm starting to losing hope in our relationship, she has BPD (Borderline personality disorder), depression and bad anxiety at times due to bad past relationships and terrible things she's experienced at a young age. She doesn't like me doing certain things like watching TWD with my family because it apparently had a scene that showed a female being taken advantage of back in one of the seasons (cant remember which or if it even happened) because her anxiety acts up really bad to the point where she would self harm and even talk about ending her own life. I also worked with a large group of people for over 2 years creating maps and content on a game which I really enjoyed doing and it helped motivate me to start animating, being more creative and being more social, but she started feeling insecure because there were two females on the team that a barely talked to (and if we did it was only related to the project). She didn't like me talking to other females (which raised a red flag in my head) and even some other guys who were also on the team that she didn't get along with. I feel like shes controlling me in a way telling me what I should and shouldn't be doing and who I shouldn't be talking to and I don't like it. I stopped watching the show with my family (Which made them upset because it was something we always did) and I quit the team so her anxiety wouldn't be so bad and I could try to help her with her issues. I got her to start going to therapy and also see a physiatrist because we both agreed her problems were serious and I want her to get better and hopefully have a better relationship. I talk with her everyday through either text or phone call and do my best when she gets anxiety or gets upset and usually I'm able to calm her just by talking and telling her shes going to be alright and breath or even watching family movies on Netflix with her like How to train your dragon or Finding Dory which usually works really well and she becomes her usual, cheerful self again. I talked with very few people about her and her behavior and most people say to leave her because its too much stress on me and that she could be unpredictable because she could be alright one minute and suddenly turn on me the next, another person said not to give up on her and to keep trying, I really love her to death and care for her but I don't want to leave her.

 I'm starting to become uncertain and feel like I'm making things worse and we've been getting into more conflicts recently. She tells me shes never had a BF that treats her as kindly as I do and understands how hard I'm trying for her even when I'm new to relationships and all. She told me she is afraid to lose me as well because of how unstable our relationship has gotten and always tells me how sorry she is because of how ""broken"" she is. I'm afraid things will get worse if this keeps going on and if I leave her that she might try something like trying to self harm or worse. (I already called the cops on her once because she was telling me she was going to end her life and her mother ended up taking her to the hospital for the night until she was better) I really want to be able to do the things I enjoy again and I would like to work with my team again but when I mention it she explodes and tells me how I must prefer the game team over her when that's not the case, she was always my priority. In the end its giving me horrible headaches like I've never experienced before and now I'm afraid for my own health.

Over the years I learned not to trust anyone. My parents, friends and even the counselors at my school. I think it's because when I was younger I used to cry a lot, but I was made fun of for it so I learned how to suppress and burry my feelings. And even if it was someone that I would trust I still wouldn't say anything. I don't know why I have such a problem talking about my feelings. I really didn't know I was doing that until one of my speech coaches told me I wasn't good at expressing the hurt or sad emotion. At face value I'm a pretty charismatic person and sometimes people call me funny. I don't have social anxiety or anything it's just nobody besides my parents honestly gives a shit about me. I just hope that the next mental breakdown that I have won't be explosive. One of the side affects of sealing your feelings is once in a while the seal breaks and you cannot control.

Engaged to a woman with not sure what, maybe bipolar, or extreme anxiety, doctors' diagnoses were kinda just ""huh...maybe this...here's meds, hope they work"" a few years ago when we took her in. The variety of drugs they tried made her wicked sick and she went off, and it was hard to consistently get her help because affordable mental health in our area isn't easy without great insurance.

Fast forward to now, she's almost daily on the verge of breaking down, considering suicide, getting her in to the affordable clinic is at minimum a 1 month wait (and even then there's a good chance the day of her appointment the doc will cancel and reschedule another month out...happened to her several times before).
 Committing her again would plunge us even more into debt and she'd lose her job and we wouldn't be able to make rent, which would basically give her even more to worry about when she comes back out and defeat the purpose of her going in in the first place. Maybe she could try to find a job where she doesn't have to deal with shitty customers or works from the house, but she didn't finish college and who knows how long that will take to find. 

I'm at a fucking loss of what to do. Every solution I come up with just seems horrible.

For the first time in our 5 years together I've reached the point where I don't know if I see a future with her, but if I leave she'd be completely fucked and I love her far too much to do that. I feel like a horrible person for thinking that, but we both thought she would have made strides forward by now.

I have to ask, because it’s truly worrisome and it seems to affect my personal relationships critically and my mental health drastically. I want to know if anyone else feels the same way I’m about to describe and if you have any ways to cope when you feel this way? (If you ever feel this way)

So here I go. I get these gigantic waves of what it seems to be anxiety attacks. They last for varying times and only happen usually in well spaced days but sometimes in multiple day bursts. I’m have a complete loss of energy, I feel as if I cannot move and I also feel like I’m performing for everyone. I have these introspective thoughts that drive me mad. What I mean by that is that I listen to people talk and my mind seems to automatically pick a word at random to listen for. If I hear it, I am bum rushed with a major wave of coldness in my chest and fear in my heart. It sounds so over dramatic writing it. I constantly feel like there are eyes on me. Even when I’m alone. When I speak to people I can hear myself, I can assess the words as they come out of my mouth. I also feel like I can see myself sitting from across the room talking and it’s me, the real me. I see myself saying the things that I mean to say but the intention is all wrong. The motive is misinterpreted by myself. I then convince myself through my own hypothetical thought that I think the other person is thinking which is typically “He’s dreaming in his head, there must be big thoughts in there” to pull myself through. If you are confused, believe me, I am too. I feel like I have three different people living in my head but they are just shells of me. They don’t have there own voices, they act as masks that grapple themselves onto me, without any permission at all. I watch them and wait for them to do so. I get comfortable and turn my back for one moment and then they latch on. As soon as they are on l, I’m banished from head, pushed to back. I’m watching the conveyer belt of words flowing to my mouth. I cringe and look away when I see what is coming. It’s never bad though, a little awkward, but that’s just me. That’s at least what others say when I ask them if I was acting odd. That’s even the weirder thing, I seem to be the one that only notices but at the same time I’m not because it totally affects the attitude of others. I also do this thing where I seem to lie to myself and hide behind things to prove to myself that I’m different than these fake faces. For example, I have a dick pic on my profile because one night I thought that I could make myself feel like me if I exposed myself. Unfortunately it did not work and now my profile is just depression and wiener world.

About a month into her being home from work \(her doctor recommended taking a month off\) and she was doing fine, a week later and she went back to work but was straight up fired after lashing out at her manager \(she's typically a well mannered and professional woman, never letting anger get inbetween her and her work, but she was already starting to change.\) A few weeks after that and she's started getting into spirituality, heavily, heavily into spirituality and took a trip to a local psychic where he told she was essentially the same as him \- this kicked everything into overdrive, she started talking about seeing the future, talking about weird shit like ""star seeds"" and good and dark energy, I had to call the cops because she would get into these conversations about missing children and then fuckin collapse, telling me all these random stories about what really happened when a quick google search shows that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happened to the child, not \(insert whatever she thinks.\) It got to the breaking point today when she woke me up at 3:30am talking about the rapture and how I need to believe her, she went into the backyard and started screaming/ crying at ""God"" so I told her she was scaring the next door kids and she needed to come inside, she started going off on how I needed to believe her, the rapture was coming and there's good and evil people that can and can't come to heaven. I called my grandma to ask if she could come pick her up and bring her to the hospital and she started attacking me thinking I was talking to someone else, I showed her the caller ID and it wasn't enough, she said she'd calm down if she could use my phone for a second \(i reluctantly agreed, just wanting her to stop and calm down\) and then she tried to smash it \(""for your own good, these people are trying to hurt you""\)

I've called the police 3 times now, and each time they've sent an ambulance and a nurse to talk with her, and she'll go full blown psycho rapture lady on them but talks them out of doing anything for her EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. She's in the backyard screaming at god but because she's cooperative in the hospital they think she's doing it for attention. I can't put up with this anymore, I watched my mom go from a nice loving hard working woman to some monster awake at 4am plotting on how to save the world from destruction. She's lost all of her friends because of this, she's pushed away most of her family, and to top it all off, she \(and me\) are getting evicted because of her crazy ideas. I'm at my wits end.",05May2018,2,
60,"I'm not depressed or in danger of self-harm or any of the usual issues that I'm seeing in my brief scan of this subreddit, however, I am having an issue with my thoughts.  

It feels as if my brain is beginning to turn to stone and the solidification is eating away at my brains ability to think, receive, and retain information.  It's more than a cloud or a blanket.  It ""feels"" like concrete is being poured and is slowly turning everything inside to hard mineral. 

Even just now I've been stopped in my tracks in writing this because I lose the thoughts I began with and have to start anew, towards the thoughts end, and fill in the spots in between with guesswork.  

I've no idea what is going on.  I was an avid writer, reader, musician, and now anytime I get a near such a thing my brain cannot continue and my mind refuses to work.  I'm in my twenties so unless I have a tumor I don't think it's something actually happening in my physical brain.  I guess not anyways.",05May2018,1,
