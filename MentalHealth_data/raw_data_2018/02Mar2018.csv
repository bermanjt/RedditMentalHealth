0,"Hey guys and gals, I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar. So I decided to make a YouTube channel dedicated to helping End the Stigma on Mental health. I'm new here and just wanted to say I have some videos about my life with Bipolar along with some informative mental health ones too. I'm hoping these videos reach people that really need it. There's a lot more to come in the future. Thanks! check it out : https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCOxg3VI4OIV6cwGLAZcnDBg",02Mar2018,14,
1,"My mom is far from perfect...

She is manipulative and a liar, but she is my mom and i love her.
This evening i came home from my dad and i had a bit of an argument with my mother, nothing big(we've had worse) and only verbal. 

My mom used to make a point of apologizing or at least settling things before going to sleep or leaving. She told me that she fears that if we don't and something bad happends our last interaction would've been a negative one.

She also always and i mean always says goodnight to me even when i am asleep. Tonight after our argument (around 9:30ish) we didn't speak to eachother for the rest of the evening (sort of a common thing). But tonight was different.

She didn't tell me goodnight and I don't know why, but it is bothering me a lot...

Any advice/helpful words?
Thank you guys in advance.

2,"I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for almost 3 years, and now I feel like I got hit in the head. I can hardly remember anything. I pushed the memories of the emotional abusive relationship out of my head as a defense mechanism. 
What I am wondering is, has anyone else experienced this? Do your memories eventually come back?
I used to be able to have flowing conversations with people by telling them stories about my life and they would relate back to my stories, now I struggle having conversations with people because of the memory loss and I hate it. I just want to be myself again. ",02Mar2018,4,
3,"(Really really sorry for the long post)

Me and my SO (Both of us live in England) have reached a point with her mental health where we don't think any progress can be made unless she receives professional help. The list below is most of her symptoms (she dictated most of this to me): 

* General stress that she can’t control, whether it be because of an actual reason or just out of nowhere.
* Feelings of anxiety with no cause for stretches of days at a time, non-stop fluttery heart, “felt like a non-stop heart attack”. 
* Split levels of control in the brain, with varying levels of agency i.e. feels as if she sometimes has a primary “brain”, this one is mostly in control during normal activity, but auxiliary brains “murmur” during this constantly, although she is mostly able to ignore it. Auxiliary brains normally take the fore when she has nothing to occupy the primary (although sometimes this is random). The types of “brains” is as follows: One that is generally derogatory to her, attacks her value, worth, and her competence, one that “shouts” apparently random phrases that seem specific to agitate and “freak out” her the most i.e. lots of religious things even though she is very nonreligious. One that she feels, when it is in effect, tries to influence her behavior to achieve desirable outcomes (the crux of this being that this feels like a separate entity that is externally trying to get her to do things she knows to be manipulative). One that used to be more prominent when she was younger, wherein it compels her to complete menial actions or to fulfill vague criteria to avoid negative (and often very transient) consequences, which most of the time meant death (i.e. she mentioned during primary school assemblies she would “try and fill up a box in my head with the words in the assembly and if they didn’t exactly fit the box I believed I would die.”). Should be noted, that all the auxiliary brains can at times, with or without cause, assume the position of primary brain.
* Lack of motivation, particularly towards things she actually enjoys doing. Has begun to affect her hygiene. This compounds on her already negative feelings as it shuts her out from things that she could use to feel better i.e. her hobbies, because she feels no motivation to actually carry any of it out even though she knows she enjoys them. She thinks this might be linked to general exhaustion. 
* Somethings she describes as a kind of fog that randomly appears and disappears that in her words “makes my brain hard to navigate.” Has no control over this. Thinks this may be related to general exhaustion.  
* Sometimes her perception of time passage either speeds up or slows down drastically. This appears to be random.
* In regard to conversation, she feels as if “everyone was given a script at birth, and I wasn’t, so I just have to take conversation skills from other people.” By this she means she takes individual phrases she hears from other people and applies them specifically to certain situations. She is conscious of conversations after the fact, but cannot follow them clearly during them. Feels as if she “parrots” conversation a lot, not that she actually is participating in or understanding the conversation. 
* Constantly worries that she doesn’t actually have any mental illness because, to her, that would mean she herself is just a person who doesn’t work well and that nothing could ever be done to help her.  
* Has constant nightmares that compound the exhaustion she feels. She is not able to separate the nightmares from reality very quickly, so she is normally very emotionally affected by these. 
* Has no access to actual support as the help her school has provided is only geared towards small amounts of meetings with a focus on dealing with workload. Feels as if none of the support staff are actually even open to the idea that it’s possible that she might be mentally ill. Feels as if people hear that she is “anxious” and latch onto that as her only problem because that is an easy to deal with thing that a lot of people have. Her parents are not open to acknowledging that she might not be in perfect mental health, she has repeatedly asked them for support, but they are consistently dismissive; they jump to “you’re a teenager, this happens to everyone” a lot. From the professionals she has seen i.e. doctors (no actual therapists apart from an unhelpful one provided by the school, with a limit of six sessions, all of which she felt were actively damaging to her mental health) she's been told she should exercise more, that all of her problems are because of school or ""they just smile"". According to her ""The only thing they let me follow up on is if I was anemic or not, so they did a blood-test that they kept losing and that I had to come back in for. And it ended up that I wasn't anemic"". This remains the most she's had done towards her mental health.
* When she has a flare up of any of her symptoms she feels inexplicably angry and greatly frustrated, making it feel impossible to her to do any constructive stuff towards feeling better (i.e. thinking positive, breathing exercises etc), and this in turn makes her feel more hopeless and she becomes more and more angry. She says this anger has been getting worse over time to the point that she feels almost constantly frustrated.
* She has toxic thoughts such as feeling jealous of the ""Me too"" movement itself because she's never been harassed before, and the women involved have ""because they're pretty and must be viewed by the men as desirable and I want that"". 
* She feels suicidal at times, but she doesn’t think she’ll act on this at the moment. She says it’s not because of self-loathing but because she doesn’t feel it can ever get better. She hasn’t brought this up to anyone because she’s worried about being sectioned or the like. (I don’t know how realistic this is, but she feels this legitimately.) She doesn’t cut herself, but she says she bites the skin on her fingers with the intention of feeling pain, and presses the painful parts against surfaces to make it hurt more (she doesn’t know if this is related or just the “push on a bruise to see how much it hurts” kind of thing (She didn’t want me to include this part because she was worried it sounded fake or like she was making a common thing seem like a problem that was specific to her)). 

We're honestly at a loss, and are feeling kind of hopeless about the situation, and were wondering if there is any options for receiving help in the UK that two people of our ages could take up (We're both 17). She wants to know ""whether this is even worth pursuing or if I'm just being silly.""

Thanks in advance.",02Mar2018,2,
4,"This is a kind of strange thing. As you would probably tell from the title, but it kinda bugs me a lot. I feel like I struggle to think. Especially when I am with others. I am used to always being aware or kinda anxious or stressed out so I am almost always thinking about something. I was never one for 'just going through the motions' of a day. I have had days like that and I lay in bed at the end and realize I had a good day, but I didn't have any new thoughts or actions. I mean sure I was having a good time and everyone around me accepted my presence far more than usual, but I just can't stand those days. this problem is is that i feel like that is how everyone else's day is. Reacting to what someone says or does in the same way as everyone else around me. I am rarely like that. Sure I do hate it when I get mad at someone for mocking me or making fun of me or looking at me the way everyone does, but I can't be happy the way I am typically or how i imagine everyone else is and it all comes down to how I think.

I like to always think. About the admin and how they are trying make my senior year horrible, how precious our personalities are, astronomy, the voices I make in my head to bring a different personality to the board in a discussion, how anxious i get and how I will try to handle an upcoming social situation that I mistakenly agreed to, and a variety of other things. How ever I often find myself clutching my head in class whispering to myself to think while those other two voice I may or may not make harass me for it. I just wonder if for just some other average person how they go about their day in regard to thinking. i think I am right in saying we all have reactive thoughts on the actions of those around us, but what about your own personal things. I most those pointless action movies that just distract you for a couple hours, I know this is an unpopular opinion which is way I do try so hard not voice it, and TV shows. I just end up trying to think. I am not obsessive about this, I just feel like no one else has this issue.",02Mar2018,3,

7,"I recently went inpatient for severe depression. I hadn't gotten out of bed in 10 days. Invasive thoughts of suicide. I was there for 6 days. I went to the VA. The mental health floor there is more for triage. They stabilize then figure out where you need to go from there. Its short term. So, my diagnosis remains the same: PTSD due to military sexual trauma, acute, chronic major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety and methamphetamine dependence disorder. I am clean and sober. I was on Citalopram, trazadone, and hydroxyzine. They adjusted dosing for trazadone and hydoxyzine, lowering my nighttime dosage. Hydroxyzine for sleep paralysis. Trazadone to put me to sleep. It was too high. They changed me from Citalopram to escitalopram. They also gave me more hydroxyzine to take for anxiety. The most telling discovery though had nothing to do with my meds. Or even the thoughts in my head or the crushing sadness. It had to do with my fatigue. Turns out that my blood pressure is super low. Like 80s over 40s low. That's why its so hard to get out of bed. I'm legitimately tired. Once I'm in the lying position, my blood pressure drops. Standing, I'm still 100s over 60s. I takes 7 cups of coffee to bring it to 120s over 70s. So yes, I'm depressed. But it feels like meds aren't working because of my blood pressure. On one hand, its good. I'm gonna live a very long time. On the other hand, my quality of life may not be great and it seriously limits my treatment options for anxiety. It was very validating. Finally, I'm not lazy. I have a real, measurable reason for the tiredness I feel. I see my PCP soon for options. Although I was told there aren't very many. Just thought I'd share.",02Mar2018,68,
8,"In two weeks, I am set to speak in front of my entire school about my struggles with depression as a bigger part of an outreach day the school leadership is planning. I intend to discuss the struggle that is depression, tell my personal story, and finally send two big messages about mental illness to my school. I’d like to first address those who may suffer from mental illness and help them to know that there can be hope. That I understand how much it forces you to feel worthless and isolate yourself, but that if we all can learn to help one another, we can begin to not be alone. The other is to address those who may hold a stigma against mental illness or simply don’t know how to help at all. I would love it if y’all here at r/mentalhealth could give me some feedback and overall relay to me what some of the most important things need to be addressed in regard to mental health. 

Here’s a few questions to guide your feedback if you’d like to answer them. If not, feel free to share some thoughts and ideas with me it’d be much appreciated. Love y’all. It’s hard. I know.

1. As a person who suffers from mental illness, what does it help to hear? What helps to give you hope?
2. How can others help?
3. What’s one thing you think people need to better understand about mental illness and depression?
4. What do you wish for in the future for the mental health community?
5. What do you think I really need to relay to other people who may be suffering from mental illness?

10,"Hi all, just wanted to vent a little. (I’m forever sorry for using the miracle of the internet for such selfish and unimportant means LOLLL) 

When I was in junior high, my best friend had severe social anxiety. I had severe general anxiety. We would be upset and sad and feel like life was worthless, but would always remind each other that our futures were bright. (We were both straight A students with foolishly optimistic views of the future) We would tell each other that when we were older, wiser, in our 20s, in university in a big city following our dreams that we would feel bigger and better. That was our #1 reason for staying alive. Now we are in our 20s, she lives alone with her parents without a job and I just moved to a new city miserable, sad, and an outcast. Pretty much the polar opposite of what we had both hoped so much for and really believed would happen. 

I tried meds, and they made me suicidal. I’m seeing a counsellor right now, but I sort of think he’s more of a general community helper rather than someone I can truly get better with. I’m going through with it anyways but I’ve been several times and it hasn’t helped, his solutions seem trivial considering I have been severely anxious (and maybe depressed but idk for sure) for 6 years.

I’m working towards a jobless degree, getting mediocre grades, making zero meaningful friendships, showing up to clubs just to be an outcast as always, frustrating and offending my S/O constantly. I’m getting paid in a couple of days but I have been living off instant soup and cereal with $3 in my bank account. Every time I try to get my life together it just seems to fall apart again in two or three days. Thankfully I can’t afford alcohol/weed to drown my struggles in 

I am naturally an optimistic person (surprise! Gotcha!) and always hope for and assume the best out of the world. It’s just hard to be happy when everything makes me worried, I’m constantly on edge, irritable, and wondering how I’ve been mentally ill for so long with few people realizing how bad it is. Sometimes I feel depressed, and then hate myself and blame myself for being so “pessimistic” even though I can’t really help it. 

Anyone with mental health issues knows how hard it is to talk to people about your issues. I can’t reach out to anyone because I’ll burden then and become “that anxious/depressed/suicidal” friend. What should I do? I can only see my counsellor once a month and every time I lie and say that seeing him is making me feel better. 

I constantly frustrate my S/O. I constantly, always, feel like he secretly hates me and is about to break up with me (which probably makes me very annoying.) Even if i do something wrong and apologize I go the next week feeling like somethings wrong and that I’m ruining our relationship. 

I tried reaching out to a friend who I know is depressed, but when we hung out I just felt alone and like an outcast and like my problems were so much different that hers (even though they’re very similar.)

In general I feel like an outcast that will always be an outcast. When I hang out with my S/O, my family, my friends, I feel alone and different. No one wants to hear what I have to say and I am constantly ignored/interrupted. Everything makes me anxious, I’m honestly shocked I’m capable of leaving my apartment building. I feel like the only reasons I haven’t killed myself are the fear of violence as well as it being considered the “easy way out”. Like I just don’t want to traumatize anyone accidentally. 

Ok I’m done peace",02Mar2018,2,
11,"Backstory: I would like to start this out by saying I have always been an anxious person and I try to only be on medication when I'm going through extreme periods of stress/change. This mindset has been quite the problem while trying to find a mental healthcare provider that will not over-prescribe medication where I live. 

I saw one for not being able to take exams without panic attacks while I was still in college and ended up on five different medications to combat the side effects (which resulted in the diagnoses of being bipolar and having ADHD). Three years ago, I found a doctor who agreed that being on that much medication was not benefiting me at all because the side effects were outweighing the positives. This Dr. Prescribed every new-to-the market medication he knew of. He was especially fond of one, which made me gain 50lbs in six months, but it 'leveled' me out (so to speak). I told him that I was uncomfortable with the quick weight gain, but he told me 'I looked great' and that I shouldn't worry about it. Fast forward six months &amp; I found out I had extremely high cholesterol and blood pressure. I was very active person and was eating a well balanced diet, so my primary care doctor was confident in saying it was the medication. A few months went by and I felt like I was in a good enough of a place to be able to manage my anxiety with regular therapy apts and by being off of medication. I told my psychiatrist about the side effects I was experiencing, where I was in my life, and that I wanted to wean myself off of the medication and he stated that he was not comfortable and that ""the next time I see him, I will want to kill myself."" I had no suicidal ideation for the many months I was seeing him, so there was no logical reason why being off of the medication/lowering the dosage would be such a terrible idea. I walked out of the appointment and talked to my primary care Dr. We were able to get me off of the meds and I have been off of them for the last two years and have had no issues.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Fast forward: Six months ago, I was feeling overwhelmed because there were a ton of life changes going on and I felt like I needed a little 'help' getting through them without having panic attacks. I talked to my primary care doctor, who was very understanding and she prescribed lexapro. I had been on it without any side effects for the past six months, until my insurance decided not to cover without the prescription going mail order. The only mail order company they want people to go through recently was bought out and is extremely unorganized at the moment. It took four days just to get someone on the phone there (with 40+ minute wait times on the phone)  to confirm that they received the script that my dr. faxed to them and they said they would have it shipped out ASAP. It took them ten days to ship it out. I missed 3 days of medication. After two weeks of being on this new medication, I noticed that I started to feel differently. I was having terrible night sweats, having crazy nightmares, and felt 'off' during the day.  

   
&amp;nbsp;
Three days ago, I had a 'psychotic break' at night and thought I was in my childhood home, couldn't stop hyperventilating, and couldn't move or speak coherently. The last two days I have been in and out of it with feeling extremely disoriented/not 'present' (and thus not being able to work or drive) and have periods where I cannot speak coherently or speak at all without slurring sentences. My primary care Dr. suggested seeing a psychiatrist the day after the psychotic break and to discontinue the medication, but the only one with availability before late april/early may was the one I saw previously. I called the psychiatrist's office at 9am on 02/20 and explained to the receptionist what was going on and they were able to squeeze me in for a 2 o'clock appointment. I showed up 15 minutes early and got turned away because they did not book enough time. I called a family member to help and they were able to get me a 45min appointment for the next day.  


&amp;nbsp;
The doctor took me 15 minutes late, wasn't listening to me about my withdrawal symptoms, and wanted to push a high dose of bipolar/depression medication on me, even though I have not been depressed (or had suicidal idealization). He told me to just trust him and pick up samples of this new medication at his other clinic that night (Which he called in for while I was in the room) and ushered me out within 15 minutes of seeing him. I had my significant other drive me to the clinic immediately after the appointment, but it was closed.   
&amp;nbsp;

I went into the emergency room this morning because I felt so disoriented and could not talk coherently or without slurring. The most they did was give me a room and take my blood pressure and pulse.   
&amp;nbsp;

I told them the withdrawal symptoms, and was literally begging for treatment that could keep me orientated/to help with the headaches. They suggested that I check into their inpatient psychiatric unit (w/ a mandatory 24+hr hold), but because it is Friday, the doctor would not be able to evaluate me until Tuesday+. I did not receive any treatment whatsoever and was literally crying in the hospital bed asking for them to treat me like I wasn't crazy.  I discharged from the hospital a few hours ago and have been trying to stay semi 'with-it' at home. I did not receive any referrals for the side effects or advice on how to handle this.   
&amp;nbsp;

I feel extremely disappointed with my experiences and have absolutely no idea what to do during this process. I felt like I was in-and-out of reality and was unable to get help without volunteering to go back onto medication (which I would like to avoid because of how long it take to fill via mail order&amp; my history with wacky side effects). I felt so helpless and I didnt know what to even do since emergency care will not even help me.

15,"Okay so there’s no way of explaining my sister’s life and everything that led up to where she is now in a Reddit post, but I’m just looking for some help. I’ll try to explain everything as accurately and to the point as possible. Oh and I’m from the US.

My parents do not know what to do.

She’s 21 years old. Lies all the time. She lied about being enrolled in college this past semester until my parents finally found out the truth about two weeks ago. She literally lies about everything, big or small. 

I’ve heard the phrase “if you keep running into assholes constantly, you’re probably the asshole.” She has never been able to maintain friends for a long time. All the people she calls her friends seem like they just use her.

She is overweight and definitely binges on unhealthy food often. My mom goes grocery shopping for the family and always makes sure the fridge/pantry is stocked with good, healthy food. She still will buy snacks and some unhealthy stuff once in a while. But my sister rarely eats at home, she always eats out.. which leads to the next issue.

I feel like she has no grasp of reality. She doesn’t pay for anything important. My parents ask for $100 a month for “rent” and she can’t even pay them that on time. She barely works and spends all of her money on clothes, makeup, food, and weed. She even canceled the automatic $25 a month deposit from her bank account into her Roth account. 

She’s constantly smoking weed and just lays in bed when she’s home. Has no physical activity. Gets extremely angry and upset at the smallest inconveniences/issues.

So she has been diagnosed with a hormonal imbalance (something like that?) but refused to go back to the doctor and start treatment. My mom believes it’s because the doctor may have wanted her to lost weight first. But we don’t know anything for sure because of doctor-patient confidentiality. 

I just don’t see how going to a psychologist/psychiatrist will be helpful if she’s just going to lie the entire time. Any suggestions or even thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

26,"For a little background: I went through some traumatic stuff in my childhood, and I now have serious issues with social anxiety/depression/general human interaction. 

I started seeing my current therapist about a year ago. I really like her a lot. She tries very hard to help me. She’s been suggesting for a while that I attend a group specifically catered towards women who have experienced trauma. My therapist runs the group along with another, older woman. 

I went last week for the first time and hated it. There were only 7 other women in the group, and all but one were much older than me. My therapist assured me that I would not be forced to speak, and while that was technically true, the other woman running the group put a great deal of emphasis on all of us sharing thoughts/feelings/facts about ourselves, as well as participating in q&amp;a type exercises.There was also a bit of arts and crafts, which I’m sure is helpful for some people. I just thought it was stupid. 

Ultimately, I’m disappointed because I was truly hoping that this group would be the thing that finally works for me. As of right now, it just feels like another waste of time. I know I only went once, but it just felt deeply uncomfortable. I’m way too cynical for positive affirmations and making collages or whatever. 

On the other hand, I’m afraid that if I leave the group, I’ll end up disappointing my therapist, who I’m sure is already struggling to find ways to help me. 

TLDR - I went to group therapy once and thought it was dumb. Keep going and see if it helps with my (very serious, life ruining) issues, or bail and stick to one-on-one therapy?

27,"I'm a student athlete in college and over the course of this school year, I've experienced my ""sophomore slump"" per se, in all aspects of my life: academically (poor grades), athletically (poor performance this season), and socially (first year of living off the college campus is making me feel socially disconnected despite living with teammates). It's been hard to put my feelings into words but I feel this year there was a lack of drive and/or purpose in my pursuits, despite having supportive family, teammates and friends. The inspirations that I had in my life in the last year (and prior) do not resonate with me this year. If someone were to ask me right now who/what motivates me, I wouldn't be able to respond without lying to the person asking making up some bull answer just to get them off of my chest. I'm really unsure of the steps to take to get back to the place I was last year, since I used to be a person that was full of energy, excitement and personality. Now I feel like every time I interact with a person, I put on the mask of who I was last year and go through the motions. 
If anybody has experienced what I've been feeling I'd really appreciate your advice through comments or PM's. ",02Mar2018,1,

yes I'm depressed and suicide looks good, it always has...

The cause of my depression is due to the fact i can't land anything worth while...

I don't care about being rich, but money is my biggest problem with depression. If I had about 300,000 dollars I wouldn't be depressed. 

I just want a nice house, not one that is falling apart around me, and I can't afford to fix ALL the stuff wrong. 

I want a halfway decent job, that will make me the money to make that dream a reality.

I had a shot at happiness when I was in the marines, but I really fucked that up on my own and I can't rejoin...So that just adds to my depression.

So why does it matter if I put myself down? ",02Mar2018,1,
30,"Everyone I’ve ever known is hiding something from me, like I did something and nobody is supposed to talk to me about it or else it might happen again. Kind of like they’re all in on a joke that I’m not a part of. ",02Mar2018,10,
31,"Thoughts and revelations about my childhood and family experiences are quite recent, I normally don't dwell on the past. I am in my late 20s, never had a relationship, only have 1 true friend that lives over 100 miles away. My life consists of going to work, gym, and wasting time on the computer.

As a kid, from my first days at school I was bullied and excluded because of my 'funny-sounding' last name. I would come home to lots of tension and arguments between my parents centered around money (and infidelity - unsubstantiated, just retarded insecurity). It would sometimes get physical. They would go to work, come home in the evening, cooked us food, and were then either arguing, complaining that something hadn't been cleaned properly, or emotionally unavailable and glued to the TV. Dad would often just leave to the garage (that was a 30 min walk away, so not attached to the house). I cannot recall a single time I could come to them to talk about my problems at school, or to even talk about girls or other relationships, or just guidance in general.

I also had a high-school-popular older sister who was an emotionally unstable narcissist growing up. To give you a taste of the kinds of arguments we had, she once said I was such a narcissist (I now realise the projection here) that I renamed all the icons on the computer as MY (i.e. My Computer, My Documents etc...). My parents, being non-computer-literate, and yielding to my sister's emotional appeals, would scold me and force me on the defensive. I have also now realised that I was raised on the idea that I will be loved and appreciated by my parents only if I do exactly as they tell me to do.

Anyway, so this was my environment growing up, and I just got on with it, because I did not know anything different. After finishing school, I left home for uni in another country. My parents largely supported me through my first couple of years - I had trouble finding a good part-time job, and whatever money I made, I would always just offset the living costs. I never felt comfortable spending it on nights out, or even good clothes - so I didn't. I felt very self-conscious about money at this stage, so it was hard socialising and making friends. Whenever people would see me, I would look like I was about to kill someone. Constant tension, not helped by lack of sleep due to living in really noisy dorms. Self-confidence in social situations was non-existent. I just wanted to be left alone.

Scraped through uni, building (what I think is) a decent career path. Problem is, right now, I feel like I am sucked into a routine with work, gym, and no other outside interests (or desire to pursue them). I tried putting myself out there for online dating, which was not a total trainwreck, but it didn't go anywhere. I had done some thinking on why, and concluded it's because I don't like myself very much.  I am unable to talk about things I am passionate about (I am very big on philosophy and psychology, but these are heavy topics to bring up on a date), I do not feel like there's anything I'm good at (that I am devoted to), which makes it hard to connect in the dating environment, and I am unable to meet someone through mutual friends, because I don't have any. I am not a total hermit, and I can freely talk to people - I just rarely feel like I want to, and often when I do, it feels like putting on a mask. I do not have any friends because I failed to build up my social circle outside of work when coming to another country (UK). I do not go to pubs or clubs. I struggle to stick doing new things, because I feel like I will never get it to a standard I would be content with, due to starting it this late in life.

My biggest hurdle, however, is the feeling that I will never be able to shake the stigma of my upbringing. If I am asked why I've never been in a relationship, and I explain all of that, it instantly paints me as 'damaged goods'. When dating, people also seem to project their own life experiences and values onto your situation, so when you say 'I've never been in a relationship', they may take that at face value, assuming someone has had the same type of upbringing and social environment they had.  And as a guy, you are expected to be this strong assertive character, so it seems highly unattractive when you reveal these weaknesses to someone. I am not looking for someone to fix me, or to be my entertainment, I feel like my life would be more meaningful if I devoted myself to someone (does that come from trying to compensate the fear of abandonment?). What also keeps me going is the hope that I will one day be able to beat this, and not pretend like it's fixed with false confidence - really overcome it. I could then be there for someone else. However, I have grown cold and detached, and I fear I will struggle to be emotionally available and to fulfill someone's needs in a relationship.

Whenever I tried to speak to my parents about this, they would just dismiss it and say 'oh yeah, well, some people have it worse' or, 'well, some people don't even have parents', and with my sister it quickly turns into a contest of who has it worse, i.e. I say something I am struggling with or have struggled with in the past (involving her), instead of acknowledging it, she sees it as an opportunity for some one-upsmanship. I did not find this helpful.

Has anyone else gone through this? Are you able to offer some insight into what it's like on the other side?

I once tried using step change to help my situation and it made everything 100 times worse so I'm extremely skeptical to turn to outside advice although at this point I feel so trapped and hopeless I have no idea what to do.

I think about suicide a lot, almost everyday, but I don't think it's because I'm unhappy with my life. I think it's due to thinking about the attention I would gain after I died. Although it does seem nice knowing I wouldn't have any responsibilities to worry about. I do crave attention but as soon as I'm in the spotlight I cower and push it away.

38,"So I've (21, US) been dealing with major depression and severe anxiety for years now, and I have never successfully been able to make any significant change for the better. I've had a little success with talk therapy, and I do plan on finding a new therapist (just moved from the east coast to SoCal), but even when I tried that it was only superficially helpful. I understood better why I was feeling the way I was and how to deal with it, but the overwhelming depression and anxiety was still always there. 

I was previously prescribed lexapro, which frankly, didn't seem to do much for me at any dosage. It fucked with my sleep cycle and I had an apparently rare ""electric shock"" side effect if I missed a dose which was no good. I tried hydroxyzine 25 mg for panic attacks, which works in that it knocks me out, but other than that doesn't do anything. I was on Buproprion which seemed to help me feel a little bit motivated when I was at 150 mg, but it was just enough to get me out of bed, not enough to make me want to do...anything. Eventually I was bumped up to Forfivo 300mg and was suddenly actually productive, but then I started having intense anxiety attacks so I stopped taking it. 

Now I'm not taking anything and while I am trying so hard to do basic daily tasks like showering and brushing my teeth and eating food, I just run out of motivation to do anything but sit in bed if I take on too much. Or the opposite happens and I get manic and take on too much and crash HARD and get suicidal. My anxiety has always been about the same, in that I am unable to function like a regular person in public. I stutter and get nervous when I have to talk to anyone including people I know, I have issues with eye contact, I get anxious and fuck up basic tasks like taking tickets in parking garages or ordering at a coffee shop. It takes me five times as long as most people to do something and then I usually fuck up and do it wrong. 

I know I need to be on something. But every time I talk to a new psychiatrist they just ask me what I've been on and if it worked, and if I mention any minuscule improvement on any med, they put me back on it and at a higher dose. None of what I've tried so far has helped me in any meaningful way, and I don't want to go back on lexapro just because *maybe* I had two more productive days a month.

I'd like to be able to go into a psych appointment and be able to advocate for myself and ask for a medication/s that could actually help. Any ideas/suggestions are very welcome. Thank you!",02Mar2018,1,
39,"Hi there! First timer here. 
I'm feeling pretty down and I don't feel like I can talk to anybody. 

I'm diagnosed with depression and currently take Lexapro at a low dose. I've been taking it since early November of 2017 and seeking help with a therapist monthly since September 2017. 

I actually improved greatly after starting the medication and had a good few months. But I'm in the middle of changing jobs right now and I think the stress is really weighing on me. 

Recently I can't sleep well. I'm tossing and turning and talking in my sleep. I can't eat well. Nothing sounds good and I have no motivation to cook so I'll settle for snacks almost every meal. I don't make dinner for my fiancé and I anymore. My work responsibilities are pretty much finished, so work performance is ok, but I've been late to work twice this month which literally NEVER happens. I have zero motivation even though I have so much to do, so I just lay around sleeping when I get done with work, which means the housework piles up. 

I'm living in a country different from that which I grew up in and there's a definite language barrier that always adds a level of stress to things. I mention this because my fiancé isn't a native English speaker, so sometimes he doesn't fully get what I'm saying or I misunderstand him and we argue. I think there are also some really deep cultural expectations that I be the primary housekeeper as a woman, but I just flat out don't have the energy these days to even pull what I'd consider my weight when it comes to chores. Usually it's not a problem because I just do it and he supports me in other ways. But recently I can't do anything. Sometimes he will be supportive and say it's a good thing for me to rest, other times he is quite critical. I never know which mood he will be in. It's hard for me to talk to him about my depressed feelings because he is always under a lot of pressure at work and has little energy give me beyond short ""cheer up"" kind of talks. 

My parents are across the ocean so I really hate to worry them. My closest friends are the same, or are under the impression that the depression is taken care of since I was getting so much better. 

My therapist... I'd like to go more frequently but English language counseling is so expensive and I'm already having some small financial troubles. I had to cancel my appointment this month due to financial stress. 

So I don't know how to get myself out of this and am looking for advice, somebody to talk to, something like that. Thanks in advance!",02Mar2018,2,

42,"Hello again,

I'm still struggling with finding a way to live my life. The reason is that, well, I guess I have depressions, at the very least that was what I've been treated for before.

The way I tried and tried again to deal with this before is to just FORCE myself to do things. Force myslef to act and think certain ways. Force myself to act friendly and intelligent in conversations, force myself to do very specific exercises when weight lifting (even though I would've much rather done different exercises, I don't hate weight lifting in general), forced myself to go to uni and do research for my Master's degree according to a very specific set of physical laws, etc etc. It basically extended to my entire life.

And it gets me results, but I completely supress my feelings while doing so and I also never can keep it up for long. Like today. I don't have the energy to control myself like that. And it scares me because I've been struggling for so long it feels like becoming a ""robot"" in that way is the only way I can ever succeed, but it's also something I can't keep up and will never be happy doing.

So,in the mornings I usually feel very happy and ready to do anything.I feel positive to go back to that country.I make plans on how,when,where etc.

But in the evening,usually when the sun starts to go down,I feel powerless to do anything.I hate the way the sky changes colors and how there is this melancholy everywhere.I’m scared to leave my family and embark on such a long journey all by myself.I’m even scared to go somewhere else in my own country.I feel fragile,scared,weak and fragile to do anything really.

I'm going to keep names private, but let's just say my friend Jacob, who is 23 has a very selfish dad. Jacob's dad demands attention, love, obedience and wants to have a part in every aspect of Jacob's life, whether it's knowing where Jacob is going at any time of the day, to demanding Jacob seeks his advice for all of his actions, and if he does something without doing so first, the dad will lash out at Jacob. He will call Jacob useless, call him garbage, call him names, constantly belittle his emotional state, blame him for all the problems, his dad will play victim saying things like ""because you hurt yourself because of ""me"", I have to be careful of what I say around you, but I'm not going to do that anymore, I won't hold back."" The dad will also often say things like ""you need therapy sessions, you clearly have mental issues, how can anyone be as submissive and passive as you, with such low self esteem"", while proceeding to belittle Jacob, make fun of him for these things, and then demand submission to his every whim. 
Jacob isn't very good at confronting his dad, if he brings up his issues, his dad gets very loud and violent, denying any wrong he's done, yelling his head off at Jacob, saying everyone is against him, and even sometimes getting physical, not necessarily always exerting the violence directly onto Jacob's body, but it's very scary nonetheless. Jacob's dad does not seem to care about changing himself or looking inwards, he only blames Jacob for everything, and will keep on pushing Jacob with passive aggressive things such as ""you clearly don't want me in your life, you're better without me"", because he wants Jacob to say ""no I didn't say that"", and then reassure him that it's not his fault, and it's Jacob at fault. Jacob does this every time and only hurts himself more because he cares for his dad and wants him to be happy. Jacob's dad refuses to believe he has any effect on Jacob's issues of submissiveness, low self esteem, depression, or self harm. Simply says ""it's your own fault"".

I want to try to help Jacob find a safe way to communicate his problems about his dad, and possibly work it out. My suggestion is to get a therapy session where Jacob can present his problems and feelings, and see what someone else has to say outside of me. If the therapist comes to see that a lot of Jacob's issues stem from his dad, is it possible for the therapist to suggest calling in Jacob's dad? I'm not sure if therapists do that, but I was hoping it would lead to a safe environment where Jacob can talk to his dad while getting a turn to present his side of the story and his feelings, without getting drowned out by screaming and scared into submission.",02Mar2018,4,

I started this as a long post, thinking it would be helpful to start at the beginning, but it doesn't seem to much matter. The long and short is that I'm sad. I've always been that sad person, who doesn't seem sad. I cover it up, whether when I was a kid, by hiding in books, or in college, by drinking far too much and leaving before he woke up, or now, working 2 jobs, living a busy life and floating through everything. I'm sick of being a ghost. I'm sick of coping. 


This is the 4th different drug in 3 years. It handles the anxiety, but not the depression. I'm noticing other behaviors start to pop up, the nasty stuff - the manic, hyper episodes, where I can go hours without sleep, I'm wired for days, usually because I forgot my meds for a day or two and I feel FUCKING GREAT. Or more usual, I'm exhausted, slept through 3 alarms, late for work, but once more can't fall asleep that night. I'm getting impulsive, I want to make snap decisions. I can't tell if I'm trying to do it to shake things up and shake myself out of a funk, or it's something more serious.


My friends are split between thinking I'm fine, or I'm about to kill myself. I joke and say we can flip a coin. I'm not going to, not because I don't want to, but because there's too many people I care about who would be devastated if I did something that stupid. 


At the end of the day, I'm sick of being sad. I want to know... where's that magic cocktail that makes me feel human again? Where's the therapist who discovers my secret source of pain and suddenly I'm free? More simply, when do I get to feel better? ",02Mar2018,3,
63,"Also I said horrible things to her. Like she was dead to me. And she was no sister of mine. When she had convulsions I will watch her die.


I'm 22 she's 20

She pissed me off. I'm fed up with her. But I overreacted. she is always mean to me and I'm really done with her. I've been there for her and she treats me like scum. And always wants to put me in trouble. And everything I do is wrong and I'm stupid. Still that doesn't justifies my actions. 

I need help. I don't want to be like this. But I just really can't handle being treated like I'm useless and the worst brother. Since her attitude makes me barely talk to her lately. And she feels superior than me. 

I want to move out but need my parents for college money. ",02Mar2018,4,
64,"Can an isolated, traumatic, situational event cause persistent or chronic suicidal thoughts?

Even after the traumatic event is over and done with? 

If so, what is this called? Is there any word or scientific term that describes this so I can research it?

I'd like to figure out how I can possibly speak about this or deal with it.",02Mar2018,2,

68,"Hello, 
I've been thinking for a long time about posting this or not, as there is always the risk of being recognized, which I do not want. But now the time has come. I also do not know if this post fits into this subreddit, if not the moderators can delete it.

It's about getting ill since the beginning of 2016. Sounds not bad at first, but with more details it is really bad. You'll probably wonder how many times I've been sick (we're still talking about physical illnesses like the flu, etc). Well since the beginning of 2016, 26 months have passed and in these 26 months, I was about 30-35 times in sick leave. Mostly at least once every 3 weeks for exactly one week. The symptoms are always the same as with a cold or flu.

Now you would say ""Go to the doctor and let everything control what is possible"", I can only say: I HAVE -&gt; Nothing. My doctors always say I should be healthy. But I'm not crazy I feel that I am sick. Now my family always says that if it's physically not that I'm mentally ill. I am not. I have no mental problems that burden me. What all of them do not understand is that the only thing that bothers me is the physical illnesses and the constant sick leave.

In the meantime I am so far that it only makes me mentally ill. Constantly when friends say ""Let's go have a drink."" or ""Let's do something together"" I have to cancel and when they ask why I just say ""I'm sick"" and only get to hear ""Again?"" like I'm lying. Workplace the same. I started in January in a new company and have been in sick leave 3 times since JANUARY. 1x flu 1x cold and now cold again. And that is exactly what makes me mentally ill. I can not stand this anymore. After 2 1/2 years without hope for improvement or a diagnosis what I could have and how I manage to get well again.

Life is no longer worth living like that. I do not kill myself, that you misunderstand me. But I'm at the point where life is no fun anymore.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Or do you have tips? Proposals? Question? I'm grateful for every input!",02Mar2018,1,
69,Hes willing to try to stop using them for coping to work on healthier coping skills but he doesn't know how. I'm bad at articulating my words and don't want to accidentally say the wrong thing or something that reinforces his thought of alcohol and weed the only outlet. Hes seeing a therapist which he doesn't think is helping but I'm so proud of him for going and for even willing to try new methods.  Any advice on what to do / how to get him started? I don't know how to approach the situation. He's not comfortable talking to his therapist about anything yet,02Mar2018,2,
70,"This afternoon, my friend texted me, telling me that they were feeling 'really suicidal'. I dropped what I was doing and called them, but the current circumstances mean they can't call back for another 45 minutes. They said they don't want to talk in person, they just want to either sleep or drink all day and they're losing interest in everything. I've helped this person out, and they've also been a big help to me as well, so I feel compelled to do something for them.

I'm scared, what the hell do I do?",02Mar2018,2,
71,"i am so ashamed about this and i have a therapist but i’m too afraid and embarrassed to bring this up to her but i’ve been feeling this way for a really long time. i know i definitely shouldn’t and it’s super unhealthy and i’ve never talked about it ever. 

basically, i like being like used. or manipulated. i was really into this guy who kinda shitty towards me at times and he was the biggest gaslighter ever. i knew but i didn’t really care, i just wanted him to like me. i know i have some insecurity issues. 

i’ve been in abusive relationships before, they didn’t like beat me up but there was a little smacking around and stuff. when i was younger my dad used to hit my dad and i was super against it and i think domestic violence is horrible, but when my past boyfriends did it to me i didn’t care that much. i’m so confused on why i’m like this. 

im also sexually submissive. like throw me around, manhandle me, whatever. i even have like rape fantasies. i don’t wanna feel this way at all because i know it’s wrong but idk why i’m like this. im not really sexually promisicous and i’m pretty much a normal girl except this. 

i don’t even seem like the type of girl you can really around and stuff, i have a pretty strong personality. can anyone think of a reason why i’m like this? ",02Mar2018,2,

75,"This hasn't happened in a while that I've been aware of but lately my mood has been changing very rapidly within minutes/seconds depending on the situation. My grandmother said earlier today ""He's not in his state of mind today"".

I've also been dealing with severe depersonalization/derealization disorder along with PTSD, panic disorder, and ocd rumination. I've been in and out of pysch hospitals for quite some time. I've read that dissociation is on 3 levels dissociative depersonalization/derealization, dissociative amnesia(fugue state), and dissociative identity disorder(multiple personality disorder). I'm afraid that I am developing multiple personality disorder. I don't have any alters I am aware of I don't put on a 'name' for a state of how I am feeling I just am aware that my mood swings and thinking rapidly change upon instance. One minute I feel confused, hazed, mindblank, severe out of body robot experience, then rarely I will feel happy or laugh for a few seconds when clearly I am miserable. People comment on my mood often it is very obvious sometimes I think I am psychotic but crazy people don't realize they are crazy right?",02Mar2018,2,
76,"First of all i don't know if this is the right place to post this as i don't know if this would even fall under a symptom of mental illness. 
Basically my name is Ben, extremely common and simple. I've always had problems with self confidence growing up and am in 2nd year of college now. Due to how common the name is almost every grade level had another Ben in it and in combination with my confidence problems (and that most of the time the other Ben was more popular/more approachable/had more friends) i'd always assume that when my name was shouted out, they meant the other person. Fast forward however many years to now and i've basically trained myself to ignore the name completely unless someone is talking directly to my face. Friends of mine are getting concerned cause there is another Ben in our college program, i'd just like some opinions on the matter. Thank you",02Mar2018,2,

I’m so used to being in a depression, that when I’m not in a depression I’m waiting for the crash. When I’m hypomanic, I’m waiting for the crash. Just want to see if that is an experience anyone else has as well. My psychologist keeps telling me to stop waiting for the crash and just live now, but it’s hard to do that when you are so used to be in a state of depression. So yeah, anyone else?",02Mar2018,1,
