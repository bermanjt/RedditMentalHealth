1,"As the title says, it's been a tough time. My condition got a lot better between 18 and now, but I still have flashbacks, high paranoia about the past, irrational thoughts and regressions. I have a job and go to university, and have what people would call a pretty stable life, apart from this condition constantly holding me back. I still think about what happened at least once every day. I was wondering if anyone had any tips on handling PTSD and it's symptoms? 

Before suggestions, I've been trying different therapies (CBT, specialised desensitizing therapy, group therapy and mindfulness) with a few different doctors and institutions since I got away from the traumatic situation. I've also been on medication for clinical depression since. Both have helped with my mood but not my outlook of 'getting better' and seem to have a very short term effect.

I would appreciate any advice or questions.

2,"I'm looking for advice on how to provide the proper nurturing support to my 11 year old brother. I'm his oldest sister and haven't lived in the home for over 14 years and my younger sister moved out 11 years ago. Our little brother is basically growing up as an only child in a home that turned into a nightmare about this time last year, when our step-father's alcoholism and abusive nature came to light.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning our brother witnessed our step-father's suicide attempt. He was inside the house when he heard the gunshot and saw blood all over the snow when he looked outside. He ran to hide and called emergency. At least, that’s what he is telling us and the social worker. The responding officers tried to clean up as much as they could but it was still a horrific scene outside when my sister got there to take him out of the house.

&amp;#x200B;

He's not a dumb kid and has now been exposed to something completely unimaginable. We are trying to keep him in a PG rated loop with our step-father’s condition. We have also been trying to keep his spirits up with an energetic pup and keep his mind occupied with games and activities. Tomorrow we're taking him snowboarding. I just feel like any minute now he's going to call us out on our bullshit and we have no idea what to do or say. My sister and I both have no experience with suicide or violence to this extreme, we also do not have children of our own. He's kind of it for us, the little bro we can spoil. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 11 year old saw failed suicide by gunshot this morning. What is the best way to support him and avoid lifelong scars and trauma?

I have chronic pain, fatigue, nausea, and insomnia and I'm not allowed to leave my room. Everything I do outside this room including communicating to those outside my room ends badly for me. I'm forced confined, being stuck forced in here and my health hurts. I left the house for the first time in a week today to see my therapist and I asked her for something to get rid of the mental pain, she said no. All I feel is pain, I can't even remember the last time I smiled. I can't take the pain and I don't want to feel anything. ",07Dec2018,1
4,"Everything is fuckin dandy

I’m shaking right now because I feel like an utter failure at everything I try. 
I go to university, go to the counselor, go to the gym, try and do hobbies that keep me grounded. I go to the tutors when I need help in school

But ya know what? Non of that matters because I still feel like shit every time I get misgendered (trans guy). I hate that I even have to bring up that I’m trans here. It’s not that I don’t like myself, I do, mostly. But I hate that I have to correct people when they use the wrong pronouns so often. It gives me panic attacks if I don’t. I try to be nice about it, but there’s always someone who says “oh well I identify as an attack helicopter” or calls me a bitch and I hate it so much. Some of the professors try to help and bless their souls but they can’t stop the persistent misgendering that drives me mad. I understand why logically but I almost broke a window the other day by smashing my head into it because I can’t take it anymore. 
I’m failing most of my classes, though so it might not even matter. I study the most I can while dealing with all the anxiety but I never seem to get anything higher than a C in any of my classes and it’s so disheartening to try your best, and keep getting knocked down.  
I hate that my parents don’t support me, and I know the only way to be honest with myself is to leave home, but I can’t leave home if I can’t get a job. I’ve applied to 15 different places in the last 3 months and haven’t gotten a word back. 
I started writing books, but they don’t sell, and now I’m doing surveys online to get some money to move out. To get some money to transition and change my legal name. To get some money and attend university again without all the fuss.

all this to just survive.
It’s disheartening, man.

I’m not going to lose, but I’m not sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Start with 8 minutes per day, and work your way up from there.  

&amp;#x200B;

How to meditate: 

1) Sit down with eyes closed. 

2) Focus your attention onto your breath leaving the nose.

3) If you lose focus, return your attention back to the sensation of the breath. 

4) Repeat daily!  If thoughts, feelings or other mental phenomena arise, gently acknowledge them and return to the breath.  T

his is the act of meditation, the returning of focus to the breath, not ‘emptying your mind’  

FAQ:  

Eyes closed or open, how do I sit?  

It doesn’t matter, find a posture that works for you - keeps you focused and awake, but not in pain.  

&amp;#x200B;

When? 

First thing in morning is recommend, but it doesn’t matter as long as you are consistent.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is this religious? 

No. There is nothing religious about observing your breath.

6,"I was raised in a very close family. My parents are still married. They have been loving and supportive of me (36) and my sister (34) our whole lives. My sister has always had quirks (exagerating, white lies)  but they were something we just wrote off and ignored when she was younger. She lived with me for 6 years and during that time she gave birth to my nephew (4) and became a single mother. I sold my house last year to move closer to the city and she had to move back in with my parents because she hasn't been able to support herself.

In the last two years her behavior has escalated to the point that it is no longer managable. She has violent outbursts (usually aimed at my 60 year old mother) almost daily. The root of the problem is that she has repeatedly gotten herself into a bad fiancial situation and we are no longer bailing her out with cash. When I offered to help her budget she says I'm trying to control her life but she calls me at least once a week begging for money. If I say no she calls me awful names and says I don't care about her or my nephew. She makes up rideculous things all the time to blame for all of her problems. Example...She told everyone that my parents paid for my college and wouldn't pay for hers. She didn't want to go to college and I graduated with the student loans to prove my parents didn't pay. At first I thought she was just entitled and spoiled but now I realize she believes these lies she tells and can't control herself.

We attemped family therapy but she wasn't willing to take any responsibility and actually had delusions that the therapist blames us for her problems. I have tried every way I can to reach her but she is paranoid and has no concept of reality. At this point I don't want to be involved in her life at all until she seeks help but I'm worried about my parents and my nephew. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any resources out there for dealing with a family member that refuses to seek help?

 So far she hasn't hurt anyone but I'm scared she will.",07Dec2018,1

14,"so this is about ptsd.

so i had a surgery a few days ago, and it shook me up pretty bad. i didn't wake up in the middle or anything, it was just the experience. i went to the hospital, and looking back i seemed to focus on things other than the surgery. i was focusing on the cool things that the hospital had in the lobby, and the neat design, until i was led to the room. in there i just sat and did what the doctors asked of me. eventually they led me to a room with a machine and they put a mask on me that makes me breath in a gas. and i hated it. just in a few seconds i started getting blurry vision, and then my body just flashed into numbness till i couldn't hold onto the mask, and the doctors held the mask onto me and i started laughing and feeling like crying and i wanted them to stop. they weren't suffocating me i could breath just fine, and i have had this done to me before. this is just more when my mind can remember better. then i just went to sleep while i was trying to say that i didn't want this. i didn't have a dream, or a nightmare. then i woke up and my front teeth were gone, because they were surgically removing my teeth to give me fake ones. and since then i just couldn't sleep that well. on the nights leading up to this i woke up early and slept late, and even now, afterwards i sleep late and wake up early. last night i had a panic attack, just from trying to eat a popsicle, and now two of my favorite songs make me shake and put me on the verge of crying when i hear them because it reminds me of that moment. it was just so sudden. it was just blurry vision, darkness, and then blurry vision and some of my teeth were gone. i am shaking uncontrollably now just thinking about it. i honestly hate this, and i now just get scared and panicky over this just from being reminded of one small thing, or hearing those two songs and popsicles make me start slowly crying now..

i have acted differently too. i have been more pissed off, and irritable. i have had small fits of fear over people walking up to me for some reason?? and i am just way more reckless, and i care less about things i need to do.

this probably isn't ptsd, and if it isn't then can someone help me? i am going to go to a therapist eventually but not yet. not until i know that this is not normal, and that i probably need help.",07Dec2018,1

For months I have been trying to get in with someone, fighting my insurance and trying find a doctor who would be a good fit. It was beginning to weigh on me, exacerbating my bouts of depression.

I feel as if a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I got to dump all the mental garbage I've been carrying around, to someone who actually understood why I was carrying it.

I waited going this long out of fear of being told I had something wrong with me. It was completely irrational.

About a year and a half ago i started playing an old guitar i had since i was a kid but never learnt to play it. I didn't tell anyone I'd gotten into it, the guitar had been collecting dust under my bed for years, so nobody really remembers i have it. I feel that because nobody knows i play it, im not under pressure to do well or actually be good. I started learning it through Youtube tutorials on my own at night when I'm left in peace. I find it calming because nobody is expecting me to be amazing, and yea - of course i see people who can play better than me but i dont really care about that because nobody knows that i can play a D chord let alone play some parts of different songs, so in a way im already better than they expect hahah!

  


The point I'm trying to make is find a new hobby that interests you, and don't tell anyone, because then you're doing it purely for yourself and nobody else.

Co-workers are always trying to move up to better positions and planning their future family lives.

The past few days he has been very affectionate over text, wishing we were hanging out, wanting to cuddle, etc,. We have been seeing each other every now and then but it’s been about 2 weeks since the last time.

“I know I was known to lie in the past, and even extend the truth. But I am working on that, and I am telling you the honest truth” 

I want to believe him and begin to trust him again. But I don’t want to get too excited or let my guard down. He hasn’t really outwardly acknowledged his lying before, or that he was “known” to do it.

I feel like an asshole when I'm frustrated with my friends or acquaintances when they expect to get much better without doing the work or while surrounding themselves with the same drama. ""If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten ,"" or something to that effect. 

Change is possible. But you have to be the one to make the decision. Someone else can give you all the reasons why it would help if you did this or that. But you have to be the one to change. 

And the fact that *I* can't help/make someone change is so frustrating to me. Because I know how much better it is on the side of wellness.

  Is this normal? Right now in bed (my house is quiet) the ringing got loud, and so I started playing a track of an ocean next to me. Now the ringing is quieter but I also hear static (which I experience when I’m about to faint).

40,"Backstory; I’ve dealt with depression since I was about 13years old. When it first began I hid it and self harmed. Somehow I got “out of it” but not really. I masked it I guess, it always being there but never making an appearance. Recently, the past couple years it has been showing up a lot more. Had a emotionally/psychologically abusive relationship which ultimately amplified it all. I left this relationship for another and thought I was better but my emotions got worse. This relationship is so loving and I think that’s why everything is coming out now, that I have someone I can rely on and take care of me. I current am living with depression, suicidal ideation and a borderline eating disorder.  

Yesterday was a very hard day. I’ve been waiting a little while to get a letter to go on leave from work, and today was kinda the deadline I needed it by. Yesterday I was extremely overwhelmed by the thought of not getting this letter. I desperately need a break from everything and this is my only chance. I was alone for three hours crying and dealing with it on my own. I used to self harm when I was younger, dealing  with depression, I have stoped for years. Yesterday I didn’t harm but I kept scratching myself with scissors, some control it felt like. Later that night in bed I told my SO how much I need more help and how I’ve been feeling and how it’s been getting so much worse. I sobbed for hours inconsolably.

I’ve tried to stop but I always end up doing it again without even realizing because it’s become such an ingrained habit for me. I’ve never told anyone else about this before because honestly I just feel deeply ashamed about it and I feel like anyone I tell would judge me harshly and be disgusted.

I was also evaluated in the ER once or twice and released basically right away because I wasn't bad enough, but I hate that it happened at all and wish I hadn't called for help or told anyone how I was feeling.

I'm crying just thinking about it because I just feel like I will never, ever overcome these issues. I feel like they will always be in front of me and never behind. I feel like such a weak, bad person, like it'd be better if I had committed a crime than have these issues.

I want to be a police officer someday, it's a big dream of mine that I had since before I got depression.

For the sake of trying though I guess I will do what my therapist said and acknowledge how far I've come...

46,"I feel like I'm screwed right now. I feel I'm not that smart and won't pass highschool.

  


School has always been hard for me. I have social anxiety and find it extremely hard to go to school. In elementary I managed to go, and got great grades.

  


Middle school though was quite harder, and different. I was not able to get myself to go to school. For the first bit I could not get myself in. To help this I was placed into this special program thing where I would see myself spending my day in a small room with a teach and a couple other kids where I could complete all of my work apart. For grades 7 and 8 I did that. And while it did help my attendance I did not learn as much.

  


For grade 9, instead of going to highschool we tried a different type of school that was part online and attendance would be only required a couple day of a week. Unfortunately that did not work for me and my education feels somewhat incomplete.

  


Despite my below average education I found myself braving up and taking my first year in high school, grade 10. Due to my education history I was placed into the ""lower classes"". And I'll be honest with you. They were easy. Despite being so easy I saw how all of the other classes were doing much more advanced stuff and it felt like we were doing grade 7 stuff. That hurt me a little seeing as to how I may never catch up to all of the normal kids.

  


Socially high school was a nightmare. Being placed in the special classes, and not being in high school for grade 9 absolutely hurt me socially. I knew no one, but everyone had known me as the kid in those special classes from middle school. I was not able to talk to anyone. This hurt me a lot.

  


As for attendance, I was doing quite well. September and October I managed to go, and not let the other stuff get to me. I did my work, stayed quiet and that was it. What happened was at the end of October, during Halloween there was this big social Halloween event that, let me just say was a horrid nightmare. It killed me inside. What happened made me want to have a breakdown. I managed to not have a breakdown, but it was hard. Since that event I have not managed to get back into school. I missed the entirety of November and this first week of December of school.

  
During this time I have became depressed and more anxious. I'm now locking myself in my room for the whole day. I really want to stop this but I can't. I have no idea how far back in school work I am, and I'm now scared that I won't understand what they are doing. I feel like my sister who is 2 grades lower than me is smarter than me. 

  


With all of this poor attendance and missing work I am now afraid that I may not even pass high school, which scares me, makes me more depressed, which in turn makes it harder to get back into school.

  


  


Part of my anxiety is talking to my parents. I have no idea how to tell them how anxious and depressed I really am. I don't know what to say to get help, and it feels like I'm trapped and won't pass high school. I fear that I may end up as some mc Donald's worker that spends his free hours locked in his decaying home, and the shit scares me.

A decade ago, my Father passed away, and in response the vultures came quick.  My extended family arrived from Idaho, and mind you most of them are staunch Mormons.  Well knowing how crushed I was, they manipulated me, and had me open my Dad's gun vault.  They took everything, over 6,000 USD in guns and ammo (handguns,M1A supersport rifle, ar15 etc), and then they took the safe itself.  So, sidestep one second, my Dad liked nice shit, needless to say that nice shit comes at a price.  And mind you, these guns were still registered to my Father, therefore they should of been my Mom's property, taking these firearms was multiple felonies all at once (the fucked up part is my uncle took a lot of it and he's in law enforcement, could getchya with a gun that might not even be registered).  So my extended family looks while me and my Mom get slapped my fathers debt, but that's chill because life insurance right?  RIGHT?!?!

Fuck.  Nope, my Father, the hilarious junkie he was (finding his dead body sent me into psychosis for ten minutes, I literally couldn't call 911 because I was having some crazy seizure/screaming/flailing around), had his life insurance money set to go to my uncle who was going to divide it up to help my half-siblings and I, but here's the big LDS Mormon catch, the money is for school, and getting married and starting a family.  So that was great, me and my Mom had to start selling anything we had of value, literally if it was worth 20 bucks or more we popped it on KSL (Utah's Craigslist), we still lost our house, had to move to an apartment, etc.  In the meantime, I'm incredibly screwed in the head from all the trauma and underhand manipulation.  Being so so depressed and edgy I try taking my life, mental ward (have tried 2 times, fucking belt broke one time and got busted trying to hang myself, ironically the cops that came to get me had their guns drawn, so I started screaming at them to just shoot me).  Through introduction of pills, big pharma at work destroying dat youth, and later on got into heroin and stuff.  My logic was that I hated everything, trusted nobody, and because my Dad was a junkie ill be one!!  I'm 25 and have never been in a relationship, and I never will.  Living on the streets in Portland, having to join up with a local gang called the SickBoys, shooting up into my neck.  And mind you, I'm a clean homeless, not a completely filth drenched one and I dont have any tracks.  So I go to the ER because I was extremely sick, was fighting off some MRSA and what felt like an insane level flu, like over 9000, I was throwing up like the bitch from the Exorcist except from both ends.  So at the hospital I wait in the ER for only 6 hours, then I get taken baxk, explain what's up and how I can't even drink water and hold it down, so they'll probably administer IV fluids to get my electrolytes back up...well nope, I heard the doctor and nurse talking, they know I do dergs so no IV because ill run with it, which is stupid as fuck, I know because my friend who misses a lot decided he NEEDED an IV, so he somehow fenegguls getting one.  His arm started getting infected in 3 days, when he went to the hospital for help they removed it and got him on his way to jail.  Sorry, waaaay sidetracked, but basically I am human trash, my ""family"", has abandoned me.

I still haven't seen any of that money for helping me in life, I even asked if he could just help me get a place or at least a car, no.  Money for what they took...no.

For a while now, my life revolves around research, researching my family...watching....waiting...that's the thing though.  To my family it was like swatting a fly and it was over, but what if the fly didn't die, what if his hollow heart filled with hate and rage.  Someday a man will beg me, and I will make him witness pure savagery.  Every detail, every perversion, ill gather every scrap I can get, and soon they will watch my beautiful performance, with tears in their eyes, they will finally understand what's happened.  Ill make them and their kin understand what they've done to me, ill make their children doubt them as they made me doubt my mother through manipulation.  And then my performance, the stage covered in red roses but no one clapping, will be finished.

If you read this far, thank you, because I'm always alone and mainly just make small talk with myself it means a lot to be able to send something out I wrote that people might read, I don't get to accomplish a lot so this is a win for me...my like, crowning achievement is I pay for my phone with bottles and cans, thank fuckin god for can/bottle recycling!!

60,"So my mom is diagnosed as schizophrenic 13 years ago when she first ""had"" it - claimed she saw the devil, kept staring at the sun/sky for hours (we suspect she’s trying to worship the god or something), and went to the church for hours. When one of her friends from the church came over to talk to me about how she had been acting strangely, she was chanting and praying the whole time in the living room. After the chat, we came out of my room and found she collapsed on the floor chanting. Panicked, we sent her to a hospital nearby and she stayed there for about a month. It didn’t work. And because we’re Catholic, my grandma found a priest specialized in exorcization, and he did some stuff to her. She was back to normal then. 

8 years ago she “had” it again but this time exorcizating didn’t work out for her. Sent her to her parents’ who live in the country (actually it was more like we forced her to because her brothers and sisters came and literally forced her out of our apartment). While staying there, her parents took her to a church every day and they had been visiting a psychiatrist regularly. Couples of months later, they said she was well and stable and sent her back.

Once she came back home, we took her to a psychiatrist in town and she’d been visiting him regularly to get her meds. During the 8 years, she has actually tried a few times to go off meds, claiming that she was back to “normal"" and didn’t need any meds. My family and I talked to her a lot about this and even tried to force her to swallow the meds. It worked ok until recently.

Weeks ago we got a mail from the clinic she went to, saying that she had missed her last session. It’s only then we realized she hasn’t been taking her meds. About two weeks ago my dad, my sister, and I have, respectively, caught her staring at the sun/sky through the windows in our living room/ her room. When asked, she simply said she didn’t do anything and tried to brush us off. 

Not only that, she’s been doing some really weird stuff like cleaning our wall crucifixes which is something she hadn't done in ages. We’re worried sick about her and afraid she might not come home one day. Told her parents about how she’s been acting lately and they want to send (force) her to their home and live with them for a while to see if it helps. I don’t know if it helps, but we’re dying for a way to get her to a psychiatrist and on meds again.

61,"Hi, I’m 25 and gonna try to keep this short but probably fail. I have only been officially diagnosed with OCD and much of my treatment (currently just therapy) is focused on that because it can be severe. I have not been treated for anything else.

I suspect I have Bipolar II but don’t wanna say I have it. The textbook symptoms have always been something I’ve experienced even as a kid.

I have always been “spaced out” even as a child. I don’t remember being present a lot. I didn’t always feel connected to my body. A lot of times I don’t feel like I’m walking, but rather “floating”. Feels like I experience a lot of things through a sheet of glass. I find it hard to focus on anything for more than 5 minutes. Bump into people when I’m walking and not realize. I’m better lately, because I’ve been actively trying to deal with this. 

I suffered a mental breakdown a few years ago due to OCD and depression, was hospitalized, my brain was very weird for a few years, and now it’s kind of back to its normal self and I am experiencing things that seem familiar to me (good and bad), from before my breakdown.

I had what you’d probably call a mixed episode (what I’m calling it just for now) for a week. Up and down. Completely hopeless for an hour, then hyper beyond belief. Rinse and repeat. This went on for a week, ending yesterday. I was exhausted physically even though I slept 8 hours a night. I cried a lot because the rollercoaster was frustrating to deal with. Some days I’m like this, but not to this extreme and not for this long.

I felt like I was losing my mind. I would think I did something, then I felt like I really did do those things, even if I didn’t. I think this is an OCD thing. Reality seemed weird and unreliable. That is also an OCD thing but it was a little different this time.

Yesterday I went to a 6 hour drawing class. Tired and out of it, but trying to do my best. Toward the end of it I was “spacing out” but very very badly. I am an artist and a writer, so I have characters I kind of project myself onto when I want to cope with things but it’s usually something I do for like a creative reason. Not a big deal. But yesterday I felt like I was in a character’s room. I was feeling the ground and the walls. I didn’t feel like I was physically in my classroom. I kept saying things to myself about the room my mind was in, like “I’m in a room. The walls feel like this, the air smells like this”, etc.. it was uncomfortable. I guess I would do this though because I was tired of feeling the episode I was going through that whole week? Yesterday I was very mentally worn out from the ups and downs.

When I “snapped” out of it because someone was talking too loud next to me, I was 1) irritated and 2) confused. I stared at my paper and didn’t feel like I was physically here. I walked out of the classroom. The “floating” sensation became extreme to the point where it was uncomfortable. I was weirded out by my reflection in my phone when I tried to fix my hair. 

Went back to the classroom and stared at the paper again. Eventually I started drawing random stuff but it didn’t feel like I was drawing it, I felt like I was watching someone else draw. I was impressed by how well it looked. It felt like an understanding of art that I did not possess for a long time now.

Anyway I feel completely fine today, which kind of weirds me out. I feel physically grounded and confident in my actions. I feel unusually well. My hourly ups and downs just kind of stopped. It seems weird now, like it wasn’t a big deal. But yesterday I was kind of scared? I didn’t even tell my partner because I didn’t know what was going on. This feeling of “spacing out” to this extreme seemed familiar to me, like I’ve done it before but I can’t think of a specific time I did that, if I did.

I have no experience with dissociation. I talked to my therapist about this today but it isn’t her area of expertise and she didn’t seem concerned when I told her. I don’t really know if I’m overreacting or making a big deal out of it. I tell myself I’m just creative. But I don’t know some days. 

When I have bad mental days, I always forget how much they affected me right after it’s done. Like “oh, that was silly, I don’t need help”. But I really did feel uncomfortable experiencing that. Is there a way to read up on something like this so I can get more info? Thanks for reading.",07Dec2018,1

This is going to pretty much cover my life story, so it will be extremely long.  


The question in the title doesn't come for a very long time.

  


  
When I was in elementary school, I did pretty normal things. I went out and played with my friends, we had sleepovers, I played sports, video games, watched TV, got good grades and had a loving family. However, I wasn't a completely normal kid, I was very interested in animals and psychology from a very early age, I'd often borrow encyclopedias from the library, whilst all of my friends would read fiction like normal kids. But one day in 6th grade, I went to my friends place, and we played Minecraft on his Xbox and had a lot of fun. Later that year, after saving up pocket money and Christmas/birthday money for ages, I finally bought the laptop I really wanted. I could then play games with all my friends who played on their computers. Before I knew it, it turned out to be a good **hobby,** it wasn't just an activity anymore, anyway I continued living as normal, but i'd just play on my laptop in my free time. Now, I wouldn't go so far to say that I was addicted, I continued to play sports and hang out with friends, until I met someone at my sports carnival, he was pretty cool and we had a lot in common. We started talking a lot at school after that and pretty much became best friends. We would play video games at home (online) and soccer at school, eventually, we started getting really good at the games and started making ""friends"" on said video games. Throughout the last few months of this happening, I hadn't talked to any of my friends outside of school, this ""best friend"" of mine, not ONCE did we see each other outside of school or school related activities. We'd play for hours online after school and still talk on the mic, but it's just not he same. In saying that, 7th grade came along. Everything just seemed bland all of a sudden, remember how I said that I was interested in psychology? I always had this kind of curse, although most people would say that it's a gift. Most of the time I can tell when people are lying or manipulating to get their way etc. But, when i was younger, and would call the other kids out on it, they would just deny it and I didn't push them because I wasn't confident in my abilities. But once I got into 7th grade, I was more confident, I could tell just how often people lied, deceived and manipulated others, this is in 7th grade, where most of the students are around 12 years of age. This made me not want to be friends with them anymore, I couldn't stand being in this superficial environment anymore, I was overcome by anger and sadness, I always thought, why am I different? Why can't I be like the other kids and JUST BE NAIVE and ignorant? My brain felt some sort of block, suddenly my grades dropped, I couldn't think clearly, concentrate, and I couldn't study at all, I was completely and utterly demotivated. I started coming home to my parents and talking about how the other kids aren't good people etc (some of them really weren't). I would constantly give them valid reasons as to why the other students are doing wrong. And halfway through 7th grade, I left. I left the school to look elsewhere for friends who genuinely care about each other, to venture out into the loving world, that I always heard about, when my parents told me that, it only seemed like half of a lie, so I wanted to believe them. My parents transferred me to another school mid year, mid term, mid week, I transferred as early as they'd allow us. Once I got there, I knew someone in my soccer team, and he helped me around the school etc. At this point, I still played with that friend from my old school online. He was the only friend I had. Although this friend who was showing me around the school, did become my friend rather quickly. The more I knew about how people thought in contrast to how they react to situations, I suddenly didn't want to make friends that seemed fake. It became abundantly clear that it wasn't just my old school, society itself is superficial and self driven. I would see these genuinely nice kids be treated poorly and it just made me sad. It got to the point where I had social anxiety, this was VERY bad and would change my life for the worse. I would ignore people, or just reply in a very shy manner. In elementary school I was a pretty assertive person in general and didn't let people walk all over me. My grades also didn't change, they were appalling along with my concentration and motivation to work. 8th grade came along and as I phased out of the new kid stage, people started to make fun of me, of my overwhelming shyness, like something they've never seen before. I wouldn't even answer questions in class, even if I knew the answer. However the way people would make fun of me was very interesting to me, the majority of the people who made fun of me, were the girls. And, of course, it was the extroverted ones, they would come up to me in groups and and say hello, oh, they might just be nice girls? No, the way they said was often satirical and it was blatantly obvious to me, but not really anyone else, people knew they genuinely didn't care but they thought it was just to be polite. The thing that was interesting is that, I don't think any of them came up to me when they were by themselves, that confirmed it, they just wanted to get a laugh out of each other. I did the classic after this kept happening, when I got to school everyday, I'd just avoid where they usually hang out and then I was fine for that part at least. People would often ridicule me by bringing me up in their conversations like ""Oh, yeah! He's my boyfriend, I love him!"". There was one girl who was apart of another group who did it, she was the one who started doing it, however at the start, It sounded sincere, which made me happy, however I still brushed it off in the same way as others saw me, just smiled, sometimes said it back quietly and then moved on. I don't know if that offended her or not, and I feel bad, but that's just how it happened. However, she kept saying it, it became less and less sincere every time, although it was annoying, I didn't really mind, because I could see it in her eyes that she had some personal problems, I was pretty sure it was depression, but I decided that it was none of my business. So I just didn't mind when she did it, maybe it helped her in some way, at least she was laughing. This became less and less frequent for people to do that as time went on, I knew that would happen which is why I let it go on for a while instead of making a fuss. During 8th grade, I quit soccer, my motivation to do anything was just completely gone. However, it wasn't all bad, there were times where I decided to look past some people when they lied, and just accepted it, so I ended up making some new friends to hang out with at school. As this went on, I stopped talking to the one from my old school and cut ties completely. At this point I had two main friends, they were pretty nice to hang with every once in a while and talk to, they're still my friends to this day, I never did explain to ANYONE (still haven't) why I was so shy, my true outlook on the world and society. It got to the point where the only things I somewhat enjoyed was talking to my friends and playing video games at home. Although, I wasn't enjoying my time on my computer as much as I used to, I kind of just played on it because it was one of the only ways that I could enjoy myself. At this point my thinking still felt like it was blocked by something,  like almost as if my intelligence is trying to get out but something is blocking it. Whenever people meet me, they talk about how I must get really good grades etc. But when I tell them that I barely pass most of the time, they get really surprised. I have random outburst of, I wanna say genius in three main areas specifically. Deductively, strategically and psychologically, people are amazed when this happens. I can't help but think if I could properly harness my brain and think properly, I could be like that all the time. Once 9th grade comes along, I think that that is when I noticed that I was also suffering from depression and also generalised anxiety. The anxiety came from a very personal problem, it was a traumatic experience for me, but wouldn't have been for most. It almost felt like paranoia, I was having nightmares pretty frequently too, having those nightmares would've had to have been one of the worst portions of my life. As for the depression, I honestly don't know how it came to be, maybe a mix of my lifestyle and my worldview. My motivation was an all time low, I would still come to school but I hated it, I hated exercising, or leaving the house when it wasn't absolutely necessary. After a while of me acting with such shyness, there became a joke that shouldn't have been taken lightly. I started being called a school shooter VERY VERY frequently, multiple times daily. This was due to my expression-less, depression-ridden face and the fact that i'm skinny, quiet and have blond hair. However these kids, they didn't know that I was going through anything, they thought that that was just me. I would often completely ignore it or nervously laugh along with it (although I didn't think that it was ever funny whatsoever). No one could see that it was affecting me at all, however I did tell them to stop a few times with the justification of ""This is getting old, is it honestly that funny"". It got to the point where days after a school shooting happened it America (I live in Australia), people would make jokes like ""Wow, you made the flight back over here real quick"" or something along the lines of that. Once there was a lock down out our school and people made the obvious generic jokes once again. I've never been a sensitive person to begin with, so it was more of a nuisance than anything, honestly. If anything, I was happy that I was the one being targeted, and not some frail kid who would self harm or something. I never really thought about self harming or anything myself, but I did often think ""I genuinely wish that I don't wake up tomorrow"" hoping that I could randomly go into some endless slumber. 10th grade came along, and it got to the point where I hated feeling confined due to the other students, they'd often be really unnecessarily loud in class, gossip about others and in general make my concentration even worse, bear in mind I used to be able to get A's at school whilst talking frequently with other students, being able to memorise and apply what I've learnt perfectly. But now, I'm not even close to being like that. In the first quarter of the year, I made some more friends (The school that I moved to in year 7 is a grade 1-12 school). I decided to try Fortnite, the game that everyone was talking about and really enjoyed it and got really good at it. I am almost a professional currently. After me constantly finding ways to get out of extracurricular activities at school, i'd decided that feeling of being confined, disliking the superficiality in the world and despising the extracurricular activities, I decided that maybe it's time to try something completely new. I decided to go and do online schooling, that way I can manage my own schedule, work at my own pace and only have to deal with the people who I truly want to interact with. My grades have improved a little bit, but that's only due to the stress relief of not being at school all the time, my anxiety had dropped drastically. My social anxiety is better because I don't have to interact with superficial people as frequently. My depression is very inconsistent, sometimes it feels like its dissipating, other times I feel like garbage. **Right now, I am currently finishing up 10th grade of online schooling, and I like it much more than any of the other two schools that I attended. However, right now I am having a bit of an identity crisis, I hate superficiality, and I also hate that I, myself am expected to display it in certain situations. I agree, sometimes it is necessary, but no where near as much as people use it. I am a pretty boring person now, however deep down i'm not bad, I like to think i'm actually a nice person who can be gentle at times. The thing is, this emotionless person, it's who I am, when people say be yourself, that's me. When I say emotionless, I don't mean it, I experience emotions just like everyone else, but mine are dampened a bit, and I don't like displaying them. Now, how much do you think that these experiences affected my intelligence? I definitely think that I lost a whole lot of potential, and I am furious about that. I need to know why I get the feeling that I'm not using my brain to its fullest, I can't, I also can't explain this 'blocking' it's just when I am about to arrive at an answer that, it just makes me lose my train of thought and then i'm useless for a bit. Not to mention my appalling motor and practical skills. The only thing special about me, the thing that I am supposed to pride myself in, is my brain. But it just doesn't work like I want it to, so I feel useless. I am still lacking tremendous motivation and all I want is to either be able to properly think, absolutely clearly or be ignorant. After all, ignorance is bliss. One thing that might be worth mentioning is that my brain feels a little clearer when my adrenaline is pumping, I feel less stiff in general and happier.  Right now I am sitting at home for weeks at a time, no motivation to do anything, yet bored. I also don't want a generic future, I want to be able to find my talents and put them to use, if possible i'd love to be able to use my potential in deduction, strategy, and psychology as a career, but I don't know what career that would involve and I won't be cut out for it unless my brain is completely free for my use. Anyone know if this brain problem even exists or if it permanent? please.....**",07Dec2018,1
63,"My perspective on life has changed a lot lately, and I haven't been feeling like myself. Growing up was hell and my young adulthood was my little slice of heaven, but unfortunately I've found myself in purgatory. I feel like the best years of my life were spent and continue to be spent uselessly. I haven't been making any progress on becoming the person I want to be. In fact, I'm barely skating by adulting and it's always been that way no matter what age I've been. I constantly find myself *struggling.* Struggling to get by emotionally, physically and financially. I'm exhausted, even when I do the bare minimum. And now I feel like I'm living a meaningless life and my existence means relatively nothing in the broad spectrum of things. I'm tired all the time, yet I somehow manage to put on a face that I'm well and prospering when I am 100% not. 

As for my death phobia, I'm getting a little bit better with the exception of creating a dead man's switch account and adding new songs to my future funeral playlist. Oh, and tonight I painted a kinda morbid painting but I really like it and want to add to it later but it's drying right now and there's no gore or anything so I might post it but I definitely won't be showing it to my friends or family, they worry about me enough.

Speaking of which, my mother showed up not once but twice unexpedly this week, so that's always nice. I think a lot about moving back with her because I love her and I really miss her, and on top of that I'm constantly worrying about her getting sick or dying. She painted a canvas one of the times and suggested I add to it, but I don't think I will. She can add to it on future visits but I want it to be something I can always keep and treasure from her in case of emergency.

I got put on a new medication and saw a psychiatrist. It went well but they were rather boring, and not discreet about asking questions leaning towards certain mood disorders that I know for a fact I don't suffer from. New med is way better than the last stuff which I absolutely hated because it just made my nightmares longer and more vivid. I was feeling extremely paranoid at night and sometimes I still do. Nights are just hard for me. For one, I feel more energy, whereas during the day I feel half asleep and can often take a nap or two. Can't get myself to sleep at a decent hour though, and can't drag myself out of bed in the morning. Going out and about is really hard some days, so I try to be really hygienic to make myself feel like I've at least accomplished something. 

Lastly, I feel the biggest disconnect I've ever felt between my mind and body recently. I don't know how to explain it, but when I speak and express myself or it's just me and my thoughts I don't see myself in my head as I appear in the mirror. Sometimes I catch glimpses of this person in my eyes or in various angles, but I don't look how I think I should in the mirror. I wonder if I expect to see myself younger or older than I really am. I hate looking down at my slender arms and bony wrists. These body parts remind me of skeletons (which I hate, and is the main issue here) and make me feel like I have a weak appearance. It doesn't help when family likes to remind me of how skinny I am every time I see them. I have no eating problems, I've always been underweight, but it has never really bothered me much until now. I feel like my appearance causes people to perceive me as stupid and immature. I feel like my outer age causes people to try and take advantage of me as well. It's happened a lot and it sucks. I feel ages don't even really matter because you could die at 21 or you could die at 56, or anywhere in between, you could even die tomorrow, unfortunately. Although at my age, for how 'together' I appear to be, I feel it's a ridiculous standard for one to have to have all shit figured out at my age, when not long ago I was considered a child. But yeah, enough rambling from me. I hope this stage passes soon.",07Dec2018,1
64,"My wife is very smart. She is a doctor. She is also driving me crazy. She rips out her eyebrows, eyelashes, and genital hairs and eats them. She does it for hours a day, every day. She won’t admit it to anyone, even her psychiatrist or her psychologist. She comes home telling me things like, “My psychiatrist tells me I am doing great and is lowering my dosage of X.” I finally asked her today if she told anyone about her hair and she said no. She gets upset if I even mention it. She does it like a zombie and acts like she doesn’t even know she does it. The few times I’ve called her on it, she says something like, “It’s a compulsion! I can’t change it!” Meanwhile she constantly gets mad at me for every single thing I do, so I have a laundry list of things I’ve *stopped* doing, like biting my nails and even drinking alcohol. She also picks her nose constantly, like seriously to the point I think she is going to hurt herself. Lastly, she picks on herself and on me. She will hold me down and pick on me, she constantly carries tweezers around and picks at herself. Instead of sleeping, she sits on the couch with her iPhone flashlight ripping out hair, skin, etc and eating it until like 4AM. Then on her days off she will sleep until like 3 PM. It is so disgusting and makes me so mad because she spends so much time getting furious at me for not losing weight, and I’m not even that overweight and work out *every day* hard, like an hour of weight training. She gets furious that my skin isn’t perfect. It’s just so extremely hypocritical that I want to scream at her or walk out the door or worse walk in front of a bus because I feel like there is no escape from her psychosis. I am bipolar and it is hard for me to keep my life together, and her constant belittling of me while sitting there eating her hair and picking her nose does not help me. I have no idea how to approach this because she lords her 3 degrees over me and treats me like an imbecilic child, so anything I do or say is wrong by default. Any ideas? It literally makes me sick to my stomach. I can smell her hands which smell like genitalia or mucus when she touches me. It is revolting. I’m in Oregon. ",07Dec2018,1

67,"Hey, 

so lately i’ve been having thoughts. intrusive ones, but more on like thoughts that just come in and make me feel bad and doubt who i am and what I believe in. Some are wildly inappropriate as well and it disgusts me my mind can come up with such things, while some just make me doubt things I knew and were sure of prior to these thoughts coming. 

I know they’re not true and they’re not me but at the back of my head, my mind is always nagging me it might be actually true because I thought of it (even though I never wanted the thoughts in the first place) 

What’s worse is that I can’t sit still or pass it up and ignore and I do make it worse by engaging with the thought. I red an advice you just gotta let it invade your head but don’t engage at all? I don’t know how that works. 

Usually ranting and venting about these thoughts with my mom and my so, helps because I also get reassurance but the thing is its affecting my relationship with them especially one doubting intrusive thought is about my so. 

I dont want to say specifically what these thoughts are as Im only comfortable sharing them with people close to me but I just need to know what can I do? How do I distract myself or better yet, make it be forgotten? 

How do I calm myself as well when It feels like i have to vent it to someone but I don’t want to tell them as well because it might ruin the relationship? And please, am I the only one having these problems? ",07Dec2018,1

Hi :) 

So a bit of background info I have generalised anxiety disorder and specific phobia diagnoses and my GP thinks I may have some OCD and disrupted eating issues as well. 

Firstly I have seen 3 psychologists that are paid and I have seen a therapist at a free service run by the government, however, I haven't really found any of them useful and I feel discouraged because I'm beginning to think therapy isn't actually helpful and a waste of time and money. My GP thinks that I need to go see an experienced clinical psychologist who specialised in CBT and anxiety related issues because I have more than one main problem and my case is complex but I can't afford that so I'm stuck with the free service atm. 

I just wondered if anyone has actually found therapy helpful for serious mental illness and actually thinks its worth it? 

I'm especially discouraged as I'm currently in uni studying to become a clinical psychologist, however because of these doubts and other things I have been reevaluating my career goals and am planning to apply for medical school and become a neurologist in the next few years, but I really care about mental health however because of my own experience with therapy I don't know if I want to be a psychologist anymore if its useless because I want to use my skills and time to significantly improve or help peoples quality of life and health. 

What do you guys think?

Thanks. ",07Dec2018,1

Therapists is where I get a little confused. Is that the same as a psychologist here? I ask because I go to my psychologist for talk therapy so I’ve been interchanging these terms in comments. And if I have been using them wrong I’d like to stop doing so.

77,"Hello everyone. This is my first post and I know it is a bit long, but I really need your opinions.

I have history of childhood and adulthood trauma and a long history of mental illnesses. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, panic attacks, depsession to major depression then to bipolar disorser, and recently depersonalisation/derealisation disorder. 

Lately I have been having experiences that I cannot explain:

My body functions (I might be walking, talking, etc.)  but as I do what I do, I ""come out of it"" for a moment, and feel like a wave passing through my brain. In these brief moments I forget who I am, what I am doing, and then I ""come back to myself""  slowly. This symptom overlaps with the symptoms of frontal lobe epylepsy, which worries me a lot.

One time we were having a heated argument with my husband about my trauma and I felt like a part of me ""went inside"" and another part ""came out"". This part was masculine and loved my husband dearly, but like a brother. I was myself the whole time but felt differently, if that makes sense.

Another time I got in my car that I've had for the past 2.5 years and needed to use the mirror by the driver's seat. Then I thought to myself I don't know where the mirror is, because this isn't my car. 

Sometimes words come out of my mouth that I didn't intend to say.

Sometimes I find clothes in my closet that I didn't buy and have clothes that disappear for good.

I have conversarions and experiences with people and when they refer to them, I don't remember at all at first, and then later vaguely remember them but not in detail. I felt ashamed a lot of times because of this.

I doze off a lot. Sometimes so much so, that I feel like I come back to myself from very deep. 

I don't lose time, at least I don't remember if I do. I don't wake up in places I don't remember getting to. I always seem to be myself, but at different states of self. 

I will go to the doctor's for an epylepsy scan and I am seeing a new psychiatrist, but I haven't had the chance to talk about the DID symptoms. The symptoms of me coming out of it and coming back to myself sees her as a sign of my depersonalisation/derealisation but I am afraid it might be more. 

So do you think these are symptoms of DID? If so, how can I get my consciousnesses to communicate with me?

81,"I'm 23, and after many many long years of struggling with my mental health, I finally had a breakdown bad enough that my mother pushed me to see a psychiatrist. I have been on and off antidepressants since I was 17, but while they helped some symptoms, they did not help the most important ones and, sometimes I felt, made them worse. 

To summarise, I've suffered from incredible mood swings/extremes since I was a teenager. My average mood is incredibly low, and I'm liable to slip down into the deep dark at a moments notice, but I'm also liable to have periods of extreme energy and activity that eventually hit a peak of overwhelmed irritation and confusion. 

So far I've had two appointments with my psychiatrist, and both times I felt embarrassed and as if she was pushing me towards saying what she wanted to hear rather than what I felt. When we talked about my mood ""highs"" I explained to her that I do have unusually good moods, but at their peak they tend to overwhelm me and make me jumpy and incredibly irritable, and that I tend to  have irrational thoughts or make bad choices that at the time feel natural but later on I can recognise for being really fucking dumb. When we discuss this, she tries to push me into categorising it more... neatly, ignoring other major symptoms and twisting my words. 

After my first session she had be me research bipolar 2 disorder, and I was completely ecstatic to discover how well it fit how I felt. I have trouble verbally expressing my thoughts sometimes, but what I was reading really fit. During my second session, she told me she didn't feel I was bipolar after all, and she was leaning towards borderline personality disorder. 

I know she's the professional, but everything I've seen about BPD just... doesn't quite fit. A close friend of mine has BPD so I've seen some of the symptoms up close and it doesn't feel like me. This doesn't feel like a personality disorder. It feels like a mood disorder. I don't know how else to explain. She also asked if she could contact my mother and I gave full permission bcs I genuinely think it would be very helpful in her learning more about me, but it's been a month since our appointment, and our next one is closing in quick, and she hasn't contacted her. 

The town I live in is small. This woman is the only psychiatrist we have. I do not have the option of transferring. I have to make this work. I feel as if she's not listening to me, or trying very hard to squeeze my symptoms into very rigid boxes. My mental health has been even worse since I started these appointments bcs I'm no longer on any meds at all.

I'm sorry for the long spiel. If anybody has any suggestions for improving the situation (or suggestions for what I could be suffering from if I'm apparently not bipolar or BPD) I would greatly appreciate it. ",07Dec2018,1

I tried to be on disability, but was denied.. the only place that would hire me was a call center across the city.. i worked for a budget airline that could do NOTHING for anyone. I had people who’s family members died on vacation and I couldn’t give them a new ticket or flight or let them speak to a manager. Some calls would be 45 minutes, one time I almost cried cause this guy who just lost his mother was crying literally bawling his eyes out.. he said he had no money for a new ticket and misread the military time as 8pm. That’s stressful enough to tell him he’s gotta pay 709$ extra, but add on my ptsd and anxiety. My car is also not well on gas and is not maintained enough to sell, I’d be spending literally 30$ to make 85$ as buses literally do Not come from there. And if they did it would make my work day 13 hours. My worker laughed when I said I tried to commit suicide cause the stress of the job, I said “I bet I dealt with more stressful situations than you for less pay” I also wasn’t aloud to talk back and be rude. I’d have to sit there and take it 3 times before disconnecting.. they literally had 5 minute a day bathroom breaks.. I didn’t have ibs before working there, but all those stressful calls made my stomach churn. One week I had awful diarrhea and I took 8 mins a day for 40 hour work week and got called out for it.. I’m not a child I’m a grown man. They even have signs up saying “employees must wash hands!”..  if I’m timed like that maybe I’ll skip washing my hands.  Honestly there’s so much more in my life that sucks. I was smoking more weed at work cause of stress than I do at home. Literally every break and lunch id smoke about .5-2 grams  and on top getting alcohol after work. My eia worker berated me for quitting. I’d rather not go across the city to be called all sorts of names and pretend to be nice after what I’ve dealt with. Also my dad abused me sexually and I had to drive past his house to get to work, I’d literally have panic attacks at work if I didn’t have my medicated weed.

89,"I was medicated at the age of 12. I'm now 24. I've been on all different kinds of medication. Currently on Risperidone 2mg, and Mirtazapine 15mg. I got off of Cymbalta 7 months ago and was trying to get off all my medications. And then around October, I started feeling depressed.

My depression and sadness kept building up and up. And then Thanksgiving happened, and I was in horrible pain. NOTHING made me feel good or happy. Things that were enjoyable no longer felt enjoyable. I had a constant pain in my chest that would not go away which was anxiety. I felt horrible and being alive was very painful. I just didn't feel good. I couldn't focus or do anything except curl up in a blanket and watch television. I was in so much pain, I remember waking up in the middle of the night with extreme sadness and despair that I just could not explain. And waking up in the morning was very painful. I felt horrible vibrations through out. I just had extreme anxiety and a sense of impending doom and despair.

The pain was unbearable. I tried my hardest, but I decided to start taking Zoloft at 50mg. And in about 3 days, a majority of my pain and anxiety just melted away. The pain in my chest went away. I could finally focus now. I could go outside and do things. I felt happier and I could laugh again. I could visit my friends.

I talked to my psychiatrist, and she said that there was no cure for depression. And that I will probably be medicated for life.

Well, that kind of sucks. I thought that one day I would grow up and be able to be med free. But here my psychiatrist is saying I will probably be medicated forever. She is probably saying that because she wants money, I don't know.

My therapist says I'm not ready to come off of risperidone. And that it helps me focus.

I was hoping that if I did the work in therapy and changed my way of thinking, that I could be med free one day.

But, that pain I was experiencing during Thanksgiving. That felt like chemicals or something. I really have nothing to be sad about really. So maybe I was born with depression, I don't know.

When you have pain like that, where nothing is enjoyable and everything is painful, does that mean you need psych meds for life?

90,"Hi everyone,   


I am a licensed medical doctor and a contemporary artist.  
I have the following question for you :   
I would like to transition from working with walk-in patients in the clinic to working with fewer, yet more   
in-depths clients online.   
I would like to work specifically with artists and other creative-industry professionals ( or aspiring professionals ) who are struggling with mental health problems. I can offer quite specific advice and techniques for this set of clients and, being myself deeply routed in the underground art-scene of Berlin, Germany, have a unique set of experiences in it.   
I am just wondering whether you   
1. Think there is a need for this niche-service?   
Have you ever struggled with being understood as an artist within the more rigid framework of counseling for the general public?  
2. What service you would be most interested in using technically ? 

3. What issues are most pressing for you ? 

I am thinking about making most offers based on writing psychotherapy   
( e-mail / chats ) and potentially voice- and occasional video calls. 

I'd be glad to hear your input. 

Best,

Marc",07Dec2018,1

93,"Does any psychiatrist do any test of neurotransmitter levels or brain activity? 

Do they measure a single objective variable or even have a defined reference point for a 'healthy' brain and behavior?

 NO! In practice the purpose of psychiatry is labeling a person as 'badly behaved' and justifying that label with the appeal to authority bias. 

In practice psychiatrists are like priests who have replaced religious conformity with capitalist conformity, demonic possession with mental disorders, and exorcisms with prescription medication regimes.  

In practical Psychiatry is used to pacify a miserable working class, and chemically restrain children, not to improve anyone's quality of life. 

But here is the real DANGER of psychiatry: The very things that actually cause pathological behavior are often invalidated and ignored by applying a psychiatric diagnosis. Is a child angry about going to school? Instead of looking into the possibility of excessive social pressures, bullying, poor nutrition &amp; physical activity, or simple disengagement from the faculty who do the bare minimum to keep their underpaid jobs as being sources for a child's anger the psychiatrist applies the immutable stigma of ADHD or Autism or Bipolar. 

It is one thing to live in a society which breaks people through authoritarian &amp; economic abuse ; it is extra despicable to place the blame on the victims in the manner psychiatry does. The working class person &amp; their children face massive restrictions on their freedom of movement, speech, and even thought. US society places great burdens on us while offering little in terms of actual safety or hope. This might cause emotional &amp; behavioral problems; how many people need to have a mental health diagnosis before we say maybe something is wrong with the system instead of their brains?",07Dec2018,1

97,"Why do I feel like I have issues to connect with the world / my surroundings?
I feel like I'm living in a fog and don't care about my surrounding, feel emotional cold and have to fake my emotions a lot.  I think I have been like this since I can think.   
I am probably asexual and have issues to bind relationships and might have asperger traits but I'm not sure.   Maybe I'm depressed but I'm not sure.    I feel kind of empty most of the time, kind of bored, like I only live on the surface.   It's like living in a bored computer game.   Although when I go out, it's difficult to be enthusiastic and interact interested with my surrounding.   
I also don't have interests. 
   I do think maybe I'm not grounded and have to do mindfulness, but I'm not sure if that would help.   
  I also often feel more foggy when I drink alcohol, even with one drink.   I feel more detached then.     When I smoke weed, even with  one tiny hit, I have this weird mind fuck where I completely loose myself and not even know where I am and who I am and feel like being in a trap.

I also don't feel like going out.  There were times I felt slightly upbeat and wanted to do things with others but I rarely have these feelings anymore.   
The life doesn't have colors in my view. It's mostly kind of colorless but not in a depressed way, more like this joyfulness, happiness is not fully here.  

I don't feel depressed or sad or anything like that.  I feel detached or numb most of the time. I rarely cry anymore.  I do have some physical issues like high heart rate but maybe it's psychosomatic. 

Do aspergers do feel like that?  How could I get over it?  Antidepressants do make me feel more numb and foggy.    Maybe I should try another antidepressant? But I think that cannot be the answer especially because I am not depressed kind of.",07Dec2018,1

- I am nervous all the time. I have this weird feeling in my stomach like I'm on a rollercoaster. Sometimes I feel my heart beating really fast.

Now I'm like what's the point of all that misjudged sense of self-reliance when you've not got any well-being to play with anyway. I need to get myself back into work and earn a steady income so I can afford regular medication again.

All the best to all of you. [And a simpsons meme for good measure](https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsg3z7nPul1qfrrv2o1_1280.png)",07Dec2018,1
125,"Hi, I'll keep this as brief as I can.

I've been dating a girl for almost 2 years now, and throughout those two years we've had a few scraps purely because I can't trust her and I end up calling her out on things she never did.

Be it as small as lying about where she's been, lying about being asleep or anything else I just can't seem to be able to take her word sometimes.

It feels like I'm making it extremely hard for her to be with me, which in turn makes me think she's don't things she isn't doing. I'm not sure what to do anymore.

In all my previous relationships I've been cheated on, used or otherwise treated like less of a person by my partner, and I blame that largely on the group of people I assosiated myself with for many years so as to why I'm unable to trust I can kinda see, but I don't know what to do about it.

126,"I made a post on r/offmychest about it if you really want to know the context about how life has been until now. Long story short i feel really anxious(?) being surrounded by people, especially in my school. Most times its hard to even think normally and i cant concentrate fully. I feel alone, very alone, i feel like im worthless to everybody, and im so used to it that i cant even cry anymore. Every time i feel like the world is about to end i just start smoking and meaby drink until i calm down, sometimes i can even empty a box of cigarettes if i dont control myself. i dont know why and it even gets worse when i see people that hate me (or at least i think they do) sometimes when it gets really bad and i dont have cigarretes to cope with it i start to burn things or start pulling the pubic hairs of my legs, armpits and basically everywhere even tho it hurts. Recently its been so bad i come home from school or whatever and i just want to be left alone to die. I start twitching in my feet and shaking in my hands when anxiety kicks in and i cant let anyone show that im feeling bad. I really dont want to talk about it with anyone because i have a really bad time when talking about my problems,(and trusting people) and basically therapy is out of the question. ( ive had really bad experiences with talking to psychologists)

Meaby the answer is very simple for my problems but really im desperate to do anything to feel back to normal, without feeling like the world is about to explote in my brain. I just want to be myself again.",07Dec2018,1
127,"Yes, I'm angry at my parents. Reading about how some parents spent so much time and effort raising their children, and pushed them to grow and succeed, makes me jealous and upset. I'm looking for non-fiction books that talk about parents who didn't put much effort into raising their kids, and the effects and results of that. Bonus points for addressing parents who are ""checked out"" and absent, and sadistic siblings

I'd rather not have to read about children who were raised well and went on to success, but I suppose that's part of the territory.  Non-fiction please

Also, I should add that I'm not looking for books gratuitous physical abuse, rape, and the more macabre aspects of bad parenting. More along the lines of not being involved, not caring, being absent, irresponsible, emotionally distant, not nurturing, etc",07Dec2018,1
128,"I was diagnosed with major depression a couple months ago, but my medication stopped working completely and I'm back at square one. It's actually worse this time around. I'm thinking about bringing up how I'm feeling to my psychiatrist. Based on these things I've listed, what do you think he'll tell me? 

\- Extreme lack of motivation to do simple tasks (taking showers, brushing teeth). No motivation to complete schoolwork. 

\- Sleeping 14+ hours a day and still feeling tired. 

\- Impulsive and easily irritated by small things (such as certain sounds, people walking too slow, etc.) Throwing and hitting things whenever I become overwhelmed.

\- Easily annoyed by people, ignoring friends for several days. 

\- Barely caring about people. If one of my so called friends died, I wouldn't bat an eye. 

\- Easily forgetful, can't remember things I did or said days prior to them happening. 

\- Very bad self esteem and constant hatred for my existence. ",07Dec2018,1
129,"so context: i have bipolar disorder and ocd. i’ve gone through tons of medications over the years to (try to) alleviate the severity of my symptoms. 

now i have an amazing boyfriend. he’s everything i could ever ask for and so much more. and he’d absolutely stunning appearance-wise. to me he is the most beautiful person in the world. 

but being on so much medication over the last 5 years has essentially destroyed any semblance of a sex drive i had. it’s getting so frustrating because all i want to do is be able to be with my boyfriend but half the time my body or mind is so unresponsive i have to call it off. and that kills me inside. 

i’m going to ask my doctor about coming off one of my meds and switching some up to hopefully get back to normal. 

anyone else have this problem when treating their mental illnesses if you have one? let me make clear i’m medicated literally in order to live - this isn’t some mild anxiety i can take a low dose pill for. so please don’t suggest coming off my meds entirely. ",07Dec2018,1
