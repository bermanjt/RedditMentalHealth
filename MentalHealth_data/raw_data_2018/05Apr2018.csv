0,How common is it to develop serotonin syndrome if I take one buspirone while on my Lexapro meds? I take 10mg Lexapro every day and now I was prescribed buspirone by a new psychiatrist but I have heard some horror stories from mixing the two? Any experience/thoughts?,05Apr2018,2
2,"Everyday feels the same. I wake up, realize I still exist and that the events that happened to me are real, cry, take klonopin, sleep, etc.

I just got done with a trial where the man who sexually assaulted me was acquitted. I feel like I was traumatized all over again. I can't fucking believe he got away with it. On top of the PTSD for that, I have borderline PD, panic disorder, depression or bipolar (they've been trying to decipher for years due to antidepressants either making things worse or having no effect).

I've attempted suicide 5 times in the past two and a half years. If it weren't for me being 4 months sober, im sure I would've already been dead after this. 

I just feel stuck in this purgatory when I want to die but don't have the guts (alcohol made me impulsive and fearless). I'm in counseling 3 times a week and am on medication.

4,"I have depression/anxiety and they made my life difficult in most of my teen years.

Isolation and no social life didn't help either but right now I dealing with more stuff and idk what to do.

Months ago a guy messaged me here on Reddit and offered his help after reading one of posts where I ranted about my issues.

I accepted it and we started talking regularly on FB, we clicked on pretty well and we became friends.

The problem is that I developed a crush/infatuation for him and I ended up telling him at some point.

He said he wasn't interested in relationships and for him they are a waste of time etc but he said he still considers me a friend.

Recently we haven't talked so much (barely once 1-2 weeks) and I think he turned off my FB chat so he results to be offline (I am pretty sure, he got online only to reply a couple of times after 2 weeks but then he disappeared again).

The problem right now is that I cannot get him out of my head. I would like to keep the friendship but at this point I don't know if it's worth it at all (I am not sure if he wants to talk to me again though).

I keep thinking about him romantically and I am still crushing on romantically after everything, I am so tired so of feeling so stressed.

I vented a lot about my personal issues with him and he offered plenty of support during our convos, we shared similar ideas/values/interests and he also told him about a negative experience he had in the past (a girl he dated for a month and half cheated on him and let him know pretty directly). He refused to date since and he isn't into dating, I am pretty sure he has some trust issues or whatever.

I keep thinking obsessively why that girl influenced him so much (he said that she opened his eyes about relationships) even if he said he never felt anything serious at all.

I realised I feel jealous for someone I don't even know and it doesn't make any sense.

Idk how to deal with it, I try to think that it will go away or that I am able to avoid daydreaming/thinking about him but it's almost impossible...what can I do?

I am aware that this is an obsessive infatuation/crush due to loneliness and other issues but I need advice right now.

5,"I wanted to get everyone's opinion on something I haven't been able to shake.  I apologize for the lengthiness of this ahead of time, but I'm so perturbed about it I realized screw it, go big or go home.

I finally met a wonderful guy (yay!) in mid November 2017. He's SO kind that I almost disqualified him at the beginning because his niceness came off as overly strong, that I questioned how genuine it was.   With time, I came to see he comes from a very religious family, his father's a pastor, and the warmth he radiated was a byproduct of how he was raised. 

So things were and continue to be amazing but we had a tiff at the end of December and I can't seem to shake it even now, months later, EVEN with the help of my therapist. Here goes...

At the end of Dec he was with me late one night when he stepped away and left his phone behind. When it rang and a girl's picture popped up, I picked up. (Some background: he later explained before he met me, this girl and he had 1 date, they didn't even kiss, and they decided to be just friends and he tried to be a good example for her kids since they had poor father figures - I figured that's understandable).  At the time, he was constantly telling me I was the only girl he was seeing so I was weirded out a girl was calling him so late at night. 

While he was away I looked in their texts and noticed he saw her for Thanksgiving as friends to be supportive of her sons who were asking if he'd come (which he never told me because he said he didn't want to scare me off so early into dating). As I kept reading the texts, I guess this girl invited him to her Christmas party also and her boys and family were asking about him. He replied, ""Wow that's awesome they all want me to join! I'll let you know!""  I guess their wires got crossed - he meant he'd let her know whether could make it or not. But apparently, she took it as him confirming he'd go, but that he'd let her know the details, what time, etc. 

Her Christmas party rolls around and he last minute asked if he and I could spend it together (we were still kinda new at this pt, only 1 month into dating). I agreed. In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" 

At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. 

I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.

For the most part all of the above I can relate to and empathize with. I don't believe he and this girl had a thing. What I can't seem to shake is him texting her, ""I wanted to see you more than anything"" He claims that he meant it as ""Don't think I was ditching you and your boys and didn't want to see you, I wanted to see you more than anything"" way to soften the blow because he was, in fact, ditching her. 

But no matter what angle I try to look at this from I can't help but think that phrase is romantic in nature and you don't say that to ""just a platonic friend"". Even 4 months later I still can't help but feel that was unacceptable and that's only something you say to your partner. It regularly floats around my mind that he said this to her. When people say how emotional cheating is wrong, this must be the feeling they're referring to.

Anyway I was wondering if any of you had a take on this? I've been in therapy about this and I feel better for an hour, then I fall back into feeling betrayed. I feel as though I'd been cheated on and continuing this relationship means I am accepting a cheater. I realize how crazy this sounds, but I have to be honest with the feelings this is arising me. What I don't know is this stirring up some childhood wounds? Or is this my gut telling me this was micro cheating or emotional cheating? 


A couple things to keep in mind: 
1) I have a similar issue with almost every guy I date. Something happens related to an ex or another girl, and I fixate on it the rest of the relationship. I am in therapy for this (4 years) and it's gotten significantly better but I felt it important to bring up my history

2) Boyfriend is a SUPER nice guy and very vocal about it everywhere we go to randoms. Again, I distrusted him he was so nice at first. He looks for opportunities to help people - where he can do CPR for older people collapsing, etc.  Example:  He lives in WI, I live in IL yet he drives 2 hours to see me, no questions asked, and gets a hotel every weekend so we can see each other regularly. Another example: After he met my friends the first time he wrote them ""I am so grateful I met this amazing woman and now have all these amazing friends. I just really love you guys!"" (My friends thought this was weirdly forward lol) Another example: he was married to a girl who had Lyme disease. They were not intimate once during the decade long marriage, he was strictly caretaker and said that's what you do for someone you love. She eventually cheated on him (he still remained faithful) and the distrust ended the marriage. 

3) He doesn't hide anything from me. He has our picture as his FB default, he regularly posts announcing how happy I make him (to the point this girl deleted him), he never hides his phone - he'll leave it in plain sight when he goes to take a shower and tells me if I want to go through it I may. (Aside from the above when I scoured it and found nothing else, I don't because I don't want to misinterpret things). 

4) No idea if this is relevant but he told me he was exclusive with me since our first date (Nov 17), But we didn't make it official til Dec 23.

5) My therapist heard both our sides of the story, she said she sees nothing wrong with it, that he said that to her without knowing the girl's hidden motives (she was probably keeping him on the backburner based on her emotional reaction to all this) She also said it made sense he did it to to alleviate the guilt he felt with letting down her sons and he did so with the intent of me never seeing it (not gona lie that made me feel worse). She tells me I need to stop intellectualizing to escape deeper hurt and instead focus on the earliest childhood memory of this. I try and usually fail, I feel better for an hour, then revert back to the feelings of betrayal.

6) When boyfriend and I discussed it right when it happened, he claims he never wanted to be with her, he was just being nice combined with that being ""just how he talks"" (to be frank he does throw the phrase ""more than anything"" around a lot in his daily speech).

TLDR My boyfriend bailed on a female friend's (who he went on 1 date with before meeting me but remained friends) Christmas party and blew her off to instead hang out with me. She reached out and asked why he didn't show, he fibbed he had to drive to the airport because he felt it was rude to flake/blow her and her kids off and texted her, ""I wanted to see you more than anything"" to 'soften the blow,  as if to say...don't think I didn't want to see you guys, I wanted to see you more than anything'
^ his words. 4 months later and I feel this was sort of micro/emotional cheating and still feel betrayed and can't distinguish if this is my gut warning me vs stirring up childhood wounds. Also can't distinguish if this was him being an overly nice guy or flirting.",05Apr2018,0

10,"Well, here goes. I'm 26. I have 2 awesome kids, 4 year old and 2 year old. My mom died 2 years ago, when I was pregnant with my second child. She died because of kidney and liver failure as a result of alcoholism and undiagnosed diabetes.
 I love my mom so much. She was an awesome mom. She stayed home when we were very young(middle child, one younger and one older) and then started working at a local grocery store deli. She kept that job through my high school years, and was let go for reasons unknown to me. After that she went from job to job, spending months in between jobs being depressed and drinking. 
My father is strong, and supported all of us the entire time. He is also doing very well. He had a heart attack a year ago and has improved himself in leaps and bounds. Lost about 70 lbs, avoided possible transplant. I'm so proud of him.
But, I was a momma's girl. She was the family's emotional support system. I was never afraid to tell her when something fucked up happened in my or one of my friend's lives. 
One fucked up thing- I told her that I cut myself when I was in high schoold and she never followed through. At the time I wasn't that upset about it, but now I'm pissed. If my child told me that shit... I'm honestly not sure but I don't think that I would act like it never happened.
Now here I am. 26, stay at home mom for four years. I feel very lucky that my husband is supportive of me raising our children. I think I'm doing a good job at motherhood. (Warning, shameless kid brag) My 4 year old impresses his teachers with his language and social skills, my 2 year old is fucking wild and I'm so excited to see when she puts all of that energy. 
But then, the kids go to bed. 
I stress drink. We're buying a house, out of our budget, but it's his grandparents lake house that he and his cousins spent so much of their childhood at. I am good with going in over our heads for that, but I know I'll be freaking out for a while. Car just broke down. I've been drinking too much. I've recently tapered off of lexapro for post partum anxiety. 
Also, I've recently been diagnosed with ADD(innatentive type). Adjusting to meds, trying to find what's right. I barely have time for any ' self care'. There are so many good things in my life but it's so fucking hard for me not to focus on everything that sucks.

15,"Dear people of reddit. My ex left me very abruptly last year, and had been struggling with mental health issues for a while. As I have slowly started to piece together what happened, and based on timelines, I think with great certainty that she only ""fell out of love"" with me because of her anxiety and medication. She had been taking anti-depressants for about 5 months and had felt like they hadn't been working (likely because she suffers from anxiety and not depression). She started her last year of school which involved an internship, and also started a new job, and she and I both lost a mutual friend in an accident, all within a month. 

At this point she went back to her doctor and said the anti-depressants weren't working. The doctor insisted she see a counselor so she picked the first one of the list to get it done. The doctor doubled her dosage of anti-depressants and added another medication. 

Within 2 weeks of that happening she just started to ice up. She wasn't wanting to have sex anymore, she wasn't wanting to go do things, she wasn't wanting to even talk much or hang out with me. There were a couple days here and there where things were better, almost back to ""normal"" but it was basically not there for her. 

Every time I tried to talk about it she wouldn't open up. Then one day she started packing up to move out (back in to her parents house). She kinda sort of hinted at needed space/emotional support, but also kinda sort of hinted at taking a break. I asked her to talk to me about it and she simply wouldn't, or couldn't. She moved out, and I let my own anxiety run wild with thoughts of cheating or other things, but then thought about what had happened the last couple months of our relationship. 

I strongly believed that she had been dealing with anxiety, and didn't know, so she got on anti-depressants (wellbutrin) and I strongly believe the wellbutrin made her anxiety worse. The other medication she was given I believe was lexapro. Many anti-depressants/anxiety meds can cause people to lose their libido, and can often cause issues to worsen instead of get better. 

I believe that she thought her meds were the solution to her problems, rather than just something to control the symptoms. She chronicly worries about the future, all the ways it can go bad, what people think about her, judge her for, and drives herself down endless mental rabbit holes of worry, stress, and fear. 

So when the wellbutrin wasn't working her anxiety clawed her brain for a reason, was it this part of her life? this other part? etc. She was still dealing with anxiety, and the wellbutrin made it way worse, and she apparently lacked even the vocabulary to start identifying her feelings. 

After a month of talking to her post breakup I convinced her she needed to talk to her doctor and counselor about it. She needed to open up, and be proactive because that was the only thing that would ever help. I assume she talked to her doctor and counselor about as openly as she talked to me about these negative feelings and emotions (she didn't). 

She seems to make the emotionally safe decision whenever she comes across something that causes her distress, and once she buries something and pushes it away she refuses to look at it again, or try to mend it. She has apparently done that her whole life. 

Am I crazy to think that the only thing that dug between us was her anxiety? We had been solid for years, and the only change had been the meds, and the timing of stress sources in her life. 

Years ago I saw a counselor and was diagnosed with depression and some anxiety. I approached it very proactively, and quickly developed the tools to identify sources of my issues and process them so that they were gone or manageable. 

Since she would never talk about anything, I didn't feel like I should really bulldoze my experiences into her life, I felt that I needed to just be there and supportive, as that was what I would have needed when I dealt with my own mental health issues. 

I asked her if she thought it were possible given the timing of everything, and how long we were happy together, that the only thing that came between us was her anxiety. She said ""I don't know"" and I asked ""have you thought about it?"" she said no. I then asked if she thought that given the circumstances, she could work through that question and see if we could reconnect. She said she felt like it would never work (again anxiety) and that we should just have a nice ""clean break"" AKA her pushing out those negative emotions and pretending they are gone.


Should I give up on the woman I wanted to marry? Should I try and continue to help? What does she need to do to work through what she is going through? I want to see her become whole again, whether or not I get to be a part of that whole. ",05Apr2018,1
17,"Long story short, I was neglected as a child. My mother dated many guys during my childhood,  and they were all abusive in one way or another. The most recent ex was one she dated the whole time I was in high school, and he showed zero care or any positive feelings for us. He locked us out of the house and screamed at us all the time; stuff like that. 
My mom had her own issues, and was emotionally unavailable. She was even suicidal during my Jr. high years. I also have 8 siblings, so there was never much to go around. 
I dated an abusive guy too, cliche as that is. He was a typical douche, dated me when I was 18 and he was 29 and took advantage of how little I knew about the world. He was very judgemental and cynical, and brainwashed me into thinking that nobody else would ever want to date me and that him yelling at me for hours was normal,  yadadada. 
Anyway,  I'll get to the point. 
I'm in college, and it feels like everyone is so angelic, yet so human. I always expect to be screamed at or put down or whatever, but most people are nice. 
An example is that my mentor helped me build a resume,  and today I messaged him and said I'd finished it and wanted him to look it over before I turned it in. I expected to be snapped at or something, and even prepared a response ahead of time. Instead,  he was happy that I'd finished it and was enthusiastic. I was stunned and cried for a little bit. Everyone was nice for the rest of the day too. I went to an event later, and when I was leaving,  my friend told me to message her when I got back home so she could know I made it back safely. I cried about that too,  in private,  of course.
I guess I have pretty low expectations when it comes to people. I'm scared to get close to people though, because I feel like it'll just make it that much worse when they eventually show their dark side.

18,"When assessing what's 'wrong' with us, we often dig deep and often into the past to try and explain why we are the way we are. As a result of this, I am having trouble with this mindfuck.

I am struggling with how to tell apart genuine experiences that have had a negative effect on my mental health and potentially just digging up things from the past to justify some form of 'victim state' which I may or may not have.

The question comes from a place of interacting with other people (who cannot relate to your experiences) and them saying things along the lines of 'how could something that has happened this long ago still affect you so much, surely you got over it by now', and just generic asinine advice, like in response to why you are socially isolated or depressed 'just be yourself, just put yourself out there' etc.

I was wondering if anybody ever thought about this, and is able to share their thoughts on the subject? I am less concerned with what other people think, but in flushing out the 'true state' of my being in regards to that balance of how much is explained by the actual negative events from my past, and how much it is me trying to pick and choose things to justify the 'victim' status.

My dad is a Vietnam war veteran and suffers from PTSD and bipolar disorder. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year or so after he returned home from the war but his symptoms of PTSD (hoarding, night terrors, random outbursts of anger, constantly being on guard, etc.) didn’t really appear until the 90s. He was constantly in denial about his mental illness and would explode in anger if someone expressed their concern or ask him if he’d be willing to see a doctor or therapist. 

After a suicide attempt in 2013 I too was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Since then, he has slowly become more open about discussing his problems. 

This time last year he started seeing a psychiatrist at he VA. After his first appointment he came home and told us that the psychiatrist seemed really concerned and tried to have him to stay for inpatient therapy but somehow he convinced the psychiatrist not to. So instead, the psychiatrist evaluated him and prescribed him a few medications for PTSD. My dad hasn’t been consistent at all with his medication so he hasn’t improved at all.

The past few months my mom and I have noticed that he’s extremely paranoid and doing even more weird stuff (e.g.  keeping empty bottles that would normally be thrown out and putting other food liquids/syrups/oils in them even though they were already bottled , buying and getting free things from donation centers which then adds to his hoarding, and saying paranoid things like how we’ll be kicked out of the country because we have Mexican heritage and that he wants my brother and I to legally change our last name because we’ll be discriminated against since our last name is obviously Mexican). Most recently he randomly emailed his sister in law (that he hasn’t spoken to in many years) a very long rant about politics and religion and it really freaked her out. 

What can/should I do to help him?? 
Should I ask him to mention what he’s doing that’s concerning us to his psychiatrist?
Should I contact his VA psychiatrist directly?
Should I sit down with him and talk about the paranoia my mom and I are concerned about?

Knowing my dad he’ll be offended and angry if I do any of those things but I refuse to just not do anything.

I feel like my whole identity is in the hands of society and they can take everything from me with their opinions. They can just brainwash me. I am literally afraid of being a fan because I constantly feel attacked and everything I see about this band spikes my anxiety because I am somehow always prepared to read something negative about them. It hurts. ",05Apr2018,3

My 21 year old brother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about a year ago after a failed suicide attempt. 

My parents never believed in mental illness so this was a huge shock to them and clearly they're not equipped to deal with this because for an entire year they've just kept him locked up in his room not letting him see anyone or do anything really, just doped up on meds. Watching this just disgusts me but I don't even know where to begin helping, especially since he himself is sort of in denial about having anything wrong with him. Any suggestions? 

I don't even know who to contact about this or where to begin searching for someone to contact. 

I've already told my parents that only meds isn't enough and that some form of therapy or human interaction is necessary but they won't listen. They tell at me when I try to interfere or voice my opinions so  I'm not sure how to make them realize they need to get better help for him. He used to have some sort of social worker come talk to him once a week for fifteen minutes but that doesn't seem to be happening anymore. 

Any suggestions on who to go to got assistance or what to do would be greatly appreciated.

32,"Over the past year and after some traumatic incidents that happened I noticed I have been getting disturbed by making eye contact with certain people. 

I used to be friendly and outgoing and I still am to some extent. I've always attracted weird energy from people. When I'm not friendly I fake it in situations I have to be in and people usually can't tell the difference. 

The disturbed feeling does not happen with everyone and it has only happened a few times with strangers but when it does it is extremely intense. It feels like something is going to jump out of the other person's body and attack me through their eyes. My chest gets heavy and feels sunken in. 

It happened twice this past month. I went to go look at a rental house and it happened with lady who met with me. It also happened at a job I was working with another person who was a customer. 

I'm not sure if it's because of bipolar or BPD, or if it's me picking up on perceived threats. When I don't have to be around people I am not and spend a lot of time alone. I'm thinking it's made me much more sensitive when I interact. Has this happened to anyone else? I feel like the same ""spirit"" or something is following me in the body of different people.

34,"Hey guys, first time poster here and on mobile so sorry for formatting! 

I have struggled with mental health my whole adolescent and newly adult life.  I currently have been working in administration for the past 10 months.  I have been struggling a lot with myself and working. When I am at work I can never focus properly. I need to be listening to audio books, podcasts or actively doing something else or I feel like I am holding my breath. In my most recent 'Assignment' I was put in a 'quiet zone'. When I sat at my desk it felt like time was put to a stop, I talked to the people around me as little as possible but it was like a tick or impulse that I couldn't control. I was constantly getting dirty looks for tapping on my desk, being distracted by things going on around me or talking. I got the work done as best as I could, but I had so many intrusive thoughts and my mind would constantly wander to something else without me even realising it. I went through about one and a half litres of sugar free energy drink a day just because it was the only thing that would somewhat calm me down and chill me out. 

At home it seems like nothing can truly catch my gaze for a very long period of times, my mind wanders off or something else happens around me and I'm gone. Living like this is a total nightmare and I can have mood swings of angry, sad, happy in the blink of an eye. I seem to always be able to rationalise my oversharing or getting distracted and removing myself from tasks but I know that I shouldn't it's like I can't stop. It makes me so depressed. I hate how I am it's like a puppeteer is pulling my strings. I know that this isn't how I am on the inside and it breaks my heart. I don't know what to do. 

When I had my panic attack at work I was called aside by my manager. He said that I appeared unproductive and was a distraction for those around me and got rid of me on the spot (I am a tempt they can do with me as they please). I know I'm capable of doing well but I couldn't control myself. Please someone tell me what I can do to break free of this nightmare. I've been told I have depression and have been on medications for it, none seem right and it just makes me feel trapped inside my own head.

36,"I’ve been struggling a lot lately, but best to explain with a bit of background first, sorry this is long but doesn’t make any sense without context.

I’m a 24 year old guy, My dad passed away a few years back when I was 19 - he was an inventor, and this was at the back end of a three year court case alleging he stole someones idea. We’re a very normal family, and were being sued millions, so risked losing the house... my parents marriage was going down the pan, he was drinking loads etc. 

Anyway, it all get’s resolved, he gets a new job and on the day before he was due to start he has a massive heart attack - i had to give CPR, unfortunately he didn’t make it. Three months later I start university, i don’t know anyone and it feels like i’m a million miles away.

After it happened I went into autopilot, I was pretty much emotionless. I turned to drink and drugs in a big way, I just didn’t want to think about anything and it was about the only thing that could stir any emotional response from me at all. At the time I normalised it as just being what people do at uni, but before long I was going on these ridiculous benders and waking up in a police cell after clashing with people on nights out. I ended up with a criminal record for fighting, and my dreams of being a teacher were promptly over.

After this I had a total break down, I wouldnt leave my room, I wouldn’t go on campus, i woke up at 5pm and went to sleep at 7-8am the next morning every day. I ultimately decided I didn’t want to put my mum through anymore drama, and that Uni wasn’t working out. I quit drugs completely and dropped out of my degree.

I’ve been at home for nearly three years and my life is going so much better, i’ve not touched drugs since, i have a great job earning fantastic money, I met an amazing girl and we’re saving to buy a place together. The problem is that the feeling of numbness and of disconnection won’t go. I thought that over time if I fixed the things that were wrong with my life I might get better. But that hasn’t happened at all. 

I feel like some sort of high functioning zombie. On the surface it looks like I have sorted myself out and got my life together, i seem happy and free from anxiety and depression. But that’s as far as it goes. I’m never happy, or sad, or nervous or excited or anything. Everything bores me, nothing surprises me. I feel like the worst things could happen to my life, someone could bulldoze my house or a loved one could be killed and I just wouldn’t feel any different to what I do now.

I honestly don’t know what to do with myself. I set myself goals in things like my career and often achieve them, but it just feels like I’m going through the motions. I was such a happy thoughtful guy before all this, and I just want that back, but my brain just feels like it’s gone sterile.

Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences they can share? How do you fix this? ",05Apr2018,1
37,"Hi Reddit. I’m a 22 year old Asian-American. I started therapy about 2 months ago, and I know it takes time to see results, but I’m growing impatient. My psychologist is through university and practices more passive therapy (she doesn’t talk much). She told me I’m dealing with grief from my terrible breakup 10 months ago which I’ve accepted. But there’s something else, something bigger going on with me that is ruining my life. I’ll try my best to explain: 

-I’m “extroverted introvert.” I have a lot of good friends, I’m likeable, a decent internet following because I like to be funny and overshare. But sometimes I’m painstakingly awkward. When I meet new people I stumble over my words. My body language is visibly uncomfortable. Sometimes I avoid eye contact. I don’t really know what to say to them. Could be a social setting thing (as in I’m more comfortable in relaxed settings than professional ones.) 

-I like to stay busy. I work hard. I’m in my senior year of university and I work part time in a restaurant (one of the more reliable hostesses.) I leave my house at 9am and don’t come back until 12am because I’m running around doing stuff. Until I don’t. I could stay in bed and not do anything for multiple days. Recently I haven’t been working as much as I usually do and just finding covers instead. I don’t attend classes when I want to. I just stay in bed. The days bleed into one another. I am losing track of time. I have no idea when was the last time I showered. Showering feels tedious. I used to like showering a lot but now I just can’t wait to get out and go lie down. I ran out of clean underwear. I keep telling myself to do laundry and I don’t. These are tasks I never have trouble doing. 

-I’m never home. I always like to be on the move. But 3 months ago something happened to me that really scared me. It might seems minor but it it’s very unlike me. I got up and got dressed. I planned out my day. And I just couldn’t leave the house. I looked at myself in the mirror and started tearing up. I didn’t know what was wrong but I just couldn’t leave the house. It was very unlike me. When I put effort into dressing up and doing my makeup, I leave the house. 

-I have irregular sleep patterns. I could either sleep all day or stay up all night. I average about 5 hours. 

-I’m not dumb. But I have to read things over and over again to understand. Sometimes I switch the subject/object in a sentence (“the house is at the dog”). I’m falling behind on class assignments. There are so many submissions I missed. I would start my papers in advance, but never get around to finishing them. It’s gotten so bad. My essay was due 3 weeks ago. I started 2 weeks in advance. I have most of it. I just can’t seem to finish. I sit myself down and attempt to finish but I freeze up. I start typing and then get instantly distracted. Whatever is wrong with me it is ruining my life and my gpa. This has been going on and off throughout college. 

-I used to be an A student in high school. I started developing insomnia in 11th grade and got my first D. Ever since then it’s been a rocky road for me when it comes to academia. I’m on academic warning at university. I don’t think I’m dumb...most people think I’m smart (could be the way I carry myself, the things I talk about.) But maybe I am? 

-In college I was in an extremely abusive relationship and had to deal with the trauma for 2 years following it. That was the initial reason for the gpa drop. Ever since then I got into a new relationship (just broke up 10 months ago) and I’ve been trying to pick myself back up and I literally can’t. 

-All that being said, I have managed to land 4 different internships. All highly competitive &amp; rigorous. I did fine through all of them. I have been asked to be involved in numerous panels and teach ins among the social movements within my city. I do think, not even trying to sound narcissistic, that people look up to me (because they tell me).

Please help me understand myself. I know I am capable. People know I am capable. I am reliable. Until I throw everything away. I am not lazy. I have good work ethics. But I don’t know if I’m just making up lies and excuses or there is something really happening to me. ",05Apr2018,2

39,"Hey

This is my first time posting here so not sure what to write but at this moment in time I’ll try anything. 

So basically a year ago my best friend underwent jaw surgery, not cosmetic but for pain relief. After the surgery she developed post traumatic stress due to her face being so swollen and she thought she was dying. Her face does look different but she’s still beautiful as ever. 

The doctors gave her some meds which numbed her pain I guess and we didn’t speak for a year as her family took her phone away from her. She was self diagnosing herself from google. Her dad suddenly died last November in his home country, she had to snap out of what she was going through and travel with her family so they could arrange his funeral. It seemed as though her own problems had disappeared. 

We met in February this year and she seemed like her normal self except for the fact that she’d gained a substantial amount of weight due to the anti depressants she’d been taking and for some reason guys were quick to comment on her weight making her feel way worse than she already did. I was so happy to see her getting control of her life again. 

We booked a holiday to Dubai to celebrate my birthday and her getting better. A week ago she messaged me saying she’s opened a new business and how all her dreams have come true. She’s put an offer in on a 7mil house and wanted me to choose my house too. I found this strange but I went along with her. I drove to her house 2 days ago to collect her for our holiday, she kept saying she was working and will be out soon so we can go. I sat there for 3 hours whilst she did nothing, no packing or anything. Just posting weird snaps about people funding her for her business etc. Her sister called me to say she was going Dubai and she was adamant no one would stop her. So we decided the break would do her some good. 

I feel like that was our biggest mistake. I picked her up and all she did was talk irrationally about this business idea that Mark Zuckerberg was involved in and how they were going to change Instagram. She’d also met someone who had the same views and somehow connected all these dots that led to her marrying him. She wanted me to quit my job and work for her yet I still didn’t get the purpose of her business which she now calls a charity for her dad and that she was guided by god. The airport journey was stressful, she told strangers about her business and was trying to recruit staff. I had to beg her to enjoy the holiday and we’d talk business after. She spent a ridiculous amount in duty free like £150 on notebooks to write down her plans, plus 2 phones, one for celebs and the other for special people. I managed to take her card away from her. 

She hasn’t slept in two days, we got to the hotel at 1am. I fell asleep and she woke me up at 9 to tell me about an epiphany she’d had. It was the same story she had told me 10 times already. I felt like crying, I don’t know where my best friend is. I don’t know what to do to make it okay, I can’t get through to her at all. I’ve been in touch with her sister and we’ve decided that I’d go along with her, if I don’t she becomes irrational. We went to Dubai mall and she wanted me to reassure her plans, so we walked around whilst I lied about how her business was amazing and how god knows this and wants her to enjoy and then plan when we get home. She’s finally asleep in bed and I’ve been through her phones, she’s messaged hundreds of people about her business, all of her friends too. She told me they were all on board but by the looks of the messages they’re laughing at her. Even this guy who’s marrying her, he hasn’t replied to any of her messages but she is so adamant that he’s said these things. He hasn’t. 

She’s finally asleep but I don’t know for how long, she may wake up and decide to “work” on the business. She’s spent all her money and her family have sent her £200 for food, it’s a struggle to get her to eat. I’m not that well off and only have enough for myself. I’m so angry right now, I’ve spent so much to be at this dream destination and all I’m doing is sitting in this hotel baby sitting her. I know it’s not her fault but I just don’t know what to do. Her family have contacted the doctors and when we get back I’m taking her to her sisters house. She think she’s moving into her office at this luxury hotel in London. 

I know this is long and some of it isn’t written properly but I need to get some advice before she gets up. I can’t take it anymore. I shouted at her today and I’ve never than that before. 

Thanks in advance x

I should add that she was the strongest person I ever knew, we met at uni and nothing phased her. she had major attitude but was so lovely. Everyone liked her, she had so many mates and was great to be around. She met someone and dated him for 3 years, he was the love of her life. When she moved back with her family after uni he changed. One day he just stopped talking to her and then she found out he’d gotten married. She’s never truly been the same since as she couldn’t let go, I feel this was the start to her downfall.

40,"I've known this person for two years and I have a hard time understanding the way they think, or more specifically why they act or operate the way they do. We’ll call this person X. 

I have observed that X has trouble empathizing with others and has even admitted so. They do possess feelings; they just have a hard time understanding others’ feelings. X can express their emotions, but only to a limited degree. X has stated that they have trouble relating with others, and rarely does so. 

However, X still has many friends and is very outgoing and cheerful. They're not antisocial in any sense.

 X often expresses the fact that they do love their family members, friends, etc, but as aforementioned, has trouble relating to them. 

I’m not a doctor; I’m not trying to diagnose X. I just want to better understand this person.

41,"I really love and care about my significant other, and other people and things in my life, but at the same, I can imagine a tomorrow where they wouldn't be a part of my life, while not feeling sad thinking about it. I haven't told anyone about this, because I'm not even sure if it's how I truly feel, and I recently figured it may have something to do with the fact I lost my dad at 13 (I'm now 26).  
It's like life taught me not to care about things, because whoever or whatever you like may not be there tomorrow, and my way of cooping with that is by rationalizing that I better not care about anything at all?  
This is also the time I started escaping from reality by playing video games (I find the virtual world more comfortable, and easier to understand), which is what I continue to do today. I can't seem to make myself care about much going on in the world, as I see humans that don't seem to care much about or realize the consequences of their actions. Combined with my inability to change this, it's hard to feel motivated about anything, so I better just disconnect. But at the same time, I'm still interested to know what's going on, out of self-interest and out of curiosity. So I care, but I don't really.

44,"I feel like I am throwing my life away and there is nothing I can do to stop from going down the depressing path I find myself on now.

I want to be like my favorite artists and just run away following my passions but the success/failure rate is terrifying plus I'm starting at basically zero and have no friends to do it with or anyone who will support me. I have no creative achievements and in the past I haven't been the type to be driven above all else to create so I'm not sure if I'm even a creative person. I'm sure as hell not talented, but I really fucking hate I.T. and the thought of working for anyone ever again is sickening. Jobs in general make me feel like I'm not worth more than my measly paycheck. I work 40 hours and go to night school for I.T. and the few hours I have in-between aren't even spent on hobbies, I just sleep cause I'm constantly exhausted but I need to work to pay bills and I need to graduate. 
I'm 21 so I am still young but at the same time I feel like it's too late to get started on the creative pursuits that I think inspire me.
It probably sounds like I'm whining and people tell me that I should just do it if i really want to but while everything in me wants to be this perfect version of myself, everything else about me suggests that i would fail and be worse off then I am now which despite being miserable is considerably stable.
I just want to be free but this world seems to want anything but that for me. What should I do? where should i start? Should i drop out and quite my job, move to the city with no money and figure it out or is that crazy in today's economy? Is the creative market too saturated for a complete noob to make it?

47,"For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated with the thought of women dying, or being killed. In fact, I can distinctly recall having these thoughts dating back to elementary school. Of course, back then there was no sexual arousal present in myself (at least that I could identify). This aspect of myself has followed me to this day. Before I matured, I didn't think much of it. But when I hit puberty, I began to feel ashamed. In fact, one might say I was in a bit of denial. I fantasized about it, sure. But I never admitted to myself what I was. In fact, I find it hard to admit it to myself now. Beginning to write this was hard for me, and still is as I continue to do so. I'm not crazy. I'm not a psychopath. I have no other apparent psychological disorders or dysfunctions. I'm just a normal and decent guy with, for whatever reason, an adnormal sexual interest. I would never actually harm anyone, I would never act out these fantasies in real life, and I respect women. I was planning on taking this aspect of my sexuality with me to the grave, until I met my current girlfriend.

She and I have been together for four years now. It has been great, and I love her with  all of my heart. About a year and a half ago, after finding some porn pertaining to my darker interests in my browser history (rookie mistake), I was forced to come clean. It took every ounce of courage I had to be completely honest with her, because I first had to be completely honest with myself for the first time ever. I had to apply labels to myself that made me feel subhuman. I told her exactly what my deepest and darkest sexual fantasies were. At that time, I felt exposed, I feared that she would break up with me, and I feared that other people would find out. 

But to my surprise, she accepted it. She told me that she understood that it what I was ""in to"" was beyond my control, and it seemed as if it didn't bother her in the slightest. She even told me she would, and she does, endulge me in my fantasies in bed (plays dead). She even says that she enjoys it, and jokes that it makes her job easy. Might I add, she isn't crazy either, haha. 

It has felt great to have a partner that is willing to do that for me. It feels as though a huge weight has been lifted from me, and I can finally fully sexually express myself. However, I still feel, on a moral level, ashamed. What would help me is some advice. Is it healthy for my girlfriend to endulge me in this way? What are your thoughts? ",05Apr2018,12

49,"I'm finding myself frequently fantasizing about brutally torchering people to death. I have very specific means of torture. Ripping off their noses with channel locks.

Then I would do the same thing to their loved ones just so they can also experience the psychological torment of seeing their loved ones tortured to death. After that I would them stare in the eyes and kill them. The blood, the screams, the pleading geninuinely brings my heart happiness. I had the living shit beaten out of me as a kid.

If I were to tell them has anyone got any advice on how to go about it? ",05Apr2018,1
54,"Hi Drew. 

I am writing this email to request time off. 
I understand this may not be well received the with things being busy however I would like to give my chance to explain myself. 
There is currently a lot going on at home and with my own mental health.  
Currently we are having issues with our landlord and the property which are not being resolved leaving us in an unsecure lease.  
My children’s health is  poor. And both myself and my partner are feeling burnt out. 
I am not proud to admit that my own mental health is getting worse and I am struggling to keep my focus on work. I feel that I may not be able to keep up the standards we require as a business.
Tomorrow i will be going to my GP and will need to speak to the housing, I have already taken the appropriate avenues for help last week in regards to my own mental health. But I currently must focus on my family and myself. 
I know that given a few weeks I will have a better grip on things and will be fit to return. 
I understand and apologise for the timing, given the jobs lined up is far from ideal for you.  
The company deserves my full attention when I am working unfortunately due to stress and depression I am struggling to keep that so.
I expect more from myself, the company deserves more from me, my family needs me.

Recently I decided to create a community for gamers like me to join and have fun together without being judged or bullied because it's something I would have loved to have when I was younger.

56,"I suffer from depression (currently taking antidepressants and start therapy next week) but I constantly feel like I need to be around people to be happy. Like when I’m alone, I get down and my negative thoughts consume me. How can I find my own inner happiness?

57,"I've only been depressed for about a month, but it's come on incredibly strongly.
 
I get very strong (though passing) urges to kill myself, typically slashing my wrists with a sharp object. I have already given 2 pencil sharpeners to my girlfriend, though there is another lying around in my room somewhere.

I spent a good 15 minutes earlier today nearly transfixed looking for it, determined to do something horrible to myself. I don't know if I would have gone through with it, as I didn't find it, but it is a scary thought.

I will be telling my therapist about it tomorrow, but I am a little apprehensive about being potentially hospitalised.",05Apr2018,4
59,"My Brother (24) is going down a dangerous path. He's got a police record. 2 DWI's, fleeing police, stealing gas. He just keeps doing dumb shit. Today he was arrested for fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle. It looks like he will be facing felony charges. We suspect he's got a mental health issue, but can't get him into a doctor because he's an adult. We also suspect he may be on the autism spectrum. They tried kicking him out. He lived in his car for about 4 months, but he didn't change his ways. He convinced my parents to let him move back in. My parents have bent over backwards for him, and it's like he doesn't even appreciate it. My Dad is to the point where he doesn't care what happens too him. He wants to wash is hands of everything. My Mother on the other-hand just wants help for him. But everything we do gets us nowhere. We are so lost. What do we do? I'm afraid for his future.",05Apr2018,1
60,"I'm finally reaching a point in my life where I have no idea what to do. I've been through college, worked a full time job, and am now back in college because I absolutely loathed what I was doing.

Originally I had a lot of drive to get things done. I *wanted* to get things done. Now after classes I go back to my apartment and either watch youtube endlessly until I'm exhausted or literally sit on a couch and do nothing. Nothing brings me satisfaction anymore. I just feel indifferent.

Anything that happens to me that any normal person would perceive as good just feels like a curse. I recently got an internship offer from a major company that nearly everyone in tech tries to get into, but I didn't get the exact placement I wanted so I just feel like giving up and not bothering anymore.

It just feels like any time something seems to work out for me, or I take one step forward to achieve my goal, I then take 2 steps back. It just feels like life is fucking with me just to see how long I can go before I break.

I just feel broken down to the point where it's not worth trying anymore. I'm in almost 100k of student loan debt (and my parents cosigned about half of it) that I have no way to get out of. I have ~$20,000 in credit card debt that I have no permanent job to pay it. I have a car that I owe ~$15,000 on and have insane bills for car, dental, and health insurance every month. Not to mention that the rent near my college is insanely overpriced. Like 1800 for a single bedroom in the middle of nowhere overpriced.

I just wish I could take something and look on the bright side for once. I could possibly have a full time job offer at the end of the summer. I have what everyone calls a great opportunity to work on the team I was assigned to. But all I can think is:

*""You're a fucking idiot. You quit a full time job to accomplish something but you can't. You never will. Just give up. Stop wasting more and more money.""*

I just wish I could finally catch a break and appreciate it. Instead I always just look at anything that should be good and analyze everything that I **feel** is wrong with it. Especially this internship. It's not the right team, it's not something I want to do, it's not this, it's not that.

I don't know. I don't want to do anything drastic. I just want to stop feeling like shit.",05Apr2018,4
61,"Hi everyone, Im going to list some things that I've been experiencing lately and would like some feedback as to what you think is going on.


I no longer feel as though I have 100% control over my emotions at times. Very small things have been pissing me off lately and I go from 0-100 there's no middle ground. I go from not being fine to extremely pissed off wanting to punch something. Very rarely do I punch something but the other day my dog wouldn't stop following me around the house after I had fed her and taken her for a walk and after being annoyed for a while the anger just bursted out of me and I was yelling at the tops of my lungs, punching a chair, and I threw my phone into the wall. As this was all happening I was sort of watching myself from a different perspective confused as to why I was so unstable but I didn't stop. That lasted for about 15 seconds and immediately after I was shocked at how angry I had gotten. And no, I didn't hit my dog and never felt the urge but after that I'm scared for my own safety aswell as hers. This is the first time that I've just lashed out like this. (After calming down I connected the dots and realized it was because she missed my sister who had been gone for a few days)

Ever scince a kid I've always expressed my thoughts out loud when I'm alone ( I don't say talk to myself because it makes me feel like I'm crazy) and recently I've realized that I can no longer stay on the same train of thought for very long. I'll be talkin about whatever and all of a sudden a new thought will pop up and I'll start talking about that not even realizing that I changed subjects for a few seconds. (I've been getting better at ignoring those thoughts but it still happens often) Sometimes when I'm talking aloud to myself I'll get so many thoughts at once that I can't doing anything but sit there in silence for a bit to recollect.

Say I read an inspirational quote. I'll go from self conscious to feeling like I'm on top of the world and ready to conquer anything back to how I felt before reading said quote or maybe forgetting I even read it within about 10-15mins.

I have moments where I realize that I'm a fuckup and i start to go over my problems and what I need to do to fix them and feel very inspired to do so only to end up doing maybe one small easy thing and then going back on my phone or computer.

Frequently in class, I'll be giving my full attention to what the teacher is saying and then next thing I know I've missed a bunch of notes because I just zoned out and was in my own world thinking about whatever for a minute or two. it's very frustrating as I really am trying to pay attention but it just happenes and I don't even realize it's happening.
 
The whole unstable emotions thing seems to have manifested  over spring break so I'm really scared about how school is going to go although I've been fine around my parents and siblings I honestly no longer am 100% sure of how much control I have.

Also, i remember as a kid (5th grade) would be getting excited for a sleepover at a friends only to out of nowhere develop a very temporally depressed mindset telling myself that a sleepover was just a sleepover and in an instant all the excitement was gone and I just felt empty... if thatstandpoint. The closest feeling I can match it with is when you're depressed and genuinely don't find joy in anything. Emptiness. That only lasted for about 5 mins though.

I know that a lot of us did this but as a kid maybe around 3rd-4th grade when my my mom was in the store for too long instead of just being scared/nervous or whatever  I would immediately assume that the store was being held hostage and that my mom was in danger untill I realized that people where still walking in and out and I would calm down. 

I tell myself that I won't actually do x or y but when I tell myself that I don't have that 100% sureness anymore. (Is sureness even a word lol)

Anyways, sorry if I'm all over the place but if you read through this thanks I really appreciate it aswell as your input.

How long do these feelings last??

62,"I am only 20 and have always had a bad time memorizing literally the most simple things. I've lived in my parents house for over 10 years and I sometimes can't remember which cabinet is for glasses or bowls and plates. I still sometimes can't remember for a second which dresser drawer has either pants or shirts and sometimes mix them up. I also get kinda lost in almost every building I go into and it takes me an emmense amount of concentration to remember where I'm supposed to go. In high school I would sometimes feel unsure of which classroom is mine, even when I'd been in that class for the whole school year.
Is anybody else like this? I seriously beat myself up trying to figure out what is wrong with me.",05Apr2018,2
64,"I will preface by saying my brother is 27yrs old and I am his younger brother 20yrs old. As long as I can remember he was always fighting with my parents, stealing money, and being a huge asshole when he didn't get his way. My parents thought he was fine until middle school when he got into a fight and was bullied a few times until he graduated high school. He is the tallest and largest person in our family and he has always abused his good genes by shoving my dad and beating the crap out of me when I was younger. It had gotten so bad that my dad had to file a restraining order against him and he is not allowed at our house. 

Now: I am a sophomore in college and I kept my distance from him since the freshman year but now my family and I are starting to see more odd behavior. He tries to be manipulative and get us to do things for him, he gets visibly upset when I talked to him in person, and he gets very moody when he doesn't like what we are talking about. I can't explain everything he does but something is off about him. We are almost certain that he has narcissistic disorder but just the other day for my mom's birthday he snuck into our house and flipped a bunch of pictures and objects as a ""prank"". My parents are getting scared and I am worried about what he'll do next. I want to help him and I want to fix whatever's wrong before its too late. Can anyone share ideas or thoughts on what is the right thing to do here? 
What might be wrong with him? What can we do to help him? Anything helps thanks.

P.S. He won't go in for mental health evaluation. Don't know why. He also won't acknowledge his past of being abusive, untrustworthy, and mean; He thinks my parents owe him more and he should be able to use their money whenever he'd like.",05Apr2018,2

66,"Well, I recovered from DPDR both last year. I dont have any symptoms. But since it has gone away, I've felt so damn depressed, feeling overly emotionally drained, suicidal at times, split identity, delusional thought patterns and in general this overhelming feeling in my body which takes so much energy.

It is so damn hard to live like this at times to be honest. I havent seen any therapist or psychiatrist tho, because I am very pessimistic. What if it doesnt work? I am ready to kill myself then because no one can lead a life in this mental state I am at the moment. 

Since I dealt with DPDR I feel very dumb, feeling like I cant function anymore, my cognitive functions are literally non existent. Last year ruined my life. Just 6 months of DP ruined my whole life. 
Everyday I ask myself: maybe I am not supposed to be here anymore, no one can bear that much suffering.

Fuck. Last year everything seemed to be fine somehow, I am 19, my life is over due to this shit.",05Apr2018,1
67,"i am 19 years old sophomore in college and have suffered from an undiagnosed mental illness for as long as since 5th grade where i remember an incident involving me trying to suffocate myself with my pillow, for the utterly ridiculous reason of my mom not letting me go outside to play with my friends. it was not until about senior year that i realized that maybe something was wrong with me mentally. i have never really talked about this subject with anyone except one counselor at my college a few months ago. i had a meeting in which they got my general story and told me they think i am depressed. 

they wanted me to start one on one therapy when i came back from christmas break, but i never started. one of my biggest fears, more so than just living with my mental issues, is being prescribed medicine that will fix my depression/whatever is wrong with me, but will change who i truly am. i have heard stories in passing of people that get put onto medication and turn to ""zombies"", ""weirdos"", or just described as ""not themselves"". I have no idea how true these stories are, its just word of mouth, but the thought just terrifies me. I for the most part love who i am when i am feeling mentally healthy (not counting my ""bad days"" where i do not like myself) and do not want to change. 

on my good days i am very energetic and playful and happy and very very individualistic. i would hate for any of this to change. however on my bad days i am very quiet, introverted, and do my best to hide away from people, responsibilities, work to do. these are the problems i want fixed.

does anyone have any advice for me? can anyone attest to my fears as nonsense? thank you for any help. sorry if this post is redundant at all.",05Apr2018,2

69,"I don't know what to do. I stayed home from school today because I wasn't feeling well. My mom didn't have work until 3, so at around 10 we were sitting at the table when her phone rings. My sister's in the hospital again, which isn't a surprise. She's 35 almost, and has had brain tumours and cancer since she was 9. She was in a wheelchair since age 16 and she was not expected to even live past 15. But today, on the phone, my mother started sobbing and said ""she's gone."" I screamed at the top of my lungs for my dad, and he came rushing downstairs. He fell to the ground so distraught, and my mom ran outside and started screaming. When she came back inside she fell to the floor crying and we all sat there sobbing. According to her carestaff she was normal when she woke up, took her medicine and was about to eat breakfast when she suddenly changed and couldn't move or speak, and she was shifting in and out of consciousness. They got her to the hospital and they tried to revive her, with no luck. It's really hard watching my mom be this upset. I wasn't very close to Alison, but I love my mom more than anything, and of course I cared about Ali. My mom is absolutely destroyed. It was so hard being at the hospital, I couldn't look at her body, I did not want to. I'm going to be missing school today and tomorrow, too, maybe some next week. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this isn't 'mental health' but I need help. I feel so alone and lost. ",05Apr2018,112
