2,"So here's the long story short: I'm an 18 year old girl, and I'm not totally anti-social, I guess, I don't have social anxiety or anything like that. I just am highly introverted with some extroverted qualities. I was bullied in 5th grade, and had a friend group in 6th/7th that I enjoyed hanging out with a lot. Then I moved in 8th grade to another state, and tried to find another group, no one would really ""let me in"" so to say, and I kinda gave up. At first I was kinda sad about it, and lonely, but after a year or two I kinda.... got used to it? At this point in my life, I'm a freshman college student, and I like to stay in my dorm, stay in every weekend with books or TV, and am really close with my mom. I have a best friend, but I don't talk to her as much as I used to, and I have a ton of distant friends and friendly acquaintances, but I don't really ever hang out or text with them, unless it's an occasion. This type of anti-social absolutely drives my parents mad, but I honestly just stopped giving a shit a long time ago, and I just got used to it. Everyone always asks me if I'm miserable, but living this way is my happy/comfy place, and I love it. Of course, if I go downstairs in my dorm to watch TV and someone else happens to be there, I make friendly talk, or if I want to sit out on the balcony by myself, and there are already girls out there smoking weed and chilling, I don't mind just sitting and talking to them. But after about an hour or two or socializing, I just get so...tired. I NEED to just be by myself and recharge. A friendly chat is nice once in a while, but if someone drags me to a party and I have to make small talk for hours, I just go home and crash. I always feel so drained after stuff like that. I don't know, does anyone else here feel the same? Cause I feel like a freak lol.",10Sep2018,1
3,"I have been to many psychologist over the years, but after 2 or 3 sessions, I always feel like they don't bring me anything good. 

People who found good psychologist and kept them over the years, how did you do it? What made you know it would work?

4,"I always really liked this person, I've consider them one of my best friends, one of the few people who I can trust and tell my problems.

I had some difficulty with this person before, they rejected me, I got really jealous when they started dating and took a while to figure things out, I still kinda am figuring it out. Still, I spent a lot of time with this friend and their significant other, I really like them both, but I fear this whole jealousy and possessiveness issue is starting to get the better of me.

Thing is, I know why I'm feeling this anxiety, I mentioned above, I had some difficulties, mostly my fault, with this person, but we both already talked about it with each other amicably.

I don't want to know the source, since I already know. What I want is a solution, a treatment, whatever can stop this feeling so I can feel good near this person again. I don't want distance from such an important friend.

I'm very strong and I don't mind confrontation, I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Seeking a therapist isn't really possible right now, unfortunately.

I'll share more information if you need more details. Thanks in advance for the help.",10Sep2018,1
5,"I don't know what to do. It wasn't until recently that I found out that most people don't have a cynical, angry internal narrative that tries to undermine absolutely everything in their life. I thought It was part of the struggle of life. Turns out, when I mentioned this, my wife just looked at me blankly.

I suspect everyone, friends, acquaintances, family of only tolerating my company, not enjoying it. When I'm complimented I ""know"" deep down I'm still a piece of shit. I procrastinate because anything I do never works out, and If I do start something, I quit it once I hit an obstacle, all the time the me in my head is telling me I should never have tried and i'm not ever going to be a success. I try to drown it our by doing things and making an effort, but I can't sustain it for very long before I convince myself I'm not worth it. I've been like this since I was a child and the only reason I haven't just killed myself is because I would fuck it up and... I'm just at the end of my rope here. How to I shut the voice up, my wife tells me she values me and then as soon as she's done saying that, I suspect her of lying. It makes me so angry, I can't  even articulate it. ",10Sep2018,1
6,"Hi everyone,

I am currently an 18 year old male in college as a freshman as a first time away from family. Lately, I was struggling with homesickness but it has devolved into something far worse: guilt about being gay. I think I am gay since I am attracted almost exclusively to guys (whether it's their body or face) more than girls. Without getting into too much detail, I feel that I get more ""excited"" when thinking about guys than girls. However, some compulsion made me feel like I would die on the spot if I didn't tell my parents about me being possibly gay. I have hid it for very long and would often have had episodes that would last for days if not a week when I'd feel guilty and undeserving of my parents' love if they knew that I could be gay.

So I couldn't take it anymore and just spilled my opinions that I might be gay and I knew it was a bad idea since my mom really dislikes the gay community. She would say that gay things are super disgusting and she even made us promise not to be gay everytime she figured out someone was gay whether it's in real life or on TV or something. My dad doesn't comment anything however so it was hard to tell if he would be ok or not. So I started off by asking what if I'm gay and if they would still love me because I think I am, they went into denial saying that modern American culture is making me think I'm gay even though that's definitely not how it works. My mom DID say that she couldn't just throw me away even if I was gay which was a giant relief but they didn't buy it basically. She did say that wouldn't you find it super disgusting to want to do it with another guy but in my mind, it's not that bad. My dad later said to not talk about being gay to my mom since she's really touchy and sensitive about it but he said I didn't have to try not to be gay since it wasn't anything I could control (he's a scientist!) but still said he doesn't think I'm gay.

I thought it'd be a happy ending there but it's crept back up about a week since and it has manifested into OCD. Now, I used to have OCD when I was younger around 11 where I could legit not get sleep being worried that I jumped too hard and somehow broke the underground fire system and would start a fire at night. And even worse, when national tragedies would happen, I'd SOMEHOW think that I was responsible for it. It's a total nutcase condition I know but I really thought that. Sadly, something to that degree has regressed for me and now I feel obligated to say any little gay thing I think or do to my parents or I'd feel guilty. Now, it definitely gets NSFW and it's disturbing to say to my parents even if I was straight but it's 10000000x worse since you know. I say it and they try to ignore it but I know they're getting tired of it. I try so hard not to but if I don't, I feel super guilty and wonder how I could ever look at their faces again and calling them makes me nervous everytime. I'd torture myself mentally for thinking anything remotely gay but I know it's really not my fault.

Today, I got slightly aroused thinking about a guy and decided to get rid of it through you know what. I try to find loopholes and say well I was thinking about a good-looking guy and then I'd think of a penis and then my own so that's why I get aroused. But I REALLY don't want to have to tell my parents this. But at the same time, I feel like I'm gonna explode with guilt if I don't. I know this is super weird and complicated but it's everything in my mind. Should I just wait it out to pass or find a therapist or something (the latter is going to be difficult, both to say the things and finding one)? I feel so overwhelmed right now...

I'd do anything to be straight so I wouldn't have to deal with any of this. What did I deserve to be like this?

EDIT: few more things I thought of:

I am super close to my family and this is why it's even more saddening for me. I wish they could see that I'm still the same first baby they loved and cherished and I'm still the bubbly, happy, good son I am. I'm actually meeting them this weekend and I'm not sure if I'll even be able to keep a smile for a millisecond. I wish I can just wake up and forget everything but as soon as my dream ends, I wake up feeling guilty and heavy... ",10Sep2018,3
7,"So I’ve got BPD, and my fp (favorite person) is currently very far away (in terms of actual location). I am very much attached to this person but it’s difficult for me to keep a conversation going. I recently started college so I’ve been busy and very tired almost all the time, I tell this person when I am busy or planning to take a nap, but I feel so damn guilty for not being available to talk as much as I was able to during to summer. This person means the absolute world to me but sometimes I just need a rest, and I let them know but on the inside I want to cry because I want to talk to this person as much as possible and I want to be sure that they know how much they mean to me, but I’m scared that the lack of conversation will make them think I don’t care or I don’t wanna talk.

8,"Hi everyone,

I am currently trying to lower/go off my psych medications and I am having a hard time of it.  I just feel like crap and I told my psychiatrist I will “deal with the consequences” of withdrawing.  I am feeling like I can’t cut it tho and have been taking my normal dose when I am feeling bad.  Anyone have any advice for coping with withdrawal?  

I’m trying to do this process slowly as per my doctor’s advice, but my symptoms seem to be coming back even with a slow taper.  I feel like I am so dependent on the help these drugs give me that I really can’t cope without them (my mood nose dives and my irritability goes through the roof) and I feel really weak.  I currently feel like my only option is other medications and I don’t want to do it.  I like the meds I’m on, but for various reasons I can’t continue them.  

Has anyone gone through this and felt better at the end?  Things seem really bleak at the moment, probably due to the withdrawal and because I can’t see a solution to my problem except being miserable.  Thanks in advance for any help.",10Sep2018,1

10,"All I do is make people worry about me. Why? I’m not worth their time of day. I’m just always that needy friend that needs someone to console them over nothing. I always turn everything about me, and I make minor problems a huge deal by overthinking everything and generally not having a filter. Everything would be a whole lot better if I wasn’t around. 

I don’t know why I’m holding on at this point. Guess I’m too anxious to find out what happens next, so here I am- leeching off of everyone- because I’m too scared to end it on the off chance that somebody actually cares. Why won’t people be honest and tell me what they really think? Nobody really cares about me, I’m pretty sure they just take me on as a pity case. My own parents probably wish they got dealt a different child than the waste of effort that I am. All I do is make everything difficult for others. I don’t deserve to get better, do I? I wish I had the balls to end it already, but I’m too afraid of potentially hurting someone who cares. Besides, plenty of other people have it worse than I do and they’re trying so hard. Useless bastard like me? A few trivial things have me on my knees. I’m not worth anything. I should just grow a pair and either make myself get better or end it. ",10Sep2018,1

14,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Not really sure where to turn so I thought I'd open up here and get some thoughts and perspectives on how i can deal with my situation. The short is early last year I found out my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I moved across the world to be back with her and spent 6 months just trying to make the most of the time/act as a caretaker for her. Treatment ended up working relatively well and she's doing better now which is great. I ended up starting a new job late last year and really I should be very appreciative as it's a very sought after role, pays well, great for my career, great culture and people but I basically have come to hate what I do and it has given me incredible anxiety and stress. I also don't want to quit because I remember how depressed I got when I was just looking after my mum and how I felt like my life was on stand still and I was just waiting for something to... happen.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition I've been trying to do long distance with my girlfriend back home and my dad's been diagnosed with Parkinson's and I feel so split and torn with no clear path for me to take. I guess I'm in a really shitty situation and I've been feeling really down and tired and I'm not really sure how life is really supposed to get better - it kind of feels like the next 10 years of my life will be tainted with sadness all the time and I'm struggling to sort of cope and process that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of maybe seeing a therapist or getting help in some way but I don't know where to start and I have difficulty opening up as well. Sorry if this is the wrong place.

16,"To start this story might be all over the place as I try pulling all the facts, but I need advice on what to do!

We have a Son who is 8 years old, who is a great kid, nothing really out of the ordinary from what most other kids do/say.  Recently he had an appendicitis, we took him to the ER and they were able to do a surgery that evening, removed the appendix, operation went great.... The morning after surgery his chest was so tight it was hard for him to breathe, so the nurses added morphine into his Iv, it calmed him down, but the he was in a great deal of pain, so we continued a morphine regime, since no parent likes to see their kid suffer... And this is where story starts.

(to help this part of the story I need to mention we had an outside cat get infested with fleas about a week before the hospital visit, we treated with pills, and have been treating place with that carpet powder flea killer, and that liquid spray that kills them as well.  Treatments have taken care of most fleas, but we had the occasional flea jump on any of us, so we continued the treatments while the surgery and recovery were still going on, and still are staying on top of things.)

While on morphine I noticed he was very itchy, never before seen anyone itch that much, but looking it up morphine has a way of making you itch, so no big deal.  He gets released from the hospital, and had the rest of the week off from school, nothing out of the ordinary happened until the following Monday he gets home from school.   He had a flea jump on him, and from then on he's been searching himself for a flea, not really finding anything, but continues to look.  everyday after school (I don't believe he's had any issue at school) he grabs a snack and sits on couch to watch some after school tv before homework, and just sits there checking himself, rubbing his head, behind his arms, ""dad can you check my back"", never anything.  It interferes with his food, and now he must drink with a lid on his cup to ensure nothing gets in it.  He has always been a ""snacker"" and not much of a full meal kid, unless its pizza then he can eat more than his older brother and sister.  This happens from Monday through Friday, these fits last until his moms home and does studying with him.  Saturday we take a drive to another city for the day/night and no real issues, on the way home on a 4 hour drive in the back seat of the car he starts it up again, mainly checking his hands, holding them infront of his face, and flipping them over to the back side, he will ball his hands to fists, and then open again, checking every so often, and he starts looking to the sides like he's looking over his shoulder, to his left, and to his right, back to his left, and over his right, his hands, front, back, fists, shoulders... over and over.  All day on the way home he just stuck to his tablet games, but after 2-3 hours in car is when it started... When we get to a restaurant before the last hour home, he didnt eat, just picked through his food like he was looking for bugs or fleas, or flies, or moths, or bees it seems ( I say those because that's the insects he says he's looking for when looking over his shoulders, he also says the hands thing is because he thinks he see's something on the front of his hands moving to the back of his hands around his fingers, when he flips his hands around nothings there.)

&amp;#x200B;

We leave restaurant, get home and settle everything in.  Mom makes his fav. mac and cheese.  I put it into a bowl with a lid, so he can open it, eat, and close it, to insure nothing can get in it.  ( I must say, our house doesnt have any bugs, besides the occasional fly, and spider... I explain it over and over to him that theres nothing like that in the house, that even if there was, none of these things can hurt him).  He starts checking over everything, his arms, shoulders, head, back, legs.. finally mom cant take it anymore and just feeds him... like you would a baby.  He eats just a little bit and says he's full. 

&amp;#x200B;

And here we are.  We are worried about how this issue is affecting his eating, and taking up so much of his attention, we are keeping him from school tomorrow to take to his doctor and draw blood to make sure he's fine there, his appointment with the surgeon is tuesday to make sure the recovery was full.  And at this point we are wanting to go to a psychiatrist, since it isnt that he's afraid of the bugs hurting him, its just the fact that there ""May"" be bugs, or that he is seeing them when there isnt any.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice and help! I've seen reddit solve the carbon dioxide poisoning situation, was really hoping someone on here has seen some of the issues we are having, and hoping someone can point us in the right direction!!

I am willing to learn and grow take on more responsibility, etc. but you can teach me with a nicer tone. I wasn’t rude to anyone. 

I hate when I see other teens/young twenty somethings Express their sadness about lack of financial independence, or other adulthood struggles, and replies are like:
“Welcome to adulthood. Can’t have mommy and daddy pay everything forever now can you. Time to grow up! Time to learn the real world. Can’t be pampered forever, etc. “

This is just what I thought of off the top of my head. But this is so rude sounding. Like just because young people express their discontent with something or disappointment doesn’t mean they are just spoiled brats and jerks. I’m tired of people treating the younger generations this way.

19,"Hi. 

Something along this line may already exist here, but I scrolled for a while and didn't see anything, so I figured it was worth a shot. 

I am the spouse of someone with severe depression. Before meeting my spouse, I had never been exposed to depression of this caliber before. We have been together for a little over 5 years. When we met in college, he was not on medication. After his depression spells would last sometimes weeks at a time with him feeling so low I could hardly recognize him, I convinced him to talk to a doctor and get on medication. 

He has been on medication for a couple years, but as we all know, mental health isn't exactly ""curable"". Every day is a work in progress. But even with the meditation, when big unavoidable responsibilities in life happens, my spouse plummets into deep depressions. 

I try to relate and understand what he is experiencing, but I know I never truly will. I don't always say the right thing, or do the right thing, but I really really try. 

Basically, I need help. I need suggestions. What can I do as a loved one to support him when he is in these low-lows? I know I can't ""fix"" them even though I badly want to. It is painful to watch someone you love suffer and feel so helpless on the side lines. What can I say or do to bring him any inkling of light in his darkest places? Any suggestions are helpful. 

Things I have tried so far:
-Giving him space
-Giving him NO space and being at his side
-Getting him out of the house 
-Doing things he normally would love to do 
-Offering to listen

20,"I’ve been told that certain things I do mirror Anxiety, other things I do mirror PTSD.  I was raised a Jehovah’s Witness and was trained in, I guess you could say, extreme loyalty.  There was a lot of sideways stuff that happened in my childhood, and some of it I’ve shoved so far back in my head and covered it with a monstrous amount of comedy and funny memories, that I don’t even know what happened.  The drawback is, you don’t live in the moment ever, you constantly space out, and you chew your fingernails down to almost nothing.

As a kid I would be spanked a lot, if it was my mom, it was with a wood paddle.  If it was my dad it was from his plethora of leather belts.  There were a ton of rules (entertainment, reading material, even your education is challenged as a JW) that I had to follow.  My mom remembers a day that something happened to me at school and I never told anyone what it was.  I just cried a lot.  Still not sure what happened.

As an adult, I joined the service.  Now, no longer a JW, I just accepted everything as a “worldly” person (“worldly” is basically a JW’s way of calling anyone who’s not a JW the n-word).  I’ve done and seen things that I just accepted as “this is my life now”, but never checked myself.  Case in point, my first time seeing a dead body outside of a casket was when I had to be a forensic photographer for a homicide.  Never got counseling over it.  Was just told to buck up and keep moving forward, because if I seek counseling, I’m out of the military.  Have done a few more like that.

26,"Hello,  this is just a post regarding my own mental health which has been a mystery to me for years, I apologize if it is tedious and long to read, I am just hoping for some thoughts from outside myself.

Since I was young I often find myself having these episodes where it is as if I am looking at everyday things for the first time, as if I am literally an alien waking up here and the weirdness of it often strikes me with an actual feeling of confusion. Generally it's fine, but often, and more increasingly as the years have gone on, it is accompanied by a sort of a fear and even a disgust with other people and more troubling my own self.

Sometimes I can have periods where I can't really recognize a face fully, as if the parts of the face don't add together to a recognizable whole, just a nose, then eyes, etc. (just to give you an example of the weirdness I'm talking about)

This sort of thing isn't intense all the time, but it always exists in a less noticeable way, that results in me being unable to recognize when my behavior is appropriate, and, when I was at least a little sexually active in the past, it resulted in me becoming repulsed by a person who becomes attracted to me. The more interested in me they become, the more repulsive and creature-like they appear to me. 

As the years have gone on I have become more and more suicidal, though I really wouldn't want to do that to my mother, as she tells me all the time how if anything happened to me it'd be the end of her, so I figure the least I can do is just try to outlive her.

But increasingly I have found myself experiencing this feeling, it's like an anxious feeling in my chest and gut, almost like the feeling where you are about to start crying, except recently it's become so intense it's almost like I've taken some kind of drug, I can't even think or sleep I just lie  there for hours sometimes. I've learned indirectly that Oxycodone actually really helped me with those feelings and for a period actually made me feel exactly as I had when I was about 14 or 15, I really felt like maybe I could be normal and happy (which honestly isn't necessary, but the heavy negativity is just too much)

But anyway, my source for Oxy went dry, and I ended up choosing to try heroin, which works ok, but it's more like a hammer to knock the feeling away, and during the times when I can't be on it due to nausea, the feeling is even more intense than it was.

I don't know what the feeling is, it doesn't connect to anything, is it loneliness? I don't know, depression? I don't know how anyone knows what concepts their feelings are connected to. If I could get Oxycodone back it might help but unfortunately it's near impossible to get now.

So basically I'm just wondering if any of this sounds familiar to anyone? I have never met anyone who seems to have a similar disposition to me, and so I just don't know what to do. I went to therapy several times over my life, sometimes forcibly, but usually the therapist seems confused or annoyed and suggests that I do things like go for walks in the forest or try to establish a routine. It's just not really enough and they are just way too expensive for tips like that honestly.

This is just sort of a short write-up of something that has many facets obviously but I just would like to know if anyone out there has similar problems and ways of coping with them.",10Sep2018,1
27,"20F.I've always been a person with melancholic personality.As a kid I never showed any sign of mental illness,I was an energetic,playful kid.Although I started showing signs of ocd, sometimes they would linger for a while,and then I would stop and develop another one.When J started entering puberty as normal with teens,my self esteem started declining,and I became more and more anxious with school,my future seemed uncertain and I just couldn't fit in.I started developing skin picking whenever I was was stressed or frustrated,and I developed both mental and physical scars,and it took many wasted years for anyone to take it seriously.I grew up in a family where people are nice and supporting,but they just didn't get it, this society or system whatever you'd like to call,is broken.It makes me think there still a looong way for our species to really evolve,and use our intelligence trying to solve problems,make life better,safer and happier instead of choosing to destroy our nature,make wars,being an aggressive archaic species.I'm not suggesting I'm any better,but I choose to do good,not judge,be a good friend but living in a world like this one,any dreamer or anyone who denies the status quo is getting themselves into a sad existence.I always questioned things the ""rules"",and since I started experimenting with psychedelics my ""third eye"" can't shut anymore and now I feel like I could only choose between comforting ignorance or or a sad realization that it is what it is.It's a huge post,not apologizing but ""anybody got time for that?"".And that's the problem I guess.
So I have a plan in mind for the rest of my 9-10 years more or less.I'll try to be the real me,do things I feel happy doing, spending time with my family and feel friends, exploring the world and caring for it and for the animals.If there's any meaning in life this is it for anyway, enjoy life.But after truly giving all I can I still don't find a purpose,I'll go to Switzerland and be euthanized,next to my family.I've talked to my mother about it.It's a sad thing to say, but If you want to die,you should be able to go painlessly and with no guilty.",10Sep2018,1

Hey, sorry for writing about this outta the blue but I am trying to ride off this thing as best as I can and until I can get to my doc I just wanted to know if someone else ever felt this. Google yields me nothing but I am shit at using the thing and questions are easier. Excuse my rambling. 

When I feel especially bad I keep getting mental images of my skin being removed (by me mostly)  and I get weird tingling sensations in those areas. Has anyone else had this? 

I have only been ever diagnosed with depression, however that was years ago and I haven't been re-diagnosed yet. It might be nothing but I am interested if there are others like me. Maybe I do not have anything but doc says that something is definitely not normal. 

I have a doctor, she is new,  we only had one appointment so far and I am bringing this up dw.

I dont want to be disrespectful to people with real mental heath isues and dont want to self diag myself but i would love to hear if other people are having the same problem as me or if its just in my mind.

I am a 26 old male and for the past 4-5 years i  keep having problems finding my words, like i would like to say ”here take this spoon” while handing you a spoon but I would say ”here take this fork”, i realise i have made a mistake and in the efort of correcting my self i will say „sorry, i wanted to say knife” and it would make me a moment to recall the word spoon. 

I have problems sometimes to say coherent sentence when i say a story because my mind would jump to other topics i would stutter and make gramatical error or sentences that do not make sence.

Another example is that i went to HR with some vacancy papers for a coworker, when she asked me what i had there first i said i had 2 days of vacancy insteand  of 2 papers for vacancy, then i said i had 2 certificates of vacancy, and for the life of me i could not remember 2 papers.

Another example is I was talking with my mother about sending her a email and asked her what was her email, and noticed that she did not changed her new email to her married name and told her she should probably change her email. After i sent her the email instead of saying „i sent you the email” i said „i made you a new email”. 

Some info that could help:

I sleep around 7-8 h a day, and sometimes i take naps in the afternoon, the is some stress to my job (social worker) but i dont view it as a stressful job and i dont worry myself about the emotional side of my work, or what people say about me.

35,"Hi, I'm just wondering if anyone had experience/advice about this... I have a relative who is mentally ill (undiagnosed but clearly some sort of illness that causes major paranoia). For a few years now, she's just been driving around the country, staying at hotels. Her ex husband is very rich and has supported her financially, which is what allows her to do this. She started getting paranoid about some stuff in a family estate and thought the executor (my uncle) was against her/us, she hired a lawyers, etc., well, everything was perfectly fine of course, and I guess since everyone came to that conclusion, she disconnected her phone number, doesn't answer (or likely even deleted) her email. She thinks that various groups of people hack into her phone and email and spy on her.  So now we don't know where she is. Her ex husband thinks she might be in CA, but I don't know why he thinks this... I also have some mental illnesses and get kind of paralyzed trying to help with this... so I don't have all the info.  My dad and grandma died soon after each other which started these estate issues and looped me into it...  Anyway, is it possible to find her, and how?

36,"Please don't laugh if this is impossible, but to be honest I'm really lost here and I don't know how else to explain my body's suddenly incredibly negative reaction to my previously ""harmless"" (yeah, I know excessive drinking is not harmless) habits.

&amp;#x200B;

3 years ago I went on a summer vacation with my uni classmates. It was sort of connected with a certain uni project, but the weather was great, we had a lot of free time and every day after work we'd have a party.

Some of us barely ever sobered, I am a petite female, but I could drink **a lot** and still feel pretty great. I would go to sleep at 3-5 am every night, didn't throw up once.

At the end of the trip I received a call from my parents informing me that something really bad happened back home. I don't want to get into details, but it involved a sudden and tragic death of close relatives. Needless to say that the remaining few days of those holidays are a blur, mostly doing minimum of the work and sleeping 18 hours a day.

It's been 3 years and I cannot drink alcohol and have fun ever since.

I really was no lightweight when it came to drinks, and yet ever since this happened one glass of wine or one can of beer can send me to the bathroom puking and then all I want to do is curl up somewhere and sleep. I also don't remember a party in which I was able to truly relax.

I thought I dealt with this tragedy fine, never felt the need to seek counseling. I was grieving for a few months and it was tough, but then life just moved on. The only thing that remained is this bizarre ""allergy"" to any type of alcohol.

Is it possible, that my reaction is purely psychosomatic? And can I do anything about it, since otherwise this trauma does not affect me anymore, so I don't think there would be much to talk about with a therapist?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a problem focusing on work. Sometimes I'll stare off into space, other times I'll start reading a story and become so engrossed in it that I don't realize things happening in the world around me. I want to fix this, but at the same time, I don't because I'm pretty sure I'll end up dead by 30 anyway. So why bother? Sometimes, things will annoy me a lot, like when other people are attempting to push my buttons, I get the strong urge to punch them or lash out. (Is that normal??) Sometimes I just wanna sleep for 12 hours. Sometimes I have these thoughts- call of the void, I'm pretty sure- basically imagining different ways I'd die. (I don't think I'd do it?)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really have close friends, and the friends I do have are just people I talk to because they initiate conversation. I'm paranoid they're talking behind my back/think I'm weird/ hate me, so I don't really like to socialize much with them. These fears are irrational, probably, because I know they'd never do something like that, but the thought's still there. And I pretty much avoid doing anything that requires effort, like projects and research, or, god-forbid, *research projects*.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't really know what to do. I want to get help, but at the same time, I don't, because I've heard horror stories of people going to therapy, and again, I'm paranoid. Wow. Excessive use of commas, whoops. Sorry for the long post.",10Sep2018,1
38,"First off, I am really uncomfortable with publicity. My partner was involved in a news story a while ago and he agreed to speak to a lot of tabloids. The first thing that made me uncomfortable was that the foundations of his story were dishonest. I don't want to get too specific, but there was a fundamental lie in what he was saying, which would have attracted a huge amount of criticism if found to be true. I believe in karma and that lies eventually unfold, so I disapproved of him speaking with the tabloids because I thought it could only be bad in the long run. I also personally think tabloids are cheap and generally for cheap people, so I didn't agree with the idea too much anyway. The first time, I was upset but he said there would be no more publicity and it all blew over within a week. Just to be clear - I am not in the public eye at all. It is only him. 

&amp;#x200B;

But here we are again, he is back in the news again, sharing some of his personal details that I feel uncomfortable with. In the past 2 weeks, he came to me for advice about whether he should update the press or not on the story, and I told him definitely not. It involved sharing another personal detail which I believe could put him at potential risk of losing his job. But alas, he went ahead with it. It makes me feel like he doesn't care at all for my opinion or he doesn't respect it. He told me that a woman from the press (who he keeps very close contact with) betrayed his trust and published details about him, but from the news articles it seems he was engaged in an interview. I asked him to break contact with this woman today and he replied that he would instead have a serious talk with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, he is very aware that having him in the publicity DESTROYS my mental health. I don't know if I'm being reasonable or not. Like today, I had a whole day of work planned but I feel crippled by crying and panic attacks. Whenever I try to express my feelings, he accuses me of trying to start a fight or not supporting him. Maybe I should care a lot less than I do but it seems he doesn't respect how strongly I feel about this. Another reason I feel so strongly about it is the fact today is also the annivesary of a friend who was killed in a fire and he is also in the news and tabloids. I keep thinking that my friend would never want to be in the tabloids even if you paid him, but he had no choice after his death. But my partner *chooses* to put himself in the news and attract lots of (some good, some bad) publicity. It just makes me feel sick that random people in the comments are voicing their opinion about my partner and my friend's private situations.

My Brother had it all. Advanced Intelligence, a solid friendship group, achievable goals and a whopping level of confidence. He was happy, tried hard in his school work, had big goals for himself and his future. 

In a sudden turn of events that all changed.

Somewhere along that journey of his, he hit a speed bump and his life was turned upside down.

He had high levels of anxiety for a year and changes in year twelve and moving houses ultimately lead him to be diagnosed with sudden onset major depression.

Mental illness will affect approximately one in every two australians in their lifetime. 

A government funded study in 2015 found that almost one in seven children aged between four and seventeen had experienced a mental disorder in the past 12 months.

&amp;#x200B;

This begs the question... 

What mental health support is there in the macedon ranges, and is there enough?

&amp;#x200B;

Highschool is an especially stressful time. We are completing the hardest work we’ve ever had to do, and are trying to set ourselves up for the future. It can all become too much sometimes. Students get into bad habits and find it difficult to make good decisions for themselves. An english teacher currently teaching at my highschool mentioned that in his previous school “a particular boy would  not come to school when a specific class or deadline was on because he found it so stressful”, this is a problem many teenagers face. They need the proper guidance to get back on track. 

School takes up the vast majority of our lives up until adulthood. With so much time being spent at these facilities,  there needs to be accessible support at school  for children in need. Often there is not.

Many schools have designated counsellors but often, as is the case with teacher x's previous school , this person “would just pop up occasionally and wasn't really a part of the students life”. 

If a student really needed to talk to the counsellor and they weren’t there what are they expected to do!

You cannot have part time mental health support, that is not appropriate care. 

The majority of schools lack the support needed and do not do the appropriate thing for their students.

&amp;#x200B;

 A perfect example of this is how they dealt with my brother, Jake. When he expressed that he was suffering with a mental illness, they weren’t inclined to do anything. They  missed phone calls, ignored emails and gave him no support whatsoever other than to see the school counsellor which he wasn't comfortable to do in front of peers. In Jake's words “They took too long to respond and  were almost abrasive. They  wanted me out or back in the system and didn’t want to solve the problem”. He  was not appropriately cared for, and was treated as an asset and not the human being he is. This lack of support ultimately lead to it being a terrible place to be for him to be and he thought it best he terminate his attendance. 

The school that Jake and myself (for two years) went to was your typical high achieving zoned public high school. For those not in the zone they offered a select entry program. Jake was accepted into this program through interviews and testing. The focus is on high academic achievement.

&amp;#x200B;

My high school in the Macedon Ranges. The school adopts the philosophy of  ‘no excluding’. This creates a safe space for students to be themselves and have confidence. Sleepovers are run on campus once a week that give everyone the opportunity to catch up on work, assist with resilients, extend friendships, helps to develop autonomy with the teachers and creates a safe space for those needing to have some time away from home. There is no school counselor as the belief is that you should feel comfortable to go talk to any teacher. Everyone is willing and able to support you. Teacher x and a few other teachers are currently taking part in a mental health program run by A.R . 

&amp;#x200B;

When asked if there was enough support in the macedon ranges, A.R, a youth worker from the shire answered with “No! Absolutely not!”  The geography of living in semi rural areas such as Macedon ranges makes it hard to get around and seek support. So the support needs to be flexible and able to go to the young person in need. Programs are in place  such as the community mental health team, they offer a child and adolescent mental health service. These services that are offered, aren’t as reliable as they need to be. The opening hours are usually nine to five as well as being located in Kyneton and Gisborne, and as A.R pointed out this is impractical for teenagers that are still trying to stay in school and assumes that your able to get to those places.  

The conversation with A.R brought to light some of the issues that are faced with school based counsellors. Many students in need of help will not go see this councillor for numerous reasons. Number one, for the fear of being judged by the other students of the school and creating a stigma for themselves. Being seen going into the counselors office is not an option for some. Seeking help outside of school is the preferred option of many as to keep there school life normal. Going to school is often a chance to get away from yourself and not focus on the issues in your personal life. Schools in the macedon ranges are taking part in a program called live4life. This teaches students what mental health and wellbeing is, how to invest in their own mental health and wellbeing and how to help look after others who are struggling. This education starts in year 8 and finishes in year 11. A.R says “We’ve had a lot of success” and that 2 other locations are trying to replicate live4life in their own rural districts.

&amp;#x200B;

As Australians we need to ask ourselves what legacy we are leaving for future generations? 

Australia is among the countries with the highest suicide rate. Our mental health sector is grossly underfunded and under resourced.

Mental health is everything, it is the whole soul of each human. 

It’s so important for you to find the appropriate help that you need and to find that person/people that will help you back onto your way. For some people that is their parents. Have a chat with them, the love a parent has for their children is “unshakable”. It may not be a parent, maybe a teacher, mentor, coach, or friend. Everybody has their battle scars, you may think somebody has/had no issues but if you just try to talk to them you may discover that they have/had been in the the boat with you the whole journey.

My brother opened up to those that love him, He didn't want to live everyday feeling way he felt. He is now on the road to recovery. 

Being mentally ill is a crippling life, and nobody should have to feel so helpless and unhappy.

None of us come into the world that way, we are full of so much life and happiness.

Let’s live everyday with hope for tomorrow and help those in the dark back up into the light. 

We are stronger together

I understand that OCD is not just hating messy things and always washing hands. Please read some of my symptoms!

[Emails/Social Media]
I have about five emails, each with different uses like personal school etc. But sometimes I have this feeling that I have to log in into all of them and make sure that I remember the password. It’s this little bug in my ear and I don’t stop thinking about my emails and social media and I have to log in every month to change the password, and even then I keep thinking about it.

[Excessive Washing]
After using the restroom, I have to wash my feet. It’s...a little weird. I will keep thinking about it and not put my feet on my bed when I’m laying down till I washed my feet. I tried to ignore it but it wouldn’t go away. Even in public, I keep thinking about it till I go home and washed my feet.

[Anime/Cartoons/Music]
I keep thinking I forgot the things I watched, and I actually have a little list of what I watched. But every time I watch a show, I keep thinking,” are you forgetting a show?” And I have to keep pausing to check my list.

[My Art]
I like to draw. But I keep thinking that I lost a sketchbook, lost a digital piece I’ve done. So I have to check my sketchbook and flip every page to see the drawings and make sure they are there(?) I have to check my Google drive to make sure that all my pieces are backed up, and even look through my gallery to make sure I didn’t miss anything.

51,"This is probably a symptom of social anxiety, when I went to therapy my therapist said I have reactive depression and some kind of anxiety disorder due to negative experiences, a bad enviroment etc

I noticed I am really self conscious about how people perceive me in social settings and I always worry people think I am awkward or people laugh at me etc

This had some basis because it happened to me in the past and right now I tend to overanalyse people's behaviors.

For example today it was the 1st day of school and I got in a new class. I only knew 1 person there and not very much, I didn't say hi at first but at some point I noticed he was looking at me and it seemed like he was saying hi with a nod so I did it but he started snickering (not necessarly in a malicious way since people in class joke around with each other or even with teachers) and kept glancing at me as he talked with the guy who sat next to me with a grin on his face.

I barely know this dude but he went with a trip with us a year and a half ago when I was in another class where people kinda (emotionally) bullied me and he knows all these people.
I didn't have a really nice reputation for a while, I was known for being strange, awkward, silent, introverted, reserved or even ditzy or dumb (because anxiety makes me look like a dumbass sometimes but it isn't super terrible).

He didn't talk to me or anything, he and his friend ignored me after that so I am not sure what was the nature of that behavior, the first days are generally awkward and very few presented themselves in class. The girl who sat next to me barely said anything so it depends on the person idk

How can I overcome this? I always tend to obsess as the time passes and I worry my looks have to do something with it.

The school is full of average people tbh, I am not surrounded by models so it might be the way I present myself?

I still have braces but I dress well, wear some make up, take care of my hygiene, I only wear glasses while studying/reading, I don't have any offputting behaviors etc but I am very self conscious about my looks. I always worry people find me ugly/unattractive/weird/awkward/nerdy etc

When I posted in r/amiugly people said I am cute and on the average side but some didn't like my looks at all for some traits (nose and jawline mostly).
I know this is normal and many said I am decently attractive but I still obsess etc",10Sep2018,26

I don't understand half of them, and they're so stressful and tiring and I don't know what to do about them. I'm often called emotionally dense by my friends and stuff, despite being expressive when concerning positive emotions, but negative emotions shut me down on the outside and make me feel like I'm going to have a meltdown on the inside. Like, I don't know what to do.

Unfortunately, the best way I can cope with it is either repetitively rocking or pacing or, worse, tugging at my hair until it hurts or cutting myself. I've found cutting distracts the best and does it's job. I don't want to die, but I want to detract from feeling emotions because *they're so stressful and they're too overwhelming*. It's so bad. I'm stuck. I've been cutting my arm more than ever due to college stress and now I have *relationship* stress and just stress in general and I feel like I'm going to *implode*.

I often find myself rocking or fidgeting more often than not nowadays. It's getting pretty bad...

What should I do? I don't know what's wrong with me. I mean, I've always hated emotions and found them too overwhelming and overstimulating, almost? But never this bad. Before, I could handle quite a bit. Now, though, if someone even makes a loud noise around me I curl into myself and want to cover my ears and just disappear and it's so bad. I'm so stressed.

What do I do...? What the hell is wrong with me? Is this an anxiety disorder or something?

Sometimes during the day it just comes into my mind.

My family has a history of cancer. My mother died of pancreatic cancer. Uncle died of throat cancer. Cousin died of leukemia Cousin now has stage 4 breast cancer. All from my mother's side.

Already went to the hospital a couple of times to get checked out but they found nothing wrong. Had ultrasound, gastroscopy, colonoscopy and blood tests done.

My LDL is high, that's the only concern from my blood tests. 

I have a happy family. I'm 37 years old. I have 2 boys 3 and 5 years old. Trying for a girl.

I have generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and PTSD. I was on 3 different SSRI's and I lost my facilities on all 3. They put me on Buspar/ Busiprone now and I am having horrible side effects.

About 30 minutes after taking it, I get a horrible headache, dizziness, start sweating, and feel like I am going to throw up. It is like when you drink too much and your forehead gets really hot and you have the spins. The only thing my body and brain want to do is go lay down and close my eyes forever. 

But the weird thing is, after about an hour of this, I feel 100%. I feel amazing. The drug works wonders for my anxiety but I have to go through this twice a day. I almost fear having to take my next dose just because of that one hour.

58,"A quick cover of the past

For the last 4 year's I have been in a very low point in my life, no I have NOT diagnosed with depression, bipolar, any MPDs, anxiety etc. But I have done some 'silly' things in the past that I'm not proud of and I've had extreme lows and some highs and right now I'm not coping well at all. I'm 17 almost 18 and in college.

So 3 weeks ago I started to feel really shitty all of a sudden and very low, it was sudden and from what I remember had no reason to begin it just happened, as it does, a week later my girlfriend says she needs some time to herself since we have spent most of the summer together so she can spend time with her Mum, Dad and family etc which I fully understood that makes sense, I appreciate that and I'm not gonna stop her cos that's wrong and why would I, it's her family! But at this point when she said this I was in a pretty low state and could immediately tell, my mood is gonna keep dropping and I don't know when it will stop. So the week goes through, I message her etc and get the odd reply,

I'm feeling low, anxiety is on a high, she isn't replying for 6+ hours, I'm having stressful, lonely, depressed nights with thoughts rushing through my head, I'm feeling like shit, I'm getting very little sleep, my girlfriend isn't talking to me much, I have no friends or family to spend time with or see, I'm feeling shit, this goes on for a week and then it's Sunday 9th (yesterday). 

My worst day and night for a almost a year and a half.

The day starts off... Okay, not great, not shit, just okay. My girlfriend is replying to me every so often, my mood is not too low, I'm coping alright. The day goes on and my mood starts to drop, I can tell things are getting worse, I try talking to my girlfriend but she doesn't help, I try coping myself but I make matters 10× worse. It's then 9 p.m. I'm home alone 100%, my mind is rushing with impulsive thoughts and I'm battling them and they're too much I'm there, panicking, breathing too fast to cope and I don't know what to do, I call my girlfriend's brother in the hope for some help and after half an hour he persuades me not to do anything. My girlfriend then calls me and we have a 40 minute talk and she almost breaks up with me. But I sort things out. She has a lot going on herself with her family and things aren't great and I understood that she doesn't need my shit on top of the news she has, I tell her I will sort myself out and stop, and make things better and I tell her I will prove it to her, and we are still together. 

My mental health is destroying me and has been for 4 years, it's destroyed all my friendships and left me with nobody and now it's not only destroying me it's destroying my relationship and I don't know what the fuck to do I just need someone to talk to, a friend, someone that will understand and accept me for who I am and be willing to listen and help. I want to help people too I want to make people feel wanted and feel like they deserve a place on this planet, but I'm struggling to do that when right now my mental health is ruining me.",10Sep2018,1

62,"Hello, my mother is suffering from paranoia and delusions. The Psychiatrist won't be available till Friday. I took her to a general physician and he spoke to a psychiatrist and prescribed some medicines for the meantime. 

She's only scared and anxious. She's not doing anything out of the ordinary. We are Maldivians living in Sri Lanka. My Mom doesn't speak the local language.   We have neighbors who are always shouting and  arguing loudly. My Mom thinks they are talking about her. She is certain they are going to sue her / rob her/ harass her. She is NOT hearing voices or seeing things. Only when the neighbors speak (in a different language) she gets scared.. Both languages are related but not mutually intelligible.  DOES THIS COUNT AS AUDITORY HALLUCINATION? 

She is religious and she thinks people hate her religion and want to hurt her for it.  I ask her not to pray and hid all the religious stuff in the house.  I feel awful about it  but it was making her more and more anxious.

I listen to her and try to reason with her, explain her things. I give her articles about paranoia and delusions to read.  She seems fine when the neighbors are quiet.. 

I love my Mom very much. My Dad died when i was a little. She raised me and my sister without any assistance from others. Seeing her like this is killings me.

63,"I’m not writing this post for sympathy. I had a conversation with a friend today and she highlighted a problem and that Men don’t know how to express their feelings, so I thought it may help for me to gather them up here and try to make a point that talking or expressing yourself can be cathartic.

Basically on Friday night my wife left, saying that she didn’t love me the same anymore. There was no cheating on my behalf, and she was my world. I put her first in everything I did.

We’d been under a bit of stress for the past 9 months, getting burgled, moving house twice subsequently, both of us finding out that we can’t have kids, and me losing my job. 

I’d never been good with money and we lived pay check to pay check. I was out of work for a month, and with nothing saved, we were up shit street, but we care out the other side and we came up with plans to put away some savings and pay off debts (not massive debts, about 7k)

After months of little arguments and failure to communicate on both sides, she announced that she was leaving. I never thought it would ever get to that point but it did and she left.

I spent the weekend getting really stoned both alone and with friends, but all in an effort to not confront the impending doom.

Then today I decided to tell one of her good friends whom she’d lost contact with. She immediately dropped everything and told me to meet her for a coffee. I really didn’t want to move from the comfort of my 4 walls, but I dragged my ass up and out and met up with her. 

Whilst I told her a lengthier version of what I’ve just described above, she told me that one of her husbands had just killed himself and none of them knew that there was anything wrong. She also said that her husbands never spoken about his emotions in the way that I did to her.

This made me realise what a problem we have. We as men do not know how to deal with pain and suffering in a healthy way.

Now that I’m home, to be honest i don’t feel much better, but the time I was there, in the coffee shop, it made me feel like I was inside my own body again and that I could get through this.

I just hope that if someone reads this who may be going through something similar, it’s ok to talk. Especially if it’s someone who’s not in your close group of friends. Just someone who’ll listen to you. I can’t promise it will help or make things easier, but it definitely provide you either a temporary shelter from the storm, or maybe just the realisation that things suck, and that they’re going to be like that for a while, but you will come out the other side.",10Sep2018,174

I have a GP that I see regularly and a psychologist, as well as being on medication, but I still feeling as though I’m navigating this whole thing on my own.

73,"Hello, r/mentalhealth. Today I'm here to see if you can help me with what I think is a hell of a problem.

​

You see, I'm someone - mostly - with an organized mind so that I do well in school. One might actually say that those two things aren't at all connected. I wouldn't know what to answer. I've just held on to this idea because it's the only thing that makes me believe that I'm not so messed up as sometimes I think I am.

Still, I can't shake the idea that something is really wrong with me, and since I will not have therapy any time soon (as in years) I figured I could get something from you, I guess.

​

I've always been especially sentimental. I've given meaning to most things I have (I guess not having much also is also something to blame for). My memories were/are no different. I found myself panicking the first time I realized that the number of memories I had from my childhood could fit in one of my hands - as in no more than 5. I was about 12 by that time. Not long has passed since then, and I haven't got much else. You see, I'll have really heartfelt moments and others I just really want to remember to cherish, but still, I merely have a grasp at their idea. No smells, no sounds, no physical sensations, few emotions. I just don't know what to do because every time I hear someone slightly older saying something like ""Oh! We spent the day talking about our childhood and out memories"" I can't help to look back and feel like I have never felt, or lived. Just emptiness - besides the 'gas memories' (as I call them) and, of course, the stigma life got me.

​

I just wanna look back and remember that I was happy and sad. How it was, and why it was. To understand myself better and understand who I was and what I'm going to become, just as what I currently am. It's not fair that others have something to look back to and I don't.

But often time I kinda wish I had something traumatic happen to me.

also I sometimes want to show and hide my self harm scars at the same time but I never Show them to not upset my friends.

I have fantasies where I'm just visiting a doctor or etc. then the guy locks the door or something and starts well. raping me, this is hard for me to write/admit.

I had a fantasy of one of my best friend's Boyfriend raping me and me having to lie to her GF to keep their relationship healthy etc. then I eventually breakdown (I'm suuuuper bad at hiding stuff and I act so obvious when I'm hiding stuff) then she'd eventually find out. the thing is in almost ALL of those fantisies I break down cry, and someone (strangely always a woman) tells me it's alright hugs and me and etc. sometimes I hurt myself in them or attemp suicide (never attempted but think a lot about it)

&amp;#x200B;

why do I think about all this. they are in no way ""fun"" for me and put a lot of tension stress on me, I want it to happen still in a way.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I need an excuse to feel the way I am ? most my friends had something traumatic happen to me, My life wasn't perfect, but I was far from abused/Traumatized, I have had zero sexual experiences let alone being abused. They act a lot better than me, I don't know if they're dong better (it seems from my impression) but I'm all over their face with my problems and I can't control it and I feel guilty. I feel like I shouldn't be doing this, they're the ones deserving to be sad

&amp;#x200B;

also I deal with a ton of self hate specially during my episodes, maybe I feel like I deserve it and I wanna punish myself?

75," 

I am a recent college graduate from 2017, and I have been struggling with depression following graduation. A large portion of this is due to my belief I am drastically under performing compared to my peers. I am writing to this post to see if you guys think I'm valid in thinking I'm under performing.

About Me: 2017 graduate of a small liberal arts college with a BA Political Science. I worked for 2 years in a marketing department during school and summers. In college, I was social chairman for my Fraternity. Currently, I work for a third party administrator that processes life insurance claims. My job is to call life insurance companies to see what they need from us to be paid on the policy. My salary is 30K a year and will be going up to around 32-33K after I hit my one year anniversary. I live in the Midwest so this salary is livable if budgeted correctly.

I wake up every morning and feel a lack of purpose, and feel as if I have not contributed anything to the world. Then I see friends I went to school with who are traveling, getting married, getting job promotions, and I while I am happy for them, I get a sense of dread that I have made a terrible mistake somehow. I do realize a lot of these friends come from a more privileged family life, but I personally feel this is a cop out for my inadequacy. I've applied for jobs in cities around the country, mostly in non profit or office type jobs. ( At least I'd be somewhere new and broke.) I have not received any hits on these either. Yes, I have applied to government, think tank, etc jobs as well with no hits. This is mostly due to no experience because I spent my time in college working in a marketing department. No other marketing department seems to want to hire me as well, due to lack of skill set, or experience.

I still live at home as well, holding on to some hope that I will get a job somewhere new. I do not want to move and get locked into a lease, and then finally get that job offer and not be able to afford paying for two rents by getting locked into the previous lease. So, I'm writing this to see if you guys thinks I'm under performing or if this is normal ( I honestly don't know.) Any tips would be appreciated as well. I can post my resume, as well. Please only CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, I don't need to mess up my mental state any more than it is! I feel I am making way less, and not living life compared to my peers.",10Sep2018,1

I am currently training as a Clinical Psychologist at the University of East London and as part of my doctoral degree, I am carrying out some important research that I hope you can help me with. Unusual experiences (e.g. hearing voices), unusual beliefs and paranoia are common. These experiences are often associated with past experiences and memories from childhood and adolescence. I am interested in your experiences and memories and would like to invite you to take part in my study. I am keen to hear from everyone; however these unusual experiences make you feel. It is hoped that this study will be valuable in providing information that could help improve approaches to psychological assessment and intervention that are intended to enhance the well-being of people who have psychotic type experiences and high levels of shame, in a non-pathologising way. 

You must be aged over 18, living in the UK and have a degree of fluency in English to participate in this study. If you would like to participate, you will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires via a secure online survey,to which there are no right or wrong answers.These should take approximately 30-40 minutes.

My boyfriend is a hardcore gamer and therefore he plays a lot- we live together and we work together and usually do stuff togsther throughout the week, but in my mind I still feel secondbest to the games, I try not to act crazy and I usually never say anything about it because I feel like I'm being unresonable, but even if I were to say something I don't know how to say it/know exactly what's wrong. I moved out of my parents house when I was 18 because my parents and I would not stop arguing and its been over a year now and things are better but I still get sad. And no matter how much I try to help my best friend to make the right decisions in life she just won't do anything to fix her problems, she has the most toxic boyfriend and friends around her and does nothing about it, but then complains all the time to me about it. Sorry if this is TMI.... I just wanna know if I can find some answers as to why I'm really sad.",10Sep2018,1

83,"So about 3 years ago my family finally lost the home due to family issues and my mom's schizophrenia appearing and becoming a lot worse. My dad went to China, I went to college and my sister was still in college. So my mom was alone because well her mental issues made it hard for other people to help her. My aunt tried to help early on, but my mom was very violent and uncooperative. So she became homeless and has been that way for a few years. She will call me constantly for a place to live, but the problem is, no one will take her in due to her mental illness. She is very, very destructive. She's even banned from many hotels that we've tried to let her stay in to get some rest. She will literally have the police being called on her within a day or 2 of living at a hotel. Every time my sister and I try to help her find a place to live, she refuses to take medicine. I let her know that it isn't possible for her to live anywhere permanently if she's the way she is, no one will let her stay. She still refuses to take medicine. But everytime she calls me, my mind hurts. Everytime i think about her being in the streets, I cant focus. It's like to the point where I cannot really live my life due to this. It stresses me out so much and has been for like the past 5-6 years even when we had a house still. My mental state is not in a good place and I do not know what to do... ",10Sep2018,1
84,"Today is World Suicide Prevention Day. In honor of that, I’m sharing a speech I made in 2012 that shares a tiny part of my story. You never know who might be struggling. Don’t be afraid to talk to others about their mental health and how they’re doing. End the stigma. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and is nothing to be ashamed of. So grateful to be free of clinical depression now, for about 8-9 years now. I’m grateful that I had people around me who checked on me and didn’t let me give up when I was so close to doing so. If you’re struggling, I know how hard it is to believe that it will get better. I know that you feel no hope. I also know that these feelings are temporary. Keep fighting. Get help. Talk to me or anyone you trust. Never ever give up. Stay.

85,"Hi, I usually just read on Reddit, this is my first post. Considering it affects me every day now, I thought it was time to reach out in some way. I’m a 22 year old girl struggling with a self hatred issue regarding my appearance. 

I have this habit of bullying myself for my aesthetic flaws, manically and uncontrollably. I think this is a pretty common issue for girls my age and for people in general, but it’s starting to affect other aspects of my life. 

These bullying sessions that come on are random and intense and it’s resulted in crying at work, tension between my boyfriend and I, parents, friends and family being concerned. It usually goes by telling myself I’m ugly, that everyone thinks I’m ugly, and the ones who say different just don’t want to hurt my feelings. I’ll be sitting at my desk at work and completely randomly start thinking about how fat I probably look to all my coworkers right at that moment. Then I get wildly insecure and want to hide. I sometimes look into mirrors and pick myself apart until I sob and want to do nothing but stay home wishing I was someone else. 

I have the best boyfriend in the world. This is the most  passionate, healthy relationship I’ve ever been in, and I know how into me he is. However, there is often an unwelcome voice in my head telling me he’s lying. He’s just saying these things about how perfect he thinks I am because he doesn’t think he can do better for some reason. That he’s just saying nice things to make me feel good because he feels bad for me. That he thought his exes were hotter, better in bed. It makes me hate myself even more. And even as understanding with this issue as he is, it’s gotten to the point where I think he’s slightly offended that I can’t believe him yet.

And I even know deep down that this is all ridiculous because I’m head over heels in love, with a loving family, and supportive friends. I’m healthy and fortunate in many ways, I shouldn’t hate myself like this. But sometimes I can’t help these horrible thoughts. 

Does anyone have any coping mechanisms for self hatred, possibly for body dysmorphia related feelings? Warding off the evil, bullying voice in my head? I don’t want my pessimistic views on my body to hurt my relationship or control me anymore. ",10Sep2018,1
86,"Half of the time I can go through my day and pretend I'm not sick, function normally, and just be myself. And the other half of the time it's glaringly obvious that something is deeply wrong with me. 

I guess I'm just feeling down on myself. The other day I was at work and someone in the kitchen dropped a pan, and the noise was so loud that I froze and almost started crying in the middle of the walkway. For those few moments I was filled with an overwhelming sense of dread, of fear, that something awful was about to happen. Sometimes I get lucky and forget I have PTSD for a little bit, but then I'm reminded it's always there. It's always going to be there, it's not something I can escape. In moments like these I feel so weak and so helpless. 

Mental illness is like a shape shifter, I suppose. Some days it's small, just something scurrying across the floor unnoticed. Other days it's a wave big enough to swallow a city, to just utterly and completely drown you. I know this feeling is universal, I know that, I just wanted to get it out and off my chest.

87,"I’m in a classic anxious/avoidant attachment  type of close friendship that is very emotionally triggering for me.

I’m the anxious one and the other tends to be more on the narcissistic/avoidant spectrum.

If I were to be judged strictly on the basis of my reactions to this relationship, I would match all of the criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder (minus suicide idealization and self mutilating behaviors.)      

The splitting (all good/all bad,) the strong emotional responses (high or low,) the enmeshment of myself into the other person on an emotional level.  I tend to lose my sense of self within the context of the relationship.

The thing is I typically don’t exhibit these symptoms in my other long-standing relationships.   I tend to be secure in them.   I feel supported and connected in my closest relationships with friends and family.    There might be disagreements or arguments just like in any relationship but I am able to maintain a feeling of constancy and I don’t fall apart emotionally.   I feel balanced, with a strong sense of self outside of the relationship context.

But in the relationship in question, I “lose” myself in that I lose sight of my separateness in my desire to seek an emotional connection with someone who is not able to show it in return.   It’s like I have to carry all the emotions for both of us (and they’re usually the negative ones.).   I feel like I’m chasing an elusive carrot that’s dangled in front of me.   There are moments  of genuine closeness, followed invariably by a withdrawal and aloofness.   This prompts a huge emotional reaction from me.   My reaction is way over the top and doesn’t fit the situation at all.    It’s a gut wrenching ordeal that can take a long time to recover from.  Feelings of self loathing, inadequacy and shame.    There is also rage at both myself and the other person.   

There’s  some kind of pathology going on because I have just kept returning and returning for more of this cycle (more than six years.) 

I guess my basic question is: can the dynamic between two people be such that the individual reactions can  mimic that of someone with a personality disorder?

I’m not asking for a diagnosis here at all.   But I really would appreciate thoughtful feedback,

92,"I'm a 15 year old from the United Kingdom, My behavioural issues began at age 8, I would regularly cuss out my teachers and peers in primary school. When I hit age 9 is when the violence began, I would get into almost weekly fights with friends, random people and sometimes teachers. It got so bad that I was excluded from school for 3 full weeks. This continued till the end of primary school and by the time I was entering high school I had 13 suspensions under by belt (Something i'm not proud of.) All primary 7 pupils got to go visit their local high school as a teaser for what's to come and me being me I started playing on my phone in the science class, the teacher rightfully told me off and I told her to fuck off and die. This got me suspended from the visit and they said that they're reconsidering my placement in their school. I then have a meeting half way through summer with the headteacher, We both agreed that my behaviour was unacceptable and I apologised with  promise that I would never do it again. Day 1 of highschool rolls around and me and my ""friend"" get into a scuffle with 3 older boys, this goes unnoticed. Later that day I meet a person who I would've at the time considered an enemy, upon seeing the boy I on impulse ran up to him and smashed his head against a bookshelf causing A LOT of blood. I'm told to wait outside of the classroom while he is attended to, I ignore the instructions and go downstairs into the main hall where I am unintentionally greeted by the same headmaster who I had the meeting with not 3 weeks prior. I explain what happened and he seemed surprisingly nonchalant about the incident and told me to do better for the rest of the day, I did. The next few weeks were fine, A few verbal disputes here and there but no big deal. Then around a month into school I stab someone with some thumb tacks from the teachers desk causing a great deal of blood. I'm suspend for the first time. I come back 1 week later and everything is fine for a few days until I meet a boy in the bathroom who had transferred from another local school due to bullying (I know the boy) I started having  a civilised conversation with him and out of nowhere and totally without provocation I take my tie of and begin to choke him with it and I  bang his head on the sink. I believe he was unconscious though I am unsure. 2 hours later i'm identified as the assaulter. I get excluded from school for 2 weeks and i'm charged with assault. I get back into school and after 5 more suspensions and 1 more assault charge I am transferred to a school where I know close to no one and the people I do know hate me. On the second day of my new school (I'm in my second year of highschool at this point) I am locked into a room by a teacher to prevent me and another boy from fighting. I call the teacher a fucking slut and kick her in the knee caps. I get suspended for 5 days. I come back and it only takes 2 weeks for me to get into 2 fights in 30 minutes (I damaged 1 boys nose but I was let off the hook.)  Again after a bunch more suspensions I am referred to a psychologist and I am sent to a school for people with behavioural issues. I know quite a few people there so I figured everything would be okay (It was.) On my first day of the new school I get to know all the people I don't know and I greet the people I do know. The place doesn't live up to it's stigma, no stabbings no guns and no drugs. The fire alarm was set off a bunch of times though. It didn't take long for things to go sour, I stopped attending and got argumentative with the teachers. I refused to come into school without 100% conformation that I was aloud to play football everyday. (This is year 3 of highschool now.) Eventually the headteacher had enough of my slacking and took the ball away. After chasing after him trying to get the ball we arrive at the gym closet where the balls are kept and i'm trying to barge past him put he just won't budge, this results in a punch to the face for him and a suspension for me. This was in December I haven't attended the school since and I am welcome back at any time. I have however been attending the psychologist sessions and after extensive analysis he concluded that my issues were, Conduct disorder, ADHD and  
 Pathological Demand  avoidance. The thing with this diagnosis is I failed to mention my extreme paranoia and that being the reason I haven't spoken to or met up with any of my friends for 1 year and 2 months. The Conduct Disorder I can accept also the ADHD. Put the pda was a misdiagnosis and it was my fault, see I tried to study Aspergers Syndrome and I tried to replicate the condition in hopes for a diagnosis. My reasoning for this is that autistic people tend to get some leeway and I intended to use my ""Autism"" As an excuse for my bad behaviour. I was very deceptive and manipulative to the point were if I tell him that I tricked him he would probably think that I am in denial or ashamed which has really fucked me up because my very prevalent auditory and visual hallucinations have only amplified since my isolation and it is something I have kept secret from everyone. Examples of my weird behaviour that I keep under raps - Avoiding entering rooms when possible, Having the light off in every room, sleeping as far against the wall as possible, sitting all the way at the back of any room with my back against the wall, drinking nothing but water from a tap, not consuming prescribed ritilan in fear of the pills being laced and just not trusting any living human on earth, not even myself. I intend to make up a story about how I am being abused at home so I can be taken away and transferred into a care home where I can hopefully meet some people with relatable situations and common sense about the world we live in. A change of pace is well needed, no 15 year old should feel extremely suicidal and empty on a daily basis. Any advice you can offer would mean a lot and If I was to vague or my speech was to scattered feel free to ask me anything and i'll elaborate.



In anticipation for potential question-


Have you ever harmed animals - Yes. I won't incriminate myself but yes multiple times.

Do you plan on killing anyone if you do ever commit suicide - No. Probably not, there's a possibility I would set up a facebook account of a child and catch a pedophile, I would then meet up with the pedophile and kill him then myself. That's something I have always wanted to do but I probably won't do it.

Do you experience empathy? Not really. My only ""Soft spot"" is babies it would take a lot of money for me to execute a baby but as for people my age or older I only really treat them as stepping stones to get to my main objective in life (Money and power.) 

Were you abused as a child? Yes. I experienced emotional neglect in my early years as well as bullying (Ironic) I was also abused sexually multiple times by adult men and late people in their late teens when I was 8-11. 

Have you abused someone sexually? I guess technically at ages 7-9 but the people were my age and a lot of it was consensual typically with other boys. The things that could be classed as sexual abuse would normally just be me trying to dry hump someone at age 7. My justification is I was never taught right from wrong by my ""Parents""



Thanks for any help guys, I'm mainly looking for your prospective, Am I autistic?, am I schizophrenic?, Do I have conduct disorder?, do I have ADHD?, Do I need to get help? If so what kind? Thanks guys and I apologise if the message was all over the place.",10Sep2018,1

Weeks worth of dirty plates are piling up at my place. I had to get more plates. It smells horrible. Food is rotting, flowers dying. I found a dead mouse :(


I haven't been social for weeks. I leave my house everyday only when it's dark to go on a walk for 1hr and get some food if needed. Now my legs hurt so much, some muscle injury in my calves. I can't walk anymore even at a snails pace. Now I'm isolated at my place.


Despite all this, I had a visitor. I had to take a shower. And clean the bathroom and brush my teeth. It was ok. We did the things I can't do, going for a walk and headed back to my place :(


He said he cares a lot about my pleasure, immediately tried to fuck me in the ass, came, then apologized for not making me finish, and as I said there was still hope for me, he left.


He said the mess didn't bother him. Now I'm worried about cameras in my home and spyware on my phone. I have a lot of technology at home to be tampered with. I hate to tape all my cameras again :( His revenge.


I started smoking away. Looking for weed and cocaine. Stuff that used to make me feel like a person. But since I don't know anyone it's hard to come by. I know of a member of the flat earth community who can deal, but even I have limits.


Best part of my day is when I max dose the sleeping pills and dream vividly of laughter and happiness and good sex. All those dreams make the occasional horrific nightmare worth it. I sleep until lunchtime. I really don't know what happens after that.


I can't function, I can't make connections. I'm scared of anyone. I'm so lonely. I'm choked. 


That's all folks!

I didn't study, I didn't read any books we were assigned, barely did homework but I always scored high on standardized testing and big projects.

I was still able to graduate with a BSBA with minimal effort and a 3.0 gpa, drinking into a black out or smoking myself into obilvion. Once all the structure in my life was removed, I really fell apart when it came to applying to jobs and other things, unable to focus or care long enough to do anything. My life is perpetual mess and chaos, directionless, erratic, lacking any flow or continuity. Often, I numb myself with marijuana and sometimes alcohol until nothing matters and it feels peaceful. I can't sit still, I can't control my emotions, I can't focus long enough to handle my responsibilities and I have no hope or motivation for the future. I am growing increasingly more depressed at our business failing because I can't get my head right but I lack any will or ability to do anything about it.

97,"I had a girlfriend for about 4 years throughout high school and college. We broke up about a year ago as it was just not working anymore. The first few months after the break up were fine, I enjoyed my freedom. After those first few months however, I really started to feel very lonely and struggled being on my own. I met a new girl around that time and at first we were just casual as I wanted to make sure I was okay on my own, before being with someone else. I ended up caving after a couple months and we started dating. We were super great together, had lots of fun, great conversation and great sex. Throughout the relationship though, I had constant anxiety over the fact that I'm not okay on my own and I wasn't able to fully commit to her. I would get lonely some nights and use her as an escape to feel wanted. I realized this was super toxic and that I couldn't build a good relationship like that. I broke up with her 2 weeks ago because I just couldn't do it anymore. I told her I needed to figure out my own shit before I could take this relationship any further. It was such a tough thing to do, as I loved and deeply cared for this new girl and it killed me to just cut her off. Ever since the breakup I've really been struggling. I think about her constantly and I haven't really improved at all being on my own. I know it takes time, but I'm starting to feel like I won't ever be okay solo and that breaking up with her was not the right thing to do to better my mental health.

I love these guys. I’ve spent lots of years flying solo since I was quite introverted as a younger child. Now, though I’m certainly not a flashy extrovert with hundreds of friends, I’ve become comfortable and more outgoing, and so I talk to them a lot.

However, I talk in class quite frequently about things which aren’t related to the topic, and sometimes I can get quite loud. I’ve never been pulled up about it because I think the classroom atmosphere is quite noisy generally and I don’t stand out, but afterwards I get incredibly self-conscious because I feel I’ve bored my friends.

The same goes online. With Discord, there are quite a few occasions where people don’t really type much; perhaps they’re busy with playing a game or getting work done. I find myself falling into the habit of checking my phone too often for new messages, replying instantly to every message and generally spamming the chat with messages to which I get no replies.

These guys are really awesome to chat to, but because I’m so self-aware of my presentation, I often find myself looking back on my day and wished I hadn’t chat or typed so much.

* What happens to our consciousness after death? If we simply cease to exist, what would that feel like?
* How did we come to exist in such a vast Universe? And how did this Universe of ours come to possess the laws of physics as we know them? What defined the sort of sandbox we live in?
* Are our lives useful at all if we don't leave a positive impact on the world? If I don't leave some sort of legacy behind, would I just be forgotten and ... that's that?

I understand that there are various online forums that answer these sort of questions, and I'm aware that I could possible partake in such debates online. My concern is: Is it normal to be, quite literally, thinking about this stuff non-stop?

I do mean **literally.** For instance, I was having a conversation with a colleague at work today, and while I was speaking, I started having these thoughts and lost concentration. I had to work really hard to get back on track with the conversation. I also stay up practically all night thinking about this stuff, essentially losing valuable hours of sleep.

As a side note, I'm aware that I'm mildly anxious. I've never sought professional help because I always thought that it wasn't necessary and that I'm overreacting. I believe I've come a long way in fighting it but it does become overwhelming at times. I'm not sure if it contributes to my current situation. Some anxiety symptoms which I experience:

* Increased heart rate for no reason at all
* Overthinking most situations to the point of physical and mental exhaustion
* Hands visibly shaking
* Stressing out/overthinking about the least smidget of social interactivity (including with GF, family and close friends)
* Strong desires to be/remain alone and to avoid socialising (even though everything's perfectly fine and there's no reason for me to feel this way)",10Sep2018,3
102,"Hi this is my first post here I think. I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences and maybe can push me in the right direction. I am not looking for diagnoses, no, but I am looking for some direction. 

You can see in my post history something I posted in r/suicidewatch and it doesn’t make a lot of sense. When I am under severe stress, I don’t have control over myself. I tend to forget doing or saying things. Sometimes I do know what I am doing, but I don’t want to do it and I can’t stop it. For example, I got upset while I was on campus and I dragged my arms across the brick walls, making myself bleed. I kept thinking to myself, don’t do this! Why are you doing this! But I feel like in that state I am a very small voice and I don’t have any power.

The main thing I was wondering about though was the disorganized speech and thoughts. In some states my thoughts make absolutely no sense and it’s like word salad. Anyone else experiences this? Sorry, I just calmed down after an episode so this might be a little rambly.",10Sep2018,5

104,"Background: I've been a very emotional person my whole life. I am a people-pleaser, and I care too much what other people think. I've always been quick to cry, and it is almost impossible for me to hold back tears. I also then start having very dramatic thoughts such as ""I'm a true failure. I can't be in this profession."" I feel like this isn't normal, and I don't know what to do. 

Today: I arrived to work earlier than all of my coworkers to work on a project. I really felt confident about it. When it was my turn to present, I was two sentences in when my boss yelled at me in front of my whole team for not knowing what I was talking about. I felt overwhelmed because I had tried SO HARD to be prepared. This was also my first day with this new boss, and all of my team members have been in the job at least two years more than me. I started tearing up and couldn't finish my presentation. This of course made me feel worse, and the whole day felt awful. 

Located in US. Access to many healthcare options, counselors, and I have insurance.

What do I do? Who do I need to see? Is there anyone else who can relate and has advice?",10Sep2018,1
105,"I have never been officially diagnosed but since I smoked weed back when I was 16 everything changed for the worst 

I got severe panic attacks and I lived through a total state of anxiety everyday in my life, getting like 3 or 4 panic attacks per year and dealing with sadness and fear day by day.

I only have two friends but I feel like they are tired of hearing about my problems, when I meet new people I start worrying about what they think about me and I project myself as a clingy of needy person, I haven't met new friends since I moved to another city to live with my SO

Doing dishes and getting the chores done are a daily struggle for me.

And finally, I hear voices in my head, from my mother, friends and other people when I'm about to go to sleep

SO doesn't want me to take meds because I tried to commit suicide overdosing on them two years ago, I feel hopeless.

I'm beginning to think or perceive myself as a mentally ill person ",10Sep2018,2

107,"Someone I care for very deeply is really struggling with her mental health. I encouraged her to start seeing a counselor and she has, they diagnosed her with severe depression and bi polar and have her on a low dose of some meds. Its only been a few week since the process started and having gone through it myself I know its going to be a long road. She so often gets discouraged, and wants to stop fighting. I've dealt with my own mental illnesses, but have never been suicidal so I'm unsure of how to comfort her best when she talks about wanting to kill herself. I don't want to disregard her feelings, or try and guilt her in anyway. 

She doesn't have anyone else, and has stated multiple times that she doesn't know if she'd still be here if it wasn't for me. I'm the type of person who gives 110% to everyone around me, and often run myself ragged trying to help everyone else before thinking about myself. Any response to this is greatly appreciated!",10Sep2018,2

109,"I originally posted this in r/relationshipadvice but I thought I might also find some help here. 

My (21F) boyfriend (20) has had a history of depression for several years, but the semester before we started dating was his lowest point. He has had ups and downs while we’ve been dating (about 8 months) but I can see that he’s starting to go through another low and I’m at a loss as to how to be supportive.
 
I try to send him encouraging texts and remind him of why I love him, but he rarely answers. I don’t want to make him feel guilty and worse about himself for not contacting me so I never text him more than twice a day if he isn’t  answering. At the same time, I worry that he is isolating himself and needs help but won’t reach out. I texted him on Friday and I haven’t heard from him all weekend. It’s Monday now and we have a class together but he didn’t show up. I’m worried about him and I don’t know what the right thing to do is.

When I try to engage him in a discussion about his feelings or what I can do to help he becomes very evasive and tries to change the subject. Again, I don’t want to push him or make him feel worse so I just drop it. He has a therapist so if he needs to talk to someone he has them. It just makes me feel helpless to be able to connect with him.

I’ve had my own struggle with depression so I have an understanding of where he’s coming from, it’s just that we’re different people and what helps me might not help him. I don’t want to push him away or make anything worse. I feel sick from overthinking this and I just want my boyfriend back :(",10Sep2018,1
110,"So I was in a kitchen at school today with my class and there was a big knife sitting on the counter. I stared at it the whole class just day dreaming and fantasizing about picking it up and stabbing someone. No one even did anything to me, I just really wanted to do it. It wasn’t the first time I’ve wanted to do stuff like that for no reason. I looked into it but I really don’t think that I’m a psycho, or that I’m insane in any way. So does anyone else relate? I’d also like to hear your opinions on it if you don’t mind. ",10Sep2018,1
111,"I'm 17. For the last few years i've been hearing these weird, extremely loud screams during sleep, they feel like they were literally in my ears. They don't fully wake me up, i just keep sleeping(though conscious for few seconds) , but i remember that i heard them. They are quite disturbing and i wonder why do i keep hearing them. 

Just to clarify, i've lived in different places and this keeps happening to me anyway so it's not related to my location. Now i live with a roommate who literally sleeps 3m away from me and he didn't hear anything when this happened to me yesterday. ",10Sep2018,2
112,"So, I've struggled with depression for around 5 to 6 years now, and I want to try therapy.

But I need my mum to make a doctors appointment because I think I also need her aprovement for therapy, so what would be the best way to tell her, without making her feel guilty or whatever?",10Sep2018,1
113,"Hi guys - I’m just looking for some advice here. I know that I suffer with anxiety. If I say something stupid of embarrassing it will haunt me for the rest of my life no matter how small! I just feel like it has really gotten on top of me the last few weeks to the point where I’m avoiding my family because I think I’ve upset them, even though they haven’t said anything to that effect. Does anyone have any advice on dealing with this? I’m not keen on medicating as I’m on a lot of meds for other physical health problems and feel like a rattle when I walk anyway! I feel like I have an ever growing list of people I need to avoid even though they probably couldn’t care less.... some of these people are my best friends I wouldn’t want to lose but I’m not responding to texts as I’m assuming they’re texting to pull me up about something. ",10Sep2018,1
114,"So I've just moved back in with my mother after a long period of living elsewhere. Its been two days and I'm going crazy already. I can't get a wink of sleep because of her talking to the voices in her head and the house and her are in a horrible state. There are mouse droppings everywhere and the bills haven't been paid in months so there's no electricity or gas. I honestly dont know how she's been surviving. I feel like the best thing for her would be to be sectioned but I doubt the authorities would do this since she's not a danger to anyone. Really unsure of what to do. She won't discuss her medication with me and I have no idea what she's supposed to be taking or if she's taking it (probably not)

The lack of sleep is the worst thing for me. She literally talks throughout the whole night, to people who aren't there.",10Sep2018,1
115,"I have an employee, we will call her Kelly.  Before this summer she was a rockstar, great energy, super nice, a great worker, with promotion into management potential.
Over the summer, Kelly went to lots of shows, camping with friends and even though I never saw it, she definitely did recreational drugs, and in our line of work, as long as they have the time off, our employees can do what they want on their own time.
The problem is, it's now the end of the summer and she is different.  Shes not on drugs, that would be an easy, immediate termination. But her thought process is different, shes paranoid, she gets nervous that we are secretly ""testing her"", which we are not. Then she broke down crying at work and mentioned something about the government watching and that led me here.
I feel like contacting her emergency contact, her mother, but I dont even know if that's legal.
I AM NOT a medical professional.  That being said, I've never known someone who's become mentally unstable, but it 100% feels like that is what is happening.  I'm curious for how others have dealt with this. I know from a business standpoint I should have already fired her, but I dont want to make her situation worse.  
She clearly does not see the severity of her changes, which is frightening in itself.  Any helpful information would be appreciated.",10Sep2018,2
116,"Hey guys, I’m really worried/stressed out, primarily with how my girlfriend behaves.

I’m not entirely sure where to begin. She was diagnosed with Type II Bipolar at 17 (she is 20 now) but I really believe she was misdiagnosed.

Her psychiatrist at the time believed she had some sort of personality disorder but because she was underage she couldn’t be diagnosed. She stopped seeing her after 2 months and hasn’t received help ever since.

My girlfriend is very obsessive. While i love her and the attention she does give me, I know its not normal and she doesnt handle anything well when i dont pay attention to her (mainly if I am at work or studying for classes). 

Her emotions are very extreme. 3 years earlier when we got together, she told me every time we fought she was convinced I’d abandon her and would have uncontrollable thoughts of suicide. She’s very impulsive like this. The smallest things send her in so deep she is left depressed for days.

I can’t stress enough how bad her abandonment issues are. I’m not going to say her history but she has suffered some serious trauma and abandonment is definitely on the list. It just seems it has taken hold of her and made her become a possessive person.

Before I was in the picture, she had a best friend she was very obsessed with. To the point that she didn’t want her talking to others she didn’t approve of because she felt threatened they’d steal her best friend away and she’d be alone.

She has no issue talking about kpop boys or whatever, but if i even mention a female actress’s name her jealousy skyrockets and she’d be pissed until i say every little thing i love about her.

If u ask, her self esteem is bad. She starved herself, took tons of laxatives to lose weight, force thrown up, etc. While she has improved in her eating, she thinks she is always fat.

She also has this idealized image of a perfect girlfriend she tries to live up to. I love her for who she is, despite her crazier tendencies, and I always tell her I just want her as she is and nothing else.

When we first met she was immediately obsessed with me. I fell for her months later.

She is a beautiful woman and she does purely love me, but i just think her behavior over the years is becoming more dependent and worrisome? Please tell me if I am overreacting or I am worried for a reason.

Is this Bipolar behavior? I believe she has something else entirely.

Can you tell me ways to convince her to look for help because I know she wants a healthier life and I want that for her as well.

What are some illnesses that come to mind about her? If she agrees I want to tell her what seems possible so she could bring it up to whoever she seeks for help. 

Ive been thinking Borderline Personality but I know vaguely anything about mental illnesses and I’m not a psychologist.

Regardless, I just worry for her.

Her mother is also very anti-psychology because my gf’s psychiatrist said a lot of her issues has to do with her mom.

If my gf does agree on seeking help, how can she go about it safely?


Thank u guys in advance.

Even if this is just bipolar disorder, she has spent only 2 months of getting help in the past and over a decade of just mentally deteriorating like this. I love her and I just want her to get better",10Sep2018,6
117,"So. To give some backstory. I got in a relationship while depressed, this later turned abusive from her side however throughout the relationship I became dependant on her throughout the day. Now I'm 9 months later post breakup and still reaching out to anyone I can for that kind of daily attention I had. I need help. ",10Sep2018,1
