0,"I’m in serious need of help. 
As of late I feel like everything in reality doesn’t make sense to me. My brain is overthinking every little detail. 
Example: I understand how water is literally the fundamental of life but WHY is it? Why is it we were created to utilize water? Getting a bit philosophical but it even goes to why do the things I feel, feel that way. I understand because the texture is different but I feel like my brain is over analyzing it and it seriously drives me mad.
It’s really overwhelming. Is there anyone that has gone through this or has advice?",10Mar2018,1
1,I’m a 22f and I’m in serious need of treatment and/or therapy. I haven’t felt like myself in over 2 years and the bad thoughts just keep getting worse and more in depth.. I often especially lately want to check in to a facility but I can’t because I can’t lose my job and I just moved into my new apt. Things like this are what make the bad thoughts get deeper. What options do I have?!,10Mar2018,1
4,"Basically i suffer from anxiety and depression, but i also have this weird disconnection from myself. Like it’s kinda like i have no real personality and that everything i do is fake. I’ve been told repeatedly that i have one of the strongest personalities of anyone, but it all just feels fake to me. This often comes along with negative thoughts of myself as well as being disassociated with myself. I try to avoid mirrors because i feel like shit every time i look in one. I feel in a way disconnected and disassociated from “me.” Every action i do feels completely fake and non genuine and it is eating me up inside. Does anyone have any idea what this is or if it is normal? ",10Mar2018,1
5,"So my girlfriend cried for weeks when her pet fish died, but when someone was murdered in front of her she said she felt nothing. She also says she's had thoughts of murdering people (bad people). Just thoughts tho she doesn't act on them. 

She was abused as a child by her parents and other family members so could that be why she feels nothing for people but cares very much about her pets?

Also what condition/diagnosis could she have? Please tell me anything I should know or that could help.

Thank you.",10Mar2018,1
6,"Hello, I had a question about choosing your therapist.

I am trying to change therapists. My previous therapist had recommended the change due to a lack of progress during my time with her and the cost. 

I have only seen my new therapist twice so far. For the most part, I like her and find her easy to talk to. I haven't really learned much about her style of therapy since the first two meetings had more of an introduction feel.

There was one aspect that puts me off a bit. She has a list of words and phrases that she says you should avoid saying. Words like can't, should, shouldn’t, but, I don’t remember. I don’t remember the whole list, but it was probably 10 items long.

I can understand the basis for this idea, how it can help to change your thought patterns if you use some of the words or phrases to guilt yourself. I could even understand using something similar for myself, finding words and phrases that have a negative impact on me and working to change how I think.

I suppose that I feel like having a generic list like that makes it harder to communicate when I already have trouble identifying my feelings. Not saying that I feel like I should do something doesn’t change the fact that I feel that. But, there also may be more to the technique than I know. I don’t want to balk at it due to discomfort. I know that good therapy isn’t always easy and comfortable. 

Does anyone have experience with this approach to therapy? Does this look like it might be a bad therapist-patient match, or should I try it and see how it works? Is there more to the technique than I am aware of?

Thanks for any advice!",10Mar2018,2
8,"Lately I’ve been assigning feelings to inanimate objects and virtual things. Things with our faces. It’s not conscious, but it’s real. 

Example: I’ve been playing Wordscapes a lot lately, and annoyingly - the words to come have feelings. Like “this word is scared to come in” then “this next word here is angry” and “this one wants to be found” 

There is more, like my pencils are unhappy, or my pillow is sad. 

It’s aggravating, and I can’t shake these notions. What gives? Am I going insane? 

...Edit...

I also, when I’m falling asleep can hear definite voices in my head. Fleeting voices. Very random, quick phrases that zoom across my brain and disappear. It’s almost always the opposite gender which is how I’m sure they’re voices and not thoughts. They are not controllable.

11,"Well.. I’m not so sure to what the deal is with my brain but it has been a mess since I’ve been by myself at my dads house. I’m used to barely feel a thing. Many emotions stripped away, wondering if I exist. (You know the feeling you get when you wonder why you exist, how small we are, what else is out there etc? Like that, but constant) Been like that for the last five years. I know when I feel frustrated, when I enjoy chocolate or stuff like that but it’s sort of... empty? Even if I’m sad it’s hollow. If I have anxiety my body reacts but it’s still.. hollow... it’s weird to explain. What I’ve also had for five years are hallucinations, mostly either incoherent or they don’t make any sense. They rarely appear, but they do so when I’m stressed as fuck or if I have anxiety. If it’s really bad i have a creature following me around and to keep it at bay I either draw symbols or do some other weird shit. I can remember those moments vaguely, like looking through a fog. The only time a can keep this shit from happening is when I’m with people. My brain is occupied with other shit. I basically have to be calm, composed and problem-free since everyone around me expects that from me. 

Recently I started to feel shit again, I’ve been more irritated, frustrated and anxious than I’ve been for years. Sometimes I hear incoherent speech when no one is talking. I’ve asked my mother a couple of times but she didn’t say a thing. I’ve been feeling so depressed and I’ve had more and more suicidal thought so I sought a psychologist, but I haven’t been able to see that person yet. 
But now, when I don’t have to act like the happiest, most composed, mentally healthy little shit I go downhill - and fast. I’ve made a plan on how to take my life, I’ve had a blackout and came to when I almost stabbed myself in the leg with a knife, I’ve hallucinated at work, I have no energy and either I sleep too much or I wake up early as fuck. I’ve had awful nightmares. I’ve realised that I can’t be by myself at night. I have to have someone around me so I can be able to shove all of my problems aside in order to function relatively normal. 

I used to be in therapy, but it kinda abruptly ended. What I did get from that was a diagnose, which was ptsd (a wierd presentation as far as I know). I’ve been bullied, so it stems from then and when I had social phobia. 

I’m trying really hard to find more than one reason to live. It was my mother and my dog. Now? I’m wavering since she took in a refugee and started dating. I feel left out and that she doesn’t need me. My dog? Mom can handle the dog. 

I’m afraid that I’ll try something before my appointment. Please tell me reasons to be alive. ",10Mar2018,0
12,"I've suffered from anxiety, depression and learning disorders ever since I can remember. My anxiety is mostly under control compared to how it used to be, and my depression has also lessened some. My main problem as of recently has been my lack of ability to process simple things. Someone will say something to me, and it will come out as a totally different sentence in my head. It takes me a really long time to understand what someone has said to me, especially if they're telling me or showing me how to do something. I usually have to ask people to repeat themselves to me at least three times before actually understanding what they said. I'm also fairly positive I have dyscalculia (severe diffulty understanding mathematics) as I have never understood even the most basic type of math. I was always told by every teacher I've ever had that i have an attitude and need to cooperate and try harder. What they fail to realize is that I cannot comprehend what they are trying to teach me, no matter how many different ways it is taught. All of my teachers told me to stop faking disorders to get out of doing schoolwork. Already struggling from extreme anxiety at the time, I dropped out of school when i was 16. I hardly ever attended any school I went to, and was almost put in juvenile hall several times for not attending, as missing school is illegal in California until a certain age. I attempted adult ed a couple times and also filled out my GED until it came to the math section, resulting in me having a panic attack and quitting the test. Multiple people have told me I'm stupid because of my lack of education. It is extremely debilitating to not be able to get a job because I can't understand what is said to me and instantly forget instructions as soon as they are given to me. I also cannot cook, because I have to look at the recipe every 10 seconds because I can't remember more than a few words out of a sentence at a time. I've literally spent 15 minutes trying to process instructions for a microwave burrito that cooks in under 2 minutes. I've been told that math is one of the simplest concepts and that all it is is basic common sense. I've been told It's not possible to be smart if I can't understand math. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has similar problems and what they do to help cope....",10Mar2018,1

14,"I'll try to keep this as short and to the point as possible- During the final semester at my community college, my father lost an immense amount of money in the stock market, which prompted my sick mother (breast cancer) to divorce him and move out, leaving me alone in the house with my father. He then attempted suicide three times, all of which I was the one who found him (he somehow kept manipulating his mother and sister to release him from the hospital). 

After his second attempt, I started having intense anxiety attacks and auditory hallucinations- to the point that I sometimes would end up balled up on the floor hyperventilating. The last attempt finally served as a wakeup call to his mother and sister, and they agreed to take care of him. Then I moved across the country (CA) to live with my boyfriend (met him online) and finish my degree. 

I never attended counseling for anything, I just kinda focused on school and my career. My father did better for a while, but unfortunately did end up passing away during my second semester, right after I visited for Christmas. 

I've been fine mentally for the most part, but whenever I became stressed (usually around finals week) I would have flashbacks to some of the events, but if I just went for a walk I would be fine. Fast forward to now, I'm graduating in June, I work part time at a great company, and I have a full time offer lined up. However, yesterday I got into a small car accident (distracted driver hit me), and all of the anxiety and memories have come back, and it's also weird because I keep going from feeling fine, being super productive, to just feeling useless and not being able to get out of bed and replaying all of the times I found my father in my head.",10Mar2018,1

21,"i’m just really desperate for advice and we live on the east coast of america.
so my boyfriend lives with his mom and his grandparents. his mom is severely, severely schizophrenic. 
over the years she has had violent outbreaks, trying to stab multiple family members, tried to run away, almost killed herself on accident many times, puts herself into severe debt. she’s caused severe trauma to my boyfriend so i’m really biased. after these incidents she goes to the mental hospital for a while and comes home with a new prescription. 
now, when she takes her medication, she is stable enough. however, over the past couple months now she’s stopped taking her antipsychotics, so she’s been getting progressively worse psychotic. she told my boyfriend, (her son) but lies to her parents and doctor and says she’s taking them. he’s tried to tell his grandparents but they say they can’t do anything about it.
she spends all day every day running around the house on the verge of tears yelling at her hallucinations and delusions, as well as running in and out of my boyfriends room demanding ridiculous things over and over and over and over. she tells him completely inappropriate things, like childhood sexual abuse stories, that just make me want to cry when she blurts it out to him. it’s awful for him. 
she hasn’t been a direct danger to herself or anyone else physically recently, so his grandparents won’t try to get her involuntarily admitted. but there has to be some kind of rule for this right? she’s allowed to just legally traumatize him worse day after day??

22,"First off, I want to say that over the years, I have been diagnosed with Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, ADD, Depression, Anxiety, and Asperger's Syndrome (However I think the diagnosis with Asperger's was misdiagnosed). My therapist has also said to me that she is suspicious that I have PTSD. Ever since I was child growing up, I have always felt that there has been something wrong with me. I would observe other people my age (and still do to this day) and see how their behavior, freedom, and appearance would be different than mine. I always felt like the person that would finish last. For example, a good chunk of people my age have moved out, got married, have jobs, and so on while I still live with my parents, haven't got my degree yet, can't hold a job (I am 23), still rely on my parents driving me places and can’t be left alone from my parents in public. Growing up, I would feel very hypersensitive with all my 5 senses. For example, some people can't feel an ant crawling on their skin while with me, I can feel every tiny little leg perform movement on my skin. I also remember growing up that I would have extreme anger, anxiety, and depression. I remember how if a Lego piece didn't fit on the model that I was building, that toy would turn into missile flying across the room and explode into a million Lego pieces. I also remember that I would start crying from things that most children wouldn't find upsetting such as sad sounding music. I also remember that I would have severe panic attacks at just the thought of any sort of life threatening health condition that might occur (and still do to this day). I have also had a few head injuries growing up from running out of the bath tub at age 2 and slipping, having a shelf one time fall on top of my head, and running under playground equipment while not ducking down enough resulting in splitting my head. Surprisingly none of the doctors think none of the injuries have caused any set backs but of course I have never received an MRI brain scan to confirm their conclusions. My parents believe the reason I feel so shitty is because of the vaccines I received when I was younger. I'm not sure if that is the case but I feel that there is a possibility. I have also had a lot of traumatic experiences growing up from medical emergencies with me to bullying. Before my life really turned into a hell hole, It was the beginning of 2011 and I actually felt my life was going in the right direction. I had a super cute girlfriend, I was learning to drive, and had lots of great friends. I practically felt almost invincible. However, I did have the occasional panic attack which I attribute to both consuming a lot of caffeine back then and past trauma. I would sometimes have a coffee and a large water glass full of Dr. Pepper sometimes in the same day. I remember occasionally I would feel super tense but I thought it was normal. After all I was told when you are a teenager, you body changes and sometimes you might feel funny. I remember around February or March in 2011, that was when my life took a big hit. I remember had 3 really severe panic attacks on 3 different days. Once at home, at a Wal-Mart, and at my high school's basketball game. I remember after those 3 days I can say that was when I really began to have severe agoraphobia. I felt like I became afraid of everything. Being taxis, trains, elevators, big stores, being surrounded by crowds, etc. It also got so bad that the summer of 2011, I spent it inside of my home because I was so terrified to leave because every time I went out, I would get a really bad panic attack. Since then, I have received adjustments in medication, cognitive behavioral therapy and so on. I also got on and off episodes of really severe depersonalization. I had depersonalization sometimes growing up but back in 2011, I had it almost everyday. Due to how bad my agoraphobia was in 2011, I had to give up driving and wouldn't get my license until the end of 2014 (at age 20). Even though I now have my license, I terrified to even drive outside of my neighborhood and feel that my mind is too impulsive to drive safely. In 2012, I actually developed heart palpitations from the constant anxiety that I would have everyday. Thankfully my doctors said nothing was wrong, told me to take magnesium supplements, and the palpitations went away. I graduated high school in 2013 and started college but never finished. I dropped out of college in March 2015 (but went back in August 2016). I only took classes online because I was so terrified being on campus. Back then and now in college I would barely make C’s. I would try every thing from tutoring to Youtube videos to help me understand my classes and nothing worked. The only reason I haven’t ended up on academic probation is that I cheated every single class I took so I could pass. Some classes I can’t even take (such as pre algebra) because there aren’t any good websites online to help me cheat. Unfortunately I wouldn't get my first job until the end of 2015. Surprisingly after I got my first job, my anxiety started show some improvement. I was able to drive from home to my job (my job was a 3 minute drive) and I was able to be left alone places without my parents being close by. However in the beginning of 2016, I had a really severe panic attack on night driving home and almost got into a car crash at night (the person’s bumper was only 2 inches away from my passenger door!). Shortly after, someone got really sick at my job and the paramedics came while  my verbally abusive store manager and a customer were both yelling at me for not working well during an excessively long line. Combined with the anxiety from the store manager, line, customer, and the paramedics (since I’m terrified of paramedics) I had a really severe panic attack. After that, I would have a panic attack everyday at my job and was scared every time I was behind the wheel. It got so bad, my mom would have to sit outside of my job the whole time until my shifts were over and she would have to drive me everywhere again. My psychiatrist gave propranolol and unfortunately did not make even the slightest difference with my anxiety. My heart palpitations came back and I developed really bad indegestion. It got so bad, I skipped meals because every time I ate, my symptoms got worse. I also couldn’t speak because my stomach would hurt so much. I also got constipation everyday. My parents told me I had to go to the doctor. because it was so bad. My doctor pretty much said it was due to work related stress and gave me famotidine. After a few days of taking the medication and not working, my symptoms went away. Once I went back to my job, all my symptoms came back in an instant. It was like I never took the medication! I remember one day, I had such a bad panic attack at my job, I felt some sort of rush shoot up my spine and then my heart felt funny, got tunnel vision and felt like I turned into the Incredible Hulk and Sonic The Hedgehog at the same time! It was scary! The final blow that made me quit my job was one day, I had such bad anxiety, my throat felt like it closed up for 5- 10 seconds. I couldn’t speak, or breath and my mouth would only let me make awkward movements. After I quit, my mom said to me how she was worried if I would be able to ever hold a job again. Once I quit in April 2017, my life since then and now felt like it has been during 2013 (after finishing high school) and 2014. Everyday I sit home by myself all day while my parents work. Every day feels the same. I only go for walks in the neighborhood when my parents are away when I leave the house since I too scared too leave the neighborhood without my parents. Thankfully I can go to stores and different places but my parents coming with me is a requirement. Now in 2018, I can say that my agoraphobia isn't as bad as it was 7 years ago. However, I feel that there is very little hope for me being able to live a normal life. I feel like someone with low functioning autism (not literally). They grow up having all these problems but when they're older (after receiving the right help of course) they have improved but will never be able take care for themselves, have a family, hold a job and so on. I had cognitive behavioral therapy from September 2011 to December 2013. I have stopped because it was making little to no change with my anxiety. I started take Somatic Experiencing therapy in January 2014 and still take it today and have also started Feldin Krais in October of 2014. All the different therapies treatments I have helped me to some degree but haven’t made any life impacting differences. All lot of people say that my biggest problem is that I have too many negative thoughts. Even though I do agree my thoughts are mostly negative. My issue goes much further than just thoughts. Everyone has negative thoughts at once everyday (at least that’s what I assume) and don’t go into really severe panic attacks out in public. My biggest issue in my opinion, is my body and mind’s sensitivity. I honestly don’t know how long I can continue living like this. I am getting older everyday while I’m watching everyone else my age pass me by in life while I just suffer with the same problems everyday. I feel like I have tried everything and nothing has worked. I really wish I could commit suicide but I’m also too scared to do that too. Every time I hear when a friend of mine moves out, gets engaged, etc. I just start to cry so much because I feel so far behind in life and feel like a gigantic loser. I’ve probably cried at least 2 times writing this. When friends want to do stuff with me, I always either invite them to my house or when they invite me some place, I make up an excuse not to go since I don’t want them to see my parents following me. I also haven't had a girlfriend for 7 years either. I also feel so intimidated around other girls now because I don't know how to get a girlfriend, what to say to them and I've been rejected a lot more times in life than have been accepted. I honestly believe that if someone were in my shoes, they would have committed suicide a long time ago. I don't know what needs to be done, but I can't continue to live life like this. My life it isn't a gift. It's a curse.",10Mar2018,1
23,"I'm a 22 year old male.  I have high aspirations in life that I've had as early as age 7.  I can confidently say that I'm not bad looking, slim, well dressed, well groomed, etc.  However everything else is a shit show.  I'll admit I've learned a bit.  I've grown.  I've expanded my mind enough and am pretty self aware.  But holy shit am I stuck in a vicious and snowballed cycle of self sabotage, self loathing, paranoia, obsessive behavior, and worst of all, procrastination.  Right now I'm only diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I'm pretty sure that ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, and some mild OCD might be in there as well.  

If any of you are curious, I aspire to be a filmmaker.  I have lots of equipment that I worked for and bought myself.  However, any great opportunity that's ever come my way was shit down the toilet by me.  The things I have completed, while some of them are good in my eyes, are complete and 100% rush jobs.  Rush jobs in the fact that about 90% of my edit was done in less than 72 hours after sitting on the footage for sometimes a month on end.  I've also pissed off or disappointed most of the people who really wanted to see me do well and we're ready to give me some great opportunities by sheer laziness, poor communication, and general disregard for the importance of work on my end.  WTF!?  

Add to that my wonderful habit of starting something and not finishing it.  Scripts, trying to work out, eat healthy, meditate, promises I make, and even continuing to go to the F'ing therapist.   I slide really bad then stay there.  I've been this way all of my life especially once I hit puberty. 

And don't get me started on my social life.  That's fucked 100%.  I'm not even hard to get a long with at first.  Hell the last social event I went to I could confidently say I handled myself well at.  Despite all of that I barely talk to my loving family, barely talk to friends (much of whom don't even talk to me anymore).  When I do hang out with people, I'm uninteresting and if I do talk about something it's usually just something I've brought up SEVERAL times in the past.  I'm so bad at texting people back.  I've also been single all of my life, despite most of the girls that I liked in school had an interest in me at least.  Though I never made any of those work.  None of them.  It's pathetic.  

Sorry for the essay I just need to vent.  I can say for the most part I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but usually this vicious cycle ends up in a deep depression that has almost ended up in suicide quite a few times and I feel like I'm headed back that way.  I'm honestly not sure what to do with myself.  I'm stuck and it's only a matter of time before my luck runs out and I fuck up really bad.

Okay I didn't actually suffocate him literally, just figuratively. 

Tonight I lost my SO of a little over a year, someone I was convinced was thee one. It was ugly and my fault.

I was too insecure on top of having severe depression and anxiety. My ex didn't know how to handle it when I'd have an episode of feeling like my world was collapsing... Which triggered a fear that he didn't love me enough b/C he wouldn't research how to comfort me when I'd feel like this... I just felt entitled to that reassurance. 

I was also convinced that no matter what, I wouldn't be good enough and he was going to cheat on me. That was the biggest problem and the cause of our unhealthy relationship. A huge part of me knew that he wouldn't and trusted him. But the huge anxiety part that had already taken over all other aspects of my life, and now took over my trust in him, too.

There were so many red flags that I chose to ignore because of the dependency I'd developed with him (the biggest red flag of all). Recently, I'd start a fight every day that stemmed from my insecurity and my anxiety causing me to be unable to let things go. I would never stop calling him when I'd have an anxiety attack. 

Tonight, he'd had enough of my attitude and consistent snooping of his phone and he decided it was over. I don't blame him. I basically suffocated him. I pushed him to his limit. His limit was my limit, too. 

Tonight left a hole in my heart shaped like him. But the pain of this heartbreak is only motivation for me to never feel like this ever again. Witnessing myself transform into such an unhealthy and self-deprecating person is probably the most painful thing of all, though. Tonight I not only lost him, but I'm now acknowledging that I lost myself throughout our relationship. 

Prior to us breaking up, I'd already begun to see a counselor and I'm determined to continue our sessions this time. I know this is going to be such a long and difficult journey, but it's going to be so worth it at the end. ",10Mar2018,2
33,"I have contemplated throwing this up for a while, will try to keep it as short as I can and spare certain details for the sake of length.

I'm not sure where to start exactly. I believe her to be extremely depressed and she has struggled with it most of her life. She was sexually abused within her family as a child, abused by her father, lived on her own her senior year of high school, etc. Both of her parents are alcoholics and her mother attempted suicide 6 years ago. When I met her she mentioned some of this and being in therapy, but I didn't quite connect that she was severely depressed until right as we break up...

Meet roughly 1 year ago via Twitter and hang out shortly after. Things escalate and she informs me that she lives with her ex. This was my first potential LTR, so while I knew this to be dangerous, I didn't overthink it too much or consider the ultimate repercussions. Agree to relationship in June and things are super easy all Summer. September comes and she's now enrolled in two schools, including three physical classes and four online. This is the time my feelings truly begin to escalate and everything sort of gets difficult. She becomes slightly vague, a little flaky at times, but communication remains consistent and everything is reciprocated. October goes well, although it seems something is up at this point. In November, she goes back to work at a place she hates and had worked the previous four years. She fails one of her courses, has multiple blowups at work, and then an incident at Thanksgiving with her family that leads to self harming. We break up two weeks later.

When we broke up, she claimed she wanted to be on her own (Has never been single) and wants to find her own happiness. Honestly, once I realized what was happening, I think this was the absolutely right thing for her and still do. In the proceeding weeks, she was open to everything. Being physical, having sex, although weary of ""Leading me on"" and acknowledged that multiple times. Very emphathetic the whole way. I was there for her, every step, especially entering the new year. Talking on the phone for hours, lots of texting dialogue and in some ways I was having deeper feelings at this point as I now understood better what was happening. It was difficult for her to even face anything in the real world. Crying for hours and had no idea why. The idea of being physical slowly diminishes over the proceeding days/weeks. “It’s complicated”, but she still has never outright said no to sex.

Now lets enter the ex factor. They were becoming more platonic over time, but I had no reason to believe much was happening, and when I did address her about it, she reassured me and said all the right things. We lived on opposite sides of the city, so distance was an issue at times, and especially in November, he, who has already seen and dealt with her shit, was able to be there for her. He was there when we broke up, and he was there on a long time planned trip at the beginning of the year with mutual friends. He has a close dynamic with her family as well and she has told me that she feels pressure from them about him. Also in the last two meetings she has subtly noted she’s leaning on him numerous times.

Her and the ex moved back home at the beginning of the year.

So I see her for the first time in late January and we have sex. The next week is the first hint of her having feelings for the ex, which she has recently admitted started right before and around the time we broke up. She was and remains somewhat cagey about him, never really wanted to tell me that they were back together and still hasn't, although social media has made it obvious and it has been acknowledge between us. He knows I exist. Really, it just seems like she was confused and unsure, right? Consistent with what she's struggling with. The first week of February, we spend roughly 40-45 hours together over an eight day period doing assorted things, which is probably more than we ever hung out in a week when together. We have sex again in early February. At this point, it is clear her and the ex are back together or it is very imminent.

This is where stuff gets particularly stupid/weird. We go to a show about a month ago and she shows up drunk and loses her debit card/id, and leaves. The ex comes to pick her up and takes her home in the middle of the show. The next day, I get the ""You don't deserve someone like me in your life... It felt like my life was spiraling out of control... I'm an alcoholic, I know I am"" talk. I talk her down and everything is ok. This is the only time I slightly began to resent her and said a few stupid things that I do regret. At this point she is obviously back with him, it's weird, and we agree on space a few days later. Four days in, she asks to pay for the ticket to the show she left. She claims she will have the money soon and I tell her to let me know. A few days later she says she has it and wants to meet up, I go nc for 1-2 days and tell her we can meet up soon. On her Birthday, a few days later, she reaches out to me and asks if we are still meeting up, at 9 PM and clearly drunk. We meet up last week and she is in super blunt, bitch mode. I should have noted she started an anti depressant sometime in early February. ""I resent you... It took me a year to realize I don't like that person, etc"". Saying a lot of mean things at a pace that I could barely keep up with. At this point, I'm going to stick it out and see what happens, but don't initiate anything. She initiates texting and snaps me over the proceeding days. On Saturday night, she knew I was going to a party and at 11 PM reaches out to ask me how my night was going. Fast forward to Monday, she has been day drinking and reaches out to me. Wanted to grab a drink and then come back to my place. She was drunk enough a few hours later that she couldn't drive and asked me to pick her up. I said no. A few hours later, she says she slept and showered and could hang out, but I was doing something else and told her I would be back later that night. ""Should I just come over?"" It didn't work out. We met up a few days ago and she continues the mean streak. Now finding very small things from our relationship and making it a general narrative, such as me being negative and demanding. Meanwhile, she always told me we had a mature, positive, and happy relationship. Since we split, I moved to the city, I got a steady 9-5 (I had a great online gig previously that I still do on the side), and joined a sports team, amongst other things, and this has clearly been on her mind as she brought it up as well, but it felt more in a negative way than something positive. I don't recall the exact context.

She is extremely erratic day to day. One day she is going to AA, the next she can control it. She got a new job... The first day, she broke down walking in and went home. The second day she loved it, the third day she hated it and doesn't know if she is going back.

So, what are we dealing with here? She is severely troubled, right? BPD, depression? Is it a self esteem thing, does she still have feelings for me, am I a side guy (And potentially asked too many questions)? Is she trying to push me away? And if she is, why does she keep initiating despite being mean as fuck when we meet up?

If anyone read this mess, thank you.

TL;DR Lives with ex, things going well, life implodes, proceeding months are weird and she's back with the ex, but still in constant contact with me despite trying to push me away and being mean.",10Mar2018,1
34,"School just crushed me. I just can't bear it. I already knew I was gonna hate it when I decided to go to school for four more years. But I really wanted to go to uni and that was the only way I could. I thought that I could just do the bare minimum and shrug it off. Goddamn I was wrong. I've turned into a shadow of myself. My anxiety got worse, I'm depressed and all the dreams and I had for my life I don't care about anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I don't enjoy the things I used to love, and I didn't find any new ones. I used to read 5 books a week for years, nowadays I don't even have enough motivation to read a short article. Even listening to music isn't special anymore unless I'm high or drunk. The worst part is that I feel like I have already slept on all the chances I had in my life. I know that's not true, but my perfectionistic brain doesn't wanna accept that. God forbid I live a happy life. Somehow my brain has always been routed to think that that's not possible anyways. I mean what's the point of living if you aren't the one who saves the world amirite? 

I went to a meditation retreat for three days a few months ago. Lately, whenever I get these kinds of thoughts about my future, I get this idea that I should become some sort of monk, because I felt calm inside for the first time when I went to that retreat. Now I'm conflicted with these two very different things I want from life and it just leaves me paralyzed. I frequently disassociate (if that's the right word) my whole sight goes blurry, everything gets silent, and I'm somewhere fucking else. When I snap out of it it feels like I just stopped running for a few seconds. I can never remember feeling or thinking anything during those moments. But there are moments where I get super angry and filled with hate so fast. I am always able to control myself because I've always had a lot of self-control, but I am frightened as to what would happen if I don't have the mental strength to calm myself down one day.

All of this has caused me to do almost nothing for school during the last two years, and I still managed to get through fairly easily, but it's all catching up to me now. My finals are going to be soon and I don't even have the motivation to do the regular school stuff let alone study for my finals.

I've tried getting a therapist but all those which are covered by insurance are booked up and we can't afford to pay ourselves. 

I have no idea as to how I will be able to life a good life like this, and I don't know how I can ever get my zest for life.",10Mar2018,1
35,"I'm very much an outsider to this subreddit but I see you do give advice here. I dont have any mental health condition, (am scoring very low in various depression/anxiety inventories), however in the last few weeks I seem to be compulsively staying in bed pretty much all day. 

As soon as I get home even if I tell myself not to I just end up lying in bed all day and once there, have very little volition to leave. I'm currently blaming being bored in my house/having nothing to do, but then doesn't explain why its so hard to leave my bed surely? It makes me very annoyed at myself. While there all I do is watch videos and some days nap for a few hours.

The only reason I'm keen to stress my regular mental health is becauses it really is like a stand-alone symptom I'm having: I've not lost interest in other activities, regularly exercise, have high hopes for my future etc, but just can't leave my bed. I was hoping people on here might better have ideas as to what the source of this compulsion to lie in bed is, given I seriously doubt its depression?",10Mar2018,2

38,"So basically for 7 months now I am suffering from hopefully Suicide-OCD, I was diagnosed with OCD 2 times, and 1 time the doctor said it might be adjustment disorder but it does not describe my symptoms well.

So basically, it all started after reading about Chester Bennington's suicide, about 7 months ago, then I started having intrusive thoughts about it, then I googled it, started reading about depression, then I had a major panic attack, to the point of vomitting.(Yes, I know this is a typical trigger for OCD and this is how it usually starts, I had OCD episode 5 years ago, but can't remember exactly if it was the same.) Anyway, here is what happens.

**My symptoms are:**

- Knot in the stomach when it is bad, always.

- Butterflies like in the stomach when I am good.

- Obsessive thinking.(Don't know if it is obsesssive though, It is like I get intrusive thought or feeling, then I the knot in the stomach appear and I start thinking about possible diagnoses etc. And the thought keeps feeling real. I am irritable in those moments. (I know it sounds like OCD, so far, but **don't jump to conclusions yet.**)

'Life is meaningless' feeling. It is not like the depression feeling. More like the existential way, but still doesn't feel existential. It feels kind of synthetic. It is based on few things:

- Thoughts like 'What is the point of working when I will die one day?' Etc.

- Dark high contrast, low brightness pics of my future, not consious, like stuck in the back of my head, can't see them clearly, they are random, for example at the moment it is like me standing at the bus stop in my university, the image is drone like. And other weird stuff.

- It is usually triggered when I imagine doing something nice or just living a normal life, like a lost feeling? I don't know how to describe it.

- It is like in the end of life nothing happens.(I know it is irrational it is fucking weird and always accompanied with anxiety.

- Like a flat life feeling. Again, not emptiness like depression.

- It is strongly connected to working.
Other symptoms include:

**Other symptoms:*

- Irritability when it is bad.

- Sudden feeling of trapped in life, like I want to escape, but there is no escape.

- Sudden feeling like everything I see is too much. Looking at my room for example. Like overload?

- Feeling like if I work in the future I will do it.(For example my mother told me that I can start working at a store and instant images of me working then at the end of working I do it, it is like if i work for a week I will do it. It is terrifying. It comea with a knot in the stomach and mood drop.

- Feeling like if this condition is gone and I continue to live a normal life I will do it. It almost feel like I want these things to be there, but at the same time I am terrified of them, but at the same time I am terrified of them leaving.

- Feeling like a dark cloud is setting over my future and I can't see my usual future because of those pictures and feelings, again ALWAYS accompanied with anxiety.(Again, not quite like the depression thing.)

- In the morning, before I fully woke up I am in this weird half-awake condition when those feelings and thoughts like attack me? But at the same time it feels super real, like me. Then I can't go back to sleep, I stanf up, make coffee and those things usually last about hours, then I get almost to my normal self. However, when it is bad, it is bad all day and I have multiple times through the day when I feel normal for a couple of mins, then it hits again.

- Doubt if I want it or not and extreme confusion over it. It is more like 'I want it but I am pretending not to.', 'I don't want to admit it', 'Don't fully realise it.' And when this is there it feel legit, like I really want it BECAUSE of those feelings, which is horrific. It feels 100% like me.

- I am avoiding asking myself if I want to do it or if I want to die because:
  - When I do it it feels like I do which is making everything worse.
  - Or I say no, but with extreme anxiety and then yes appears and feels 100% like me which is scary.

- Gets worse after an arguing. Hits hard and my anxiety goes up all the way. (I thought It was BPD , but I researched a lot and it does not sound like me.)

It seems to have a cycle:

**When I am feeling okay:**
Bad in the morning.
Then I feel fine, then in the afternoon it hits and my mood drops, then usually at midnight I feel okay.

**When it is bad:**
The whole day is bad and I have minutes when I feel okay, then it hits again.

The most scary thing in this condition are **the urges**.

They almost everytime come without any reason or 
after days of worrying, it induces a panic attack in which everything hits at once.

Urges:

When I am close to dangerous objects.(Power sockets, high buildings, medications, etc. You get it.(I know it sounds like OCD, but still, wait, **don't jump to conclusions yet**.)

Urges are caused by thoughts like:

'Cmon, it will be so easy.'(This one is terrifying.)

'Life is meaningless anyway'

'I want to do it.'

'Why don't just give up.'(And it feels super real like I am about to give up.)

Etc. Etc. Etc. 

I am terrified.

**Background description of the urges:**

So, they happen when I am feeling relatively okay, then I can tell it is probably OCD. HOWEVER, when it is bad or hits bad out of nowhere here is how it feels like:
Like a flat life feeling, with the things, I mentioned before. And the scariest thing is that it feels like 1000% like me and like a decision. 

It is terrifying. I can only tell that it was not me when I am fine, but then, it hits again. 

**The scary thing is that it feels like I have anxiety because I want it and resist it or because I know it is not right**

**The second scary thing is that I can't tell if intrusive suicidal thoughts trigger feelings(good.) Or the feelings trigger real suicidal thoughts.**(**bad.**)

Here is how it happens and what it looks like:

**03.03.2018:**

I am watching a TV show, feeling relatively fine, when I decide to see if the feeling is in background. I suddenly get a thought like 'I can't continue living.' With a very fucking real feeling like I really don't and all of those feelings hit. It feels horrific. I am immediately not sleepy, In highly self aware state, with like racing thoughts(not exactly.) I feel the knot in the stomach, it feels real, I immediately turn off the show on my phone and message a person who has the same thing as me at the moment. I stand up and go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. **IT STILL FEELS SUPER REAL AND 100% LIKE ME** I light my ciggarete and my vision crosses arround the power socket on the wall as soon as I see it thought like 'I want to do it' appear or 'It is pointless' I can't remember the thought exactly it felt super fast. After this a feeling like I want to give up appears like I am about to do it. An urge to look back at the power socket appears. I open reddit and start to write this topic. As I am writing I calm down and it feels less real and turns into 'background' again. As I am writing I have mini hits lasting a few seconds which makes it real again. As I wrote this sentence the same thing happened.


**Panic attacks:**
Basically the same thing, but in more intense way. More intense urges. 
Etc. Etc. I am even not sure if it is a panic attack or something worse.

**After a panic attack I calm down, but the next few days it is so fucking bad.** 

So I have researched a lot about this topic and they are several diagnosis I want to mention and to say few things about them:

I am extremely scared that it is **suicidal depression.** However I looked at the symptoms here is what I get:

- Hopelessness (I am not sure about this, I can't tell if the meaningless thing is hopelessness. And as soon as I mentioned hopelessness I felt like I am feeling hopeless which gives me knot in the stomach.)

- Worthlessness - I don't have it.

- Guilt - I sometimes have it over the thoughts.

- Sadness - I don't have it.

- Emptiness - I don't have it.

- Depressed mood - Can't tell.

- Lost in interest in usual activites. (I can't tell if I get this, I tend to only research or reread articles about this topic when I am feeling bad, and I am not able to do nothing else. I tend to have moments when I don't want to go out because of this knot in the stomach and the other stuff, I 'preffer' to be at home and reading stuff.)

- Tiredness - After a long day when it is bad, yes.

- Oversleeping - I usually sleep about 8 to 9 hours.

- Low self esteem - I don't have it.

- Feeling burden - I don't have it.

- Lost of apetite - When the knot in the stomach is there, yes, like my stomach is sick.

- Suicidal thoughts (As you probably read already, I get this, however, in depression, it is associated with relief, fantasies, and CONSIOUS THINKING.(As I am typing this I feel like it is giving me relief and like I feel consious about it, which makes the condition worse - the knot in the stomach gets worse. 

**Told my psychiatrist and psychologist about it, they said it is not depression** However I am not sure.

My next fear is **Bipolar Affective Disorder Type 2**:

Bipolar is known to cause depression and hypomania.
I looked at the symptoms of mania and hypomania.
I asked most of my friends and family if they seen any of the symptoms(I showed them a list of the symtpoms.) In me and they dismissed it.
I also analysed my mood and actions while I am fine. 

I tend to do the things I usually do, for the same time. 

I don't sleep less. 

I don't talk faster. 

I am not easily distracted.

I don't do reckless stuff. 
And most importantly my mood does not change completely from the bad mood. Also it tends to change during the day. 

**The thing which is worrying me is that I am more irritable than usual.**

Anxiety symptoms which I have:

- Irritability.

- Sweating and BAD sweat smell, worse than usual.(My hands sweat when I am bad, however they were always sweating since I am young so I don't know if it fits there.

- Knot in the stomach.

- Derealisation.(Sometimes.)

- Restlessness.

- Faster highrate.

- Headaches sometimes.

- Unsettledness

I am sure that I missed something. Feel free to ask questions if you have. Thanks in advance and have a good night.

**P.S. I am aware that this is probably reasurance seeking, but however it feels too real to be OCD and in fact I am not sure if I didn't missed something. I know too that the feeling like I didn't described everything is probably OCD, but still.**

41,"I’m constantly counting. It can be the windows of a car, the cracks in the sidewalk, the holes in a laundry basket, the blades on a window’s blinds, the features of person’s face, tiles, lights, cars, mailboxes, door frames, patterns, the corners and points of literally everything. You name it. Most likely, I will have counted the corners and sides or simply the object before. 

I don’t know why I do it, but I feel like I have to or else I won’t be satisfied. When I click a pen, I had to click it 10 times. If I click it more than 10 times, I have to click it 100 times... on each hand to make it even. 

I enjoy even numbers. I like order. I don’t like change. If I touch something a specific amount of times, preferably 10, I’ll have to do it with the other hand. 

Now, I can go without counting or touching things a certain amount of times here and there, but it’s practically constant counting and thinking. I’m a quite person and I think that’s because I’m always obsessing over counting things in my head. 

I like things to land on even numbers as well. I’ve mentioned that, but it’s crucial that it must be even. 

For example, if I spot a simple square shaped painting, I will counts the sides and corners. 8. I’ll count the wall it’s on. 9. It’s uneven, so I’ll count the air around it. 10. Perfect... But now I need to force myself not to think about the actual painting and the hollow space behind it or else I’ll begin counting again and I won’t be satisfied. That’s hard to do. 

I don’t understand why I do this. It’s been something that I’ve done since I was a young child. I remember walking through the living room and “stepping over” the legs of the couch as if when they touched the ground, they casted some sort of laser beam I couldn’t step on. This would happen every time I entered or left the living room. 

I’m not sure if any of you can help me, but if you can, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time. ",10Mar2018,9
42,"Hello everyone.

I have been on medication for my anxiety and depression for almost two months. Even in the past two months I’ve noticed a change. The constant worry and anxiety has almost completely gone away. I’ve lived this way for so long I felt nearly ten times lighter. Those I’ve told about my meds have told me to be careful because some have had negative past experiences but I take this with a grain of salt. They want me to not go down a dark path and I appreciate that.

My family and even my partner has noticed a complete change in my attitude. I’m happier, laughing more, not dwelling on things and I’m definitely enjoying living in the moment. I’ll always be an introvert (people can be exhausting) but I feel like the me that was stuck behind a distorted glass wall for so long is finally breaking free.

Thank you for your support and for those also on this journey, keep fighting for yourself, it’s worth it.",10Mar2018,2
45,"First off, I want to say that over the years, I have been diagnosed with Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, ADD, Depression, Anxiety, and Asperger's Syndrome (However I think the diagnosis with Asperger's was misdiagnosed). My therapist has also said to me that she is suspicious that I have PTSD. Ever since I was child growing up, I have always felt that there has been something wrong with me. I would observe other people my age (and still do to this day) and see how their behavior, freedom, and appearance would be different than mine. I always felt like the person that would finish last. For example, a good chunk of people my age have moved out, got married, have jobs, and so on while I still live with my parents, haven't got my degree yet, can't hold a job (I am 23), still rely on my parents driving me places and can’t be left alone from my parents in public. Growing up, I would feel very hypersensitive with all my 5 senses. For example, some people can't feel an ant crawling on their skin while with me, I can feel every tiny little leg perform movement on my skin. I also remember growing up that I would have extreme anger, anxiety, and depression. I remember how if a Lego piece didn't fit on the model that I was building, that toy would turn into missile flying across the room and explode into a million Lego pieces. I also remember that I would start crying from things that most children wouldn't find upsetting such as sad sounding music. I also remember that I would have severe panic attacks at just the thought of any sort of life threatening health condition that might occur (and still do to this day). I have also had a few head injuries growing up from running out of the bath tub at age 2 and slipping, having a shelf one time fall on top of my head, and running under playground equipment while not ducking down enough resulting in splitting my head. Surprisingly none of the doctors think none of the injuries have caused any set backs but of course I have never received an MRI brain scan to confirm their conclusions. My parents believe the reason I feel so shitty is because of the vaccines I received when I was younger. I'm not sure if that is the case but I feel that there is a possibility. I have also had a lot of traumatic experiences growing up from medical emergencies with me to bullying. Before my life really turned into a hell hole, It was the beginning of 2011 and I actually felt my life was going in the right direction. I had a super cute girlfriend, I was learning to drive, and had lots of great friends. I practically felt almost invincible. However, I did have the occasional panic attack which I attribute to both consuming a lot of caffeine back then and past trauma. I would sometimes have a coffee and a large water glass full of Dr. Pepper sometimes in the same day. I remember occasionally I would feel super tense but I thought it was normal. After all I was told when you are a teenager, you body changes and sometimes you might feel funny. I remember around February or March in 2011, that was when my life took a big hit. I remember had 3 really severe panic attacks on 3 different days. Once at home, at a Wal-Mart, and at my high school's basketball game. I remember after those 3 days I can say that was when I really began to have severe agoraphobia. I felt like I became afraid of everything. Being taxis, trains, elevators, big stores, being surrounded by crowds, etc. It also got so bad that the summer of 2011, I spent it inside of my home because I was so terrified to leave because every time I went out, I would get a really bad panic attack. Since then, I have received adjustments in medication, cognitive behavioral therapy and so on. I also got on and off episodes of really severe depersonalization. I had depersonalization sometimes growing up but back in 2011, I had it almost everyday. Due to how bad my agoraphobia was in 2011, I had to give up driving and wouldn't get my license until the end of 2014 (at age 20). Even though I now have my license, I terrified to even drive outside of my neighborhood and feel that my mind is too impulsive to drive safely. In 2012, I actually developed heart palpitations from the constant anxiety that I would have everyday. Thankfully my doctors said nothing was wrong, told me to take magnesium supplements, and the palpitations went away. I graduated high school in 2013 and started college but never finished. I dropped out of college in March 2015 (but went back in August 2016). I only took classes online because I was so terrified being on campus. Back then and now in college I would barely make C’s. I would try every thing from tutoring to Youtube videos to help me understand my classes and nothing worked. The only reason I haven’t ended up on academic probation is that I cheated every single class I took so I could pass. Some classes I can’t even take (such as pre algebra) because there aren’t any good websites online to help me cheat. Unfortunately I wouldn't get my first job until the end of 2015. Surprisingly after I got my first job, my anxiety started show some improvement. I was able to drive from home to my job (my job was a 3 minute drive) and I was able to be left alone places without my parents being close by. However in the beginning of 2016, I had a really severe panic attack on night driving home and almost got into a car crash at night (the person’s bumper was only 2 inches away from my passenger door!). Shortly after, someone got really sick at my job and the paramedics came while  my verbally abusive store manager and a customer were both yelling at me for not working well during an excessively long line. Combined with the anxiety from the store manager, line, customer, and the paramedics (since I’m terrified of paramedics) I had a really severe panic attack. After that, I would have a panic attack everyday at my job and was scared every time I was behind the wheel. It got so bad, my mom would have to sit outside of my job the whole time until my shifts were over and she would have to drive me everywhere again. My psychiatrist gave propranolol and unfortunately did not make even the slightest difference with my anxiety. My heart palpitations came back and I developed really bad indegestion. It got so bad, I skipped meals because every time I ate, my symptoms got worse. I also couldn’t speak because my stomach would hurt so much. I also got constipation everyday. My parents told me I had to go to the doctor. because it was so bad. My doctor pretty much said it was due to work related stress and gave me famotidine. After a few days of taking the medication and not working, my symptoms went away. Once I went back to my job, all my symptoms came back in an instant. It was like I never took the medication! I remember one day, I had such a bad panic attack at my job, I felt some sort of rush shoot up my spine and then my heart felt funny, got tunnel vision and felt like I turned into the Incredible Hulk and Sonic The Hedgehog at the same time! It was scary! The final blow that made me quit my job was one day, I had such bad anxiety, my throat felt like it closed up for 5- 10 seconds. I couldn’t speak, or breath and my mouth would only let me make awkward movements. After I quit, my mom said to me how she was worried if I would be able to ever hold a job again. Once I quit in April 2017, my life since then and now felt like it has been during 2013 (after finishing high school) and 2014. Everyday I sit home by myself all day while my parents work. Every day feels the same. I only go for walks in the neighborhood when my parents are away when I leave the house since I too scared too leave the neighborhood without my parents. Thankfully I can go to stores and different places but my parents coming with me is a requirement. Now in 2018, I can say that my agoraphobia isn't as bad as it was 7 years ago. However, I feel that there is very little hope for me being able to live a normal life. I feel like someone with low functioning autism (not literally). They grow up having all these problems but when they're older (after receiving the right help of course) they have improved but will never be able take care for themselves, have a family, hold a job and so on. I had cognitive behavioral therapy from September 2011 to December 2013. I have stopped because it was making little to no change with my anxiety. I started take Somatic Experiencing therapy in January 2014 and still take it today and have also started Feldin Krais in October of 2014. All the different therapies treatments I have helped me to some degree but haven’t made any life impacting differences. All lot of people say that my biggest problem is that I have too many negative thoughts. Even though I do agree my thoughts are mostly negative. My issue goes much further than just thoughts. Everyone has negative thoughts at once everyday (at least that’s what I assume) and don’t go into really severe panic attacks out in public. My biggest issue in my opinion, is my body and mind’s sensitivity. I honestly don’t know how long I can continue living like this. I am getting older everyday while I’m watching everyone else my age pass me by in life while I just suffer with the same problems everyday. I feel like I have tried everything and nothing has worked. I really wish I could commit suicide but I’m also too scared to do that too. Every time I hear when a friend of mine moves out, gets engaged, etc. I just start to cry so much because I feel so far behind in life and feel like a gigantic loser. I’ve probably cried at least 2 times writing this. When friends want to do stuff with me, I always either invite them to my house or when they invite me some place, I make up an excuse not to go since I don’t want them to see my parents following me. I also haven't had a girlfriend for 7 years either. I also feel so intimidated around other girls now because I don't know how to get a girlfriend, what to say to them and I've been rejected a lot more times in life than have been accepted. I honestly believe that if someone were in my shoes, they would have committed suicide a long time ago. I don't know what needs to be done, but I can't continue to live life like this. My life it isn't a gift. It's a curse.",10Mar2018,1

47,"I am a 21 year old male from Colorado, I have fallen so so far in the last three years I dont remember how I used to think so well anymore. Long story short I am currently in a residential treatment program that is helping to teach me how to save my own life. I am diagnosed with moderate or severe depression idk... I take meds regularly for it due to lack of concentration and energy. However I am also a drug addict. Before I started my journey into institutional life I had been experimenting regularly with weed. I was in a rather unhealthy relationship at the time and didnt feel very confident in myself as a person coming in to a new environment like college. 

which brings me to my point. I believe I have a long lasting paranoid delusion. in college at the peak of these thoughts I believed people would talk about me when I walked by and that everyone knew who I was and what was going on with me. that was in 2015, to this day I seem to have convinced myself that someone or something is watching me and aware of my actions. 

To many that may seem scary, but I have found that I have been so lonely, at times they comfort me. My strongest rationalization I have created for myself is that it is the dead, angels, spirits, I'm not certain. I am not particularly religious but ever since I was young I have believed in reincarnation which has lead me to believe that these spirits have chosen for one reason or another to stay in the afterlife perhaps as guardians (if im losing you a bit with that one I dont blame you at all). 


I have been tested before for possible psychosis and even drug induced psychosis. My best way of describing it is that I have ""created"" voices in my head but they dont sound any different to me and I dont really have any dialogue with them. Its like they are sometimes there when I do something I think is notable, or funny, or stupid, but its always just comments and I dont give any of it much weight. I think I need to make it clear that these are NOT hallucinations I do not actually ""hear"" anything other than what it might be like for you saying to yourself ""hmmm didnt take out the trash today"" it is very similar to this but I am not really ""hearing"" myself talk im thinking of a group of other entities thoughts and feelings. The rational side of me knows that its not real and whats me to stop thinking like this. the irrational side of me is comfortable with secretly being a bit nutty as it doesn't really interfere with functioning at all in fact it is actually quite helpful in my battle with addiction.

Is there a name for these kind of thoughts/paranoia or is it simply under a mental delusion. If there were a point in my life were I felt like this was a problem could i do anything? (have been put on a heavy dose of zyprexa before, didnt do anything) could this develop into something more serious? any info would be nice and congrats if you made it to the end. ",10Mar2018,1
49,"I'm 16 and recently I feel like I've gone off the rails entirely. Prior to last summer, I was a straight A student, with very good predicted GCSE results. The biggest issue I dealt with at this time, was crippling boredom and OCD style thoughts. I'd worry whether I was a paedophile, or a psychopath. I once had the thought of grabbing a knife and stabbing my younger sister, and it haunted me for a very long time afterwards. I'd wrestle between knowing this was wrong, and knowing I had this thought and wondering where it stemmed from. I also had suicidal thoughts of this same manner. On top of that, I usually felt empty and bored, and I would try to fill this gap by going out, drawing, watching Youtube, but nothing seemed to really ease the problem. I knew that eventually, I'd be back to this boredom. Then last summer I went on holiday to visit family. It was a 6 week holiday, and I was incredibly tired throughout it all, but i made a plan of how to get my life back together and be able to enjoy it once I got back, but that plan never really came to work. The day after I got back, I had an ""existential crisis"", knowing that I now had to face the crippling boredom once more. I eventually decided that the ""meaning of life"" for me is to enjoy it and make people happy and other sentimental things like that, but when it came down to me trying to improve my life in some meaningful manner, nothing worked. I signed up to all sorts of things, in school and out, in an attempt to find ""myself"" and maybe build my character along the way, as I never felt I had much of a personality. This was up until the end of October, and through the whole ordeal I was busy battling more suicidal urges and thoughts; I put it down to OCD and tried not to pay attention to them, effectively squashing them out of my mind. But as soon as that ended, I dissociated for most of November and December, with every waking moment being a battle of me trying to find any form of clarity. My form of clarity came in me simply FORCING myself to do things, literally pushing myself out of my head, but I think that caused another type of dissociation. It was during this time I took my mock exams and I did very well in them, but my memories of that time are blurred. Or are they? I don't know. I stayed in this weird calm, dissociated but ""not me"" state of myself until one day in February. We were learning about global warming in a lesson, and somehow that seemed to have resonated with my subconscious and I felt like myself again. But I didn't like it. I remember sobbing for about an hour, before eventually dissociating again. Since then, I seem to be in a mix of either feeling like ""myself"" at my lowest point and subsequently feeling suicidal and hating life. Though what i find odd is that I don't know whether it's a ""depression"" form of suicidal feelings, because whenever I feel like that I know I'm probably not going to kill myself, and a part of me always manages to drag the rest of myself through these episodes, but I still want to die during them, and tend to ask all my friends for advice, to try and wrench me out from this feeling, though a part of me suspects I ask friends for attention as opposed to actually needing help. 

Right now, I'm 2 days away from more mock exams and have done almost no revision. My GCSEs are a few months away and I have no incentive to revise, or do well. I don't seem to have the will to care anymore, and I don't think I ever did. Everyone expects me to do incredibly well in them, but I have no motivation to. When it comes down to it, I don't feel like I have the incentive to do anything really. Except google my problems and ponder on what's wrong with me. I don't think I've ever had the drive to do much out of pure ""passion"", in my short 16 years, more to either quell my boredom, to have something to do or so if I work at it, i can become ""rich and famous"".  It makes me feel shallow, yet again I don't seem to be able to care. My friends are all pumped for the future, and know what they want to be, what to do, they want to study and do well in their exams, yet me, the one who should be the most hyped up to do so, just doesn't care. I feel like I live in the moment now, but I wish I didn't. I wish I was literally anyone else, any one of my friends, who all have passions and ambitions and want to do well. I don't, and I'm losing track of time. I find that odd, as before I used to have a very strong sense of time. I just tend to do things that I find interesting in the moment, usually figuring out what mental illness I have, before telling myself I shouldn't be googling my symptoms. But I don't know what else to do. Nothing else interests me. My friends are constantly asking me to do things with them, play games, watch movies, yet again, I never get round to it. When I do, there's no feel of enjoyment. It's more of me being aware that I'm doing it simply to pass time. Like I'm scared to live in the moment, because if I do that, everything will come off the rails. I wonder if I've ever felt enjoyment. The only feelings I seem to have nowadays is either total numbness to emotion and solely running on logic, intense sadness (but even that is becoming less intense with time now; I used to cry loads and be very sensitive to criticism but I just don't seem to give a shit anymore most of the time), boredom, a mild form of emptiness, and frustration. At myself? Mildly, but more at other people. Annoyance at everyone for everything. Stop bothering me with your issues, I don't care. Stop asking me if I'm okay, you shouldn't care. Stop thinking I still want to do this; I don't, and I don't see why you should care. I don't usually expect people to care about me, though I do care about others. Or more, I did. Not anymore. I THINK I used to care about others anyway. But now I find myself doubting whether I care for my parents, or my sister, who I've always thought I loved very much. I know that I SHOULD, but again, can't seem to care and I don't seem to care about not caring. Some of these issues I feel I've had all my life and have simply ignored in favour of trying to be ""good"". I remember some incidents in which I was horrible, such as holding my sister by the throat when I was 11, or whacking my mum for constantly correcting me on something when I was maybe 8 or 9. When my parents tell me off or advise me, I always find it more of an annoyance and a waste of time that they're trying to do so, though I know they mean well. A lot of my extended family comprises of wonderful people who are all very caring, yet although I know I SHOULD love them, I don't feel like I do. Like I don't have the capacity to. I feel like I love my sister in the way she's all cute and adorable and forever curious and caring, but not a ""sisterly"" sort of bond. A lot of my actions, good or bad, i have ""no opinion"" to, which seems to ring ""psychopath"" or something to me. I don't know what I feel towards people, and if I feel anything at all. I've played with the idea that maybe I'm a mild psychopath, but it didn't feel ""right"". Didn't feel like it described me. I have quite an entitled attitude too, and always have had. Not a helping one; though nowadays I do try to help people in small ways. My old counsellor said I had a lot of pride, and I agree with that; it stems all the way back to my earliest memories. I know a lot of the people in my life are good and well-meaning and caring, but I seem to find a lot of them ""stupid"" and annoying, though I feel bad for doing so, as I know that judgement is unfair. But it's a very dull, ""quiet"" sort of bad, one that I can shrug off, not encompassing remorse. Furthermore, I've never felt truly ""part"" of something, whether that be family, school or friends, but it's more like an act I need to keep holding up, with the alternative being I slouch in silence and keep to myself, doing nothing productive but looking at memes, judging everyone and occasionally sobbing before ceasing to care. 

That's not to say I haven't felt SOME normal emotions before. I've spent a great deal of time reflecting on my life to try and get to the bottom of what's wrong with me. I was scared to be alone when i was little and didn't seem to know how to easily make friends; as a child i watched everyone else have fun with each other and hope maybe someone would join me play too as I played by myself, and when I did become friends with someone, they threatened to stop being friends with me and I sobbed for ages. This was when I was maybe 7 or 8. I get hurt by rejections and insults quite easily, leading people to laugh at me and call me ""overly sensitive"". I'm very self conscious and I know there's a lot of stuff that's ""off"" about me, so I feel very awkward and embarrassed and tend to blush if I feel there's someone watching me. I've had an existential crisis and cried a lot that day over it, and I've worried that my parents were lonely and unsatisfied as well, even though it seems that they don't care themselves. I feel bad for people if I KNOW that they're being manipulated or exploited in any form, but that as well seems to have slowly ceased as I became more self-centered. I don't seem to care about my friends anymore. In January I thought my friend had stopped caring about me and I sobbed over that too, trying to come up with some way to ""win her back"". Almost as if she were an object of sorts. I have felt bad for insulting people too, especially my more sensitive friends, but that's not an emotion I've felt for a very long time. I don't know whether I ""love"" my friends either, though I get flattered when they tell me that they love me. It's like my connections with people have to be super strong and fresh to make me happy, as it makes me feel I have a ""purpose""; to make this other person happy. But when that feeling fades and I get ""bored"" of the friendship, it gets depressing for me all around. I have felt lonely at times, and did once try to ask my parents what to do, but they shot it down by saying I already had one friend at the time, so I simply COULDN'T be lonely. I love little kids, though I don't have the natural ""motherly"" ability to properly handle them and their emotions. I'm not sure how to handle anyone's emotions, including my own. Compliments make me happy and can motivate me, usually school-based ones, but can also sometimes make me cry for reasons I don't know. People asking if I'm okay also tend to make me sob further. I've felt fear and apprehension before, and when I was little I was very scared of things like aliens and the Mothman, of all things. I was scared of them bursting through my window and attacking me, and the same for burglars. They were all very irrational fears and I never really talked to my parents about them, for fear of being ridiculed and not taken seriously, and arrogance also played into there too; I felt I knew ""better"" than they did, yet compared to teachers and other adults I know, I feel they're much wiser than me. It's like I undervalue and underestimate my parents. There was also a language barrier, as I'm not fluent in their native language so there's a lot of stuff I didn't know how to say. And in turn, I never really took them seriously either, though I know I should. I was an incredibly polite child, but also quite controlling, looking back on it, and cried and threw tantrums when I didn't get my own way. I've held admiration for people, and have also had crushes too, albeit quite a shallow one. I'm starting to think I only like people if they serve me any purpose, entertainment or to satisfy any of my needs. I've felt immense sadness at sad things, but they're not the ""usual"" things that make people cry; abusing children in any form is what usually gets me to cry, and seeing babies and small children neglected also makes me sad. I cry when I think about killing myself sometimes because of how my sister would feel. I don't want her to feel like that on my account. Thinking back to when people were horrible to me as a kid makes me cry. Maybe it's because, internally, I don't feel like I'm 16. I feel more like a 5 year old, who tends to go between overvaluing and idealising someone (especially if they're nice to me) to quickly undervaluing someone, based on the smallest thing. I have felt nostalgia before too, usually to times when I was younger and less aware of the world and could just get on with things without having to worry about other people. I was quite an independent and mature child and tended to do things by myself for as long as I could remember, and only grudgingly accepted help. My assumption was that my parents didn't care much about my studies and as long as I was doing well, it was fine. Gratitude, sometimes, but incredibly fleeting, and I'm not good at showing emotion and gratitude anyway. I don't know whether I've had feelings of worthlessness before, but I have felt useless when people tell me about things that i wish i could solve. When people show care for me outside of times when I cry, that usually also makes me cry too. Not sure why though. I also tend to feel a lot of self pity as well, and describing my oh so sad circumstances to myself can make me cry too. I've read things in books that can very occasionally move me to tears, and they're the oddest things too. Things like shame and remorse, I'm not really sure whether I've felt them or not. Shame probably, for insulting someone or talking to someone rudely, usually to people of authority outside of my parents. Remorse? The ""I wish I hadn't done that"" sort of emotion? Also yes, but again, I'm not sure whether it's the ""normal"" version of remorse. I seem to sway between extreme emotion and almost cold, cruel logic. It makes me wonder if I'm a sociopath or something. 

I talked to a counsellor today about some of my issues, saying I didn't know who I was and my emotions were all over the place or nonexistent, and she said I'm definitely not a psychopath. Maybe, but if not that, I feel I must have ASPD or sociopathic tendencies. And thinking that I do brings me to tears in itself. I think I probably would kill myself if it was confirmed that I did have it. I'd tell my friends and family what an awful person I am, how gross I am beneath the surface and that I don't deserve to live and cause them any more misery than I already have. I don't know whether i truly FEEL that sentiment, but it'd provide an excuse for me to kill myself. Life is boring and I don't see much hope for the future. Occasionally, I can, but those moments are far and few in between and don't hold much water. I can't bring myself to care immensely about these exams anymore. What they produce are just letters on a page, that might let me do things in the future that again, I can't be bothered to care about. Travel sounds interesting but I don't think I'd ever be truly satisfied. I feel almost animalistic in a sense, no care for anyone besides myself and my fleeting feeling of pleasure. And I'm just getting sick of it. I think I just want it to end now. Life brings me no joy. I seem to lack the ability to really love anyone for any other reason than them flattering me, I have no interests in anything, and my emotions are just very unstable and fleeting and numb. Even immense joy fades because I know it won't last. I have awful commitment issues to anything and have only done things to meet an end, rather than for my own enjoyment. Life feels like I'm constantly quelling boredom and battling my internal thoughts and feelings. It's times like these where I seriously consider taking my own life, because I live such a half-life anyway. I feel the only reason my parents like me is because I'm the ""high achiever"".It's the same reason I like myself and why everyone else also likes me; I'm the ""smart"" kid. There's not much substance beyond that, besides my tendency to make AWFUL puns. I don't even feel much shame for feeling suicidal, though my parents do try to make me feel shame. It's more a battle in myself, between trying to be a good person while internally feeling very little of it. I don't feel ""alive"" and I don't feel like it's gonna get any better either; the out of school therapy I could go to is fully booked for the maximum next 10 weeks, and I don't want everyone in school to know how mentally fucked I am by me talking to the psychiatrist in school. But then again, I've lost the ability to care. I'm probably gonna do mediocre on my GCSEs and disappoint everyone, and live a life as an internet hermit while stacking shelves at Tesco's. I'm only just realising how screwed up my worldview is. I wish I was normal, I wish to God I was anyone else, anyone at all. Anyone who could function and not be horrible and have coordinating thoughts and feelings and be happy and motivated and love people and have goals. I have nothing of the sort. I feel happy when I feel affection towards a friend or family member because that's how abnormal I am, how rare it is. I tell myself occasionally that ""I'M GOING TO STUDY"" maybe everyday at 6pm or something, but it never comes to fruition because I then wonder whether I truly WANT to study and get good grades, or whether it's just because I feel like I should, as everyone else is. I find myself animalistic and have the potential of causing misery to everyone and not care about it. I don't really know what to do anymore, and if I even care enough to change anything about it. Maybe 6 months back I did, but not anymore. I'm past the point of giving a shit now. I scrutinise my morals and actions and beliefs in an attempt to figure out what truly IS me and what feels right, yet I never get anywhere in fear I'll land on the ""wrong"" conclusion. But then the fear of me doing so makes me think I'm just scared to admit to myself I'm a sociopath, and acknowledging it would give me the excuse to just be a horrible person. Everyone tells me I'm going to go far, and have lots of potential, and maybe I do, but I have no innate drive to do so. I'll end up as one of those child prodigies that dropped out of school and ended up living a dud life. The perfectionist within me wants me to stay alive so I can have the chance of being a fully functioning, ""normal"" human being, but I don't think I'll stick around that long, My dad said he doesn't want his child to die, so I've been using that as a reason to stay alive, but again, my capacity to ""give a shit"" is being used up. I don't even feel depressed while writing this, fairly clear-headed, but it's more there's a block between me and the feeling of shittiness. I'm preferring this block right now. I know I need to ""process my emotions"" but I can't think of anywhere to do it. Everyone gets annoyed or overly concerned when I cry. And I can't seem to force myself to do it either. Nighttime is when usually I feel calmer and more emotionally sound and complete, but it follows with me waking up the next morning feeling like an absolute mess. I can't seem to sleep very well nowadays, and I don't think I've slept very well for the last year or so; I never feel fully awake after sleeping, and some nights I'm so restless that I can't sleep at all. And the oddest thing is, I swing between so many different ""states"" of myself that it means I don't know who I am anyway. Which one of these states is the ""real"" me? This might just be normal teenage emotions, but I dislike the more shady parts of myself. I read a story about someone who was a ""good"" person for a long time until they realised they were had OCD that made them act ""good"" and that they were actually a sociopath beneath all of that. I've wondered whether I'm like that too until suddenly the feeling fades and I then randomly feel all happy and more human and emotional again. I feel like I missed out on some lesson where they taught everyone how to be a normal human being and feel love and care for people and myself. I don't seem to care about myself, or anyone else. Yet sometimes I do, then the feeling quickly fades and we're back where we started. What a mess. I just don't feel like a ""complete"" person anymore; I used to assume that everyone felt like this, and realising it's just me makes me feel alienated and creepy to everyone else. I wish I was like everyone else.

Anyone, any advice? Do I have mild sociopathy/psychopathy? Am I developing ASPD? Have I always had ASPD? What do I do about it?",10Mar2018,1

51,"Right, for the most part of my life my family has caused me stress, but It's been avoidable for the past decade or so and I haven't been truly that bothered by It. At 18, I've found that I've been pondering a lot (maybe obsessively) about the effects of the poor parenting from my Mom and Dad and the somewhat poor behavior from my siblings (and how going to my best friends house and being at boarding was the only way I could escape family stress)and now is when part of the resentment and frustration has come through. I still have a few problems with them here and there, but I think I have come to terms with the idea that they'll betray my expectations (though I will still get disappointed and frustrated at times) and whatever I do here on Is my fault because I've decided to submit to those side effects and be defeated by them.

So, I'm on a gap year and at the start of It I was particularly lively and generally the normal introverted person I've been, but 8 months of following the same routine (binging movies and tv shows, playing video games for hours on end, taking a shower at least once a week, spending all day In my dark bedroom without opening the curtains and sleeping between 6:00 and 8:00 AM) and having to endure the stress from my family I've started to feel morose (or at least I think that's the feeling and that's what the following statement is about). TBH I don't know why I'm asking this, maybe I just need to talk about It, but this is what I'm confused about. Because of the recent feelings I'm having (They'd happen on and off during the past 8 months, but It was the start of March when the feelings were more poignant than ever before), my conclusion has usually been that I am depressed. But could I simply be replacing boredom with the feeling of depression (I ask this, because I know my Dad would be completely against It If I go to a doctor or therapist about this)? I know It's a weird question, but any information would be appreciated (Even If It doesn't answer the issue at hand.).

Note: I recently went through an identity crisis last year during my gap year where I described that I wanted to have problems to fit In. It's a weird sentiment, but that's where my head's at. To add to that, It's during this gap year that I heard of Reddit and I've come to be way more engaged with It and browsing It everyday. Could that be responsible for what I'm feeling In anyway.",10Mar2018,1
52,"The last few days I have had extreme anxiety .. I’ve always been super social and I travel a lot and am okay being In new places . I literally have gotten anxious leaving and being further then 20 miles from home. .. 

I have no idea where this came from. I have a job I like . Broke up wth a shitty person 8 months ago .. don’t have any major stress .. my job at the moment is stressful due to an event we are putting on but I can’t complain it’s in Hawaii ... 

I have felt so scared and hopeless ... yesterday I called a warm line and was able to talk to someone .. I think my anxiety is coming from unresolved stuff from the guy I broke up with ..

He was extremely verbally abusive  and controlling . If I didn’t do what he said he would get angry and ignore me but expect me to fix everything and chase after him. ... everything was a fight .. how long I worked on weeknights ; start up culture Job ) how if I went and had dinner with a friend I was supposed to check in with him  ( could only do this during the week as weekends I was suppose to be with him ) and when I didn’t ( it was a 2 hour dinner ) he flipped out and said I should be checking in on “home” 

“Home”? At that point we had only been together 2 mos. it wasn’t like I lived with him and left him with our infant child ... 

He would also expect me to pay for everything as he was a single dad and I should understand his situation . Basically if I couldn’t cover him then whatever it was I couldn’t go to it . We went to a huge festival last year where I pretty much paid his way and he threw it in my face that we were only there for “me” he also threw a fit when he realized it’s not easy to get drugs there . He finally got some and here is where my mental health got affected

I did a tiny bit with him , I hadn’t done anything in years . I had a bad trip in result and had to go to the medical tent where they told me my bad trip probably had to do with my state of mind ( which was negative thanks to him ) he screamed at me the first day at the festival angry and told me when you love someone it doesn’t matter what it is , you make it happen ( so if you don’t get your partner a narcotic drug your a piece of shit ) so I think the hostility caused me a bad trip. They gave me a pill to calm me down ( atavan) and they took care of me

The next day I was shaken but knew we could go to the final day sober . He chose to do drugs again but this time he didn’t feel it and he got super paranoid and anxious and made us leave early .. 

I broke up with him about 2 months later . I was sick of him and his kids and his life

He was also still married which he hadn’t told me . And made every excuse why they couldn’t file ( some property issue ) 

But the anxiety I felt these past days felt like the bad trip anxiety . It was so bad it took over me .


I am being kind to myself and bought some healing lotion ( aroma ) and I have lavender and I haven’t had coffee and I’m just being peaceful it’s almost gone the anxiety but this shits no joke 

I vow to talk to someone about the abusive I faced with him and work on healing ...",10Mar2018,2
53,"I just feel like nobody will ever like or want to go out with me. I just feel sad all the time. I went on a date last Saturday and the guy texts me two days later and says ""want to have sex? Haha"" I sent him a couple messages on the dating website I met him on and he read them but didn't reply. There's another person I talk to on the dating website and he was online tonight but never messaged me (and he always messaged me every day). I just feel extremely sad and unwanted by everyone. I work and live alone and have nobody to talk to. I always feel like a burden to everyone. It's like I live with a big hole in my heart 24/7. I can't find a date in person. I can't find one online and I just don't know what to do. I hate the way I look and feel about myself. A lot of people say I'm pretty on the dating website but then tell me that they just want to fuck me.



When I was younger, I was always the one that was left out by everyone. My mom never seemed to care about me. To her it was always about my younger brother and sister. She kicked me out the minute I turned 18. I didn't feel wanted or loved at all. I just feel like everyone hates me or just want something from me.



What should I do?",10Mar2018,1
54,"So I never told my gp about my drug use(just smoking weed) for fear of any repercussions. 

If i was to tell the psychiatrist what’s the worst case scenario of me telling them I occasionally smoke weed. 

What’s the worst case of me not telling them. ",10Mar2018,1
55,"So basically for 7 months now I am suffering from hopefully Suicide-OCD, I was diagnosed with OCD 2 times, and 1 time the doctor said it might be adjustment disorder but it does not describe my symptoms well.

So basically, it all started after reading about Chester Bennington's suicide, about 7 months ago, then I started having intrusive thoughts about it, then I googled it, started reading about depression, then I had a major panic attack, to the point of vomitting.(Yes, I know this is a typical trigger for OCD and this is how it usually starts, I had OCD episode 5 years ago, but can't remember exactly if it was the same.) Anyway, here is what happens.

**My symptoms are:**

- Knot in the stomach when it is bad, always.

- Butterflies like in the stomach when I am good.

- Obsessive thinking.(Don't know if it is obsesssive though, It is like I get intrusive thought or feeling, then I the knot in the stomach appear and I start thinking about possible diagnoses etc. And the thought keeps feeling real. I am irritable in those moments. (I know it sounds like OCD, so far, but **don't jump to conclusions yet.**)

'Life is meaningless' feeling. It is not like the depression feeling. More like the existential way, but still doesn't feel existential. It feels kind of synthetic. It is based on few things:

- Thoughts like 'What is the point of working when I will die one day?' Etc.

- Dark high contrast, low brightness pics of my future, not consious, like stuck in the back of my head, can't see them clearly, they are random, for example at the moment it is like me standing at the bus stop in my university, the image is drone like. And other weird stuff.

- It is usually triggered when I imagine doing something nice or just living a normal life, like a lost feeling? I don't know how to describe it.

- It is like in the end of life nothing happens.(I know it is irrational it is fucking weird and always accompanied with anxiety.

- Like a flat life feeling. Again, not emptiness like depression.

- It is strongly connected to working.
Other symptoms include:

**Other symptoms:*

- Irritability when it is bad.

- Sudden feeling of trapped in life, like I want to escape, but there is no escape.

- Sudden feeling like everything I see is too much. Looking at my room for example. Like overload?

- Feeling like if I work in the future I will do it.(For example my mother told me that I can start working at a store and instant images of me working then at the end of working I do it, it is like if i work for a week I will do it. It is terrifying. It comea with a knot in the stomach and mood drop.

- Feeling like if this condition is gone and I continue to live a normal life I will do it. It almost feel like I want these things to be there, but at the same time I am terrified of them, but at the same time I am terrified of them leaving.

- Feeling like a dark cloud is setting over my future and I can't see my usual future because of those pictures and feelings, again ALWAYS accompanied with anxiety.(Again, not quite like the depression thing.)

- In the morning, before I fully woke up I am in this weird half-awake condition when those feelings and thoughts like attack me? But at the same time it feels super real, like me. Then I can't go back to sleep, I stanf up, make coffee and those things usually last about hours, then I get almost to my normal self. However, when it is bad, it is bad all day and I have multiple times through the day when I feel normal for a couple of mins, then it hits again.

- Doubt if I want it or not and extreme confusion over it. It is more like 'I want it but I am pretending not to.', 'I don't want to admit it', 'Don't fully realise it.' And when this is there it feel legit, like I really want it BECAUSE of those feelings, which is horrific. It feels 100% like me.

- I am avoiding asking myself if I want to do it or if I want to die because:
  - When I do it it feels like I do which is making everything worse.
  - Or I say no, but with extreme anxiety and then yes appears and feels 100% like me which is scary.

- Gets worse after an arguing. Hits hard and my anxiety goes up all the way. (I thought It was BPD , but I researched a lot and it does not sound like me.)

It seems to have a cycle:

**When I am feeling okay:**
Bad in the morning.
Then I feel fine, then in the afternoon it hits and my mood drops, then usually at midnight I feel okay.

**When it is bad:**
The whole day is bad and I have minutes when I feel okay, then it hits again.

The most scary thing in this condition are **the urges**.

They almost everytime come without any reason or 
after days of worrying, it induces a panic attack in which everything hits at once.

Urges:

When I am close to dangerous objects.(Power sockets, high buildings, medications, etc. You get it.(I know it sounds like OCD, but still, wait, **don't jump to conclusions yet**.)

Urges are caused by thoughts like:

'Cmon, it will be so easy.'(This one is terrifying.)

'Life is meaningless anyway'

'I want to do it.'

'Why don't just give up.'(And it feels super real like I am about to give up.)

Etc. Etc. Etc. 

I am terrified.

**Background description of the urges:**

So, they happen when I am feeling relatively okay, then I can tell it is probably OCD. HOWEVER, when it is bad or hits bad out of nowhere here is how it feels like:
Like a flat life feeling, with the things, I mentioned before. And the scariest thing is that it feels like 1000% like me and like a decision. 

It is terrifying. I can only tell that it was not me when I am fine, but then, it hits again. 

**The scary thing is that it feels like I have anxiety because I want it and resist it or because I know it is not right**

**The second scary thing is that I can't tell if intrusive suicidal thoughts trigger feelings(good.) Or the feelings trigger real suicidal thoughts.**(**bad.**)

Here is how it happens and what it looks like:

**03.03.2018:**

I am watching a TV show, feeling relatively fine, when I decide to see if the feeling is in background. I suddenly get a thought like 'I can't continue living.' With a very fucking real feeling like I really don't and all of those feelings hit. It feels horrific. I am immediately not sleepy, In highly self aware state, with like racing thoughts(not exactly.) I feel the knot in the stomach, it feels real, I immediately turn off the show on my phone and message a person who has the same thing as me at the moment. I stand up and go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. **IT STILL FEELS SUPER REAL AND 100% LIKE ME** I light my ciggarete and my vision crosses arround the power socket on the wall as soon as I see it thought like 'I want to do it' appear or 'It is pointless' I can't remember the thought exactly it felt super fast. After this a feeling like I want to give up appears like I am about to do it. An urge to look back at the power socket appears. I open reddit and start to write this topic. As I am writing I calm down and it feels less real and turns into 'background' again. As I am writing I have mini hits lasting a few seconds which makes it real again. As I wrote this sentence the same thing happened.


**Panic attacks:**
Basically the same thing, but in more intense way. More intense urges. 
Etc. Etc. I am even not sure if it is a panic attack or something worse.

**After a panic attack I calm down, but the next few days it is so fucking bad.** 

So I have researched a lot about this topic and they are several diagnosis I want to mention and to say few things about them:

I am extremely scared that it is **suicidal depression.** However I looked at the symptoms here is what I get:

- Hopelessness (I am not sure about this, I can't tell if the meaningless thing is hopelessness. And as soon as I mentioned hopelessness I felt like I am feeling hopeless which gives me knot in the stomach.)

- Worthlessness - I don't have it.

- Guilt - I sometimes have it over the thoughts.

- Sadness - I don't have it.

- Emptiness - I don't have it.

- Depressed mood - Can't tell.

- Lost in interest in usual activites. (I can't tell if I get this, I tend to only research or reread articles about this topic when I am feeling bad, and I am not able to do nothing else. I tend to have moments when I don't want to go out because of this knot in the stomach and the other stuff, I 'preffer' to be at home and reading stuff.)

- Tiredness - After a long day when it is bad, yes.

- Oversleeping - I usually sleep about 8 to 9 hours.

- Low self esteem - I don't have it.

- Feeling burden - I don't have it.

- Lost of apetite - When the knot in the stomach is there, yes, like my stomach is sick.

- Suicidal thoughts (As you probably read already, I get this, however, in depression, it is associated with relief, fantasies, and CONSIOUS THINKING.(As I am typing this I feel like it is giving me relief and like I feel consious about it, which makes the condition worse - the knot in the stomach gets worse. 

**Told my psychiatrist and psychologist about it, they said it is not depression** However I am not sure.

My next fear is **Bipolar Affective Disorder Type 2**:

Bipolar is known to cause depression and hypomania.
I looked at the symptoms of mania and hypomania.
I asked most of my friends and family if they seen any of the symptoms(I showed them a list of the symtpoms.) In me and they dismissed it.
I also analysed my mood and actions while I am fine. 

I tend to do the things I usually do, for the same time. 

I don't sleep less. 

I don't talk faster. 

I am not easily distracted.

I don't do reckless stuff. 
And most importantly my mood does not change completely from the bad mood. Also it tends to change during the day. 

**The thing which is worrying me is that I am more irritable than usual.**

Anxiety symptoms which I have:

- Irritability.

- Sweating and BAD sweat smell, worse than usual.(My hands sweat when I am bad, however they were always sweating since I am young so I don't know if it fits there.

- Knot in the stomach.

- Derealisation.(Sometimes.)

- Restlessness.

- Faster highrate.

- Headaches sometimes.

- Unsettledness

I am sure that I missed something. Feel free to ask questions if you have. Thanks in advance and have a good night.

**P.S. I am aware that this is probably reasurance seeking, but however it feels too real to be OCD and in fact I am not sure if I didn't missed something. I know too that the feeling like I didn't described everything is probably OCD, but still.**
