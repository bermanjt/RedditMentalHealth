0,"ive just started therapy after putting a lot of thought into past behaviours of mine that are rather manipulative. i keep myself up at night thinking about all the people i have hurt and i really want to fix this. without playing the victim card as i know manipulators often do, i believe my behaviour is partly learned from my parents. i grew up in a pretty toxic household (lots of controlling, manipulative behaviour from both parents with both verbal/physical abuse) i know that this in part has definetly affected how i have acted/act now.

without going into detail about my actions in the past, as im gonna leave that to the analyzation of a professional, is there any hope for me? above all else i want happiness for myself and those around me. i dont want to hurt anyone anymore, and i am more than willing to commit to therapy and taking responsibility for my actions in order to better myself.",15May2018,1,
1,"Hey Reddit- 
I've been having some good ""ups"" lately, and I wanted to pay forward the kindness that's been shown to me in the past. 

I'm not a professional, and I'm not a therapist- but if you need someone to talk to, I'm here to help. 

Obviously, I can't help with every issue or handle every situation- so I'd appreciate if you can comment below about what you'd like to talk about. I'll do my best to reply to every comment, and PM the ones I think I might be able to help and connect with. I can also do my best to provide resources to you as well, if I'm able. 

Hope to hear from some of you soon! ",15May2018,2,
2,"I really freak myself out. When I step back and look at the people I've been attracted to, there's a pattern, they are all mentally ill. Why the hell, right? is it because of some sick fantasy that I don't fully realize, or is it that I want to date people who understand me. Earlier today in class I zoned out. I saw a grenade go through the window into the classroom, it blew up and i watched as people flew like ragdolls, and then I snapped out of it. I was terrified, I just imagined people I know dying and I didn't even care. I'm scared.",15May2018,2,
3,"Life is so predictable...its not even funny. I dont have depression, I'm a high school senior who is relatively good with socializing with others, everyone who knows me sees me as a very calm and reserved person. I love talking to people and learning about them, but I never really connect with them. Same case with my own family. I care about them and love them, but I dont feel love.

I've had a history of having this mindset in which I feel superior to everyone. I love fantaszing about absolute power and control over others...and just manipulation really. As a child I felt abused and bullied...so honestly I feel that i deserve better. I deserve revenge.

I recently found it so easy to find girls to date using dating apps (which gets boring) because they are all just as dull and similar. I remember one relationship that was toxic and lasted two years...but I loved it. It had obsession, passion, intensity...and I especially loved feeling like I was in control. But now that life feels like a long road, I cant help but to want something exciting to happen, to feel that rush going in your blood to fucking do shit. Violence is just something I have come to embrace throughout these years.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but rather what people think of it and if this is normal. Give me a reason why I should change...because honestly...I dont have any.",15May2018,1,

I'm wondering if anyone else has heard of or understands my experience? At birth I was assigned to two different identities, because I was born in two different bodies. Because of this I was forced to grow up living two different lives, until last year my two bodies found each other. I do my best these days to remain one whole person at all times. However, no one accepts my identity, and so just to make a living, I'm forcibly lobotomized everyday. (That is, forced to put my two brains out of contract) It wouldn't do any good to ask my employer to hire ""my other body"", although I have tried to get him to hire my so-called partner.

7,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life now. Lately it's been getting really bad. I talk to my family about it, but nothing is getting better. 
So to start off, i'm a 15 year old girl. I transferred schools this past year due to my anxiety. I am shy and have a hard time talking to people, so making friends was a challenge. I eventually made a couple really good friends. The school year ended two weeks ago, and that's when I really started going downhill. I lock myself in my room all day, I lost interest in my hobbies, and have had extremely low energy. I am constantly thinking so low on myself. I am so lonely. I want to tell my friends what i'm going through, but I don't want them to see me in a different way, or think i'm a downer.

8,"Is in a little bit over two weeks from now. It feels a bit strange. Perhaps even a bit scary. During yesterday’s session, I didn’t get to ask any questions. With one session left to go, there’s no way I will get all of my questions answered. This is something that bums me out. I have so many questions! 

Anyway, it’ll be my last because I feel like I can’t deal with therapy anymore. I have, and will continue to, refused all offers of writing a referral to someone for treatment. It hurts to see someone with their lives in order when I realize it’ll never happen to me. It’s difficult. I wrote about this in length in my last post if you wish to read it. Anyway, it makes me sad. I could see someone else, but I’ll just risk continuing to get hurt. And it feels so much worse than at other times. If I’m in therapy, the ones that are treating me are the only ones I can actually talk to. And that hurts a lot. I have no one in my personal life I can talk to, and the only ones I can talk to forgets about me as soon as I walk out the door... and then they go home to their regular and happy lives, while I go home and wait for the next session.

I’ve also lost all hope that I can ever get any help. I lost all hope in December last year, but I’ve continued with therapy because I like talking to my psychologist so much, and because I have a lot of questions. But I can’t take this anymore. I’m pulling the plug.

But it isn’t all bad news! The good news are as follows: I have started to do things on my own so I can try to enjoy life a little bit. I sometimes go out with my bicycle. I am planning on going to the cinema next weekend (or the weekend after). When I move out, I am planning on traveling around the country to see new places, go to concerts (music is important to me), and do other crazy stuff such as riding my bicycle to a beautiful location, sit down, and then eat strawberries while watching the sunset. I’m going to try to enjoy the beautiful nature we have here! I also wish to take my bicycle with me around the country so I can ride my bike some new places as well. 

You see? It isn’t all bad! And mind you, even though I am done with therapy, I am without a doubt willing to join a group for people with Aspergers. I just won’t do anymore therapy. Someone told me about a group for people with Aspergers who meets up regularly and eat pizza or goes out bowling. I would definitely join something like! Sadly, this was neither in the town I live in now, nor the one I am moving out to. But if there are any... well, I guess I won’t be doing things alone all of the time. Just most of the time.",15May2018,2,
9,"Hi y'all. 18F here with depression and generalized and social anxiety. I've been talking to my parents about getting a therapist while I am home for the summer (I have one at my out-of-state school who highly suggested it). Now, my parents and my mom in particular have never been the kind to go to doctors without some glaring reason, and neither have ever really dealt with mental health issues or therapists.

I recently had a conversation with my mom about my mental health. We have a good relationship but her ways of dealing with things are very different from mine, and she has never had a great understanding of mental health issues. She's trying her best to understand, but needs to do research to get further in the process. I've offered to help because I really want my parents to understand that what I'm dealing with is an actual problem that needs therapy, not normal things I'm just being dramatic about. I'm looking into the repetitive thought symptom specifically myself, as well as just general sites that explain the causes and symptoms of anxiety and depression.

10,"Hey there, a few months ago I started a new medication to help with mood stability called Abilify, and it has done wonders for my mood swings and overall quality of life, and admittedly, my life has gotten so much better with the help of this medication. However there is a downside.

It has caused me to become much more impulsive with spending money, as well as going to bars / smoking. I am on an extremely tight budget and things are going downhill because I don't think before I do these things and just spend the little bit of money I have despite having significant school expenses approaching next semester.

I have tried controlling myself but I honestly don't know how, I haven't really smoked before in my life but it's just so easy to walk down and buy a pack, only to deeply regret it 15 minutes later and become very frustrated with myself.

12,"So I’ve been struggling every day with panic attacks and feeling very anxious.  It always happens when I wake up and I try to ignore it but sometimes it gets so severe my heart beats extremely fast, along with chest pains also. Feeling so out of it also.  I tried Zoloft and it increased it all. So I cake off Zoloft, then went onto Prozac and that also made my panic so much worse, so 2 weeks in I felt terrible still so I came off them cause I cannot handle feeling anxious everyday.

13,"I'm wondering if my experience is like anyone else's. I'll try to be as objective as I can. I just really, really need answers.

I'll start with The Story: I've had depression since I was maybe eleven or twelve. No official diagnosis, no meds, no conversation with parents. Self-diagnosed over time with research. I've had ongoing (though now less frequent) experience with self harm and occasional rounds of suicidal thoughts or gestures. More recently, I've been having what I think are dissociative episodes, where I might forget that I'm connected to my physical self or why my physical body matters.

Now to the problem: I don't always know if this is legitimate. A few friends have told me it is, encouraged counseling and meds, etc. But I've been telling myself the depression story for years with no real diagnosis. I'm not always 100% functional, but isn't that normal? Even when I'm feeling depressed, I don't know if I actually am or if I'm making it up because I want attention, I expect to be depressed, or I'm just thinking about depression (like a placebo effect).

14,"Ive been this way a while now , years probably. And until moving into a relatives home recently I guess I just didnt notice it anymore , numb maybe? But they have brought it to my attention because they just dont understand how I can be that way. 

But I dont ever get excited about anything , or feel satisfaction upon reaching goals no matter how big.

I knew about the excitement thing , since Ive been that way since my late teens. Alot of abuse and bullying etc ... basically I learned ""had beat into me metaphorically speaking"" that getting excited about something was a trap. Because it would lead to disappointment and pain. So eventually after years of disappointments alot of which were purposefully brought upon me by my abusers my excitement just faded away.

Now I know life is full of failures and disappointments but it can also lead to achievements and reaching goals on the flip side. I get that. But when I reach a long sought after goal , like I got my GED earlier this year. When I got it and passed , I had a flicker...and I mean a mere second where I was like...i did it. then instantly , nothing. I felt nothing...it was just gone. While my relative was so excited and bragging to other famiy members...i didnt care anymore. My GED certificate is literally laying in a pile of mail in the corner.

I feel no satisfaction at all after reaching my goal. Or any goals ive met before. I set them because they are beneficial to me and i reach them  ,then Im done. No feeling , no emotion or satisfaction. Usually anxiety during the process but after nothing. GED was hard for me because Iam not good at math , but it will lead me to a better job and more money. But no sense of achievement.

I dont feel depressed , well depressed like I used to be. Ive been better. I would say Im more frustrated and angry anymore than anything. I feel Like Im trapped and cant move forward in life. I cant make up my mind what I want to go to college for because I dont have anything that interests me academically.  SO Im probably going to get financial aid and go for Welding in the fall. Its good money around here at the shipyards  and I hate my current job. I figure I can be miserable anywhere so I might aswell get paid more. 

I just dont want to be this way anymore. I cant feel excitement  , but I watch others around me enjoy it. I cant feel satisfaction upon reaching goals , but I see others around me happy for me. Im also this way when recieving compliments , I feel nothing..and if its at work I figure they have a motive behind their words and thus are meaningless to me.

Im also tired of feeling so full of emotions inside I could burst , but unable to release them outside due to being put down by others for it "" not talking  excitement or satisfaction here"" but Im tired of not being able to be myself...Im super sensitive and have been since childhood , and all i ever hear when I slip up and my ""socializing mask"" falls off for a moment and Im myself is that Im to sensitive and to toughen up...or that I need to stop being sensitive...but i dont want to. I like being the way Iam in regards to this , I dont think theres anything wrong with being sensitive , alot of people now a days are the opposite. Problem here is I can only be myself when Im alone. 

I guess i havent relized just how good Ive gotten at wearing masks for others so that they dont hurt me. Guess I could be depressed , atleast I feel that way now after writing this lol.. :(",15May2018,1,

26,"It's #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek, and yesterday marked 11 months since the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower that killed 71. It seems the perfect time to talk about the impact it's had on me, and to put a few tips out there.

Firstly, let's remember that it's okay not be to be okay. We all have troubles and woes, and not all of them are things we can deal with alone. Seeking help makes you a stronger person, not a weaker one.

I'd also remind people that mental illness is exactly that — a illness of a complex organ, namely the brain. Physical health and mental health are more linked than many people care to think.

Anyhow, to provide some background on Grenfell Tower and my role. The tower was a 24-story fire-trap, which caught fire on 14 June, 2017. The fire spread up the flammable cladding on the outside, and people stood no chance.

I watched that tower burn live through the night, and saw people live and die, which was really tough. I decided I needed to do something, and I offered my support to a group of local volunteers to replace a Google Doc full of resources with a website.

We set that website up, and received incredible numbers of people. Over 8,000 people offered to help those affected, and over 200,000 people visited our website in the first two weeks followed the tragedy. We got featured in local, national, and international media.

On the outside, everything seemed to be going well. Inside, however, it was hitting me — flashbacks to that night, sleep paralysis at times, and some really rough thoughts. It was really hard, to be honest, and I kept quiet.

Mental health, especially in men, is often ridiculed — just ""man up"", they'd say. There's no support out there for ad-hoc volunteers, or so I thought. I told myself it would go away eventually.

But it didn't. I sought counselling at my College, which really helped. I was told I was suffering from ""secondary trauma"", and things all began to become clear — I was a victim too, albeit in a different way. I'm on the mend now, but I still have my rough days. We all do.

Seeking help is one of the bravest things any of us can do, and I'm really proud of myself for doing so. It was tough though — who wants to talk about their deepest troubles to a random stranger? Give it a go — for me.

I want to publicly commit to the #MHAW challenge — I'll be here for each and every one of you. If you're having troubles, send me a message and I'll listen. No unsolicited advice, no ""man-up"", just a pair of ears that understand.

Mental health is an illness. It's nothing more and nothing less. It's time that we recognise mental health for what it is. Sorry for the long post, but I think it's really important.

38,"22 F from America with depression.

I'm in college right now, and my college provides students with 10 free counseling sessions. Once those are used up, we have to seek outside help. I used up all my 10, so I've had to turn to different sources. 

At school, I had an INCREDIBLE therapist. Whenever I left her room, I felt strong and light hearted. I improved so quickly with her. She was very kind and encouraging, and funny and relatable.

This new one I'm trying out, not so much. She's my first outside therapist. I've only seen her twice, but I'm already skeptical. Because she's made me feel like shit. I've felt horrible about myself since leaving, and it's actually leaked into today. I feel more depressed and anxious since going, than I did when I hadn't gone.

She was a little harsh - saying what I did was rude when I explained some tough social situations, and said that I was at fault for my struggling social situations, just as my friends were at fault.

When I talked about my fear of the future, and how I want to be an artist but it's hard to make money, she basically affirmed my fears and implied I shouldn't go that route. 

I graduate in one semester, and never had an internship. When I said that, she made a face and a noise like ""holy crap, that's really bad.""

After I left her office, I cried in my car. I never felt that way with my past therapists, who were all kind and encouraging. Even if I was at fault for something, or I did something bad, they wouldn't say it straight to my face like this new therapist. They'd say it in a gentler way. My past therapists also always sat at attention, and this one kind of lounges. Which I understand needing to be comfortable, but it kind of makes me feel like I'm boring her.

Tough love doesn't work for me. I need kindness and understanding.

I've been having obsessive thoughts about my ex-gf for the last 6 months. Our break up came out of no where and wasn't due to fighting, another guy, or a fundamental difference in opinion on something relationship/life related. It actually happened during a great night out between the two of us after things started to progress to a more serious thing.

I believe I actually fell into a depressed state at this time for the first 3-4 months (Nov -&gt; March) due to being unwilling to let go and hoping she would return. Wasn't eating, wasn't sleeping, couldn't think, couldn't enjoy anything ect. I feel like I've lost the last 6 months of my life.

Now here I am 6 months (almost to the day), still thinking about her during any down time. I am active. I do things with friends. But it all just ends up back to thoughts and fake conversations I have in my head with her. I haven't actually had contact with her since the night we broke up. I've seen her once maybe twice driving. It didn't bother me to see her. I actually didn't feel anything when I did. I normally get an adrenaline rush or something when I see an ex for the first couple of times. 

I don't really feel sad about her being gone anymore and I don't think I would just openly accept her back into my life if she were to return. So I am confused as to why / what I am holding onto by doing this?

I don't even recognize that I am having these thoughts until I am half way into a conversation in my head with her. I then try to stop, but a few moments later I am back at it.

48,"Hey guys,

I experienced some pretty bad burnout at the end of university and drank myself under the table for about a year. Now I'm finally trying to work in my field, and the burnout is back like it never left.

I'm not sure what to do. This whole thing is very quickly dissolving around me, it's very obvious I'm in over my head despite having qualifications. Rather than feel anxiety towards doing what I need to be doing I feel a placid calm over a high level general anxiety blanketing everything as I kind of withdraw into an increasing need to curl up in a ball and under the table and do drugs again. As though that would fix everything.

I feel like I'm experiencing stress other people can handle, but it's making me just quit functioning outright.

I'm probably going to lose my job soon-ish. The social anxiety has severely hampered my communications to keep on top of things, and stuff is falling apart. Worse yet, I do and do not care. The highest levels of my mind recognize what's wrong and do care. The baser regions do not give a shit and are hijacking my higher functions to avoid said stress.

Depression and anxiety made worse by employer

Okay, I live in the UK and I work(ed) in a high school; I’m categorically not returning to my employer since I’m terrified that I will be set up so I can be dismissed- they’re dodgy af. Currently applying for a new job in a different high school and it states that the required start is June 2018. 

Interviews are on the 25th May for what I’m applying for- if I were successful and got the job, that means I couldn’t start for a month which takes us to the 25th June. Although I know it is still technically a June start my main question is: 

Can I terminate my employment with immediate effect without serving a 1 month notice (which is the in the contract) since I haven’t been there since January, won’t be returning and also, they suck and don’t deserve any support.

61,"I wont give a long backstory, because it really is, long. But to say the least, im a self harming, degenerate, gambling, weed addicted alcoholic smoker with serious anxiety problems.

It all started with anxiety and that started back in school, after being bullied in 7 schools I finally found friends because I started smoking weed and smoking. From there it has really spiralled out of control.

I have had help with GPs ect and samaritans and hotlines and at the moment I have reached some mild stability and Im trying to cope with these things myself because I cant really get any free help and I cant afford real help, and Im also trying to keep my relationship slightly stable and trying to keep my dog alive. If it wasnt for my dog and my girlfriend, I probably wouldve killed myself already.

Anyway lately Ive been thinking a lot about suicide, but I can never go through with it, and nower days Ive been seeing people on the streets who I know FOR A FACT are terrible people that bullied me and everyone and steal from people and treat people like absolute shite and beat people up on the street for no reason and I KNOW that they just dont deserve to live, and ive been imagining ways I could kill them or hurt them without getting caught. Like riding by on my bicycle and stabbing them in the back whilst wearing a mask and then riding away.

Ive always had some kind of homicidal thoughts against these types of people but recently its getting more serious, and with my hard-to-control alcoholism its getting even tougher. 


The other day I saw a guy that was a real nasty piece of work, and I was incredibly drunk on a night out at about 4 am, I literally waited in an allyway and broke a glass bottle so Id be ready to stab him, but he didnt come down there so I ended up going home and my thoughts changed to self harm, and I quite badly stabbed myself to the point that Im still recovering now weeks later and it needed many many stitches. 

Now again recently im seeing the same guy and other guys who I know are pure scum and its all that runs through my mind. 

My question here is, and I dont want any kind of religious person to reply, but my question is, is it morally wrong to kill these people? I dont want to hear XY and Z about the law or about how I cant make that choice, I want to hear about morals, real morals. 
Is it morally wrong to remove someone from the earth that is clearly a burden on the majority of peoples normal lives? Should I do it? 

Im very far from a bad person, and even the idea of hurting someone would make me cry. The first and only person I ever punched - I was the one that ran away crying afterwards, because I felt so bad for hurting him. But these people that ruin our lives just drive me crazy, and im already clearly crazy anyway, so I cant help but focus my attention on this when I am trying so hard not to focus my attention on self harm, gambling, alcohol, weed, smoking, sex or anything else thats bad for me which I seem to be attracted to.

Basic Info: 18 M, 150 lbs.
Problem: Can't concentrate at all for extended periods of time.

To give some more-specific background information, I have poor eyesight. My vision isn't relatively poor, but it's been getting progressively worse as each year passes. Anyway, for at least the past several years, I have had great issues with concentrating. It feels as if it becomes impossible to focus my eyes, if you will, and from this sensation arises a general feeling of mind-fog. A dull mind, lack of concentration, lackluster reasoning abilities, whatever term applies, I just feel absent-minded for long periods of time. It's always related to the way my eyes feel (if they're focus or not). Sometimes, I just stare at anything and my mind goes blank. This state of dullness can last for months. Occasionally, I feel like I can focus my eyes and as a result, my thinking becomes more clear and sharp. This worries me because I'm a student and my mental abilities are obviously critical. The case used to be that I was able to focus myself for tests and other important assessments, but now I'm finding even that difficult. Wearing my glasses also tended to help, don't know if it was the placebo effect in action or whether there was actually something going on. I haven't seen much literature online that describes this issue I'm experiencing, but I think that this is some sort of psychological ailment that leads me to believe that my mind is dull.

If anyone could help me out-- a diagnosis, advice for dealing with this, be it meditation, medicine, etc.-- I would so greatly appreciate it because this problem is draining and it really affects me on a daily basis, to the point where not a day goes by without my thinking about it.
