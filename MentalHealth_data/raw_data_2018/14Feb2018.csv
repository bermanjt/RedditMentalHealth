My boyfriend is currently experiencing stress-induced psychosis. He is against taking the medication that was prescribed to him, so he is currently at a mental health facility in Georgia against his will. 

He is experiencing a lot of paranoia, so he thinks that his whole family is against him. His family and I are trying our best to help him through this difficult situation, but he is so deep into psychosis, that he shuts us out. He thinks the only thing for him to do is get released from the hospital and then leave the country.

I am currently trying to convince him to put me back on his approved list at the hospital (he removed all of us) and schedule a counseling session with me so I can help negotiate and get him the help that he needs. If he doesn’t do that, he is going to be at the mercy of the state. I have his power of attorney, but they are telling me that I can only make decisions for him if he is in a coma and not able to speak for himself. The doctors are not cooperating with me since we are not legally married. 

He is not himself at all right now at all. He has moments of clarity, but he is very confused about what is going on. He has been experiencing hallucinations and extreme mood swings. He is disconnected with reality.  He thinks that he is having a “spiritual experience” and that there is nothing wrong with him. He is a big believer in Jungian psychology and the theories of Stanislav Grof, and rejects any other explanations. 

I was by his side the entire time until he was taken to the hospital, and I have absolutely no doubt that this is stress-induced psychosis, not a “spiritual awakening.” However, I would like to respect his wishes as much as possible. I’m afraid that if we don’t do things the way he wants, he will be gone. I would like to try to get him to a facility with a more holistic approach, but it seems like those places don’t really exist around here (Georgia.) 

He experienced a lot of trauma in his life in 2015 and some things have popped up in his life that made him relive some of the events and it sent him into this situation. He made me promise to never take him to a hospital if something like this ever occurred, so I stayed at home with him for 17 days, hoping that he could come through this on his own. 

On the 17th day, it became too dangerous for both of us for it to continue on. He was trying to run away, and when I caught up with him, he started talking about performing a cleansing ceremony by setting both of us on fire. His dad and stepfather took him to the ER and then he was transferred to the facility that he is currently in. He has to be stabilized before he can leave. He is a danger to himself and others in his current state of mind.

I just want to him back. I personally think that he should take low dosages of an anti-psychotic to become stable again then focus on psychotherapy to work through the issues that brought this episode on. But, he is so against the medication and is convinced that he doesn’t need help that he is being completely unreasonable at the moment. What can we do? I don’t want him to get out and leave the country while he is still experiencing psychosis, but I don’t want him to be stuck in the facility that he is currently in. I feel like we are almost out of options. He will be in the current facility until the 20th, then they will determine if he is fit to be released or if he should be forced to take medication. We are running out of time.

Those girls were attractive, were very fit and in great shape, had friends, etc. After seeing this, I put my head down and just sat there for a minute. I'm nothing like them.

20,"Hi All,
There is a person in my immediate friend group, who I've grown to consider to be a toxic person, and have opted out of spending lots of time around them/with them. 
I recently found out about their struggles with mental health (depression and anxiety), and it opened my eyes up to why they may be acting irritable, distant, irrational, ect. It definitely gave me better understanding of what they were going through. After offering my help/support and talking about it with them, I was able to better understand their perspective on things.
Fast forward, some time has gone by, and this person has continued to treat me in negative/bad way. Therefore I still continue to consider this person to be toxic. My friends think this is really rude and disrespectful of me, and simply put, think I'm being unethical considering what this person is going through.

22,"Hi everyone,
I’m a 17 yr/old female and I’ve been on a combo of psych meds for several years now; initially diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and possibly mild OCD. I’ve been on and off of a number of things but ultimately what’s gotten me to a stable, consistent place in my life is a combo of Prozac and Wellbutrin. Every time I have a psych appointment my doctor comments on how strange it is that these two have worked well together for me because apparently they normally aren’t a good combo for depression/anxiety and the insurance company has been questioning it.
We talked at one point about the possibility of me having bipolar, a previous psychiatrist brought it up too. She suggested that the combination of meds Im on would typically be more effective for someone with bipolar disorder than what I’d previously been suggested to have. I can’t say much as to my temperament; I don’t think that’s something I can objectively evaluate very well and I haven’t been off medication since I was 14.
Thoughts? Would really appreciate any input from anyone who also suffers from depression, anxiety, or BP I or II, or from any mental health professionals. Thank you so much in advance! ",14Feb2018,1

I've had a meth addiction for quite some time now. A few hours ago, I ended up buying some fake shit. Looked completely legit but wasn't. I had a fire in my stomach that hurt so bad I started bawling. I went to message the dude on my Facebook and found out he blocked me. So I sat there for about 5 minutes seething with rage. This is definitely not the first time this had happened. Suddenly, I started laughing. Not just giggling, but full blown hysterical howls of laughter. 

How stupid was I for allowing myself to get ripped off after several times of it happening?? I could have done something useful with that money. So I just shook my head, smiling, and got onto another Facebook account and messaged him. I simply said ""We both know what you did, and it's alright. Karma will take care of it. Peace.""

I put my phone down and immediately got up,, put my meth pipe on the floor, and stomped it, shattering it.

25,"I’m sorry, I just need to let this out. Sorry for the string of negativity.

I feel exhausted by my mental health issues right now. I tried 3 antidepressants, they didn’t work. Since then, I’ve changed doctors, my therapist has suggested changing therapists (due to feeling like she has helped as much as she could), and I have gotten an appointment with a psychiatrist (in 1.5 weeks, now). Overall, that is not making me feel like I have any stable support.

I have felt horrible for the last month, at least. I think. It feels like it goes on forever. I have been actively trying to get help for a year, and it has just gotten worse during that year. Most prevalent is a numb feeling where I care about nothing. That’s been interspersed with feelings of depression and hopelessness. There have been very few good days lately. 

Now, I’ve had two good days in a row, and it’s gone. A brief conversation with my mom (no ill intent on her end), and I am stuck between that numb feeling and a feeling of guilt/depression/self-hatred.

I should be doing more. I want to do more. My lack of action is negatively affecting other people, as well as me. I don’t know how to do more when I don’t care about any of it. I don’t know how to do more when I feel like it is all depressing and hopeless. I want life to feel worthwhile, but it doesn’t feel like anything could possibly change or improve.

26,"Hi reddit,

I have GAD and bipolar. About a year ago, I started experiencing psychotic symptoms. They come rarely and don't last long, but they're pretty scary. Once, my stupid brain spent twenty minutes trying to convince me that my fiancee had been replaced by an alien who wanted to kill me (good times, huh?). My meds, psych degree, and years of therapy are enough to keep me under control, but lately stuff's been getting worse.

I have lost my ability to concentrate (as in, focusing is not only nearly impossible, but physically painful), and I'm now a few days behind on my school work (online MSW, really intense). I sometimes lock up and forget how to move/talk/breathe. The house is a mess, my fiancee is worried, and I think about hurting myself daily. I have a bruise on my leg from repeatedly punching myself. I break down and cry daily.

I talked to disability services so I can get accommodations, but they're being stubborn about it. I see my therapist on Friday, and I'm going to schedule an appointment with my psychiatrist, maybe get a scrip that'll help with the attention problems and hopefully not interact with anything else I'm taking.

I feel like I need to take time off and get some intensive care, but I can't drop out of school because student loans are my only source of income, and I can't work because of how bad things are. Finally, I'm transgender and have surgery coming up in a couple months, and I'm afraid that they will revoke my approval if they find out about my mental health problems (since they'll say that I'm too compromised to make my own decisions, which isn't true; I hate how aware I am of what's happening to me, despite my active logical processing being the only reason I'm not dead).

I guess I'm just feeling... lost. Like, I'm drifting towards a black hole, time around me is moving too fast, and I can't push away and escape. I'm consumed by a sense of dread and this awful, crushing weight. I was so close to getting things on the right track--medically and legally transition, start an internship, get married--and now I've lost all control.

29,"While I was finishing up with college, under my parent's urgency, I started seeing a therapist once a week for about a year.  At the time I had the wrong approach, since I basically was going in order to appease my parents and I didn't fully commit myself to self-improvement.  In my mind I was fine since I felt that I would start getting serious with my life ""soon"". 

Going into the meetings I thought that the therapist would guide me or teach me what I should be doing instead.  But it seemed like the therapist was just asking questions that I could be asking myself.  ""How does X make me feel?"" types of questions.  She wanted to know specifically what was going on in my dreams and what they made me feel.  Knowing that info didn't really seem like it would aid with helping my motivation.

Although I admit, immediately after leaving some of the sessions, I did have a feeling of confidence and a strong desire to get things done.  But this feeling went away usually by the next day or end of the same day as I would fall back to the same habits.  I quit seeing her after a year because I wasn't seeing much improvement and I figured I could figure it out on my own since I could just ask the same questions to myself.  I never felt like I got anywhere from her sessions.  

That was about ~5 years ago.  I finished college and am still stuck going sideways with no prospect of moving my life ahead.  Now I truly want to make a change and start seeing a therapist again.

I have recently been put on 20mg a day of fluoxetine. I started taking the dose on Sunday and the side effects are awful. Main ones are headache, tension around the jaw, nausea, werid rsuhes that cause me to have goosebumps all over my body and horrendous brain fog... my memory has been terrible! Also doing anything feels like a huge mountain to climb, getting up and showered this morning took 2 hours, yesterday I didnt get out of bed. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had similar side effects and how long they lasted for you?

Also, weird thing, I was on fluoxetine (same dose) about 4 years ago and never experienced side effects like this. My side effects before were really minimal, I felt fine after day 2/3 of taking them. But I guess our bodies and brains mechanisms change right?

So I've been taking it for 6 years now and its been really helpful, I've before taking those I would barely pass through school, failed one year in my 12th, went to another college and dropped out of it, and joined another college - basically, my life was a mess. 

I started taking these around my 2nd year in my 2nd college, and I could tell the difference immediately.  

So, now that the background is covered. This is where I am now, whenever I take the tablets, I am good life goes fine and everything is fine. The issue is when I don’t take my tablets. That is when I feel like I cannot function properly. 

I have spoken to my psychiatrist about it, and he said we could cut it down and see what happens. Whenever I did that, life didn’t go normal - It was just not simple. I’ve managed to stay without it for a maximum of 2 weeks, and those 2 weeks were probably the hardest time of my life, and had to come back up to my normal dosage. My psychiatrist says its not that huge a dosage so there is no issue with me taking it for a long period of time.

Now I am starting to think that I have become super depended on it events my psychiatrist tells me it's not an issue. This is probably because I don’t know anybody else who takes medications, or haven’t spoken to anybody else about it.

37,"So lately I have been questioning myself. Am I in danger zone for mental disorder? I have more specifically thought of the borderline personality disorder, anxiety, dangerous eating habits and manipulative daydreaming disorder.

I will tell little bit of my past.

I was born into family as an only child. One year later after my birth my Mom got pregnant again but it was canceled due to unknown reasons (I actually got to know his when I was 10 or 11 bc I always wanted a younger sibling and after this the topic has been really personal to my mom). 

I have bullied about my body image since I was 4 also I was born almost overweight so I am naturally chubby. I was a really happy and social kid when I was in kindergarten. I never stayed put. Also I usually moved on about the bulling bc there were my friends with me. But it actually affected me inside alot. 

So when the kindergarten was over I went to elementary school. But I guess I took the school as a really important thing and became really excited but also scared. In 1st grade I became more shy but I still talked alot and were a happy kid. But people didn't like me much and my cheery self fell. 

So by 2nd grade I didn't talked to anyone I was almost mute the whole time. But I got a new thing in my life: Daydreaming and it became part of my daily life (i am daydreaming to music and have triggers from movies, animes, music, kpop idols etc. and jump up and down on the floor while doing it. Talking to myself also goes with it. Sometimes it is even this much I will cry if something bad happens in my fantasies and make endless plots about my life stories). 

In 3rd grade I kind of became mean. I didn't bully anybody but I was pissed of all the time. 

So in 4th grade I finally got myself a friend in class. Also I think it was also around the time when my puberty hit me and I became anxious of my body. 

So in 5th grade I became frienemies with my ex enemy, one girl.(sorry enemy is kind if stupid word for it). But when summer came we became best friends. 

In 6th grade we were not speratable. We also kind of wanted to be alone together, so we had some problems with my first friend. It wasn't that we didn't like her we together had just stronger emotional connection. But the thing came of actually quite good. 

Also in 6th grade I became close with my old best friend from kindergarten bc we went both to same art school class. In art school everything was going fine. I got along nice with everyone. 

So here begins the sad part I guess. So last summer I had alot of mood swings, I avoided my friends, thought about how people were better off without me, searched alot on suicide, left my friend group and just stayed idle the whole summer doing nothing. I even don't remembered how it happened it feels like it's lasted forever. I only basically daydreamed and think shit about myself which is true. 

So start of this school year 7th grade I had mixed feelings with my class best friend. Also I went to physiologist bc of my extreme mood swings and suicidal thought (almost every weekend I cried disturbingly and saying there is no reason to live on like this). Actually physiologist helped me with my friend stuff and it got calm for a while. In October we couldn't stand each other mainly bc of my moodiness. It took us 2 months to talk to each other normally.  

Anyways now it's February but I still feel like shit. 2 months ago I had more anxious thoughts about my body and tried to throw up food multiple times. But I think it was more out of self hatered. Then one week I tried eating as an anorexic person would (sorry if it offended) but broke at the weekend and binged. 

And most of my days go like this that I eat first in the day at 2pm about intake of 200 calories about and then promise myself I will starve myself as much as I can and wouldn't binge but instead I will in the end do it and feel again like a failure bc in my achievements and personality I feel like a failure most of the time. 

Also I'm really irritable but in the end I feel like shit bc I make other people day a shit and it's all bc of my personality. Also sometimes I feel my classmates and art school classmates look down upon me and wouldn't care if I wasn't there anymore. 

With daydreaming it still goes strong and the old way only specific triggers have changed. It also has gone to the point it distracts my schoolwork and I spend lot of hours a day just daydreaming or being idle. 

Also sometimes I just feel I want to sleep like for two days straight bc I'm so tired emotionally. I sometimes imagine and dream that there is a white room with a white bed and sheets and I just lay there totally cut out of society. It will be nice...

So that's the story. Also if you answer or comment please be honest even when you think I'm a bitch or something.

I study in a really demanding engineering school and this is, I believe, the main reason I started feeling the way I do (due to pressure, professor retaliation, etc..).

I feel bad all the time, I don't have real reasons for how bad and sad I feel but I do. It is extremely hard getting up in the morning and I usually wake up thinking how worthless and useless I am. I have ""flash thoughts"" related to how worthless I am, about how I am a burden to others and about ending my life (and this one is the one that happens the most).

Being a christian has stopped me from hurting myself but the thoughts are there and I cannot stop them. I have this kind of thoughts at least 5 out of 7 days a week, if not every day.

I never looked for help because I never took this as a health problem, ""everyone feels sad"" I used to think. It was only this week when I had a fight with my girlfriend that I said something to someone (after the fight, while talking things out). She felt worried for me and wants me to look for help.

My concern is to find out this is not a disorder at all and that I'm just overreacting. I want to know if there is any kind of test I can preliminary  take to know if this is just a regular thing or if I actually should seek help...

I don't know what's actually wrong with me. I've had anxiety and depression for a while and struggle with codependent tendencies, though I think there's something else off in my brain. Sometimes I think NPD or BPD or bipolar, and sometimes I think a diagnosis doesn't matter because the end result is that I'm a jerk to those I love anyway.

Anyways. I am growing increasingly frustrated with my inability to change. As soon as I see progress, I start to regress. I've been to therapy. I've been on medication. I exercise. I've tried CBD. I've tried meditation and reading self-help articles on the internet. I'll rehash conversations in my head and try to figure out what the ""right"" way to respond would be versus how I actually responded so that, in theory, I'll do better next time. And yet I still hear myself say things that horrify me. It's like there are two people inside my brain-- the one who cares about other people, and the one who is a self-serving bitch. And no matter how hard I try to fight her, the self-serving bitch has the stronger voice.

I recognize that a lot of my problems are related to my situation (I am unhappy in my relationship, my living situation is not stable, my credit card and student loan debt mean I'm not financially independent in spite of working full time while I'm in grad school, and I've isolated myself from my friends and family to the point where most of them seem to want nothing to do with me). I feel trapped and I don't know how to change it. My situation exacerbates my mental health problems, and my mental health problems make it feel impossible to improve my situation. 

I don't want to kill myself, but I wish I didn't exist. ",14Feb2018,1

51,"So a lot of study and research has been conducted to find the reason behind certain mental health conditions. Nobody, not one bit of research, has concluded that its a chemical imbalance. Not one biomarker has been found to prove it has anything to do with chemicals. Research has shown time and time again it isnt a chemical imbalance. Why are doctors and people still spouting that it is and prescribing chemical altering medication based on the belief that it is a chemical imbalance? I just got absolutely shut down on another thread for suggesting that its not a chemical imbalance and downvoted to fuck. I wasnt belittling any one merely sharing information. When I have struggled with bouts of depression i have taken other steps that have had much better results without the use of any medication. If people wanted to change and not suffer shouldnt they be more open to other suggestions? ",14Feb2018,0

I'm staying on course, and I'll make corrections whenever necessary and try my best to stay on the right path.  I know I'm placating myself, trying to make myself feel better, but so what?

56,"Not sure what I'm looking for - affirmation? Sharing what I went through to support anyone else in a similar situation?

About me: I am emotional, a perfectionist, ambitious, organized, humorous, caring, somewhat narcissistic, and always, always thinking. 

I've experienced anxiety in the past - usually around a time of high stress - and have been able to shake it off. 

Earlier last year: finished graduate school, broke up with boyfriend to experience the single life, spent the summer partying hard, felt independent and freed of all responsibilities 

Stress level: 0/10 

Early fall last year: ex- re-enters picture, roommate moves out, I'm financially screwed (having spent most of my money over the summer), I start two new jobs, realize I have zero interest in following through with plans to do PhD 

Stress level: subconscious 7/10

I went out one night and drank a lot more than usual - I think I was subconsciously trying to drown all of the above. I woke up the next morning feeling really off - drank a huge cup of coffee - and had a major panic attack. 

After that - I had serious anxiety for several weeks. I blamed my ex- (we were trying to work things out at the time) and decided that I needed to end things with him for good.

Major concern: sometimes, when I get really anxious, I fear that I'm accidentally going to eat or drink something that's been contaminated with drugs. I am 110% aware that this is irrational, but I think I know where it comes from... When I smoked weed several years ago, I unexpectedly had a panic attack (had smoked weed in the past). I was super rattled by this experience and how I couldn't control or get out of it - I just needed to let it run its course. That feeling of being trapped in something I can't control is terrifying for me. So, I guess when I'm feeling anxious and out of control, I go back to that experience and fear it might happen again - even if it is super irrational. 

Possible source of feels: I found out around this time that my iron levels were in the super-anemic range. Once I started taking supplements, the brain-fog and racing heart symptoms I felt pretty frequently started to go away a bit - hooray!  

Mid fall last year: anxiety started to go away, took on a third job, started seeing someone new, started studying for law school admissions test, struggled to cover bills/debt (even with three jobs!), worked seven days a week, mourned the end of my relationship that I didn't really want to end - I realized I had pushed my ex- away because I was afraid that he was my anxiety trigger. I felt really stupid for not being able to juggle everything - I scolded myself for not being stronger, and isolated myself from close friend and family because I didn't want them to see me falling apart like I was.

Stress level: who knows 
Exhaustion level: 11/10

End fall last year: I quit one job to focus on the law exam. I sacrificed some financial security to do this, but didn't care at this point. I went to my parents' place just before the exam to visit. I find home to be mildly stressful for various reasons, but it's not often been a trigger for me. However, I experienced several panic attacks over the course of my visit - awful intense feelings of fear and dread that I had a hard time shaking. Felt so much better when I went to run errands or jumped into the bath with a book or watched a movie on my own - but when I had to socialize I just went full-blown fight-or-flight. 

Stress level: 11/10
Exhaustion level: 11/10 

I thought I was losing my mind - I was so freaked out. Hadn't I established that it was my low iron that had caused all that angst and irrational thinking earlier in the fall? How come this was happening now - after two months on supplements. I went back to that awful place where I was afraid of eating something contaminated. I was predominantly afraid of psychedelics this time around - I guess because they can trigger ""schizophrenic-like"" symptoms and I was absolutely terrified of losing control. 

I talked to my therapist and they said that what I was experiencing was ""not normal, but not abnormal"" - Um, what? I chewed on that statement for days. The one comfort I had was that my therapist wasn't rushing me off to the hospital or throwing prescriptions at me for medication - they just seemed to think I was hella stressed out. But, I'm stubborn and dramatic and couldn't accept that it was that simple.

Winter last year: I took the exam, signed a contract for a full-time job. Fixed things with my ex- Spent Christmas with my family and didn't have any panic attacks. I was painfully conscious of my thoughts and feelings and often on-edge but felt relatively comfortable, overall. 

Now: feeling 85% better. I still struggle trying to accept that things went sideways because I took on too much, that I was stressed and dealing with burnout. That's what my therapist seems to think. I'm working full-time, doing some extra-curricular stuff that I love, slowly mending my relationship with my man, opening up to friends and family about what was going on, and just trying to stay positive and not focus too much on fearing that that whole thing is going to happen again! 

So, for anyone out there who has experienced something similar - you are not alone!! It sucks, but I guess that's what happens in life - it can really drag you down sometimes and it's up to you to decide how you'll respond. It's much easier to say that than feel it myself, but I'm working on it. 

Much love.

58,"So ... I am a very anxious person, especially when it comes to things related to health. I'm always thinking that in the future the doctor will diagnose me some kind of serious illness, I'm almost sure of that, but right now go to the doctor isn't an option. 

The thing is that I have a boyfriend, he's an amazing guy and loves me A LOT and I know I love him as well, that's how he has become the most supportive person in my life when it comes to my panic attacks on being ill. Trust me: he really helps. Although I think he's awesome as a boyfriend and we both are good, surprisely I still don't feel 100% connected and confortable with the idea of us being in a relationship. We used to be friends for a long period of time, and before that I used to date girls only. As I say, I know I love him, but I don't know if I love him enough in a romantic way. Sadly I was thinking of breaking up the other day, but I'm afraid of loosing the only person that understand my health anxiety (and my anxiety in general) and know how to manage it. What do you think about my case? I'm very confused. ",14Feb2018,1
61,"Hi, i just found out about the term ""emotional deprivation disorder"" and it really resonates with me. when i was a baby i had a traumatic experience in which i was isolated for 2 weeks with not human contact. i think that this is the reason why i couldn't develope emotionally. i always asked myself why i don't feel emotions, why i don't feel love and connection to others. i always thought i am a bad person. could this be emotional deprivation disorder? ",14Feb2018,2
64,"So I have this problem where anything bad, regardless of how insignificant it may be, completely ruins my day and sometimes for even longer periods of time. For example, today I got involved in a near accident where the person who almost hit me threatened to beat my face in. After he pulled away, I just felt like shit even though I know it won't affect me any more because it's over. And it wasn't even that big of a deal! But I've been laying in bed ever since just thinking about it. This is just one of many examples. I don't know why any sort of conflict makes me feel so bad for so long. Does anyone know what this may be, or how to beat it?",14Feb2018,9
65,"Hi, first things first I'm not asking to be diagnosed and I'm not self-diagnosing anything if there is anything wrong but I'm a complete mess and need to vent right now. I have already been diagnosed with migraines but I'm starting to think the problems are something else.

For a while now my mood has been like a seesaw, I go from happy to depressed within hours and small things that would not bother other people and make my anger or nervous I'm an emotional mess. And I keep having these bad though in my head the worst kind but I'm pretty sure  I won't act on them. 

I have i couple friends but really one close as i always push people away it like i don't want to get attached to anyone. i don't know why i wrote this i will probably have go to the doctor if i want real answers",14Feb2018,1
66,"To put it simply, (preemptive TLDR) I want to ask: Can a person legitimately develop PTSD from a single event wherein their already-present anxiety problems (GAD, social anxiety, maybe some childhood trauma thing) are exacerbated by simply words?

A lot of what's mocked is people claiming to have PTSD from online bullying and harassment. I'm under no qualms that online harassment isn't a cause for such things, but I'm wondering about the extent of it.

I frequently find that, when something happens that upsets my anxiety (an unpleasant interaction online, some kind of social misstep out in public, an argument with a family member), anything I've interacted with around that time, for example a movie I watched or a food I ate, starts to bring it up again once the anxiety has calmed down. I know those examples of things that upset me are... tame, but I've always been sensitive, and I suppose there's probably some childhood event that could explain that. My anxiety is pretty bad.

Specific example now: I once spent a month in a panic attack because of a falling out with my dad, after which I fell into a deep depression and feared absolutely *everything* that crossed my path. I saw the movie Moana at the time, and I loved it, but now I can't talk about it or hear about it without feeling anxious and panicky again. (There are some other things that were affected, but Moana is the most apparently benevolent one.) 

Is this PTSD?

That event wasn't a small thing, mind you. My relationship with my father was ruined. Over time, it destroyed my relationship with one of my sisters as well. But it wasn't life-threatening, and I never feared for my physical well-being.

Something less understandable now. Just the other day, I found myself... well, I know it's an excuse, but I would say I was too tired to think entirely rationally, and I engaged someone on twitter who was *obviously* a bully. They mocked me to their followers, and... I didn't feel incredibly upset it. I wouldn't let myself. I had, for some reason, a goal in my mind: To get my point across. I won't go into details, because I really just don't want to, but only one of their followers ended up interacting with me, and I decided to give up and block them both before anyone said anything that actually bothered me. But it got into my head. The things that shouldn't have bothered me started swirling around in my mind, making me question a whole host of my convictions that were hardly even related. I lost sleep, and the next day, feeling better, I got into my re-reading of the Harry Potter series, because that's a thing I've been doing. Something in the book, though, reminded me of the interaction. It brought back all the thoughts I'd had about questioning myself. I fell into a hole I've found myself in before, contemplating the fruitlessness of certainty. I know it'll go away, as it always does, but I'm afraid I won't be able to enjoy Harry Potter anymore. I might even not be able to enjoy my favorite book series, which has a similar theme to the problem, and there's a passion project I've been working on that also has a similar theme that I'm terrified will be ruined for me.

All because of this one, brief, unimportant, non-dramatic event.

Before anyone suggests I talk to a psychiatrist: I am going to. I have an appointment already. Please don't waste a response with it.

I feel broken, I guess. This shouldn't happen. There are so many affirmations I have to calm myself down, but the discomfort never leaves. I can have no cares in-the-moment. I can avoid breaking down. I don't cry over silly little things like a child on the internet twisting my words. But I make connections in my head, and these connections bring me to a bad place from the smallest amount of discomfort. I'm too fragile.

Back to the question: Is this PTSD? Or is it just... general anxiety?

Edit: Thanks for the responses. It's a big help. ",14Feb2018,2
69,"It has always frustrated me to say the least. But just recently it struck me that it can be actually a real problem in my day to day life.

The other day I just played a new card game named The Wizard. Very fun and not at all that complex. But its system was new to me. My friend explained to me and another 2 people the basic rules before we started. And I tried my best to concentrate on them. But later on I still found myself struggling to remember the logic behind it, what I was supposed to do. I was feeling real slow and kept putting questions throughtout the game. My friends that were also new to this game grasped the dynamic of the game a lot faster and didn't seem as confused as I was. 

Eventually I got it. But I wad embarrassed by my slowness. This thing is happening to me in a lot of daily activities. I can't even enjoy the experience of a new video game with my peers without feeling like a total noob and helpless. I just feel like too many things are happening on the display and I can't grasp it all. This usually takes me a bit until I get used to it. 

But it frustrates me. I feel like an old person. Thinking slow, processing slow. It's affecting tremendously both my social and profesional lives. Not to mention my self-esteem.

Essentially, I am sick and tired of all of this ""get a haircut"" or ""smile more"" or bullshit like that. You know why? Because I've tried it, actually I've tried it plenty in the past but it's had absolutely zero fucking effect.

Firstly people always assume that I have a super Indian voice. [Here's a video of me speaking, no I don't.](https://youtu.be/SSqk7183r4g)

I'm also above average height, 6'1 last time I measured I think.

That being said there's a lot that I hate about my physical appearance;

1. You can see it from the side angle, I have a receding chin that sort of dents into my face inwards.

2. I have a big nose that makes me look really unattractive.

In addition to this I just have moles around my face.


Essentially my looks give me so little confidence that it is very difficult for me to socialize or meet new people, so I spend most of my life inside as a recluse.

Please don't recommend therapy. My parents don't let me see anyone outside of school because they think that if I see at therapist it's basically implying that they've failed as parents, they've said that themselves. And my school counselor is awful and totally ruined my life.

73,"He’s 25 and had moderate to severe depression for 11 years. 

I have a friend who got better by taking fish oil tablets with a 2:1 ratio of EPA and DHA (x2 daily).

He also incorporated daily gratitude, meditation, and everything in this program: https://tlc.ku.edu/elements

Here’s a good talk he heard that steered him in constructing his regimen: https://youtu.be/drv3BP0Fdi8

He found research meditation helps grow parts of the brain that shrink during depression and he incorporated it, he thinks the spillover of mindfulness in daily life has helped him regulate his thoughts better. He also found evidence that a good diet that supports gut health helps as most neurotransmitters are made in the gut but he hasn’t incorporated it into his routine yet.

He spoke to a doctor before starting (Omega-3s can thin blood so discuss before any supplementation). Omega-3s are slightly controversial so he did some research of overall health benefits and side effects as well before taking the plunge. Also he got his vitamin D levels checked along with any other nutritional deficiencies or potential health concerns (low iron, underactive thyroid) to eliminate other contributing factors during this process.

It took a month or two for him to see changes.

75,"Sorry if this is long rambling about my life story, but I just really need to get my story out there and off of my chest. 

I have completely missed out on life due to social anxiety and mental health issues. I'm still not completely sure what my problem is, but I know there's a huge chance I have some kind of mental illness because I've been suffering all of my life with paranoia, delusions, sometimes hallucinations,  anxiety, and constant panic attacks.  
I know no one here could diagnose me, I just wish it was easier to know for sure.
I was diagnosed as a kid with bipolar but I didn't get to say anything really since I was too scared to even talk and my mom just talked for me, and there was no brain evaluation or anything, they just gave me antidepressant meds which made me black out, sleepwalk, etc. and I had to stop taking them and just never went back to get any mental help. 
My whole family suffered with mental illness as well.
They were all diagnosed with either schizophrenia, OCD, or bipolar.  
My dad had schizophrenia and was an abusive drug addict. I never got to meet him or have a father figure because he killed himself thinking he'd come back as Jesus Christ. My mom ended up with severe depression after this, don't even know what she was doing during my childhood, I never got to have an actual conversation with her because she was barely ever home. When I did get to talk to her she was always drunk.
 Now she wants to be friends with me but I struggle talking to her at all.  
I was constantly being thrown between my mom's and grandparents house. In one I was being completely neglected, and in the other I was getting so spoiled that I couldn't see straight, to the point that it was actually neglect within itself. No one actually cared about teaching me how to be a decent human being.
I suffered from sexual (which I can't report in reasons I wont post here, its too personal.) physical, mental, emotional and verbal abuse (so basically all forms you can think of) from when I was just a kid up till last year when I FINALLY got the chance to move completely out of state with my boyfriend. I was being abused and neglected for my entire life. It's the only thing I can ever think about because it's the only thing I know.
I couldn't make friends at all, everyone just found me boring after like a week because I had nothing to ever talk about. Or that I was annoying and trying too hard, and talking just to talk. 
I got forced into isolation around middle school, when I got homeschooled after getting so stressed out I was throwing up at school, having panic attacks, and not being able to keep up with homework. I literally had homework from the very first of the year to almost the end of the year to catch up on and they had told me I was the worst student they'd ever had. 
 (Wasn't my first time being homeschooled, I'd been homeschooled in my earliest years starting preschool and kindergarten and because my siblings were also mentally ill and constantly caused a scene I couldnt get the education I needed, I was ignored for the most part because I was the quiet one.) 
My mom started taking me to a bs doctor who didn't even have a PHD, only studied in chiropractic work, and claimed that toxins in food and the environment were making me crazy or something. She convinced my mom that I had epilepsy, even though I've never had a seizure in my life, and I wasn't allowed to look at computer or tv screens anymore, so I couldnt do online school which would have helped me better, but I had no say in it at all.
 Once I turned 18 I started doing whatever I wanted and being able to use a computer again, and I made online friends that only stayed for a short time again once they realized how annoying I was to talk to.
I was already struggling to understand school, and so my mom became frustrated when she found out how stupid I actually am and stopped trying. So now I'm extremely uneducated and don't even know where to start, when I try learning anything I just completely start to forget it and its so unbelievably frustrating. 

Now I'm 20 years old and can't function normally. Everyone around me knows there's something wrong with me. People don't talk to me like I'm a human being, they just talk to me like they feel bad for me. I'm terrible at my job, I don't understand social cues at all, I don't understand when I'm making someone uncomfortable or not. People tell me I look sad/scared all the time without me even realizing it. I don't know how to fix it and It makes me so depressed that I have to act like it's my fault and just ""get over it"" until I can get some mental help. 

My boyfriend is the only person I have ever been able to open up to (without the internet I wouldn't even know him honestly), but he constantly tells me how I have the mind of a child, how boring I am, and how I have no personality whatsoever. I have nothing to talk about and I don't really HAVE any opinions because I haven't experienced much in life to have an actual opinion on. So basically I'm just dull and annoying and its pointless talking to me. 
I've tried really hard to get into the same stuff he likes and everything which has been a struggle, Im so depressed all the time its hard to like anything, but he knows that. He just wants to help me live a normal life I guess. 

I'm not sure if I ever will be normal though.

The truth is I don't even know what I'm doing or what I'm supposed to do and it's honestly so difficult. I don't want to be alive but I don't want to deal with pain from messing up trying to kill myself, Ive been trying SO hard to prevent myself from going through with it. I know my boyfriend cares too much also and it would break his heart, but sometimes his bluntness just puts me on edge. I don't want to make him feel like it was his fault or anything, I know he's trying so hard to help me. He has a good job and has been providing for me and he's so sweet and I appreciate everything he's done for me.
The last couple weeks thankfully I've been more motivated and happy, probably the happiest I've ever been, but I know it won't be for long and I dread having to deal with anxiety and depression all over again.





Tldr; Wish me luck in finding good mental help because my life has been in complete shambles since before I was even born lmao

77,"About 2 months ago I felt like I was on a rollercoaster of depression and anxiety. I'd never really felt depressed or anxious in the past. I tried to deny them and keep them subconscious. It was hard to accept.

I was lonely (after relocating for grad school) and because of this I was feeling a little depressed. I didn't know anyone, and when I was put in social situations I would begin to feel social anxious. How could I be the outgoing and social person I wanted to be when 90% of my time I was feeling depressed and lonely? When I tried to ""act"" more upbeat I felt self-conscious and anxious since I was being fake. I felt trapped. It was hard to make friends because of this, and the cycle just kept repeating.

There was one exception though, I had began dating someone, a girl who in many ways was like me. But it only lasted for a few weeks. Our relationship quickly ended due to my self-confidence issues and she began a relationship with one of my colleagues. They are still together. I felt like this was when I hit rock bottom.

With no one to turn to I ended up posting to this subreddit after that whole episode. I had so much going on and no one I could really talk to, it was very therapeutic to finally express how I had been feeling - even if it was to strangers online. Simply typing out my story helped me bring things to consciousness and help me see the situation for what it really was. Sad.

Over the next couple months I began focusing on my work, trying to be more positive, and working towards overall self improvement (exercise, diet, etc). After a couple weeks things started falling into place. I was doing well in school which gave me more confidence as people were turning towards me for help. - it gave me a sense of value. I was working out, eating well, and feeling happier overall. It sounds ridiculous but I honestly felt like I was radiating positivity which attracted people towards me. I wasn't lonely or anxious or depressed and it felt great.

The past month has been great, but there have been times when I began to question if I had really changed. The new positivity and confidence all seems so ethereal. It feels lying just beneath this is the depression and anxiety waiting to pounce. 

I  had already started noticing these feelings creeping up over the past few days and they hit pretty hard today. Everyone was sitting around talking about their Valentines day plans and I suddenly got feelings of anxiety rush over me as I was sitting there with no plans and nothing to say,  nothing I can say - I'm still kind of lonely. I suddenly begin to over-analyze everything in my own head. I think back to that girl I was dating and how it ended, which I'm still a little sad about. I feel like i've already lost a bit of the spark I had over the past month, and now i'm becoming a little more self-conscious and anxious by the day. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.

78,"Hello everyone, 
It's tough to admit but I have come to the realization that I am suffering from a mental issue that has stopped me from moving forward in my life. 


I am a student and the country I am living in has entrance tests to get admitted just about anywhere. So, I tried sitting in the test for engineering twice and failed both times. I ended up doing my engineering from a not so decent college.


After completing my engineering, I wanted to pursue a Masters degree. So, again I had to sit for a competitive exam for the same. 


I worked hard for this knowing that I had already failed in such exams before. 2 months before the exam I stopped giving my best, which was odd because upto that point, I was outperforming almost everyone in the Mock tests. 


Feelings of inadequacy surrounded me and made me feel like that this was not something I could do. I started feeling that I will never be able to clear such exams and I am just not good enough. One week before the exam, I gave up and did not even revise anything before going for the exam. Needless to say, I failed the exam.


The thing is, I am not a bad student. I used to outperform most of batch mates in college, but still, in this exam, surprisingly (to every one else who knew me at my college), I did not get through and most of these guys did. 


Even my teachers were surprised at this but I was not because I just could not see myself clearing such exams. 


After a few months, I decided to sit for another such exam and found the same pattern repeating itself during the preparation days. 


Now, I've realized that my failure to crack the pre-engineering test had scarred me mentally making me feel like a failure and I just cannot shake that feeling away and it is affecting my ability to clear such exams. 


I have another exam coming up next month and I really want to get in but I do not want the same pattern to repeat itself. 

What should I do? Any help would be appreciated.",14Feb2018,1

them. I am currently on 150mg effexor and 0.5mg resperidone. I asked my gp to give me 37.5 mg effexor and 0.25 mg resperidone. How many weeks should I take to reduce. Also my next set of meds I am choosing prozac and abilify are these okay?",14Feb2018,2
81,"I don't have a history with anything, other than overwork, and stress.
This past week, I've been going at my work none stop
I would wake up, work until I sleep. I have a project due, and a lot of things to get done, and I still don't feel like I manage to get anything done. As an example, yesterday I decided to take a break at 17:00, have a shower, and then study for my exam. 
Work suddenly piled, next thing I knew it was already 4am, and so I went to sleep. Today, the same thing happened, until I just shut off everything and told everyone to back off.
I feel like I should be working now, I want to work now. But I need to balance that with my exams. 
And then, someone who I love, excitedly showed me something that they need my help with. It will only take me couple of hours to do. And for some reason, I suddenly felt heavy heavy weight on my heart, I was speechless (which never happens to me), and when said felt I am uncomfortable and left, I somehow ended up crying. 
This is very odd, very very odd. ",14Feb2018,6
83,"When I talk with other people I basically go with the flow of the conversation and add in my 2 cents where I can. For some reason Im just not very engaged socially and I can't 'act' very excited/animated/dramatic. The conversations are not awkward just very superficial small-chat.

This has led me to have a lot of 'acquaintances' and few friends.",14Feb2018,3
84,"Hey everyone, I'm Patrick Vaillancourt also known was pbjvaillancourt on most social media platforms. I'm a Mental Health Advocate. I spend most of my time spreading awareness about MH, I document my journey so others can relate and feel less alone. All I wanted to know was that other people were going through something similar. 

That being said, I'd like to ask for your help. My Instagram is currently fully dedicated to MH videos. My youtube channel however is just catching up. What are some things you would like to see more of on youtube about mental health?
