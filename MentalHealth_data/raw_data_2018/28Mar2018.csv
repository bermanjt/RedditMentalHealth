0,"Before i start this is a throwaway account i'm very paranoid about people finding out about my mental health/other issues.Also if this is not the correct subreddit for this issue please tell me one i can go too.

Hello im 16 years old in the uk and i was diagnosed with what i thought was depression however after reading a form of my details(im not very good with names of serious stuff) i saw it said Manic Depression and was confused of what the difference is. 

After researching a little bit multiple websites said it was the old name of Bipolar disorder. This really confused me because a close family member suffers from bipolar and i after living with him/her (again i'm paranoid) i understand the symptoms really well so in my personal opinion i don't suffer from Bipolar Also a while ago i was prescribed Fluxitine(prozac) which to my knowlage is medication for Depression not bipolar ive also been told i do suffer from Depression from countless social workers/people this has been rolling around in my head for a while 

 I couldn't find anything online about this issue any information or tips on how to get said information would be Extremely useful and i would really appreciate any advice to my problem",28Mar2018,6,
1,"I have severe mood-swings. I'm impulsive, severely depressed, severely anxious. I can be over-emotional and then emotionally numb. I'm scared everyone will one day hate me and leave me. I have anger issues, suicidal thoughts. I think I'm nothing, I feel empty. I can be manipulative, I lie regularly. I am friends with people who treat me like crap and I'm in love with a girl who uses me to talk too when she's sad and forgets all about me when she's happy. My doctor won't diagnose me and I just want to know what's wrong.",28Mar2018,5,

3,"So, like in title. I basically sometimes see things (shapes, humanoid objects) in corner of my eye. The strongest effect occurs when it's dark and my imagination can go on full and start creating even some movement (moving shadow). Also, after smoking weed in darker places whole background can change, I can see more lively shadows and people faces can change when I'm not looking at them closely. Of course when I'm more tired or scared effect is a bit stronger.

To additon, when I'm looking at me in mirror and not focusing sight on my face, I can see it changes a bit (shape or facial gesture can be different). Few years ago, while being around 14 I keep doing this because it was quite interesting, but I stopped when It started getting creepy - then i needed to keep eye contact in mirror because i was frightened of it.

Also, what I noticed recently, sometimes random colorful dot can appear, or random somewhat light in darkness. It is really weird and it only last for a little moment. 

So yea, I'm writing this because im curious if this is normal and if anyone had anything similar.

5,"There are many times where I would think some things but think that they are bad. Like being jealous of someone, being possessive. I’m fully aware that these are bad, and I don’t like how I’m feeling these things. Like I would suddenly get jealous, but then I realize that none of these are right. Why am I even having these thoughts? I never acted on any of these thoughts because I’m aware that they are bad. But how am I even feeling these if I know that they are bad?

6,"Thanks to my morbid curiosity and being a woman who is into nursing plus psychology I've come across some types of people, such as the ''glitch in the Matrix'' people. I have been studying them for a few weeks and here is my assessment of their psyche;

**1.) Who and where are they?**

If you want to delve deeper into this circlejerk, there's an *entire subreddit* dedicated to these people (if this is just a troll subreddit *please* let me know!) /r/glitch_in_the_matrix

Example - https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/4mqg9f/he_teleported_and_i_saw_it_happen/

They can be found anywhere, but they tend to mingle in common congregation sites, such as the aforementioned subreddit.

**2.) What's the rundown?**

They believe that both psychologists and related authorial figures are *''agents of the Matrix'*' and *often report seeing physically impossible events* they call *''glitches in the Matrix'*' that they believe really happened, such as seeing people, buildings or vehicles literally pop out of existence right in front of them, seeing their friend teleport *(and other people seeing and reacting to it)*, time stopping in a busy shopping store, etc. There are others, such as dying and the day restarting from before they died, but the former options are the most common. These ''events'' are then used as their *''evidence''* that we live in a *''Matrix''*. Generally, these people have very similar speech patterns and typing patterns.

**3.) Why do they do it?**

They believe that the universe is just a videogame and that *other people are not real*. This is sparked or inspired by the 1999 science fiction blockbuster, entitled *''The Matrix''*.

**4.) What are their typical core behaviors and traits?**

*There's actually been many murders directly attributed to this condition*, for example a while ago I read about a man who killed his relative or friend because he believed he was living in the Matrix and the other person was just a video game character. I wish I was kidding. He wasn't an edgy teenage kid. The guy was in his thirties.

https://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligochampion/news/man-who-believed-he-was-in-the-matrix-kills-woman-35914218.html

What's scarier is this whole *''we live in the Matrix'*' and *''glitches in the Matrix''* thing has blown up in the last year or so, *and I have no idea why*. The proponents seem to be below average intellectually. For example when time stopped they didn't say they were forced forward due to the Earth's rotation stopping, or not being able to see for that matter. Also if someone vanished into thin air the air molecules would fill up the empty space so fast the blast would rupture eardrums. Yet none of this is ever reported in these *''glitches''*. Hmm.

Have any psychologists formally assessed or recognized this mental illness? Or is this merely a known mental illness taking another form, or 'evolving', so to speak? Some of these people speak in what is called a ''matter of factly'' manner that 'glitches' are just software bugs in the 'simulation' and not all programming is perfect. *They seem to lack social awareness* that most people do not believe what they do, but as if they expect everyone else to just 'know'.

95%~ (rough estimate) of them also believe that the sky is really just a *giant LCD screen*, that stars are just lights on said LCD screen, and the sun is a *''sun simulator''* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_t5vsXbokg. I can say that these people genuinely scare me and I wonder if they (assuming they're for real) pose a danger to themselves and/or others.

They also seem to get very upset, disproportionately so, whenever somebody makes even the slightest implication that they may need to seek psychiatric help. This became such a 'problem' that the glitch in the Matrix subreddit actually made an entire thread requesting people not to imply for them that they may be mentally ill, even going as far as dubbing them ''agents of the Matrix''. 

Their everyday lives, if their reporting is accurate, are probably nightmarish but at the same time it is awareness of mental disorders that opens up the pathway to *rehabilitating* them.

7,"I'm feeling a little in between about it. On one hand I'm glad my psychiatrist was able to have an actual diagnosis for me (rather than me saying ""I have anxiety and depression and something else that I don't know what it is""). On the other, she told me it will be a long road to ""recovery"", she couldn't say how long but she said it will be tough. 

All in all, I need to be weaned off of a medication that my PCP gave me that actually made everything worse for my mental health. My mind had something she defined as ""racing thoughts"" that seemed steady at first, but then started to get out of wack when I was put on anxiety medication. My brain went into almost a shock state where the thoughts stopped and it made it seem like the meds were helping. Then once the brain got used to the medication, the thoughts started again and progressively got worse. This then lead to an increase in medication, the brain was shocked and stopped the thoughts, and the medication was increased. This started a cycling of my brain with the racing thoughts going through phases of being so overwhelming that I felt like I was having thoughts that weren't mine (""voices"" as some call them). In reality, they were my own thoughts, just my brain not recognizing them based on how much was going on at the time. 

So for the next step, I need to be weaned off of the medication that began this cycling in the first place. Then I need to be put on a mood stabilizer to help these thoughts slow down so I can stop feeling so numbed by everything that is running through my brain.

11,"I have Borderline Disorder and I am heavily medicated and seeing my therapist 3 times per week.

I feel I am overly emotive and any behavior that I dislike from my family or friends I react badly and cry and get upset and tend to isolate myself so no one hurts me. Some of the very few friends that were left me just say ""she's sick, she's that way, she'll be okay and come back later"" but I feel awful for it and I think I'm so toxic I'd better isolate or kill myself (attempted many times).

I can't control my emotions and they are so strong, I don't know how to stop being this shitty person I am, I am out of control of myself, and this feels awful, I want to kill this thing taking control of me but it means killing me in the process too. 

I don't know where else to look for support....I've tried making throwaway accounts to talk about my relationships with people anonymously and without talking about my mental issues and I was bashed and called toxic and downvoted and called psycho and sick and disgusting .....I ended up with some very few mentally ill online friends who go through the same I do everyday and just accepted the fact I will probably be never able to have a real friend or a relationship because I am toxic...",28Mar2018,5,

16,"(F24)  My depression has taken over my life for almost as long as I can remember. This has made me (in my opinion) not a great friend. The depression got worse in the past few years and I stopped talking to my main group of friends who I had built a good relationship with. There were other reasons, but one of them was on me. I also don't actively work on new friend relationships. I have some old friends who I see on occasion and we are all okay with that. 

My question is, how do you apologize or make up with someone for not being there for them when they needed you to be? Or to apologize for simply not being there or trying to be for awhile? 

I am in therapy because I don't want this to be my life anymore. I want to grow and be better than I was before. I don't want to let the intimidation of the apologies stop me from living my life more peacefully. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading this too. ",28Mar2018,3,
17,"Hey guys! I've been under a lot of stress lately and some things have been happening to my mind that I'm unsure are because of severe stress/mental illness or if I'm just a bit daft. I was hoping there might be people here that could relate to any of these experiences? 

The other week I saw someone in town that I recognised and somehow knew that I knew them well. They said hello and called me by name, making small talk, but I couldn't remember a thing about them other than that I *should* know *lots* about them. After a few minutes they spoke to my mum who was with me, and it triggered me realising exactly who I was talking to. She is a lady I have known very well for years, I know her husband too and I've been to their house once or twice. I knew their names and everything about them, like a mental block had been lifted and it all of a sudden made sense. I don't have the best memory for faces and names, but it's never had such a severe consequence. Has my facial memory deteriorated so much or is it due to being under a huge amount of stress currently? 

Another thing I wanted to bring up is my emotional reaction to the stress. I have been keeping it together quite well, some days are worse than others. Yesterday I cried heavily for about an hour without *really* being sure of the reason. A few days ago my friend confessed she'd recently gotten out of the ICU after a near-fatal suicide attempt. I felt empathy for her and I'm supporting her, but I'm surprised at my lack of devastation. I came very close to losing a childhood friend, but the emotional impact feels close to 0. I felt physically on the verge of tears when I tried to tell a counselor about it, but at the same time I felt no negative emotions.  Am I dissociating from my emotions without realising? All that I can think is that I might be in survival mode right now. I can't let myself break down because so much is on the line, but if I don't deal with what I'm going through consciously I'm worried I'll sink into an unfeeling depression. 

Sorry for the word vomit. Please let me know if you've experienced anything like this before, and if you have any advice/support for me! 
Thank you 💖",28Mar2018,2,

I also don't have the urge to go out or interact with society, i've been at home for pretty much months since I started my gap year in October, and I've recently paid for a gym membership and have a part-time job of dog-sitting that I've attended to (taking care of dogs is the one thing that makes me still happy), but I literally can't bring myself to go out, and when I do it's only for less than an hour, I stay up until 2 in the morning watching YouTube videos and tv shows because I have nothing else to do, I wake up at 12 pm and eat instant noodles or some other easy food to make around 2-3 pm if I actually bother to go down to the kitchen to get my food, rinse and repeat.

25,"I am looking for some help and direction with my 35 year old brother. I very highly believe he has undiagnosed mental health issues but lives his life in complete isolation and does not believe in doctors or the medical system. We are in Canada and he has gone as far as unsubscribe himself from Canadian Medicare so that he is not part of ""the system"". He has not worked  or held a job for over 5 years now and has the opportunity to live in one of our fathers rental units free of charge. He does not collect any kind of welfare assistance as he has willingly removed himself because he doesn't want any record of being on any government records anywhere. When he needs money to eat, he will approach our father to do odds and end jobs at his company for a few days and then disappear for weeks on end. He spends all of his time in complete isolation and on his computer. Ive had very little contact with him in the past few years aside from seeing him briefly a few times or the many long drawn out emails he has sent me about him having discovered god/christ and asking me to become a follower or other messages that sound like conspiracy theories (trying to convince me  not to get a birth certificate for my son, living off grid is only way to live, you dont need to file income taxes, banks are evil, credit/mortgages are ungodly etc.) 
He has had issues with drugs in the past (meth, speed, alcohol) and has completed a few in patient programs. I dont have any reason to believe he is currently using. The issue is our father who lives in the same apartment complex is at his wits end. He feels like he is enabling and is in constant fear of finding out he is hurt or worse. It is not unusual for my brother to go weeks/months with no contact and with nobody seeing him ( a neighbour has told me he goes to a corner store late at night for food) but my father has told me he has not worked in over a month and he knows he has no money, I dont know how he actually eats. I live about 2 hours drive away and feel very lost as his younger sister because I don't know how to help.
We have tried various family interventions, talks, emails because he responds more online.  These seem to help somewhat for a brief period and then he goes back to his pattern of complete isolation. 
What are the best ways to entice him to seek help? I feel like he is a danger to himself, how do I proceed? Can I call 911 and explain the situation and force them to enter his apartment?

I have on multiple occasions manipulated women into doing what I want them to do for me sexually.

And my exact thought at that moment was how much pain the people who're suicidal feel, how worthless they feel when they hear the things I was told today. 

I can't fathom what emotions the people who are depressed and suicidal feel, and genuinely want to get helped  but can't because there's no one to support them and they don't have the financial aid to help themselves.


I myself have been suffering from depression since forever. I've never been diagnosed of it though. Because parents here don't believe in taking their kids to a therapist or psychiatrist to see if they suffer from any kind of mental disease. Also, I don't have the money to go to one but I would sell my kidney to afford to go to one. 

Last year when I couldn't take it anymore and I  threatened to commit suicide, I was told that a woman shouldn't get so angry and I was asked to sleep on it. When I asked my bitch of a cousin why no one tried to help me when I said I'd kill myself her response was- ""suicide is not something you should talk about to anyone and it's something we shouldn't be thinking of.""


I am not suicidal but the feeling of being trapped inside your own head is not a nice emotion. I just want some mental peace and help that anyone suffering from mental disease  deserves.

I've been trying and failing to type this out. The last year and a half I've gone from living with my abusive parents to living with other abusive people to finally living alone (I'm 19). I haven't been able to enjoy that though cause I have BPD, depression and PTSD.  
Most of the days I spend lying on the sofa contemplating suicide, I barely eat and I can't go out unless I absolutely have to (what still causes panic attacks and episodes). The latter allowed me to continue high school via a government study-at-home program thing where you can study alone and subscribe to exams throughout the year - every exam is actually 2 years of a subject in a normal school.  
Like I said, I'm absolutely useless so this hasn't been going well. I've been only following this study program thing since january, but if I don't pass in 4 subjects in july I'll be forced to find a full-time job.  
I don't trust myself lately, especially since my abusers have been trying to contact me (kind of ruining every progress I've made). I've been very unproductive and I don't know what else to do. I've even lost interest in my hobbies. I can't end up begging my abusers for help, so I've been considering taking meds (my psychologist suggested it) to improve my motivation. But still I worry it will make my situation worse somehow.  
  
If you've been in a similar situation, what is your advice? Did medication improve your life, and how? What are some prons and cons for you?

My name is James and I am from Manchester, England.


First of all I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm trying to help my Mum raise money for the charity Mind, it is an organisation that tries to help better the lives of those living with Mental Health Disorders, they are also actively trying to increase awareness about Mental Health.


My brother Gareth died on the 31st of March 2013, 5 years ago this March, my Mum and family have been broken by it since it happened as you would expect. Like I mentioned I'm trying to help my Mum raise money, she is quite upset that there hasn't been much money donated and feels quite down about it, feeling like she hasn't done enough to remember her son and has let him &amp; the charity down, this is not the case as any money raised  is amazing. 


My brother dealt with mental health issues since he was around 17 years old, until it finally got the better of him in 2013. There was no help, no support or awareness and he was completely shunned by the NHS. He suffered from Bipolar, Schizophrenia (severe paranoia that comes with it) and Anxiety. He was the best big brother I could have asked for, loved me unconditionally and I really want to help my Mum raise awareness and make her happy by helping her raise some money. My brother shouldn't have  had to deal with this with no professional help and charities like Mind are doing the best they can to help.  


Below is the just giving link, she's not very tech savvy and made the post without writing any description, her Facebook profile link will allow you to look for yourself and read what she has written. She is also auctioning off a near complete set of Compare the Market meerkats which she has been collecting for years for this fundraiser.


We are really struggling to get exposure to the cause and hence why I have came to Reddit to try and help with this.


Thank you all so much for reading and hopefully we can get a few people behind this to get it out to the wider Reddit community.

52,"I've already read the FAQ, and most of its suggestions don't really apply to my case. Let me give you guys some context:


Talking with my girlfriend who is already diagnosed for depression and currently medicated, she told me that the feelings I've described to her are very akin to those of early signs depression. She convinced me that instead of waiting for it to explode, to deal with it while it's only early signs, and I've chose to listen to her. That said...


I live in México, and the government *does* provides free counseling, the problem is the waitlist is eternal, two months average between sessions, and they're only half an hour long. They also prioritize patients in critical state. I am not in critical state yet or need any medication, I'd rather not get in the way of those who need truly it.


I've tried online counseling which is cheaper, but text based communication just doesn't cut it, and in my experience most counselors I've found online tend to be distant, or not as responsive as their webpages suggest.


What's the next best thing? Are there any good books out there? A cool YouTube channel or something among those lines? I don't mean to replace the work of a professional with a book, but something to help me hold on while I gather enough resources to pay for therapy.",28Mar2018,4,
53,"Since i was a teenager I would get like recent situations stuck in the background of my brain replaying kinda like when a song is stuck in your head, but i chopped this up to anxiety. But then about 9 months ago this changed to like the tones of voices playing in the background, usually it's a voice I heard recently like from a t.v show or something, this would also sometimes happen with images flashing in my head from a video/game. I can still think about other things and concentrate but it seemed to always be playing in the background.

I started coming up about the idea of being able to think about 2 things at once, layers of thought. I know you cannot actually consciously think about 2 things simultaneously, but what if you were only concentrating on one thing and the other is automated. You can do 2 things at once if you only need to attend to one. I play piano and juggle so i have experience in actual multitasking.

This all started happening 6 months before i started hallucinating, i really didn't think the voices getting stuck in my head was a sign of something bad. I haven't told my psych about the layers of thought bc I'm trying to dodge a schizophrenia diagnoses and the anti-psychotics have helped with the thoughts too. I don't think I have a question, just my strange ramblings.",28Mar2018,1,
54,"Recently, I've been getting very angry at the littlest things. My mom asked me a question the other day and I just yelled at her. When she asked me why I was so angry I just told her I don't even know. And it was true; most of the time I have no idea why. I'm also tired and unable to focus often.

When I'm in school, if somebody does something that annoys me, or just outright makes fun of me, I think about beating them up in the most brutal way possible, in a way that always draws a lot of blood. It can be anywhere from bashing their head into the desk to kicking them down entire flights of stairs until there aren't any stairs left. I could care less if this killed them. The worst part of this is that they aren't just thoughts and that I really, *really* want to do it.

Sometimes when I'm in public I have continuous intrusive thoughts about the building I'm in exploding or the person next to me leaping over and sinking a knife into my neck.

Then just last night I had a unique nightmare that I will never forget. There's a lot to the dream but I'll spare you the details and just tell you the horrifying part: My dad was driving with me in the car, and he starts crying because of something I said. He then crashes into a tunnel, everything goes black. Then I see the aftermath of the accident only I'm not part of the dream anymore, just a spectator. And there's blood EVERYWHERE. My dad is on the floor SCREAMING. Not just ""AHH!"" Yelling; Absolute demonic screaming that pierces your fucking soul and leaves no room for other sounds. Imagine the sound of a [deer yelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzwbOZKfrUQ), amplified greatly. I actually heard this in my head and it was really loud and felt so real. Then my dad starts wiggling around and jerking and jolting. The wreckage blocked the tunnel, so more cars keep coming in and crashing and crashing, and he screams louder.

I didn't used to be like this at all; I remember being happy, empathetic and friendly. For the past year though life has been pretty stressful but I'm not sure if this is just stress anymore. I have a therapist appointment in 2 months but I feel like it will be a lot worse by then. How do I make this stop?",28Mar2018,1,

Good to see a man in a traditionally masculine role embracing mental health issues. While I think we all get lots of cultural messages about stigmatizing mental health, I feel strongly that this is one area where men face an extra layer of complexity and scrutiny as they attempt to navigate their masculine identity and how it relates to the gendered expectations of both men and women in their lives. Particularly for cis, straight men, there is a lot of pressure from many cis straight women to conform to notions of traditional masculinity. This certainly comes from men too, but I think it’s an important reality to confront that both men and women have work to do. 

My one point of criticism is his claim that “everyone struggles with mental health at some point.” 

I’m not sure this is true. I accept that everyone is struggling with SOMETHING, and usually it is mental and invisible. Suffering is part of life. But that’s not the same as chronic mental health disorders. It’s important to distinguish chronic disorders from acute issues caused by life circumstances. Which isn’t to say they’re not real. It’s saying that failing to grieve an impactful loss is not the same as chronic depression, though they might manifest similarly in the short term. 

This distinction is important because there is a myth that depression is caused by life circumstances. For most depressed people, it exists in spite of life circumstances and many things to be thankful and appreciative for. Depression is a chronic disease, not a typical, appropriate emotion like grief. It’s like being temporarily in a wheelchair because you broke your leg, vs. being permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Both are equally as real, but have different scopes when treating them. 

But it’s being talked about. And that’s a positive step.",28Mar2018,3,

I'm in need of some serious and balanced advice please. This may be long..

Husband and I are due to go on holiday on Sunday with friends and their kids. We're supposed to be heading to theirs tomorrow or Friday then go from there..

Husband is currently signed off work with depression and stress, he's been off 1 week so far (signed off for 2) but yesterday and today he's home downhill. Anxious, worried about going out and being around people. He didn't leave the house today or get dressed.

65,"Hello everyone. I have been really distressed lately about a ""voice"" in my head that has been bullying and demeaning me fairly frequently. I have been diagnosed with Aspergers, GAD, clinical depression, and have been treated for bipolar disorder. My family has a history of schizophrenia and mental illnesses, but the ""voice"" that bullies me doesn't quite fit the description of a schizophrenic hallucination.

Rather than a hallucination that I hear, the voice manifests by speaking through my mouth, using my own vocal chords, almost like a tic. I couldn't find anyone online who has a similar condition and I don't understand what's going on. Sometimes when I feel the voice about to demean me, I'll shush it and sometimes it will respond with an insult. To outside observers it looks like I'm talking to myself. What could possibly be going on? I'm 21 years old and I hear that a lot of young men with schizophrenia start to slip up in their early twenties.

68,"I want to call a psychiatrist, but I'm scared that if I don't specifically ask to be tested for a particular illness then he'll say I'm fine and my life will continue to go on like this. I also feel like I will unconsciously pretend like I'm ok and he won't notice. I just feel very different from other people, and it's really hard to explain. It's hard to focus, I only feel happy when I'm alone, and I still rarely feel happy anyways. I go out of my way to avoid people. I have very dark existential, violent and even sexually violent thoughts all the time. I think everyone is conspiring against me. I think everyone is lying to me. I can't look people in the eye, and I even have trouble with simply talking. Every time I make a new friend I become emotionally unavailable within minutes. 
I feel like I'm a mixture of stupid, autistic and depressed, and maybe I'm all three. I've been to several therapists before, but never a psychiatrist. They want me to state what my problem is before coming in, but I honestly have no idea. I just know that I make other people feel uncomfortable, and I have no idea why I enjoy being alone so much.

71,"I have been in and out of therapy since I was eleven years old and diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, both moderate and recurring. I am 32 now, and I live in beautiful Washington state. I endured a number of years without treatment after aging out of my parent's insurance (prior to the ACA, their insurer only covered dependents until age 18, unless they were actively enrolled in college). My father's death in late 2012, and the guilt and grief that ensued, prompted me to return to therapy after a seven-year hiatus. Once I was back in treatment, I realized I should have taken steps to return much sooner, and jumped into my care plan with both feet, determined to get my life under control.

For a long time, I was covered under ""Obamacare"". I was seeing a therapist whom I felt really supported me, and who encouraged not only my mental health recovery, but my interest in mental health advocacy and peer counseling. I am a naturally stubborn,  resilient person, and this has worked in my favor when it comes to managing my depression and anxiety. Despite my diagnoses, and, even while enduring mental health crises, I have always had the wherewithal to know my limits, exercise the skills I have learned in therapy, get help when I need it, and maintain most of my obligations as an adult. I am extroverted, and ""high-functioning"". I was well on my way to recovery when my initial therapist went on family leave.

I was referred to another therapist in the same practice, whose support and clinical outlook were very similar to those of my previous clinician. My progress continued almost uninterrupted until the second therapist took a position elsewhere. By then, my original therapist had returned to work, so my files were transferred back, and my treatment smoothly transitioned. Then, my therapist abruptly resigned. I was called by the head of the practice a week before my next scheduled appointment, and placed with a third therapist, with whom I was marginally acquainted through a DBT support group.

Cue the awkward, ""getting-to-know-your-diagnosis-prognosis-and-care-plan"" process, once again. The third therapist and I were just starting to get comfortable with one another, when the practice announced it would no longer accept my insurance. The waiting lists at other clinics catering to low-income patients were months long; I couldn't get a referral, and, because I wasn't actively in crisis, I couldn't even obtain a medication referral for two full months. 

Without access to talk therapy or antidepressants, my condition degenerated to the point where I was admitted to the emergency department of a local hospital. My prescription was refilled by the hospital, but I was told I had to find a psychiatric prescriber to continue receiving antidepressants.

Immediately thereafter, I was told I no longer qualified for coverage through Medicaid because my income had increased...to $40 a month over the accepted parameters. I attempted to enroll in insurance through the market, but, finding it cost-prohibitive, I opted to pursue an insurance plan through my employer. I was told I would have to wait until open enrollment - four months away - before I could opt in, and that my coverage wouldn't take effect until January 1st of 2018.

I rationed my antidepressants. Once they were gone, I begged friends taking the same prescription for handouts. I even plumbed the friendly neighborhood drug dealer - I had to buy goddamned Zoloft off of the streets, because I made too much money to get Medicaid, but too little money to afford an uninsured appointment with my GP. Zoloft doesn't have shit for street value, so said dealer was reluctant to keep supplying it, and, for three months, I was unmedicated. 

I suffered from panic attacks every day, and became so depressed that my job performance was hindered. I kept my job, but was placed on disciplinary probation. My depression deepened, my interpersonal relationships and my romantic relationship suffered, and, were it not for my deeply supportive best friend, long-suffering boyfriend, and my own innate pigheadedness, I would have succumbed to the suicidal ideation that became my constant reality.

Open enrollment finally came, and, with it, a glimmer of hope. From the moment I finished filling out the requisite forms, I began to live day-by-day. A month and a half until coverage. A month until coverage. Two weeks until coverage. I gritted my teeth and suffered, confronting every panic attack, every suicidal thought, every morning where I was too depressed to roll out of bed, with the reminder that it was only so many weeks, days, hours, until I could get the help I needed.

January 1st finally arrived, and I researched therapists that accepted my insurance. I chose one. I made an appointment. January 31st was the soonest I could get in. So the process began again. Every day, I endured, to get to that appointment. Every hour. Every minute. I fought with everything in me, until, finally, the day of my intake arrived. I got to know the new therapist. He scheduled me for a second appointment, and an appointment with the practice's prescriber. A week until the second appointment. Three weeks until I met with the prescriber. Again, I was living my life by inches, terrified, yet determined. 

The day I got my prescription back, I cried. It felt like the pharmacist was the God I had never believed in, delivering me from my torment. The next week of re-adjustment numbness was absolute bliss. After half a year battling the overwhelming assault of my emotions, feeling nothing was euphoric. 

I am stable now. My therapist and I have been getting along splendidly, and he is shocked by my perseverence, and the rapidity of my improvement. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to last. My insurance, which previously told me I was fully covered, is now claiming I have reached my maximum, and will no longer provide coverage for my treatment. I found out yesterday that I am liable for $1,300 for my last two appointments, my provider referral, and today's appointment, for which I would have been charged anyway, given that I would not have been able to adhere to their cancellation policy.

I have no idea how I am going to pay this kind of money. Even a payment plan, at this point, is a crippling hit to my finances. What is more, I have no idea how I will be able to maintain my antidepressant prescription if my insurance won't even cover a GP appointment until next year. Thankfully, I have five refills between now and then, but I am terrified of the inevitable relapse when they run dry, and, as I am not yet comfortable enough to say I am in recovery, the loss of talk therapy appointments is a huge blow. I am at a complete loss as to how to proceed.

Suffice it to say that this is why I advocate for single-payer health care, and mental health awareness. Access to services is literally the difference between life and death, not only for myself, but for millions of other Americans with a mental health diagnosis, many of whom are lacking the therapeutic skills I have acquired over two decades, and the emotional support that I am fortunate enough to receive from my loved ones. 

I will continue to fight for my own recovery, but any advice and encouragement would be appreciated.

I feel like the pillars of my life have been either been crumbling or were never really developed to begin with and I've been falling for about 4-5 years now. 

I've taken some tests so I'll try to sum up some stuff for you. My Myers Briggs type is INTP-T, my OCEAN scores are at the bottom, and the Psych Central Autism / Asperger's Screening Quiz gave me a score of 20. 

I know that's a lot of numbers and letters that don't necessarily define me, and I am a human who's personality fluctuates, grows, and develops through time, but I hope it will be useful information for you. 

Now for why I am seeking help, I just don't know where my life is going and I feel trapped by my own inability to change. I never did well in school, failing multiple years and dropping out last year (senior year of high school) due to my mental health. 

The school had other mental health problems with other students committing suicide so my parents thought it would be best to allow me to leave and take a gap year. But it feels like nothing's changed since I left and I have only stagnated. That isn't the full truth because I continued my education at home using the internet because I love learning and exploring ideas. 

I'm not employed anymore, but I'm trying so hard to find something productive I can put my creativity toward because I feel like that's the only option for me. I have a small community of people I feel I can trust, I have a girlfriend of almost 2 years but that relationship is in question after what I feel was a long time of suppressing emotions on my part culminating in an incident last night that seemingly came out of nowhere for both of us. 

I just need help finding footing on my path. Nothing has been moving forward because I've had no defined goals for a long time and I've been drifting. But it needs to stop. Thank you for taking the time to read all this. I needed someone outside to help me be more honest and get this out. Have a nice day.

Now I am feeling better, and am probably as ready as I am ever going to be when it comes to going back to work and living my life. But I am terrified. I am so scared of going back to work and all this shit happening again. The pressure from my friends and family, who desperately want me to succeed because they love the shit out of me, then the guilt because I met people in the hospital who had NOBODY. I mean, absolutely no family, no friends, not a single phone number they could call. They were completely alone and here I am scared of my friends and family loving me? What the fuck is that?

Sorry, I am rambling. Point is, I am at the place where I think I have to go back to work and go back to living life like everyone else. But I honestly don’t know if I can...

I have no idea why I am posting here. Reddit has been a major source of anxiety for me because I kept getting into stupid arguments with alt right idiots...(it was a problem I had...a stupid attempt to try and take the power back from the people in my life...via nazis...dumb I know). But I cannot say this to any of my friends because honestly, I can’t upset them with this stuff.

Thanks for reading, sorry if I broke any posting rules...I couldn’t find the sidebar on my phone.",28Mar2018,2,
82,"Lately, I've been having thoughts -- almost as if I were disconnected. Like we all as people just operate in this ""system"" and in units, but not really feeling a part of it? Everyone goes through the same thing, getting a job, getting married, having kids, etc.

I had a nervous breakdown last June and I'm still recovering, and I had a lot of feelings of derealization/depersonalization, but sometimes I still think this way.

Anyone know what I'm talking about?",28Mar2018,2,
83,"Hey guys,

My girlfriend and I have talked a lot about how she often hears voices in her head and occasionally sees flashes of violence. She also says that if she tries to sleep in complete darkness she starts to see creatures in her room. This seemed like obvious signs of schizophrenia, however she doesn't seem to have any of the other symptoms. She seems to be thinking perfectly clearly, she doesn't have any disillusion (as far as I know), she knows that her hallucinations are not real and she doesn't interact with them physically (i.e. try to talk to them out loud). She is aware of her mental conditions and she is considering getting treatment for them.

She says that the voices are usually just annoying and she has learned to live with them, but sometimes they can be very convincing and try to get her to do bad things. She says that she has not let them make her do things that are too bad for several years, but I guess they told her to do something really bad a long time ago and she doesn't want to say what it was that she did.

How do I make sense of this? Is it actually schizophrenia? She seems perfectly lucid and grounded in reality except for the hallucinations. Could it have something to do with her autism? She has pretty severe Asperger's, but I've never known any form of autism to come with hallucinations. She was officially diagnosed with autism at 17 but many doctors considered her to be autistic as early as 12 years old and I'm pretty sure her hallucinations go back many years. This is also uncharacteristic of schizophrenia, as symptoms often start to show during early adulthood and not childhood.

Edit: She was diagnosed with schizophrenia a long time ago in a very non-clinical sense, but the reason why I'm asking is because I'm very skeptical of the diagnosis and it's likely that she was misdiagnosed because autism can share a lot of symptoms with schizophrenia.",28Mar2018,1,
84,"My friend is deeply depressed and uses “chemical imbalances” to explain why he feels like shit most days. He takes a bunch of supplements and uses logic like, “I take potassium to balance out my salt levels” or takes a shit ton (like pours powders in his water) of magnesium or zinc to “cure” his imbalances and feel better for short spurts of time. This short spurt only lasts a few hours before he spirals back into depression. He has never sought advice from any healthcare professionals (not sure if he has regular physicals but maybe he has before). 

I’ve tried to tell him that maybe it’s his mentality that is the issue and that receiving counseling might be the best treatment. He broke up with his ex a couple years ago and seems very hurt from it, works as a grocery store as a bagger and cart pusher, has a dirty room always, never does dishes (from meals that look like gruel), browsing on 4chan all the time, etc. He believes that his problems stem from his body and that he needs to solve the nutritional balances that he claims to have before he can get his life together. The problem is that he is seemingly healthy and won’t take his mentality into question, using the logic that this mainly stems from the “chemical imbalances”. How do I help this individual?

85,"I have a strong suspicion that I have schizoid personality disorder. I completely understand that it is never good to self-diagnose, and I'm not saying I definitely have this, but that I believe I might. 
Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I should do? Honestly, the last thing I want is to go talk to a therapist. I went when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but it would be very hard to force myself again. I suppose I would be more willing if I actually knew what was wrong with me, but I think it will always be a mystery. 
I don't want to go through all the symptoms and how they apply to me, but I will say that I am an extremely disconnected person, having been friendless since I was about 12. I have never felt attraction for another person, and this bothers me a lot. I was quite suicidal a few years ago, and I couldnt stop thinking about how inhuman I was. Never going to get married. Never going to have a family, or friends. I have massive collections of characters that I have created. With all the hours I spend working on them, you'd think I'm writing a book, but I'm not. I have hundreds of pages of documents with these characters and their storylines. When I love a song or a movie, it is not because I relate to it but because it matches one of my characters. I cannot make eye contact most of the time, even when speaking to my family. There are other things that bother me but I couldn't possibly write them all, so I'll stop here.
I guess I have a strong need to understand myself. I feel socially broken.
If you have any advice, it would be much appreciated. Thank you.",28Mar2018,1,
