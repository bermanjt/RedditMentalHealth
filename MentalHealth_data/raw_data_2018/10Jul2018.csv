0,"Background: I'm a transgender teenager with 2 eating disorders (ARFID and EDNOS), trying to recover from EDNOS. Diagnosed with both and also depression. No daddy issues, no negligence (only about ARFID), no traumatic experiences, except for the death of my best friend a few months ago due to anorexia nervosa complications, and a few suicide attempts (one of them lead me to the hospital, I got a NG tube down my throat, not very pleasant but still not traumatic).

So I couldn't admit that I want attention basically all the time for a very long time. I tried to label myself as borderline (very stupid thing to do, I know, and I am very sorry and regretful), but in the end I just didn't want to accept that I do want attention all the time. I'm coming to terms with it right now because it's starting to get obvious though it makes me very ashamed of myself.

When I say all the time, I mean literally all the time. I mean, yeah, there are a few rare moments that I just wanna be left alone (when I'm ungodly stressed while doing something, for example), but aside from those, it's very complicated.

I've had weird physical and emotional symptoms this whole afternoon because my 'boyfriend' wouldn't give me attention. I sometimes pretend that I'm upset or offended or stuff like that to get more attention, and even start fights. I freaking send nudes sometimes when I'm desperate for attention no matter what. I break promises for attention. I fake symptoms for attention. I throw tantrums for attention.

And I truly don't know what to do. I don't know why I am like this, and it bothers me very much. I can't be alone, and sometimes it feels like I don't even care about the people I claim to love, I just keep them because they give me attention.

Do you know what can it be? I really want help, and I'm very scared to talk to my parents about this whole situation or ask to talk to a therapist because it just feels so ridiculous. I wouldn't even write this post if I wasn't so desperate—and now I'm even thinking that I just made this whole thing to get your attention. Upvotes, comments, worry. I hate it that I feel like I need it so bad.

It's the first time that I speak up about it and I'm very nervous. 

tl;dr I'm addicted to attention to the point of damaging my relationships, I hate it, pls tell me what the heck is this",10Jul2018,1

2,"So, basically I’ve suffered with depression and anxiety on and off for a while and recently I’ve been hit hard with panic attacks.. but these don’t feel anything like what used to happen before. Before I start to actually panic I have a really zoned out moment where I feel like I’m not actually there or in the room but I am there at the same time. (Hard feeling to explain sorry!) Then I will have a full blown panic attack out of nowhere. I feel like it’s happening as I’ve recently just stopped taking medication as I want to self heal and find other ways to cope. If anyone could offer me any advice or have felt like this then I’d appreciate it as it’s a really weird feeling and I’m pretty confused. Thank you!! ",10Jul2018,2

5,"So I am 27 F. Recently within the past few months I have noticed an increase in symptoms of depression.
-A short fuse
-lack of patience/empathy
-crying all the time
-lost interest or pleasure in activities 
-no longer social with my friends
-no motivation to get out of bed
-excessive sleeping 
-weight gain
-overall I feel like I have no hope for life anymore. 

This is a complete 180 from my normal self. I was social, had a lot of friends and generally loved my life. I was more involved, rarely cried, etc. only things that have changed since this began occurring is a different job and new relationship. Both are positive changes. 

I have went to doctor for blood work and on the lower end of normal for iron B12 and Thyroid T3. I have been on supplements to correct them for 3 weeks and not much change. I have PCOS and started getting regular periods again so went to an obgyn to see if it’s hormonal and all they did was prescribe me birth control. 

I’m at a loss. I haven’t experienced this kind of depression in years. What can cause someone to go from bubbly happy to thinking of suicide in 6 months? There hasn’t been any big event or loss to bring this on. ",10Jul2018,1
6,"From suffering with severe depression and anxiety for 21 months, I’m am starting I wonder if this is it!

I seem to go from loving my husband to hating him! I can’t trust my own thoughts as I’m scared as sometimes I get things so badly wrong as I am unable to think rationally. 
Will it go back to the way it was or have I changed too much? 
The things that used to be so important to me have changed. I value the smallest things so much more! But then ultimately fills me with sadness and hate as I then remember my reality.

8,"yesterday I was at my boyfriend’s work and was saying bye to his boss when he replied with “bye doll, don’t kill yourself” before leaving. he left after this and I turned to my bf and asked him if he had just told me to not kill himself and he had actually said “bye doll, take care of yourself.” and then again I was overhearing my boyfriend and his friend talk because they were standing right outside our room and I wasn’t really paying attention until I heard “I couldn’t stop raping her”. I was literally so sure he had said this only to come to find out after asking my boyfriend that he had actually said “I couldn’t stop speaking”. 

I lack knowledge in mental health and I’m wondering if this is something I should be concerned about or is this just something that happens to everybody? the thing that is worrying me isn’t the mishearing, it’s what I’m hearing instead? 

I knew I always had at least some sort of minor anxiety but never seeked help for it and decided to self-medicate with weed, could this be from that or something? sometimes I have suicidal thoughts they come and go so maybe I’m subconsciously hearing suicidal/bad things?

9,"TL;DR: After weeks of letting anxiety stop me from exercising or determine how fair I could jog, I broke that limitation and felt a joy and peace I have not felt in a long time.

I have been dealing with severe anxiety for about 3 months, since I first started having chest pains. It's caused panic attacks, which I had never had before then, so I went to the hospital a few times. Even before then, for years, I haven't really been happy, and it's manifested itself in the forms of depression, anger, and anxiety, though I never realized how anxious a person I really was. I learned last week that I have minor scoliosis, which explains the pain, but for the majority of this 3 months, I have been very anxious about my heart and the possibility of heart attacks, despite a cardiologist clearing me as healthy with no restrictions, and multiple doctors basically laughing at me and telling me I'm 100&amp;#37; fine (quick note, I am 22M, not overweight at all, no medications, no realistic reason at all to be fearing for my heart health). I know now that I am fine, but I've had a lot of ""leftover"" anxiety, and it has been affecting my decision making for months, mainly in the sense that I'd avoid things that made me anxious. Specifically, things that raise my heart rate. This includes caffeine, marijuana, exercise, and even fast-paced or intense video games.

But I'm proud to announce that I went for a walk/jog today. I live in a rural area, so I have to walk on the side of the road, no sidewalks. The anxiety of raising my heart rate, being afraid of being out by myself if something happened to me, and even an irrational anxiety about drivers potentially running me over out of malevolence or malice has kept me from exercising like I want to and like I used to. The few times that I've managed to make myself do it, I'd always designate the traffic light, less than a mile from my home, as the stopping point, the place I turned around and headed back. I'd always be super nervous, and when I got home I'd feel like I'd accomplished nothing. Going to that traffic light and back always felt like such a hollow victory.

I was moving along, listening to a podcast called The Art of Manliness, and the topic was about anxiety, and the guest speaker was from an anxiety treatment clinic in Portland. I highly recommend The Art of Manliness, btw, great stuff. The speaker was talking about one of their most successful treatments for anxiety was exposure therapy, where they would expose the patient to one of their anxiety triggers for about 6 hours, and their fight-or-flight would be kicking in hard, but they would just tolerate it, until finally they got relatively comfortable and realized there was no real danger.

Well, I was hating the jog up until this point, anxious for my heart and overall health, looking forward to hitting my self-imposed traffic light boundary and turning back. But it hit me that even though I was jogging in spite of my anxiety, I was still letting it make decisions for me. Namely, it was my anxiety making me turn around at the traffic light, too afraid to get farther from home. In the spirit of exposure therapy, I went past the traffic light.

I was scared at first, but it also felt liberating. I started laughing, and crying, both at the same time. And even though I had not yet finished the jog, I felt more victorious passing the traffic light than I had any other time I'd gone for a jog. I was only half jogging, more like speed-walking, but I felt like I had accomplished something real. I had broken a milestone, I had broken the limitation I let anxiety impose on me. My heart rate was around 150 bpm, and I was okay. I wasn't dying, I didn't feel like I was in danger, my fight-or-flight wasn't going haywire. I was actually enjoying myself. I could pay attention to the podcast, and everything they were saying about anxiety made me feel more liberated and more proud of what I was doing, to the point I didn't even want to turn around and go back home. I just wanted to keep going, and going, and going. I looked at the birds flying, and the rabbits darting off into the tall grass, listened to the sound of the highway in the distance, looked at the pink and white blossoms on the trees, felt the breeze on my face and smelled the fragrance of fresh air, and it was all so beautiful, these things I could not appreciate and were blind to before. I even waved at every single car that passed me, and almost every single one of them waved back. And at random moments I would just start half laughing and half crying, it was a really cathartic experience.

When I got back home, I felt really good. Mentally and physically. I stretched a little, took a shower, and came upstairs to the computer to share this with you. And even though this outing was really the only thing I've done today, I feel like I've done so much. I feel very satisfied with today, and really look forward to being able to do the same tomorrow.

To anyone else letting anxiety impose limits on you, it gets better. You just have to realize what things in your life you are letting it control. Whenever you make a decision, you ask yourself, ""Am I making this decision because it's what \*I\* want, or am I letting fear and anxiety decide for me?"" And if it's the fear talking, you can't feed that, you have to starve it. Your brain is hardwired to protect you, and when you do the things you are afraid of over and over and over, it picks up on that and realizes it's nothing to be afraid of. It just takes a little time, but the freedom can taste so sweet.",10Jul2018,4
10,"Hello.

I am writing to ask how you deal with the destructive contradictions and disconnects that can happen when you're in a certain mindset. Specifically, how do you reconcile the fact that you know that being in certain states of mind (e.g. depression) can involve such beliefs as feeling like a burden with the overwhelming feeling that you are indeed as much of a waste and as loathed as you think you are?

And one of the self-fulfilling parts of this involves not being able to trust anyone that suggests otherwise. You can have family members and friends alike tell you with overwhelming affect in their voice and expression that what you think about yourself and how others think about you is not true. And that makes it worse. Because you can't trust them. You think about how you lie all the time, so it makes sense that people would lie around you in order to not be rude or out of pity or to get something from you. So you just wait to get that one text you shouldn't have gotten or hear that one conversation you shouldn't have heard in which those closest to you spell out how much of a worthless, disgusting, pathetic parasite you are, for them to confirm everything you think about yourself and how you think they think about you. And even more than, even when they try that same predictable response to your repeated cycles of self-pitying and overall uselessness and worthlessness in action, you know they are wasting their time. You know you won't accept anything positive they say. You are actively making them waste their time. You really are burdening them. You really are leeching off of them, even when they have their own problems (and maybe even mental problems) going on.

I'm still not in danger, but tonight is another night in which I ruminate on leaving my bank information on my roommate's table so he can pay to move out while I make sure I no longer have to deal with myself nor leech off of others ever again. I hate that I am doing this to him. I doubt pretty much everything I think, say, and do, but it always feels like I can read the hesitation and burdening from me in his voice whenever he tries to validate or reassure me. He already has problems, I am making him worse, I'm not going to change. I fucking hate myself.

I really didn't expect my writing to go this route, to be honest. I'm kind of torn here because I am half-looking for validation or reassurance still, but as I wrote above, it would just make me feel worse. So, instead, do you deal with this, too? How do you try to manage it? Any advice/tips (aside from the generic ""seek therapy/medication"")? Anecdotes?

I sincerely mean it when I say thank you for reading this. Even if you don't have much to say, I know this sounds pathetic, but could you at least write anything or give some indication that this was actually viewed by someone else? I know I can't be alone in this, and any evidence to show that would hopefully be helpful to myself and others.",10Jul2018,1

16,"First, allow me to introduce myself.

I'm a 19 year old male who was diagnosed (at an early age) of being on the autism spectrum, albeit at a high-functioning position. When I was young (up until' the time puberty hit, 12 or 13), I was prone to emotional and sometimes physical outbursts. At the age of 10, I shoved my then-babysitter but that was a one-time incident and she's gone now for different reasons I'd rather not get into. Otherwise, I never laid my hands on anyone else but had threatened to it. Again, this was more than a decade ago.

It seemed like as soon as I approached my adolescent years, the tides began to drastically turn as I acquired more and more life experience and dove head-first into puberty without even realizing the changes that were going on. Things were smooth sailing until' I switched high schools halfway through. I felt like my first high-school was too easy and coddled me to death, I wanted an actual high-school experience that didn't shelter me like a fucking child.

So I transfer high schools. My new high school was a 15-minute drive away, I had to be personally driven by a family friend who lived with us at the time. Let me tell you right now, this was a complete 180-degree turn. My second high school was a prestigious HS that specialized in ROTC training, held over 3000 students from all over the world and housed three floors. There was no room for ""community"", no room for making new friends and if you did, you wouldn't see them the next year or even semester. 

So, I grew distant throughout my junior and senior years. Without close long-term friends, I had nobody to reach out to. I began to space out and harbor animosity towards the world. I would begin identifying with movie villains, psychopathic anti-heroes and actual violent criminals. During this time, I didn't feel any emotions but anger and disgust. Sadness and compassion weren't in the cards for me. I would fantasize about violently lashing out, but luckily never actually got around to acting on my raging desires. During this time, I had a brief relationship with a troubled Junior (let's call her Em) and even she began to realize that something was amiss with me. That's why we only dated for a month.

Flash forward to freshman year of college. Relatively smooth sailing, but not perfect. I briefly held a job working in shipping at a neighborhood Lowe's, and now work part-time at my folks' auto parts store. Over the past year or so, the dark fantasies have been slowly eroding to the point where they're hardly fantasies at all. And this brings us to today. 

I woke up this morning from a nightmarish dreary, it was cold and dark and damp, the household was awash with loneliness. I wake up, tearing up. This is probably the third time my eyes have watered in the past five years. I began to sympathize with deceased strangers more and more, my heart aches now more than ever, I have gone soft in my (relatively) young age and it wasn't this way a few short months ago. I can't identify this sudden transformation from a cold-hearted, aggressive misanthrope to a kind and stable soul. But maybe somebody here can? Without ridiculing me or bashing me or trying to push me into the abyss again.",10Jul2018,1

I have one friend, no group of my own, no ""tribe"". I'm tired of my emotional ups and downs keeping me from finding a group of friends, getting a degree, maintaining a job. I'm tired of being a short little Hobbit, tired of constantly fighting my weight. I'm tired of my skin being the worst it's ever been in my life.

18,"Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post or not. I'm feeling sort of lost right now.

My younger brother (22) has been exhibiting what I'm pretty sure are signs of schizophrenia. It started probably about a year ago; I took him out for lunch, and he started getting incredibly angry about people ""looking at him."" No one was, at least until he started making a scene. The intense paranoia really struck me. I don't live with him or see him often, so while it unsettled me, I put it down to him being a bit tipsy and handling it badly. I was able to calm him down, and we went on with the day.

He currently lives at home with my mom, and she called me tonight. She explained that he came home drunk, and was acting weird. At one point he was in the basement, and came up to the main level muttering to himself. When asked what was going on, he responded that ""they"" had told him to go upstairs. When asked who ""they"" were (he had been alone) he said not to worry about it, that my mom/siblings were safe. 

He's been into cocaine, pot, and I suspect many others for a while. My mom asked if he could be on a drug making him like this and while it's possible, I suspect it's something more. 

We're in Alberta, Canada. My mom's low income, and we're all lost as to what we can do to help him, short of having him put into an involuntary psych evaluation.

Details:

* **(No, I can't see a local professional in this country because its mandatory for them to warn the police about any possibilities of violence and the police here is pure military retardad.)**
* Anyways, I'm 23 male, from portuguese family, raised in Brazil. I'm assexual and getting in to budhism. If any of this helps understand my personality.
* I discovered myself as assexual last year which makes this a bigger confusion for me. I have no desire of any kind whatsoever. I mean, if a girl wants to do it and the situation is boring, I'll do it and I kind of like it, but like a kind of dance/exercise with a bit of intimacy, but I don't feel anything before or after(it won\`t even get up before I\`m fully aware that i\`m going to ""get laid"").

What:

* Recently, I observed myself more confortable around kids, i have no clue why, since we only have one kid(cousin, 12) in the family, and besides taking care of him some nights, I'm not really that close.
* Its nothing sexual, I guess, as I'm ace. The feeling I get is more like that one that we feel with cute babes on the ""desire"" to bite their cute little feet, i don't know. But its all the time, I find every kid cute, I rather talk to them and see their vision of the world than to talk to any of my (few) friends.
* One moment a while ago that made me realize that is when I got to a ""lan house"", kind of a coffee shop dedicated to gamers, I was there just to print some stuffs because my printer was broken, but as I used to play there, I looked around, saw some old game partners(they're now in their 30's still there) and them while using one of the pc's I realized myself very confortable surounded by screaming kids in their socks with snacks all over the place. Is that a common thing? Am I becoming any kind of weirdo?

w t f is wrong with me? I don't think its sexual, but WHAT IS GOING ON? Should I file for chemical castration before it gets weird? I could do that, I don't really mind for the act in anyway, should I take that precaution? Any pros on psychology willing to give free advice?

27,"My fiance and her son have been living with my daughter and I for approximately 2 years.  Her son had a lot of problems in his teens... drug and alcohol abuse, etc.  He cleaned his act up, got a job where we work and has been doing fairly well compared to how he was... but here's the thing.  He obsesses and does not deal with life well... not that he's even remotely experienced the problems that the real world can and will throw at him.  A year ago he had a girlfriend that dumped him and he kept missing work and nearly lost his job.  He pulled himself out if it and had to go an entire year without getting a point to keep his job and he did it while working a ton of overtime because he wanted an import racecar.  He obsessed over this car, bought it and then had it suped up... $50,000 later it's how he wants it.  He put all of his money in to it and still owes on it, plus a new dirt bike, high insurance and phone payment.  He now has met a new girl and the car does not seem as important to him.  He's obsessed with this girl and now wants to quit his job.  A few weeks ago he was talking about working and saving for college, an actual A to B car and seemed to have his life planned out.  It always changes.  I've seen him obsess over cars, bikes, girls (not all but he'll eventually get dead set on one), etc.  He cannot deal with things not working out with a girl and go into complete meltdown mode.  He cannot make good choices and gets completely controlled by his emotions.  His plans change all of the time.  If he tried to make it on his own right now it would be a disaster... I wouldn't put it past him to be suicidal in the face of real life problems.  I can't imagine him being able to handle a divorce or break up of a family.  He is a nice and respectful kid who everyone likes.  People outside our home don't knows of his issues.  We try to point him in the right direction but he ends up making horrible impulse decisions.  I know the word ""spoiled"" and "" ""enabled"" probably comes to your minds when reading this, but it goes much deeper.  Any ideas to what is wrong with him?",10Jul2018,0
28,"I'm 15 Years old;
So I got this pill known as Abilify or Apriperzole or something. 
I take 4 MG a night. I don't want to take the damn pills anymore. I feel it's only temporarily fixing my issue here and that I should learn how to cope on my own. 

But every time I stop taking the pills, I get frustrated, agitated, angry, I show depression symptoms, I think about who's done me wrong and I think about my past a lot AKA Trauma, I feel Hopeless in my situation, I'm Doubtful for my success, I get anxiety, and so on. 

My family like to harass me to take my pills or go to the hospital and they threaten to call the cops, it only makes things worse. I've also realized that even with the Abilify and without, I still have trouble in school. I can't concentrate, I'm not learning anything, I get anxiety when I need help on a math problem in class but I never ask.

My family doesn't make it any easier when they lecture me to go to school or take my medicine (I don't believe it works either because I still had mood swings.) I want to go to school in all but I just don't see the point of the fight. I've been trying to get on track for the past several years now, and I am just confused on why I'm like this. 

If anyone's been in my shoes, and has an answer please don't hesitate to share it with me. I need relief from all this pain I'm going through.

29,"im writing to see if anyone knows the starting symptoms of mental illnesses (bipolar and schizophrenia are on my mind) because i feel like recently i’ve been having strange occurrences in my head as a result of smoking so much weed , a few nights of drinking , cocaine , and the excess emotion left from my first ever break up a few months ago (first girl i’ve thought i loved broke up with me after about 15 months, for context).
After the break up i started smoking more often and one day after school me and my friends smoked some ‘Ghost Train’ sativa and long story short i felt like this bird was tweeting inside of my head , as if this birds screech was happening inside of my head rather than an external noise (its like i had a hard time differentiating).I began to cry and feel scared because i thought i was having a mental breakdown.
I’ve also experienced depersonalisation a few times where i feel like i’m simply spectating through my eyes , watching everyone like they were strangers bc i feel as if i don’t know necessarily who i am
Most recently i had smoked and suddenly my thoughts became clamour , it was like my one conscience became a ensemble of different and randomly generated personalities and people , each voice saying something different sporadically.My thoughts were on loop and it became hard to focus on one thing because it was like everything i was saying to myself was being read through a loudspeaker and repeated.i could hear phrases like ‘kill yourself’ and ‘youre not worth it’ in my head as if my conscience was telling me to but it was coming to me in the form of different voices (not external voices that i struggled to tell were fake/real but more voices in my conscience(brain) that i knew weren’t real but was stillconfused as to why my thoughts were so loud)
Additionally are these thoughts that i’m not sure are delusions as suddenly i feel resentment to my ex girlfriend and have these passing thoughts of her lying about loving me/cheating on me/having feelings for other people.I feel like this is delusional because it’s only here and there i have these moments but when they occur they’re the most believable thing in the world and suddenly i find myself telling myself to hate her and not trust anybody.
Im 16 years old and have experienced depression and used self harm as a coping mechanism for that however it’s been a while since i’ve found myself feeling like i would last year.Ive always talked to myself and felt like i had a rather strong mind (with how vividly i picture and remember things) and so i was just wondering if these symptoms sound familiar/if i should be scared

31,"I’ve shown almost all signs of psychopathy. Lack of remorse and guilt, manipulation, lack of feeling. I enjoy manipulation. I also enjoy watching people, and thinking about why they do certain thinks, how they can really believe stupid shit, I mean truly believe in what they are doing. It’s annoying, but funny if I’m in a good mood. I’m brutally honest. I’m 15. My dad was an abusive crybaby, and I used to be scared to be around him. He gave me constant anxiety the older I got. I don’t care now, his existence is just an annoyance to me. He’s in jail now for god knows what, my life is better without him. I follow somewhat in his steps. Teenage drug use, anger issues. I do feel things though. I’m in love with a girl, and have been for the past four years. I like my friends, but also keep my circle small. I don’t feel much for my family. I don’t enjoy talking to them about feelings, stupid things. I don’t care too much what happens to them (older sister who’s usually away at college and my mom) I’m not sure what I should do with my psychopathy. I know I could probably use it to my advantage, though in the past I’ve used to to destroy people’s ideas of me, burn bridges, break hearts and destroy a false hope of what they think is love, I’ve disappointed people. I also have problems with anxiety that I wish I didn’t. Past problems with depression and suicidal feelings. I can’t say I don’t have depression anymore, but I’m not sad. I’ve used a lot of drugs. Diphenhydramine was one of my favorites and I’ve used it too much. (I mostly just smoke though) I can feel my mental quivering though. I see things moving out of the corner of my eye, every once in a while I hear voices or knocks, things that are normal on dph, but why I’m experiencing these things sober, I may just be losing my mind.

I'm absolutely terrified of the thought of working with strangers, my anxiety is the worst it's ever been, but it needs to be done, I guess. I'm not going to bother even attempting to claim PIP (disability) because they're denying people with cancer PIP, so what hope do we mental health sufferers have?

But what's annoying is that I've applied for dozens of jobs over the course of the last 4 weeks and I've not heard back from a single one. Not even saying that my application wasn't successful. For someone like me, with so much angst and self-esteem problems, this silence is killing me. My brain jumps to irrational places of ""maybe I'm so bad they don't want to reply to me"". This hits my self-esteem and fuels some intense spells of depression. Everyone around me gets lucky breaks with jobs, people with grades far inferior to mine, experience far inferior. I have an almost perfect CV for customer assistant jobs, but I am still being left in the dark. 

For mental health sufferers, applying for jobs, let alone actually working them, is hell and governments need to realise this.",10Jul2018,1
34,"Hello!
Recently I’ve been having I guess you could say an “episode” of unbelievable anxiety. For about 8 or 9 days I haven’t been sleeping well, been anxious throughout the day, and just feel very impaired. The anxiety worsens significantly after about 7:30pm each day.
I have returned to therapy, and saw my doctor yesterday. He prescribed me Ativan to take need-only in the evening before bed to help me sleep and stop me from having the meltdowns I’ve had every few nights.
Last night I took Ativan for the first time, cutting a 1mg tablet in half. I was very nervous before taking it, and also nervous while waiting for it to kick in.
For three full hours my anxiety was heightened unbelievably, I was scared, paranoid, twitching, shaking, and very restless, but still felt heavy and sedated. But I could not come close to sleep until I essentially passed out around 2 am on my couch. I was scared that I may need to be hospitalized. I was wishing I could just vomit it out.
I texted my doctor about it but I haven’t heard back from him yet. 
Did I do something wrong? Or is Ativan just not for me?",10Jul2018,1
35,"My apologies for the length of this.
Someone I met a couple of years ago through my job has a very bad past. Or so they say. Due  to how much of a model employee they are, I've never had any reason to doubt what they say about anything. 
They told me their spouse and 2 children died in a car accident years ago. All photos were lost during an overseas move. They later married the spouse's best friend. But the new spouse works overseas and is very rich. I've never met anyone from this family. Just the person from work.
Recently they told me some photos had been found and they showed me over a catch up dinner we had. I thought the photos of the deceased spouse and one child showed an EXTREMELY good looking man and these apparently candid pictures looked very posed and one looked like a paparazzi shot. I thanked them for showing me but it hit me that there are things that don't add up.
As soon as I got home I typed into google all the details I could remember of the paparazzi style shot. BOOM! It was a photo of Cam Gigandet of Twilight fame. 
Now I don't know where the lies begin or end. Is the back story real and they are so desperate for something that they believe the photos are of their lost love?
Is everything they have told me made up? Are they a compulsive liar? Or do they believe it's real and they have a mental illness? If so, how do I help? Are they actually just extremely lonely? I have asked myself these questions for the last few days. It has kept me up for several nights.
What would you do? I don't want to assume liar if it's a genuine mental illness. I would like to help if I can. But I'm scared to directly say something in case the reaction is bad as I only see them when I'm alone with them.",10Jul2018,2

37,"I'm 21yo student and I think I have a lot of problems in my head, but it's so hard for me to find out what it is, I feel like I don't remember my feelings well and can't describe them well enough. Also every time I feel better I feel kinda embarrassed and dismiss all of my problems but then they come back and I can't just ignore it. It's even more complicated because I have this lung infection and it makes me very tired all day and makes my whole body hurt. I was on antibiotics for 4 weeks but it didn't go away and nobody wanted to believe me I really feel like that. Now I'm waiting for blood test result, but it's taking.

  
Anyway there are some things I managed to observe. I hate talking to strangers, I never start conversations with them on my own. For example when I'm at my dorm and there's someone in the kitchen or in the hallway I usually wait in my room until they go away. Even when I'm with people I usually don't talk much, I just can't think of anything to say. This happens especially when I'm with people that I think are cool and I look up to. I mostly just wonder why are they even talking to someone like me. I can't share anything on social media unlike my friends, because I always delete it a few days latter when I realize how awkward it is. I love making music and sometimes I just feel like I'd like to put it somewhere on the internet and share it with other people, but then I always start thinking about how awkward and embarrassing it would be and just dismiss it. I'd give anything to be an extrovert and to be able to enjoy social situations, but I just don't. I'm not confident at all, in fact don't like the way I look at all, it feel like my look just doesn't express my personality well. I absolutely hate when people assign traits to me just based on my look and then when they get to know me better, they're like ""oh I thought that you're different."" 

  
I always get moments of motivation when I'm just like ""Oh it's so easy to become a better person, to get better at something etc."" but when I actually start doing it I can't keep it up for more then a few days. Then I just become apathetic and I'm back at the baseline. It's so sad to look at myself and count all the hobbies I've started and all the good habits I wanted to develop, because I failed it all. Someone once told me ""at least it makes you're life more interesting if you change your hobbies so often"" but no it doesn't, fuck it, I just want to be good at something, I don't want to be at the baseline all my life. I have a really bad problem with procrastination, I ignore stuff I need to do until I forget it or until it's too late and then I have to pull all nighters under horrible stress. I tried overcome it but I always get too apathetic when things get a little better and I'm not under stress anymore. It's really driving me mad, because most people tell me to just do it but I always fail. Nobody I talked to about it seems to understands me.  


I don't think I'm depressed but I feel sad a lot, like the world just seems to be a mess and a lot of people are fake and will abuse you if you show them kindness or help them. I just don't like to behave like an asshole to other people, but it seems that this world/society rewards it. For some odd reason, I like to search depressing topics on reddit and read through them. It somehow makes me feel good when I read posts about how fucked up the world is or how depressed someone is, even though I probably don't feel as bad as they do, I can usually relate. I also think that my emotions were more intense in the past, now they're more ordinary and boring. It's not that bad, but I have definitely noticed it. I'm also very indecisive and regretful.  


All in all it just makes me feel like a lesser human being. I can't get good at anything. I can't enjoy events other people would enjoy. I'm overthinking everything and that makes my so indecisive, I wish this voice in my head would just shut up, but I guess this voice is me. Idk why I can't be just normal. Anyway sorry for my bad English, it's not my native tongue and thank you for any answer/advice.",10Jul2018,2
39,"I get so over the top furious over the dumbest shit. i.e. someone doesn't get out of my way when I'm on my bike; someone (able-bodied) takes the elevator to/from the 2nd floor; etc. It gets to the point that it ruins my entire day. I am 100% aware that I'm being a stupid piece of shit, getting so mad over something dumb that I also probably do myself time to time. I've tried so many different mindfulness techniques and I'll manage to stay chill for a few weeks but it ALWAYS comes back again.

Is it depression/anxiety side effect? Is it insecurity? What is causing this emotional reaction because I have no clue. For the record I have very mild (and unmedicated) anxiety and depression which both come and go.

45,"Well, I'll try to make this as short as possible. My wife and I have 2 small children age 2 and 3. We didn't intend on having 2 kids so close in age and it's been a serious struggle as each of them are a handful on their own. I work and commute full time which means I'm out of the house about 11 hours every day. She stays home full time with them. We live in an incredibly expensive area because family is close by so money is very tight. Lately she has been having a really hard time. She is constantly depressed, angry, anxious. She has moments of her old self where she'll be happy and laugh, but they are usually bookended with something darker. Our marriage has been suffering and she has used the word ""divorce"" no less than 10 times in the last month. She is extremely critical of everything I say and do. I try really hard to be supportive and helpful but everything I do to help seems to be wrong, and everything I say seems to make it worse. The heart of her depression comes from the fact that she has to stay at home with the kids. I feel like she resents them and me for it. She tried to go back to work after our first son was born and lasted 1 month before she quit to stay hime full time. Now she feels she is stuck in this situation. Every logical suggestion I or others have made have been met with reasons why it won't work. Get a job and hire a nanny or daycare. ""I can't because then all the money I make will just go to the nanny or daycare."" Take more time for yourself at night and on the weekends ""I can't because we don't have the money for me to go do anything and there's no-one for me to go do things with."" Let's go away for the weekend. ""We can't because our family won't babysit and we can't afford to hire anyone to watch them, plus I don't want to leave my kids with a stranger."" Frustration with her situation often leads to her saying her only option is to strip at night or become a hooker. In fact most frustrating situations lead to conversations that end in the most extreme outcome. Like if our son is misbehaving then the conversation will be something like ""Great, he's going to get kicked out of 8 schools by the time he's ten and end up in juvenile hall and be a criminal his whole life."" She says this life isn't what she signed up for and that if she'd known this is what life was going to be like that she never would have had kids. She says she feels like dying. She isn't willing to go to therapy. Our marriage at this point is nothing more than 2 people living in the same space. When I try to give her a hug or kiss she actually cringes or turns her face to avoid mine. It's soul crushing. She has few friends, and most of them are pretty self absorbed and never ever check in to see how she's doing with the exception of one who lives over seas. The one person she talks to regularly is her mom. We've had so many talks about ways to change her situation and literally every suggestion is met with 100 reasons why it won't work. She almost seems to be fighting for reasons to stay in a situation she seems to absolutely hate. I am hanging on by a thread trying to be a good father, and a good provider, and trying my absolute hardest to be a loving supportive husband when I am getting nothing in return except a cold shoulder. I'm at my whits end and I don't know what to do. ",10Jul2018,3

Also, English is not my first language but I'll try to make it easy on the eyes.

I've been deeply depressed for some years now. I barely feel anything. I don't really enjoy many activities. I mostly stay on my own world or on my computer.

I would like a close family member to die just to see how it feels. I would like to take a life.
I imagine myself in violent acts and I feel alive, my eyes open wide, I breathe differently and I find joy in them.

I've been to psychiatrists and to psychologists and have some diagnosed mental conditions, and some weird stuff going on that I'm too scared to tell them. 
I started hearing voices some years ago. It started as multiple kids screaming my name at the same time and now it's just voices, I can't understand what they say but they are there. 

I'm at an ""okay"" point in my depression, but I've been really low and really close to ending it all. I tried medication but I didn't really like the idea.

I've only had one close friend in my entire life. It was during the best and worst time of my life, my early teenage years. I was friends with some really awesome people but it was a really tough time and probably the ultimate thing that made me fall into depression. It all involved the activity of rowing, so when I finally quit it I cut ties with everyone, and haven't had anyone to talk to during all this time.

I am a liberal person but the constant barrage of shaming and things to get angry about make me spiral and unable to focus on trying to keep myself healthy. I know it’s important to be aware but at what cost to keeping me sane? I struggle to move on from things as quickly as the media seems to be able to.

The idea of journalists getting awards and bullshit (which I know they do I’m friends with several) gets under my skin. I just can’t take it any more.

54,"I was seeing a new psychiatrist for a couple of months. At my last appointment she gave me a surprise urine test which I failed.  A friend had giving me some of his Adderall the day before. I know that I messed up by taking a dangerous medication that wasn't prescribed for me.  I was planning on sucking it up and taking the embarrassment and shame and apologizing to her.


Last week I had my first appointment with her since I failed the drug test. The night before the appointment the owner of the place she works at called me to tell me that she had terminated me as a client.  He told me she would no longer be prescribing my Prozac/Lamictal even though that appointment was for a refill and I was out.


He told me I needed to find another doctor to prescribe me antidepressants. He advised me that I should start the process of getting into rehab so that when I saw the doctor I could tell him that I was already working on it. He then told me that I needed to be upfront with the new doctor and tell them that I had been abusing drugs because, and I quote, ""We're just going to tell him you popped on a urine test anyways so it would be better if they heard it from you first.


My question is does doctor-patient confidentiality cover the results of a drug test? Can anyone from my old psychiatrists office, whether it's the psychiatrist herself or the owner, share the fact that I failed my drug test with the next Doctor that I see?


Thanks.

55,"I’ve struggled with depression for around 9 years. I remember certain periods within the 9 years that I felt “okay”, and maybe not depressed. I’ve been on and off medication cause I don’t really wanna be taking pills all my life. 

However over the last year I’ve really struggled, have lost all of my friends, changed jobs, and all of my old hobbies don’t appeal to me (at all) anymore. 

There’s a couple of mental disorders I think I may have (BPD or Bipolar). I’m worried about bringing it up to my doctor - will they think I’m faking it? Will they think I’ve just googled all the symptoms and self diagnosed? 

What is the best way to approach the issue? ",10Jul2018,2
56,"I have severe ADHD, combined with depression. My close friends and family know about my mental health issues. I am well educated and have work experience, but I am petrified of getting into getting into my dream job. I have a great social life and I meet many people, but I cannot connect with them deeply or be vulnerable. I have a couple of true friends. I am the person people turn to for my wisdom, but I am always the mentor. I, the mentally ill one, am the supporter, not the supported. 

I am an avoidant person, I avoid pain, because I am already feeling so much of it. Everyone expects me to do better because I'm smart, and they expect me to reason with myself until I am no longer like this, but ADHD is a genetic neurological condition, it's not behavioural. My depression is mostly from the fact that it feels out of my control and I no longer can see a future for myself. Having a dream feels like a luxury I cannot afford. 

Perhaps they are fooled by the parts of me that can be helpful and useful to them. I know they respect my knowledge on things, my wisdom, my ability to help them reason with things when they can't, with my sister the fact that I can look after the kids whenever she needs me and do her last minute favours all the time, that I'm there for everyone and actually helpful to them when they need me or whatever, that the part where I am a great friend and sister fools them into thinking I'm functioning. 

But how can they not see that I am not functioning? Why is my mental health or my issues the elephant in the room all the time? I want to scream at them to just wake up and acknowledge that I am drowning here!!! Why won't they ask me what's up? Why won't they see if I'm ok? Why won't they offer any sort of support? How do I start talking to people about these things? How? I feel angry with them and I feel let down yet I feel desperate for help that they won't give to me because they have gotten away with it for years. 

Maybe I am being unreasonable here, it has gotten to the point where I feel completely isolated in my illness and no one will acknowledge it and see how I am. ",10Jul2018,3

I never used to act like this i was so confident, but after my father passed away from liver failure when I was 12 I've just felt so disconnected from everyone around me I didn't leave my room for 3 years after he died except to go to school and places with family which meant I never really devolped any friends outside school which I now regret massively because I haven't had half of the experiences a normal teenager is supposed to have, never been to a house party etc. I think my self inflicted isolation was a reaction to my dad dieing because he was alot more than just my dad he was my best friend in a way and I can't explain in words how much I miss him. But now 5 years down the line I have one friend in my entire life who I feel like just uses me for free weed a doggo who has to put up with a depressed human trying to talk to him 😂 and a girlfriend of 2 years who I've never explained any of this too because I fear she'll think im too clingy/crazy 

I don't really know what the point of this post is but I just needed to get it all off my chest I'm so fed up of being the quiet person in the room even when I try to talk sometimes people with louder personalitys talk over me and just don't give me a chance to talk it's so infuriating I genuinely can't remember the last meaningful conversation I had with another human being.

59,"Hello all,

I am having some difficulties figuring out which career path to take in the mental health career field. I am currently a senior at the University of Minnesota and will be graduating with my B.S. in Family Social Science, (Not sure if most people know that degree, feel free to look it up) with a minor in Prevention in Domestic Abuse. I have been talking to one of my professor about this and some psychologists that I work with. I have been doing my own research as well but would like to hear more from others out there in the field. I know in the end it is what I am most interested in and can see doing in the long run.

**Background:**

I am currently studying for the GRE and taking it in late December 2018.

I have volunteered at a suicide &amp; domestic abuse 24 Hr Hotline.

My current GPA is 3.6

I have worked intensively with two professors at school on their research.

I work in a private practice with other psychologists and help them out with testing and other admin tasks.

**Interests:**

1-1 clientele is something I am very interested in. Just being able to help someone through that face-to-face contact.

I worked in the hospital setting in the past and do miss the environment.

Interested in Research but a bit confused on how it all works out. Is it hard to get grants, etc.

Interested in teaching in college as a professor, in the future.

I am interested on earning a Masters of Science in one of the mental health careers. I am not so sure on PhD or PsyD quite yet, since they are pretty expensive.

**Questions:**

1. I understand that the mental health career does not get you rich, but looking at all the career in the field I would like to choose one that is at least worth spending my education/money on. For example, (correct me if I am wrong) I've seen and heard that LMFT are underpaid and can be hard for some to find jobs after graduate school. I was originally going to go towards the LMFT route but did more researching and I am now unsure.
2. LCSW is something I'm quite interested in as of right now, more than the others I would say. I was curious how the job outlook was for LCSW? I am assuming not bad, since there are more job offers out there for those in the social work field. Also, since I am interested in working in the hospital setting again, would you say that LCSW tend to get hired from hospitals?
3. I did some research on Clinical and Counseling Psychology and was wondering if earning a Masters for any of these two is a good choice? From my research I did not find much on people working in these field with their Masters, it's usually PhD or PsyD. It's just at the moment I would not like to pursue anything more than a Masters.
4. What are some pros and cons for you specifically in your mental health career?
5. Any kinds of warning or caution before I make a choice in graduate school?

Thank you!",10Jul2018,1

First I'll ask my question: 

Should my husband and I move back to his home of Canada even though we've wasted 9 months in America waiting on U.S. immigration?  Basically should I possibly give up my year almost two years worth of college credits to move to the better place?  Also should I talk my husband into moving back to his home (he wants to love but is scared because he doesn't want to have wasted 9 months)?  

 Second I'll give background info:

my husband and I have been married nearly a year now and are living in America which is where I am from and where my family is. He on the other hand was born and raised in Ontario, Canada.  His parents have been very helpful and even given me money (even though they don't  know he and I are married because he doesn't want to stress them out but that's not that point of my story). My husband and I currently live with my family who have been pretty good to us but also caused a lot of drama and crap tons of stress.  My husband has been going through the U.S. immigration process and now can finally work in the states the only problem is he hasn't found a job... So that means months without work or even health insurance.  He and I both have depression and anxiety so this has been a super stressful year for us.  ",10Jul2018,1

71,"Hey reddit,
So.....Im here because I feel like I just need someone to talk to me and tell me a reason as to why I feel like this, and honestly I dont think im going to like the answer.

im 28, for the past 4 years ive been in a relationship with an amazing woman. we had a rough start to the relationship I think it was caused because I couldnt seperate the single me from the relationship me. not in a sexual way but in a behavioural way.
For past 3 years we have live together and havnt had a single night apart from each other. and honestly I wouldnt want it any other way and I know she is the same. 

here is my problem though, we have very drastic taste in things. the only time I can listen to what music I like is when she is at work. she hates my shouty music as it gives her a headache, and i understand that. She likes to always talk, and I just like sitting quitly sometimes. mainly in the mornings. She loves non stop messaging. I tell her I cant get my phone out at work due to Data protechtion rules and can only message on breaks and lunch and I get silent treatment till I reassure her that ill still call and message.

I used to be a reasonable fit person who would walk for miles at a time for just the simple enjoyment of it, I would ride my motorbike and get to know every road in my town (now moved to a whole new county and I just know the way to work and back) I know they say that you gain weight in a relationship because youre happy and I accpt that. but constanly not being able to dress in what I like because im told it isnt attractive, not listening to my own music being scolded for cutting my hair short instead of letting it grow out as its how she likes it.
I know its alot of issues with her attitude but I love her more than anything and she has made me a massivly better person. Id only regreate a day apart from her. But I just dont feel like me any more. I cant have a day to myself as she would take it as I want to be away from her, I have to inlude her in all my hobbies which take a draw back beause her hayfever means I cant enjoy a walk int he woods before she wants to go back. but she does try which is nice. I just wish i could do it alone in the first place.

74,"Please note I’m new to this... sorry if I’m out of order or anything I tried my best.........Okay.. some backstory. I’m 24 female and I had two kids back to back (got pregnant again 32 months after daughter) I have been clinically diagnosed with bipolar depression PTSD and severe anxiety (although my life wasn’t bad at all, but actually I seemed to be the personality type that internalized the HELL out of the events that you might consider traumatic for kids in adolescence and I still do) like I said - great childhood but life isn’t perfect (deaths, molestation etc) things I suffered from that unfortunately some of the best parents can’t predict and aren’t perfect. 

So anyways with that being said... here I am 8 months after I made huge mistake with marijuana and I am now I’m in a case plan (it’s okay I already VOLUNTARILY did everything they could think of and now at this point seems they’re pretty pleases with my progress) I admit I shouldn’t have been smoking illegally but it seems they wanted to make a point to me and they are...  

I’m really sorry for the long story I’m not used to this. So anyway I’m very happy with my new boyfriend that thankfully has opened his home only one month after this started so I can have a home(can’t “live” at my actual home till this is over) and it’s hard guys. He’s so good to me and I’m madly in love and he’s very sweet to my kids. So that’s not my issue. Yea we fight but I’m mentally ok enough to realize those fights aren’t big enough to warrant my concern with the post.... although as a collective I’m sure they affect it of course. But like I said ... I internalize issues do bad they ruin my life sometimes. Small or big. I live with constant yearning for my babies so bad guys. Crying as I type this I am constantly constantly just pushing away thoughts so I don’t hurt. For 8 months now.  

So now that I have at least tried my best to get you guys to understand how I’m feeling constant say to day basis ... I have noticed for 3 months now I will go days not eating till I’m having actual hunger pains. To where I’m throwing up bile. My boyfriend will try to get me to eat I’ll take a single bite and I just can’t. Then when I do eat it’s only like 4 bites and I feel like I’m gonna vomit. I’m not like writing down a journal or what not to eat and what I eat or purposely throwing up though.... I will tell you I watched my mother growing up have TERRIBLE EATING habits especially during times of stress and I would watch my father and her get into quite heated arguments because my father to this day loves my mother and he truly believed it was his duty to see my mother be well taken care of. So maybe I get it from her? I’ve done this before in and out of my life but never for months at a time. Idk maybe some insight would help guys......... 

Also can all of this make my cycle late? I’ve been days to a week late for my cycle the last 3 months as well and although we are safe with sex I just don’t need that worry every month lol I will worry about something I know until I see otherwise in front of me. Which is dumb.... that’s anxiety for yah.

This also came to me when I was giving advice to my friend about another mutual who I know she struggles with. So while giving advice on how to deal with him and further explaining the issues surrounding him, I realized I sound a lot like the said friend. 

I'm always somehow hurting my friends -- the ones closest to me. I love to debate and win things, and I won't stop until I do. This means I completely switch attitudes and I will go into deep, hurtful details to win. But I don't even feel guilty about it. I don't care if they are hurt by me. I'm a toxic person because I only lean on them for my own personal emotional support and attention. They all come to me with rants, and I let them tell me, but in reality I do not care at all about what they think. I think I end up putting up an act to show that I care but I can't connect or make myself truly feel/care about their issues. 

I have no problem leaving or walking away from them, and it has happened several times after arguments. I have no idea why I'm like this to be honest and it's just hitting me now. 

On a side note, I also sometimes get extremely intrusive thoughts which aren't pleasant at all and I would never act on them, but they get so vivid and clear in my head for whatever reason. I think I also come off as disturbing to my friends in a way that I tend to twist my words about subjects to make them sound really cruel and attacking I think.
