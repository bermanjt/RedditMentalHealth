I guess that's just being caffeinated, but it also makes me feel SO much better as far as mental health/depression/avoiding sleeping too much goes (my depression has been manifesting lately as really excessive sleep). Has anyone ever been suggested to take caffeine pills for mental health reasons?",27Nov2018,1
1,"Once again not sure if this is the right sub, but here goes. My thirteen year old brother is way into news like WAY into current events. He often enters political debates with people double and tripple his age. The problem is his awareness of the nations political environment has spun him into some sort of existential dread, he often breaks down crying because of the state of the world.

7,"Dear r/Mental Health 

Recently a friend I know from Europe(Netherlands) confided in me their struggle with depression that has been kept secret from all who are close for fear of the stigma and a loss of work as they spend much of it in the public eye as a model while going to school.

 They are due to have surgery at the end of the month which absorbs all of their available coverage for the year and as a student this has left them with a $450 Euro gap to cover their medication for the coming year after tuition ect.

My research into the Netherlands healthcare system was pretty similar to my experience here in Canada with this having been a situation I myself have experienced where there are no resources to ""Close the gap"".

I plan to donate money I had put aside for the full amount but had to replace my phone today which left me with about $100 CAD which I plan to send via Paypal at the end of the week.

 I'm hoping someone has experience in the Netherlands with advice on how to help.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:Netherlands health coverage leaves my friend $450 short for medication 

I'm donating the rest of my savings and need advice on how to help with the rest.

So I'm 20, my girlfriend is 18 and she struggles quite badly with her mental health. I try my best to be understanding but recently it's been getting harder and harder, been causing more arguments etc.

10,"I’m so stressed about finals I’m dying. I completely screwed up one assignment in my best class and lost all the research and now it’s due on Wednesday and I just can’t get it done. Along with that, I’ve got a 7 page research paper due in a class that students have been complaining for years should not be a 100 level class (grad level work, freshman level class = doesn’t add up). I’ve had no time to do any of the research and the topic barely relates to the course because half the stuff we needed wasn’t addressed until the other day and I’m freaking out and honestly I’m just dying. All of this is piled on top of our actual final exams. 

I keep thinking that if I just walk in front of a car and let it hit me then I’ll at least be able to get an extension. 

I hate this school and I hate where i am and I’m so depressed and I just don’t have the energy to do anything or even finish the work. All my motivation is gone but I’m just filled with terror about it all. I just need more time. ",27Nov2018,1
11,"Not usually one to seek out help and ask for advice on MH issues. I work in emergency services (Police) And have regularly come into contact with dead persons. In my mid 20s never really had issues. However today I was single crewed by myself attended a call about a guy who no one had seen for a while. Had someone who looked after the block of apartments let me in the property.

Gained entry to his apartment and well found him in quite a state.. (few weeks decomposed) I stood there alone in a dimly lit bedroom at the foot of the bed with this male who was deceased with little sound eerily quiet and oddly peaceful environment. 

I observed him for several minutes, I looked around the bedroom, looking for anything that might help me determine what the cause is and anything I can update my operator with. I kept looking at him expecting him to turn his head or move a body part to say he wasn't dead and the more I was in the room the more I began to feel this odd waterfall type feeling. Like a rush of emotion and wanting to get out but knowing that I have no one else to take over and keeping myself there. Eventually others turned up and I was able to get out however in this 10 minutes it felt like everything I do with work, personal stuff will be for nothing and life will be like this man, forgotten about, cold and dead and all for nothing.

This is the first time I've have felt like this and can't seem to shake it off. Is it normal or something that will pass?

12,"A few nights ago, I was sitting in my car outside a store with my mother, waiting for her to get back. Out of nowhere, I suddenly felt my body 'jolt' and I felt this wave of pure panic and started hyperventilating. I had been looking at a picture of myself and my mother on my phone, and all of a sudden I felt disconnected with the picture of myself. I didn't recognize myself, I was looking at the picture and I just couldn't connect it to myself. It's impossible to describe now, but I felt like I was dying. 
I had no idea who I was. I felt like my family weren't real, and that I wasn't 'here'. I couldn't make sense of the human experience, I felt like I had entirely lost grip with reality. My mother returned to the car and I was screaming at her to take me to the hospital, that I needed mental help right away because I had lost touch with reality. I did have the presence of mind to think ""I have finally snapped, I have actually lost my mind and this is what going insane feels like"". I stayed like that for about an hour, and after an hour of hysterically crying and feeling ENTIRELY detached from reality it started to go away. My mother drove me home and I slept for a long time. I haven't experienced it since and I'm just wondering if this sounds like it's depersonalization? If so, it's fucking horrendous. ",27Nov2018,1

18,"So, after a few years of being... different from everybody else, I've come to realize that I need help. From a counselor, and therapist, or a psychologist. My friends and other people on Reddit said that I most likely have Asperger's syndrome; however, my parents disagree. I talked to my mom about letting me see a therapist, and she said I could get one if I want to. She had little concern in her voice, and I'm sure my dad will be the same way. Apparently, the violent mood swings, isolation, and anxiety aren't enough for them.

My dad sat me down earlier to talk with me, and he says he doesn't know what to do with me anymore. The things that I sometimes do are rude to them, but don't see rude to me. He says if I act this way at school, that's the reason I don't have many friends.

There are so many things wrong with me. My parents always say I can talk to them, but the thing is, I know that they care, but they show little concern or think that I can solve it out myself.

I need to talk to a counselor or somebody, just not my parents. Suprisingly, I feel uncomfortable talking to them; they always want me to look them straight in the eye and just talk to them, but it really isn't that easy. How do I solve this and convince my parents that there is something wrong with me and it's not just puberty?",27Nov2018,1

21,"Is it just me, or does it seem like more and more people have some type of mental health issue or show symptoms of such, most of whom are not even aware of it?

I've always been extremely introspective and observant as well as a people pleaser right out the gate that my Nparents groomed to be instant-maid/instant-nanny-just-add-water. 

This in combination with multiple abusive partners, experiences while in the military, and going all through the spectrum of codependency, enabling, and counter dependency means I am certifiably fucked up; and have been for quite some time.

Over the years with guidance, study, medication, and critical self observation; I've managed to at the very least understand the what, why, and how of most of my issues. With understanding also came accepting responsibility for my mental health, ie; not making it other peoples problems or expecting others to put up with it/just be okay with it. 

That being said, maybe I just am a magnet for 'crazy', but it feels like I am constantly surrounded by people who have just as many, if not more issues than I do, except they seem either unaware of such or refuse to take responsibility or even acknowledge such. 

A few years ago I cut a lot of toxic relationships from my life; abusers, manipulators, etc. Since then, I have been very much aware of certain traits/practices in people, avoiding red flag situations. Except it feels like more and more people are popping red flags?? 

Be it narcissism, delusion, self-victimization, you name it; it seems more and more like the majority of society is sick and I am the one that has to consistently confer with therapists, peers, witnesses that I am not the crazy one? I mean, yeah I have plenty of issues, but I feel like I am consistently being gaslit by others which has been a huge pain with just the amount of time I spend questioning my sanity in scenarios, only to have objective witnesses confirm that no I'm not crazy, and even with such still feel like it.

My life isn’t “bad.” I don’t want to end it and I don’t “hate” myself. I just feel like I’ve always felt this deep sadness in me that can come out anytime if I just get into my thoughts too much. It’s like I have to turn everything off and go into a “zombie” like state in order to keep a lid on the tears and weeping. 

Everything is worse at night laying in bed. Memories and images, and bad thoughts just hijack my brain. I usually wake up feeling gloomy like I’m walking through a fog. I distract myself well enough during the day to keep my brain occupied but I feel at any minute if I just stopped and thought for a few seconds about something sad I could just start weeping and break down for an hour.

37,"afab-nb/26, US, My current diagnoses are Bipolar Disorder type 2 and Bulimia Nervosa.

Background- My problems started around 16yo, starting with my eating disorder and depression/anxiety. I started trying to find meds at 18, was diagnosed with Major Depression and Social/General Anxiety Disorders. After 6 years of unsuccessful antidepressants and a hospitalization, a bump up in dosage sent me into a hypomanic episode and my diagnosis was changed to BP2. My psych and I put together that I never experienced depression and anxiety at the same time, each lasting a week or so before switching, so it made sense. Just after this, I graduated college and got a job on the other side of the country, thinking the change in environment would help. It didn't. I made it through the school year, barely (art teacher), my bipolar worsening as the year ended, my anxiety shifting into hypomania. Started taking lithium over the summer and had a ton of side effects. Came back for the new school year and barely made it 2 weeks. I was hospitalized for 5 days for having suicidal thoughts with a plan and cutting. Discharged while hypo, rehospitalized a week later for the same thing, having a new depressive episode. At this point, I was switching every 5-7 days. Another 5 days in, I was discharged when I got hypo again. Became depressed right after. Had to quit my job because the cycle was unending, and I hadn't been to work for over 3 weeks. Tried Lamictal and Zyprexa during this time, dropped for side effects and noneffectiveness. Moved back in with Dad and my brother. Hospitalized AGAIN for the same. fucking. shit. In for 10 days. Weaned off the Effexor I'd been taking for 2 years just because it's near impossible to get off of. SURPRISE, it actually stopped my anxiety, so now that's back and my hypomania is just a stew of anxiety and muscle tension, no longer energetic and feel-good and restless. All the while, I've been bulimic off and on for a decade. Currently, I'm on Depakote, Pristiq, gabapentin (for depression pain), and clonidine (for restlessness and anxiety). On top of that, I get the fun of being trans-nonbinary.

My biggest issue- Between the bipolar depression and anxiety and hypomania and bulimia, I have no idea where to start. I want to lose weight because my clothes are getting tight and I have no job, so no money to buy new clothes. I've been trying so long to fix my depression that it feel like it's a lost cause. I'm afraid that I won't survive long enough for my new meds to kick in (if they even will), that I'll either have a mental break of some kind or be hospitalized a 4th time this quarter. That I'll actually make an attempt on my life before I can see any results.

I'm just so tired of trying at this point. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm jobless, can barely function, and feel like a burden on my family. All of my issues are feeding off one another in this weird web of destructive thoughts.

Note- I'm currently hypo/anxious, so I'm in no danger of myself. I'm not currently suicidal or having self-harming thoughts. I haven't purged for a few weeks, but the thoughts are still there. We'll see what happens when I switch in a few days :/ I also start a partial program on Thursday, but no psych or therapist until then (because of the move back).

tldr, after 10 years of bipolar and bulimia, I'm afraid I'm giving up, that I'm about to break and/or will try to kill myself.",27Nov2018,1
38,"I heard about a suicide yesterday. University student, slightly older than me. Regularly posted about her depression on social media, even left so much as an obvious hint that she was going to do it, but why didn't anyone stop her? Why wasn't anyone even a little bit concerned? Because teenage kids think it's funny to post about depression on social media, they do it for attention, for the 'memes'. 

I could open Instagram right now and view a bunch of stories of people saying 'haha I wanna die lmao'. How is one supposed to differentiate? How is one supposed to know who is actually suffering from depression and who is just being an attention seeking asshole, just because it's 'funny?

Ever since I heard about it yesterday, I just can not stop thinking about it. Even the most unrelated things will suddenly get me thinking about it again and I honestly can't stop. I have been suffering from depression for the past few years, mostly due to academic related stuff, but partially due to family problems as well, so hearing about suicides due to depression really screw me up, but this one was just something else. This one actually hurts. Someone who seems so cheerful one day is just gone the next day. 

I didn't even know this girl, yesterday was the first time I heard of her and just scrolling through some stuff she posted on social media, makes me feel like I've known her for a lifetime. It's so heartbreaking when people my age take their own lives and the fact that it happens so often doesn't give me much hope. 

Now, to the main point of this thread, how can I get my mind off this? Literally everything I do causes the thought to pop back into my head and I want it to stop. I can't go about my day normally if all I'm thinking about is this. I barely slept last night. 

To those suffering from depression, and those thinking about suicide being the easy way out, please please please don't. I know I'm just a random person on the internet and my words mean nothing, but the amount of pain caused by your loss is inexplicable. It hurts, mentally and physically. 

To the girl who took her own life yesterday... I'm sorry. I'm sorry that society neglected you, I'm sorry that nobody reached out. I'm sorry that nobody noticed the signs. I'm truly sorry for what you had to go through that led you to take your own life. 
Rest in peace. ♥️",27Nov2018,1

46,"i guess i just need to vent. had a rough night.  


My parents marriage has been a disaster from the very beginning, I am in my mid twenties. Growing up, they have always been fighting but always reluctant to get a divorce and I just don't get it until this day. They could fight about everything. It usually started with my dad's poor attitude and my mom started to get irritated and yelled at him. It ended with my dad apologizing and my mom still wanted to argue. I remembered them fighting all the time, back when I was in preschool, I was still surprised that I could remember something that far and the the fight was still vivid.  My dad has a short temper and it is something that my mom can't stand. They always like to get my involved in their fight and ask me to pick a side, since i was in elementary school. My mom is argumentative and its something my dad can't stand. My dad has cheated on my mom multiple times while my mom literally took care of everything in the house and worked. My mom as a resulted cheated on him as a revenge. All these started 10+ years ago and has been on and off. I resented both for ruining the family and handled things poorly and started to become very irritable when I was 11.  


Things started to get better for the past few years and none of them have had huge fights. Until last night. It brought me back all the old memories. When I got older, I was able to be the mediator even though I didn't want to, I just wanted them to get a divorce. I knew it was not my job to be the mediator, and having me as a mediator was hurting my mental health, I knew it. but they were my parents, not just some friends or strangers. I am close with them both and love them dearly. I couldn't just leave them like that, it hurt to see them fighting like that. They both did sacrifice a lot for me, they were good parents to me, they just werent a good partner to each other.  


Last night, if I didn't do it, they could have gotton violent and it would have probably be on the news the next morning, i knew one of them would be dead. Things cooled down after I started to analyze. My focus of study is quite close to psychology and therapy so  I pointed out their ongoing toxic communication style and discussed how they could move on from this fight, instead of keep going back and forth....etc. They all agreed and started to see how they both needed to have things to work on. The night ended with them both apologizing to me for getting me involved. I knew it wouldn't be the last time of fighting until they decided to end their marriage. Honestly, I was exhausted, it went on for hours. I felt like I was always the therapist for them and communication specialist because of my area of study in school and my personality, just being able to be analytical and calm. (My mom usually got super irrational during fights.) And I am sick of it.

To me this whole marriage was dead from the start. They are not compatible at all. My mom did a therapy before and it broke her, she cried because of old wounds were brought up and they became fresh again. She had to walk out. She said it just wasn't the right method.  


 I encouraged them both to get a divorce so we can all have peace but they both didn't want to. I have always had poor mental health but I never told them. It started with depression, eating disorders, anxiety, and suicidal. I don't have a poor life, Ive never starved to death or anything terrible like that. My mom kind of knew but wasn't sure. Last night, my mom finally knew about how my poor mental health was ""partially"" resulted from their toxic marriage for the past 20+ years. She felt regretful and miserable about it. I have been always in a ""constant alert status"" because I always afraid one of them would kill another. They are from a different culture/ generation than me where they see getting the police involved would be embarrassing. ",27Nov2018,1
47,"I know this is a very broad question, and I really don't know where to start. I think the best way to understand the situation is to explain my train of thought. I guess I'll start by saying growing up, I feel like I had depression. I was very anti social and barely had any form of social interactions with anyone. I spent most of my time by myself at home alone. My parent's marriage wasn't too stable, and they divorced when I was young. I have a helicopter mom that would do things like beat me to installing a camera in the living room to monitor me when she is not home, saying it was a fire alarm. I never really had people I could talk to about my problems or how I felt. Recently, I've gotten closer with people I met in college and finding out what it means to care for someone. I started talking to them about how I feel and the things I went trough. Sometimes they would come to me as well about their problems, but I always feel like I never seem to be able to find any words to say. Like it is so hard for me to formulate anything to say back to them. It's like all I feel is sympathy and empathy for them but I just do not know how to respond at all and I spend most of the time sitting there in silence coming up with something to say. I also feel like I do not even understand enough of my own feelings to able to help. I don't think half of the things I say are even helping them at all, and I'm just making the situation worse.

50,"This is going to be pretty long,  so sorry in advance. 

I have been suffering with depression and who knows what else for a little over a year now. Ever since this summer and since school started back up it has gone way downhill.  I am failing history class because I can't focus long enough to get assignments done.  I recently have gotten meds for ADHD, because I have a lot of the symptoms of it. It has helped me a little but I still am doing horribly.

 My parents have a toxic relationship,  and it's been like that for as long as I can remember. My dad always tries to get along with my mom but she never. Treats him like an equal. She also treats me and my siblings horribly, and picks favourites. The only way I can get her to appreciate me or care for me is if I suck up to her,  which I am sick and tired of doing. She constantly gaslights us and is emotionally abusive.

 I hadn't even noticed that it was wrong until me and my sister brought it up to my aunt.  I've basically come to the conclusion that she is a narcissist, seeing as she always needs things to be her way and she thinks that she's never wrong. We all had a talk with her to let her know how she is affecting us and she hasn't made even an attempt to change since. The past year I went through a lot and I have so much stress.  I've gotten to the point where I don't care if my mom or anyone hates me anymore and I don't care too much if I fail a class. But I contradict myself because I also care about all of that A LOT. 

Anyways, the reason why I'm posting this is because I don't know what to do. It's almost 3 am right now and I can't handle this anymore. My mom and I got into a fight earlier over something stupid and she's threatening to disconnect my phone tomorrow. I so badly just want to escape everything. I developed suicidal thoughts and self harm these past few months. I want to call the crisis hotline tonight seeing as my phone will most likely be disconnected tomorrow, but I'm terrified. Not necessarily of calling, but of how my family and friends will react to it. I am almost certain that they will send police here if I call, which I'm only slightly scared about. I want them to take me away from my house so I can escape all of the stress. But I don't want to leave my older sister or my dad. I need help on whether I should call or not because I so badly want to but my dad will probably be angry and so will my mom (who I'm not so worried about) and I don't know. How my siblings will react. I've been through this situation multiple times where I want to call but end up not doing it because of how they would react and if my friends would find out. Please help.

51,"Question: *How do SSRIs directly cause Huntington's Disease?* 

*There was a scientific publication a while back on the dangers of* ***SSRI*** *medication. A small section spoke on the* ***link between*** ***Huntington's disease and SSRI usage/cessation.***

&amp;#x200B;

***There was a report a while back as follows:***

a well known Doctor murdered his father, and said it was due to SSRI cessation. 

The story did not really detail as to how long he had been taking the medication, but what was clear was that he had missed ONE dose and had a complete split from his 'normal' self. 

He had various psychiatric evaluations, and nobody believed him and most psychiatrists stated the doctor was 'faking' it. The Police were no help because this \[psych claims\], presumably, was not in their briefing/ability. 

The police even set up a camera in which to see how he acted around the inmates, in contrast to the professionals and agents/officers. Apparently convinced he was faking it due to the behavior witnessed, the Doctor was facing serious time.

To make matters worse he did NOT get his medication during his time in prison, and was denied it! A medication he had taken....Regardless if it caused the damage to begin with, it had become a part of his day to day life/brain function up until the incident. 

To make the post short: He later got a type of genetic test/karyotype due to one individual claiming he knew what this Doctor really had; and that he was not 'faking a condition'. 

The tests done revealed he had ***Huntington's disease***. Which in short is: the deterioration of the brain which ultimately results in death. 

But the story did not state that the SSRIs had directly caused the development of this condition. IF the predisposition was there, I highly doubt it had not been caught earlier in order to prepare for this. If he had taken his medication, he never would have done this....

&amp;#x200B;

Since he has this brain debilitating disease, he was then given the SSRI dosage he used to take and it stabilized him...for now...but the disease is ongoing...And the SSRI, although helping him currently, is doing worse damage to the condition. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I believe there is a suit underway as well.

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions I had for Psych Majors, Psychiatrists,and Med students \[but the general public too!\]

1. SSRIs are known to treat certain conditions and co-morbidity resulting from said condition...But how do they worsen the condition \[namely Huntington's disease\]? 
2. Serotonin Syndrome results from overload of the chemical and fried receptors, how can it be repaired? 
3. How do SSRIs play a role in the development of Huntington's disease \[as well as others\] on adults over the age of 40, in contrast to people around 20 and 30 years of age?",27Nov2018,1

I need time to be certain that these are my real emotions instead of fear of losing the people I care. I need time to come into terms with what I had done and why it happened. I need time to actually dig into my broken self and discover why I am broken.

59,"### As a startup founder, here are 4 tips you can follow when you find yourself in the 'founder's blues':

**- Understand mental health.** According to Kristen Cooper, ""Mental illness is a medical problem. No one should be ashamed of mental illness. mental illnesses “are health conditions involving changes in thinking, emotion or behaviour (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses are associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work or family activities.” There is a wide range of mental illnesses, and symptoms should be discussed with doctors and psychotherapists. Founders can help employees by making a list of psychotherapy providers covered by the company’s health plan and sharing it with them.""  
**- Be honest.** Abdullah Snobal has a better advice for you ""If we want to get serious about mental health in tech, we need to be honest about the environment in which we work in. Unfortunately, there is often no work-life balance for entrepreneurs. That is just the nature of the beast — there are short runs of funding and high expectations...That’s why many feel it’s crucial to work endlessly and stay hungry — it’s a way of survival. And as a tech startup founder, you have to be aware of the fact that scaling your startup causes a high-stress environment, which can take a toll on you and your staff.""  
**- Create safe spaces for** **employee.** Abdullah continues; ""As a very first step, founders should implement biweekly, one-on-one meetings with their staff. These meetings shouldn’t only be about work-related updates -- they should also be a moment to address any personal concerns an employee might be having. These initial steps can lead the way to develop an open-door policy within your business.""  
**- Take ownership of your most valuable asset - ""Yourself"".** This time from Reddit co-founder [Alexis Ohanian](https://medium.com/initialized-capital/zero-lives-remaining-f60e909b5d6a) \- ""That starts with exercise and wellness for your body and your mind. Moderate the garbage you’re putting into your body and commit yourself to a healthy routine — you don’t need any equipment to do a wide range of [bodyweight exercises](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/) or go for a run. Founders especially will forget this because we’re so busy out-grinding one another.""",27Nov2018,1

61,"So I've been talking to myself since I was 5. Fairly normal thing right? Well the thing that concerns me is that when I talk to myself I can manifest a copy of myself and see it. When I'm in the middle of a conversation with myself I completely forget that I am simply having a conversation with my mind and feel as if I'm talk to a person that completely understands me. However, this other copy of myself(which is just my mind/me) seems to have a slightly different way of viewing things. Like normal me isnt optimistic but I'm not entirely pessimistic but when I begin having a conversation with myself my copy is a lot more cynical and pessimistic. It has told me things like ""I'm you're best friend. Nobody knows you better than I know you"" and other stuff that leads me to distrust others or believe that they aren't my real friends and only pretend to be. I just want to know if anyone else experiences something like this when they talk to themselves. Does your mind manifest another person or a copy of yourself? Is this normal? Should I see a professional about this? I've spoken to my friends about this and they say it could be some dissociative disorder so now I'm paranoid.",27Nov2018,1
62,"Let me just clarify; personally I feel like my problems shouldn’t be considered problems. I lack a lot of feelings a lot of the time, i’m always exhausted, everything makes me panicked and am very prone to anxiety attacks but because I can sort of ignore it and just continue on with my life as if i’m not struggling makes me feel like i’m not anxious or depressed.

I feel as if i’ve developed some type of eating disorder as well, I struggle to eat purely because I don’t feel hunger or I feel sick at the thought of food even if I haven’t eaten in over 24+ hours. More often then not the prospect of eating food, even food I enjoy, disgusts me or is unappealing to me. But as I do force myself to eat or because if i’m with people I do eat for some reason, I don’t really believe that I do have a problem with this, even though trying to chew food makes me feel like I have glue in my mouth.

Logically, it sounds as if I have a problem but I’ve convinced myself that I don’t. Can anyone explain this or does anyone else feel like this?",27Nov2018,1
63,"Hi guys,

I've had this really weird thing going on for years linked with my anxiety. Sometimes I get attacks where I seizure, similar to epilepsy, but I am awake and aware of everything that is going on. It's like my entire body just reaps havoc, like my brain presses all the buttons it can find, sending thousands of nerve-signals out at the same time, until all of my body's energy has been used up, which can take up to an hour. Think like, a grand mal seizure going on for ~30-60 minutes. 

I can somewhat 'control' it (sometimes, depending on severety), meaning I conract all my muscles to try to hinder me from hurting myself (like my head hitting the floor etc)
During the attacks I experience severe panic and death anxiety, sometimes screaming from complete terror.

For the longest time I thought this was how everyone experienced panic attacks, but since I were at the mental hospital some weeks this spring, I've learnt this is not the case.
My psychologist have mentioned that it might be a form of dissociation.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Or does anyone have dissociation, regardless what kind?",27Nov2018,1
64,"Gradually over the past few years I feel like my brain's been dying somehow, but in recent months it's getting super bad. I sleep 12 hours a day and need an afternoon nap to function, I have the energy levels of an 80 year old man, I no longer have energy to socialize in any capacity, sometimes I don't even open my mouth to speak because I can't muster the will to conjure speech. My sex drive has been completely dead for years I might as well be impotent. Exercise just makes me tired with not a single bit of improvement; back in my teens I used to get some kind of dopaminergic reward from exercise but now its a completely effortful, futile activity. If no one takes care of me I'll just sit here and starve to death because my brain cannot even be arsed to feel hunger/care about my life/generate the willpower to make a meal. I'm only in my 20s.

Is this a symptom of depression? I don't feel sad or anything. I just feel completely 'out of it', like my brain has been running on low battery for the past several months, completely drained. Can't think/focus/do any kind of intellectual activity. I'm also worried about schizophrenia because I notice that I'm starting to say things that don't make sense/starting to have speech problems/poverty of speech/extreme flat affect etc. which I always had but was able to mask. Or maybe its executive dysfunction or autistic burnout or one of those things. Now I don't even have the energy to pretend to be normal, nowadays I'm a cataconic zombie who completely has no energy to accomplish anything, I've resorted to eating one meal a day because I cannot even muster the energy to eat 3. I know bad diet/lack of exercise compounds all this so I'm trying very hard to have healthy habits etc. but I'm not improving a single bit, every day it just gets noticeably worse.

For the record, I've never taken drugs, rarely drink alcohol, had a more or less healthy lifestyle for my entire life. The only thing I can think of is I live near a construction site and I have a sensitive nose so other than slight nasal inflammation I really can't think of any external factor.

65,"So I've been on Citalopram for 4 years, coming up to the highest dose (40mg) a couple years ago and then at the start of this year I got down to 20mg. I made it my goal to come down or come off them by the end of this year but its nearly December and I've only done half..

67,"I'm taking Pregabalin on a low dose. Sadly, it's not helping much with my anxiety. It's like a drop of water on burning coal. But I noticed that it does kind of interrupt my suicide fantasies for a while, which is *really* weird and scary effect. It's weird because I've wanted to die basically every day since childhood and it provides me with great comfort to think about it (without intention). Antidepressants don't change that really. When I take it I don't feel any changes, except that my fingers get physically warm (they're usually icy cold as everyone I touch knows), and my skin feels warm in general. I've never been drunk or high as far as I know, so I can't compare it with anything.

I reduced the dose again. I already feel guilty. I'm just sitting here thinking whether I should throw it all away or not. I know it seems silly, but I'm scared of the side effects, of possible withdrawals, and I'm scared of addiction and being judged for it. It makes me feel like a criminal. On the other hand I'm not really scared of suicide ideation. People can't judge me for it, because it's my thoughts and my body. and because no one needs to know.

I tried dating a wonderful girl. I broke up with her because I can't stop changing my mindset. I get scared about decisions and honestly haven't made a solid decision in a long time. We still talked and hung out everyday after the breakup. Last night she told me we can't talk because of her controlling family. She's my fucking neighbor.

 I'm constantly wanting to run away. Cut ties. Burn bridges. I don't even think I love my family. They don't treat me bad but I get angry and frustrated and annoyed and insecure around them. When they are home I can't be myself. I turn into a shell of tension.

 I'm afraid of taking medicine after a bad bad experience with Paxil. I also stopped taking my seizure medication and honestly I feel in control about them. Talking out of auras is the new black.

 My insomnia keeps me awake more frequently now. I've been on a long break from school but that doesn't mean I have been doing what needs to be done. What the fuck happened to November? Life moves too fast for me. 

What happened to who I used to be before my anxiety started? I would never kill myself because I view it as selfish, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to die. My brain doesn't feel like my own sometimes and I have consciously viewed negative thoughts coming into my brain and forcing my opinion to change. I think it's the reason I broke up with her. I remember the thought coming out of the side of my head and me mentally fighting it. I'm afraid it is Schizophrenia but it could just be my anxiety.

I've been on lamotrigine since May, started at 25mg. Got put up to 50mg in August and went up again to 75mg two weeks ago. When I started taking them (and every increase since) I've experienced extreme nausea, vertigo, shakes, lucid nightmares, migraines for anything from a few days to weeks (increases with dosage)
I got a rash on my stomach along with cold/flu like symptoms, and the rest of it (^) and told to stop taking them over the weekend by NHS emergency staff. Yesterday my GP told me to go back to 50mg and since taking the lower dose last night it's the worst it's been. Its like my body didnt finish adjusting to 75mg and now its freaking out that its lower again. I've been sick multiple times, I can't stand up right.

I'm really not sure what I can do in this situation. The messages along with another question she asked my mum earlier today made me think that she was being quite serious.

She has had some anxiety issues, for sure. She tells me about it sometimes, so it's not like it's suddenly out of nowhere that she's acting this way. However, things had never escalated to this level of seriousness before. I'm also not sure if I should tell my parents since she doesn't really trust them.

I don't really have a contact number for her housemates or colleagues either.

It's been spiraling this year after losing family and possessions to a divorce, a relocation to my hometown with high hopes of reconnecting with old friends, having those hopes dashed when I realized my friends were moved, alcoholics, dead or meth-ed up.  I'm working 6 or 7 days a week 10 or 12 hours a day, but this week busy season has hit, so it's now 7 days every week 12 to 14 hours a day until new year and the GF is asleep by the time I get home and at work when I wake up for work.  She is not supportive.  She is a good person, but very self-centered and not one to give a hug or a kind word to me if I am stressed out... she would just go away and come back when I was fun to be around again.  I'm extra stressed because leaving for treatment is going to make my social environment even worse at work, since any day one of us misses the rest have to work even longer.

The past few days I've been shaking and crying uncontrollably at work and home, and after decades of pain I began to try to reach out to professionals.  While at work I called 24 phone numbers from the list my insurance company provided and told everyone I spoke to it was a mental health crisis and I was crying most of the time.  They were all ready to leap to assist... but only if I was ready to kill, otherwise it wasn't an emergency at all.   Some of the numbers weren't mental health care providers, some were closed for weeks, some were in another state, most weren't taking new patients, some didn't have voicemail, it was a very frustrating process.  I was finally able to get an appointment to see a psychiatrist in a few weeks, a counselor in a day or two, and I spoke to a counselor on the phone for a few minutes who was nice but about as helpful as any random kind old lady I met on the street would be if I told her I was hurting... sweet and caring but not very useful.  I don't know what I expected.  I called in sick to work and I'm going to an urgent care facility as soon as they open hoping they can dope me up so I can't feel anything for a few weeks until I can see an expert.

In June, I ended a contractual job that I loved and decided to take on a work from home night shift job. It was hell. I don’t really know exactly what it was about it, but I remembered crying on the weekends because my body would feel terrible or how I would dread to go to work each night. I cannot explain it, but it is like there was this dark shadow looming over me everyday I went to work and try as I might to fight it, it would deep through the cracks of the mental box I’ve placed it in. Anyways, I was there for about 2 1/2 months before I found out I got a day time job (corporate) in the old place I worked at, but with a completely different job description. When I started, I felt so overwhelmed by the task at hand and my boss reprimanded me 8 days in and told me that I may not be fit for the job based on my performance. I feel so incompetent because I still barely understand half the stuff I’m doing. I’m now four weeks in, but everyday I feel like a ball of anxiety. I have a hard time sleeping even though I work overtime trying to catch up (no pay, of course, cause it’s me who is slow). I find myself crying a lot and having difficulty breathing the night before and during the commute to work. I’m constantly in an extremely sullen mood. I hate myself for feeling this way because I know how lucky I am to even have a job, to have a home, to have an understanding family. However as much as I try to push this panic, anxiety, and sadness away, it finds it way back to me everyday and I do not know how to make it stop. I want it to go away. How do I make this stop?

I don’t really have time to seek professional help until I return home. I was wondering if there were any sites I could visit online where I could speak to a counselor?

I realize this isn’t a permanent fix to my problem. I have been in a bad place for a while now, and have been too nervous to bring it up to my friends and family. I plan on speaking to my family about it when I return home in order to receive the help I need, I just need a little help right now.

I apologize if this isn’t the correct place for this post, and I know I should have dealt with my problems sooner. It’s just really scary, ya know?

97,"I’ve been on Zoloft for a few weeks, it’s been great, I’ve been less temperamental, I think clearly, I feel great. A few days ago that started going down hill; I felt sad for no reason again, thoughts of suicide (not contemplating it, just thinking about it, I’m not going to kill my self), etc. I thought it was just stress because the semester is about to end, but today something pretty bizarre happened. 

I was going to leave for my class, I got dressed and looked at myself in my full length mirror, then I zoned out. I was staring at myself in the mirror, bags under my eyes, my skin was extremely pale... I just stared and stared at myself. It didn’t even feel like that was me. I felt like I was floating out of my body, then my vision went slightly dull, and my face looked old and rotted, as if I were a dead corpse. After this I very quickly came back to reality, and I’ve been fine since (just freaked out).

98,"I'm from the US, NY specifically. So my friend's Mom just recently completely snapped and we have absolutely no clue what is going on here. She had said she was getting depressed and stressed because of work (and approaching the busiest time of the year for her working 6 days a week), having to watch her grandchild after work, and having to care for her husband. Her doctor gave her new medicine to try to help with the depression.

A few weeks after starting the new medication, she told my friend that she was going to check herself into emergency and my friend talked her out of it as she seemed fine. The next day, she took the car and got into an accident and said she was trying to kill herself, so she got mental health arrested.

The past week she has been in the psych ward for evaluation. She has days where she's completely fine and acts like herself and days where she refuses to take meds and doesn't want to see anybody. I don't have any idea what is going on here. She had to be strapped down to the bed at one point and then she had a seizure, but all of the medical tests came back fine.

Does anybody have any experience with this and can offer some help? I just want to figure out what this could possibly be as my friend has to possibly get family leave to take care of her Dad in the meantime and the doctors at the hospital have no clue what to do with her Mom.

(Fast forward to now) I started back to counseling this summer following my first serious car wreck and it really sent me on this wave of emotion... so I made the decision to go back. Well I go through the local university’s clinic w/ Master’s students basically being monitored and practically applying everything they’ve learned. And I only went for 2 semesters but they said to me a couple sessions ago they think I’m doing well and have decided to terminate my current need to continue attending. 

I have said this 1,000 times by now but being Bi Polar and living a LIFE w/ mental illness I know counseling will be a revolving door for me, and that’s OKAY! As long as I am able to be self-aware enough to say when.

100,"Since starting school this year, my doctor and I have discussed the possibility of me having persistent depressive disorder, fka dysthymic disorder. I've felt irritable and grumpier since I started grad school last year, which drove me to seek help via therapy. I found a lot of the insignificant things my classmates did to be really annoying or irritating to the point where I'd actively avoid going to school (which is very unlike me). After a string of really bad days where I didn't want to get out of bed or leave my apartment, my doctor and I decided that I should start Prozac. I was very apprehensive to start a new drug, but I'm so glad I did; I've felt a lot better since beginning it about a month and a half ago. My irritability is much lower, I feel less worried about school and life in general, and I am generally more pleasant to be around (I think, lol).

My one complaint about this drug, though, is a lack of motivation or urgency. I used to thrive on this feeling of anxiety or worry to get through school and study efficiently. I described it as a cold wash of fear that shoots up my spine; that doesn't happen to me anymore. I have a hard time motivating myself to do work or make flashcards or work on any of the study strategies I used to have before beginning Prozac. I've talked to my doctor about this, and it's a common side effect of the drug. My dosage is the minimum therapeutic dose for Prozac, so I can't go any lower.

My question for this subreddit is what strategies you have to keep motivated. There is a part of my brain that knows I need to do work and has a small sense of urgency, but overall I feel so unmotivated and almost too calm. My roommate (who is in the same program as I am) actually weaned herself off of the SSRI she was on because she was struggling academically. I feel like Prozac overall has been so positive for me, so I don't necessarily want to go off it just yet, but I'm really feeling like I'm struggling to keep up the academic success I once had.

For about 4 years now I can’t think of a single instance where I’ve felt happy. Of course I’ve been exited about stuff and I laugh a lot, but I can’t physically feel happiness. The way I feel feelings is by physically feeling them. I remember once I got so embarrassed that I could feel an immense pressure of discomfort shooting though me, and when I’m truly sad it sits in my chest, however I can’t remember feeling the tightening of my chest when I’m happy like I used to. It makes me feel empty and it’s so so tiering. I’m afraid of sharing this because I don’t want people to tell me it’s normal, I don’t know how I would be able to deal with it if this is something normal.
The only times I’ve felt anything close to the same physical feeling was the one time I was drunk, the time I had a huge crush on my friend and I used to have a celebrity crush on one of my favorite celebrities. However, it’s not like I can be drunk or in love all of the time just to feel like I’m actually happy.

     For the first time in my life I think I'm recognizing the warning signs of instability. I know that something is not right, and I feel like I'm drowning. My thoughts are racing and I'm on the verge of tears all the time recently. As much as this sucks, and as much as I don't want to deal with this anymore, I feel like this is progress in reality. 
     I've explained how I'm feeling to my husband. Per his advice I reached out to my sister. She had the idea of listening to a podcast, so I searched for one on bipolar disorder. I found what I was looking for and listened to a women tell her story. I found that there were more similarities than differences in our experiences. It was cathartic to realize that I am not alone in the feelings and patterns that I experience.
      I'm not sure why, but my favorite song (Epiphany by Staind) seems particularly relevant. It is also one of my favorite songs to sing.
  
""Your words to me just a whisper
Your face is so unclear
I try to pay attention
Your words just disappear

Oh
'Cause it's always raining in my head
Oh
Forget all the things I should have said

So I speak to you in riddles
'Cause my words get in my way

I smoke the whole thing to my head
And feel it wash away
'Cause I can't take anymore of this
I wanna come apart
Or dig myself a little hole
Inside your precious heart

Oh
'Cause it's always raining in my head
Oh
Forget all the things I should have said

I am nothing more than
A little boy inside
That cries out for attention,
Yet I always try to hide
'Cause I talk to you like children,
Though I don't know how I feel
But I know I'll do the right thing
If the right thing is revealed

'Cause it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said.""

     It is very telling that this is my favorite song. I know what it's like to have constant rain in my mind. Sometimes I can put it aside for extended periods of time, but it is always there in the background. I often feel like that little boy. Trapped and scared. I'm forever stuck in the prison that is my mind. All I want is to get away from it somehow. I want to make that little boy mature and become a successful human being. Most of the time I have no access to him. Because I can't access him I can't communicate effectively and I can't comprehend the things that I need to. Everyone tries to help but I can't determine and tell them what I need. I don't even know what I need.
     I have a therapy appointment with my husband later. Hopefully that will help. Aside from my husband I need my animals. They are such an amazing comfort. Hopefully tonight will be cathartic. As always, my goal is to stop this from happening. Hopefully I can cut it off at the pass. Until then I sit at my desk quietly letting tears fall down my face. Anyway, thanks for listening.

Losing friends as i never talk to anyone social anxiety bs

Feel uselss as i cannot fulfil my basic human aim to reproduce as a shitty circumcision means i have LITERALLY NO sensation on my penis


Im short, like VERY short for 17, both parents are tall but i sm short, constantly say shit about it and thay are saying im a late boomer or some BS (i say medical issue)

Being short is my body dysmorphia as i now feel inferior to everyone 

Nobody says anything about my sucidal and depressive comments fuck those cunts

Dont want to come forward myself as my parents say shit about depressed people and i have no motvation and am too paranoid to do so

Paranoia: news is fucking with me, constantly hearing depressive stuff just makes me feel so insgnificant and makes we want to kill myself and am doing loads of stuff to do with hiding my ip and shit (paranoia) over my data despite having done nothing wrong

Too lazy to help myself as i lack any motivations, i have no life goal, a single conversation could persuade me to change my courses from studying engineering to whatever as i dont care aboht shit

I feel like a useless worker bee to the system sith the significance of a dust molecule, is there any point to me being alive anore?

I just want somebody to care for me ie a significant ofher who i can talk to idc anymore

I am hoping to die in a road traffic accident to at least help to stop people saying i was depressed, i dont want to be remembered for being a depressed retard

Eg. I cross roads hoping to be hit, not looking, crossing whenever in the hope of being hit and dying and a bunch of other risky stuff

I feel no emotions anymore other that crippling dmptyness, uselessness and hatred towards others,i think i am jelous for them not wanting to die despite what i have is magnitudes better than them

I feel no empathy anymore, i am destroying my famial relationships as they think i am a cunt

I feel no guily nor social understandig for others who tf cares, next point

The reasons i am trying to not kill myself:

- dont want to inconvenience others like family and freinds
- dont want people to say they were close to me or whatever once i die trying to be all on their high horses using my death to seem like a good person i know you understand how people are about these things tryig to look good by saying we were close or some other BS
- addicted to masturbating despite little sensation
- got to finish my videogames, RDR2 keeping me alive
- Too lazy, yeah really, i cant put in the effort to do so
- i am scared to die, what is beyond? Nothing? Kind of counter to my morbid obsessions huh?
- Mainly, i dont want people i hate to mourn me, i know the school will do some bs mourn day as they are those kind of fags and i do not want to become some kind of mental health symbol for my school which i hate as that is exactly what they will do

I was able to keep hanging on, trying to improve myself by setting myself a goal by intentionally having a crush on a girl i know, this was the best way that i was able to hold on as it was actually a reason for me to hold on and to get over this; noshit, she gets a boyfriend, im not trying to be a niceguy or anything, its just that because of this i now know the goal i set is unattainble and i no longer have a reason that i set to get over this

I hate reddit, i wrote so much more indepth but lost it so i rewrote this garbage as all the effort i put in for a post is gone now

I WANT TO BE HIT BY A CAR PLEASE KILL ME NOTHING IS WORTH IT ANYMORE, MY LIFE IS ON A DOWNWARD SLOPE I WILL NEVER HAVE ANY IMPACT AND WILL BE FORGOTTEN LIKE ANY OTHER INSIGNIFICANT SPEC. 

(Dw i wont try to be a mass murderer or rapist or some bs to be noticed; i may not have much empathy but what i do miraculusly have left is morals, id not steal, hurt or kill, i think things like rape are heanus etc, but  i managed to hold onto my love for animals so at least this is a shred of hope)

Hope anyone can help! Thanks",27Nov2018,1
130,"I'm pretty there's something wrong with me. I'm laughing and talking about very dark things, with no remorse. It's not a way of dealing with sadness, because as I said, I have no remorse. I don't care when I see X, Y and Z were killed, etc. I'm diagnosed with Depression. I don't think I'd ever hurt someone, though. What illness (if it is one) am I describing? ",27Nov2018,1
131,"So for the past couple years I've had a lot issues regarding mood stability. I've never really been a medication guy other than the occasional antibiotic when I was sick. However, it's getting to the point where some of my shittier moods are affecting my work and really just taking a toll on my general well being. My mom and I have been talking and one of her suggestions was seeing a therapist and maybe being prescribed medication. I don't know much about medication regarding mental health and was hoping that some of y'all could let me know about your experience with prescriptions and whether or not y'all thought it was beneficial. 

Thanks in advance. ",27Nov2018,1
132,"So I made a post earlier so an update?

Within an hour of taking 50mg of sertraline I started to feel like head feel tingly. I massaged it and felt a rush of euphoria like you would on drugs. Pupils were dilated (have been all day, even my boyfriend noticed). Laughing a lot and feeling really good. My jaw was going wild too. It felt like a small version of an mdma high. I ended up having clammy, cold hands but my body felt warm. Temperature was changing slightly though.

This was all within an hour and a half.

The rest of the day I've just noticed clenched jaw, slightly sleepy, dry mouth, a little forgetful and pupils still dilated. Other than that I feel normal?

I've been searching the internet and I can't find anyone talk about this. I had a mini up and then a mini comedown? 

I also ended up ringing 111 because during the temperature changes of my body I convinced myself I had serotonin syndrome. They were quite confused at what I was telling them too.

TLDR: has anyone else has a slight come up and slight come down on their first day on anti depressants?",27Nov2018,1
133,"I was diagnosed with bipolar years ago and sought treatment due to my crippling depression. I was ill to a point I couldn't function. I was put on medication and mellowed out a lot. It was nice and I felt like I could finally live life and enjoy it for what it was.

My dad has been going through financial problems and his insurance kicked myself and other family members from it, causing me to stop taking my medication as I cant afford it out of pocket. My therapist was kind enough that even though I was unable to see her due to the issue, she still let me update her through text on what was going on and would give me advice and help. The problem is getting fixed soon and I'll be hopefully able to get on my meds and see her again within the next few weeks.

I've been paying close attention to my mental state and watching for any fluctuations. I've been relatively stable beyond some breakdowns here and there, but lately I've been obsession over an interest of mine. Like, to a point it's all I talk about, think about, dream about, etc. This isnt a new phenomena to me as I used to get like this all the time in highschool. Sure here and there I'd kinda get latched onto something and let it consume me, but not to the point I'm at now.

I never used to think anything of obsessing over stuff because I always just viewed it as who I am. It doesnt FEEL like it harms me. When I'm spending money on it I'm rational and dont just throw away cash.

Anyway I brought it up to my therapist in passing because I wondered if it had to do with being off my medication. She asked when we have a session next because it may be another issue (she brought up OCD and autism) entirely.

I've seen my therapist for almost two years now and trust her. But I'm scared that if I'm diagnosed with one of these things I may be pressured by others to seek treatment. Since the only way this really effects me is through personal relationships (I've learned to just obsess to strangers over the internet rather than my friends) I dont understand why I'd need treatment.

I guess the reason I made this post is because I want to hear from people who've been diagnosed with OCD and how they treat it, or just their experience with the condition in general.",27Nov2018,1
134,I've never been diagnosed with anxiety or been to a psychologist/psychiatrist but I feel like I'm a pretty anxious person. And a couple times recently I've just felt like sudden spike of anxiety not triggered by anything nothing serious I'll just be chilling and my heart rate rases a little and I just get this feeling like something's wrong but I don't know what. These episodes if you would call it that only last no more than 10 seconds.,27Nov2018,1
135,"I had a “bad trip” at a festival almost 2 years go and since then, I’ve had panic attacks and now get triggered at festivals. The panic attacks are to me an after shock because I was with a really abusive man for a while...  I was with him when I had the bad trip... 

Anyways I have suppressed how much that instance freaked me out. I felt that day I was going to die. I was with abusive guy all day as he screamed at me I needed to find party favors (mdma) or he would be angry. He even told me if I didn’t find it then I didn’t love him. I didn’t realize it was abusive though , don’t ask me why

Anyways I finally went and saw my Doctor and she asked me / made me fill a form out about depression and anxiety ... and then I finally just broke down and told her I never had it this bad until I had a bad trip at a festival with an abusive guy

She was so helpful and is connecting me with a specialist
I told her I’m trying t deal with things alone and she said sometimes we need To accept we can’t and get some help ... 

Just sharing I made one step finally to healing ",27Nov2018,1
136,"Super condensed background info: I remember being sad since I was young. It’s been years. And it’s not just sad, it’s wanting to commit suicide. I’ve struggled with self harm and one time took a ton of pills and had to go to the hospital, not sure if I consider it an attempt. 

Anyway, I’m super bad at hygiene and also my weight fluctuates A LOT so idk if these could be symptoms of a mental illness? I gain an extreme amount of interest in something and then a week later it’s gone. I loose the feeling of wanting to do what I’m usually passionate for. Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me, literally. My emotions are SO unbelievably strong sometimes. Like something will trigger me and I’ll become VERY suicidal and want to literally kill myself right there. I feel emotions in extremes, there’s not really a middle ground. I physically struggle to cry when I feel the need to/want to. Very sporadically I’ll hear auditory hallucinations (clear and distinct knocking on doors, one time a woman asked me if I was okay, etc.) I also have these crazy ideas like my soul is connected to the weather or that my paper is connected to someone’s screen when I’m writing. I just believe that crap. So what does this all mean? I’m trying to make sense of it and if someone thinks it something specific it would be GREATLY appreciated if you could held me.

137,"I'm scared. I'm afraid. I'm scared of what's to come. I'm afraid of the future. 

When I started high school (high school in my country is a three year education that you start when you are 16 and you finish when you are 19) in 2016 I was a sixteen year old teenager with a bright look on my future. I was excited to see what the new chapter in my life was going to bring. My grades were good and an engineer was what I was going to become. Paul and I had been friends for years and together we were going to make lots of new friends, be cooler than ever, go to parties etc. We couldn't wait to start living the high school life. A year goes by, we had lots of friends, we partied, aced all tests, all A:s and B:s. Life was easy. Summer holidays came and the summer was a nice break from the studying, I forgot to mention that but I studied a lot... It was fun though.

On September 5th, everything changed. School had recently started and I was super unmotivated. That night I talked to my friend Lewis, we discussed how school and the educational system did not bring us anything. It wasn't going to teach us life, or how to become successful. School is for the people who wants to be your average Joe. It's a back up. It was a waste of time. After that day I was a different person. I couldn't care less about school, my grades were declining rapidly and I was just not motivated. Sleep was something I often sacrificed to do whatever else I was doing. All my teachers were asking me what was going on but I had no answer, I didn't know. Skipping school became part of my routine. In December, the girl I had been seeing and sleeping with a couple of times got together with my best friend Paul. That didn't make things better and in March 2017 I was a wreck. My life consisted of; British Rock n roll, weed and cocaine. I don't know if depression is the right way to put it. I didn't feel depressed, I just figured maybe life is just not for me. Maybe I just don't enjoy life and that's it. Suicide was always in the back of my head but I didn't want to go through with it because I didn't want my family to suffer. 

Today I'm 18 and things are better, but they are far from good. I still have no motivation for school and therefore bad grades. I still do cocaine from time to time if I feel like I need a confidence boost. I don't know what to do with my life. 

I'm scared. I'm afraid. I'm scared of what's to come. I'm afraid of the future. 


Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm not asking for help but always open to it. I just wanted to share this with someone. ",27Nov2018,1
138,"i am currently in high school, and I am lonely and depressed. My parents refuse to buy me a phone, they think it will spoil me. So basically, I have no real way of maintaining and actual friendship in high school, especially since i don't really live near anyone. I have spent these past 4 years watching all my peers have their fun, while I did almost nothing noteworthy. I have never been to prom, homecoming, or even had a girlfriend. My parents really like controlling me, and now I don't know what to do. I have no support system, no one to talk to. Last year, I ended up self harming. I caught myself before I was too late, but not before I left several deep, raised scars on both my arms. I am ashamed that I resorted to cutting and regret it, but I have no one to talk to. I am starting to slack off on academics, I don't have to mental energy to keep interacting with people or care about anything any more. I have only 2 passions- working out and reading. If it weren't for those outlets, I would probably keep self harming. I can't even seek professional help because of career reasons, and my parents would fucking kill me. does anyone have any advice? i don't know if I can keep going like this. all i know is that in the next 2 years if I am still crying myself to sleep with no one to talk to, i will be in serious trouble.",27Nov2018,1
139,"I'm the kind of teenage who will like to have a close group of friends and sit in the back of the class and get on with my work. I'm well known for being quite pushing and hard on myself but not too a serious level
What I'm gonna say now is something I'm only saying as im stiol trying to piece togethet why or how but here goes nothing

On Sunday night i attemempted what i beleive(im unsure of my own details) was suicide by overdosing and a couple hours later when i thought that had failed i started cutting.

Only after that did i realise what i had done and proceded to use an online child safety line to say what i had done to myself. minutes later 2 policemen(they thiught i was armed as the valler was quite vague) and 2 paramedics arrived at the door asking for me , i was admitted into hospital and in the morning deemed medically fit but know im starting the phycological side of things and to be honest i'm scared as fuck and i dont know what to do, this all just feels like a bad dream .

Please, someone , help me get my shit together and get over this
