2,"I have a therapist. I try to be honest but I have so much going on. He suggested a get a case worker for my health stuff which will help if it works. 

I tend to use metaphor when talking about how I feel. I am in a sea of gray or in a well of despair or between a rock and hard place. Nothing resolves my internal tension but avoiding stressors doesn't wind me up. 

I actually want to be dead. Not in a going to hurt myself sense but in a it would be better not to be here sense. If I knew a painless guaranteed way I would take it. 

I want to tell my therapist that next week but I don't know how. We are in the same line of work so I worry. ",29Apr2018,1,
3,"I can't hold self esteem because I know I can't save everyone for good. There's no way to save all the organisms living on the world. The only ways I've thought of were cloning immortal copies of one person who loves nature or wiping out all of the humans. 
I just can't take my eyes off the animals suffering and dying every second of my life. I just can't see a world where there is no bloodshed.
I can't even cry to let it out. It feels like I forgot how to. I see way beyond what I need to see, and it hurts me. I can't seem to just look away, even for a second, and so I feel I've become emotionally numb. Is this some kind of extreme teenage depression or something else?",29Apr2018,2,

5,"I've already made reddit posts about this but i just really want and need some more sincere people giving me honest opinions. I'm not sure what exactly will make me feel better but maybe yall might have an idea? 

I have a history of sexual assault. in high school my dads employee manipulated me into sex and threatened me so i wouldn't tell anyone. after two years i told my dad and my dad refuses to fire him and actually still hangs out with him regularly as a friend. I love my dad and don't know how to handle the person who is supposed to protect me hanging out with this man who did this awful thing to me. 

I also was recently raped \(in the last month\) by someone I thought I could trust. It's broken me. I'm anxious all of the time, I can't be with my friends without freaking out and feeling uncomfortable, and I cry all the time. I had to tell his wife about it and they have three kids so I feel like I've ruined a family. I also have been admitted to a mental hospital twice in the last month for suicidal thoughts and plans. The first time I got out and I was much worse once I left because my boyfriend found out what happened and didn't take it well. He's now decided to stick by me but I had to be admitted again because I had fantasies of revenge and killing myself and I tried to steal my parents' guns. My second time in the mental hospital was awful, one of the techs was high and fighting with patients and another tech FaceTimed me and other patient's faces to her friend even though this is a huge HIPAA violation. I reported these incidents and the nursing staff accused me of lying and said if I said that tech was high then they would just lie and say I was high. I ended up getting the attention of some higher ups and they're launching an invesigation but anyway this time in the mental hospital made me much worse and didn't help me at all. I'm still feeling suicidal and if I bring it up to my friends all they say is generic ""it gets better"" and ""you have so much to live for"" which doesn't help the rage and betrayal and disgust I feel. I can't tell my therapist how bad my thoughts are or she will call the police and send me right back to that awful hospital. I see a psychiatrist and am on medication but it doesn't help much either. I'm afraid I'll feel like this forever and I've reached out to my parents, my friends, healthcare professionals, everyone I can think of and I feel like this is a dead end and I'm never going to get better.

6,"so I'm 18 and the last time I truly lived my life was when I was 10. This was the period in which I would hang out with my friends and overall lived in a 'normal' life.  Yeah, I had OCD tendencies when I was younger but it did not formally hit until middle school- so when I was 11 years old.

For years now, I have basically lived my life googling random things on my computer and having to keep on bookmarking everything. I'm basically on my computer all day long-I honestly, I have no life (had to take a medical leave from college because of OCD). Yes, I tried random activities such as track/cross country, color guard, acting class, theater, volunteering and more but I was never really present. 
 
I do not know what it is like to live a 'normal' life or what it entails as my life for so long as been OCD. Currently, I am on a waitlist for residential but I'm scared what my future entails without OCD. It's kind of funny because as much as I hate my OCD, it's also a part of me.",29Apr2018,1,
7,"I’ve been having this problem over the last few months where whatever I do, I can’t seem to get any satisfaction or relief from it. It’s not like I have stopped enjoying things that I like doing, I still love doing those. Its satisfaction and relief from stupid tasks that bother me more than they should

For example when I want to mail a letter and everything is set and ready to be sent, I start second guessing. I reopen the envelope and re read the contents over and over again but I am never content with it even though it’s perfectly fine. I have to go against my instinct to recheck everything and reopen envelopes after envelopes and wasting stamps.

It’s only until it’s sent and out of my control that the feeling goes away.

Anyone else feel like this or know how to remedy it?

11,"TLDR: SO of 8 months is having serious delusions of grandeur, believing he can dismantle the entire world by way of social media. I have no idea what to do and need help!!

I have been seriously involved with my SO for about 8 months. We happened very fast, and out of financial necessity more than anything. 3 weeks after meeting, hurricane Harvey made landfall, leaving both of us without a place to live and he without a car. We decided that it would be wiser to cohabitate, save our money, get him a car and a new job, (he despises his current occupation), and try to figure out this relationship thing between us in the process.     

That worked for about 2 weeks, until I lost my job due to repercussions from hurricane Harvey, which forced the owner of the small repossession business I was working for to dissolve the Houston branch.     

I immediately began driving for Uber. Since he was still without a car and works 50 miles away from home, it was more cost effective for me to drop SO off at work at night, Uber around town for 7 or so hours, pick him up from work in the morning, then head home to get some sleep. I also worked on his two days off during the week in order to make enough money to keep us financially afloat. We did this for about 2 months until I ran into a medical problem necessitating surgery, and therefore a hefty hospital bill, which we had to scrape together and which I lost a week's worth of work out for recovery as a result. This caused us to fall behind on my car note, and my car was repossessed a month later when I couldn't pay the overdue balance and my current balance at the same time. (They refused to work with me on a payment plan.) Once it was repossessed, it would have cost over $2300 to get it out, which was money we didn't have, and there was no realistic way for us to attain such an amount. For the next 3 months, I struggled to find any side jobs I could do for extra money while trying to figure out how to get SO to and from work every day. I applied to every job I possibly could, with no results. We barely escaped eviction, twice. We fell several months behind on several bills as well as my credit card payments, (furthering the destruction of my rapidly crumbling credit score).     

During this time, my severe depression and anxiety was going absolutely haywire under all of the stress, and this is when I started noticing some things about my SO that began to concern me. He had previously told me that he, too, had experienced depression and has anxiety as well, so when I felt my sanity begin to slip, I tried to talk to him about it, attempting to explain what steps he could take to help keep me from becoming too wrapped up in my depressive episode. When I brought up the subject, though, he took it as an insult, calling me selfish and inconsiderate of his feelings and all that he had been doing to keep a roof over our heads. He went on a rampage, yelling and stomping through the apartment, throwing things around, just basically having a temper tantrum. As someone who has already survived an abusive relationship, I am unfortunately conditioned to a certain response, and began to apologize profusely for making him angry. I ignored the overwhelming anxiety as best as I could until he left for work and I could allow myself to break down. The next morning when he returned from work, he apologized for getting so upset, but held his stance on the fact that it was still my fault.     

This kind of thing has happened several more times; I bring up a subject to talk to him about, and he turns the tables on me and makes me feel invalidated, ending with me apologizing for being selfish and inconsiderate through tears, followed by panic attacks and depression that lasts days, sometimes all week.   

In February I attained a decent job, and began working again, bringing in steady money. In the past 2 months, I have made enough to buy a cheap car for SO, (which broke down 2 weeks ago and has still not been fixed despite throwing over $500 under the hood), and catch up on almost all of our remaining bills. I made a budget to get us back on track, and made goals for us to reach for. I still need a car, and we need to move somewhere closer to work. (I work 10 minutes from SO's job, so now both of us drive 50 miles ONE WAY from our current apartment.)     

While I began trying to focus on these goals, SO began acting more erratic, becoming more and more entranced in his phone, specifically in social media. His dream is to be a photographer and writer, and he uses Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook to connect with other like-minded people and to promote his work, something which I have tried my best to encourage, even going so far as to buy him a nice DSLR camera and trying to set up a legit photography website, with corresponding business cards to disperse, as well as a blog for him to write. I offered free photoshoots to some of my friends in order to build his portfolio and gain experience, but every time I scheduled a shoot, he would come up with an excuse not to go. I tried to do the shoots myself, (and failed), two times and ended up canceling the rest. He never even looked at the website or the blog, and the box of business cards is collecting dust, unopened.    

 It seemed that the more SO became engrossed in his phone, the more he ignored the things around him, including me. He has lost all interest in intimacy and sex, saying he has too much on his mind. He began having fits of anger and would rant about how he has been ""saying these things for years but nobody believe[d]"" him, and that ""everyone has always called me crazy, but I'm not! This proves it! People out there are noticing!""   

When I asked him to extrapolate on what he meant, he went on a tangent about all sorts of things ranging from how fucked up this world is, and how we are killing the earth, all the way to how famous musicians and rappers are using his exact words in songs, things that he has been saying for years, and how he's tired of other people making money off of his writing.      

A couple of weeks later, the rants evolved into how he is speaking up and how he won't be silent any longer, and that he is going to ""do this right"" and make so much money that we will never have to worry about it ever again, and that no one, NO ONE, will hold him back! 

He has also told me a few times now that famous people, Rick Ross in particular, have told him that he needs to ""get out there"", and to ""do it right"" so SO can ""make it big"".     

 SO also believes that famous people have also told him that what SO is saying online is ""causing a stir"", and that it's ""drawing attention"" to SO, and that he is inevitably going to piss off the wrong, influential and crooked people, and they are going to kill him, and possibly me since I am affiliated with him.       

He mentioned that he wants to buy a firearm for protection from them.      

A couple weeks ago, he told me that he caused the entire city of Houston to stay at home during the weekend of the Astros and Rockets games, noting that there weren't many cars out on the road that weekend, all because of what he had been saying online.     

 A few days ago, he straight face told me that Nikki Manaj just put out a song, just that day, that she wrote about him and his online influence.       

He has also mentioned, on several occasions, that people online are calling him a God, that ""they all want me to be something I'm not"", and how ""they want to take what I'm saying and twist it and dissect it, and pick out the things they agree with and use the rest against me"". He also believes that ""they"", (whoever ""they"" are), want him to completely dismantle the government, to destroy the status quo because it is such a wrecked system.      

As of this morning, SO told me that he ""single-handedly caused the cesation of the Korean war"", that the reason North and South Korea have come to an historic agreement is because of everything that SO has been saying online this week about how we need to be agreeing to peace in order to save the world instead of fighting amongst ourselves.      

He constantly talks about how much smarter he is than anyone else on this planet, and how no one can keep up with the mental leaps that his mind makes, and that this is the reason why he doesn't tell anyone about it because no one else understands what he's going through, and because they don't understand, they will all tell him he's crazy when he KNOWS he's not, and he refuses to be convinced that he is crazy ever again. (He claims his ex-wife used to twist things he said to make him feel crazy, and he vows never to be manipulated like that ever again.)      

This morning, he sat in bed next to me, listening to music through his headphones and crying. He told me that he is at an impasse, that he has to make a decision about what to do from here on, that this particular decision will result in a world war to end all wars, that millions of people will die, that their blood will be on his hands because of what he is saying online, and that this is a very heavy burden to have on his shoulders.       

At this point, I am scared. I have no idea what is going on with him, and any time I try to bring it up, he goes off on these raging tirades that just get more and more impossible and surreal the longer they go on.      

 I have tried calling all of the mental health resources I could find online, but they are all closed until Monday.      

I don't know where else to turn.       

Help me, Reddit, please... I am worried and scared, and stuck in a situation I can't get out of with someone who truly believes he is the smartest human alive, he can control the entire world with his cell phone, and that he is going to cause the breakdown of the entire world as we know it through use of social media, and that it will cause the deaths of millions.       

I don't know what else to do.

12,"Hey guys, if you don't mind I could use the perspective of someone who's been there or someone who knows better than me.

This is about me and my friend, both girls in college. She is severely depressed, has been for most of her teenage years and is very deep in that hole. I know I can't lift her out of it, I can offer to find her a therapist, make the calls, get her there and back but in the end; the decision to give it a chance needs to be hers. 

We've spoken about it a lot of times, why she doesn't want to go to therapy and is afraid it won't work. She's scared she's been feeling this way for too long, that it's too late to get help; that she deserves to feel this way because she's responsible for all of it, that she's not worth someone's efforts, that she doesn't deserve to feel any better. She knows all the ins and outs of how it's medical, chemical, how she's being unfair to herself and her view is skewed, how all her reasons for not wanting to give it a chance are just excuses. It's free in my country, you don't even have to commit to it right away because there's 5 zero-commitment sessions with every new therapist. She knows all this. And sometimes it feels like she's actually hearing me and actually considering it, but in the end she always shuts down.

There's this truly beautiful amazing person who is battling all this shit she doesn't deserve and I wish I could take it all away from her but I can't. I would move the planet to get her help if she allowed me, but so far she won't. Her life is so far from over and there's so many wonderful things out there and I know therapy doesn't help everyone, but most people benefit from it and she hasn't even tried. She is not actively suicidal but essentially just waiting for her life to be over. I'm sure you all know the feeling. And it hurts so much to watch because she doesn't deserve any of it, she doesn't deserve the way she's been treated and the way she treats herself and there is no objective reason holding her back, just that she's her own worst enemy. I know it's depression protecting itself. Some days I feel like I'm talking only to the depression part, and not to her underneath at all. Some days she actually listens. But I don't know what to say anymore. 

If you've ever been in her situation and did end up deciding to do something about it, what was it that needed to click for you? What changed? If you're currently in her situation, what would you *want* to hear? Even if it won't be any kind of wake-up call, what can I say to make it any more bearable for even just a moment? I want to be there for her and I know I can't make that decision for her and if she's not ready she's not ready but I'm not ready to give up hope. ",29Apr2018,2,
13,"This woman in my fathers life is extremely controlling and manipulative. She is late 30’s and still acts like she is a 13 year old. She influenced my father to kick me out when I was very suicidal with bad depression. Her mental state is unhealthy as my dad stated when they broke up a couple years ago. She has abused my father before. When I did live there previously, I would hear a sound that sounded like a hard slap. It was late one night and I heard her yelling at my dad. Then I heard a slapping sound that followed my dad saying: “I don’t deserve this abuse.” So it sounded like she was throwing a tantrum. Some of her family don’t speak to her sometimes to the point where they moved to a different state! My problem as of now is that I’m trying to retrieve my (expensive) personal belongings from my dads house. I have been trying for almost two weeks now. I contacted my dad only for a text he replied saying that “he has a concern about giving it to me.” I understand that he did pay for it and all but I worked for it so he could help pay for it. I am scared what they are both going to say to me about it. I need advice and what I could do about my situation.

14,"I feel like I'm always weighed down by a lead blanket, not really living my life.  I've always been shy and reserved and never felt like I could be myself around anyone, even my wife and 3 teen kids.   I'm on anti-depression and ADD meds which have helped in many practical ways, but the depression meds have reduced the highs just as much as they've reduced the lows.  I have to have them to function though.   Going way back, my mom died of cancer when I was 12 and my dad became an alcoholic not long after.   He was functional and provided for me in every physical way but had nothing to give emotionally.  For all of my adult life, I'd say a fourth of ""me"" has just been going through life waiting for it to be over.   I've never been suicidal, but I can rationalize the feeling that 48 is long enough for a life to last and, for example,  I'd be at peace if the plane I was in was going down or I was in some other unavoidable situation.   I would say that the thing that connects me most to the world is my feelings of pain and loneliness.  Knowing that those lowest feelings and experiences have been felt in every civilization for as long as humans have been around is comforting and connecting in a way.

My family loves me and wants me to be my best and be connected and present with them.  I don't think t hey can't help me because I've been neglectful in the relationships, and it's all too emotional, but I don't know what kind of help I need.

This ends up giving me anxiety and my driving becomes unsteady and I think I'm going to hit whatever is next to me. It takes all my power not to swerve. No matter how much I tell myself to just breathe, have confidence and don't pay attention to the side, I just cant. Why is this? Anybody have a similar issue?

16,"First fyi, I'd like to tell y'all some things about me. At the end of May I'll be 23, I have a 3yo daughter and the most wonderful boyfriend. I've been through a shit ton to get to where I'm at right now. Most of it bad, but it was all a learning experience for me. Even in the first grade, I was being sent to talk to someone. At 14 I was sent to an alternative school because the teachers and staff at my school had been told that I was suicidal. Subsequently I ended up in a mental hospital and a ward of the state. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety with suicidal tendencies. A few years later when I was 17, my new doctor wanted to retest me to make sure I got the right meds, I was then eventually diagnosed with manic depression  with social anxiety. Now on to the real story!

I can't stand psychiatrists or therapists or counselors, and yes this is all from experience. And because of my medical back ground, from what I'm actually certified for to what has personally happened to me or close family members, I don't trust chemically made or synthetically made drugs. I've been on so many different prescriptions I can barely remember them all. Basically I'm like the bubble boy, except I'm not a male nor do I live in a bubble. I'm just constantly fighting one type of sickness or another. But back to my original point in all of this. Because of my aversion to most modern medicine, I kinda have more limited options on ways of dealing with everything. So I thought maybe this sub could at least hear me out so that I can try and relieve some of the daily stress. Now I self medicate, and not just with that herb you're thinking of. I use lavender, bay leaves, tea, honey, etc. etc. But sometimes you just need someone to talk to about everything with someone that understands and empathizes with you. That's why I am here. For me, it is a daily struggle to keep myself in check, especially in public. There have been so many times where friends and family have point out to me that I'm being a bitch or overly excited or what ever. I can't control it all the time, it's like I there in my head but it's not me moving my body, it's not me talking, it's not me it's happening to. Then after I gain control again I feel so bad for what I've done, but I can never really make it up. I'm a very hard person to deal with on a daily basis. Eventually almost everyone gives up on me and moves on. I'm a very sketchy person now, all though I used to not be. I can still almost blend into normal society too. But even so, I'm constantly feeling like I'm being talked about, or people are staring at me. I'm never truly comfortable anywhere. Yet I still crave human interaction and I still have to function normally. ",29Apr2018,1,

I am male, USA. I very likely have a depression and mania disorder, not exactly fully diagnosed as I haven't been thoroughly evaluated.

23,"Hello Reddit. It's been a very long time since I've been here, haha. I have a problem that I am facing, and I wondered if some of the incredible people here might be able to give me advice.

Ok, lets start.

I have suffered from general **depression**/**anxiety**/fears of everything/lack of goals for the last ten years. During that time I managed to make it through university by coasting part time, but was **unable to look for work**. This is a problem, because it means that I **don't have the option of going back to school**. I wound up going on **disability payments** and subsisting at an extremely minimal level for several years, but it was obvious something needed to give. I then spent six months teaching English in China because I'd read it was something people could do that was low effort low skill, but I basically hated it and was counting down the days until I could go home.

Right now I'm living in Japan staying with a friend and doing just enough work for her to cover the cost of my food, but it is an obviously precarious situation. I love some aspects of Japan and think that being here for a while could be good for my mental health, but I do not love teaching English, at least from the limited experience I have of it, and I don't think I'll ever be able to cope with the Japanese work ethic. I simply **don't have the physical stamina to work 40 hours** per week.

So now I'm in a conundrum. I have about nine months during which I will have structure and a few hours every day to work on my goals. After that, I can either have a job in Japan that gives a visa (and is thus necessarily full time), or I go back to Canada and go back on welfare/disability. If I'm not actively doing *something* structured, though, I can only see the progress I've made on my mental health going backwards.

So now I ask myself: what can I focus my limited energies on that will lead to a better life?

* 1) When I am resting, **I like to read**, and I am in the process of trying to write a web novel. I was raised on books and think that with practice I could probably get decently good. I also have a lot of interesting experiences I can draw from. Obviously web novel writing isn't going to pay much unless something crazy happens, but there *are* ways to **make writing pay**... I just don't know what they are or how to get them. I think I might enjoy editing, since I have done that for free with some of the stories I read, and I think if I could make editing people's stories into a way to earn my keep, I might love that. Ok, laugh if you want :) Writing jobs are very **low demand**, and finding freelance jobs has the prerequisite of learning how to market myself, which might be extremely difficult or impossible for me.

* 2) My first time in post secondary was in video game design. That was over ten years ago, I was pretty mediocre at it, and I quickly learned that I don't have the personality needed to get jobs in that industry (I'm an extreme introvert and thus can't effectively network). However, based on my experience then, I think that if I put effort into **learning computer programming**, I might eventually get to a point where I could do work for pay and not hate my life. I have the advantage of being **able to focus** extremely hard for extremely long periods of time, and I read that computer programming is a field that could be **well suited both to my personality and to my anxiety**. Jobs in *that* field are in higher demand and pay better than writing jobs, and with some experience under my belt I might be able to negotiate part time. It might take a few years since I'd have to teach myself, but I have Canada's social safety net to keep me alive while I get there. If the end goal is worth obtaining, I think I could motivate myself, but it would be **extremely difficult**.

* 3) Since I am in Japan and do like it here, **learning Japanese** is an option. I wouldn't be able to get to a decent level in nine months without the money to pay for school, but if I put my life on hold for a few years, I could do that on my own while teaching English (blech), although my physical stamina would be an issue. After a few years of hating my life, I might eventually get to the level where I could do translation work, which I think would be awesome. Or I could use my native English ability to do other sorts of work in Japan, such as doing writing for video game companies or editing for translation companies... I haven't yet found any of those kinds of jobs, but I am assured they do exist.

I have three terrible baskets full of holes, and only enough eggs to half-fill one of them. Which one should I choose? If I have a goal, I believe I can work towards it, but I am anxious about choosing the wrong one again.

33,"Hello,


I have a history of ill mental health but until after I'd finished abusing drugs it was limited to depression. Throughout the time I abused drugs, I didn't care. I had lost all feeling, no longer was I depressed because I knew it wasn't long before I could get high again.
My drugs of choice were MDMA and LSD, I would sometimes smoke cannabis. I never drank, that would lead to depression. 


My delusional thoughts are quite acute, but when they come they come hard. I've been at work a few times and had to go and cry to myself in a corner or the bathroom and try to overcome my thoughts and feelings.
I'll explain a few instances, which are in order from least recent to most recent:


I was at home with some friends over, we're just chilling and my dog walks in. One of my friends start petting my dog, calling him a scruffy dog in the tone in which one would speak to a dog to excite it. You know the one.
I felt like he was calling me scruffy and took it really personally, wondering why he would say that to me. This was probably the first of many to come. This was quite some time ago, almost a year and a half ago. Since then I've had other experiences but unfortunately I can't remember them all.


I'm walking through work and a colleague starts a conversation, it starts off quite well with a simple how's things and the weather pretty generic textbook conversation, any way we somehow get onto the subject of the homeless guy nearby that frequents outside our place of work. He then mentions how some of them can be con artists and finished by saying ""you know who's genuine"" He did say something immediately before that sentence too which struck me as well but I can't remember...
At this point my mind was convinced he was no longer speaking of the homeless person but actually speaking about me, to himself as if to say I'm not genuine. I walked off thinking why did he just say that to me? I was hurt, although I understand why he would say that. I find I'm a half empty vessel at times, people aren't my strong point. I found a secluded place to cry and try to compose myself.


I'm sat at a table with my girlfriend, her mother and her partner. My girlfriend starts speaking about her dad, mentioning he's quite dominant in a conversation. Her mother replies with how he only wants to speak about things he's interested in and doesn't care about anything else.
At this point I'm convinced she's actually just said that about me, so I'm sat struggling to compensate by talking across the table while other people are speaking to prove her wrong. I was unable to speak, as per usual my inability to perform socially got the best of me and in this situation made me feel worse.


I struggle socially as I'm not sure when it's my turn to speak or if I should at all, whether or not what I'm saying is worthy of someones ears. So I don't really socialize any more, the last time I tried to make friends with some people from work we went out and I actually came home and cried to myself every time because I knew my efforts were futile.


So I seclude myself, I am not on social media, I don't speak to my family although they care for me I'm afraid to connect. I don't have friends, or at least the ones I do have I just ignore these days, texts or calls just get rejected. I hate passing anyone I know in the street, does one just say hello or converse further? If I just say hello I worry they're offended I didn't say more. If I say more I'm worried they actually don't care or are judging anything I'm saying.


I'll end on this, although I'm troubled and hate the way my mind affects me. I'm depressed about my life and the fact I feel I'm stuck in a dead end job with no prospects, I can't help but love life. I'm not suicidal in fact I never want to die, I love life despite its struggles. I just wish I could conquer my own life.

- act out different characters in front of the mirror

- narrate out loud when doing tasks as if I am making YouTube videos

- I have multiple inner voices that seem to pop in and out of my thoughts like I have turrets but thoughts. Like they will say random things, like ""88888 and with two friends"" etc. Sometimes they are very negative though.

- I shake or make noises as sometimes it feels like I get a sudden burst of energy that I can't control. Or say out loud things like ""add 99cents"" randomly

- there was a period where I thought at night that I could go into this lucid state where these ""beings"" told me they would help me reach ""the top"" so I could help them with their plans

- I get fixated on crazy ideas. Lately it has been packing my grocery cart perfectly and hoping the store clerk notices it, previously it was I had this strong to make electromagnetic devices and take them out to the dessert. Don't know why.

- someone stole a 5$ ball from my front yard. I drive around the streets for an hour or so at night  looking for who stole it. I'm trying to setup a camera now in case they come back.

- sometimes I think I see things out of the corner of my eye but I can always seem find what it might be. A fly, or a bug. But the initial thing I thought I saw was bigger than a fly or bug. But I can never out my finger on what I saw, so it might be a fly..

37,"Hello all. Just wanted to post here to get some wisdom from this sub.

The world health organisation state that mental illness reduces life expectancy at a rate of between 5 to 25 years. Now, I determine that factors such as increase in smoking, drugs, alcohol and other factors come into play for this population...but naturally so will co-morbidity (health problems alongside the mental illness). However, I wonder how many of these additional medical problems were caused by taking SSRIs and their side effects. Meaning, how much of this decline in life expectancy is caused directly by medication?

St John’s Wort seems to be an effective choice for those with mild to moderate depression. However, some studies have shown a correlation between irreparable eye damage and SJW. It seems to be the ingredient ‘Hypercin’ that is to blame (and it’s reactivity to sunlight).

Just wondered how people feel about these points? I took SJW and I felt it made a massive difference. Unfortunately the prospect of irreparable eye damage was too much of a risk for me, so I stopped. I do feel that taking SSRI’s could be an option for me at some point, but cutting 25 years off my life seems like a huge price to pay.

Also: does anyone know of a Hypercin-free version of SJW that I could try? Would like to try that before SSRIs if I can. I’ve heard they exist but can’t seem to find any.",29Apr2018,3,

41,"Just for the record, I do not have any children and do not spend significant time around any children. Also, I would never act on these thoughts. I did take care of my significant others sisters kid when she was 2 months to 2 years. We were basically like the nanny for 7-8 hours a day. And I freakin loved her to death and she loved me. I was very caring to her. And I’ve also spent time around my nephew. And I love l him to death as well, never laid a hand on them in a bad way and never would. But I do have thoughts of hurting children. I never had thoughts of hurting my nephew or the little girl I took care of specifically, ever. This is just more general thoughts. I feel like I would get satisfaction out of slapping a kid around. Making a kid cry and when they start crying, hitting them more. And I’m not talking about hitting them to death or anything (im not that sick) but just upsetting them really bad. My thoughts have gone as far as to imagining hitting a kid, making them cry, hitting them again, telling them to shut the hell up and then putting them in a closet and shutting the door to scare them. Or covering up their mouth with my hand where they can’t breathe for like 20’seconds and making them cry and squirm. I know this sounds really bad but I’m just being honest and I’m wondering what is wrong with me even though I’d never do these things. I know many people have thoughts of killing people and would never act on it and stuff like that, so how abnormal are my thoughts? I was just watching videos online and came across the apparently kid when he was on the Ellen show. He’s so cute, funny and just a happy kid. But I couldn’t help but think about how I would love to hit him and tell him to shut the hell up. I started wondering how such a happy kid would react to being abused. Please don’t be too hard on me here. Like I said, I’ve never abused a child and I never would. Oh and to clarify the age I’ve fantasized about hurting is like 2 to 5. Not a baby but not a kid past 3rd or 4th grade. Also if y’all are being completely honest, have y’all had any similar thoughts? And if not, have y’all had any other disturbing thoughts or urges? Thank you. 

Oh and I read something online on a post website like this about the urge to hurt something cute. I think that is part of my urge here. Hence the ages 2-5. I love kids so much and kids are so freakin cute so I think that is a factor. I don’t know why I would wanna hurt something cute but that stood out to me. And then someone said they should substitute the word cute with helpless and that hit the nail on the head. I’ve found about 3 other posts of people asking this same question so at least I know I’m not alone. People also talk about hurting animals but that’s never been an issue for me. ",29Apr2018,0,

My next couple thoughts are always along the lines of why aren't they dead yet. Which makes me feel like a terrible person.

43,"Hi, hope this is the right place for this. 
to make a long story short, I met a girl I knew from two years ago last night. We were semester buddies in a high school dual credit program and ended up going to the same college. We wanted to catch up and hang out a little bit, so we went to Starbucks. For the first 2 hours, we chatted about grades, fun local places to go, puppies, and terrible CGI movies. Very normal and innocent conversations. We begin talking about relationships, and I mention I’ve had a boyfriend for 3 1/2 years. She then shows me pictures of a guy she likes. Out of no where, she talks about how she is going to crush him while they are fucking. I laugh and make a joke. Then she says “if the sex isn’t good, I’m leaving him. Then I’m going to fuck his dad. I’ve always wanted to ruin a family.”
I know it sounds like a joke, you had to be there to get the full serious effect of what she was saying. I look at her and say “what??” And she says “if you need to be somewhere, you should leave.” And I do.
I came here because I wanted to get a second opinion on this. Does this sudden turn sound like it could be a mental health issue? She is also a psych major, so I am guessing she is interested in that due to her own struggles. I really want to understand the situation better, and I don’t think it was just someone being weird. I sensed some pain or hostility for sure.

52,"HORRIBLE memory loss (I can barely remember what happened yesterday let alone anything that happened years ago), AWFUL concentration, I barely talk to anyone, can’t understand anything that’s explained to me and can’t consume information. I just can’t take this anymore. I need help and I don’t know what to do. Please hear me out:

I’m currently 14 years old, turning 15 in May. I used to live in United States up until 2 and a half years ago, then certain situations caused my mom, my brother and I to move over to a country called Costa Rica. I had to get used to a lot of things, like culture, language (everyone speaks Spanish here, I think I’m starting to speak it better than English which sucks) etc but I got accustomed to it after a while, and I even made some friends. I got transferred over to this semi-private catholic school about a year ago (which I’m still attending) and that’s when problems began to arise. I still didn’t know how to interact with Costa Rican’s much so I was usually quiet and didn’t have many friends. People began to talk to me behind my back saying that I had a problem, which was really frustrating. But then I met this one guy and another guy who used to live in the states too and things got better..The school year ended in November (school year is from February - November) and I ended up passing the year with very high grades. I thought things were going to get better, but boy was I wrong.

I’ve already explained this on multiple threads in an attempt to seek help and I’m tired of explaining it completely so I’ll make a short summary:

-It started in December, I couldn’t understand things. Sure, when somebody would ask me a question I could respond normally but I felt like I wasn’t processing the information correctly.

-When 9th grade began this February, I sort of got cured in a sense that I could finally think somewhat normally again to do work in school.

-Then, around March 20th, my symptoms came back and got WORSE. I can’t understand anything properly, I feel like everything that’s happened in my life from the past including things from yesterday were nothing but a dream and I can barely remember them, I’ve forgotten almost everything from the states, like how is that possible?!?! Back in November I could still remember everything. 

-This April, my symptoms have gotten worse. I’ve lost most of if not all of my creativity (My passion always used to be making YouTube videos. I have a comedy channel with a lot of subs but I haven’t uploaded in a while because I feel like I simply can’t) I can’t form any coherent thoughts in my mind, my memory is close to gone, my social skills have gotten even worse to the point where the only two friends I have in my school are starting to not talk much with me (probably because they think I’m acting weird) and I barely talk to the friends I made at my old school now (cause I used to socialize with them a lot). Right now it’s 9:51 am, I woke up feeling completely spaced out, and because of that the only thing I feel is a rush of adrenaline, fear and anxiety right now. I’m having trouble writing this, and it’s taking a lot of effort to do so. 

-It hasn’t affected me academically yet since all of this is pretty recent, but we’ve been given a few group assignments and I have trouble contributing on the projects. I think that my classmates feel like they’re doing all the work, and whenever I work on a project with my friend, he treats me like a kid with special needs and has to tell me to work. I wasn’t like this last year, last year I helped out on assignments a lot and got good grades. But with this thing, I feel like my grades are going to fall.

-I’ve looked up a few posts online and I’ve found some people who are going through the same thing, but they’re all 19-30 years old and they say that they’ve lost everything. It makes me wonder what is going to become of me if this keeps up, it could be life threatening.

When I woke up feeling all disoriented today, I thought to myself “This is the last straw.” I want to tell my mom TODAY about what I’m going through. I feel like it’s some type of disorder, like depersonalization disorder, anxiety or something. The reason I didn’t tell her as soon as it started was because she’s stressed enough already, I love her and I don’t want to worry her. I need help from you guys, what do you guys think?

The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life. The survey may take between 30-40 minutes to complete. Your responses to the survey items will be anonymous and kept confidential. Clicking the “SURVEY” link below will take you to a page asking you to read through a consent form explaining the purpose of this research, the content of the survey, the type of questions you will be asked, the amount of time it may take to complete the survey, and the risks and benefits of your participation. At the end of the form you can click “AGREE” to consent to the use of the answers you provide and to begin completing the survey. Thank you for your time and interest.

55,"Hi, apologise first if these kind of posts are not okay.

I'm after advice on where to start looking for medical help or possible diagnoses even if it's that nothing is wrong with me.

I'm based in the UK, come from a family with a variety of mental health issues and have had concerns of myself having issues since a teenager.
It is getting to the point where it is starting to affect my personal life almost daily.
 
I'm guessing going to the GP/doctor is the only route to go to start getting help, but if I'm honest I really feel I cannot trust them at all and have been blown off by them seeking help as a teenager to the point where I feel they don't believe me or take my concerns seriously.

I'm not sure what other routes are available?",29Apr2018,1,
56,"I don't know if this is going to make sense to anyone, but here it goes:

So I live alone. Like no chance ever of someone walking in on me alone.  Yet there are times during my day where I start to do weird shit and am 100 percent aware I am doing the weird shit.

Like I'll start talking to myself (not normal for me) in half thoughts or saying things like ""you're fine"" or ""get a grip"" over and over to my self. Or I'll check to see if my apartment door is locked repeatedly even though I know it is, or I'll lay on my bedroom or kitchen floor for an hour or two at a time. Pacing, hiding in my closet, constantly keep looking out my window, etc. You get the picture.

The thing is the entire time I am doing these things I know deep down they aren't rational and warrant no reason to be doing them. I don't even tell my psych or therapist about them because the behaviors are embarrassing to me. When I am out in public I am largely able to get a grip on things other than being abhorrently spacey and need concentrate really hard on things.

It just feels like I am faking these behaviors to myself to convince myself I have deeper rooted problems with my depression which might not even exist.

Now I do get sleep paralysis, tactile and sometimes visual hallucinations, and my lizard brain obviously sometimes can't tell the difference in things. But even then I know deep down those things aren't real.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about?",29Apr2018,2,
57,"My really close friend, after having an excessively stressful week, talked to me extensively about what was going on with her last night.  She said that in regards to emotion, she feels everything, but nothing at the same time.  Her whole year has been going from on stressful activity to the next, with no breaks or hesitation.  She doesn’t say no to anything, and therefore gets swamped by piles and piles of responsibilities...

Our conversation last night really scared me, there were times where it felt I was talking to a robot, giving short, uninterested answers to my heart-felt insight and support.  I understand this is a personal problem, and therefore I can’t directly help, but I really care for her, and I’m concerned that if she doesn’t realise the load she has that she will end up hurting herself. 

After doing some research last night, I bought a book called The Energy Bus. I know she loves books and I’ve heard it to be an extraordinary positive, and uplifting book that lets you see meaning in your life.

I realise that I truly don’t have any experience or training on mental issues, but I want to be ready to support her in any way possible.  Any help or comments that any have, would be greatly appreciated. ",29Apr2018,1,

Every year, more than 800,000 people die from suicide. Thats one every 40 seconds.

Lately I've been having allot of overwhelming unreasonable feelings. I've done a pretty good job at keeping it under control though and doing my best not to act on these feelings but last night I slipped up.  
My friend had asked if I was available and I said no because I'd been told I had a family thing. It turned out the family thing was actually not when I thought it was so I actually was available. I texted my friend to tell her but she didn't see it until it was too late. 
I found out on snap chat that her and another friend had gone out and I kinda snapped. I called her out and got really upset with her and was just being generally unfair. 
I felt immediately guilty and actually had a bit of a scare with a razor blade. I told my mom right away so I'm safe. 
I talked it out with my friend this morning and It turns out is greatly upset her. I feel awful and I don't trust myself anymore. I acted like a maniac and hurt someone close to me.

I’m a 24-year-old guy from the UK. Over the past few months I’ve been increasingly more and more anxious in the day to day. It starts with my heat ponding, sweating, and just a sense of unease. When I’m like this I find it really hard to just relax and I become very restless. 

Its not getting to the point where when I’m out in public I just feel uncomfortable and my chest gets tight. 

I’ve tried everything! I’m gay, and recent came out to some friends hoping that would help, it didn’t! I took a vacation abroad for a week to relax, that didn’t work. I exercise at home, nope! The old thing that works is booze!

66,"I have been reading a lot about addictions and whatnot lately, and one guy I come across is Gabor Mate who talks about addictions being rooted in trauma experienced as a young child/developmental years.. and addiction for him is defined as anything we partake in compulsively to ease mental pain and ""escape"" - food, drugs, internet, porn, etc.


And this got me thinking.... my early childhood, though it had ups and downs like anyones, was not traumatic.. plain and simple i had a loving family. BUt most people's account I read involve having an abusive mom or dad or absent parent, etc.

For me, I think my trauma started when I became a tween/teen , first entered middle school. I started to be bullied a bit by other boys for ""seeming"" gay, being called ""fag"" etc. And this was at various points throughout middleschool, really. Being called gay and the alienation that resulted from that within my male-peer group. 

This would follow me into highschool with whispers and suspicion of my sexuality and never really being fully accepted by male peers. One experience stands out to me is in how when I was to give a presentation in a class full of jocks, I was nervous that I'd be laughed at, etc. But I said to myself ""nahh, they wouldn't be that cruel, they havent done that to anyone else""... annnnd I was wrong. I was laughed at. Mainly because my voice at the time sounded feminine i think plus just being nervous and my mannerisms. That hurt pretty hard because not only was I laughed at, but I trusted they'd do better and they did not. 

I say all this to say, does this count as trauma? I mean, yes this hurt me and impacted me, but it doesn't seem as bad as many other stories I heard or involve early, early childhood like most. Thoughts? How can I resolve my trauma, these memories if it is indeed so?",29Apr2018,25,

This makes me want to punch him because i didn’t confide in him my sickness in order for him to use it as a punchline. I know I have messed up but damn it makes me mad.

69,"So this started off last summer as me feeling like  something about life was off and everything just felt different and i felt no emotions. At times i just wouldn't feel right and it was distressing but I didn't know how to explain it and it would make me want to be alone and cry. One day I felt rlly bad anxiety and felt like i was going crazy somehow and i actually ended up being taken out of school and I'm doing independent studies rn.

I never heard voices or saw things that weren't there or anything like that. After some googling i began to believe it was depersonalization/derealization.

But now things are somewhat worse because i have these weird thoughts and feelings. It seems like everything about reality is so weird and bizarre to me. It makes no sense to me that we're living on a planet suspended in space and every time i go outside and look at the sky it freaks me out because it seems fake. Just things that I have never given thought to or have been freaked out by now suddenly make me uncomfortable and don't make sense to me. Also i hate being out and about in public because i see other random people and just the fact that there's so many people living in this world and they all have their own personal lives is weird to me. Because i feel like rn my life feels fake, like a movie playing out before my eyes and people in public are like background actors but no, they're real people with their own lives.

One example of reality not making sense to me is i do not understand how cameras and video recording and even talking on the phone is even possible. Like i don't see how its possible to like freeze a moment in time from the past like it blows my mind. or to hear someones voice on the phone who is no where near you. I know it has to do with like light particles and sound waves but those concepts in itself don't make sense to me. And that's like something you can't question, you just have to accept that light particles and sound waves truly exist because we were born into a reality where they do but my mind like won't just accept it and stop questioning it. I have a polaroid camera and I feel like if i ever use it and see an image before my eyes get developed onto a piece of film, i will like have an anxiety attack because it doesn't make sense to me anymore. 

And so many other things about reality just are sooo weird and feel fake to me and it gives me anxiety and a feeling of dread. And I'm questioning why are things the way that they are. I'm scared because I don't know how I'm going to live my whole life like this feeling so weird and disconnected from reality. I'm especially scared because i'm going to be dorming at college in the fall and that in itself is scary but especially since I'm feeling weird. I don't know how imma do it. I really want to get back to normal before then.

The thing is, I haven't had a complete break from reality because I'm aware that these feelings aren't normal. I don't know if this is an extreme case of derealization or something else. I am not having delusions like believing inanimate objects are speaking to me or anything like that.

I did see a psychiatrist and she gave me an antipsychotic, olanzapine and i took only 5mg for like two weeks then stopped because i didn't notice a difference and also didn't rlly see why i needed it because I'm not like hearing voices or anything but do u think i should try it again?

I then switched the another psych who basically didn't even address my weird thoughts and just like blamed this on anxiety from starting college soon but i had these weird feelings before even thinking about college. and she didn't even prescribe anything

but idk what to do man like i want to get back to normal before starting college. but rn all i do is like stay home and do nothing like i don't like leaving my house bc i feel uncomfortable out and about.

do u think i should try the olanzapine again? any other advice? ",29Apr2018,2,
70,"This is probably not as bad as some other people, but i want to empty my heart.

So I am almost done with a school (where you go to when you are 12-17) , with only the central exams remaining. 
And I notice that  I am feeling a little down every day, which is pretty weird for me because I am a happy and optimistic person, that is also why it is bothering me.

Because I am almost done with my school, and everyone is going different paths in half a year, I notice that I am constantly thinking about how it will we, and if I will see everyone. And every song that I listen that can remind me of that time makes me a little sad, even if it is a uplifting song.

72,"This has been going on for about three or four years now, I’ve tried antidepressants (lexapro) and while I feel fine on them, as soon as I wean off of them I remember why I was so miserable. I usually get back on them after a mental meltdown and continue them for six months or so, but as soon as life feels tolerable again I wean off... until the next big trigger kicks me down.

I could go back on them but at this point I’m feeling like I’m just numbing myself so that I can stick around just to appease the people around me. Sticking around, working, paying taxes, feeding myself, fueling my body to move forward in society just for the sake of pleasing those who are close to me. It’s so exhausting, I’m so fucking tired. I had a good run and I’m proud of my achievements, but I have no further goals and no reason to stay.

I have spoken frankly and openly about my views on death and suicide to my partner and no matter how many times I try to explain how I feel in a rational and calm way he gets upset. Rightfully so, I guess, but I wish he would just calmly tell me it’s okay. I want so desperately for someone to say “it’s okay, I know you tried hard. You had a good run and it’s time you rest,”

I don’t perceive death as a bad thing? Society made us perceive death as a sad, bad, terrible thing. But in my mind, the worst way to end a life is by tragic accident, disease, murder, or old age, alone in a home. Choosing to end your life on your own terms, peacefully, when you are ready, seems like one of the most wonderful ways to go. I don’t want to die immediately, as in, tomorrow or the next day. But I would feel so much better knowing I could. That the choice is there and that it’s “okay”.

At the moment, the options for suicide (locally at least) all involve discomfort and pain, and fear. I don’t want to go that way. I don’t want to have to hop through a hoop of sadness and adrenaline and anguish just to get to the other side. It makes me so sad that others seeking the same peace have to cross that traumatic hurdle. 

I suppose it doesn’t matter if you are dead but for the sake of my family, no matter how much they don’t understand it, I want them to know I didn’t suffer and that it’s something I absolutely wanted for myself.

Life feels like a party where I’m slowly edging towards the door and trying to bow out before anyone notices.

I guess... 

I don’t know what I’m trying to achieve by writing this. It just seems like nobody here can relate. Does anyone else feel this way? Is there something I can do to make this all easier? How do I live with myself when it feels like I’m remaining in it for the sake of those who don’t want to deal with my departure?

75,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a child, and it's mostly around success, achievement, fear of failure, etc.  Basically, I travel through life constantly feeling stupid and like I'll die without accomplishing anything.  I've spoken to a therapist without much effect, but I've never talked to my primary doctor about it or taken medication. This all leads to the following question that I've been pondering.

Theoretically, if somebody has been a failure at everything that they have ever tried to do, wouldn't depression be the correct response?  And in that case, what would the effect of antidepressants be?  It seems like if they actually worked at all, they would really just be hiding reality from the user.  Can antidepressants make a person blind to their own failings?  

I understand that there are normal and abnormal responses to trauma such as an injury, death of a loved one, failed relationship, etc.  but what if the depression is stemming from a truly failed life?  Is there a level or duration of depression that is appropriate?  

Sorry I know this has been vague, and maybe the question itself speaks to how my thoughts are spiraling, but I've just been thinking about this recently and wanted some outside thoughts.
