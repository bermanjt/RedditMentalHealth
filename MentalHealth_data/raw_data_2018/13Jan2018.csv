1,"My psychiatrist said they weren't psychotic and then proceeded to give me a prescription for abilify which was $130 for a bottle and I couldn't afford it so I passed. I am planning to make an appointment with him again soon.

I just realized today that whenever I've attempted suicide or harmed myself it was because I had a voice in my head telling me to do it. The reason why I realized it today was because I was getting really anxious. I have a cold and I have no groceries in my house, it's also very bad weather here so I can't go out to get groceries myself due to the combination of illness and weather. So I asked around for some help and no one could help. I felt as if I was running out of time, like if I didn't get the groceries then I would die, and it was making me extremely anxious. I started to freak out and had this voice in my head telling me that my friends didn't care about me at all and thought I was annoying, my boyfriend doesn't love me, and I should just take a bottle of pills and kill myself.

As soon as I realized that was NOT me and not my thought, I stopped it. I was like WOAH, that's a little dramatic. I have tons of time, I got some bread and tuna and spaghetti, I'll survive until I get better. Like holy crap.

Then I was thinking more and how if this were a situation when I was younger I probably would have listened and harmed myself or taken the pills because I listened to this voice back then, probably because I didn't even realize it was a voice. I thought it was just my thoughts.

Today was different though, these are not my thoughts, I have no intentions of doing anything like that, I know my friends care about me and I know my boyfriend loves me. I felt like the world was going to end and everything was like earthquake armageddon all around me.",13Jan2018,3
2,"For the last 2 of years I have been feeling rather mentally dull / slow / tired. I believe that this is the root cause of all my current frustration and depression. I have other health issues to deal with, but my mind is what is most important for me. Before all this, I was sure that if I just though things out clearly, I could handle any problem came my way, make tough decisions and follow them through and be happy. But now I feel I am mentally stunted and have lost the tools that I relied. I think my situation is similar to brainfog so I just wanted to share.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I haven't had a good rest in a long while. I never wake up refreshed, there is always this mild headache pushing from all sides, and mentally I am tired and slow. Usually at this point you'd say a bit more rest/sleep will sort it all out - simple, it's just that simple. But no, regardless of how much rest I have I still wake up the same. This is constant through out the day, every day. Exercising sort of gives a flushed feeling in the head for while, as if everything is about to loosening up, but there is always a ceiling. Its like my brain is a tight tense fist that forgot how to unfurl. I am pretty used to the headache and I can live with that, but mentally something is not right.

&amp;nbsp;

My mind always feels so empty yet crowded at the same time. When I am reading, I don't think I really understand what I just read or can even recall it properly after a while. Same with listening. Its like there isn't enough space to store everything for analysis and so anything non-recent gets purged from the workspace. Recalling anything also feels so disconnected - I don't know how I'm recalling it and am not confident if I am recalling it correctly. Memories are there, but it just feels so faint. I have lost confidence that I can learn anything new.

&amp;nbsp;

It feels like I can no longer fully formulate ideas or goals in my head. For example, normally before I start writing I would have a general outline of what I want to write in my head, but now I can't even recall the previous sentence I though of. And for problem solving, in general I can't think too many steps ahead, it's like everything other than the my current active though just fades away. Thinking / focusing just takes so much more active effort.

&amp;nbsp;

My thoughts don't even stimulate anything anymore - it's like throwing a rock into a still lake, but instead of ripples the lake just swallows the the rock with no sound and that's the end. There is just no feedback. For a long time there hasn't been anything really I wanted to do, there is just things I needed to do and I did them. I have lost the sense of determination needed to persevere - there is nothing to urge me on, nothing is so important that I cannot put it off for another day or take the easy way out. I feel like I have lost sight from my analytical / emotional self; I am just wondering around in a foggy landscape and I am navigating with muscle memory rather than purpose.

&amp;nbsp;

And noise in general just bothers me so much more that before. I guess my mind is so empty that it latches on to any noise it finds and that the default thing that I can think of. When all of these symptoms were starting, I would hear the noise get louder and louder to the point that it would piss me off. Thankfully that does not happen anymore - the noise level remains the same but just get clearer. You'd think that calming the mind / mindfulness would help, but nope I have tinnitus. I can block off every external distractions, but then if it is too quite the ringing starts to get noticeable and my mind again latches onto that. I initially blamed not being able to think clearly on the tinnitus, which had also started same time, but now I think these are separate issues.

&amp;nbsp;

I would normally be much frustrated and depressed when I start to recall all this, but right now I am rather calm. I think the meds is numbing me a bit and I have sort of given up hope of it ever getting better. A while ago, when my depression was under control I started getting hopeful that this all just the anti-depressant's side effects. I don't know why but I was so sure - I knew all these symptoms were there before going on the meds, but I was so optimistic that I no longer needed the meds and that getting off of it would bring back my mental clarity. I stopped taking my meds but nothing improved, just my reaction got worse - frustration just brew and brewed, and I didn't realize when I started getting depressed all over again. I am back on meds which has helped with the depression, and ever since then I think I have accepted the fact that this how it's going to be. No happy ending in sight but I don't think this is the end of the world (for now).

&amp;nbsp;

Typing all this out I feel rather odd right now, surreal ? I am just too calm right now, I probably will start to panic / despair pretty soon.

8,"Firstly, I am from the United States. Specifically, the northeast. 

I get impulses to cry for odd reasons which, most of the time actually end in me crying. Just a bit ago I cried after trying to talk to my mom while my dad was on the phone, something I know I shouldn’t do but I’m the kind to act before thinking, which is something I’m trying to fix. I got an instinct to go into my room and then, once I got into my room to hide, I cried silently. This is something I’ve always done and it really messes with me by causing shame. 

Another example is me getting in trouble in school, which fortunately doesn’t happen nearly as much anymore. This would end in having the administrators and teachers talk to me about my behavior in general and the fact that it needs to stop and that they know better of me. This is even more possible if it’s a parent involved meeting and I can see that either or both of my parents is/are upset which, come to think of it is always the case. I will notice myself developing tears and sometimes they actually leave my eyes, most of the time in reality. Often, they stay in place and I wait for them to leave, knowing that whoever is in the room can see me welling up causing me to feel shame. This has especially occurred if they happened to be a male administrator or my father which I now think that, that always has been the case. Also, I know that it can be very helpful professionals and people who have gone through the same or similar situations, so I will mention that I am a male who is nearly eighteen years old. 

I have a long list of personal issues caused majorly by myself in the past and I’ve patched up most of the ones I can think of consciously. I am still having issues with things like the one I just explained to you, which I am pretty sure are subconscious. My question is, is this a condition, or rather is it a symptom (maybe even a strong symptom) of something deeper like a mental illness or mental disorder? I just want to fix it so that I can stop dealing with the shame of it and not have to actually hide it (even though it occurs less often now). 

Thank you anyone, for your help. 

Edit: in the file I probably should have said “symptom of a mental illness or disorder”. ",13Jan2018,1

Hey everyone,

So for the first time in my life I am considering suicide. But it's not an emotional response, I'm not anxious, or emotionally unstable or anything like that. I'm just really really exhausted and I think I've come to the end of the line for me. 


Here is some backstory:

I am estranged from my entire family, they all suffer from drug addictions and or severe mental health issues. I've been labeled the black sheep of my family because I refused to go on government assistance and leech of society. My family thought that was a sign that I held them in contempt and stopped talking to me. 


I haven't spoken to my mother In 7 years when she abandon me when i was 17 years old. She just up and left one day and I haven't seen her since. 


However, even with the family issues it never really bothered me before. I've always been a very independent person. I grew up being adopted when I was young, then went back with my birth mother when I was a little older, then went into the system, then went with my dad, then went with my mom again, then was homeless for a bit, then back with my mom and then she left. 

So I've developed a really strong sense of independence.

I've been pretty happy most of my life except last year. 


Everything went to hell last year for me. 


1. I co-owned a company last year in my dream city(San Francisco). I was set up to make 100k plus in the year 2017 but at the end of 2016 I was cut out of the business by my business partner. Dropped from the company, stripped of everything, lost all my money and had to leave San Francisco with my tail between my legs. I headed back down to my home town. This absolutely broke my heart, not only because I lost a lot of money but because I had been dreaming of living in San Francisco since I was 6 years old. And I had it, i had the money I had the apartment and I lost it all. 


2. I had to pick up a menial, back breaking job in a warehouse 60 hours a week to support myself and my new wife. I went from expecting 100k/yr with my own business to making minimum wage lifting boxes 9 hours a day. I am not college educated, and I only have a GED. My company ownership was 100% self taught entrepreneurship. 

3. My wife is an undocumented immigrant, and after speaking with a lawyer(that we can't afford) it looks like she might not ever be able to get citizenship based on the way she entered this country. So my 8 year relationship with her may have to end because of some ridiculous laws that I have zero control over. Everything is just so perfectly wrong. If she had come to this country 6 months earlier than she did we would be good, if she came under ANY other circumstance than we would be good. But because she missed DACA by 6 months and came in a way that results a life time ban. We are completely screwed. 

4. I am 70 pounds over weight. I used to be incredibly fit, like 4:50/mile fit. When I was young I attracted the prettiest girls in school, I was charming, I was fit, I was confident. Now, I am 70 pounds over weight from stress eating and working 100 plus hours a week(warehouse job plus starting another company) 


5. I am very aggressively loosing my hair, not because of stress but because of MPB. I'm 23 years old and will probably be completely bald in about a year. 


6. I am $20,000 in debt. At one point I had a 770 credit score, now I am sitting at $20,000 in debt as I spent the last year trying to keep myself afloat while I tried to rebuild my company and keep food on the table, the rent paid and everything else. 

7. Broke a tooth and then needed 5k in dental work. Root canals, crown, fillings etc. No Insurance ofcourse because  I can't afford $400 a month. This also lead to an immense, and I mean an immense amount of pain. I went almost a month of needing a root canal, I'm talking the worst pain I'd ever experienced. I didn't have $1200 to get it fixed and government health insurance(medical) had a 6 month waitlist for local dentists. And they didn't cover root canals. 
 
8. Slept 4-5 hours a night for 6 months straight, clocking in over 100 hours a week of work. 60 hours of that being warehouse work and the other 40 being entrepreneurial stuff trying to rebuild my company. 


Over the last year I would look at myself in the mirror and see my hair falling out/ 70lbs overweight before I would head off to my warehouse job and I would promise myself that it would be okay because I was going to make it. I wasn't like my family, I wasn't a looser, I wasn't going to let this job suck the soul out of me. I wasn't going to let myself go bald, I was going to make money, see a doctor, get myself straightened out. I told myself that every day and before I knew it a year had passed and I'm not even an inch closer to where I want to be. 

I had all these dreams of getting back into shape, saving my hair, rebuilding my company, getting my wife her green card so we can travel together, I was going to fix everything. 



Well, that all leads me to here. I'm exhausted, I'm bald, I'm fat, I'm tired and I'm just over it in every conceivable way. I'm not mad, I'm not emotional, I'm not compulsive. I'm just so so so tired. 


I would see a doctor about this, but you know, #trumpcare

14,"My boyfriend and I are going in to our last year of highschool.
Last year was very difficult and he struggled quite a bit. He's neither fantastic nor bad at school, but a lot of things have lead him to feel like he really is horrible and that everything will be horrible.
He struggles to get the work done. He tells me that he can be sitting there telling himself to do it and he just feels unable to. My thoughts is that there's some sort of an anxiety about it.
He has no confidence in his ability to complete the classes anymore and, even where he did do well, he feels like it was just luck or the teachers turning a blind eye to where he went wrong. He loses motivation to the point where he won't or can't do the work and doesn't like what work he does and i guess just feels really discouraged because of it.
He hates school and homework and says he can't handle it anymore. Because it's just really hurting and stressing him. Things happen and he starts to hate everything about himself, and just doesn't seem to know how to fix it. He doesn't feel like he's getting anywhere or improving, and thinks that he's getting worse and is going to fail this year. He says he wants to give up, or just leave and get a job instead, or other things involving physically hurting himself (i don't think he would actually but I'm still wary) that I know are just an expression of stress but still really worry me. On top of this all he has family issues and a lot of responsibilities at home because of it which already cause a lot of stress. He's struggling to enjoy anything because of it too. He's been to the school wellbeing because of it and nothing seems to help.
Maybe it seems silly. But it's really a big issue. We haven't started the semester even and just  the homework and the thought of it has brought up all these feelings for him again.

I myself have mental illness issues with anxiety and depression. Which certainly doesn't help him... he knows about it, but I don't often go into details or talk much about it unless i really need to as i don't want him to worry about me and i dont want him to know what I'm feeling. I have times where that gets really bad, and i know i won't be able to handle his issues and stress well on top of everything.
Despite my issues i try to and want to do everything i can to support him. One thing I'm adamant about is helping friends or loved ones through their issues so that they hopefully dont have to feel anything that i ever do, and so they know that I'm there for them. I try to talk to him rationally about how he is feeling and these issues and let him know that at the moment he really is just anticipating the worst and that things wont actually be that bad, we'll get through it, things like that.
We're at our last year but he really doesn't feel like he can do it, i don't know if he wants to at this point.
I try to be as encouraging and understanding as i can be but at the same time i get just as worried and stressed and dont really know whether or not we can do it. 

School is generally fine for me. Extremely stressful, but I've usually managed to be able to push myself with my anxiety and get the work done. And i hate doing well or decently with it when he feels like this.

I just don't know what to do. I can be here for him, i can keep going how i am with supporting him. But I'm just as unsure and half the time i feel like I'm saying things to encourage myself too. Sometimes i really dont know what to say or what to do.

I don't know how to change his view and get his mind out of this state of remembering all the bad feelings and thinking that it'll be the same this year.  It probably won't be much better this year really... but i need to be optimistic about it because saying that yes it is going to be horrible is just going to make things worse.",13Jan2018,1

16,"Hello guys, this is gonna be one long post. I am a 21 years old, female. And I suffer from spectrum of anxiety disorders, extreme generalized, mild social etc. I was about to turn 13 going 12 when I discovered that I suffered from nervousness which would manifest itself physically. When it started getting worse, I knew that it wasn't 'normal'. I get extremely uncomfortable when somebody looks at me, I have trouble eating at public places, even passing strangers while walking gets me super uncomfortable, like the idea of dying almost sounds more comfortable than being in those uncomfortable situations. God, Am I fucking weak!!!?  I had pretty rough time dealing with having to go to school, like it was extremely bad. I did try to confess my problems with my mother but she turned the whole situation around to 'why can't you be normal like the other kids?they have friends, they go out, they are smart' and what not. Same thing happened when she went ahead to address my problem to her sisters (my aunts and uncles), since we were one close-knit family or so had I thought. Now, what happened is that whenever they used to come visit us, they'd sit me down and talk to me or 'humiliate' me and try to make me think 'right' and tell me to be 'normal' and laugh at my problems, which obviously made it even more worse than it already had been. I used to have friends but I didn't had the luck to finding a true kind, the kind that sticks with you and understands you and supports you. My bad that I stuck with some who only made my hopelessness even more hopeless. They laughed, joked, made fun and I just stood getting my last bits of self esteem and confidence getting crushed. Now, I am at a really, like really fucking confused state of mind. 8-9 years of my battle with anxiety and my own inner demons, I sometimes am confused thinking, 'Am I making it worse for myself?', 'I want friends but at the same time, I don't want them', 'I want to talk but then I don't want to talk either', 'Is what I'm suffering from my own imaginative creation?'. I have been raised in a family that believes that mental problems are not real and that it's all in the head. Having been surrounded with that sort of perception, I don't even really know if what I am suffering from is even legit. I can't deal with people judging me. I have been subject to harsh criticism, I have been told that I'm not beautiful, I'm not good enough, I'm not smart enough. I try not to think about it but then those things play repeatedly over and again in my head and it just drains me out even more. I try not to think and be like let people say or do what they want, I don't care but I do, I do care and it gets so fucking pathetic. I feel indignant. I want to die but then don't want to die either. I overanalyze. It's just that I am really confused individual or at least that's what I think. I don't even know anymore. Even now as I'm writing, I feel like  me mentioning the people that I did is like 'maybe they didn't do anything, it's you who thought like that, you're to be blamed (to myself)'. Though, I don't want anyone else to suffer this, I sometimes wish that some one else would have it just so they can really relate to what I'm going through. Please tell me if I'm being stupid or unreasonable. (ALSO, I'm fucking sensitive. I get hurt very easily and I feel like when I consider what I say to other people so as to not hurt their feelings, people just jabs a dagger right through with their meanest words.)",13Jan2018,1
17,"for god knows how long ive fallen into this really depressive state. my mom who was once my best friend, now drinks her days away with my step dad. my dad is hardly in my life and i push all of his attempts to be, away for the most part. ive distanced myself from all 2 of my friends, never hanging out with them and only seeing them at school. my boyfriend of 2.5 years is the light of my life. unfortunately we do long distance for the last 2 years (but only for 5 more months!), so when i see him (every other weekend), i spend as much time as possible with him. the distance is really hard for me because im so dependent on his company. i can function just fine without him but he makes me so god damn happy and i want to spend every waking minute with him. whenever he's away, i fall into these depressive states. sometimes something happens and that'll make me sad, other times I'll just think myself into this mood. I try telling my boyfriend about it, but recently it's started an argument because i ""won't listen to his help"" or that its just the same thing over and over again. Which it is, and that mentally and emotionally frustrates me as well. I listen to what he says when he's trying to help me, but some of it is just so hard to act on, and i dont think he always sees the situation in its entirety because every time he's here things are never as bad as when he's away?

21,"My worry is that my depression is returning although having experienced it for 5 years, I'm not sure whether my concerns are my personality or my illness. Sometimes the two become blurred.

In the past I've tried to nip a relapse in the bud but this time I can't be sure it is depression. I feel so worried about work. I sleep a lot- when I'm not at work I lock myself in my bedroom and sleep or such tv, I don't choose to socialise. 

Recently I've realised that I'm plodding along so to speak. There's nothing in the future which I'm 'looking forward to' and I seem to be living to work (which I hate at the moment). I feel like I'm existing rather than surviving. There is no element of fun in my life. Choosing what to eat for dinner is as exciting as it gets.

23,"I have decided to wean off Pristiq 50mg after taking it for 2.5 years.
I was prescribed it for depression which I have no seriously suffered from for a while now.
I previously went off this medication at age 18 cold turkey and went through a month of quite horrible withdrawal symptoms including dizziness, agitation, altered vision, ""brain zaps"" (I experienced this as a kind of clicking feeling when I moved my eyes around) and other unpleasantries. My depression came back but I don't know if this was due to this or other things going on in my life at the time.

This time myself and my doctor have gotten a compounding pharmacy to make my prescription into 10mg capsules to make the weaning easier. My doctor recommended I take 40mg then reduce the dose by 10mg every 3 weeks. The process should take 3 months to be completely off the drug.

I'm pretty worried about what's going to happen, and considering this is going to take 3 months I'm worried that it's going to be 3 months of the above withdrawal symptoms. I'm also pretty worried about my depression returning even though it's okay now.
I really don't want to have to keep taking them any more.

24,"Hi everyone. So I'm new to Reddit and to give a bit of context, I'm a Graphic Designer living with Autism, who has been struggling a lot lately.

I started a new role as a Junior Designer at an agency, (following an internship at a start-up company) and I'm terrified that I won't make it past my probationary period.

The issue isn't relating to creativity (i.e. being able to come up with new concepts and ideas), but more my ability to understand specifically what the client and my boss wants, without misunderstanding. I also have also have great difficulties with memory, which means that when it comes to feedback on my work, I usually miss something off, even when I write it down.

The main difficulties I experience with Autism are:

1. Difficulties with language and communication.
2. Problems with short-term memory.
3. Executive functioning, which includes self-monitoring, organising and planning and problems with switching back and forth between tasks.

On top of this, I also think I'm suffering with problems from Anxiety and Depression, (which I'll admit that I first started seeing the signs before I started work with the agency), which have progresively gotten worse to a point where I realise I can no longer cope on my own. Symptoms I'm currently experiencing include: loss of appetite, oversleeping, feelings of emptiness/, feeling like a failure, feelings of guilt and hopelessness, decreased energy etc.

As a result, I've booked a Doctor's appointment this week, in the hope that I will be able to seek help and am also thinking about raising the issue with my employer, but have no idea how.

The worst part is, (which sounds horrible), is that a lot of how I'm feeling at the moment goes back to my disability and worrying about how much I'm going to struggle later in life with regards to employment.

So, are there any Autistics/ anyone else who can relate and how did you go about raising the issue with your employer. Did you quit, discuss the issue with your boss or continue on, despite knowing the struggle? Thank you.",13Jan2018,2

I was assaulted about a year ago, was dissociated for months, had the worst year ever, saw 2 therapists but stopped going because it wasn't helping, and eventually over summer I tried to better myself through surrounding myself around family, exercising regularly and eating healthy.

It was all okay for a while but now I feel this weird sense of newfound anxiety and panic. Towards the end of last year I lost all my best friends from back home because I couldn't open up to them, and now I feel incredibly lonely. 

I went to Japan with my mother over winter break, but now that I'm back at uni I just can't seem to *remember* a lot about the trip. It's like I feel so disconnected from myself and everyone else, as though things and experiences just aren't registering properly in my brain anymore. It's freaking me out a bit. I just feel this strange weight on my chest, like somethings weighing me down. 

I cater my personality to fit the way I think the person I'm interacting with will like me the best, but now I just don't know who I am anymore. I feel miserable and I feel like crying all the time.

I don't want to seek help again because the last 2 times I did were really awful. I've been trying to join more clubs and practice meditation, but nothing seems to be working. If anyone has any words of advice or comments I would be greatly appreciated.",13Jan2018,1
28,"It's that time of the year again. As happened with the last 4 apartments I lived in over the past 3 years I'm being kicked out again. This time it's due to financial problems.
I'm working as a freelance graphic designer (working from home). A decision I made because severe social anxiety didn't allow me to continue working a 'normal' office job. 
Even though this was a very positive change, the fact that my mental health constantly swings from OK to apocalypse makes it a pain in the ass to maintain a stable income.

Right now I'm living in a tiny yet ridiculously expensive apartment just outside a big city, just like I always have. In my quest to finding a more affordable place to stay, I started looking into houses in the countryside. This is something I never even considered before. I grew up in a city and kinda just stuck around... 
But I found myself being mind blown by the cheap rent and massive amount of space that comes with living in the middle of nowhere. So I've gotten more and more into the idea of actually moving away from the city.

Here's the problem though;

Because of my poor mental health I have not yet succeeded in maintaining any friendships or acquaintances. This in combination with me working from home causes me to get very lonely. But even though I don't have friends or anyone to talk to myself, I get the feeling that living in a city and being permanently surrounded by other people comforts me in some way. 

I don't know if that's actually true. But I'm scared that if it is true, I will end up feeling very isolated and anxious when I'm not surrounded by a bunch of people 24/7.

Has anyone had a similar experience, or some form of advice on this matter? 

Eternally grateful in advance.",13Jan2018,1
29,"Hi everyone,

I went to the doctor because of the intense anxiety I have been feeling. I was diagnosed with depression over 10 years ago and I am in my 30s. I genuinely feel like the main reason for my anxiety is my job and the amount of work I have to do for it. I work from 7:30am until 6pm every weekday and work Sunday at home too. The work I am supposed to do is still not done at that point and I found myself utterly spent, unable to keep working and despairing.

The doctor signed me off work for nearly 3 weeks. This was very welcome. But, two days into it, I am feeling lost and dreading return.

My question is, how do I make the most of this time? What should I do?

Any advice or suggestions at all are very welcome. I'm open to anything.",13Jan2018,1

33,So I came here for awnsers not to be judged. So everybody who knows me thinks I’m a normal person that nothings wrong with me but I think something happened. So about last year I took a bunch of antidepressants cause I was bored and had nothing else to do and had to go to the hospital because of an overdose. Then later next month I took 3 tabs of lsd and I think it did something to my brain like my brain had enough. I feel like I’m still not the same for that trip also from when I od on antidepressants I didn’t feel the same either. My impulsive side is more powerful now like it is hard for me to hold them back like when I used to life with my family we had a dog and i would abuse it and do it just cause and feel nothing when I would do it. I have feelings but I can dull them when I do bad things. I used to go to a private school in my childhood but I had to leave when I threw a rock at a kid. My friends see me as normal but I’m acting when I’m around them normally my friends think I have a lazy attitude and that everything is boring for me. Does anyone know what this is I’m intrigued to know? And yes I have feelings but when I do this stuff I don’t feel them.,13Jan2018,1

I've got three exams coming up that I haven't studied for because I've been too depressed/anxious, how can I get out of this bad mindset?

35,"I am a female (24) and I am quiet, reserved and usually very calm. In fact most people always get a first impression of me as an innocent ""church girl"". I am modest and just keep to myself. I seem normal but not these incidences. I drank one night and got very drunk. This happened in public and I was starting to black out so the police were called. The paramedics came first and tried to wheel me away but I hate hospitals so I fought them HARD. I was ripping off the belts trying to unbuckle myself, kicking my way off the stretcher. I began to kick the inside of the ambulance screaming "" I am NOT going to your stupid hospital, LET ME GO!!!"". The paramedics kept strapping me back in but I just kept screaming and crying. When I realized that we arrived at the hospital, all hell broke loose in me. I began violently screaming and yelling that I am not going to go in. As they wheeled me in forcibly, I started screaming "" I DONT WANT TO LIVE, let me go I want to die, let me go!!"" ...About 10 nurses began to hold me down and I got worse. I started yelling that everyone likes to hurt me and that they were hurting me and they had to let me go. I mean I was yelling at the top of my lungs and really fighting to break loose. I was asking them why they weren't killing me and that they had to because they were hurting me. I was then sedated and knocked out. I woke up to being restrained, horrible 2 days. This is way out of my character. Imagine the nicest, sweetest girl you know behaving like this.
This isn't the first time I had an insane outburst. One time, I was at my boyfriends place where he invited his friends over. My boyfriend and his friends are ALOT older, like old enough to be my parents but that isn't the point. I guess they didn't like the fact I was dating him so they were always a bit mean to me. Anyway, one time I was making food and one of his friends came in and shoved me out his way so he can get to the fridge. I lost it. I shoved him right back and yelled "" DONT TOUCH ME!!"" I began kicking him and hitting him and scratching the hell out of him. He tried to calm me down but I couldn't stop. I began to smash all the dishes onto the floor breaking and throwing everything in sight while screaming "" Don't touch me, don't push me, don't hit me!! You wont do it, you cant, DONT you dare come near me!!"" The thing is he was far away from me but I just kept yelling all of this and being destructive. At this point my boyfriend and his other friends ran in but I yelled for all of them to stay away from me. I grabbed all the chairs in the dinning area and every heavy furniture I could gather and surrounded it around me while holding a broken lamp in my hand. I told them that if anyone dared come near me I would smash their face in. I continued to just scream saying nothing while kicking the furniture around me and breaking the lamp into so many pieces. I then ran out of breath and just layed on the floor crying until I calmed down. I was SO EMBARRASED after I calmed down. Its like I became myself again. I just ran out of there and didn't speak to him for a month because I couldn't explain myself, I was super ashamed. I hated myself for that, I hate when these things happen but I have no idea why. I do not want to go to therapy, I just want insights and opinions on why I am like this or why I behave like this. When these moments happen, there is NO WAY of stopping myself, I don't even know what happens, I become a whole new person.

39,"I've been avoiding asking out girls for a long time because of social anxiety and my therapist explained to me that that behaviour has lead to depression because of the loneliness I feel. 

The thing is, a lot of girls think I'm cute and what not and some of them even try to put themselves in a situation where I would ask them out. I'm so socially anxious that I would literally try to escape them or get out of those situations because I would rather run away then actually talk to them. Then I always feel terrible about it because not only am I making myself feel lonely and depressed, I'm also making the girls feel bad because they think they're not good enough or that they're ugly, so I feel like an asshole. Some of them even call me an asshole afterwards (which really doesn't help obviously).

43,"Hey, I'm a recently-turned eighteen-year old, male, sorry this is a long post but I am in desperate need of help. About four months ago I took just over a gram of MDMA within the course of five weeks (prior to this I had only taken MDMA four or five times, each only having 120mg-240mg per session). Ever since then I have been dealing with a mass slew of psychological issues and mental disorders (which prior to taking MDMA I have had zero history of - my life was perfect aside from some confidence issues) which over time have slowly trickled away but currently I'm dealing with anxiety. Now this wouldn't be so bad but recently I learned how the mind can associate random things with this anxious feeling and I think it's sort of happened to me but with the act of thinking:

If I'm listening to good music or I'm not focusing on anything specific I'll start to daydream about myself doing something, like a little story, usually something in line with the tone of the music I'm listening to, so if it's action-packed music I'll imagine myself in a fight, stuff like that. However, as of late I've started having intrusive thoughts that have caused me to associate any time I imagine myself in the third person in one of these stories I daydream with the anxiety, although I think it's less that a subconscious association has been made, but rather that I've thought to myself ""wouldn't it be bad if I associated these things I think about with anxiety"" and because of this, every time I try to imagine one of these stories, I'm reminded of the anxiety, resulting in me getting head tension/pressure every time I try to imagine these things, stopping me from being able to concentrate and preventing me from daydreaming. It feels as if my mind is fighting against me or as if I'm fighting against myself for control over what I think about as I can't naturally think of these stories anymore, I have to force them, resulting in this uncomfortable head tension/pressure. This ""association"" sometimes spills into other thoughts as well, it's almost like a disease that's slowly corrupting my mind.

How can I stop this?? I don't know how to control my mind and it's so quickly ruining my life. I don't want to kill myself but I CANNOT live like this!!",13Jan2018,1

46,"This post will come across as a bit emotionless but I don't think I'm a psychopath, just trying to be honest about how I feel despite the gravity of my actions. Just looking for some advice if anyone has experienced this or knows what this urge could be classified as. 

For as long as I can remember I have been obsessed with the idea of running away from everybody and everything and starting a new life in a different city or country. This obsession has always stemmed from things I've done that I find embarrassing, or don't want to be associated with anymore. For instance, my teenage years were, to put it simply, awful. I hated my secondary school and didn't have many friends. I was miserable and retreated into video games and the internet to forget about all of that, and so went through school a pretty big nerd, depressed, anxious, with few social skills and even fewer friends. When I finished school, instantly I didn't want to be associated with anything from that point in my life. I unfriended everyone I knew from that stage in my life, deleted numbers, posts on my Facebook wall, photos, any trace of what I had been like. It was such an amazing rush doing all of that, which you may think is understandable because I had a bad time there, but that feeling extended to cutting off really close friends from school who I'd played video games with online every day for the last few years. I didn't care that I'd cut them out - I was so happy to remove all of that from my life that those friendships made nothing to me, I didn't even hesitate. 

I went through college (UK, so ages 16-18) a ghost. My depression was the worst it ever got at this point and I had no energy to be social. I went to classes, sat in silence, then went home. The few people I spoke to during my time there got the same treatment once I left. That included the one person from my school who joined the same college as me, and was my best friend while I was there. 

Now I'm in my third year of University and have mostly had an amazing time. I never expected to love University but it has really helped me get social and feel normal for the first time. I go out a lot, have a great friendship group, and am getting better and better at talking to strangers etc. I struggle with things still like everyone does but mostly it's great. I feel like a normal uni student. But despite this, this urge I have always had isn't going away. I'll have graduated and moved back home in half a year and know if I don't get this urge under control I will cut ties with all of them the second I go home. And knowing how hard it is to make friends outside of things like school and university, and how these people are the closest, best friends I've ever had, I realize that this is a stupid thing to want to do that I will never really be able to recover from. But I can realize that and still want to do that. It can be the most minor thing, like how I got really drunk one night and there's a video of me talking nonsense, that sets off this feeling of wanting to cut ties with everyone who knows me. If anything, I want to go further and move country once I graduate. 

My parents are great and support me and love me. I love them too, but if it wouldn't hurt them I would cut ties with them in a second as well (in the same way not wanting to hurt your parents is a common reason to not commit suicide). And I don't even think I'd feel bad about it...in a way for this type of urge parents are the worst offenders. They've been seeing me embarrass myself since I was in nursery, know all my secrets and struggles. And I hate that they know all that. 

Some extra context....when I originally cut ties from friends from my school, they ended up getting back in contact with me. And now out of sheer coincidence, two of them live in the same city as me. I hang out with them every couple weeks and still can't wait to get them back out of my life! I have a good time when I'm with them, but in a way see this current situation as a necessary evil that can be fixed once I graduate. They represent the worst portion of my life and know all sorts of embarrassing things about me. 

TL;DR: Thinking my life will never be great enough that I won't want to cut all ties with my past.

47,"  When I'm at school, I sometimes have a hard time paying attention in class, because even though I'll be looking at the teacher the entire time, I won't pick up majority or half of what they say even though I'm really trying me best to listen. If not that, I would be on the verge of crying for no reason and start choking my breath. This could be due to bad thoughts that distracts me a lot, but other times I legit don't know why. Then when I come home, as I do my homework, my mind keep having negative thoughts (negative thoughts that really aren't that bad tbh) leading to be on the verge of crying multiple times while I do my work or choke on my breath. And it's really distracting to the point I'm afraid to do work.

   This is on and off, especially getting distracted easily and crying for irrational reason, those has happened since I think 6th or 7th grade. The choking started this year. 

    I felt like I was about to cry 3 or 5 times once, while I was doing classwork. As I was taking an exam, my throat tightened and I start having shorter breaths. The day before school start after winter break, I cried, because when I go back Im gonna feel lonely and anxious all over again and these symptoms are gonna come back. 

    At one point in bed, I snapped, something triggered me as I was on my phone. I start tearing up I honestly don't know why. I got up and frantically try to look for a blade so I can cut myself. I found scissors but luckily was too scare to do it.

I seek my school counselors so many times for help. They promise me to put me in an anxiety help group they never did and this is after going to them multiple time for help. Each time, they try to send me back to class. I had an anxiety attack one morning, she keep trying to send me back to class. I didn't receive help at the end. I do notice that when there's a break, these symptoms died down or disappeared though.

I just wanna receive help, is seeing a doctor a rational option? My mom thinks my experiences are bullshit and I made them up, that I just need to get off my phone for a bit and it'll all be better,but this happens even when I'm not on my phone, like playing piano.

49,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Apologies if this is not the right subreddit for this kind of thing, please point me in the right direction as I wasn't sure where to post.

I'm a 47 year old single father of two, both my daughters (17 and 23) live with me. Yesterday I got a brief but very strange phone call from my ex-wife (divorced almost 10 years) whom I rarely talk to (maybe 1-2 times a year and only in matters pertaining to the kids). She ""just wanted to find out if I am okay"" (totally unusual but I shrugged it off). Today, my ex-wife, wakes me up by blowing up all our phones. When I answer she is wailing and sobbing and screaming and demands to know if our kids are alive and well. I awaken them (they were sleeping) to find out, and of course they are okay, but she has since hung up. Then she calls back a little later and says she is 10 minutes away and will be at my house shortly to talk with all of us (she lives 30 miles away).

When she arrives she is sobbing and asks me ""how much I know"". She begins telling me that she has been hearing voices in her head for at least 6 weeks. She says these voices are ""clear as a bell"", that she has heard them outside the home but they seem strongly amplified at her home (she lives with her long time boyfriend), especially coming from the vents. She says the voices tell her ""terrible"" things about herself and about me and our older daughter. She told me that the voices told her that our younger daughter was dead. She said she believe she is surrounded by witches and that she believe that her two neighbors in her townhome complex are somehow ""in on it"". She demanded of my daughter to know whether or not she had ""cast a spell"" on her. She was surprised that I wasn't already aware of any of the things she described. The whole time she is sobbing and clearly upset. 

I assured her no one had cast any spell on her and I asked her whether she had been taking any drugs lately. She said that she had, although she refused to say what kind. She stated she last used 2 weeks ago. She (apparently earlier) confessed to my older daughter that she has used heroin last month at some point. I know for a fact she has done cocaine in the past, and signs suggest that her current boyfriend and her are apparently into other drugs as well (not sure what kind though... my daughter had discovered a glass pipe - not a weed pipe - once upon a time at her house). She is also known to be the victim of recurring physical abuse from her current boyfriend. She herself has a history of unstable and violent behavior in the past, part of the reason why I divorced her in the first place. 

My gut tells me that her instability, combined with abuse and drug use has led to some kind of psychotic break, either that or she was acutely intoxicated today when she came over. According to my daughter, the ex-wife said later that she had been awake all night and ""hadn't slept in days"".

Obviously her behavior deeply disturbed all of us, especially our daughters, and they were able to persuade her to get into the car so that they could seek help. At the ER, the ex-wife relayed the stories about the voices to the physicians and counselors. They took her blood pressure and said that it was extremely high. She explained that she was just upset, but the person taking the reading said that they have only ever seen such a reading due to drug use. Ultimately though, she refused any treatment, refused to pee in a cup or have blood drawn or anything else. She ultimately demanded to be discharged, and not having a clear reason to believe she was a harm to herself or others, she was released.

Personally, I'd be fine never dealing with her again, but she is always going to be the mother of our children, and that is who I truly am concerned about. My older daughter has seen enough past nonsense with her mom that she feels like cutting ties and finding ways to cope herself, but my younger daughter is very sad about it and wants to help her mom. At the same time, I don't feel it is healthy that my daughters (especially the younger one, who is dealing with her own, unrelated issues) to have to put up with this erratic behavior from their mom.

What can my daughter do, if anything, to help her mom that won't be too emotionally taxing for her own self? We've seen that driving her to the ER doesn't help. I've suggested she could try to make phone calls and set up appointments with counselors, etc., but ultimately her mom is going to have to be the one to actually go to the appointment and I don't feel like my daughter should pay the emotional price of dealing with it.

What can I do, to prevent another such occurrence? Honestly who knows, one day she could hear voices telling her to do things, maybe bad things... it does make me concerned about security. I can't just have her dropping by on a moments notice to have a meltdown. It is upsetting (and possibly dangerous) to the kids as well as myself.

What could be the cause of the ex-wife's behavior? I'm no doctor, but my guess is mental illness combined with drug use (maybe some kind of amphetamine?)  and physical abuse has just driven her over the edge. I'm mainly just concerned about protecting the physical and mental well being of my daughters and my self, and of course my daughters are concerned about their mom's mental health.

What are we in for? Hopefully she can get help but I feel it is likely that she will not, and that I will have to expect random things like this affecting us in the future. 
What can/should we do?
