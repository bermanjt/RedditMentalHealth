0,"We all know the theme of creative types suffering from mental illness (how many artists died of overdose/suicide this year???). Personally my creativity is something I'm most proud of, yet I've always felt like an outcast and struggle with mental health issues that are not quite defined yet. I am working on an electronic album and have a fairly well fleshed out fantasy novel outline, but for the life of me I can't get motivated to actually finish what I start. I remember trying my hand at songwriting and creative writing as early as middle school. It's like the very traits that make me constantly imagining stories and tunes in my head also prevent me from being productive. I'm in therapy, on prescription drugs, abuse alcohol, and frequently alienate myself from people. What gives?? I bet there are a lot of you folks who can relate- go ahead and vent. I mostly post here out of narcissistic intent: the introvert is always thinking about me myself and I.",28Oct2018,1

2,"I have anxiety and am taking antidepressants, which were working for a good few months but ever since starting second year I have felt so alone and afraid and I need a way out. I sit in lectures feeling like everyone hates me whilst me circle of friends is shrinking and shrinking. I feel so pathetic and unworthy of any attention. I want to cut myself from the moment I wake up until I try to get to sleep, but I have held off because i made a promise to my boyfriend. It’s affecting my uni attendance because I’m too scared to see people as I feel like they will judge me and laugh at me. I wish I could erase myself from all existence. I really don’t know what to do. I can’t kill myself but I feel like it’s the only way out of this, for me and everyone who is still around me. I think everyone else has moved on with their lives and just see me as a spare part. Help me please",28Oct2018,1
3,"Before anyone says go to a therapist. I have, Multiple times and multiple therapists. Everyone keeps giving me different responses. The most recent threw out the suggestion of bipolar 2, before I just stopped going (after I started being more honest with her). I will not take anything here as an absolute diagnosis, only as your opinions of what it could maybe be.

My issues are:

Intrusive thoughts (especially in a relationship).
Paranoia.
I have moments where I will feel very agitated and aggressive, like I'm jittering on the inside and need to go do something.
I go though depressive episodes that last up to a week, which involves me not leaving the house, not eating much, isolating myself, not talking to anyone, a mix of feeling numb and tearful, and feeling very mentally and physically slow. These happen multiple times a month.
Other times I feel ""active"" and impulsive, having sex with a few different people over a course of a couple weeks, or things like posting naked photos online, naked photos to a boss (who asked), etc. However, sometimes this is also a response to my depressive episodes.
Highly reactive, especially in romantic relationships.
I cant stand boredom. 
Love/relationship dependency (I cant stay single)
Issues connecting with/loving others.
Get random moods of neding to go on adventurous 
Anxiety.
Sometimes I just dont ""feel"" like sleeping, so I'll stay up until I only get like 2 hours of sleep before school/work.
Sometimes I'll start drinking/smoking pot more but generally my impulsivness/recklessness is of a sexual nature.
Trouble recognizing boundaries 
I feel like I feel everything minor, intensely.
I get lost in my own head a lot of times, like I'll be walking and I'll have a scene in my head I'm playing out, and be talking OUT loud along to it.
I get ""crazy"" when I am attached to people romantically. I'll be reading my test messages and be speaking out loud without knowledge of it (others bug me for it)
I also have obsessive tendencies

I am not suicidal, I do not self harm physically, and I do not generally abuse substances. Im 24F. I do have former trauma and family issues. I have no problem functioning in school or work. It is mostly my interpersonal relationships...

5,"I hate mental illness sometimes. I had a mini-breakdown (the reason isn't important or even noteworthy) and cried for a half hour straight. All the frustration and anger that has been building up came out. I feel strangely calm now AND I got something to eat. Our 11 year old made me some rice with butter and salt and it was the most delicious thing I've had in 2 days. Not only do I have my strength back but I can also concentrate better and my mood has improved a lot.  


As for the disorder itself, it is still there, kicking and clawing at its cage...but it hasn't escaped. I don't feel like talking about that part of me right now, so just know that I am doing better and feeling a little more like myself now.

(I know you will probably tell me to go to a therapist but i do not want that to conflict with my work. I am in the army so i dont want to lose my job)

My mind is a tricky person. He talks to me but not in words. Rather, in emotions. I wish there was a better way to describe this. Please dont think of me as a crazy person. I would come across as a relatively normal person if you were to meet me in real life. But i feel like multiple people make up my life. One is a cynical asshole. One is a generous, yet awkward individual and the other is a quiet, serious ""down to business"" type individual. I rarely stray from these personalities. 

I notice my values change with each person and even my apearance changes in the mirror just slightly. 

 I am having trouble figuring out who I am. I dont hang out with friends or family because i do not have either in my life. I only have work. I feel like my life is passing by. I will wake up one day and realize my life has amounted to nothing.  Ive never had a relationship and i dont think anyone could deal with being in a relationship with me. If you dont think that is true then just look at my comment history. Its a fucking mess of emotion. I consider myself an artist. I have been drawing crazy shit for years. It is the only thing I am truely proud of.

9,"About 6 years ago, I started to hear voices. The only way I can explain it was that it was like hundreds of people screaming at me to do different things or trying to get my attention. Nothing dark, no requests to hurt myself or others.
At the time, I was still struggling with loss from when I was about 12. Had never talked to anyone about it, ever. I told my best friend about it and he sat me down, said nothing, but let me just talk. Hours on end. He would never pass out, criticise me, judge, anything.
After about a month of doing this, I was better. As in no voices, no (excessive) pain from the loss, etc.  (I was still sad about the loss, but I felt I had dealt with it)

Flash forward to about 3 days ago. I was sitting in my living room when the voices began to come back. I don't understand why this time. It seemed like last time it ever happened I had a reason for it to be happening.
Not only were there voices, again no violent messages, but this time my heart rate went up and I began to panic.
I immediately put on some soothing EDM. Within minutes it was gone as I focused on the music.
I'm concerned as I don't know what I could be that is triggering it.
I don't think I'm crazy. I know there are some mental health issues in my family - mothers side - but that could have started mostly from substance abuse.

I feel vulnerable by posting this on the internet but I would hope for some sort of suggestion or guidance. Even if it's from strangers. ",28Oct2018,1

11,"I apologise if this doesn’t make any sense, it’s currently 2am and I have a pounding headache from crying most of the night. 

So today emotions and events that happened years ago all cams flooding back to me today and I don’t know how to feel. 

I recently saw a therapist at my school for 10 minutes who Im considering visiting again because he said words that truly hit me. That I have been through a lot of shit and I haven’t even realised it because I don’t think it’s that bad. 

To back it up, I’ve just started antidepressants for anxiety. My dad was on antidepressants a few years back for depression and was suicidal. I was VERY aware he was suicidal as he often told me how he was going to commit suicide and I honestly have no clue if he did this to anyone else. 

At the same time, I was dealing with coming to terms with my sexuality (I’m very confident with it now luckily and have been to several prides). My dad of course was a raging homophobe talking about how gay people all deserve to be shot. So you can imagine how that felt and never came out to him and still haven’t. 

I then dealt with a toxic relationship with a girl who lied saying I made her feel suicidal and suffocated in the relationship and then when I confronted her about it she said it was because she loved me and wanted to stop loving me so lied about me so she could do that. Fucking fantastic. 

THEN, my friends all stopped being my friends saying that I spent too much time with said girlfriend (I actually only ever saw her at school) and then I had no friends. Yay. 


Fast forward 3 years and I had a new best friend (he’s great and we’re still friends) but that’s about it. I have no other friends and I’m currently at university but travelling from home. 


Then tonight my dad was being a dick to my mum, so I called him a dick. I understood that I swore at him but he was drunk and Im very defensive over my mum as it’s a wonder she never divorced him. Then he starts to shout at me about how he raised me and how I should “Fuck off back to ______” the blank space being where my university is. 
And then every fucking emotion of the past few years came flooding back and I’m laid here wondering if I really am an awful person to all these people or is there something just about me that makes it easy to abuse?

Have I been mentally and emotionally abused in the past and I haven’t realised it because it wasn’t serious? 
I really don’t know what is up. 

Right now all I can think about is just taking my dads advice and leaving. But of course I have no where to go. 

Maybe I’m just overly emotional lol. ",28Oct2018,1
12,"ok so I struggle with a very interesting but definitely not unique problem. I have trouble telling what thoughts are mine and what I’ve sub consciously stolen. It drives me crazy sometimes. Within the past year I’ve gone from wanting to spend time with my friends to staying home and watching tv. I have this thought process where I over think everything and it usually means my answer to everything is no if it’s a big decision. 


I’ve found that I don’t want to be in a relationship and I don’t really feel attracted to anyone around me. I really want to love someone and be loved but I don’t think commitment is my thing. When I’m with my friends I have to act a certain way or they won’t really laugh or pay attention to me. Ive considered taking drugs or coping in other unhealthy ways but I think about the consequences too much. Sometimes I can’t tell if I’m acting crazy because I’m bored and I’m just subconsciously entertaining myself or if I’m actually losing it. I enjoy self destructive behavior (I mean socially and safety wise not self harm). And when I get stressed even if it’s a little thing I feel so much physical pain. I often cross boundaries and make people uncomfortable without realizing it. Sometimes I think I see things or feel things that others don’t but it doesn’t happen more than once a day. I don’t usually feel sad or anything and I don’t want to trivialize mental illness because it is a serious problem.

14,"TLDR : I’m 32 Australian with no real work history and feel like a fuck up . Believe I have symptoms of adhd poor memory , can’t follow instructions, forgetful , doing processes in wrong order etc

I’m skeptical in posting here ..

Hey

I have been dx with depression, anxiety , alcoholism and bipolar. Got two degrees from a top uni but had to work super hard, my then gf got me over the line by doing my work for me .
2 I was diagnosed by a dodgy doctor with having adhd , which set off a manic episode caused by dex and or modafinil .

3 New doctor stopped adhd meds thought I didn’t have adhd , went in and out of hospital for 3 years. Until stabilised with lithium. I still have depression.

4 Since then had terrible work history, doing even menial jobs , my supervisor when I was in construction basically treated me nicely but differently because he ‘thought there was something wrong with me’ and I felt I couldn’t follow instructions. Would fuck things up a lot .

5 Professional jobs I pretty much can’t concentrate , got fired after 3 weeks in a law firm .

6 I believe that I have adhd still, (or it’s depression) I struggle to read things properly and my hobby is to skim read things on the internet. In the outdoors , when hiking mountaineering skiing I’m off with the fairies and despite telling myself will do things in the wrong order. I’m super lazy and it feels like lots of thoughts are flying through my brain. I have a terrible working memory and forgetfulness with placing things ...

7 I am 32 and pretty much been fired or quit my jobs . I feel pathetic but I’m living off my parents .

15,"After I left high school, it just so happened I chose to live my life reclusively, choosing hobbies over friends. Being mentally ill meant I had an excuse to not work anywhere, so I just sat at home, played music, played video games, surfed the web. I basically had no contact with people. I'm 25 now and I just now realize how I was wrong. I myself made my life a living hell. Not talking to people, not having friends is the worst punishment there can be. So I started making friends again this summer. I have got to tell it's such a huge relief. To have ones to turn for advice. For support. Even just talking about some random stuff is such a blessing.

I work at a grocery store and everyone once in a while, if I'm doing some small tedious task, I have to fight the urge to just stop what I'm doing because I just don't care. That seems minute but when it's everything all day it's really tough to stay motivated to do anything.

Like you could go out to meet new people but they would talk to you like you're there to kill them. I hate how we can't have a serious conversation one minute and joke the other. I wanna talk to people that make me feel good about me. I wanna go to a party where lets say there are 25 people and I should be able to fw any of them. I wanna have conversations where I listen but now it's just that if I don't flex on them with my bank account the conversation is not spicy for them. I got a fresh ass outfit I'd love to talk about but all they care about is ""how much did it cost? who do you know?"" Know what I'm saying. People are not fond of conversing no more. People are sorting other people by what they do. You could have the most amazing conversation with the cleaning lady but you don't do that. I love seeing people do what they love even if they're not good at it. If you love something, go do it. Don't get me wrong you'll have fun but look from the standpoint of other people. I would love to see people do things that they love. I was thinking to myself how I wanna make more money and more than that. Don't worry about that I will but I can't see myself fulfilling what I have win me deep down because the only thing I love more than making money is delivering the people a higher level of product. I wanna see a world where I see this dude wearing the rarest pair of Jordans because he loves them and they stayed on the shelf because only the people that genuinely wanted it bought it but now the people that wanna make money off stuff they didn't create sell those on stockx and it pains me to see that the little black kid whose being raised by his mother alone saved $200 to get those yeezys but misses out on them because some dude got hands on the and sold the shoes on stockx to the international asian student for whom the shoes don't mean anything. I don't wanna make generalizations so I apologize for this bit and that's it I don't apologize for anything else. Long story short niggas, do whatever you really want to fuck looking cool if you like fucking dudes and not bitches you do you you could be happy one second sad the other see that person you wanna ask out? do that man. Try to make this world a better place and by default make money off it. Don't sell yourself out to no one.

I\[26F\] have a sister\[28\] who is currently undergoing treatments for depression. She was diagnosed a few years back and basically relapsed a couple months ago. She hates her job and frequently skips work and has been put through disciplinary action, leading to her current treatment.

I live with her, miles away from our parents, and she doesn't have a lot of friends, so I'm the one she primarily talks to. She is also in a long distance relationship with a no-good boyfriend. Recently, she has been whining A LOT about her life, but she shots down every single suggestion I give about how to cope and make things better. I myself have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 8 years ago and have since learned how to deal with it, but apparently what works for me doesn't work for her.

I feel very, very frustrated. Every day she whines, she sleeps very late and wakes up late, and spends a lot of her time on her phone on social media, despite me and our parents repeatedly asking her otherwise. She complains a lot about how her life sucks, but she doesn't do anything to try and help herself.

Another thing is how needy she is lately. She does these very annoying things to get your attention the way a child does, and for god's sake she is 28. Just an hour ago she texted me (she was sitting just in front of me btw): ""you're all very busy. Nobody really cared for me.""

That text drove me nuts. Maybe because I feel guilty, but also because I thought seeking for attention like that is pathetic. I snapped at her and compared her to an attention whore common friend, and told her that she's pathetic.

That is not how I should have handled things. I feel like the longer this drags on the worse our relationship will be. I miss having a big sister. We were very close growing up but this sickness is driving a wedge between us and to be honest I don't know how to deal with it. I'm a terrible sister, and I don't want to be.

27,"I feel like I am drowning a little here...
I have had OCD since I was 7 years old. It went through different obsessions and patterns of obsessions, such a handwashing, making sure I had always said please and thank you to the point where I would have a meltdown thinking I didn't say thank you well enough to the cashier at the supermarket to worrying that my family members would die. 

Then when I was 18, I finished my year twelve exams, my mother was diagnosed with cancer, my beloved pet died of cancer, I graduated high school, got my licence and got into university where I moved 2 hours away from my family and friends to live with 8 strangers. All in the space of three months. Needless to say I was very stressed and my OCD became 10x worse. I couldn't drive without having to pull over 8 times to complete rituals and was constantly afraid that I was going to hit someone and ruin their life. 

At the start of last year I was put a low dose of an SSRI drug. At the time a lot of my rituals revolved around an obession that I might hit a cyclist and then I would ruin their life and their families and I could never forgive myself.  My therapist at the time said ""just don't do the rituals"". So I challenged myself and one day coming home from the gym I didn't do my ritual when I saw a cyclist. Nothing happened! It was such an anxious but exciting moment. Until... I slowed down for the roundabout near my house and a boy of about ten cut across me on his bike. I slammed my foot on the brakes just in time but I will never forget the look of horror on his face as he stared at me. And from there things spiralled...

The internal aftermath of this event was traumatic and it marked the first time I self-harmed. I was put up to a higher dose of the SSRI which I did not tolerate well at all. I was so incredibly depressed and things spiralled even further. I kept self-harming religiously, I would have severe panic attacks where I would completely dissociated for hours at a time and seriously considered ending my life to the point where I did begin to attempt it but luckily did not complete the attempt due to one of my housemates stepping in. Eventually my doctor took me off the higher dose and things settled for a while.

Fast forward to halfway through this year. Through working with a new therapist, I managed to reduce the number of compulsion I had significantly. Then uni became more and more stressful and I was struggling to cope. So I went back to my doctor and, for reasons still unknown to me, I was put back up to the higher dosage of the same SSRI. Lo and behold it went just as terrible as last time and things quickly spiralled out of control. I started self-harming again and I tried to take an overdose. Eventually enough was enough and I begged her to change my medication. She then tried me with a drug from  the SNRI class and gave me a referral to a psychiatrist. This drug has worked fantastically for my depression and anxiety! I finally felt happy and I could even drive properly without overwhelming anxiety.

But whilst waiting for my appointment with the psychiatrist, I started to notice that my driving rituals were coming back with a vengeance. I mentioned this to the psychiatrist who explained that even though the drug I am on is really helpful for depression and anxiety, it does nothing to inhibit obessive behaviours and thoughts. I can barely drive. I just want to close my eyes so I don't see the colours of the cars and then have to keep track of how many I have to tap my fingers so that I don't imagine hitting them but obviously I can't do this. Even when someone else is driving if I close my eyes I still see blue cars and green cars and yellow and red and the number of times I have to tap. I just want to stop obsessing. I just want it all to stop. I can't go back and see my therapist as she has moved and I haven't found anyone new yet.

What do I do???

28,"I'm not posting this in order to be diagnosed. I do plan on seeing a doctor---I already have, actually, and I go back for a follow up soon. 

I just need some advice. 

The thing is, it feels like my mental health and cognitive function have slowly declined over the last few years. It started my senior year of high school and keeps getting worse. I used to be an avid reader. I have been for as long as I can remember. Nowadays, it's hard for me to read even one paragraph. I often have to reread the same thing 2 or 3 times. I also loved to write and I think I was somewhat good at it but now I'm awful and the passion to write isn't there anymore anyway. I'm not really interested in anything. 

As you can imagine this has made college extremely difficult for me. I can't focus long enough to study and I don't have the motivation to do it either. I feel like it's harder for me to absorb information. I'm bad at thinking. All around, I feel like I'm getting dumber. 

My doctor DOES seem to think I have depression...she gave me a prescription for it but I quit taking those after a few days because it gave me anxiety and made my kidneys hurt. I don't plan on trying any other meds because I don't feel like wasting money on different kinds until I find the right one. 

But I wonder if it's something else that could be causing my issues? I do have tinnitus which definitely hasn't helped, but my mental decline started before I got that. 

I was also very recently diagnosed with low frequency hearing loss. I wonder if that could have damaged my cognitive function without me realizing it? I've read online that it can, if left untreated. 

In any case, I just don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe I don't actually have depression and my issues are all a symptom of something else.

Then when I was 18, I finished my year twelve exams, my mother was diagnosed with cancer, my beloved pet died of cancer, I graduated high school, got my licence and got into university where I moved 2 hours away from my family and friends to live with 8 strangers. All in the space of three months. Needless to say I was very stressed and my OCD became 10x worse. I couldn't drive without having to pull over 8 times to complete rituals and was constantly afraid that I was going to hit someone and ruin their life. 

At the start of last year I was put a low dose of an SSRI drug. At the time a lot of my rituals revolved around an obession that I might hit a cyclist and then I would ruin their life and their families and I could never forgive myself.  My therapist at the time said ""just don't do the rituals"". So I challenged myself and one day coming home from the gym I didn't do my ritual when I saw a cyclist. Nothing happened! It was such an anxious but exciting moment. Until... I slowed down for the roundabout near my house and a boy of about ten cut across me on his bike. I slammed my foot on the brakes just in time but I will never forget the look of horror on his face as he stared at me. And from there things spiralled...

The internal aftermath of this event was traumatic and it marked the first time I self-harmed. I was put up to a higher dose of the SSRI which I did not tolerate well at all. I was so incredibly depressed and things spiralled even further. I kept self-harming religiously, I would have severe panic attacks where I would completely dissociated for hours at a time and seriously considered ending my life to the point where I did begin to attempt it but luckily did not complete the attempt due to one of my housemates stepping in. Eventually my doctor took me off the higher dose and things settled for a while.

Fast forward to halfway through this year. Through working with a new therapist, I managed to reduce the number of compulsion I had significantly. Then uni became more and more stressful and I was struggling to cope. So I went back to my doctor and, for reasons still unknown to me, I was put back up to the higher dosage of the same SSRI. Lo and behold it went just as terrible as last time and things quickly spiralled out of control. I started self-harming again and I tried to take an overdose. Eventually enough was enough and I begged her to change my medication. She then tried me with a drug from  the SNRI class and gave me a referral to a psychiatrist. This drug has worked fantastically for my depression and anxiety! I finally felt happy and I could even drive properly without overwhelming anxiety.

But whilst waiting for my appointment with the psychiatrist, I started to notice that my driving rituals were coming back with a vengeance. I mentioned this to the psychiatrist who explained that even though the drug I am on is really helpful for depression and anxiety, it does nothing to inhibit obessive behaviours and thoughts. I can barely drive. I just want to close my eyes so I don't see the colours of the cars and then have to keep track of how many I have to tap my fingers so that I don't imagine hitting them but obviously I can't do this. Even when someone else is driving if I close my eyes I still see blue cars and green cars and yellow and red and the number of times I have to tap. I just want to stop obsessing. I just want it all to stop. I can't go back and see my therapist as she has moved and I haven't found anyone new yet.

What do I do???

30,"I realized just now, buzzed from drinking, that I only experience deep feeling while under the influence. I only experience enamour when high on opiates. I only experience joy after using cannabis. I only experience introspect when drinking. The only occasional emotions I experience whilst sober are sorrow and anger. The first time I remember feeling anything, which is my first actual deeply carved memory, is seeing my dad's mouth fill with blood as he lost consciousness- the moment he stopped telling me that he was okay after falling from so far. I felt loss in that moment. I ran for help as my older brothers left me in their trail of dust to do the same. I remember feeling lost as they left my sight and I had no idea where I was. I remember the confusion I felt after hearing he was alive after watching him die, after hearing the impact.

In the following 13 years, I have felt only brief moments of shallow existence. I feel warm when my girlfriend smiles at me. I feel upset when I see a lost dog post. I feel anxiety when in the presence of my company executives. I feel all of those things for, usually, less than a minute before returning to my state of living-dead. Days, sometimes weeks pass between feelings. Even longer between each ""good"" feeling. 

What scares me is that I only experience comfort and  hopefulness when I remember that I will one day die. I feel good when I think of the crazy driver in town veering into my car. I long for the chance to rush to save someone from a burning building. The idea of being help up at gunpoint brings me to almost laugh...

I have no plan of seeking help, only the occasional venting. Thanks for being that vent.",28Oct2018,1
31,"Well, this may be a long story. Recently I was told by a roommate that she just can't stand my temper, my words sometimes hurt her and we had almost broke up. I tried to fix up and confessed myself to her and we finally made peace. This got me thinking that am I really an annoying one？
In middle school, I was told by someone that I had a weird temper, I dunno maybe I looked friendly last second, and then I became somehow angry and aggressive easily.
In high school, during the last year, I had a really bad time. I remember I messed up an exam(only lasted few months to D-day) and I was in extreme grief. What's worse, I suddenly got pimples all around my face, then my wall totally broke down. I felt stress from both physically and mentally.
After the exam, I was having my summer vacation, and clearly I was not in a mood. I blocked myself and rarely made contact with others. This lasted till my first term ended at my college.
These things force me to look like a hedgehog, I sometimes hurt people to protect myself being hurt. I just feel no security.
And I do feel up&amp;down sometimes, I can't help it.
I really don't want to hurt my friends, I want to change it. Being suffered by it makes me hard, though.

32,"I would like a name to what is wrong with me. I think I’m paranoid but I also just know I’m scared, like 24/7. In the back of my mind something will happen. When I run upstairs, I feel like someone is behind me about to grab my legs from underneath me. When I take the dog out, I feel like any second I will hear someone or hear footsteps or see someone along the trees. I have fear in the corner of my eye. I can numb it with daily life but at the end of the day, when I have nothing else to drown it out, I am afraid. I have loneliness issues which bring on depression, I feel like it is in part due to the fact that if I’m alone, I feel vulnerable. When walking on the road, I walk on the side facing away from cars; i have the idea that one day a driver will have enough and take it out on me... I don’t wanna see it coming. I have lots more to example from... but don’t to the point, I am scared. I sometimes wonder if it’s easier to just go. To escape this feeling. People laugh at me when I explain what I’m scared of.

33,"Hello everyone, I made a new alternative account to stay anonymous and find help with what I believe has become a serious issue in my life and will only get worse. 

I don't want to sound ridiculous or make any assumptions but I want to detail symptoms and explain why I think I have a disorder. 

I've isolated almost everyone from my life, even my best friends. I legitimately believed everyone had a negative opinion of me and I felt guilty for ever sharing my life with anyone. I broke up with my ex girlfriend because I was constantly paranoid. I often get extremely frustrated and take it out on myself physically. My parents are going through a number of issues too, and I believe that some specific events have caused me to develop said disorder. Such events are personal but part of it. My family also has a history of violence in my household that scarred me as a child. Ever since the problems with my parents began I've been experiencing what some people have explained to me as ""depersonalization"". I feel out of touch with my life, my family, my surroundings. I feel like I'm living in a different environment than I used to but I'm in the same house with the same family and same bullshit as before, but ever since things got really bad this happens. 

I dont know I'm really worried and scared. I guess any time I've talked to anyone else about it they've denied the idea of me being ill. One close friend said ""if you're crazy you dont know it"" but so many factors have led to me being constantly suffering in my head. I really want to know my next best course of action from here. I would greatly appreciate any help at all, a dm would be helpful if you required more specific information or had any specific questions. Thank you all.",28Oct2018,1
34,"I'm having a hard time explaining to my husband that being mentally ill is part of who I am. He always says that I ""fall back on it a lot"" if I say I can't help if I'm mentally ill. Today for instance I had a really good day, and we were discussing how good our lives are, and it went like this, M for me H for husband.

M ""we have a pretty sweet life don't we?""

H ""we do. You just need to learn how to enjoy it.""

M ""I do. Just sometimes I don't enjoy anything, no matter how good our life is. I can't help it. I can't help if I'm mentally ill. 

H ""you fall back on that a lot don't you? Just enjoy it. It's not that hard.""

M ""being mentally ill is part of who I am. As much as my fingers and toes. It's part of my identity. It's part of who I am.""

H *eyeroll*

He doesn't seem to accept that it is me. That I can't control who I am. I can medicate all I want but at the end of the day I am bipolar. I get depressed. I have major anxiety. It is me. I am it. But is it really? I don't even know anymore.

36,"It makes me feel like I'm shopping for adventure holidays! I hate adventure holidays. They are just advertising their ""treatment methods"" and say how it's a progress and journey to change something, implying that you want to change something, to work on yourself, to get better, that you don't hate yourself. Honestly, if that was the case, I probably wouldn't need you, because I wouldn't be depressed. I just wish I was dead. That's all. No one advertises that.

And then I failed to set up or had to cancel appointments multiple times because they just wouldn't understand why it's so difficult for me to share my phone number or accept calls. They also don't understand that I am very uncomfortable about having to move the appointment multiple times before we had the first one. That I feel rejected and see that as a subtle message that they don't want to talk to me? How fucked up must I be when people don't want to talk to me even if I offer them money?

Maybe it's my fault that I'm just incompatible and immature. I don't see how I can keep up with the expectations that therapists put on me. All I have is a psychiatrist that I see four times a year.

38,"About 2 years ago, I asked r/mentalhealth if it's possible to actively delete specific memories. The general consensus was ""no"". I'm starting to believe that is not true.

I have a set of specific memories which, for a long time, caused me panic attacks, and paranoia. At the time of asking about deleting memories, there was one comment that stuck with me. It was about the art of distraction. The commenter said that everytime a specific memory started creeping in, they just drowned it out with a buzzing sound in their mind.
I took this theory, and adapted it. Every time one of those memories started playing, I would try to focus only on what my eyes could see, rather than the image playing in my head.
At first the memories actually increased, because my brain knew I was actively trying to get rid of them. For the first few months, I would have to try to shut them out at least 5 times a day. But, I kept at it. After a while, I noticed they were slowing down, when I got better at catching them before they manifested. Now 2 years later, sometimes a week will go by, and I will think to myself ""oh yea, I haven't been thinking about it"".

I'm a much happier person now. I used to be really fucking grumpy. I was scared about who I had become. I was always quite a friendly guy, yet I was always shy, and introverted. 2 years ago, when I asked about deleting memories, I was at a point where I had become extremely angry. I was just a grumpy piece of shit.

Now 2 years on, I'm possibly the happiest I've ever been. I'm a lot more confident, funny, and for the first time in my life, I can say that I am no longer an introvert.

40,"I just want to share my experience, which I think is a strange one. I feel like I belong to the 'mental health' community, as well as to the autistic community, because I was diagnosed with several disorders as a child. However, I haven't been impacted by these issues much since I became an adult. I am currently 25 years old.

I was a difficult child. VERY angry and very scared. I lashed out at people. Even at age 18 I was still throwing screaming fits at my parents, and at teachers. I went to a special needs school. I was even in a mental health hospital for a year when I was 15. Was diagnosed with McDD, ADHD, NLD and Aspergers at different points in my life.

MCDD is like BPD meets autism. It's a very controversial diagnosis. Some doctors don't believe that the disorder exists and almost no one has heard of it. 

When I was 16 I was horrible. I drank, did all kinds of drugs and slept around. I was so depressed and unhappy, and filled with anxiety. 

My whole childhood was a deep, dark, unhappy hole. I was bullied, I didn't have friends, and I had serious issues that caused me to lash out in anger and act out in various ways.

My autism made it difficult for me to connect to people. I often said very rude things that others of my age would know are not the right things to say at a given moment. 

I am now, however, a relatively well-adjusted adult. I moved in with my dad and my stepmom when I was 18. It was a big adjustment, cause my dad has some of the same issues that I had. He said that we were both 'emotionally immature' people, and I agree with that. I think we learned a lot from each other. 


Now I am 25. I am often praised for my politeness and sometimes my mom jokes that I am *too* polite. I think I overdo it a little, but I don't want to say the wrong things anymore. I now recognize which things are rude and which are not. I get a lot of my manners from period dramas and interacting with old people (not in a neckbeard way. I don't say 'm'lady' or take off my hat for people). Because those old etiquette rules seem easy to follow and seem to get a pleasant reaction out of people.


I don't get angry anymore, except when a device isn't working. Then I kind of freak out and get pissed. I never lash out at the people around me. I never manipulate people and I try to tell as few lies as possible (everyone lies sometimes, so I won't say that I never do). 


I do have some anxiety and depression issues, but it is more internalized. I don't abuse drugs, I am in a committed relationship. I have friends. 

I still see a psychiatrist and use Neurotonin (Gabapentin) for my anxiety, but I only see her once a month. 

I don't know what happened. I don't know where I fit in anymore. Like I said, I still feel like I am a member of the mental health community, but in the last 6 years or so I haven't had the issues related to all the diagnoses I got. Sometimes I worry that those issues will come back to haunt me.

43,"I'm turning 18 in a couple of months, and as far as I'm aware there's no history of mental illness in my family. I've always been physically healthy, excluding some food allergies I had when I was very young. I don't really want to bother any professionals with this, since it's not really a problem, as much as it's an inconvenience. But I would like to know if I'm just going through some normal teenage stuff, or if there's something more serious behind it.

This is not a new thing, but it has gotten significantly worse recently. I have some thoughts, that think I'm not supposed to have. I'm not going to describe all of them, only the ones that bother me the most. So here it goes:

I often get the overwhelming feeling, that I'm not home. I fear that I'm kidnapped, and a bunch of people are pretending to be my family members. I know that it can't possibly be true, but I can't help but run out for 2-3 hours whenever it happens. When I come back home, I make sure to check the mailbox, the trees in the yard, and our car's license plate, in order to make sure I'm at my own house. 

I can read something out loud, but unless I was pushing my left thumb, pointer, and middle finger together, I have to read it again to make sure I understood it. Usually I have to read everything multiple times, making this perhaps the most problematic of my thoughts, since it can become quite time consuming. 

I sometimes have trouble telling dreams and reality apart. I once had a dream in which I was raped, and it took me months to convince myself that it was just a dream, even though the rape started in a dark room, and was suddenly in the middle of Broadway. 

Even before that dream, I've always found everything sex related quite repulsive and really uncomfortable. This has led to irrational fears, such as people putting semen in my food. This usually leads to inability to enjoy that food, or I just simply can't eat it. Again, I know that it's no ones lacing my food with their sperm, but I can't help myself. 

Just like everyone else, I did some embarrassing things when I was 10 or 12 or whatever. I'm sure everyone looks back at their past mistakes and thinks: ""damn, I was dumb."" Whenever I look back at my mistakes, I get a nagging irrational fear about how literally every single person on this planet knows about those mistakes, and treat me differently because of that. 

I'm somewhat smart. I used to be really smart for my age when I was younger, but nowadays I'm pretty average. However, in school I feel like everyone is pretending to be dumb, to make me feel smarter. As if everyone in that school is part of a weird, useless conspiracy. 

Often when laying in bed, I feel bugs crawling on my skin, but there's never any bugs. This is quite common I'd imagine, but I'm throwing it in anyway. 

The list of weird thoughts goes on and on, but you get the point. I (as someone who knows next to nothing about mental health) have suspected OCD, or the scarier, but very unlikely option of schizophrenia. Someone who actually knows about this stuff could tell me if I have something to worry about, or if it's normal for teenagers. 

Also, I'm not a native English speaker, and I often worry about my redundant use of commas, (there it is again) so if I'm using it too much, let me know.

Im 19 years old, University Student studying Computer Science. Whatever this is, its really not a new thing. I think I've been like this for a long time but recently its gotten worse. I doubt myself all the time and I don't feel like i can join in and enjoy myself because I'm an embarrassment and no one wants me to speak to them. I don't speak to people in uni, I'm afraid to make new friends and meet people and i cling on to people i already know, afraid that they'd slip away. Even when people spark a conversation its just awkward and I stutter.

It started a few years ago, i used to be very passionate about making music every single day but I stopped thing it was pathetic and futile to keep going. I've became incredibly sluggish, slow and lazy only doing things when they get in my way. Sometimes i just stay in bed until 4-5 in the afternoon and only get out when i feel hungry. I feel pathetic and annoying to other people so i don't like chasing them down or even speaking to them. I shouldnt be crying all over my girlfriend being really clingy and begging her to solve my problems but i do and it makes me cringe. I have had couple suicidal thought but it would just hurt the people close to me.

Last night me and my girlfriend went to a halloween party and i kept isolating myself because she speaks to her friends and i don't have any there. I do join in i just cringe and either walk away or dont speak because i didn't fit in. I got angry this morning because of last night and i thought my girlfriend didn't care. This is affecting my 3 year relationship in a HUGE way (this is mainly why i want to get help). Its making trust issues with me because she has a few friends that are boys and I get jealous. I feel like she doesn't care and that I don't mean anything to her anymore because she doesn't act as seriously when she does. I know she is happy but i always doubt it.

47,"Hello all! I will try to make this nice and short. I have been on lexapro 20mg for about 5 years with great success. However, I recently had been constantly tired, sleeping 10 hours at night, and 3 hours during the day. I got blood work and a sleep study, all negative, so i suspected my medication. This had made things difficult, so i decided to talk to my doctor, who recommended reducing the dose to 15mg. This had went well for the most part, but i began to feel foggy, so he recommended switching to prozac. Here is how he switched me:

Week 1: 15mg lexapro, 20 mg prozac

Week 2: 10mg lexapro, 20 mg prozac

Week 3: 5mg lexapro, 20 mg prozac

Week 4: 20 mg prozac only

I have been on 20mg prozac only for \~1 weeks, and it has been hell. I have had insomnia, increased depression/anxiety, but most severely, I have had intense brain fog. I have trouble remembering anything. I am in my final year of physical therapy school, in my final clinical rotation, and it has 100% affected my performance. I struggle with simply remembering what my patients have already done, remembering their names, remembering techniques I have learned, etc. 

I am thinking this intense brain fog is mostly due to coming off the lexapro so quickly after being on it for so long, combined with a small amount of prozac side effects. 

Sooo, my question is this: Do i stick it out with the prozac and hope my body gets used to it? Do i jump from 20mg of prozac to 40mg (my doctor said it is up to me?), Or do i go back to taking my 20mg of lexapro, and gradually tapering my medication properly using the 10% rule. I am leaning to doing this, but feel terrible, as its like I am addicted to these medications to simply function. But at the same time, this is the most important part of my young career, as succeeding in clinical rotation leads to job offers and is necessary to even graduate. I have called and left a message for my psychiatrist, but after he tapered me so fast, i do not necessarily want to blindly listen to him without researching myself.

54,"I am so SICK of people misusing the word triggered in EVERYDAY LIFE. If there's some sort of insensitive bullshit online, and someone calls them out for it,  the immeadeate response of the people is ""wow she's TRIGGERED!!!!!"". MILD DISCOMFORT OR OFFENSE IS NOT WHAT TRIGGERED MEANS. If I respond like this to them,  they accuse me of being ""triggered"". Triggered means when a stimulus of some sort,  a sound, taste, feeling,  sight etc. brings on (or triggers) memories or feelings of trauma. When people are being obnoxious about suicide(usually talking about it), that triggers me, usually causing me to have an anxiety attack. That's what being triggered is.  But if I said that to your average person they would immediately go off on one. Because it's a meme.  And no it's not having mental health be less stigmatized, it's making a crude overused joke of mental health,  and I'm sick of it.

I am a 20 year old boy, currently studying at a university. To be fair, I am doing very well for myself; no financial issues, good friends, a loving family and great hobbies and health. 

However, I am quite rarely satisfied, and struggle with looking at the bright side of things. I deal with a lot of regrets relating to stupid things I have done, even though the issues have been resolved and are not too bad in the first place. Additionally, I struggle with motivation. I absolutely love boxing, and it is a huge part of my life. Every time I train, I feel awesome and I love it. However, I still dread turning up to practices and make excuses for not coming. 

I am very prone to bad memories, and focus too much on them. For example, every time I drink, I almost never have good memories from it, even though I had a great time. 

I was in a relationship with a girl I hade no feelings for, and it ended up ruining our friendship (mostly because I found out I didn't like her too much anyways). We have made up, and all is forgiven, but I still struggle with things I've said and done. I don't know how to move on and get over it. 

My self confidence is generally good, but I care very much about how other people percieve me. This is the basis of most of my regrets. 

To be fair, I don't really know what I'm asking for. I want to improve myself, but I don't really know how. I know for a fact that I should drink less, I have started listening to self-improvement podcasts, but I still want to change how I percieve the past and get a more positive view on life.

57,"This was always the question for me - it's why I could never get along with CBT.  I've definitely had situations in my life where there was a lot of gaslighting going on, and a lot of reinforcement from people who were outside (is unonscious gaslighting even a thing?).  And I feel like the distortion examples I always got in CBT sound almost identical to the reasons I was given why the abuse was all in my head.  Things like:
 - They're not *always* like that, you're just making it out to be black and white.
 - You can't read their mind, so you can't know that they have negative motivations.
 - You're saying they ""should"" do this or that, and that's setting yourself up for failure because you can't control other people.

I could never get an explanation out of any therapist what the difference was.  The closest I got was that you could ask other people for feedback - but again, I've been in abusive situations with little contact with others outside of the situation, or where others were reflecting back that it can't be that bad or I must be misunderstanding somehow.",28Oct2018,1

I was never diagnosed with ADHD in my early years, but in talking with my psychologist recently, she says that I display many of the signs and symptoms that adult women with ADHD display. She also mentioned that there’s a very high chance I was never diagnosed because I didn’t display the hyperactivity symptoms that pediatricians often look for.

All of the diagnostic services in my area appear to be for children. Where should I begin to look for diagnostic help for adults? Are there services available for adults who may be suffering from ADHD? I believe it will help me significantly with my work life if I were to get some answers.

61,"Hello!

Since a few months I started to withdraw from venlafaxine slowly because I was convinced and still am that they don't work as I thought. 
Despite withdrawal symptoms I didn't experience anything psychologically.

But since last month, I feel like I am more aroused and also less tired, but I feel more tense.   My sexual orientation is more confused than ever.   I always thought that I am gay but now I am not sure anymore, BECAUSE now I became nauseous sometimes when I watch gay porn or think about having a relationship with a guy.      

When I imagine myself together with a girl, I don't feel repulsed.  BUT I also CANNOT get sexually aroused and get a boner when I watch a straight porn and a girl striptease.  It's kind of boring to me.    I find that girls look damn hot and beautiful, but sexually they are boring to me.    Until the last month I also did find some boys beautiful and sexy and also sexually attractive but now I don't.
   

Sometimes when I feel comfortable  I still can get horny with gay porn and think about kissing a boy, but now I feel more inhibited with these thoughts and automatically get nauseated.  But I don't know why.


I also feel extremely uncomfortable in gay clubs especially when guys older than 25 years ask me for a drink and wanna dance with me.  I feel extremely NAUSEATED and DISGUSTED when I think about it.

But on other times I enjoy it when 2 cute guys (not older than 21 years) are kissing.   I feel so damn disoriented. 
  When a boy and a girl are kissing, I find it damn boring and it doesn't give me any feelings, is that normal?!?!?!?!


Can I blame the antidepressants?  I have to say that these medications definitely have changed my perception, and maybe my sexual attractions too.  I also did think less and felt slightly more disinhibited. 
I still take a really small dosage of venlafaxine, around 12mg.  
But with this dosage I might have lost the ""ROSE-COLERED GLASSES"" that the medication has caused in higher dosage.


So what should I do?  I feel more asexual now.  I cannot feel real sexual attractions to girls and boys.  
I also feel more physical tension and not as comfortable as before.

Just seeing how much people avoid me, even when I text them the night before. Only to see them the next day just going about life like you never even messaged anything.

But for them to just ignore me, I guess they just want me to ""see what it feels like"", when I disappear.  
I tell this friend that has been my friend since middle school ish time, that when I do not talk it is because I am not doing well mentally. Seems she just wants to use my methods against me which makes me feel even worse.

17yo male

My  memory is really bad and I feel like I am not in control. Life is just  like a really foggy event that I can't remember much of. Whenever people  tell me stories of events that have happened just a few years ago I  don't remember them at all. This feeling is really eating away at my  already not very good mental health and just feels strange. I don't  remember if I have always had this problem or if it has started at some  point.

TL;DR: Bad memory, feel like I am just along for the ride not in control.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a reply to a question that I was asked on my previous post aswell:

&amp;#x200B;

Have you had any traumatic experiences?

 

I wasn't abused or anything like that but I  didn't have a good household aswell. Lived alone with my mother and the  men she chose were usually alcoholics and I don't remember if they were  actually abusive, I guess that is the good side of this shit memory.  Although I do remember the times where shit got so intense that I had  breakdowns, remember even threatening one of my stepdads to leave using a  kitchen knife during one of these. I have a little brother aswell so  him being in that environment made me feel pretty bad, I think the time I  threatened one of my stepdads with a knife was when my brother started  crying hysterically. I just fucking snapped and wanted to stab that  fucker. I don't think I have even thought about this that in-depth  before, I think I am more fucked up from that than I thought. Some  strong emotions connected to those events. Luckily due to my shit memory  I have to dig to access those memories, they aren't just floating  around.

I've  now been living with my father for 2 years but he wasn't there much  prior to this so we don't really have a connection or anything. I feel  like all of this shit is what made me not be able to be affectionate  aswell.",28Oct2018,1
66,"Hi guys. I will try to be explanative although I would like to not spend too much time on writing this post... and this is already a contradiction...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my early 20s, my background is a childhood with few affection and daily (I really mean daily) fights with my parents, as well as being relatively poor (I say relatively because I'm from a *supposedly* developed country in Europe and most people have pretty much comfortable lives but when growing up I lacked many times what other people had so even though I could live with water, a clean and warm place to sleep in and enough money to go to school and have some pleasures, I had to take public transportation without tickets and when I got something I liked, like a new videogame or console, my parents would sell it after a few months because of lack of money... and this made me very angry and hurt all the time as well as seeing my peers getting gifts and stuff that I couldn't get).

&amp;#x200B;

During my teenage years I kinda fought against all kinds of psychological problems that arose from my bad childhood. It took years but I learned to manage my emotions much better, although the problems aren't totally gone now.

One year ago I moved to another (richer) country to work and I just quit my IT job because I never felt welcome among the people there as I was younger than everybody else and didn't know how to do many trivial things like cooking for myself and the others were making jokes about me and just making my life harder.  In a few days I'm gonna go back to my home country (which I hate because I always felt out of place and don't see myself in the general culture of the people). I'm not angry about going back because I will see my friends and I will search for another job in some other country.

&amp;#x200B;

The problems that I still have and I think are problems (maybe they are not, after all?) are:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm super proud although I try to be humble with everybody. I use this as some sort of defense against the outside world. My ""natural"" behavior is always different than that of other people and I chose that I will not adhere to how the majority of people around me are doing things just because they are the majority. I'm gonna believe in myself and my way of doing things and will fight for it. For that, I'm suffering often. But why should I become like them? Why don't THEY become like me? I have no problem with how they're doing things, I just ask to be respected and that they let me do things my way.

I have maximum respect for everybody around me, but as soon as somebody turns against me I see them as enemies (going from an extreme to the other, let's say...)

I have the feeling that everything is getting worse. The political and economical situation of our contemporary times has an influence on me, unfortunately. I'm trying to get that influence to the lowest level possible but there are some things I don't have control on, like the tendency of all prices to increase and all processes to become more expensive/complicated .

Related to that above, I hate spending money. Even though now I have, in my opinion, plenty of money, I don't want to spend much of it because I feel that I have to save it so that I will use it to be able to find a city or country in which I will feel more at home with the people's culture. Side note, my parents this month asked me for money twice because they don't have it and I already have to spend money for moving and closing all accounts and shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I will now tell you a real-life example of what happened to me today and what got me to write here. It will look very trivial and stupid, but I felt bad afterwards and that's why I'm looking for help to not feel that bad again for stupid stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had to meet a person at 4pm to transfer my gym membership to them so that I wouldn't have to pay 4 more months without going to the gym (remember I'm moving out of the city). At 3:45 I realize my bike is parked far from my place because I used it a few days before. I send a message to the person to tell them I will be 5-10 minutes late, saying I'm sorry for this. I run under the rain to get to the bike at 3:55, while doing that I drop my phone and crack the screen (never mind, I wanted to change it anyway soon, but it isn't really a pleasurable thing...). I cycle like crazy to get to the place between 4:05 and 4:10. I meet the person and say that I'm sorry.

Now, I don't know if it's me making up things or it was the reality, but I think she was looking at me as if I'm weird. We walk to the gym counter and I ask for the gym membership transfer. The gym person tells me ""there are a few changes"" to the process. So now I have to pay 10 euros (that they will forcefully subtract from my bank account) just because the gym chain is fucking greedy and looking to make more money out of innocent people with no reason whatsoever. That's when I started to get angry as fuck. The gym person was also looking at me in a weird way.

We do the transfer and I get out and feel like shit because against my will they're gonna take money away from me. I feel like all the effort I did is for nothing. In my mind I have thoughts rushing everywhere and in anger I desperately try to find ways to not give them the money that they don't deserve and are gonna take from me forcefully. At the same time I know it's not worth the effort for 10 euros. But I feel like I lost again. The gym can get my money without even asking and I can't do anything against them so I lost. I know all of this is stupid, I know I should delete all that happened from my mind and just go on with my life but it's unfair. I feel as if the whole world is against me and people treat me unfairly. I want to treat everybody with respect but something tells me that I should really become a bad person and do bad to people as they do with me.

Its not due to ridicule from straight people oddly enough as everyone straight (friends and family) I have come out to have been so supportive.. Its ridicule from other gay people that angers and depresses me and the isolation that i feel.

Gay people as a whole tend to be very judgemental and belittling which is ironic because you would think a group of people who have been so marginalized would be more accepting, no? But that is not the case. Gay men especially and much of the lgbt community are very fixated on superficial qualites. If u dont fit the stereotypical image of what they believe the ideal gay man should be then they want nothing to do with you. They piss and moan about acceptance yet they can't even accept each other.

Additonally, gay men feel that they are entitled to be disrespectful and act however they want because they feel society owes them something for being gay.  Everything revolves around their sexuality and feel the need to throw it in everyones faces. They are fixated with sleeping around and going clubbing at the local gay bars well into their fourties, have no desires to settle down, are obsessed with the hookup culture like its a status thing. So many of them are into drugs and have STD's. 

I don't fit into any of those categories so I am inconsistently put down and ignored. The only way to try and meet people or date as a gay person (unless u live in a big city) is online and all they ever do is block me or say horrible thing like ""go die of aids"" because im not like them or look a certain way.

This is were the isolation sets in... Although i have support from straight people i cant really relate to them and they cant relate to my situation because my sexual orientation is different plus at my age almost every straight person i know is married so we are at different phases of our lives and i obviously cant connect or relate to other gay people so i feel so alone... Not to mention when i see all of these people my age getting married and buying houses and stuff i get depressed because i have never even had a Valentine's and i want to be able to have hapiness like they have but i cant.

Everytime i get rejected and belittled by a gay man i get so angry and hateful that i shake and wish somthing bad would happen to them.

77,Lately I have discussed terrible suicidal thoughts and how I can't sleep because of them with my therapist. The shock on her face really made me feel like I shouldn't have told her. She quickly took action saying she wished I'd come in once a week instead of every two weeks. This is not a money issue because I pay next to nothing with a scale price. Should I be worried she may send me somewhere to get help? I want to be honest with her but I feel like I'm digging a hole for myself. ,28Oct2018,1
78,"This is going to be a list of behaviors. Im not sure how to TL:DR this post.. I would appreciate and help or kind words you guys can offer to help me make this easier on my family.. I would like to start off by saying that my mother has been like this since I can remember. We had brought her to specialists in the past but she would never stick to any plans long enough to benefit from the help of the professional at all. I am 18 and I have spent my entire life at home with my parents who fight almost every day because of my mothers fixations and delusions. Here is a list of things that my mother does, or used to do.

What she Used to: 
- Cover LED's around the house with tape because she thought people could spy on us through them
- Use special hand signals to me to indicate if a roomin our house was/was not safe to go into.
- Create a strip of paper,electrical tape, and scotch tape to tape over her nostrils. She would remove in quickly whenever we were near her in order to hide it from us. She made some many that she would lose them around the house and we would find them.
- accuse my father of being a literal robot and reading her mind.

What she still does:
- Colors the outer tips of foam earplugs black and sticks them up her nostrils. I believe the black marker is to make it so that we don't notice them in her nose.
- Constantly wears those wax earplugs for swimming in her ears and tries to hide them. She is not sensitive to noises and these earplugs stop her from hearing important noises throughout the day, or even us calling her from a few meters away.
- Bangs on walls, bathtubs, or anything she can get her hands on when she things we aren't listening.
- Uses our printer paper to wrap almost every box in the house, even books, scissors, and random objects tightly. Its hard to find things because printer paper ain't see through. 
- Rips the labels off of most things. She has voided a lot of warrantys and ruined a lot of hardware by removing these labels. She used to store these labels in a folder but I haven't seen it for years. 
- she can be heard talking to herself when she is alone. ""Why are you here"", ""Get out of my house"", ""Are you watching me?"".
- Will often come up to me or my father and say things such as: ""Am I doing something wrong?"", ""Am I supposed to do something that you're not telling me?"", ""Are you watching me"".
- She complains about when she opens a door and there happens to be a plane flying above our house, or if a car goes by. If she hears a car go by our house she will say in a very angry tone ""What was that?! Are you kidding me?""
- She will often ask us if we are reading her mind.
- She can be heard making demonic sounding voices like in the movies while she's In her room.
- She will complain if you happen to be in the same place as her at the same time as if you are following her.
- She will constantly claim that her belongings are going missing and that there is some sort of being in the house that wants to punish her and is taking her things. She tries to blame my father and I for taking her stuff. Often times she just misplaces her items, but this is what will lead to her and my dads arguments 9 times out of 10. She will tell at my dad and tell him that he knows something and that he is in contact with some sort of being in order to ruin her life. (He makes $120 per hour, works full time, and provides for us, she does not have a job). basically she just always thinks something is stealing from her.

There are many more odd things that she does, but before making the list longer I really need some feedback. Thanks for your time. I don't want to degrade my mother by posting this, but I've run out of resources.",28Oct2018,1
79,"I had a bit of a bad morning. The ""blinds down, doors shut, nobody talk to me"" kind. Things were clearing up a bit in the afternoon untill I went to the bathroom after dinner. I opened the medicine cabinet and took a look at what kind of stuff we have: Naproxen, Aspirin, some anti-diarrhoea medication etc. and a massive, unopened jar of 200 Paracetamol, 500mg each. I googled the lethal dose, figured half the bottle would be more than enough to kill me and poured myself a handfull of the stuff and some water. And then I just kind of sat there, staring at it, thinking that I could kill myself right now if I so wished. I wouldn't have to worry about my spanish test or handing in that teachers note. In fact, I wouldn't have to worry about anything ever again. I could go out into the woods. Nobody would ever find me. I'd just be dead, free from everything. And it felt so good. 

Let me be clear that I have no intention af actually going through with this, especially not by overdose where so much can go wrong and your death will probably be slow and painfull but sitting there with all the tools ready was just the best feeling ever.

At school, I am a completely different person in terms of my actions. I don't really want to write a whole autobiography, but I will list the horrible things I have done that qualify me to be ""fucked in the brain"" as well as some background information about my past that may or may not have contributed to my present state.

&amp;#x200B;

Bad/Questionable Things I have Done

\- I used to steal things when I was really little (kindergarten to first grade)

\-I've been compulsively lying and fabricating stories since I've been in kindergarten. For example, when I was little I told everyone I was going on a Disney cruise. Nowadays, my compulsive lying consists of taking a story that really happened and twisting it so the story I am telling seems more interesting/funny. I used to lie online a lot, about my age and fabricate my life story to seem more interesting. 

\- In 2nd grade I threatened my ""best friend"" that I would cut her head off with a chainsaw if she didn't hang out with me. I would cry a lot in class if I didn't get my way and I was very clingy towards this one girl who was my ""best friend""

\-I used to physically fight other girls a lot in 3rd-5th grade.

\-I used to dress like a guy and have my hair cropped (2nd-5th grade).

\-In middle school I was a perfectionist

\-When I was 12 (seventh grade) I was hospitalized for anorexia from Sept-Nov 2014.

\-During my Anorexia recovery I started disrespecting my parents really badly, I hit them, yelled, called CPS, swore, had tantrums and meltdowns all in effort to not restore the weight I worked hard on loosing.

\-I am pretty smart, it has always been acknowledged by teachers I have high cognitive abilities, produce quality work and understand things very easily. 

\-Motivation issues

\- I skip school a lot

\-I go to bed really late

\- I am a black and white person, all or nothing mentality. For example, I am fasting and if I mess up my fast with a bit of food I go all out and binge. OR, say I get high marks on a bunch of tests, I get a shitty mark on one, I feel that I have failed and will stop trying. 

\-I threaten suicide when I am trying to communicate stress ( I have been doing this since I was young)

\-I have scratched my arms up with knives/burnt myself with candles to communicate to my parents I am stressed

\-I have a very hard time verbalizing feelings

\- I bottle things up

\-I have always been insecure (dating back to first grade). I secretly care about what others think of me.

\-I will avoid an event if my personal situation isn't exactly ""perfect""

\-I have self control issues with internet, food, a lot of things.

 \-This past Friday night I tried to commit suicide by drinking myself to death (drank a whole mickey of bacardi gold with my  girl friends, there was 4 of us no guys don't worry) I blacked out and barfed, friends called 911, stomach got pumped, I was sent home.

\-I do not handle stress easily.

\-I do not verbalize my feelings and I am not annoying/do not get attached easily. I like to think people like me, but I can be cold/calculating unless I am drunk.

\-I ran away from home and slept downtown at McDonalds for a night because my parents were very cross with me and I couldn't take it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Upbringing/Things That Happened to me in the past

\- My Mom kicked my Dad when she was pregnant with my youngest brother and called the cops on him for no reason when I was 4. They were separated for 3 months, they are back together though.

\-My Mom used to threaten to leave me and my siblings and my father when we were little when she was angry/stressed/didn't get her way.

\-My mom used to compare me to other girls (especially on my looks) and make fun of me. I recall in second grade we were dress shopping for my holy communion (mom and grandma were both there)and I picked out a dress and she didn't like, luckily grandma liked it so she bought it for me. She made fun of the dress all the way home and constantly until the day of my communion. 

\- I used to hear my parents having loud sex when I was younger and it really affected me and fucked up my sense of sexuality ( I had a giant fear of sex for a long time)

\-My mom has always found something to pick on about me, she says I am worse now, but this has been going on before I started skipping school and binge drinking. 

\-My father smashes my things and breaks stuff when he is angry

\-My father beat me with an electrical cord last year because I was up at 2am on a school night finishing my science fair project 

\-In seventh grade my father dragged me by the hair and kicked me over and over after me and my mom fought over what I was eating/anorexia recovery (I called CPS after this incident btw but nothing came out of it)

\-My parents were/are emotionally unavaliable. I used to tell my mom I was sad/angry and she would tell me to be tough and suck it up, she instilled the idea in me that feeling feelings make you 'weak' and that everyone is out to emotionally manipulate you if they know the true you. 

\-My mom used to bitch at my dad constantly for new rennovations to our house (bc we live in an outdated house) and bitch at him for not spending all his money like everyone else (my dad is very hardworking and savvy)

\-We did family therapy and my counselor said me and my mom have a toxic relationship.

\-My mom has called me a psychopath and a narcissist many times, she says I am extremely self interested and selfish. She says I have a victim complex.

83,"I’m so confused about whether or not I have mental health issues and what they are. 

I used to have anxiety about 6 years ago, but I went to therapy and that helped a lot. But now I think it’s coming back, but way different. Or it’s something else(depression/bipolar or maybe just really self conscious).

I’m always stressed about something and I let it get to the point where I break down crying and it’s just a cycle of that constantly. 

There’s days where I’m so happy and everything goes right, but then there’s days where I feel sad  and like I’m always on the verge of tears. On those sad days I’m always thinking about how I’m never good enough for my family or friends and how I’m never pretty enough or smart enough. 

I get so nervous to eat in front of other people, that I’m pretty much starving all day until I get home. I think it’s because my family makes fun of me, calling me a pig anytime they see me eating. I know this isn’t a good habit, but I just can’t get over it. 

I can tell my friends know somethings up, they’re always asking if I’m sad or what’s wrong.  And I know if they ask the right questions, I’m going to break down and it’ll all come out. 

I’ve broken down twice over the past day and I just want it to be over with. To get over this feeling, whenever my nails are long I’ll scrape at my arms, but it only helps for a little bit.

I’m probably not explaining this right, but here’s a video that pretty much explains how I feel:

It is a bit unusual because although I have dealt with some bad anxiety in the past it has never been like this.

It's been really hard to talk about what I did to find myself here, but being honest about it is the only way I'm going to come to terms with what happened.13 days ago I found myself in a deep depression. Things were really hard at home, work was miserable, and all around I felt like I wasn't doing well enough at anything at life. I hadn't accomplished my goals for my 25th year. I thought I’d have my bachelors and a baby right now, but things just didn't seem to be going the way I wanted to and being bipolar isn't helping.I was up late that Thursday night, even though I had a big event at work I was planning happening the next day. I just didn't care. I had been drinking often for the last month, when I usually only drank once a month. Coupled with my anxiety meds, that clearly say do not drink with alcohol as they may slow your breathing, I was still feeling super on edge. So being impulsive, I took two more, and had another drink. Followed by two more and another drink, and two more again.I was slowly slipping out of reality as my world started coming to a halt. I could feel my body slowing down, my brain was screaming at me that things weren't okay. Once I started loosing consciousness, I called the ambulance. I told them I had overdosed. What was embarrassing was that my husband, who is also in the military, is a cop. His coworkers had to respond to our house as he slept upstairs.Once I was transported to the ER, which I worked at, talk about embarrassing, I was almost completely gone. I blacked out a few minutes later. I woke up 5 hours later, my husband at my side. He asked me why I did what I did. I just didn't have the answer to that. I don't know why I did what I did. I was always so careful with my medication. I knew the consequences. Even I was confused. All I could say was I just wanted to be numb. I still, 12 days later, cant come up with why exactly I did what I did. I was in a super depressive episode, that's all I knew.That day I was sent off to the hospital I'm in now. I've learned a lot about myself, when I thought I couldn't be any better as a bipolar adult. I have a sense of clarity and what I need to do. 

That's why I'm here. I hope to be someone other scared bipolar people can relate to and feel comfort from. I want to show you that even though I've been through so much, there is a light at the end. Things eventually get better.",28Oct2018,1

All I’ve know to do my whole life is go to school, on a schedule, and wait for the weekends. I’m afraid of what’s to come, and afraid that there isn’t even any point to anything.

88,"In my programming classes, I did very well (high 80s - 90s), however I have noticed that I am not doing very well in the work force. The other two people that were hired on at the same time as me have been catching on to things much more quickly, and seem to be on the same wavelength as the rest of the team... and I am not.

I go into work, and I am riddled with anxiety. I am paralyzed with the fear of fucking up. I thought that this would be gone by now, but it is the same anxiety that I have experienced every single day ever since I started working there. I try to explain ideas, and it's like my brain turns to mush. When I am asked what I have been working on, I begin grasping at straws trying to remember what I was working on even three minutes ago. My mind becomes complete chaos at work, and it is ruining my career. I have already been criticized for being a little slower to catch on than the rest of them, but this is where I am confused--I did so well in school, but I can't catch on to things at work very quickly? The major issues that they have highlighted are communication issues--and that's true! I do have issues with communicating.

Here are the comments:

""It's like I am speaking to you, and you're just not... understanding.""  
""You don't think things through before you come over and talk to me.""

things like that. I even freak out before I message them on Slack because I think that they are going to pull me into the conference room and lay me off because I am not ""learning fast enough"". In fact, they've already talked about extending my probationary period because I am not ""learning quick enough"", which is odd considering their performance review gave me 3/5 for mostly everything (goes from 0 - 5, 3 is where they expect me to be, apparently).

 I also become paralyzed when tasked with something difficult--it's like I can't make a move because I don't know where to start. If I ask for direction, I fear that they will chastise me for not being competent enough to figure it out for myself.

... which is strange, considering all of my instructors have had nothing short of excellent things to say about me. I was given an ""above average"" performance after my work term, but now it's like my anxiety has completely ruined my fucking brain. And it is pouring over into my daily life--I come home, and feel like a complete and utter failure. I am having meltdowns and increased thoughts of self harm. Sometimes I pull on my hair, punch myself in the head, etc... because of the completely overwhelming intensity of the emotions. I can't control my emotions anymore, and I feel like this place is ruining me.

Last week alone I encountered a bug I couldn't fix and felt like I needed to go to the bathroom before I had a full blown anxiety attack right then and there.

2. Picking skin around my nails. I used to be a nail biter, which I managed to kick in my teens. However, I'm pretty sure since my late teens this has developed into picking the skin around my nails which is much more painful. About a year ago I managed to stop by moisturising my hands whenever I felt the urge to pick but I slipped back and this no longer works. Again, I pick to the point of drawing blood and my fingers are often painful. I very rarely have non-picked skin around my nail beds.
3. Dry skin on the bottom of my foot. This is probably the most gross one. Again since my late teens I have picked the dry skin on the bottom of my foot. Sometimes this goes deep enough that it hurts to walk on my foot. I am worried one day this will get infected.

We are in 8th grade. The “situation” I’m about to talk about was in fifth grade. He’s generally nice and normal. He’s in multiple clubs and has a good friend group.

I’ll add more details if it helps

Now for the situation

In fifth grade home, him and 3 other kids were in a special advanced class. One day he stabbed all of us with a pretty dull pencil. One of the other kids started bleeding... **from being stabbed with a DULL pencil**

* Everything that is happening feels somehow gravely important, like I am in the climax of a movie
* Sounds are louder, and I cant ignore them

Basically, I lose the ability to do anything calmly.  There are no noticeable physical effects, its all in my head.  It lasts, maybe ten-fifteen minutes.  Almost always when I am alone.

96,"Hi all, looking for some advice here. 

I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for most of my life. When I met my husband I was on antidepressants, after dating for a while I was off them, then after we got engaged I needed to start again (I had suffered a miscarriage as well as several other contributing factors). 

Now we are married and trying to have a baby. I stopped taking my medication several months ago bc I didn’t want to be on anything while pregnant. I’m not preg yet, but I definitely feel the darkness of my mental illness and miss being medicated. 

My need for advice comes from this: my husband absolutely recognizes my declining mental health but I feel like he just doesn’t get it. I’m fairly articulate and try to explain it in relatable terms and scenarios to him but I really don’t think he understands. He often tries to give me tough (borderline harsh) love and says things like “I’m just trying to toughen you up” or “this is the real world and you need to learn ___” 

I know he’s trying, and our marriage is lovely otherwise, but it’s just been really hard to get him to empathize. Any advice from others who have experienced an ignorant but well meaning partner? ",28Oct2018,1

I think I have OCD and Bipolar. Of course I don't know really but i know that I am 100% not ""normal"".
 First I thought it was my teen years and hoped it will pass and then when I was 17 I hade panic attacks, severe mood swings,  and would offten have leg cramps.
Had one mayor panic attack in front of my close friends  who were very scared but wanted to help so I decided to go to therapy.  Talked to my dad about  filling stressed, luckily he was very supportive and I want to a terepest and it was nice but I didn't really tell her anything, she thought I  was there because of school( I had a big test for my dream school) and family drama, she did help me with that  but I stopped going just before my test.
New I am 21, and aware that my problems aren't going away.
 
I am scared of being wrongly diagnosed by doctors, but hate that I am reading about mental health all the time, always searching for my symptoms and probably doing it wrong myself. But I don't want to take meds that won't help. 
 
Also I don't know what to expect from my family and friends, I know that they would try to be supportive and help somehow but I know that some would think I am making everything up. 
",28Oct2018,1
98,"I don't know where it all started.

I'm 16. My dad left when I was 2, and I grew up in a trailer park. Eventually my mom got a well-paying job, and was able to afford a suburban home for me and my older sister. I think I probably endured a lot of emotional neglect here; I can't blame my mom, she was doing all she could, but I guess it just wasn't enough. Or maybe it's just me.

I've always done well in school and extracurricular activities. People generally see me as quite composed and well-off. On multiple occasions, though, people have made remarks about my glibness, lack of empathy, etc, which lead me to research the issue.

I get a lot of comments about how I'm kind of a jerk; I agree. I'm constantly manipulating people, and tear others down, both intentionally and not. I make conscious decisions every day on the best ways to build my character in the public eye, all the while despising the majority of the people I surround myself with. It's like there's two of me, the outside caricature and the inside self.

Inside, I battle with anxiety attacks, paranoia, and severe depression on a daily basis. It was worse when I was younger; I'd try to strangle myself until I passed out and had bruises, I'd lash out with anger, and I'd hurt people around me. I think I still do that last one, just not in ways people see. 

For a while, I was able to suppress the depression and anxiety in favor of the 'sociopath' persona. I understand It's unhealthy to diagnose oneself with something like that, but it was the only out I could see. I became a brutally mean person, and although I never get into fights, I express my anger through most of my daily interactions. For the longest time, I'd suppress the voice in my head telling me what I was doing was wrong, that I was hurting people, etc. 

For the last 9 months, I've been on anti anxiety medication. I think this was probably my first step towards doing the right thing. From there, I opened up more to myself about how I needed treatment. However, this lead me into a downward spiral in a depressive episode which left me hospitalized for a short time. With the emotional support of my family, I was able to continue the process of help, and eventually found a therapist. I'm going back for my second appointment tomorrow, and I'll be getting a prescription of anti depressants later this week.

The real problem though, remains. My family now understands that I suffer from depression, anxiety, etc (we have a history of it on my mom's side), but I'm not sure I can ever tell them the extent to which I've gone to suppress these feelings. I've manipulated people for money, pity, and sex.

I think what brought about the whole 'me wanting to get help' thing was the fact that, for the first time, I think I might be in love. She's perfect in every way possible, but I can't commit myself to her. I'm terrified that I'm going to be rejected, or worse, hurt her emotionally.

At this point, I'm not really sure what to do. From all of this, I've learned that I'm a terrible person, and need help, but I feel like I might be getting help for the wrong thing; that is, depression, instead of the underlying sociopathy.
