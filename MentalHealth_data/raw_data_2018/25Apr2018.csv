0,"Just the new most recent revelation in the case of my Nex abuser who assaulted me, threatened me with murder suicide with a cocked/loaded gun and has been stalking and harassing and defaming me for a year...

A friend of mine finally just gave me the evidence of his contact with her (while I was recovering from an injury) and it includes saying that he is receiving threatening messages from an email address I’ve never heard of before and reported it to police. I called the police in his county and no such report was ever even made to them, so he is just using his manufactured EVIDENCE that I’m really the bad guy stalking him to show to people around him. Really sucks we are in same industry with so many mutual contacts though. 

I’m having to enact my safety plan right now of moving and hiding because I’m going to get a real restraining order on him soon (called protection order in my state) and it sucks to be thrown out of my routine. And it sucks that the police in the county he committed the assault in are going to CALL him so they can at least said they got his side in court even though I have all kinds of evidence. But at least the case will FINALLY get to the DA soon...

All I can hope at this point is that things being on record and him actually being held accountable for his actions for ONCE in his life brings this nightmare to an end...

I won’t hold my breath though :( ",25Apr2018,2

2,"A little background information - in 6th grade I was caught self harming by the school counselor and my mom did not handle it well. I received no help at all and I’ve struggled with this for almost five years now.

I’m a 16 y/o girl and for the past year or so I’ve been having hallucinations and delusions. I’ve always been really paranoid. I’ve been checking my room for intruders and locking my door since I was about 12. I also have a loft bed so that no one can hide under it. But it started getting worse freshman year of high school. I heard whispers which escalated into yells and shouts, then I began seeing shadows and people peering around corners and even bugs crawling near or on me.

I endured this for about 6 months. I told no one. Then I decided I had had enough. I told my mother, and she seemed concerned enough I guess. In a few months I was at my first meeting with a psychiatrist. She was nice enough, and we scheduled a second hour long appointment in the following weeks.

Second appointment was not at all like the first. The psychiatrist seemed indifferent and almost rude. Our hour long appointment lasted a little over thirty minutes and she sent me out to sit in the lobby. Keep in mind that she did not have another appointment after mine - she just wanted me gone. I’ve had my mom call back about a dozen times but this woman won’t return any of our calls and so I obviously won’t be going back.

I’ve gone through better and rougher patches since then. From having no hallucinations to seeing a woman on my ceiling over my bed (keep in mind that my loft bed is about 2 feet from the ceiling) trying to pull me into the attic. Or a little girl with bloody lips just staring at me and smiling. Or a face on the back of someone’s head damning me to hell. It’s been difficult some days.

Today I got in trouble for taking a nap after I got home. My mom said that I needed to actually close my eyes and sleep when I go to bed. I told her that I need to see someone soon because my hallucinations have been worsening and she tells me to just deal with it. What? There’s no just dealing with it. I’m losing my fucking mind and she doesn’t care at all.

I was wondering what I can do in my situation. I can’t drive so I can’t go see someone myself. I keep this secret vey well hidden - not even my biological father knows what’s happening. Sorry if there’s any grammatical or spelling errors - I’m too upset to reread this at the moment.",25Apr2018,1
3,"Hi all
Today I had my first apt with a psychiatrist and something she asked me near the end was “do you feel like I’m missing anything?” And while at the time I said no in reflection I really feel like I didn’t explain my issues to the fullest extent. I’m going back next week and I want to be more prepared but all of my symptoms are so hard to explain, I completely lack the language. I’m worried my ineffective communication will result in these problems going without treatment for much longer. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",25Apr2018,2

Very strange mental breakdown, what do you think happened?

Hi. I'm pretty stumped as to what happened to me a few months ago and I'm still recovering from it. I'm actually pretty traumatized from what happened. I felt so dissociated and not myself.. 

So around November - January I suddenly became paranoid, then it led to me feeling hopeless and shit about myself because I was so unmotivated to do anything and it took an immeasurable amount of effort to get on my feel and go to coop. I ended up getting fired for ""lack of effort"" which wasn't true, manager was a bitch but it still affected and made me FEAR getting rejected or thrown away.

 After that, I felt more paranoid around my friends. I used to be super close friends with two girls like myself but another friend came along and I felt like I was not as important anymore since I was the only shy introvert in the group of outgoing confident friends. 

I became too scared to meet them because I'd have to hear questions like, ""why don't you hang with us"" or ""are we even friends"" I caught them talking about me behind my back a couple times and it discouraged me from hanging out with them even more. So to protect myself I threw them away. But during all this stress with being unemployed, not knowing what to do with my life, friends and family looking down on me because I can't find a job or spend time with them. It kept going and escalating and I guess it screwed me up to make me a completely different person.. Its scary.

**
I was pretty confident, I could be outgoing and hilarious to be around but during those stressful months I became so scared to leave the house, like their were people targeting us and if I didn't watch the doors throughout the night someone was going to come in. I woke up 3-6 times a night to check on the doors making sure all the locks were on. 

I had insomnia because I was afraid if I went to sleep I would die. I was so sure I was dying and if I walked too much, drank too much, talked too much I was going to have a heart failure. 
I was extremely dizzy throughout the months so it made it ever more terrifying. I would get up and sometimes fall back down or fall into something.

 I hid this all from EVERYONE. So when my friend asked me to hang out with her, I agreed and had a panic attack thinking I was going to pass out and dit right there. I tried to hold in my cry and hide my shaking hands and walk more straight but slow so she wouldn't notice.

During these months I also felt like sometimes I wasn't in my body.. All noises, even mine was faint and almost echoing like a hallway. People and things like streets were so close yet so FAR. I ground was like walking on waves and the hallways got longer. 

I didn't realize how fast time flew but also felt like it was a year. Before I knew, even I looked different. I gained 20-30 pounds.. I lost my strength, I cannot concentrate and have HORRIBLE memory. I can't talk without freezing. 
I still get racing heart, chest pain, shaking body, lump in my throat, lack or concentration, sadness, night terrors, cold sweats, bad dizziness and vertigo, muscle weakness and trouble sleeping. I'm still recovering but those months were absolutely terrifying and exhausting. I still fear I'm going to die and that something is going to happen to me but its not as bad as it was before. 

Such a weird experience to look back on..
What do you think that was? I can't talk to anyone about because I sound absolutely crazy myself.
Also, I don't know what to do about my friends, things started getting better now and I haven't seen them in months. I don't want it to come back after seeing them again. 

I don't know what to do :(

5,"Ok so recently a guy posted about his hardship with is GF and how she believed he was a time traveler to the point they broke up and are just recently getting back together. I’ve only been diagnosed about a year ago and my last medication made me a zombie and gave me terrible headaches. 

Also I am in between job hoping after my test tomorrow I might land this amazing job. I have no health insurance so right now I’m on no meds bc I can’t afford them. I know no one might read this but I’m really scared right now. I didn’t know delusions were part of this and I’ve been lying to myself and told no one about the shadows and hearing my name daily. I just found out this is common and I’m so scared to be even more crazy. 

Every time something good happens I end up doing something I can’t believe. I have so much to say right now but I don’t think anyone will even read this and no one will want to listen. I’ve got a small immediate family and a good amount of friends but I can’t tell any of them. I just try to make people laugh and try and forget about how I’m so alone and how I just want to love and care for someone. How I wish any of my dreams would come true. And how I wish so bad I didn’t have thoughts like if I just kill myself I won’t have to worry about this test or my failure and the way I’ve hurt people. How I’ll never find a good girl that I’d work so hard for and promise never to hurt her. I don’t want to disappoint myself or others anymore. If anyone reads this thanks. I’m just so scared I can’t say that enough just so very very scared right now. I just want to be normal and take care of my family and friends. I just want to be proud and have some girl be proud of to be with me. Sorry for the length  if anyone in the world even reads this. 
Have a great life everybody. ",25Apr2018,1
6,"Hello fellow reddit users. I have been a user on Reddit for several years and it is a big part of my daily life. I decided to make an anonymous, throwaway account to have the opportunity to anonymously ask you all for some advice in this ongoing very difficult situation and set of circumstances in my life. In order to understand my current situation, I will need to provide some basic background information about myself and I will try to give a brief timeline overview of my life as well. I want to be as concise as possible to avoid wasting anyone's time but there is a lot of detail to this.

To stay some\-what anonymous, I am an early twenties male and I was born in the US in the state of Georgia. I come from what you would deem a typical middle\-class American family. The first 11 years of my life were fine &amp; dandy and I would say I had a pretty fortunate early childhood. During those first 11 years of my life, I lived in a pretty nice middle\-class home with my mom, dad, and two sisters.

When I was 11 years old and in the 5th grade, my parents called my sisters and I upstairs to talk and out of no\-where they announced they would be getting divorced. Right after that conversation my dad packed his belongings and moved about an hour out of town into a friend's house. Following the divorce, things were pretty hard on me and probably even harder for my two younger sisters.

From this point, a couple weeks go by and out of nowhere my next\-door neighbors announce that they too, are filing for divorce. To give you some insight regarding the neighbors, their family was best friends with my family growing up. We built our houses in our old neighborhood around the same time and our families quickly unified. We grilled out with them nearly nightly and did nearly everything with their family. So that all being said, the neighbors announced their divorce and then a couple weeks later out of nowhere the neighbor's dad \(who to this day is technically my ""step dad""\), starts having dinner over at our house. The dinners progressed into him eventually staying over nightly, and then after a few more weeks he was living full\-time with us. Being 11 years old at the time, I really didn't know what to think was going on within my parent's marriage, and then also the neighbors marriage.

Several more weeks go by, and the million\-dollar dream home \(that my parents were in the process of building before they decided a divorce was coming\) finishes construction. My dad ends up deciding to move into the house by himself so at that point I was spending a few nights a week with him. At this point I think I had moved onto middle school and I was basically transitioning back and forth between my dad's new house and the house I grew up in where the neighbor\-dad was now also living. In my original house it was now my mom, my two sisters, and my soon\-to\-be step brother living there. Meanwhile, the neighbor\-wife is still living right next door in their original house! It was all a complete mess.

Fast forward a year \(this was around 2008\) and my mother &amp; the neighbor\-husband have announced they are getting married, and then the very next day they announce my mom is pregnant. At this time, my dad is still living in the dream house and my sisters and I were staying with him a few nights a week. This is the year that things took quite a turn for my dad, as this is when the US economy collapsed and many lost their jobs. My dad lost his one and only job of 32 years where he had a very comfortable salary. Within a matter of months, his dream home was foreclosed and he was out of work. He ended up moving in with his mother for the time\-being while I lived full\-time with my mom &amp; new step dad.

This is where the problems start to arise. I really don't like referring to this man as my ""step dad"" but technically that is his title so that is how I will reference him. My step dad was very egotistical, the king of verbal abuse, and he cares about nothing other than money. My mom and step dad would fight/argue constantly, multiple times a week and it was always in range for my sisters and I to either see or hear. These fights weren't some sissy mess either, we are talking punches being thrown into walls, TVs being broken, an entire closet of clothes and other luxuries being dumped into our backyard swimming pool, and the list goes on and on... Not only was my step dad always verbally abusive or fighting with my mom, but my sisters, my step\-brother, and myself all received similar treatment. An example that will stick with me until the day I die was one night when the entire family was home, my sisters, step brother and I were all upstairs in our home and my step\-dad and mom were downstairs. My siblings and I were all in one room watching a movie when out of nowhere a massive altercation between my mom &amp; step dad breaks out. My siblings and I sat upstairs absolutely terrified while our parents were downstairs going at it. They were throwing various objects at each other, exchanging verbal abuse, and at the point when I heard what I thought was my mom getting pushed into the door I immediately ran downstairs. I did not see it happen, nor will my mom admit that it happened, but I am 99&amp;#37; sure that she was thrown into her bedroom door by my step\-dad as they were fighting. My step\-dad had smashed my mom's iPhone on the bedpost and their bedroom TV was broken. While I was still in their bedroom with my mom after all this had happened, my step\-dad walked back in. I basically walked up to him and told him I better never see anything like this happen again or I will call the police. He responded by grabbing be my collar, telling me I was a ""stupid prick."" and that there was nothing I could do about it. The household was absolutely out of control because of my step dad and mother's behavior and no one was genuinely happy. For the most part, everyone stayed in their bedrooms and did their own thing because everyone was afraid of what could happen at any time.

For the next several years it was basically the same as I described above, a household full of verbal abuse and constant fighting. By the time I got to high school I was able to move in full time with my dad, which was definitely a relief. I was so happy to get out of that hell house and away from my inhumane step dad. Some time during my freshman year of high school, I slowly started noticing something was severely off about my personality, my behavior, and my ability to effectively communicate with other people or objects. I began having an extremely difficult time reading/comprehending anything and school was very tough because that made it difficult to learn. I never wanted to do anything but sit in my room and browse the internet. I hated being around large groups of people or in a setting where I knew I had a lot of eyes on me because I would become over the top anxious and panic. I eventually told my dad what was going on and I saw a psychiatrist for the first time. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with GAD \(or Generalized Anxiety Disorder\), panic disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder. He prescribed me a basic anti\-depressant, which I believe was the SSRI citalopram. I took the meds as prescribed and had no luck at improving my anxiety or depression symptoms, so the psychiatrist moved onto a different medication. I tried medication after medication, but nothing ever proved to work long\-term. There were points where I had short\-term luck with a couple medications \(I.E. Remeron\) but its effectiveness quickly faded. Over the years I have been on over 20 different medication trials within the US pharmaceutical industry, those medications ranging from SSRIs, SNRis, to anti\-psychotics as several psychiatrists have diagnosed me with bipolar disorder type II. My anxiety is so severe that it massively impacts my day\-to\-day life. I dropped out of college after nearly two years because my depression and anxiety took over. Even a simple task like going to a class was an impossible challenge because of my mental state.

Fast forward to 2017, I somehow managed to herniate 2 discs in my spinal cord. The doctors were never able to pinpoint what caused it or why, but I personally think it is from moving too much heavy furniture \(helping my parents move houses several times\) while already originally having a weaker spine genetically. With the 2 discs being herniated, it put a complete halt on my life. I was in extreme pain, like I had never felt before, and it was constant no matter what I was doing. I had horrible sciatica pain and could hardly sleep because my back was hurting so badly. After 6 months of visits with multiple orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons, I finally found a neurosurgeon who offered a solution. That solution was a 3\-level spinal fusion surgery that he told me would alleviate up to 70&amp;#37; of my pain. As I had been laying in bed for months unable to do anything from the severe pain caused by the herniated discs, I decided to move forward with the procedure and in the summer of 2017 I had the 3\-level spinal fusion performed. Recovery was one of the most challenging things I have ever been through, but I would say overall the surgery has alleviated about 50&amp;#37; of my pain. That is A LOT, but I still do have a ton of daily pain. I will also need to have future operations of the same nature done about once a decade to keep the fusion operating correctly.

From July 2017 to January 2018 I basically spent all my time recovering from this huge operation. I really couldn't walk much for the first month and it has been a slow moving recovery to say the least. So just at the New Year, I decided it was time to get my life back on track and get back to work full\-time. I ended up getting a pretty well\-paying job in retail sales and I had incredible benefits. Two weeks ago, I had a massive panic attack while at work and basically walked out the door. I did not just abruptly decide to quit, this decision was made after dealing with horrible anxiety and panic attacks for the last 3 months while on the job. My anxiety has the ability to easily take over my entire mind and it often causes me to lose my train of thought or entirely forget what I was saying. This often happened during transactions with customers and I would become so embarrassed and end up panicking even more. I often spent my 30\-minute lunch break crying in my car because my anxiety was so bad and I just wanted to leave. And eventually I did...

If you are still reading, I just want to thank you so much for your time. I know this has been a long post but I have no idea what to do at this point in my life.

So that brings me to where I am now, unemployed with a few thousand in debt, a few thousand in the bank and an absolutely out of control mental illness that I am very worried will one day take my life. So my question to you all is, if you were me where would you go from here? Keep in mind my back is very weak and in tons of pain so the type of work I am able to do has to be taken into consideration, and my anxiety is so severe that I really can't handle face\-to\-face interactions right now. Any advice, tips, or comments are greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Much love to all...",25Apr2018,2

8,"For the past several months, maybe the past year, I've gone through countless ""phases."" For a weeks, I will be extremely sad, finding myself crying frequently, often for seemingly no reason - I'll just find myself locked within this whirlpool of emotions, mainly just sadness. I can't tell if it's warranted due to circumstances within my life or if it's something else and for a while I've classified it as depression.

Though it feels like depression, as I've said earlier, it comes in ""phases,"" for lack of a better word. In between said ""phases,"" I find myself able to enjoy things, have fun, laugh with my friends, and generally enjoy everything around me, regardless of what happens. When the storm comes, so to speak, I can't find motivation to do anything, I'm constantly on the verge of crying, and very few things bring me enjoyment.

I'm 17 years old, so it's a given that I live with my parents. I've tried talking to my mom about it and I can't tell if she's dismissing it as something normal or that she just doesn't know what to do. My father is another story, I have the impression that he couldn't give less of a shit about my mental state due to a variety of reasons. I haven't seen a therapist and I want to leave that as a last resort due to my family's financial situation. 

If someone could help me identify my problem, I would be able to make steps toward fixing it, or at least alleviate it. Any help would be appreciated :)",25Apr2018,2
9,"We live during an amazing time where universities are studying psychoactive drugs including psilocybin and their effects on humans using the rigorous standards of scientific method and research necessary to prove the efficacy of treatments. I had the opportunity to be accepted into this particular study.


 I feel like I need a little backstory about my condition before jumping into how beneficial this has been for me, so here goes. I found the study after being exasperated with the limited and unsatisfactory experiences I’ve had over the years with the current mental health system in the USA. I’ve suffered with Major Depression since around middle school, and finally sought treatment at the age of 28 when I felt I could no longer continue living out my day to day life. I wasn’t going to kill myself, but I didn’t want to live anymore either.


 I didn’t care anymore about if I woke up the next day, ate my next meal, or took my last breath. It didn't seem worth it. I sought traditional talk therapy weekly to start. I found after a year that I didn't notice improvement, and still just continued to live another day because I existed. I pushed through work, it was the only thing that kept me going. I tried different therapists and therapeutic methods. I went on Wellbutrin for a year, and felt that I no longer had any feelings. I was convinced that I barely existed at this point, and it was possible that I would never feel anything ever again. Nothing made me happy, nothing changed my moods. Wellbutrin may work for some people, but did not work for me. 


I went to different doctors and got many tests done to rule out possible underlying illness like full thyroid panels, nutritional deficiencies, and anything else that may show up in different blood panels. They never found anything and told me I was in perfect physical health. 


I tried self-help books and watched many TED talks about positive thinking and improving your perceptions. I took an online class on positive thinking. I quoted all the things I was learning to people I knew, convincing them I’ve found happiness because you can choose to be happy. None of this made any real sense to me deep down. None of these things hit home or caused any sort of a real breakthrough. I was a parrot, reciting lines I thought would help me feel better about living every second of every day. I first needed to address the fact that I have emotions no matter how deeply they are buried before I could understand anything like “happiness comes from within”, and I didn’t have that kind of understanding or realization about myself before the study. These books I read, talks I watched, podcasts I listened to, and classes I had taken did help me come to the realizations I did during the study. Even though they didn’t work at the time, they did eventually make sense and helped connect things for me. 



I only continued to get worse, and one day I tried to commit myself to a mental hospital. I was so fed up with having to wake up every morning to take a shower, brush my teeth, go to work, and eat and I didn’t think I could do it anymore. I didn’t want to kill myself, but I didn’t want to exist either. I went to the hospital and talked about my situation. They told me that I would have to tell my employers everything, let them know I needed 2 weeks off immediately, and that it would be very expensive and wasn’t covered by my insurance so I would be in a lot of debt. They made an appointment for the next day for me to see a psychiatrist to start another medication. I talked to her about my situation and she told me that I needed to start Zoloft right now. She let me know that the next availability for me to see any therapists was 2 weeks out, and she wanted me to start a medication I had never used before because she thought I was headed down a “dangerous path” in her words. I was so upset about all of this, and felt like the system was failing me. I wanted a second opinion and found an out of network therapist who helped guide me in the right direction, and assured me that the idea of starting the study was a good one to seek. She couldn’t have been more accurate. 


I had been searching for alternatives for about a year, and through a Nurse Practitioner who directed me to clinicaltrails.gov. A website that lists the studies that are being conducted for many conditions. I searched for depression, and found one that caught my eye for treatment resistant depression using psilocybin. I felt like I fit the description, and wanted to try. 


There were 2 psilocybin sessions, 2 weeks apart with an intensive screening process beforehand. For the sessions they have you lay on a couch in a comfortable room listening to world music with eye shades on and they prep you very well for months leading up to the sessions with 2 guides you've gotten to know over a few months that you can trust. For compensation I had 2 MRI's which I received $100 each for and received parking validation for campus parking. The real compensation for me however was being able to dive deeper within and explore my consciousness. 


The first session was a lower dose, and lasted about 6 hours. I didn't have any visual hallucinations, but as the music was playing I could feel my thoughts jumping from one idea to another and making connections that hadn't previously been made. It was as if the usual walls up in my brain had dissolved and caused a collaboration of thoughts that proved to be beneficial for me. I simultaneously wanted to learn everything and know everything all at the same time. It reignited a curiosity for me to learn. I also felt very connected to humanity. 

The second session was a higher dose, and a little different. It also lasted about 6 hours. With this dose I did have visual hallucinations. I could see and feel paint dripping on a blank canvas. I saw myself drifting as if in slow motion, sometimes stopping completely. This was all orchestrated to the music I was listening to. It seemed absurd, but the experience did bring together some things about myself that I didn't recognize until this. 


 Without the expertise, direction, science, dedication, and care the research team put into this, I wouldn’t have been able to have the kind of breakthrough I had with this study. I realized my potential, and I saw through my depression for the first time. I could identify walls I had built up, and was able to make connections that I hadn’t made before. I realized that I was keeping myself from feeling emotions because it was more comfortable than feeling them. I was blocking people out because I was worried I wasn’t smart enough and I would be judged because of it. I was worried people were judging me for every word that came out of my mouth. I had been living my life wondering if I was doing the right things, or making the right decisions that I had stunned myself into inaction. I felt like I couldn’t move anywhere because of fear of judgement, making the wrong choice, and being a complete waste of oxygen in general. I mean, what really can I offer? The answer for me? Connection. Just making one connection with another human is worth living for. We can build greatly on that. Without this human connection we have, civilization would never had gotten to where it is today. We can collaborate, build, teach, learn, and so much more. How amazing is it that we’re all here, right now, living on the same planet at the same time? This is truly something that should be appreciated. The more time I was focusing on the things I felt I couldn’t accomplish, the more I was missing out on living life and realizing how amazing it can be. 


I will say that this specific treatment is not for everyone, and could potentially be harmful to some people, but the screening and care they put into these sessions helps them gauge if a treatment will be potentially successful or not. It’s important to put that into perspective. There are so many other studies they are working on with other psychoactive substances and treatments, there are studies that may help many other conditions. The only way to know and find out for yourself if you are suffering or curious is to check clinicaltrails.gov, check your area, and see if there is anything close by or worthwhile for you to consider. There is also maps.org, or you can go directly to university websites to check and see what studies they are currently doing.


 The research team for this study helped save my life, and I was extremely lucky to have had my experience. It was one of the most amazing, meaningful experiences I've had. Make sure you read up on any study before jumping in, you should never have to pay to be in a study. They brief you on everything, so it’s possible that halfway through you’ll decide it doesn’t seem like the right time, and that’s OK too. I had my doubts, but I’m so happy I didn’t quit. I was so fed up with the direction my life was going that I needed to try something different, and if anything, it would’ve been an interesting thing to have experienced even if I came out no different or worse. I didn’t feel like I had much to lose from what I had already experienced in my life. I was scared and I was also hopeful for the future. I have my life, and am extremely grateful to be here with everyone else now, and that is because of the study I was in. 


Not every study is going to work for everyone. Being honest with yourself and with the research team is invaluable as it will help them and you gauge if this is going to be a good fit for you. There is nothing to benefit from lying to yourself and to the research team. Positive things may happen, but they may not. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but in my experience with the psilocybin study, a breakthrough has happened that hadn’t happened before which I was excited to share. My experience was specific to me, and I hope that if you have a mental health condition or any condition you will educate yourself and seek help to improve your overall quality of life.

Here’s my story: 

I was sentenced to a few years in prison. About halfway through I was given the option to be released early If I successfully completed a “treatment program” this was where I’d be molested everyday for a few months. I didn’t know this at the time or obviously I would never have gone.


I was sent to a different prison, where the rules are strict. But......not to hard to follow. Basic stuff.

Examples of rules: 

#1 have to make bed 

#2 have to tuck shirt in

#3 have to go do an exercise program early in the morning

#4 attend classes 

#5 don’t smoke inside 

......basic stuff.



Here’s the catch.


You have to tell on each other for breaking rules, or you fail the program. 


They want to turn ex-cons into snitches. Which of course, is idiotic. 


Oh, and........the counselors automatically just believed whatever they were told. Which is why my life became hell.





My bunkie in prison took my want of leaving prison and molested me each night I was there. Saying that if I didn’t go along with it, he would have me kicked out of the program like he did to others, all he had to do was tell them a lie like I smoked indoors and back to prison I go. 

I wanted to leave desperately, so I went along with it. I wanted to see my family and I was only in there for fucking pot anyways. I wasn’t much of a hardcore criminal, and prison in general was not for me. 


Anyways, I’m just particularly upset about it right now. Thanks for letting me vent

11,"I (F/20) am currently in a very healthy and amazing four-and-a-half month long relationship with a guy (M/21) that I really, really admire. He is graduating from college next month and I am currently a sophomore at the same university. Lately, I have been overwhelmed by the workload at both my university and my internship, along with the prospect of doing long distance as I am going abroad in the fall. I have been venting to him about my mental health problems, but I can always tell that he feels guilty for not solving my depression/anxiety (which he knows is impossible to do in the first place). I always find myself saying sorry to him, and trying to move on as if nothing happened. I guess I'm just scared of him thinking that I am ""too much"", or I have a lot of emotional baggage (the thought of having too much emotional baggage also causes me  a lot of anxiety). I guess my question is: how do I make sure he feels like he is helping me and my mental state? I have never been happier in my life, and I want him to know that (even though it doesn't seem like it). 

TL;DR scared of losing loving and healthy relationship due to my own perceived idea that I have ""too much emotional baggage"", need to reduce anxiety around how my mental health is perceived by my amazing boyfriend ",25Apr2018,1

Lately I have been researching and looking into the Impostor Syndrome, and I was looking into finding anecdotes, stories or even just opinions on it. To summarize the syndrome itself, it is the inability to internalize one's achievements and the anxiety of being found out as a fraud undeserving of being in the position you are at. Though it can affect anyone, it seems to be more prevalent with high achievers in often marginalized communities.

If anyone is interested, I would love to hear your stories. I do plan to use them as part of an art project, so please note that I might read them out-loud. Each story would also remain completely anonymous, and I would refrain from giving any information on the participants. This project will not be made for profit either, but for an academic setting attended by other students. 

Feel free to reach out and DM me, or just comment here. I will do my best to answer any questions, or even just discuss, since this is a subject that I have been pondering for a while.

tl:dr Have thoughts or anecdotes on the Impostor Syndrome and wouldn't mind sharing them with me? DM me or comment here please! ",25Apr2018,3
13,"Being raised with so much access to media, games, books, etc, and overindulging in escapism I think has been detrimental to me. Lately I'm so unhappy with my self, my life, etc, I'm occasionally hit with how it feels like I could easily just slip into some other reality. Like I get an instinctive response to ""reach for the remote to change the channel"" per say, only to start being gripped by the realization that reality is the one thing I can't do that with.

I feel like I put off addressing my self, causing me to only get worse, making me suppress self-awareness even further only to make the problem worse in a loop. I might have finally bottomed out. Now I'm starting to realize far too much stuff I should have realized years ago, and all of it at once is very uncomfortable in a very intimately existential sense.

Long and short of this: I really, really want out. Very badly. I'm remembering that quote about suicide, comparing the choice of burning to death or jumping from a burning building. I feel like my metaphorical building is burning out of control.",25Apr2018,3
14,"I'm unable to see a doctor so I hope reddit can help me. No known history of illnesses in my family. Late 20s.

Over the past year I've slowly become increasingly angry and paranoid. I don't understand what's happening to me. It's terrifying.

The smallest thing will happen and I become filled with uncontrollable rage and intrusive thoughts. If it was a person that caused it I can't stop thinking of terrible things. For weeks. I've begun acting on some of the less severe thoughts but they're still horrible acts. I want to stop. I can't stop dwelling and being hateful towards strangers

I'm extremely paranoid. I feel people are always out to get me. Watching me. People walking behind me makes me extremely nervous and angry. I avoid speaking with people or speaking loudly so others can't overhear because I'm worried they'll use something against me. 

I'm becoming increasingly narcissistic... I noticed recently when people do the smallest things not only will I get furious but I get these thoughts as if I'm so much better than them, and how dare they cross me, how they should know who I am... and it's complete bullshit, I'm just a regular person and always have been, but suddenly these thoughts are so strong and it feeds the other problems I have

I can't bear to live like this. I'm miserable, angry, and paranoid. And utterly terrified at the same time as this slowly gets worse. Please please please help me. I want a normal life again normal relationships. I don't know what to do. I feel like my real self is being buried by some malicious version that wants to exploit or hurt everyone

16,"I'm a 21 year old student from the USA. 

I struggle deeply with self esteem issues, so deeply that I didn't even realize until I read up on it and it just resonated with me. I think being raised by a narcissistic dad has a lot to do with it. Once he realized I was becoming a rational human at the age of 10, he used every weapon he could to bring me down to the point where I thought I was the crazy one that was overreacting.
Now, I struggle to take my own feelings seriously and I don't want to annoy my therapist. 
I saw a psychiatrist but felt a huge condescending tone because he would say things like, ""well you're just resilient ! That's good."" or ""I mean you just said you know you're not ugly""
I dumped him quick and I'm going to see a new therapist soon. It was a slap in the face to me because I told personal things to this psychiatrist and embarrassed myself and he just shut me down.

Rationally speaking, if I compare my face and body to other women, I can see how I am deemed ""beautiful"" in a physical sense. Like I know I have a small jaw, nice cheekbones, tiny nose, lifted brows, pouty lips, natural tan skin, blonde hair, and facial symmetry, but I struggle so much with self confidence.

I put a lot of time and money into makeup and put my best face forward, trying to look refreshed and polished rather than tacky and heavy. But I still can't feel fully confident. If I wear makeup, I'm content. If I don't, I just don't really want to be seen. I walk around just trying to get through the day most of the time, even taking Uber to class because I don't want to be looked at. 
I limo tint the windows of my car so nobody can see me while I'm driving. 

Even on an anonymous reddit post, I feel kind of weird and guilty stating these things. I'm in a constant state of wanting validation for my looks but instantly withdrawing and getting creeped out when I get attention for it. I used to get hit on a lot when I was heavier and looked more ""approachable"", but I lost weight now and started taking better care of my looks and now nobody really talks to me. Nobody validates my looks because I feel like girls just assume I know so they stopped complimenting me and guys just think negative things of me and don't want to risk anything. I want to be appreciated for my looks but I also cringe at the thought of it. I'm appalled by my body most of the time. I feel like I'm too skinny and then I suddenly feel too fat even though (thinking rationally) I'm a US size 4. 

I get terribly sweaty and awkward when people look at me, but if people don't look at me, I just wonder what I'm doing wrong and feel like a failure. I'm slipping academically and my relationships are failing because of the stress from childhood and I feel like I might've put more effort into my looks as a last ditch effort to redeem my identity. 

I sell myself to crappy men because I don't know my self worth- at least that's what my friends say.

All of my ex boyfriends just use me for sex and say things like, ""can we just talk after we have sex? I can't look at you and just not want sex""

And I would feel hurt not because of the forced sex, but because I just wanted that man to like me. When he forces sex on me or pushes me around or ignores me, I just assume it's because I'm hideous to look at, or my butt is too flat, or my face looks hideous from the side. 

I know this is a problem but how am I even supposed to feel comfortable telling people these things when guys are literally afraid to even hit on me because they think I won't be interested?

19,"It’s my birthday tomorrow! I love birthdays and usually do a big celebration but this year I will be spending it alone. I have great friends and family but the boyfriend and I just broke up so I’m laying low for the time being. Friends have offered to take me out but not feeling up to be around a large crowd.

Also I decided to go to therapy and also try medication. As another year older, I’m hoping to get another year wiser. I haven’t been okay for a long time and I think it’s overdue in getting help. I struggle with depression and anxiety. Some days are better than others. Like right now, I feel okay but two days ago I was not. I think I sound pretty cheerful right now but I think it’s because I’m finally getting help - there’s light at the end of the tunnel and it’s not a train. 

In the past I’ve lost a few loved ones, people I truly care about, even a few jobs from depression/anxiety. It’s time I do something about this. I’m too young to be this sad or to be this sad in general.

Every year I wish to be happy when I blow out my candles and I think this year instead of wishing I’m gonna go do something about it. Wish me luck (and a happy birthday please) everyone!

21,"I recently switched from sertraline to escitalopram. Sertraline was somewhat working for me, but I had developed restless walking from some of my medications, possibly the neuroleptic ziprasidone. During the switch to escitalopram, I noticed a very pleasant, calming, anti-depressive feeling. I feel like I could benefit from the combination of both, but I'm concerned of serotonin syndrome or other issues.

The only literature I currently found was a study saying you shouldn't combine anti-depressants of the same class in treatment-resistant depression.

Have you ever successfully combined two SSRIs? Did it work out in the long-term?

30,"My sister is almost 18 and yet regularly cuts herself. She cuts her thighs and arms in cuts that aren’t lethal. 

My poor mum has been taking her to different psychologists for about a year now and not one single psychiatrist has diagnosed her with depression or anxiety. They just give her anti depressants and hope they’ll help.

When we ask why she does it she says she doesn’t know. I literally am starting to think she does it for fun. We have tried and tried to get her to admit why she does it but how can we help if she doesn’t say anything at all? 

It’s extremely frustrating. She goes out with friends and goes to parties and has fun and then all of a sudden she will say she has a “depression day”. But people with depression don’t pick and choose when they get depressed...and she doesn’t have bipolar been tested for that too. 

So, I am starting to think she does this for attention. She’s the middle child and she always complains that our younger brother gets all the attention. So maybe for her, bad attention is good enough as long as it’s attention?

Do people grow out of this phase? If it’s attention seeking, how do I stop it? And if it’s not, how do I help? Nothing else works 

EDIT: she doesn’t try to hide the cuts. she wears bloodied bandaids and short sleeves/shorts.

31,"Do you ever find when your beginning to make healthier changes in your life when you aren't exactly depressed but  been under strain for a longtime , that one day  going about your day not  sure what way your minds at don't feel good don't feel bad , all of a sudden , something triggers a negative spiral ,you  get an overwhelming feeling of depression that you can't get away from but after awhile subsides it may only last half an hour. But from previous experience this can end up   in a week  long or more depressive state , either it's because when you begin to see the light you have some sort of  realisation that you've had a form of dysthymia /depression on and off for close to a decade but that you are far from out of the woods or maintaining long-term goals

32,"Hello Reddit. I am 31 years old and recently have lost my job, my income, and live with my parents. About 2 months ago I fell into a deep depression and I'm not even sure where or why. I haven't left the house in 2 months, I haven't showered in 2 months, I haven't left my room in 2 months. In the past couple of weeks I've attempted to kill myself by dehydration. i figured if I could make it 6 days without drinking ANYTHING, then I'll succeed. Sadly after about 4 days in of not eating or drinking anything, I'll sneak out in the late night and drink gallons of water (Guess my body wanted it that bad).


Anyways, my parents have communicated with me through Facebook and have basically said if I don't get help, I'm no longer welcome there. Stubborn me just figured ""fine, I'll be homeless for the first time in my life, maybe I can successfully die out on the streets instead"". But then something happened tonight while sitting here, still in my room. It's like a glistening of hope, wow hope, haven't felt or heard that in a while, anyways it's like an angel of hope or something came over me and said ""Just get help, you'll feel great"". I'm naturally a very outgoing, funny, and happy person, so it's not right that I've gotten this deep into whatever depression this is to the point I've contemplated killing myself, suicide by cop, all sorts of crazy things.

34,"Hi all. most of my life i am very shy and anxious when it comes to talking to people and socializing,of course this never has helped me in my life mostly on high school i was sitting alone in the class,had no friends,not a chance to have a girlfriend and i was very anxious most of the time.

But on the first day on high school i had a massive boost of confidence,it felt like the shyness and anxiety had gone i was very social and even got a chance to make some friends and have a chance of getting a girlfriend.During this time i was feeling great but this only lasted 6-7 hours then i was back to shyness and anxiety.

I had a few more confidence boosts that was random and haven't notice anything that may trigger them and the duration of those boosts was also kind of random(e.g 10 minutes, 6-7 hours, 1 months...)

So my questions are: 

1) does this boosts of confidence have a name?

2) is there anyway to get back in this mood full of confidence at will?

For as long as i can remember,being concentrated to something has been a hard process for me.

And after some time i wanted to do it again. And i did it. And i gave up again. I was and am still loosing interest easily in many things of life and then get interested again in the same things.

What can I do?",25Apr2018,1
46,"Based on the changes in my behavior and attitude over the years, I can't tell if it's the result of long-term underlying depression or something else.

Briefly put, I'm more desensitized to social interactions and excitement than most people. And from what I've found, this seems to be classified as Anhedonia. However, I've also become very indifferent to violent or passive situations. For example, I've watched very violent videos on other sites (out of curiosity), and while my peers are unsettled by what happens, I'm not phased in the least bit. Likewise, I've gone to parties and other social events, and felt like I was amidst a group of chaotic monkeys. In both situations, I felt like more of a cold-observer than a feeling person. 

This wasn't always the case though. While I've always been introverted and not one to talk much, I've never been so devoid of life. I often read that depression leads to not appreciating oneself, or feeling worthless. But I don't feel that way about myself, only about everything around me. I feel like no matter what path I choose to take, life is monotonous and exceptionally boring with a predictable ending for everyone. Sure there's been times where I've had a genuine smile for a day, but I always have that underlying feeling that there's not much point to anything in the broad scheme of things. And by the next day, I'm right back to this sense that I'm just droning among 7 billion other souls on a very isolated planet.

Consequently, I've felt a strong sense of detachment from morality in general. I appeal to law and order because it's more logical than to break law and create disorder. But I feel that if I did go against the norm, I wouldn't feel any different as I do now. So in about every aspect, I am desensitized to many aspects of living, but I don't feel worthless. I still feel emotions, but it lasts very short periods of time before I'm back to my bland state. 

So I'm not entirely sure if this is depression, or something completely different? I doubt I am the only individual to have this general mindset.",25Apr2018,1
47,"WARNING IT'S LONG BUT I NEED SOMETHING LOL. 

Okay so past post are pointless at this point because it's likely that I was way over dramatic and played the victim... I was a victim but I was a perpetrator too. So I'm 28/f/ok and I'm going to refer to my ex as complicated boyfriend (I will explain more later)... my ex is 33/m/tx.. 

Today is our 3 yr anniversary but due to a bad manic episode I left him 3 months ago. Our relationship at first was amazing a good manic high and nothing could bring me down. Little to no sleep, energy for days, completely obsessed with my positive in my life... around our 1 yr anniversary I brought up getting married and he was against getting remarried... it sent me into a depression and it took everything to get the kids out of bed and up for school... I chalked it up to being tired of being a stay at home mom of 4 kids.. I wanted a change so I cleaned the house and rearranged the bedroom and felt good for days... then I became extremely irritable and started feeling worthless and like I had no part in the relationship and I listened to outsiders, so the day trump won the election I told complicated boyfriend that if he didn't talk to me I was leaving and he said ""I'm making lunch"" so I called my mom... who talked me into coming back to Oklahoma so I started packing my stuff... I ended up unpacking my stuff and staying... I came back home for Christmas that year though... I also tried jumping out of a moving vehicle because I felt so worthless and unhappy... January of 2017 I went back to texas and got into counseling in February that year.. I went to counseling for 3 months and she was a quack, she just made things worse and the fights got worse. So in late May I quit her and was fine but of course my 2 children were away for summer break and his kids were away for summer break so besides each other there were no stressors... June we got into a fight and I called my best friend to come get me and ended up talking him into letting me come home a few days later. That summer was great, I fell in love all over again. Kids came home and everything was great for a few months. We were house shopping still and really planning a future together. October came and idk what we were fighting about but it sent me into a panic which ended up with a concussion and the dr put me on brain rest for a week... wonderful I couldn't do anything for a week. The day after I fell I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol because I misread the bottle which was totally unlike me and I was coming up with wild ideas of driving just to get lost because my best friend and I had GPS on our phones... she told me no because I was on brain rest and I pouted like a 2 yr old. After that, I contemplated swallowing the whole bottle of tylenol pm because I was convinced I wasnt loved, that everyone was better off without me... I never touched the pill bottle. I called a psychiatrist instead... see 5 yrs ago I was diagnosed with MDD, PTSD and GAD so I just thought my highs and lows were due to depression... never thought I was manic.. that was in October. So in November when i met with my psychiatrist, i sighed and said i have major depressive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder but that my mom is an undiagnosed borederline so I have BPD traits and i think i might be bipolar. She put me on 35.7mg effexor, 50mg seroquel for sleeping and 0.5mg ativan PRN for anxiety... the effexor didn't make the depression stop. I'd take it in the mornings and was super tired.. she said it was like wellbutrin and would give me the bump of energy, it didn't... she kept upping my seroquel though for sleeping she'd say... I wanted to kill myself from November to January. All while I'm already feeling like that my complicated boyfriend is telling me that I'm a lazy ass and I'm the main cause for his stress because I wasnt working... I wasnt even trying to work. I put in an app here and there but I wasnt actively trying to work outside the home and beyond pick up the house here and there i wasnt really cleaning either but felt I was doing so much and I was overwhelmed. January came and we got in an argument and I told him that he was failing our relationship just like he failed his marriage. He comes back with ""at least someone wanted to marry me."" It shattered me, I'm still hung up on it. I went to see my psychiatrist a few days later and I told her my effexor dose needed to be increased and what had taken place between december's visit and january's visit... December we went to his dad's for Christmas and we were kid free.. smiling and acting normal while depressed is incredibly hard.. new years eve my anxiety was screwing with me and he told me I was getting chunky.. here nor there, my meds did make me gain weight but I'm still in normal range. Well when I told my psychiatrist that my effexor needed to be increased she told me that my depression symptoms wouldn't go away until I left my abusive relationship.. I sat on that.. I wanted to feel better but I truly did love what I had... the house a good man and 4 beautiful children.. it was what I always wanted. I found a man who'd push me when I needed it who always had my back but sometimes he hurt my feelings with his words... it was January 16th, my grandmother called and told me that my grandfather who had Alzheimer's had had a stroke that morning.. so I was nippy and in an even worse mood than I had been in for months.. my complicated boyfriend and I got into an argument that night sitting on the bed and he told me I was crazy just like my mother so I started slapping his head and I didn't stop until he threw me off the bed. Then it was omg you just threw me off the bed and I completely dismissed that I was uncontrollably slapping him. January 23rd, his stress got to him and I was the theoretical punching bad through text messages.. telling me I was a lazy ass and the main cause of his stress... I begged him to stop talking like that telling him that I was going to leave the relationship if he didn't stop... I was thinking he'd stop but he told me to leave then. So backed into a corner, I called my mom and my sister and they came and got me that night. 

So here we are April 25th, 3 months and 2 days later... I have hit amazing highs and suicidal thought lows more rapidly than ever before. About a month ago I talked to my dad who's been a psych nurse for the last 14 yrs.. I told him that I thought I was bipolar and explained why I thought that... I hadn't read up on bipolar to self diagnose myself I just knew that you cycle when you're bipolar and your highs are wonderful... my highs are wonderful, I become the baddest bitch ever... bipolar lows, I think about killing myself because I'm a burden on everyone... felt this way for years... I WANT OFF THE ROLLERCOASTER RIDE! 

Yesterday April 24th, I received a diagnosis that didn't surprise me but was unexpected. I am bipolar, color me shocked.. but my PTSD comes from my childhood, mainly my mom. Not the F5 tornado I was in on May 3, 1999... that was unexpected. I can't stand my mom, her breathing irritates me and I dont know why. It is what it is I guess... 

Okay so complicated boyfriend who's technically an ex... we have not gone a day without talking since I left... I try not to talk to him when I have those days that I don't want to talk to anyone but he insists that I talk to him.. I'll block his number but he emails me and we communicate that way. It does good because I've noticed that when I cut communication from people I end up lashing out at someone a few days later... so he still helps me. We have agreed not to date anyone or talk to other people and not have sex with anyone. He came to see my last month and it was incredible. We are recognizing that today is our 3 yr anniversary... looking at reality he's my complicated boyfriend or maybe that's what I'm telling myself.. hell if I know. I feel like my uncontrollable mood swings ruined my relationship. 

Yesterday I felt on top of the world. Could careless that i was diagnosed with BP because i was BP before the diagnosis.. I was happy that I had an answer so I could get help finding a solution and live a normal life off this rollercoaster ride... that's my hopes anyways. I text complicated boyfriend apologizing for slapping him until he threw me off the bed and that during my intake I referred to him as my complicated boyfriend. I want him to feel special... I even ordered him a keychain that has a compass on it and says not all those who wander are lost... the summer of 2016 we had picked out commitment tattoos and the one I picked out for him was a compass that said not all those who wander are lost. Well he ended up telling me that he wasnt my complicated boyfriend and it was something I was just calling him because I left him and I made him not my boyfriend... telling him to look at reality didn't do anything besides make me stop talking to me. 

This morning I text him and told him happy anniversary and to have a great day, he said you too. I asked him to call me during his lunch because I wanted to here his voice and he said he had a meeting during his lunch. I asked him to call me when he got off work and he said we'll see... I am afraid that he's limiting communication. Fair enough I do it too right? He said last night ""I am worried that if I let us get back together before you are able to address your mental issues that I will lose myself in the process of being there for you. I have dedicated myself for the last three years to being your rock and trying to help you grow. I did it even when it hurt me and my health without ever thinking"" I told him that I wasnt going to ask to come home until I could promise to keep the home happy and that I felt like he was ending things completely. He responded with ""I'm not trying to completely end things but I have to look out for me because nobody else is going to."" 

I feel like it's completely done, that he's completely done... he'd never said anything like that before. Idk what to think... I know getting mentally healthy is important to me because nobody should have to fight the bipolar demons... I'm at a loss and I feel like if I tell him how I feel about all of this he'll tell me I'm trying to guilt him or that hes not doing the pity party... 

I am so tired of being called dramatic or told that I'm throwing myself a pity party. I'm tired of ignorant people who think bipolar disorder goes away.. it doesn't go away, its controlled but I'll take medication for the rest of my life unless I want to cycle... my current state is depression.. that's why they said. I didn't feel depressed until last night and I'm not so uppity today but I'm not having thoughts of being worthless... my heart is just heavy. 

I'm sorry this is so long and all over the place. I'm just writing how I'm thinking. Thanks for reading and I hope you reply. ",25Apr2018,1
49,"I've been mentally ill since the age of 18. Later diagnosed with bipolar schizoaffective disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and temporal lobe epilepsy, my illness has essentially taken over my life. Add the stress of school, major familial issues, moving out not knowing how to live on my own (cultural issues at play there), I never really had a chance to discover myself or solve any of my personality problems.

I'm now 27 at a point where I'm 90% functional, with few mood swings, much less hallucinations and infrequent seizures thanks to a ton of medication. I'm starting to get a chance to think about myself and I'm realizing how messed up I am.

I don't know how to deal with stress. My social skills are a mess. People my age seem way more mature than I am. More wise and knowledgeable about life in general. I have some interpersonal issues with the way I view myself, in some ways, insecure.

I'm not sure where to start in 'fixing' myself. My psychiatrist dealt with my symptoms but he's not really therapist, it's out of his grasp. Should I see a therapist? While psychiatrists are covered by the government in Ontario, psychologists and therapists are not, and I can’t really afford them. I feel like I have so much to learn and I'm completely out of the loop and in touch with what I should be now.

51,"Hey you guys. I think I’ve been struggling for quite some time. I’m not really sure. When i was younger I had a suicidal period, but it always felt fake to me. I felt that I wasn’t really suicidal, just unhappy that the world was not what I wanted it to be. This was related to an unknown case of mono where I would sleep all day and not eat. I felt dirty that I didn’t use my full potential because of my laziness, which was true to an exent. I still feel that way(lazy), but I’m not suicidal in the same way anymore. Now I’m just confused in general, plagued by overthinking but also not really thinking(???). I’m not unhappy, but I’m almost never content. My feelings seem superficial to me, and I cant trust my own emotions. When i hang out with people i feel disconnected from most of them, and Even though i have some really good friends I always feel like I cant make a connection to them like it seems that other people do. Even though i could probably force myself to do things I have trouble with actually doing them, and i end up just skipping school or flaking on plans. I dont know If Thats just my laziness or If it’s an actual mental problem I’m having. My mood can go from extremely «happy» to apathetic/empty/depressed or whatever like four times a day. Now, I have got a will to live, but I’m unable to make myself do anything except just existing(and doing it badly). I’m smart, I’ve got potential, I’m fairly good looking and from a good family, so I’ve got no reason to be this way. I was raised to be kind, compassionate, content, active and all those things I’m not. I’m also socially competent, i’m aware that people like to be around me Even though they think Im loud and depressive. I know everything exists, but most of the time the majority of things seem like concepts to me. It’s like I’m everything and nothing all at once. Like an impartial watcher that has realized that the world is so abstract that it’s impossible to know or feel anything with certainty. Thats Why i generally disregard my own emotions. What really trips me out is that I feel like everybody is nothing and everything at once. Thats just human nature to me. I thought everybody felt this way, and I strongly believe that this is the burden of the human insignificance and inability to know ourselves completely. But it seems that’s not the case, or people don’t feel comfortable talking about it. Okay I’m really just rambling but fuck it I’m posting anyways. Please tell me If i’m crazy or just contemplating things i shouldnt.",25Apr2018,1

54,"I'm completely at a loss with this. In the past I've struggled with jealousy over being left out but I've been working on it with myself. I should mention that this is my first boyfriend and that I've never expressed this jealousy to him. Last night when I finished dance I found out my boyfriend had gotten drunk with a friend. I'd had a feeling this would happen when he'd said who he was hanging out with, this friend in particular is a bit wild. So I'd expected it. They didn't do anything too crazy and he sobered up really fast, it was only the two on him and his friends girlfriend so it's not like I was missing a party. I was happy he was having a good time, and texting with him while he was still slightly drunk was fun, but I still had that same gross feeling in my chest when I start to feel left out or jealous. But I don't know WHY. there was literally nothing about the situation that really bothered me. Normally when I get that feeling I can reason with myself because I know where it's coming from but I literally have no idea how to get rid of this because I don't know what's causing it.

55,"I don't know if abuse is the right word here, or if this is the right place to post this as I am a Reddit novice, but I felt like it would get people to at least click. I am a college student who was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bi-polar disorder a few years ago. The bi-polar was diagnosed due to my mood swings, but I am not manic. I have been in a few terrible relationships. In my first relationship, I was verbally and emotionally abused, and he cheated on me. I didn't even realize how it affected me until my current relationship. In my second relationship, I was emotionally abused by a guy who was the human equivalent of a brick wall in terms of emotion. I ended up cheating on him (as a result of the last relationship I was in, I was screwed up to believe that if I cheated first, it wouldn't hurt as bad when he cheated on me), and he cheated on me. In my current relationship, I sent nudes to another guy (for the same stupid reason, but I believe I've finally learned my lesson), but my boyfriend forgave me, and we are about to hit our two and a half year mark. This brings me to my current dilemma. I have found that I miss being emotionally and verbally shat on. I provoke my boyfriend into saying terrible things to me, and I genuinely like how hurt it makes me feel. I realized that I love being the victim, and I try to manipulate my boyfriend into doing things I know will hurt me. Obviously, this is incredibly screwed up, and I'm wondering if any of you out there have experienced something like this and how you overcame it. I hate the way I am and the way I act right now, and I know my relationship is not going to last much longer if I don't find help.

A few weeks ago I opted for scratching skin off the back of my hand as a response to feeling down but today I chose the blade to self harm. 
It’s embarrassing telling someone about this but at the same time, I don’t have anyone to talk to. 
I truly do think I have nothing to offer the world and people would genuinely be better off without me around.

I love her more than anything and she gave us our beautiful baby boy (Dashall), she's been my best friend since I was 14 (now 26) and I could never imagine my life without her. I'm not complaining that she has depression or suffers from anxiety, sometimes bad enough where she can't leave the house. I just want to know if anyone else is in my situation, or if anyone else has some tips? 

With work and a small child, she sometimes has these depression spurts that can last days or even weeks, and I just want to have the most patience for her and also for my son. It's frustrating trying to not get frustrated, because I know it's not her fault.

59,"33M here, finally willing to admit I can’t fix myself.  I’m not sure what’s wrong- if it’s anxiety, depression, a combination of the two, but know I can’t keep feeling like this.  

I’m currently looking through the behavioral health providers my insurance will accept and am not sure who to call.  I see licensed social workers all the way up to psychiatrists.  

I feel like what’s wrong with me may be above a social workers scope (perhaps erroneously), but from what I’ve read online psychiatrists seem more into ‘treating’ issues with meds than talking them out- though I’ll take anything at this point.

What have been your experiences?  Any advice on who’s help I should seek?  This is entirely new to me.  Thanks!

To be honest, I have never been the sharpest tool in shed, but things have gotten worse over last few weeks.

I think it is because I am not present in the moment. I heard depression can hinder your memory and intelligence in general, but what is the exact mechanism? Is it because a depressed person displays dissociative tendencies or brain activity is fucked in general? 
Or is it because depression usually causes insomnia and inattention to nutrition, and those are what cause failing memories?

62,"I'm currently doing a couple of courses at uni that are absolute horseshit. For whatever reason, I just can't seem to study well. I know this sounds pathetic, I've rarely had this problem to this magnitude. I haven't always been studying well, but I've always made an effort in getting good grades. In fact last term I got a near perfect score.

The fact that I'm not doing well is stressing me out. The fact that I'm stressed out makes it really hard for me to focus and actually study. I try to go to school during the days to study, but I always end up talking to friends instead. Because of this, I'm again just losing all focus and can not at all seem to concentrate. I'm just in a really bad place mentally at the moment.

Something that isn't helping is the fact that I'm going through an unanswered love situation. I'm in love with one of my best friends in the course, and she's taken so I can't tell her anything. Talking to her every day is nice, but I'm getting more and more depressed over the whole situation.

I don't know how to handle this. It's a vicious circle. The fact that I'm feeling almost nauseous (I don't really feel this way often right now, it's just a feeling I have at the moment) makes it difficult to concentrate on studies, also does the fact that the course is really hard and really boring. Unrequited affection makes me just unhappy in general, meaning I can't really force myself to get energy to study. It's not all just exams, we have a lot of assignments to do throughout the course and while I'm doing them, I feel like I'm being sloppy.

I've been struggling for some time and just started an outpatient therapy program. The original goal was to avoid just this situation. 

I got into work today, checked my emails, saw yet another high-priority now/now/now project and knew I couldn't do it. I went straight to my car and called my outpatient team and told them it's time to discuss leave. I also contacted someone in HR. 

I'm going to see my outpatient therapist in an hour and I'm hanging out in a Starbucks because I don't want to go home.

71,"TLDR: my friend is a Navy Seal. This week is his last week before he leaves town to go back to live with his family. We took mushrooms and he tried to rape a girl right in front of me and I stepped in and swatted him.

I am still pretty shook up from the experience.
My friend is a Navy Seal, honorably discharged for drug use (he was abusing his girlfriend's aderal script to function at a high level.)

This week is his last week living in the same complex that I live in. He was definitely going through a lot. He is moving back home to live with his family, who I think have been worried about his mental state.

Anyway, last night, I had just arrived back home from a 10 day vacation in the country and I had driven 6 hours back home when I decided to send him a text, knowing that this would be his last week.

He asked me if I was hungry because he was making dinner. I decided to go over with a nice bottle of wine.
He was there with a girl he had just met and they were talking about Shamanism.
The girl presenter herself as a practicing Shaman and she said that she had some mushroom chocolates with her if we were interested. 
My friend, the Navy Seal, jumped at the opportunity to try them and even though I was exhausted I caved and indulged myself.

About 45min into our experience, he started muttering to himself, ""I am the God of War. I can do anything."" 
We were all in meditative positions. I was trying to engage my introspective analysis and do a scan of my body to feel if there was any system operating out of order.
Then suddenly, I opened my eyes and I saw the switch go off.
My friend rushed the female Shaman. Bent her over, pulled down her pants and his and was about to rape her. She exclaimed, ""woh!""
And I got up and slapped him saying ""No!""
Like scolding a dog. 

He then sat and continued muttering to himself. He admitted that he had thoughts of suicide, saying, ""I don't want to kill myself...today...not right now...""
This whole experience freaked me out. We were in his house and he has weapons in his home. Not any guns as far as I could see, but he took out a samurai sword and started rei acting cutting someone's head off, saying again, ""I am the god of war...I can do whatever I want.""

The Shaman left shortly afterwards and thanked me for helping her. 

I think I may have been dealing with two very mentally disrupted individuals. And I think that I might be as well. I've never flipped my switch but I haven't seen anyone flip that way, especially someone who I thought I could ""read"" as a ""good person.""

Anyway, the whole thing has brought up a lot of issues for me about male-female relationships as well as Shamanism in mental health.
