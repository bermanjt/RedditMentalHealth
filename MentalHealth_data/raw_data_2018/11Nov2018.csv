0,"Deep down you just *know* that all these symptoms you experience are fake. That you are choosing to suffer, to let the smallest thing set you off, to be scared to death by a single bee. And you know you would be much better off if you would just stop, but you just can't seem to stop, like you're addicted to being a lazy winy coward.

This ideology is:

- Natural
- Inevitable
- **Completely False**

Here's what I have to say about this:

# Of course you assume you're the worst

Anxiety and depression are extremely common co-morbidities, so even if you don't have them, you likely have at least some of the most common symptoms, including having a poor self-image, and assuming the worst even if there's evidence disproving it. How likely do you think a person with those two symptoms would be to constantly worry that they're a fake? It becomes almost a paradox of a sort: the fact that you constantly worry that you choose to worry is proof that your brain is hardwired to constantly worry.

# ""But what if I really am making it up?""

I'm not a psychologist, so take this with a grain of salt, but remember that the brain will do whatever it takes to protect itself. For example, when we fall off a skateboard our natural instinct is to stretch out our arms so as to sacrifice them in the name of our head. As it turns out, rolling into your shoulders is much safer, including for the head, but it puts our head closer to the danger of the ground.

I feel it would be safe to assume that the same applies to inescapable thoughts: if you're driving yourself insane with the ideology that you're choosing to act a certain way, especially something like worrying excessively, an ideal brain would force you to stop those actions so as to prevent the insanity. But the actions keep happening anyways. Almost like it's not a conscious decision but rather the symptom of a chronic disorder.

# Your observations are very flawed:

- Your entire understanding of ""normal"" is your own experiences. Everything about you seems normal *to you*. Then this comes full circle when you try to determine how normal your life: By the symmetric property (a=b -&gt; b=a), all of your experiences appear to be things everyone goes through!
- Everyone else hides what they go through as well. Especially when they also have, for example, depression. So two friends could both have depression and both mask themselves, hiding how they truly deal with things.
- To put it somewhat mathematically, we have source 1 which is calibrated against itself and source 2 which is indeterminately biased positive. We plot each pair on a graph, and manage to draw a best fit line despite the points being all over the place due to source 1 being essentially random. Next we take the data point that represents ourself, but without biasing source 2 upwards, and then find that we are below the line for some reason. In case you couldn't tell, that line is in no way accurate and should *not* be trusted.

# ""But society/my family keeps telling me so!""

Simply put: they're wrong. Just like how your understanding of normal is wrong, so is theirs. They don't really know what it's like to be you; their idea of how someone should act in whatever situation is based on their own selves. So what if you don't fit the arbitrary mold that society conjured? [Insert All Star lyrics]

# ""But my symptoms got worse after I learned more about my disorder!""

Really this essentially the ""doom-saying news problem"": Is the world getting worse or is the news reporting more? Yes, you do notice more symptoms. And in a way, yes, you're choosing to experience them. But that makes *two* ways that you've improved since learning more about what you have.

It's probably obvious why the first part is good. But keep in mind that you easily could have been experiencing those symptoms this whole time without realizing they were those symptoms. For example, I never listen to music in the car or at home, with minor exceptions for at home (mainly Nintendo music and Sheet Music Boss). The idea of choosing to listen to a radio while driving bewilders me. Apparently most people like it. Also I often favor an unplugged electric guitar when practicing music, even though I'd rather be playing my french horn. It's almost like I'm extra sensitive to sound... oh wait a second: Hypersensitivity is a major symptom of autism. And this has been going on long before I knew anything about ASD other than ""bad at making friends"" (in fact I just made the connection recently).

But you're probably mostly wondering why I called it a good thing that you're choosing to suffer.

At work I would have what I used to call ""good days"" and ""bad days"", and that's all I knew of them. Some days I go into work ready to work, others I would be unfocused and very stressed. Nothing bad happened the mornings of the bad days, just having a ""bad day"".

But sometimes, I would have a ""worst day"". These happened approximately monthly, and generally after a series of ""bad days"". On these days I could hardly work. I would keep trying with little success. It would generally start just after arriving, subside a little during lunch, but be even worse by the end of the day. Over time, I started having more and more bad and even worst days. The ""worst days"" eventually became almost weekly.

Once I learned more about autism, I realized those worst days were meltdowns! Now I take a completely different approach when this happens by stopping what I'm doing so I can cry a little or something. Now I haven't had a full meltdown since July. I'll still have those ""bad days"", but by letting them happen they last much shorter and rarely escalate to ""worst days"". **You're not choosing to suffer, you're choosing to let yourself experience natural symptoms.**

# ""But this person has it worse!""

So what if they have it worse? What if you went to the hospital for a broken leg, but someone else had two broken legs? The doctors might put a little more urgency on the other person, but you still have a broken leg which needs treatment. It's a spectrum, where each person falls into a different severity. This even applies to things like downs syndrome; even though the symptoms have no spectrum, how much it affects someone will vary.

If anything, it sounds like a great opportunity for a strong friendship. You both understand how bad it is, or at least that you can't comprehend how bad it is. Also, saying they have it worse implies you *both* have it bad, just different severities.

# An interesting [conclusive] title

You're not making it up. Your problems are completely valid, even if you haven't been diagnosed (diagnosis is still strongly recommended). So don't beat yourself up over these symptoms that are simply not your fault.

Now if you'll excuse me I need to go beat myself up anyways because I posted something publicly. But if anyone has anything to add feel free to share it!",11Nov2018,1
1,"I'm a fourteen year old male and I've always had a stressful life with issues with family and In the past year since I've moved I've become reclusive, only at home not at school. I'll only leave my room maybe twice a day, I only leave if no one's around. I've had a lot of time to think and my conclusion was that maybe because so much of my family was corrupt that I started not to trust any family at all except a sister who I've always been friends with. I feel depressed, hopeless and in general I don't have much will to get out and do anything outside of school. If anyone's been through anything similar, I'd appreciate the help",11Nov2018,1

4,"Need some advice on how to approach my mom in regards to her behavior. We don't live in the same country, but I'm visiting my folks for 3 weeks so I'm trying to figure out what I can do while here.

Growing up my mom ALWAYS had someone outside our family who was her project. It didn't matter if the person was male or female, it was always one person and she would bring them to everything. If we went on vacation to Disney World, this person came along. She would guilt trip us under the guise of helping the person if we just wanted family time to ourselves. Eventually her project would move on and she would fall into deep depression until the next person came along. My dad would argue with her but she would never budge. She definitely is a narcissist. She is never wrong and if she apologizes there's always an excuse or someone to blame. I grew up manipulated emotionally and guilt tripped by her use of ""god"" and what he would do if I was disobedient. Since moving out I've been able to work through my own issues and am fairly recovered. Meditation changed my life and counseling helped.

She's always had trouble with money and has an inability to control her spending. We grew up in a house that was jammed packed with junk. Every possible space was filled with whatever caught her fancy in the moment, even til today in my parents house. When she talks, EVERYthing is AMAZING. Literally everything is the most beautiful, amazing, etc... even if in reality it's very mundane. She's incapable of writing full grammatically correct sentences and most of her writing is in fragments or text speak, even if it's an email. I've always had a hard time understanding her when she talks which she would chalk down to the idea that ""I wasn't at her level"". 

My dad has never been able to reason with her and so over the years he's resorted to complaining to us about her and letting things get out of control. It came to head 3 years ago when her ""project"" was an ex-gangster-turned-to-Jesus-now-musician. She would have him over all the time to practice music and they would jam at my parents house everyday til 12-1am. She cooked him meals, drove him to job interviews, bought him clothes... it was fucking weird. My dad didn't do anything. My brother and I yelled at her multiple times at which she refused to listen and just blamed us or my dad. After that, every time we met it would result in me yelling at her which was new. I've never really fought with her, I normally just get extremely passive aggressive and then end up feeling guilty. I think the new behavior woke her up a little bit as she's finally started to admit to a few things, but still has her main issues. 

I was listening to another family member talk about bipolar symptoms she was working through with a friend that has it. They sound extremely similar to my moms behavior. After doing some research it sounds like my mom has Borderline Personality and needs therapy. The only problem is that she refuses to go when my dad talks to her. She has admitted to having issues not knowing how to act and has slowly opened up. I know she wants to get better (she's currently chasing her dreams as a musician, but not really getting anywhere) but I don't know how to tell her she needs counseling and making sure she follows through. She did her masters in counseling and has said to my dad that she knows it all, she doesn't need it. I know I can't save her, nor do I want to but I want to do whatever I can to help. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL; DR - Mom has Borderline Personality symptoms and I need help trying to figure out how to get her to go to therapy. ",11Nov2018,1

6,"She was okay at first. She was counting calories, eating healthier, and exercising. But lately it's changed to just not eating at all.

She's told me herself that she'll only eat to make her stomach shut up or when she physically can't go on without food. But even when that happens she'll only eat some crackers or a few small pieces of fruit to trick her body into shutting up. Sometimes she says she doesn't eat because her stomach hurts or food would make her nauseous. I've tried to tell her that maybe not eating regularly might be doing that but she won't accept it! Just today when we were at a theme park in the heat ALL DAY all she ate was a small salad and a few grapes and pieces of pineapple. She refuses to eat anything else. I don't know what to do! I've tried to tell her to eat more and that I'm getting worried about her eating habits but she won't listen! She just went through something huge that shattered her confidence and mood and I'm scared that it's going to make it worse. I don't know how to approach this.

i know this subreddit isn’t supposed to give me a diagnosis, but i just need to know what is happening. if it’s okay or not.

a few minutes ago, i had this intense feeling to scream, so i started screaming, easily enough. eventually, my brain felt like it was clouded and full. something that best describes what my mind was like at that time was just black scribbles. dark scribbles. so i started to cry. i felt so angry for no apparent reason &amp; my mom wasn’t really that concerned so like i got even more angry. i felt so overwhelmed with my sudden emotion that i almost fainted. i couldn’t do anything. my mind was just completely full of scribbles. i told my mom that i didn’t know what was happening &amp; that i needed a hug, so i got one and felt a bit better. 

like 5 seconds after that hug, it’s like nothing happened at all. i felt normal, my mind was cleared. the only thing that stayed was my nasty ass face covered with tears. 

this has happened to me many times before. 
suddenly yelling for no reason and start crying w/ my brain feeling so full of emotions that it really hurt. 

my emotions suddenly change for no reason, even if nothing bad affects my day.

it affects my relationship w/ friends and family members &amp; i can’t help it! 

i hang out w/ my friends &gt; is very energetic and happy

a few hours later, we eat lunch together &gt; feels like they all hate me and doesn’t wanna talk to any of them, even though nothing bad happened when we were hanging out.

or

yesterday &gt; going out w/ my best friend and having a blast bc i love her 

tomorrow &gt; seeing her at school &amp; completely ignoring her bc idk???? suddenly it feels like i just don’t want to talk to her like i hate her, but i can talk normally to everyone else??? 

(^ :( i completely hurt her after she had to deal with this for 2 years, and now we are no longer friends.)

or

w/ my mom &gt; feels very comfy &amp; warm

a few mins later &gt; “i hate you!” &amp; i start crying. 

———

i would go to the doctor to ask about these sudden intense feelings of hatred and sadness but,,, parents don’t give a shit at all. they’re like “oh, you can fix it yourself,” but i have no idea what to fix, that’s my problem. 

if anyone can help me to try and understand why i suddenly have these emotions w/ no reasons at all, i will be so happy.

People on the sidewalk were looking at us in shock after that happened because that could've been an ugly situation.

29,"Realizing the only person holding me back is myself. Everything I want to accomplish is still on the table, just have to get the help I need. I want a family of my own one day, and I’m still very young. This potty party I keep throwing isn’t effecting anyone but me. My younger brother and mother need me at my best, and I’m letting them down by caring what others think. Every other week I have overwhelming thoughts about giving up, and that’s not an option anymore. There’s people that care I want in my life who I push away for selfish reasons, and that’s just leaving me alone and upset. No more of that. This week I’m scheduled to see a psychiatrist, so I can can keep this positive mindset. Also a few job interviews I pray God allows me to take advantage of.

31,"Bad crowds will fuck me up. The noise, the amount of people in close proximity. I’ve had full-fledged anxiety attacks at places like the State fair, concerts, Walmart...

So somehow, when I accepted a job at a very busy Target about a month ago, that didn’t cross my mind. 

It wasn’t an issue, until today. Weekend, naturally it was very, very busy. I worked 9 to 5 and was fine until about three, when the crowds started rolling in. 

So much noise. So many people. 

I actually don’t interact with a ton of guests. When you order online from Target, it actually come directly from the store, I’m the person who gets the orders together and boxes them. A lot of my day I’m in the back, either picking items from the back shelves or boxing. I love that part. But I do have to get items from the sales floor too. 

On the outside, I was able to keep it together but on the inside, I was a mess. Why is this so difficult for me? What the fuck is wrong with my brain that big crowds of people fuck me up? 

When I got off, I needed to sit for a minute because according to my step counter I walked six miles today and my legs were tired. So I got a coffee and sat in the Starbucks for a minute.

34,"Hello everyone. First time posting something like this. 

I'm sitting here...god i wish I could just do a video chat or voice chat.

Forgive me ill probably rant on or make a bunch of errors.

I'm a 27 year old male currently working in the film industry.
My work can be very demanding and none rewarding, for the most part, the job I do is also very unappreciated.(like everyone else I'm sure)

I have abandonment issues, parents and siblings all live in separate homes and different states, been that way since I was 14.

My former good friend m(27) found a gf and bailed on me in darkest hour about 5 years ago.

Had another friend who did the same just flip the script on bf and gf.

* I had moved to Portland organ and nearly ended my life, he knew of my situations and yet his gf vagina took priority, crazy thing is his own blood brother had committed suicide that every year as well.* 

Ever since I was kid I was always attracted to the girl's id call friends...not sure if it's simply because I took my time knowing them or that I learned to actually like them as a person and THEN became sexually interested in them. Its always been that way for me.

I've had gfs in the past, they hardly ever work out. They're either boring or I learn that I'm just not interested in them, usually, my female friend (who I'll refer to as Boba) draws my attention away because she's a lot more fun and interesting to hang out with, we simply connected better. 

Now she's had bfs in the past and I've never been jealous of them shit I encouraged her. There was 1 guy but he was a textbook asswhole and she found that out real soon.

Never really had a problem with it though. were just friends after all.

I've been close and very good friends with a Boba(27) since high school  
Recently after nearly 10 years of friendship, I find myself attracted to her and wanting to explore that aspect of a relationship. 
In the back of my mind I know I'm, not her type or at least what she describes. (Feel like we all have kind of our own standards on looks at what not) 
But the feelings are still there.

We recently took a trip to Japan together, walked around Yoyogi park...that's where this confusion started, for the first time, was just kind of in the moment stuck thinking to myself ""id really like to hold her hand"" like dude here we are, two people, from some small as town in the west here in Japan in this beautiful park with the damn flowers blooming and what not...then we went out to a show and just had a blast. The damn train system there had me in a panic because we had to squeeze our bodies so close together we were within kissing distance...damn it was a good night hahaha I didn't go for a kiss though 

*low key kinda scared nowadays with how things are with sexual harassment and what not. So I play it safe, also feels like that kills some of the ""in the moment magic?"" Idk I've never been good with that sorta stuff*

So anyway flash forward to now and here we are back home. 

She'll be leaving soon out of state for work and I'm happy for her, shit get the hell out of California while you can, unfortunately, my industry of work is here so I kinda gotta fight it out. 

I've been thinking lately why not just ask her if she's interested in exploring and relationship with me, im not talking about sex or anything but...maybe just holding hands or hearing how my day was...and maybe once it gets to feel normal (if it ever does) we can try dating until she leaves. She's leaving anyway so why not go for broke?

And if she says no then that's cool, id have my answer and also i could be released from this confusing ass state that im in. We're both mature enough to talk it out, im just scared hahaha, knowing her she would keep me at a distance for a while and that would suck...id get lonely and that abandonment issue would prob throw me into a funk but eventually we'd be back to normal before she left.


I don't even know why im asking the net to hear me out, but i just wanted to see what people thought or hear people's advice or warnings.

Feel like im missing something but eh you guys get the just of it.

o! I think it's perfectly normal to end up liking a friend, shit you spend so much time together its only natural right?

36,"A few months ago I was in a place mentally that I had never experienced before. I was literally in darkness 24/7; I hated everything about myself and was so scared that these feelings were never going to go away.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I went to college all the way across the world. I don't know what it was: maybe it was the nice weather, maybe it was the freedom, maybe it was the chance to start over, or honestly, maybe it was just the fact that everything was new and I was adjusting– I will never know. But the fact of the matter was that I had never felt more free. Mentally, I had never been in a better place.

&amp;#x200B;

But lately, I've been feeling those dark feelings come back. They are not as bad as before, but I'm really scared they will be. I don't know what's happening, I've been doing so well.

There's no spark, there's nothing there to keep me going. I don't want to offend anybody, but living in the American suburbs is so depressing. It's just a maze of strangers with the same house and the same front yard. You see people walking around you but they're all strangers; they're all so close yet so far away. I'm from Spain, and I'm so used to everyday interaction with people, and everybody being friendly on the streets. Idk maybe my nostalgia of Spain is tricking me into thinking that adulthood is supposed to be more exciting, when in reality it isn't.

38,"So as the title states I feel I need some help. I am not in danger of self harm. However the life decisions I have made has gotten me to what feels like a breaking point. I am 26/F in the past I had been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd. I am working at a high pace and high stress job that I actually enjoy which feels scary in and of itself. For the last 5 years I have been binge drinking excessively and smoking weed ocassionally. I have been anxious at work which has caused me to underpreform. My underperformance is causing me to worry and it has been a vicious cycle. 
I am no longer finding enjoyment in things I used to. I can't sleep and eat one meal a day. My apartment is a wreck. I've been putting off responsibilities as well as limiting my social interaction where I am shy to begin with I've pretty much stopped talking to most people other than my husband. 
I am honestly currently debating on going to a hospital tonight. The thought of it has me on edge because it feels scary and like a poor decision. At the same time I feel like I need some serious help getting healthier. I can't live like this anymore. I've been pacing my apartment for the last 3 hours. Everything is overwhelming me.

39,"Before you read on if your looking for a short one it's not I'm sorry.

I want to start off by saying my life isn't a bad one, it's not great but I know I could have it alot worse. To everyone around me I try to be a smiling happy, 'just relax' person, someone I have always strived to be, someone to inspire others or just be helpful, but sadly I'm a ""do as I say not as I do"" case, inside all I feel is empty and hatred. I hate myself, I hate everything about me, I honestly want to die but am too scared to actually pull the trigger and I suppose this is the only help I want to get, by using a burn account talking to randoms on the internet. I have tried to ""just be happy"", have taken anti-depressants but none of them seem to work after taking them for long periods of time, what's the point in buying something if it doesn't help.

I want to be happy, I want to be the person everyone thinks I am, but I'm not, I'm lost in my own head with seemingly no way out and that only makes me feel worse. I don't think that life is one I can have so if I could I'd rather just walk through life fucked up on drugs, numb to the world but still living, what everybody but me wants, a middle of the road in a way. I refuse to talk to anyone close to me about how I feel because the few times I have I just get dismissed and told to do [Insert Thing Here] and I'll be all better. I have tried...same result.

Let's say I do though and they won't do that to me, I refuse to put myself in such a vulnerable position, one where someone can completely destroy me (or what's left of ""me"") so easily with whatever I confide in them. I'm too cautious of what I have left to do so, and for the ""Oh go see a psychologist"" people. No. I refuse to believe even a single fucking word of someone who gets paid to listen to problems, if they give me the right one or not it doesn't fucking matter they get paid ether way so why should I believe some random ""professional"" would help me when they don't know anything about me, don't have some personal connection to me, and get paid to say whatever ""professional opinion"" they have and have me believe them.

I'm lost I don't see anyway that I can be happy and would rather null the pain with pills (no I'm not messed up on drugs, currently or ever) or end my own life so I won't ever have to deal with it again, everyone wants me alive, but what's the point in living if you can't enjoy it.

I don't know if anyone feels exactly the way I do with what I have put out there, but I figure I'd put this swan song out here before I do something that I know will hurt other's, but will give me the release I want. I don't trust anyone's opinion here, I will listen though, it's my last chance. I figure that since nobody is getting paid to read this, nor is getting paid to comment anything that I at least trust your opinion more (and will hear it out completely) than I would someone close to me who can hurt me, or someone who get's paid to give people answers, be they right or wrong in the end.

To anyone who might feel what I feel or even something close to it, at least ask for help in some form before you make your potential final decision, even if it is opening yourself up on a burn account for randoms on the internet to help or mock. Thank you for you time.",11Nov2018,1
40,"Im currently 31 years old and two years ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and now I seriously belief it’s a misdiagnosis. Before I went to therapy I began researching bipolar and basically self diagnosed myself, so (I know this is wrong) I began explaining some stories that would help the bipolar narrative. She thought I may have a bad case of ADHD with depression and anxiety, which today I would agree with. Anyway, I then told her stories of when I was 19-23, times where I caused a lot of property damage and vandalism. After these stories I was diagnosed as bipolar 1. The thing is those stories I told were bad but they were when I was very immature, seeking attention, and bored. I haven’t acted like that in years, and that’s before medication. Well anyway, I was prescribed with lamactil which I really didn’t feel, but I will say it did make me able to brush certain annoyances a little better. The lamactil made me break into a rash and then I just stopped going. Present day: I recently started seeing a new Pdoc and therapist. I went  because me depression and anxiety were so high. I told them about my past diagnosis and they assumed it was correct. I was prescribed ambilify. The day after taking it I began to want to leave my wife, even asking her if I could leave to the west coast to start a new career. This type of (manic) behavior I have never experience and it lasted about 5 days, then the next 5 were stable. Then I couldn’t sleep. In four days I got about 14 hours sleep and no sleep on the fifth.My anxiety was through the roof too, I was afraid of pillows suffocating me and dehydrating in my sleep. I was so tired but when I would try to sleep my heart would race, the anxiety was so bad I would pace for hours. On the fifth day I was seeing my therapist and she was worried about me. Told my she thought I was manic because of all the neurosis. She made an emergency appointment with my pdoc and he thought I was manic and the anxiety was making it worse. He doubled the ambilify and prescribed me larazepam. The larazepam helped the anxiety and I went right to bed. Next day doubled the ambilify and now the anxiety is back but twice as worse. This anxiety is the worse ive ever had and im thankful the larazepam helps a bit.So my questions are:
Could ambilify caused this anxiety and/or mania?
Should I bring up the fact on why I don’t think im bipolar to my therapist?

I’m a long time lurker of reddit but I’ve never joined in on any threads. However, I feel this is probably the right place to post this.

I’ve always been quite a melancholy person, even as a child, but I always figured this was part of the human condition. Hence, I’ve just got on with things. Unfortunately, over the last few years, I feel that I’ve started experiencing things that aren’t necessarily typical. It started with hearing whispers in the background and then developed into a feeling that I was dead and everything around me was a simulation of what would have happened if I were still alive. After convincing myself that I wasn’t dead I decided that I was some sort of deity. 

I know this sounds completely bizarre and I struggle to come go grips with it, even typing it out is quite embarrassing for me because despite the ridiculousness of it I can’t dispute what I believe in my head. Furthermore, I often get an impression that people hate me.

I know this all reads quite disjointed but I just wanted to tell somebody. I want to tell my friends and perhaps a doctor but I don’t want people to treat me differently. 

Basically, I’d quite like some advice on what to do please.

Anyways, I have been fairly depressed and somewhat suicidal for the past year or so now, and have tried once to take my life, but I barely even have the energy to try now. I find no enjoyment from literally anything, including masturbation. It's not like I've been masturbating every single day so that I dont enjoy it due to the oversaturation - in fact it's almost been 2 months. But after trying to jack off for the past couple hours I have been completely unable to even get stiff or cloud my mind enough to enjoy. The whole goal with masturbation in the first place was to st least calm me down or take my mind off things so I could at least sleep but that isn't happening as well. I dont know what I should do, I've gone to a counselor before for my depression, missed a day, and never rescheduled, and I have to wait 3 more weeks before I'm screened again so I can get meds. I dont entirely know if i even want to wait 3 weeks at this point too, I'm just so tired of everything and I've failed so many, but that's not the point of this post. It's very hard to get out of bed and do something when you get no pleasure from anything; work, games, money, masturbation, even my dog now cant make me smile, or feel even the slightest amount of happy.

* Twitches a bit, touches his nose a lot, laughs a lot too
* Says he has a very weird vibe and feeling emanating from his dorm room (seems perfectly fine to me)

48,"Hello everyone,

I am a 13 year old male and I need a lot of help. I apologise if this post is very long.

For the past month or so my mind has gone mad. I don't know what is going on. I've been trying to figure out what it is for the past month or so. I have many small problems but I'm trying to find the big problem. I just feel so overwhelmed, in fact I feel so overwhelmed right now I just feel like destroying something. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS MAKING ME SO OVERWHELMED!!! IS IT ALL MY PROBLEMS?!?!?!

My mind feels so overwhelmed. Whenever I try to think I just feel like screaming in my mind. Whenever I have to do steps or something is complicated or takes a long time I feel like screaming and getting angry or something. I only do things like ""quick fixes."" For example, I want to learn how to have self control. If I say a website that says ""10 steps to get better at self control"" it just makes me feel so irritated and angry. But if I say a website that says ""One quick trick to having self control"" I don't get that same reaction. I guess I like trying to simplify things a lot. Also, even when I'm reading your comments and they don't give me exactly what I need it makes me feel like screaming these days if I have to calm down and read it. For example if you say something like ""Give this a try"" it makes me feel like screaming because its like your not certain. Or when people who have the same problem as me who haven't yet got rid of it give me advice. Please don't take this personally. I'm just trying to be honest. 

My mind is so cluttered and mad. I don't know how much longer I can take it. Sometimes I feel like my mind is about to explode. I feel like no one will ever understand what I'm talking about or understand me. I feel like my mental state is like a secluded person that lives on a planet with no one else. I just want to know what my problem is. 

Every week I've been telling myself I'm going to solve it and finally be happy and normal again but I keep procrastinating. I've tried web counselling and I got too frustrated with all the ""try this"" and calmness and stopped. A lot of the time I feel like crying because I don't know if I will ever get out of this state.

And I also am anxious that, if I get out of this state, what if I didn't do what I did to get out of the state? What if I was stuck like that forever? What if me getting out of that mental state was just a fluke?

My goal is to come to the root of the problem and fix it. I think I might know what the root of the problem is but I'm not sure. I may be experiencing burnout from stress.

See, before this month I was extremely stressed I believe. Now that I remember on a side note, I like to compare myself to others a lot and try and seem better than them, that's just something I noticed. I say this because maybe I'm not more stressed than others; For example, I feel sorry for myself because I think I work so much. But what if other people my age in my class work the same amount and don't mind (I don't know if they work as much as me)? Now I think of it, guess it makes me feel like what I'm feeling is invalid. Anyway, back to what I was saying.  So prior to this month I was extremely stressed (I think). 

I woke up at 5 am, studied for around 15 minutes, cleaned the house for around 15 minutes. At 5:30 am I would take a shower and get ready by 6 am. We would have family prayers at 6. At 6:30 or so we would finish and I would begin cleaning and packing school things. At 7:30 am we would leave for school. When I came back from school, I cleaned for about an hour. Then I had a long long list of todo items that I had made for myself for self improvement and fixing things about myself that I didn't like (it was far too much). On top of that I had at least 1 hour homework. I would probably finish everything by around 10 or 10:30 pm with no time to play or anything like that. Then I would go to sleep and repeat every weekday. On Saturdays, I have to wake up at around 7:30 am and I have to start cleaning after prayer. Then I have to go outside and work in the garden and with the animals (I'm afraid of animals) I might finish by around 12 or 1 pm. Then I have to clean the kitchen and the rooms (if I hadn't done it in the morning). From then on I'm pretty much free but I used to keep working on my todo list. I did this for around 6 months, non-stop. I still do the exact same thing for weekends (except the todo list) and very similar for weekdays (but more rest). So I guess this must have made me burnout, which is a medical condition. Please remember I'm 13. I'm just not sure whether I have burnout or whether its something else though I can relate with it a lot. [https://au.reachout.com/articles/burnout-and-chronic-stress](https://au.reachout.com/articles/burnout-and-chronic-stress)

I have a lot of personal problems as well; dozens. One of the main ones is organisation. I feel really cluttered and overwhelmed. I need to work on them because they affect me on a daily basis.

I have been hearing a voice in my head since I was little. I have ignored it my entire life. It only says negative things about people or ""truths"" and why they cant be trusted. It makes me believe they are always out to get me. For the most part my religion has kept me from acting out on its suggestions.

When I am alone I can sense its presence/voice and it gets stronger telling me to kill myself. Also I get extremely angry when I get criticized. When I hear fighting/arguing/ loud voices it makes me very frustrated and angry.

51,"So I was suffering from some sort of disconnection with my Identity disorder/memory disorder. It was weird, for 3 years I never felt like myself. Like my memories and personality did not connect. Anyways I've cured it. (Basically I went through a very tramatic experience then my dad had a brain aneurysm which I believe overloaded my circuits) anyways, I was depressed/having this problem for 3 years.

53,"My Aunt is a single mother of a very difficult 13 year old son. Her ex husband is a narcissist who cannot manage to sustain a relationship for more than a few years and has managed to make all of his children resent him. The 13 year old son has grown up without a father figure, has virtually no friends, is misbehaved, extremely picky to the point of borderline emaciation(he looks like he is 9) and it is apparent that he is miserable inside. He craves attention but everyone except his mother and grandmother have no interest in spending time with him, because of his bad manners and his insulting nature. His mother is a truly wonderful, compassionate individual, but I believe she is incapable of adequately disciplining her child. She feels sorry for him that he hasn't had much of a childhood, and as a result she often doesn't fully follow through with disciplinary action. If he misbehaves, she will threaten him with consequences, but only follow through with 60 percent of it. He is an intelligent child and realizes that he can often get away with things. On the one hand he truly adores his mother, on the other hand he doesn't realize the amount of frustration that she is experiencing. He also suffers from dyslexia, which makes certain subjects very difficult for him and makes him somewhat of an outsider at school. I am deeply concerned about my Aunt, as it is very obvious that the stress is killing her. She can't sleep at nights due to worrying, and she has a number of health conditions which are probably linked to stress. Her job is frustrating at times, her ex husband constantly gives her shit, and her life revolves around her son who has all of these issues. She takes very little time for herself, and is the kind of person that cares for others before she cares for herself.  They have both been going to therapy for years, but it has resulted in little improvement. They have managed to improve his diet a little bit but the behavioral issues haven't improved as far as I can tell.

I don't understand mindfulness but it sounds like it could solve my current issues. I have what can only be described as 'prolonged' panic attacks that last for weeks at a time. I'm able to function normally but can never quite catch my breath. Some days it's worst than others.

I was doing really well this year. I lost some weight, started learning to drive, and I felt good. Now all of that stuff, along with other stuff I've been trying to do, makes my brain jump from one thing to the next. I'm not really 'present' at all and when I am, I'm just shutting myself away.

I could kick myself for it.

Any time I call my parents, receive a message from them, any kind of contract with them instantly results in me breaking down and even sometimes crying. Anything reminding me of home makes me incredibly sad, and nothing I've tried fixes this. Lately I've been calling them even more, thinking more contact would calm me down, but nothing changed. I manage to see them about once or twice a week for half a day, but that too doesn't help

I've never had this happen to me before when traveling alone, or staying away from my parents. Why now?

60,"Forgive what is probably going to be word salad. I'm at work, on midnights, and having an episode so I'm struggling to focus. But its starting to ebb so I'm going to post here now for accountability.  If I wait I'll get to that point where I tell myself I was overreacting and once again pretend like it never happened.

I've never posted here before. I've never told this to anyone. Not my parents nor my wife.  I've hinted at it very subtly through lyrics to songs I've written, but that's it. 

I have these episodes, particularly in times of stress, or when I'm on midnights. In my head it's like being in a small room with thousands of scraps of paper flying around. Just hauling ass. Like a tornado but more chaotic. Tornados have a shape, some kind of rhyme and reason. This is madness. Written on each scrap of paper is a problem. Not like a math problem but a very real issue in my life. I'm standing in the center of this room just trying to get ahold of just one, any one piece of paper. So I can figure it out and move on. There's a cacophony of noise. Barking dogs, the roar of wind, the swishing of paper, buzzing. So loud the walls shake. All I want is to grab these scraps of paper and at the very least get them organized. But between the malestrom of paper and the incredible noise, I cant focus. I grab wildly for something, anything. But theres only noise.
While this is going on in my head I feel a weight on my chest, as if someone were sitting there. The cherry on top is the panicked feeling that I'm forgetting something. Sometimes it feels like I forgot to do or get something. Sometimes it's more urgent, sometimes it feels like how I imagine I would feel if I was in a crowd far from home and couldn't find my daughter. 

The only way these episodes would stop used to be by going to sleep. I cant sleep anymore. So I'd drink. That helped at first. Until it didnt. So now I drink more. Now if I try to sleep sober the storm starts and the dogs start and now I cant sleep at all if I'm sober. I've tried and I stay up for days.

I've been going to therapy for a while now &gt;2 years and I haven't improved. I'm 14 years old and am close enough to 15 and I feel worse than when I started the treatment process.

Recently I went to see my psychologist and she said that she 'can't do anything' to help me. Over the past few sessions she has been saying that I'm 'functional' and not listening to me but now that she has admitted that she can't help me, I don't know what to do. We have another session next week but I feel like she is going to discharge me as she has mentioned it a lot in the recent sessions.

I've been really hopeless and so fucking close to just killing myself but there's a tiny bit of hope left that maybe she will find someone else at her workplace who could help me (?). I've never done medication for mental stuff but I doubt she will let me do that.

You're a crazy fucking bitch."" ending it with ""I've been holding that in for a long time."" All I could muster was ""get out, and give me your key."" The words cut through me like glass. This isn't the first time this has happened, as it seems the majority of times I try to express my feelings I'm labeled as crazy. 

Truth be told I haven't felt the same since my friend died. I can't be touched. Can't be kissed. I have no desire for anything sexual whatsoever. Perhaps I'm not capable of being in a relationship right now. I thought my partner understood, we talked about it so many times and I expressed that I haven't been the same since I found out she was dead, and I don't know how to be how I was before. I don't know how to live like I did before. Everything has gone dark and meaningless, and I'm constantly fearing that I'm going to die soon. 

My friends and family don't get it either. Another thing I'm fearing every day is that my mother will die or my sister. I don't think I can handle another loss. I don't think I can handle one more person's abuse and wrongful doing towards me, my life has been a series of  people hurting over and over since my early childhood. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I can't sleep, and when I do I have nightmares of drowning (how she died) and I wake up gasping for air, and nightmares of my own corpse haunting me and trying to send me some sort of subliminal messages. She tells me I'm killing her. Another reoccurring dream where a man with no face sits on my chest and slowly cuts my face with a shard of glass. One of my most recent developments to my death phobia is being murdered. I don't see my new therapist until December, I really hope it helps. 

Until then I don't know what to do. My support system is shit. I can no longer bear to live alone, something I used to love, as I was once very independent. I feel like a small child again, afraid of the big bad scary world and the people in it. ",11Nov2018,1
65,"I really want to ask a doctor about this but before I do, I want to see what people think here first. I am using an older throw-away account so no old friends notice it. I have never told ANYONE about this before.

A little backstory. I am 22 but still watch kids cartoons/other animated shows almost exclusively. Even though I enjoy a lot of live action shows, when I get home after work or university, I look forward to these shows so much that I NEED them to help me get to sleep most nights. These select few shows are the perfect escape and I get a great feeling of being there when I watch them. It still has that effect but years ago, as I got older, things changed a little. The routine has only gotten more important. A few years ago, I was in Japan for 6 months and hated it. I hated most of the people that were in my building and whenever the day was done, I NEEDED cartoons and I really did like going to be alone to watch them (by the way, I am not talking about anime). Most of the time, it felt good to always have those. I think this was the first time (or one of the first) that I had realizations that the worlds in the cartoons weren't real and that the characters didn't really lead lives somewhere out there. When I watch the shows in a ""good"" mood all I feel is bliss, like somewhere these universes co-exist out there somewhere and it really possible to ""be there"". It's very hard to explain this feeling but when it is there, it is like a veil stopping me from thinking about the truth. When I ""realize"" I am just watching TV, I get this feeling that I am tricking myself, that no world this perfect exists, or that because these shows are just shows, these worlds are frozen in a perfect era, like I am getting older and older and people around me will die, things will always change and one day I will die, and as these shows or episodes become dated, I get the feeling like they've happened in the past (when they aired for the first time) and now it's like I'm watching old nostalgic videos of what once happened, and that I am just sitting ALONE watching them, which makes me loose the bliss that I had watching them before when I felt like I was there. It is also hard to explain how my mind runs wild with these thoughts. When they do, the shows can loose the thing that made them the perfect escape for me, and there has never been anything that made me feel like that before, even when I don't notice it while it's happening. As time has gone on this feeling has gotten worse and worse. Now it comes up constantly. I love coming home to my shows, but every few days or so, it hits hard (mostly when I have time to think) and I am desperately trying to calm these feelings. When it does, I feel like a family died, and I start crying a lot, sometimes when I am driving or at home, or even sometimes in public (but I really really fight off crying when this happens). I now think about crazy ways that it will all work out in the end. Thinking that if there are other universes, maybe one is like that. Or that if I die, anything can happen, and I might get my own version of heaven where I can finally be there. I'll even think about that Twilight Zone where you live out your life in a simulation without knowing there is a world out there. I am so deeply depressed by this, I would do ANYTHING to have the chance of these happening. It's just getting so hard to accept it. I know these sound like stupid crazy-fan thoughts, and that's why I have never told anyone because it is to hard to explain in a way people understand and really just embarrassing that my brain has actually considered these subconsciously. In the back of my mind, there always has to be a way. When I'm not consumed with these thoughts, I can enjoy the shows for what they are and it can get me though literally anything. In these times, I think that I don't need a doctor or any help anymore, but I just keeping dipping back into it more and more frequently, and my thoughts keep getting crazier. I can't loose the way these shows made me feel.

I am sure that no one notices the way I feel about this when I am around them. I try to keep it together when out in my day. Some close people know some of the shows I watch, but they probably just think of me as a huge fan of them. Also, I don't think that I have the socially awkward personality some people associate with fans that are too into a fandom. I don't have social anxiety (I'm not talkative but it's kind of a choice since my interests are different). I have been in a lot of hard situations where I've been on my own, sometimes far away from home, and deal with the problem without stressing out. I also don't think I have any learning disability, autism or anything like that. What I'm trying to say is, I don't really think that it is a side-effect of one of these things. It stands alone as something that is ruining my life more and more every year and only seems to get worse with time. It is definitely not a phase or a one time thing.

I don't think I can ever stop the way I think of these things but it has helped a little sitting and getting it out for the first time ever, but I did cry trying to write some of this. I am curious if this is something that has happened to people before (or documented), or if someone completely understands the panic I get when I realize a TV show or fictional world isn't real. I promise this isn't fake and that it is very real to me, it is just not something I want to talk about with people that know me personally. In the past few months, I have thought multiple times about seeing what a doctor has to say about it.",11Nov2018,1

So the problem at the moment? When I'm talking to her she'll suddenly think she's 11 (she's 14 atm). She'll not remember who I am and think I'm someone she's being forced to have sex with. Or that I'm her ex or something along those lines. She's also completely forgotten that she's had a baby. She's convinced herself that she had an abortion (as per what her parents told her to do. Her voices know she didn't though. Memory is a confusing mess) so maybe its something to do with bringing something that powerful back???

Has anyone come across anything like this? She doesn't have a GP but I told her to call 111 for advice, but its always better to have as many people as possible trying to find an answer

76,"One of the most frustrating and least talked about aspects of living with a mental illness is that frequently our entire emotional experience of life is attributed to mental illness.  This undermines the legitimacy of our experiences.

Yes, we have illnesses that affect the processing of thoughts and emotions.  However, that does not negate the legitimacy of our human experience.

For example, almost everyone's nervous when going for a job interview.  It's an entirely normal emotional response.  Where mental illness comes into play is to take that entirely normal emotional response and take it to a level where you can't function, much less actually go into the job interview.

No one is confident all the time.  I have never met a person that didn't at least once look in the mirror and criticize their appearance.  

It is an entirely normal part of the human experience to go through periods of self doubt and confusion.  That is NOT a sign of mental illness.  Life is a confusing journey with so many more twists and turns than we are lead to expect when we are young.  It's not easy.  And it's not easy for everyone.  We're all faced with challenges that we never expect and don't really know how to handle.

The emotional reactions of those with mental illness are normally rational and sane things.  We all have anxiety.  We all have fear.  We all have hurt and sadness and all of it.  All of it are entirely normal reactions.

Mental illness doesn't deligitimize our emotional experience.  What mental illness is is that we have issues with processing entirely normal experiences.  And this issue is entirely, completely based in the functioning of the brain.  It's neurological.

Let me give an example....

The neurotransmitters that are naturally released during times of stress are dopamine, acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA.  What neurotransmitter is the primary player in hallucinations?  Dopamine.  That's right.  Hallucinations are the abberant variety of a natural stress reaction.  An entirely normal and understandable reaction turned into a processing issue by neurology.

I am so tired of seeing not just those without mental illness, but those with it too accredit our entire life experiences to mental illness.  It's just not true.  First and foremost, we are people.  We live relatively normal lives.  We get up, we get a cup of coffee, we face the world as best we can.  And that's exactly what everyone else does.

By attributing our entire emotional experience to mental illness, it not only deligitimizes our experiences, it also greatly increases the supposed divide between us and those who are neurologically healthy.  And that divide should never be there in the first place.

My therapist taught me a very simple way to explain the difference between rational thought and mental illness.  If the majority of people experience the same thoughts, it's rational and normal.  That's it.  And we all have an outstanding tool to know if it is.  If we can't talk to others about it, there's Google.  

Mental illness doesn't deligitimize our thoughts.  It just changes our abilities to process them.

People with mental illnesses can have entirely normal emotional reactions to entirely normal life experiences. 

It's hard enough to have the world tell us that ""You don't feel that way.  You're just crazy.""  Do we seriously have to keep doing it to ourselves?

You have an illness.  It doesn't mean that your entire life is that illness.  It only means that you have some issues with processing.  That's it.

Your experience as a person is whole, complete, and valid.  And having a mental illness doesn't deligitimize your experience in the least.",11Nov2018,1
77,"Me and this girl started dating about 4 years ago we were absolutely obsessed with each other. To this day I still have not made that type of connection with anyone like the way I did with my ex. We were always by each others side. She had some issues at home though, which made her have anger problems. (Not when she was around me) she would always get into fights with other girls and eventually someone pressed charges which got her sent to a program for girls for 8 months. We were writing letters to each other every week, we both couldn’t wait to hear from each other. And we both were dying we see each other. When she finally came home we were both so happy to be with each other again. About 2 months after she came home I woke up to a text from here saying we should break up. I was devestated, it completely blindsided me cause it was like one day we were inseparable best friends and the next day she didn’t want me anymore. After she broke up with me I knew it was hard for her to let go also because we would still text exchanger once or twice a day and occasionally we would still hang out. But then one day I texted her saying I was nervous about starting a new job hoping she would offer some support but instead she told me to “grow some balls” and other hurtful things. So that was the last time i talked to her. ):  as days went by I felt myself falling into a depression, wanting to do nothing but be alone in bed all day in a dark room. Completely shutting myself off from the world. I would always “check up” on her social media just to see how she was doing. She crossed my mind every day knowing how much I missed her. I found out a month after we broke up that she already had a new boyfriend. One month after getting out of a 2 year relationship. That made me mad, wondering why this kid was worthy of having her. Eventually I got over that though. 

I would occasionally text her younger sister asking how everything was going and how my ex was doing and I would do the same with her mother. Only because I grew so close to her family within the two years we were dating. They would tell me things like “Ashley’s boyfriend can’t hold a job for more than a week” and “she has bruises on her arm, we think she is hitting her” this really really sunk me. Because I gave that girl me everything, even stopped hanging out with my friends to cater to her. It made me feel like no one wanted me cause if I did all that for someone just to drop me for some scumbag. About a week ago, I blocked her on social media along with her mother and sister so that I could completely cut off any reminders about her. 

This hasn’t helped. 

I still think about her every day hoping she is doing okay, and missing her. Wishing I could just have one more conversation with her. I also make myself mad by remembering that she abandoned me for some undeserving scumbag. I also just can’t bring myself to try talking to new girls because I still with that I was with my ex. Never ever in my whole 20 years of living have I ever connected with someone like I did my ex girlfriend. Please if anyone can give some helpful advice on how to get over her it would be life saving. Literally. It’s been 2 years since we’ve broken up and she’s still stuck in my head every day. ",11Nov2018,1

81,"Trigger warning as I go in depth into some of my problems involving suicide.

TL;DR - Suicide planning only put more of a weight on me killing myself. Trashing those plans and releasing that weight didn't make the problems go away, but it did create a distance between me and my suicidal thoughts.

I've had on and off suicidal thoughts for a while. Recently was when they were at their worst. For the past few months since I got back to college, I... (In this order)
- Relapsed
- Found out my best friend (and lots of the friend group we hung around) was abusive.
- Found out I get codependent with anyone who isn't abusive.
- Lost happiness in doing things I loved.
- Lost love and passion for my major.
- Lost happiness in some of the people I hung around.
- Started hating people who were happy.
- Started hating people who had friends visit them.
- Developed physical health problems that are still unknown or unresolved right now after three Doctors visits.
- Started getting ghosted by the few people who still made me happy and didn't do anything about it because I wanted to respect their privacy.
- Worsened my fear of being abandoned.

All this stuff happened and I didn't know what else to do. Suicide felt so easy. And it felt easier after a recent encounter with a game that dealt with suicide and mental health issues. The shock factor only furthered my curiosity. I refused to admit that last part until now.

I went to a suicide subreddit, which I will not specifically reference, and posted my problems. Not much came out of it but I decided to just let it be. One of my friends found that post and knew it was me. Everything I posted was private from my outside life until then but one common post between Reddit and Facebook was found. She didn't tell me that for a while, but for the first time in three years someone was discouraging my suicidal thoughts and it was the first time I felt any reason not to do it.

It wasn't enough, as I still went through every week unable to avoid due to our schedules being identical the people who kept encouraging my suicidal thoughts with jokes and taunts. I only got to be around people that truly made me happy once a week, which created my codependency, which made me easily triggered when they didn't respond to my texts, which made me feel lost and worried about abandonment, which made my mental health suicidal thoughts worse.

I started writing letters and truly committing to the idea of suicide. Once I had finished those letters, the urge was everywhere. It felt more real than ever. I was ready to do it last night and the panic attacks got so bad that I passed out.

When I woke up, I took those letters and trashed them. I then went on Reddit and unsubscribed from the suicide subreddit and fell back asleep. The moment I woke back up, the suicidal thoughts were still lingering but they weren't all over the place. I don't know how long that will hold, but it was the first time I was able to think about anything else for nearly a week.

Moral of the story: If you have suicide letters laying around, trash them. If you have an urge to write letters, fight it. See what that does. I can't guarantee it will do much but I definitely could've had a better weekend without those letters existing.",11Nov2018,1

Counselor basically said I just have to live with it. I have been on dozens of meds and at best it only makes it fleeting, at worst one med constantly gave me visions and urges to rip my eyes out and scary shit like that. No one in my family really understands what it is like internally. Always worrying 'what if I just snap one day out of desperation or confusion'. They just pass it off as me being angry at someone but it is not like that because I could have no malice to the person and still have visions of caving their skull in.",11Nov2018,1
83,"I dont know where to begin really,

Im the youngest of 4 children, 3 older sisters,  was the only boy. 
Around the age of 6 my parents divorced, i didnt really comprehend what that meant or felt the real impact of it, but i do believe thats partly what made me and my dad grow apart.

Not that we were close, he was a functioning alcoholic, went to bars after work so never really spent time with us, he was never abusive in any way or so, but just not being around made my mom hate him so they split up.

So every other weekend me and my sisters went to my dad.
I dont remember a lot from back then but i do remember sometimes we'd go over to his job (some computer consulting kinda place) to play quake or unreal tournament or something which is the fondest memory I have of him but regardless there's a weird lingering voidness making me feel like we never really truly connected.

A thought that keeps popping up is that i never saw either my mom or dad ever be in a situation where, whether together or in future altrecations with different people, they were having fun in flirting or other ways that you see in happy relations with different genders, like teasing and stuff..

So when i was 10 there was this girl in my class in fancied and i mustered up all my courage to confess my love, and because i was too terrified to talk up in person, i wrote on little post-it notes how she was the prettiest girl with the brightest smile etc.. really all the works, made it into a little bundle tied together with some nice lint i stole from my mom (defeats the purpose of post-it notes but whatever) and put in her little mailbox in class, then the next morning i saw her reading it together with her bestie, and how they proceeded to make fun of it, and more importantly, me. That just shattered me, and now, 16years later, it sits there on the back of my head, waiting on any and every occasion it gets to jump out of the bushes and fuck me up when i least expect it.
But that day was where i first thought i wasnt like the other kids, i was different somehow, i couldn't be vocal like the others.

So there's that, and believe that's a big part of it. But with time i somewhat recovered and that memory got supressed for a long time, life went on.

Now my dad, for as much as i know him has a pretty passive personality, and my mom is more of an energetic extroverted person.  she was more of a role model, but she was bitter towards my dad, because he didn't pay allemony on time or stuff like that, so growing up i heard a lot of my dad being a piece of shit, but telling a 7-10 year old his father's a piece of shit, you're basically telling your kid he's 50% a piece of shit. So thinking back that didn't really help my self esteem.

So not having a positive male rolemodel in a time where hormones were coming in was a weird place to be, and having three older sisters made it embarrassing liking girls so I couldn't really openly or honestly come to terms with my sexuality. 

But with time i did get some girlfriends, but it didn't really mean anything yet, i wasnt yet love. It was childish

Then about the age of 18 i really fell in love, and somehow it worked, we met through mutual friends on a festival so there was any initial anxiety as there would be in approaches or something. But about 6 months later shit went south. She broke up with me and i really got depressed, i wanted to kill myself, for the first time, i felt truely hopeless, like it was all over, i wanted everything to end, but i was too scared to end it or to seek help, so like any other thing i ever did, i half assed it, and ate a bunch of pain killers and muscle relaxers and maybe 4 or 5 sleeping pills and i woke up in the hospital getting my stomach pumped

Enough to pass out and get my mom to notice i needed help, i ended up in a mental facility for a couple months because they still wanted me to be able to finish school, i didnt really get better but they got me on meds so my emotions were just a flat line, i couldn't give 2 shits about anything, but i did finish school, and at that time being freed from the daily rourines, having a job was the last thing i wanted. but with school no longer being a daily occupation of the mind, your head starts going places, and mine found its way into some dark arts. 

Damn this is a fucking book, im gonna cut it short, im sorry for anyone still reading

So growing up as i did i'm terrified of getting to know people in any romantic or sexual way. 
And now finally having a steady full time job, i feel like I'm just wasting time, I'm not getting any younger, and i feel like im stuck, my relationship s with my friends and family are getting worse and i see no way of meeting new people 

I dont know if anyone can help in any way, not that i expect anyone to, but if anyones interested in the rest of the story, just ask, because i did leave out a lot that is probably relevant to me feeling like shit",11Nov2018,1

85,"Kinda been getting to a tipping point of how much anxiety im beginning to feel when it comes to forming romantic relationships. I get extremely paranoid/jealous that whoever im talking to is fucking/dating/into someone else and i just start to shutdown emotionally and start to shell up. 

I get suuper possesive of girls that i to talk to. Not like physically possessive, but emotionally in my own head, if that makes sense. If a girl i like shows interest/in the slight bit flirty to another guy, i just start to shut down and i cant focus on anything else. Its not just one thought when it happens either, i constantly ruminate over specific things that have happened and how that could mean this or that. I go through every possible scenario in my head, using things/feelings i see in real life to rationalize every possible bad scenario and then obsess over it constantly. I have been trying to stop these thoughts from affecting me by either acknowledging them in the moment or telling myself to stop when I begin to obsess over certain thoughts but its hard.  

Like for example theres this girl (called M) that im close friends with. We have grad school 8 hours a day, so were literally with each other for 40 hours a week. I have feelings for her. Last night I was at a party that she couldnt make it to and one of our friends asked where she was. I  said she was feeling a bit antisocial and he said something like ""you couldnt convince her?!"" and then went on his phone and starting texting something. I then heard him on on the phone saying  ""where the fuck are you"" in like a jokingly way. Just from this, i started shutting down. ""Who was he talking to? Was it M? They're that close they can call each other? She hasnt been texting my lately but theyre texting? She does seem flirty with him a lot.""  This is just an example of the shit that goes through my mind..just an endless pathway..I find one small thing and rationalize it to the worse thing possible. I recognized that in the moment and was able to stop obsessing over it too much in the moment. 

I know i have no idea who he was talking to. Or even if he was talking to M, theres nothing wrong with that. Me and M are friends and theres no reason that I should feel entitled to her attention.. But i fucking do. And i just get this sinking feeling in my gut. Its the worst because ive been right before, and it just fuels the negativity. Im beginning to control how much i obsess over these thoughts (at least im aware of it and can consciously think to stop) but I dont know how to handle these feelings appropriately. I thought they were normal to a certain extent but now im beginning to think its way to much. ",11Nov2018,1

I've never been diagnosed but I think I might have PTSD because everytime someone yells at me I can't help but cry, even when it's nothing important I just cry. For a better example, during an argument my boyfriend kind of raised his voice at me, it wasn't an angry argument, I know I'm not in danger, I know he's not really mad but I cried. It makes me feel terrible because I don't want this to be the way I get away with things in my relationship, my boyfriend is so nice whenever this happens he just hugs me or tell me it's ok and the argument is never properly ended.

90,"I'm a bit conflicted as to what to do. I suffer with anxiety and depression. My anxiety is being medicated with propranolol to control its physical manifestations, but of course I still get the very anxious thoughts. But that's beside the point.

&amp;#x200B;

I was given the propranolol in June/July by a general practitioner, and I felt like I was able to cope a bit better with my anxiety because of it. I would still have doubtful thoughts, but all the embarrassing manifestations of it were reduced and it made coping much easier. Because of this, my depression also flared down a bit as I was not getting down about my anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm starting to notice some of the symptoms of depression starting to creep back in - I'm getting regular ""weak"" headaches in the same spot I was before, my sleep is becoming more interrupted, I'm starting to neglect academic activity, I feel as if I just want to start crying 80% of the time, any small inconvenience is a tragedy to me... what should I do? Earlier this year, I almost killed myself because of it. I want to think I'm in a better place but I honestly think I'm at the top of a slope down to my lowest point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did counselling for the depression and anxiety to little avail.

I start to act like all of my thoughts were real, like they actually abandon me.

I know this may all sound strange but keep in mind that anxiety is at play here. I also have a history of being anxious about “turning gay” despite that being impossible. I also want to note that I do actively support the LGBT+ community, meaning I am an active straight ally and I do support them through protests and other forms of activism.

Anyway just last night I imagined it all happening again and it was awful. I felt it all happening. It’s almost like the effects came back. I kept feeling like I hypnotized myself and placed worse affects. I started looking up porn and masturbating constantly. Eventually I found “emmology” femdom porn on tumblr which is apparently Emma Watson femdom porn that’s supposed to be structured like some sort of religion where Emma Watson is worshiped. Pretty freaky stuff. But it seems forced gay themed it said something like “Say sorry to Emma for jerking and cumming to her and other women”. All of a sudden I felt those words go into my subconscious and now I’m no longer attracted to girls. I felt more too but I can’t exactly describe it. I felt I was in a hypnotic state while masturbating. Then I imagined giving myself a hypnotic trigger, “feet”, that’d make me attracted to male feet for 30 minutes. I’ve always had a kink for female feet and now I’m just having a hard time. I’ve never felt more awful. I feel 0 attraction to girls, my GAD is acting up and I don’t know what to do with myself.

I share with the world what I want to share, and the rest-the rest is all for me. No one gets to know me in that way. Because once I share myself with you, I expect you to give a fuck. I expect you to give a lot of fucks. And I know that no one will be able to care for me the way I need them to. So some things are just best if left unsaid. ",11Nov2018,2
107,"I've always been more or less a happy, content guy (M21). Life at uni is not what I thought it would be, because of a lack of effort on my behalf. I don't feel sad, but for the past couple weeks I havent done any work, just gone on the computer and I went gym 3 or 4 times. Here is a journal entry I made today cos I'm annoyed that I am feeling/being this way.

""I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I think. Or maybe I just haven't thought about it clearly enough. I don't want to take action in the things that I know I should be doing. Things are pretty good when I think about it, everyones healthy, I live well, my course isn't too bad. There's a lot I'm grateful for, but I refuse to do any work. I dont even know. I feel shit. Sometimes I snap out of it for a while, then I doubt my good feelings because I am thinking that maybe I am just convincing myself to ignore my issues and feel happy. i am confused. It's like I know what to do to stop myself feeling so 'depressed' (if thats even the word), but i wont do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have hit bouts of laziness before and I usually rode the wave and stopped it when i got sick of myself, but now its like I'm trying to resist it, but its not working. It's just making me feel guilty. When i try to conceptualise how to get out of it, I think again, am I just trying to decieve myself. Is this what jordan peterson spoke about, pathologising my thinking with lies? 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok. All of this is the truth. The truth is also that i am not doing enough. I will find myself in a difficult scenario if I dont work. I will feel less immobilised and freer if I take meaningful action.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I think I should do and how do I think I should act? I think I should do my work. I think that I should stop being so self-critical and more self-compassionate even if I am lazy for eternity Because I have to spend time with myself, I should at least be kind to myself. Kind, but objective is how i think I should be. I should distance myself from 'how' I feel, whether it be good or bad, and focus on the actions that I must take that will create a life that has the least suffering and is most meaningful.  The problem with that is I don't know what I find meaningful. This engineering degree will yield me many benefits, but am I doing it solely because it is expedient, and not intrinsically meaningful to me? I think so. My next task should be to clearly define what i find intrinsically meaningful, then.""

I desperately want to rid myself of this existential dread. It's begun to impact my life in other areas, and that's making things worse. 

I constantly see reminders of how quickly time passes. For example, I just saw that it's been almost twenty years since the Matrix was released. Twenty years!

114,"Hi everyone. So I'm feeling lost, frustrated, and sad and don't know what to do. This is going to be a long post so I appreciate it if you read through but understand if you don't.

I suppose to start I should introduce myself. You can call me Vex, and I am a bit of a lurker on this sub. I've been struggling with mental health issues for years and it's coming to a head now.

I am a fifth year student at a four year university and I feel stuck. In high school I started to recognize the impact my mental health was having on my life. However, I wasn't able to do anything until about my junior or senior year of college. My parents were sometimes supportive and sometimes not so it took some time before they finally were convinced I was sick enough to go to a therapist.

I have been seeing my therapist, who I will call LN, for over a year now. After about two months of working with him, we mutually decided I needed to be on medication and my general practitioner prescribed me Lexapro. I started off with a 10 mg dose and a few months later went up to and held at 15 mg. I stayed in therapy the whole time and remained in therapy for about a year. I saw a considerable amount of improvement by the beginning of 2018 and ended up tapering off my appointments with LN until I stopped seeing him around late July. This was somewhat of an accident (scheduling conflicts, etc.) but LN had told me from the beginning that he wanted to get me to a point where seeing him would be ""obsolete"" (more or less). I am still taking those 15 mg of Lexapro once a day and remain responsible about taking the medication.

Over the course of the summer I had some of the worst times of my life. I got in my first car accident, lost my childhood dog, got in my first major fight with my SO, fell down the stairs and injured myself, and had a frustrating and draining job which included a noticeable amount of overtime and physical labor (among other things). Despite all of this, I felt like my mental health was in a great place.

The therapy and medication seemed to be working and I learned how to address these difficult times in a healthy and productive way. 

Enter school.

Like I mentioned, I'm a fifth year student. This is due to in no small part my associations with school. School and by extension schoolwork has been a major trigger for me for years. I used to have major fights with my parents over my school performance and I think that has something to do with why I have such a terrible association with it. Regardless, school has never been something that I like doing or feel comfortable with. I am relatively intelligent and fully capable of getting good grades, but over the course of time my grades have taken a nose dive. I went from having well over a 3.0 to just over a 2.0 and regularly fail classes.

Usually my semester starts out fine enough. I show up to class, meet expectations, and get decent grades. For the last three or four semesters, something has changed. The semester starts out the same but instead of powering through despite my frustration, I become stuck and depressed. Difficult thoughts progress and I stop attending classes and submitting assignments on time. Eventually, I beg my professors for grace and either get it or don't. If I do get it, then I usually pull out something of a miracle and land somewhere in the C to B range, but if they don't give me special permissions I end up failing.

I have switched into the Communications major from my old major and thought that would make a difference. A more straight forward and guided path; just what I needed! But the pattern persists. I'm back to the same old same old and am scared I'm going to drop below a 2.0 and therefore am not going to be able to graduate at all. I've spent a large amount of time and money on classes yet here I am again unable to motivate myself and bring myself to complete the semester. I have no idea if my professors are going to show me grace and there's a fairly good chance that I'm going to have to go even LONGER in college.

What I'm currently doing is unsustainable. I don't understand why I can't make myself finish college. I am soooo close to graduating at this point. If I would have done what I was supposed to do this semester I could have graduated next semester.

And I think the most frustrating part of all of this is that I don't understand what's happening. I am a hard worker, and am FREQUENTLY complimented on my work ethic in jobs. So why don't I have that same tenacity in college?

So here's where I'm at. I'm mortified by my inability to complete college and am terrified of the social judgement I'm going to face. I just want to be done. But at the same time I KNOW I can't get a decent job now-a-days without having a college degree. But I can't complete college and feel doomed to repeat this same thing over and over and over. What am I supposed to do? Do I drop out of college here at the end, find some job that doesn't terribly mind I don't have a college degree, and move on with my life? Or do I try recognize I'm only going to GET a job I want if I have a degree? Do I push through and let my mental health suffer? What can I do to make sure I don't do this again next semester? I will say I have set up an appointment with my therapist for ASAP (on a wait list for cancellations, have an appointment scheduled for a week from tomorrow). My parents want me to move back home with them where they can help me more actively, but I'm 22 and have established relationships which will suffer if I do that.

TL;DR

I'm a college student in his fifth year who is triggered by school/schoolwork/social judgement. Do I push through the pain and try to graduate ASAP or do I take a leave of absence and take a different path in life (at least for the foreseeable future)?

118,"Hey everyone so I've already set up an appointment with my school counselor to find a long term therapist so hopefully that will help me a lot! I've never been to therapy so I'm not diagnosed with anything as of yet. 

Around the winter months I tend to become very unmotivated and I stop taking care of myself mentally and physically. However I've already been going through a long period (about a year and a half) of not taking care of myself physically. I had an injury that made it hard for me to go to the gym and now I'm having a hard time moving past that even though I'm fully capable of going to the gym again. I'm also not taking care of my hygiene as much, I won't want to get out of bed to brush my teeth, or shower. I've also been slacking on studying and it's really getting me down. 

I'm upset with how I look now versus a couple of year ago, and I'm upset that I'm not working as hard with my studies as I need to be. 

I'm ordering some journaling stuff so I can start keeping track of my emotions, stuff I have to do, how often I exercise etc. because I think it would help me if I saw everything written down. I'm just worried that I'll lose the motivation to do this as well. I really just want to feel like myself again.

119,"Before you read on if your looking for a short one it's not I'm sorry.

I want to start off by saying my life isn't a bad one, it's not great but I know I could have it alot worse. To everyone around me I try to be a smiling happy, 'just relax' person, someone I have always strived to be, someone to inspire others or just be helpful, but sadly I'm a ""do as I say not as I do"" case, inside all I feel is empty and hatred. I hate myself, I hate everything about me, I honestly want to die but am too scared to actually pull the trigger and I suppose this is the only help I want to get, by using a burn account talking to randoms on the internet. I have tried to ""just be happy"", have taken anti-depressants but none of them seem to work after taking them for long periods of time, what's the point in buying something if it doesn't help.

I want to be happy, I want to be the person everyone thinks I am, but I'm not, I'm lost in my own head with seemingly no way out and that only makes me feel worse. I don't think that life is one I can have so if I could I'd rather just walk through life fucked up on drugs, numb to the world but still living, what everybody but me wants, a middle of the road in a way. I refuse to talk to anyone close to me about how I feel because the few times I have I just get dismissed and told to do [Insert Thing Here] and I'll be all better. I have tried...same result.

Let's say I do though and they won't do that to me, I refuse to put myself in such a vulnerable position, one where someone can completely destroy me (or what's left of ""me"") so easily with whatever I confide in them. I'm too cautious of what I have left to do so, and for the ""Oh go see a psychologist"" people. No. I refuse to believe even a single fucking word of someone who gets paid to listen to problems, if they give me the right one or not it doesn't fucking matter they get paid ether way so why should I believe some random ""professional"" would help me when they don't know anything about me, don't have some personal connection to me, and get paid to say whatever ""professional opinion"" they have and have me believe them.

I'm lost I don't see anyway that I can be happy and would rather null the pain with pills (no I'm not messed up on drugs, currently or ever) or end my own life so I won't ever have to deal with it again, everyone wants me alive, but what's the point in living if you can't enjoy it.

I don't know if anyone feels exactly the way I do with what I have put out there, but I figure I'd put this swan song out here before I do something that I know will hurt other's, but will give me the release I want. I don't trust anyone's opinion here, I will listen though, it's my last chance. I figure that since nobody is getting paid to read this, nor is getting paid to comment anything that I at least trust your opinion more (and will hear it out completely) than I would someone close to me who can hurt me, or someone who get's paid to give people answers, be they right or wrong in the end.

To anyone who might feel what I feel or even something close to it, at least ask for help in some form before you make your potential final decision, even if it is opening yourself up on a burn account for randoms on the internet to help or mock. Thank you for you time. ",11Nov2018,1

124,"Sorry for the novel. I really hope you read it though because i'm losing hope.

After a mental breakdown last November, and my emotionally abusive mother taking over in my vulnerable state to use me as a pawn against my father and sisters who I lived with at the time, I moved out and lived with my mom for 7 months. I was pretty much cut off from my family and friends. I couldn’t do anything. My agoraphobia was triggered from intense anxiety and the fact that I lived 7 floors up in a apartment I hated, made it harder. My dad offered to take me out but the guilt of “what if I have to turn around and go back home due to anxiety and I made him drive all this way?” Prevented me from even trying. My mother made me feel guilty for wanting to spend time with him. She told me he wasn’t allowed to come up to the apartment because “he’s got bad vibes.” “He’s a terrible person.” “I don’t want him in my house.” I cried straight for 7 months. I slept my days away to avoid everything. Friends, family, everything. Panic attacks every day. Every time I heard that door handle, cue anxiety. My mother would tell me I was ungrateful because her other daughters wouldn’t come visit her. She made all her problems mine. I couldn’t force my sister to do anything. They didn’t want to see my mother. My grandfather would come over and Id hear him and my mother saying “why is she sleeping?” “Oh thats all she does.” I lost what ever self esteem I had left. I would get screamed at for not spending time with her and staying in my room. If the dishes weren’t done on her time. If the garbage wasn’t taken out on her time even when it wasn’t full. I did these things when she was at work and I wasn’t being pushed to do so. Wasn’t enough for her. I got groceries online for myself  and she called me selfish. I wanted to go back to my dads in May but she guilted me and called me ungrateful and her dad came over and stood in my doorway telling me I should be disabled, I have no friends, no life. My mom stood there and didn’t say anything to defend me. If I wanted to talk to her about how I was feeling, she invalidated everything. I tried to tell her I was stressed or tired, only go get “YOU THINK IM NOT STRESSED OR TIRED?! It’s not all about you.” At the end. I shut down. I stopped opening up about my feelings. I tried to avoid my mother at all costs. I would try to get out and take walks or spend time at the gym in the building only for my mother to once again, freak out on me about some problem of hers and then I would end up defeated and not wanting to do anything. I never had any privacy. The apartment felt like a prison. I would get breaks to take a bath and relax but I was always anxious I was taking too long and my mother would bitch that she needed to shower. She would sometimes just come in because she needed to go to the bathroom and while doing that sh’e bitch about her day or. How my dad and sisters don’t talk to her anymore. At that point I shut all my feeling off. To everyone. Even myself. The last straw was in July when my mother was standing in my doorway yelling about my sisters and how the don’t talk to her and treat her like shit, how my dad is a heartless human being, her life and her problems and I cut myself. I just like blacked out and did it. I wasn’t even thinking. I went into the bathroom and cried. I let my dad down who I promised I wouldn’t do it again. My dad is a saint who played mom AND dad my whole life. My mom came in demanding to use the bathroom and saw me and was mad. She was mad cause it hurts her. She grabbed me and demanded to clean me up. I didn’t want her too. She would throw in back in my face like everything she does. I just shut down and let her. She bandaged me up then went to hug me. I didn’t let her. I knew when we got in a argument she would use it..”WHO BANDAGED YOU AFTER YOU CUT YOURSELF!” I went in my bedroom and she sat next to me. She said “did you tell your dad?” I said no. She said “Okay good. Let’s keep it between us.” Yeah mom so you can get the attention again. She loves for people to feel sorry for her. Well after that, I told my dad I needed out. He told me he agreed. I moved back home where I never should have left, in July. My mom of course made me feel like shit, using her dad as backup. That she was there for me and I’m ungrateful leaving her in the dust. She guilted me about living with my dad and how he’s a piece of shit. She made it hard. I’ve been here for almost 4 months. I’m still getting adjusted. I had to adjust to a roommate my dad had to get to keep affording this place after I left and my sister followed suit. My one sister moved back and that made it feel a little like home again. I’m still stuck on apartment mode. That’s what I call it. My routine in the apartment was sleep all day. No point in getting up. I don’t do anything and can’t do anything. I do that still. It’s like my brain has established a routine. I wake up and it’s like I don’t know that I can now just walk out the front door and go wherever Like. I can go out with my dad and sister. I can socialized. My agoraphobia is still there but its still like I’m trapped even though I’m not. I don’t understand. I feel like I’m fucking broken. I can’t break through this routine I did for 8 months. I mean I have done some stuff. I have left a few times. I took walks in the summer, I went to the store  twice. But it feel weird when I do. I don’t know how to describe it. I hear my mothers words all the time. Im constantly justifying every move I make so I don’t piss anyone off even though my dad is nothing like my mom. I have it in my head that everyone hates me and i'm a waste of space. I’m on disability and don’t work so my days don’t have much of a routine but this is awful. I could be doing thing.

We’ve been doing some great work together and now he’s leaving for another city. I’m female and I’m gay. I am confused by my feelings and I feel like reading about transference doesn’t really equal my thoughts or feelings towards my therapist. I’ve never been with a man and I’ve never felt attractive to any man before. I have two sessions left with him before he leaves. I’m attractive (which is the first word people around me describe me as, which to me seems very shallow), well trained, well dressed, well educated, feminine and I’m 31 years old. I am describing myself so that any reader won’t picture a bald fat lesbian (because unfortunately that’s often how people expect “us” to look like - not that in any way that is a bad look). 

When I think of him being right next to me, holding me, me touching his skin and him touching my skin I feel the same warmth in my body as I would have falling in love.

I also want to hold him and be there for him, get to know him and give him all the “love” he has given me. I see him every week and I always count the days for the next session. I’ve never told him about my feelings towards him. 

Should I tell him now that we’re done working together?
Should I shut up and possibly regret never confessing my feelings? 
I don’t really have any expectations for his answer. 
He is a little older than me and VERY kind - so whatever he responds I’m sure he won’t be too mean. 

Please help. ",11Nov2018,1
131,"I’ve had a pretty good day today. I haven’t gotten a lot done, but nothing bad has really happened. I shouldn’t feel this low right now. I don’t have any motivation. Yesterday I was very motivated, and got many of the tasks I had planned to complete, completed. 

What is wrong with me? For some context, I’m a 13 year old male. Is this just a normal mood swing, or is this something “bigger?” I feel like To happens every few days, but I don’t want to jump to conclusions. What should I tell my parents? 

Thanks and good day!",11Nov2018,1

133,"My illness began as me compulsively checking my food for unfamiliar contaminants or substances from a young age. Or choosing not to eat certain food given to me due to the fear of dying painfully and suddenly from food poisoning. I was diagnosed with OCD since the age of 15 but was never medicated for it. I am in my 20s now. 

As of a few months ago the contaminant I began fearing made the irrational fear rational to me. And I lost 15 pounds in a few recent weeks, and am suffering from minor dehydration. 

The contaminant in question is fetanyl or cartenyl. [You cannot see the lethal dose](https://i.redd.it/raivi2rx7pr01.jpg). Found almost everywhere in large quantities. Every week new stashes are found that could [kill millions of people in dose amounts.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/25/inside-a-semi-truck-in-nebraska-troopers-found-enough-fentanyl-to-kill-26-million-people/) And what triggered this fear was learning that in 30% of all overdose cases the injection site isn't found so it could have came in any way. Leading me to believe **thousands of non addicts are dying due to leaks of the substance**. I've known people who overdosed who no one suspected was a drug addict. For all we know it reached our watershed or food supply. 

As of 2 months ago I started seeing a specialist who specializes in OCD cases. He believes at a very early age my subconscious started making unhealthy associations between food and death. And since CBT has failed between me and 2 other professionals we need to dig deep and uncover this fear. However consciously I don't want his help anymore. This fear is real to me and for all I know I could be a victim and die of what I feared all my life with any amount of therapeutic treatment..

I don't know what to do. My mind legitimately believes this fear is rational and no one including professionals know the real truth...",11Nov2018,1
134,"Just to preface this, I have started to talk to a mental health professional recently.

When I was in seventh grade, I got into this bad habit of watching movies and videos before sleep, even though I knew I wasn't supposed to, and my younger sister picked it up. She got caught by my mother and was punished. I felt guilty because I had done it first and for longer so I confessed to my mother and received the same punishment. But from that point forward I had to confess everything, or else I would be filled with completely overwhelming guilt. Every hour of my day was full of thoughts of all of the mean things I had said, or things I had done that I wasn't supposed to, and every night I had to confess all of them to my mother. Afterwards, I would feel fine, but the thoughts would soon return and I had trouble sleeping because they would continually pop into my head. I would have to wake up and write them down to confess in the morning. This horrible cycle went on for a few months and I didn't talk to a mental health professional or really anyone outside of my mother about it. Eventually, for a reason, I don't understand I managed to shake the need to confess. What made all of this even more horrible, was that I knew the things I was so guilty about were completely irrational. I had to confess if I didn't take the smaller half of a cookie, or if I poured myself a fuller glass of milk. I had to confess if I thought something mean or hurtful, even if I hadn't done what I had thought. 

 I don't have to do this anymore, but I am filled with questions about what happened to me 5 years ago. I think that whatever happened to me then still affects me now. I feel as if I live inside of a box in my own head, and have to act in a specific way. I don't allow myself to swear, and when I am in situations where I am socially expected to I feel overwhelmingly stressed, like when we are reading aloud in class and the passage has swear words. I am not allowed to lie and have to think my answers through carefully so I don't hurt any feelings while also not telling a lie. I also become stressed whenever my friends want to break a rule, even if it isn't a very large one. Of course, they don't understand why I don't do these things and it can make things awkward. The other problem is I don't know who I am if I don't act this way and so don't want to try and break these self-imposed rules. 

I appreciate you reading my story, and would be grateful for any advice or if you have experienced something similar.",11Nov2018,1

136,"Yesterday I was at dinner and told my family how I try to sit at the end of the row in lecture halls (I'm in college) because I don't like to sit in-between people. I told them that one time I did sit in between people and suddenly felt stuck and felt my sandals (which were very loose) sudden become tighter like they were suffocating my foot. I felt uncomfortable but had dealt with that issue before so I just tried to focus on the lecture calm myself down. By my family's reaction, I could clearly see this was not normal and I sensed they thought it was weird.  I don't have a problem with elevators and am pretty okay with small spaces, it's just with people's touch. I have a boyfriend and if he lays his leg on top of mine, I immediately have to remove myself and let him know I felt like I was being squished. I don't know if this would be considered Claustrophobia or if this is something more. ",11Nov2018,1
137,"I’m constantly thinking. Usually about my emotions, or events that cause me to be emotional in some way, whether it be happy or sad etc. So, people who either lack emotions or have spent time with people who do, what are your thoughts throughout the day? Do you just think about events without an emotional reaction?",11Nov2018,1
138,"I was doing pretty decent on my meds until I started staying up too late and messed up my schedule, for about five days. But I've been back on schedule for 3-4 weeks now, and I felt decent after getting back on schedule, but I've been declining since then. I've tried everything, vitamin b complex, multivitamins, vitamin d3, SAM-e, Klonopin, caffeine, eating healthy things like tuna, eating and drinking even when I don't want to. I felt bad before I took this stuff, so it can't be what I'm taking. It just doesn't help. I just want to get to at least a decent level, even if I can't enjoy things (I've had anhedonia most of the time for 5 years now) Why is this happening and how do I fix it?",11Nov2018,1
