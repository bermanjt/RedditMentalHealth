0,Not sure if his is the place to be. If not if one of you could point me in the right direction. I have pre menstrual dysphoria as well as other mental health issues. In my past I have been at rock bottom but it seems no mater how well I’m doing the week before my period o become somebody else. It’s almost like I’m on the outside watching myself. I still haven’t found an anti depressant that works for me and sometimes it’s a struggle but I’m able to manage it for the most part now EXCEPT that week before my period. I just went back on birth control to see if that helps but would love to hear other experiences. ,18Jul2018,1

2,"My girlfriend has recently been suffering from some pretty severe anxiety and depression, a lot of it stemming from school. I'm going to be moving for grad school and I'm extremely worried about her. It's getting so bad that if one small thing goes wrong in a class she'll just leave. I have no idea how to help and when she's calmed down enough to consider talking to someone (ie therapist) she doesn't go through with it and when she's stressed out she won't even talk about it.

5,"I am just here to vent and ask a question for a second. Vent to the world. I feel as though today I have been torn into a million pieces. My history is messed up. I have PTSD when it comes to certain medical procedures because I almost died. That being said, I have to have a certain procedure done tomorrow that has been triggering me and sending my anxiety to an all one high. I asked my mother to come with me to help since my friends and fiancé is out of town. To be fair, my mother lives 4 hours away. She did agree though, and I was so comforted. But she just called me to say she will not be coming. She did not give me a reason besides she did not feel comfortable driving so far. 
So this is the thing. My parents have always been flaky. They have left me for days to take care of 2 infants (my brothers) when I was just 9. I had to help ease my dying great grandmother into that transition when they lost their money to drugs and alcohol and we had to move I. With her at age 11. Needless to say the drug and alcohol use caused many issues, but most for me is attachment. I constantly fear that I will be left alone like I was when I was 9. I guess my nervousness about this procedure tomorrow has caused my attachment issue get worse. Now that she cannot come, I feel lost, depressed, and so full of hurt and anger. I am mostly mad at myself for falling back into this attachment issue. They have always been flaky, so I shouldn’t be surprised that she cancelled, but it hurts. I have never felt so alone. My question is, how do others deal with this attachment issue? I go to a therapist, I have been put on medication for my PTSD and Anxiety Disorder. But, essentially, how to I help myself overcome this feeling of hopelessness when I am alone and begin to fall back in? 
TLDR: Procedure tomorrow has me falling back into my attachment issue since my mother flaked on me. How do I stop this regression?",18Jul2018,1

7,"I know I should just accept it because it's natural, but whenever I get..... u know... the feeling (I'm 20-something, f)... I really hate myself. I get mad that it's there. 

For the past few days I've been having ""the feeling"" pretty often and idk y. I'm single and don't get out often, so it's not like there's anything prompting it, besides that I haven't been ""active"" in .... I don't know since maybe May of this year? So really not a long time. My drive is really low normally. 

Whenever I get the feeling, I want it to go away and I want to maim it so I can't feel it anymore, I even bought cream to numb it but that didn't work. If I act on it, then I hate myself even more afterwards and feel so guilty and ashamed and dirty/unclean and low and mad and like I don't deserve to be treated nicely because I'm just a disgusting whore. I've never had like a one night stand or anything like that but I see myself as such a slut when I act on the feeling. Sometimes, when I'm not in a good head space and having these feelings I get these impulsive thoughts to go just like hook up with a guy or go to a sex chatroom or whatever or even become a stripper or such. I haven't acted on those, but similar thoughts in the past have gotten me in trouble. I just need to control the thoughts and the feeling, but it's making me so... anxious and scared. Yesterday, because of these feelings, I curled up in my closet with my weighted blanket and had a panic attack and one of my seizure-like episodes because I was so ... idk... I was so something that it caused me to freak out .

I know my history of ptsd from being assaulted is probably a factor and maybe being raised Roman catholic, but I really really want to not feel it. 

I've tried seeing therapists about the PTSD but I have panic attacks and seizure-like episodes when I have high negative emotions so I can't even cross the line into processing it. ",18Jul2018,1
8,"About every month or so I experience very intense feelings of dread, panic, sadness, and loneliness. Usually these little bouts last several hours and it feels like my chest is pounding, I’m in physical pain, and I have intense suicidal and self harming urges. I am irrationally convinced no one cares for me and I usually end up rocking back and forth in a corner or sobbing uncontrollably for several hours. This has happened since I was a child. It’s very all encompassing and overwhelming. It feels like nothing is right with the world and it will never get better. I sometimes feel better in the morning after I’ve slept it off but usually not ever before then. What are these? It seems like they’re different from panic attacks. I sometimes forget I have them until they randomly happen again. Usually they are paired with sustained periods of stress in my life and perhaps PMS week, but I can’t really remember if those things are always linked. I have self harmed and taken pills in the past with these bouts. I am currently crying in the bathroom at work. If this hits home with anybody please let me know what it may be. ",18Jul2018,6
9,"I don't get it. I barely scrape into ""moderate"" drinking at the most stressful of times and make a point of having days where I don't drink, and make a point of never having more than two drinks in one day. I don't get anxiety-attacks at some set point after my last drink either.

It's a gradual increase in anxiety, irrationality, insociability, and a general decline in functional cognitive power. It tends to peak at something that resembles ADHD+Anxiety which quickly wears me down.

6 months of sobriety didn't do anything but torture me until my anxiety was so bad I could barely go to work.

Its only certain people I'm anxious around and some of them I'm friends with. I can have conversations and fun around them but I'm anxious if they come to close to me like I gotta be a little bit away from them. 

I can cope with it but its kinda feels strange and very not like myself at all. I have all kinds of fears like id get a disease, I'd die or something bad would happen to me. 

It's not with everyone I get this. It's only certain people I get this with. I just feel uncomfortable when I know I should be. 

I don't have paranoid feeling at home or with my family or with think people are tryna kill me or anything like that. I just feel like I'm slightly anxious because of what happened in the past. 

I don't have any mental illness I don't think. I am able to study focus and concentrate well, I eat healthy etc. I just have trauma or panic which comes to me. Ive had a few panic attacks since it happened and I just feel rubbish because I was never like this.

Nothing is ever proven scientifically and accepted by the majority of the mental health care community, accept for a few genetically influenced/based diseases like schitzophrenia. That is why no one ever gets better.  Unless you take responsibility for your own (mental) health and try to figure these things out for yourself, which I invite everyone reading this post to do, you will probably suffer for decades if not for the rest of your life.  You can play it safe and be fucked-up for the rest of your life or you can try to start thinking for yourselves and risk the possibility of getting better.                 

This does **not** mean that you should stop seeing your mental health care provider or that you should stop taking your meds.  You will be in a better position to make those kinds of decisions if and when you get better.  You are perfectly capable to seeing results when results are actually there and not seeing results when results are not actually there.
                  
Most mental illness is the result of inflammation. **ALL** mental illness is aggrevated by inflammation.  Not everyone's inflammation results in nerve inflammation, but it did for me and for many other people. The number one way that I know to reduce inflammation is to change one's diet thusly:

Cut out 100% of all refined foods, particularly refined carbs and sugar. (reddit.com/r/keto/)

Intermittent and extended fasting. (https://www.allaboutfasting.com/ , https://zerocarbzen.com/dry-fasting/)

Ketogenic, paleo, and/or carnivorous eating. (The FAQs at reddit.com/r/keto/, reddit.com/r/Paleo/, and reddit.com/r/zerocarb/)

There are many other ways to reduce inflammation, but from my experience of 50 years of struggling with mental illness (and **winning**) these are the most important. It is all about an inflammatory diet. Unless a person gets serious about eating an anti-inflammatory diet, I don't see things getting better for that person. It didn't for me.           

When I started seeing signs of type 2 diabetes, I decided that I better do something about it. I had no clue that a side benefit would be better emotional control and resilience, less irritability, and basically just having better mental health. My family is happier since I have discovered this. Don't set this aside for 45 years like I did. I knew about the benefits of fasting 45 years ago and just ignored it because I didn't want to give up my *culinary pleasures*.  Think outside of the box and know that I have nothing to gain from telling you this.           

Of course the fasting suggestion is only for people who **do not have** anorexia type of mental problems.           

It is not in the financial interests of talk therapists that you get well quickly.  What a coincident that you will never hear about the mental health benefits of diet and fasting from talk therapists.  In fact, from the viewpoint of talk therapists, the very best therapy is the one that takes a really long time.

I have a pretty great life yet I take numerous amount of things for granted. My parents, my talents and of course the technology that’s accessible to me. I’m an only child and have become pretty spoiled among my parents, but I try not to be too much of a hassle. Beyond all of this, I still yearn for more at low points in my life. Low points in my life that might seem like the highest and most grand to someone else. It’s hard not to take everything for granted. 
 
  
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
 
  
 
 
I guess what I’m trying to say is look at us. We have so much to live for. It’s not my place at all to assume what struggles you may be going through, and I apologize for anything you might be currently. But I do know that if you’re reading this, you have some sort of access to the internet. Holy shit. The internet. We can now talk to people who may live either a mile away or a thousand miles for the same cost. This is outstanding stuff and without it this subreddit (along with the name ‘subreddit’) would be nonexistent.  
 
  
  
Y’know, every now and then we just have to take a moment to inhale the stuff around us. The stuff that doesn’t matter, but when you think about it, hey, maybe it really does matter and benefits you greatly. Things suck, but we’re breathing, maybe there’s an abyss of negatives, but look at the positives for once, it changes everything. 

 
 
  
&amp;nbsp;
 
 
 
 

So please, let’s be thankful for what we have. Our low points might be someone’s dream and therefore we have to cherish everything we have. We are beautiful people. You’re amazing and one of a kind. Try one more new thing everyday, you’d be surprised where you end up. Lastly, please keep your head up and believe in yourself and have some pride, because in life, that’s all that matters. That’s all that we really live for. I’m right here with you. ",18Jul2018,4

1) Just got out of an 8-year relationship. 

2) She left because I wasn't ready for a relationship in the first place and it took us way too long to realise it. 

3) I've been chronically unemployed for years, am depressed and anxious, lack drive and discipline, dropped out of university (twice), took the relationship for granted, promised to change multiple times and failed, have basically 0 social life, etc.

4) I've been trying to enact positive change in my life. Kind of. I volunteer a an animal shelter. I try to get out and talk to people daily even though it's extremely uncomfortable and scary. I went to the gym once last month. I'm going back to school to be a vet nurse.

5) I've become an alcoholic. It reduces anxiety, so I use it as a social performance enhancer.

6) I went to therapy (psychodynamic) for a while, but it was expensive and I didn't really notice the benefits until 6 months after I stopped going and my ex pointed out how, with therapy, I had ""opened up"" and ""improved"". But by then it was too late; my therapist had retired.

7) Thinking of going back to therapy. CBT, this time. The psychodynamic approach feels frustrating, boring, difficult and wishy-washy in the moment. Progress is slow, unpredictable, hard to gauge and only apparent in retrospect.

8) feel the urge to seek out female companionship and I'm not sure whether it's a healthy desire or just driven by desperation. 

I frequent a bar where a cute bartender has been showing me attention, giving me (increasing) discounts, calling me affectionate names, and sticking around to talk to me while touching her hair a lot. I genuinely enjoy talking to her, and I'd like to get to know her better. I'm reasonably positive that she'd agree to go out.

HOWEVER... 

I'm not in a healthy place in my life right now. I'm in the middle of moving into my own place, my ex and I are still sharing custody of our dog, and I still haven't solved any of the personal problems that ruined that relationship in the first place.

THEN AGAIN...

What's the harm in making a connection with someone whose company you enjoy? It doesn't have to become ""serious"".

But then it suddenly became this cycle that I couldn’t break... even the slightest thing would’ve made me upset... and to make things worse the distance got to us. We broke up a few times because of that kind of “behavior” but after being apart for a while we always decide to get back together. 

Fast forward to something that recently happen. I have to admit I am also a jealous type and two different group of friends has already visited him, one last year and another one currently still there. I get jealous because I want it to be me but unfortunately the circumstances does not allow us to meet so soon which makes it very difficult for me and hard to accept. 

I have tried to be optimistic and happy for him while his friend is there. Though I have to admit I get upset when he stays out late. So recently I asked if he could  save this activity for us to do tgt for the first time instead of going with his friend. After much disagreement and pleading, he agreed and decided to wait for me to do it together. However I found out that he lied and actually went to do it without me. I got really upset and raged at him for lying to me. I felt really hurt because if I felt that if he cared about me he would keep to his word and not do it secretly behind my back. So this time our argument got really bad. He said that I promised to change back in the day but ever since then I am still the same person and it’s probably stuck in my DNA. He assumes that all I care about is my own happiness. 

In my defense, I felt that it is not the case. Because ever since his friend was there I did not stop him from going to all the places and eating all the good food. Yes I did get upset at times and I felt terribly bad. After much thinking I don’t think it’s true that I did not care about his happiness because I only asked for just this one thing he could do with me. And if he was concern about me he should have kept to his word and not lie and do it behind my back. 

After which,  he went to look up the kind of behavior I was exhibiting and he showed me a post about histrionic personality disorder. When I gave it a read, it kind of sounded like how I was behaving. It may be worse actually because I feel a lot more than what the article said. At first he said that it’s probably incurable and he won’t be able to stand me if I don’t get my shit together. I’m really afraid of losing him and I want to change and be better but I don’t know where to start. Controlling my emotions sounds easier than done and I keep failing at doing that. I really don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: Had a major argument with my boyfriend, he thinks that I have histrionic personality disorder. I need some way to get help but I have no money to go for therapy/counseling. I really want to change and be a better partner but I don’t know how. ",18Jul2018,1

just wondering if anyone knows whether it's possible or even has experience with medicating depression and adhd at the same time? While being in therapy, I have been medicating my depression with cipralex 10mg / day for the past year but my adhd has gotten so much worse since then and now I am thinking about what to do about it.

She’s currently in a relationship and she tells me her mental health is affecting it. I know she has depression for sure but I don’t know after this situation she told me about. The other day she told me she got into a heated argument with her s.o and she ended up having an anxiety attack but not only that she got frustrated and ended up hurting herself. During the argument she started to punch herself in the face. And she said she pulled some of her hair out. I’m worried about her idk what’s going on honestly.

On the first day, my psychologist brought up bipolar. Since then he's mentioned it 5 or so times, including today, when I said I was scared for my diagnosis by a psychiatrist, to which he said, ""try not to worry, bipolar is manageable, and with the right treatment you will be able to function  normally"".

My diagnosis by psychiatrist isn't still for roughly a month, since it takes so long to get in, but I'm wondering if I should be taking to heart what my psychologist says about bipolar. We haven't talked outright about it, and I never would have picked it by looking at myself.

43,"I've always been someone who dwelled and let things get to him. Six months ago I decided to move to another country and cut off ties with a lot of people in my life (including more minimal contact with my family), but I've found that old adage from The Wire holds true: ""Wherever you go, there you are.""

In my case, I think of past insults. Past times I was taken advantage of. Past times I was rebuffed by others. Times I tried to improve my life and it didn't work out, or times I tried to connect or mend bridges with others — and it didn't work out. It colors my attitude here in situations where it shouldn't, and I'm unable to stop thinking about it even though I'm thousands of miles away. The only downtime I get is where I'm truly absorbed in something new, but that can't happen every single second of the day. So I'm left feeling like I'm constantly running away, emotionally speaking.

I've met new people, seen exotic places, had radically different experiences, read good novels, lifted weights. I've even abandoned my social media accounts and severely limited my contact with friends and family I used to know.

It helps, but it doesn't actually change what's inside you. 

I'm happy for the decision I made; without it, there are several amazing experiences I wouldn't have had. But hopping across the ocean also allows you the chance to see what's external, and what's internal. And more is inside me than what I expected.

I take natural supplements instead.

As for the medications, the reasons for rejection are: Fear of negative alteration to both brain and body, and the fact that I took medications when I was a teen for 4 years without professional supervision and I fear it has ruined me. Also, I do not think the long-term concerns about the temporary usages of medications is even worth it. I would rather live the truth, rather than indose myself with a feeling which is a lie.

46,"Hi,
So I’m in my early twenties, female, and suffering from depression for years. I’ve never been a joyful/happy kid. My childhood was shitty. My teenage years were as well.
I’m better now, I mean I don’t have to wake up in the morning and go to school and talk to people I hate or whatever. I basically sit there doing nothing all day long. I hate it but I don’t hate it as much.

I’m lucky I have friends, I’ve never been in a relationship though.

I’m lowkey addicted to alcohol and meds. I mean, for meds I have an excuse, I am mentally ill. But I tend to drink too much. Almost everyday. That doesn’t help for sure.

I have no dreams, no will to do anything. I’m basically satisfied with myself if I have gone through the day without causing myself severe harm. If someone asked me what do you want to be when you « grow up » (or old... lol) I wouldn’t be able to answer.

My favorite part of the day is going to bed. I often have nightmares but it’s still better than being awake and in a real life nightmare.

I don’t know how to get better, I feel like it’s impossible. I’m lost, I feel like I don’t belong here and I don’t know what to do.

I’m already seeing professionals, already taking medication. That just helps me standing the fact of existing. I’ve got enough of this situation. It’s been this way for years. I can’t stand it anymore, I’m wasting my youth. Where should I start ? What can I do to stop this illness from destroying me ? I mean I know life is not and will never be beautiful for anyone and I’ll never be a happy and joyful person, but at least I want to enjoy what there is to enjoy. I want to stop being a burden/failure to my family and friends. ",18Jul2018,1

I've never experienced suicide or depression myself so it's hard for me to understand how to help him. I don't know if I should try and probe him and get him to open up, or try take his mind off it? Should I just give him some space or try to start up conversations?

[ For example, my grandma wanted to me to drive her to see my great uncle. Which is fine. Except that I'd have to use grandpa's car, which has an automatic gear system. I've only ever driven manual cars, so this made ne anxious. Grandma said grandpa could teach me how to drive the car with ease. This made me even more anxious. (I have a thing for making a fool of myself in front of family/friends, it's really bad) 
So I said, ok, sure, I'll do it. Because I can't say no, for it makes me feel like I'm a terrible person and the guilt makes me extremely restless and sad. But then I said no again. They just picked up my sister and took her to the train station instead. And were like, ""ok, see you later!"" I felt like crying and like I had insulted them both. 
Grandma just called me, and was reassyring me that she understood my nervousness, as did grandpa. And I just had to fight back tears, because I got this wave of guilt and relief. 

You see, I am relieved that they feel that way. But I don't believe them. I feel like they're lying to me, and think I'm a terrible person. This isn't the first time I've experienced this. ]

And any feeling or thought I've had I associated with that stupid diagnosis. I've consumed myself with the idea of being ""crazy"". Until now, a few days ago something sparked deep inside my soul and possessed me to dig deep within myself and try to make sense of things that I've accepted would never make sense. To feel things I never allowed myself to feel. To uncover instances and emotions I've buried soo deep within myself I completely blocked out and forgot about almost subconsciously. And ive realized that I created this diagnosis for myself because after so many years of blocking out things that hurt me or didnt feel good ive rewired my brain to not feel things the way I should and that drove me mad over time. So when I do begin to feel the emotions that dont feel good I dont know how to handle that and I react in ways even I dont understand.

Basically, this girl (now 31 years old) claims that she is ''so allergic'' to water that she goes into anaphylactic shock if she takes a sip of water, and that she once had an operation and she was given a drip, and then had a massive allergic reaction internally because water was being put inside of her. She then goes on to say that she can drink milk and orange juice, despite them being mostly water. She also isn't constantly having an allergic reaction to her own body either, despite her saliva being mostly water and her cells constantly being bathed in water.

She then requested for her 21st birthday that a news article be made of her, so she could pose for fancy photos - https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/water-allergy-girl-reaches-21st-58672

This girl was 8 years old at the time of the first article, and the parents seem like a bunch of eccentrics themselves given that they rushed her to specialists and didn't like the answer they were given - that you can't be allergic to water, and instead got her to see homeopathic 'doctors' and Chinese herbalists. 

There's also another rather unlikely story that both this 'Heidi' person and her family like to talk about, and that is that her house was broken into, and the thief only stole her special 'spacesuit' to protect her from water vapor in the air, cutting it into tiny pieces - https://www.independent.co.uk/news/thieves-shatter-allergy-girls-life-1317690.html

This whole thing is very weird and I am wondering why this woman is doing this and also why her parents felt the need to make up something that seems as if it goes out of its way to be as ridiculous as possible and then try and turn it into an overly emotional story. 

Disclaimer: I am aware of Aquagenic Urticaria, and this isn't it, despite her claiming that it is. Her case is nowhere to be found in the medical literature and Aquagenic Urticaria only causes hives on the skin, not allergic shock and it also doesn't affect drinking.

I’ve had patterns of self-destructive behavior (including a couple of suicide attempts) since I was a teenager and people always tell me, “you’re so lucky, how could you possibly be depressed/people would kill to be in your position etc/you probably aren’t working hard enough if you have time to be depressed” and similar. It makes me feel completely invalid and the self-hatred just gets worse and worse because I feel like I don’t have the “right” to be depressed or to wake up every morning questioning the validity of my existence. It makes me feel like maybe I’m just lazy unmotivated trash like people think I am, with too much free time to wallow when I could just be doing more “constructive” things.

66,"Hey! I'm back. You don't know what my other accounts were, but if it's ever relevant to what I'm about to say, you can ask what they are and I'll tell you. You might remember some very strange fifteen year olds with throwaways posting in this subreddit... that's probably me.

I know there's something wrong with me. I would probably be having panic attacks about it if I didn't feel so emotionless.... like a sociopath. It's very strange....

I think there's a chance I might be schizophrenic. That didn't make sense to me before, but now I'm not ruling out that possibility entirely. I probably am not, though, but here's why I think there's a chance that I am.....

To clarify, I have never had a hallucination(that I'm aware of....). I don't get paranoid about being watched or anything. 

However, I feel strangely stony. The thoughts I experience every day should make me very upset, but it doesn't really make me *feel* very much at all. It wasn't always like that...

It went from me crying all the time because of my state, to feeling very emotionless and not crying, and now it's almost like both. I'm feeling stony, but also crying because I do feel it in a way, but... oh, forget it. Trying to explain anything that goes on in my mind is useless, it seems. I'm crying right now. (I'm not trying to, either. I just do.)

I have a wonderful friend, and I've become a lot closer to him in the past week. A few days ago, he was confiding a lot in me, a lot of stuff that would normally make a friend feel more emotional. I'm trying to be the best friend I can be, but as he was pouring out his heart to me I was trying to react in the right ways, but I didn't really feel very much. I mean, I don't really know how to explain it. The irony of this is that I can be very good at expressing a concept, but this is the one time it is failing me. I feel hopeless.... 

One of the symptoms mentioned in the article I'm reading(I have been reading more than one source, and I am making sure all of them are reliable) is neglect of hygiene. I have actually been way more on top of my hygiene than I was earlier this year. I do have to be prompted to shower, sometimes...(by my parents) but often I shower of my own accord. One of the reasons why I don't always want to is I sink into a very strange vortex of thought. Again, I can't explain it! Fuck this! 

I have been wearing makeup more, though, and I'm not entirely neglecting myself. I also have no reason to think my friends would see me as neglecting my hygiene, also(at least I strongly doubt)

I do sometimes feel more emotional, especially when I'm feeling especially stuck in this rut of ""I don't know what the hell's happening to me"" But is ""happening"" even really the right word, anyway? It feels kind of like nothing is really *happening,* more like I'm stuck somewhere and I can't really make out my surroundings and I have idea how to get out. 

I can't remember the last time I felt truly emotional. I used to be way more feeling. But something has found it's way inside me, metaphorically, and now it's blocking my mind. 

Maybe the last time was when I was freaking out a few weeks ago. The wonderful friend I was talking about before-- I found out a few weeks ago he is crushing on me(and I don't feel like that about him). This was a few days before I found out confirmed that he did, but I was almost sure. I was worrying about ""how's this going to end"" and whatnot, and whether he thought I liked him back, or whatever, and I full-on emotional cried. That was a few weeks ago, and I'm not entirely sure, but it may well have been the last time I really felt emotional. And I don't just mean emotional like that. I mean having proper emotional reactions to things. I know how I should react, but I just feel more blunted emotionally most of the time. 

(By the way, if you're wondering, and in case this is relevant, the story with my friend and I worked out in the end. He knows that I don't like him romantically now, but it's all good and we've actually gotten a lot closer, like I said before.)

I have not been as open with my friends as usual. The weird situation I'm in, it's taking up my whole life, and there really is hardly any way for me to open up to them more. My really good friends have been noticing, and I've been trying to handle it as best I can. But yeah.

I do sometimes say weird things to people, especially my friends(in the article it says one of the signs of schizophrenia is ""Inappropriate or irrational statements made to self or others"") The reason why I especially do it to my friends is because they're the people closest to me, and they are the people I am most concerned about being affected by what's going on with me. Usually it's a weird statement made trying to express a little bit about what is going on inside my mind, in vain. They usually react with concern. I know I should feel bad for making them concerned, and I outwardly make like I am, but  one of the constants in my life nowadays is emotionlessness..... I try to retain what I know from previous times in my life to act in the situation. I really don't deserve my friends. I envy them a little bit for not being soulless idiots like me. 

I just want the best thing for everyone to happen in the end, if I can be said to want anything at all. Wanting is an active feeling, and I don't have those anymore.... fuck it. 

I don't feel as motivated as I sometimes could be before. That's another thing.

That's all I can think of right now... but there are so many more bizarre things that I put up with in my mind every day. It's just hard to write out. I don't mean emotionally hard, I mean I don't really know how. I don't know, whatever. 

Thank you for reading this, if you did. I hope I explained everything properly and didn't give the wrong impression about certain parts of my life. Can someone please help? At least comment?

67,"To keep my backstory short, I’m 22 currently. I’ve always suffered from anxiety, even as a kid. I was brought up through some emotional abuse and trauma plus was pre disposed genetically and it greatly affected me as I hit my adolescent years. I began developing depression in my 8th grade, early 9th grade year. As I’ve gotten older it’s only gotten so much more worse. I tried therapy and a couple types of medicines my 11th grade year and it completely scared me. They diagnosed me with depression &amp; generalized anxiety.

Since then I’ve had two toxic relationships that have destroyed me completely and my anxieties have  completely taken control over me. It’s been two years since the relationship and I’ve almost completely isolated myself from friends and family. I tried moving out because i thought I needed change, and the last year has been an emotional roller coaster for me. I put my two weeks in at a job that wasn’t helping the cause a month ago because I wanted to find something new but than my anxiety took over and I couldn’t accept a new environment..

I’ve talked to my parents about moving back in and going back into therapy. I can’t continue living like this. I feel as if I’m getting worse a lot quicker than I can keep up with and it scares me :( it makes me a mess to work with sometimes because I can’t control my moods on certain days and wake up in funks that disrupt other people.

Is it logical to go back into therapy and see a psychiatrist as well after moving back into my parents? Im working a somewhat dream job rn and I still find everything wrong with it and can’t get my mind to accept it. My mind is racing 24/7 with my anxiety I can’t catch a break. As soon as the anxiety subsides an inch the depression comes in and puts the weight on my shoulders. I’ve thought of asking to cut my hours In half or applying for disability while I’m trying to fix myself?

I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense but I’m in need of others opinions at this point. I know I don’t have it bad like some people by a long shot, but idk. I don’t know what I can do anymore. I’ve been in such denial. I know life is hard for everyone but it’s so hard to wake up and have the energy to deal with the 1000s of thoughts from the anxiety while also trying to figure out how to trick your mind into believing the day would be a good day..

69,"Cannot stop being so withdrawn, no matter what I do, even going to struggle to type this. So, no real friends, had people I hung round with and was just grinded down even more, stopped hanging round with them, hoping it would make me feel better but, it hasn't. Never going back there but it's gotten to the point I just get abusive messages from them? Its just making me hate people even more than I do, without anyone to confide in, it's definitely adding too the state of mind I'm in, utterly no trust. So, been going out myself trying to make friends but when actually working up the courage to talk to people just ends up with me being ignored, sometimes mocked and I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong, it's just a constant worry at this point, everything is, even the simplest things. Spent years as a neet, say From 16 to about 24 but managed to break out, it's only ended up with me feeling sadder then ever, but I don't want to go back. I just don't know what to do, or how I can fix myself, or why I'm like this? Even now I feel what I'm typing makes no sense, just don't know and really don't understand.

70,"I needed to leave for work 10 minutes ago. I feel great, no worry. I had stuff to get done this morning, but mostly dicked around. I feel great, no worry. I have stuff to do tonight, but I know I'll end up avoiding it for self-indulgence, and feel great about it no worry. The junk around the house and shit that's overdue is piling up past my armpits. I feel great, no worries. I'm so far behind on fucking everything my own coworkers and family are kind of turning on me. I feel great, no worries. I can't get out of bed, think about suicide often, and have zero regards for my own personal benefits anymore if it's not within arms reach and even that's slipping to the point even my hygiene and caloric intake are diminishing. Still feel great, and don't worry.

I'm screaming at myself 24/7 to do what I need to do when I need to do it, but seem to have no control over myself. I feel great, no worries. I burned out three times in just under two years forcing myself through work I don't want to be doing, for people I don't like, for little benefit to myself, while sacrificing my own personal time, hobbies, social life, benefits, savings and somehow even got talked into giving up drinking.... all because I felt obligated to help.

Then it just switched off completely and I'm incapable of caring to the point it's destroying my ability to function. Turns out I can't beat my subconcious into submission forever, at some point it wrests control.

When my anxiety/care occasionally flickers back on, it burns bright making me crumple. How do I work myself out of this? I need shits to give to function, but it seems to be an all-or-nothing now.",18Jul2018,4
71,"I will do my very best to keep this as short and to the point as possible.  


This is going to be the first time that I am able to anonymously open up and beg for some help. I need to figure out how to handle my mental health issues soon. As of this post, I am 31 years old divorced, unemployed, close to homeless father of 1.  I have lost my marriage, my job, my friends and my family due to my inability to explain and conquer my illness(es).  


\- I have a severe stutter. This is a lifelong issue, but has dramatically gotten worse over the last 10 years.  
\- I am diagnosed with ""severe depression and anxiety disorder"", but I do not believe that is the correct root of my issues.  
\- I am not in control of my emotions or thoughts the majority of the time. I become angry for absolutely no reason, terribly depressed to the point of self harm and suicide attempts for no reason, I become incredibly euphoric and happy out of no where, then suddenly crash within minutes.  
\- During the ""mood swings"" mentioned above, my mind, body, and spirit become separated. I use the term ""spirit"" loosely. My body suffers the physical symptoms (sweating, fainting, vomiting, crying, etc), my mind jumps from being level to, what feels life I am being taken over. Once the feeling of being taken over hits, I feel as if I am watching my life happen without actually controlling it. As if i'm watching my life through a tv screen, screaming to body to wake up with no resolve. When I finally regain control, I typically will find myself with cuts and bruises from self harm or with suicide notes written. During all of this, the only part of my that is in control is what I will refer to as my spirit. I always retain a small part of the true me. The level, caring, hard working and loving man I know I am. However, this spirit feels layered under miles of uncontrollable burdens.  
\- It should be noted that I have never, nor currently have any shred of desire to hurt or harm ANYONE except myself.  
\- I have panic or anxiety attacks whenever I leave the house. Everything is a trigger. Sometimes I am set off by a speed bump while driving, a commercial on the radio, or even something as small as an itch on my arm will cause me to panic.  
\- I have lost almost every job I have due to these attacks. While working through an attack, I have gone as far as attempting to break my own toe just so I could go home and relieve the anxiety of being in public. I have faked injuries and illnesses and family emergencies to leave early just because the anxiety is so painful.

\- I currently am negative three-hundred dollars in my bank account. I have no income, no job, and I live in a spare bedroom in my mom's trailer. My son, 5, lives with his mother. I see him VERY often and I am incredibly fortunate. Everyone who has ever known me says with pride that I am one of the best fathers they have ever seen. My son is my best friend, and he loves me more than anyone. I need to heal my mind so I can become a functioning member of society and teach him how to live.  
\- With no job or income, I spend around 20 hours per day in my bedroom behind a closed door. I urinate into bottles instead of walking to the bathroom, which is only a foot or two away. I leave my house when needed, or when with my son. He does not see any of the bathroom habits.  
\-I have seen doctors and therapists for almost 20 years. I have done everything that has been asked of me, taken every pill as prescribed and have followed all orders. Nothing has ever come close to helping me, except marijuana. No matter how severe the attack, how panicked or even how close I am to killing myself, one or two hits of marijuana levels me out perfectly. I do not get ""high"", not matter how much I smoke. I only seem to get level, to a point where I feel completely in control of everything. No other pill or therapist has ever been able to help me get to this level of peace.  
\- Obviously, smoking marijuana raises a number of concerns. If I choose that route, I cannot pass drug tests ethically, run the risk of being arrested and I would use whatever little money I have. But sometimes it literally comes down to a matter of life or death. An example, I had become terribly suicidal for no legitimate reason. I had texted a crisis line, but it only made it worse. I drove to a bridge and prepared to jump, but decided to smoke one single hit instead. I was leveled out and better within minutes.  
\- I have applied for disability benefits to help me financially survive while I tackle my health full time, but I am positive I will get denied due to my age and my simple diagnosis.

What the hell do I do? What is wrong with me? How do I heal and get money to buy food? I am running out of time, and I feel all of my options to fight off whatever is wrong with me are fading. Most of my friends, family and my wife have all abandoned me due to these issues. Can someone please try to give me just the slightest bit of direction? Thank you for taking the time.

73,"I feel like I have no ability to deal with anything or to control my emotions. Whenever something mildly bad happens, it completely messes my whole day up and I get into a dark, suicidal phase.

For example, I have had an amazing day all this morning. Didn't have a care in the world and was being extremely happy and social with everyone at work. Well, my mom stopped talking to me because I wouldn't do exactly what she wanted me to do (move to Houston) and I haven't heard from her in weeks. I called and texted her today while on break to check up on her and she completely ignored me (still posting stuff on Facebook). This completely destroyed my mood and I legitamately considered running my car off the cliff. I feel better now, but can't figure out why I do that.

Another example: a few days ago, I was playing video games and enjoying my evening. My girlfriend and I got into a mild argument, nothing too serious, but I thought about killing myself. I was overreacting, but the smallest thing that upsets me makes me want to end it all. It's like my emotions have no middle ground. I'm either perfectly fine or wanting everything to end.

76,I always am searching stuff about health info and depression and stuff trying to diagnose myself on the internet and stuff until I start to believe it and that is what cyber and hypocondria means ,18Jul2018,1
77,"First of all, I would like to say that I have been to a psychiatrist and he has loosely (maybe better termed informally) diagnosed me with depression. I've gone through speech therapy but stopped as he felt I was getting better (this was around late 2017). Since then, I haven't been back. 

Throughout the past year (October 2017-now), I've dealt with a ton of rejection, stress and overall anxiety. It's my last year of high school and I had been applying to colleges. I applied to colleges in the UK and was rejected from 3/5 of them. This was a harsh blow to me as I had always associated/defined myself by my academic success. It might not seem like a lot for many of you but to me it was quite a harsh blow and I had to grow a lot through the failures. 

Unlike the American system, I was required to take an exam this May which would account for 50-80% of my total grade. I didn't do as well as I would have liked and am now potentially not going to college next fall. The college contacted me saying that I didn't meet their requirements and would have to wait until late August for a decision to be made basically. This stress, coupled with the stress of my exams + finding out the results, has really taken a toll on me. I feel as if I'm in a  state of perpetual stress and I have been since March. This is exhausting and I don't really know what to do. I really want to go to this college and there's nothing I can do but wait; but the wait is truly excruciating. 

The whole college/bad results fiasco happened in a span of about two weeks and I'm still recovering. Initially I felt really sad and was crying **a lot** but since then I have started feeling better. I've managed to get out of bed and shower and eat whilst previously I was unable to even get myself groomed or have a meal. I've gotten my appetite back and have started feeling more optimistic. However, despite this, I still feel incredibly empty at times. I don't really know how to describe it but I just feel nothing- like my heart or where my heart is supposed to be, it feels just hollow. Sometimes late at night I feel like I'm dissociated from myself, as if I am another person and I'm just going through the motions. I don't know how to really explain it but it just doesn't seem like I am alive or that this is reality. I don't really know what's going on right now and I don't think it warrants a visit back to the psychiatrist. I just think I'm under a lot of pressure with the whole college thing being in limbo (I don't do well with uncertainties and I have very bad anxiety when I am in situations which are ambiguous or uncertain). I don't really even know what I am hoping to get out of writing this but I just really want to know what I can do to feel less blah and less nothing and to feel something I guess... ",18Jul2018,1

And this is the problem: I tend to be very clinging in relationships and also destroyed those because of that. Now I'm in a process of learning with my current partner of 1.5yrs, I know he loves me and would never cheat on me - yet, when he goes out with a friend of female sex, I can get quite crazy. I fucking know the chance he does anything is quite low but still I feel sort of left out, sometimes get running thoughts about self-harm and maybe suicide (but anything but not suicidal, I want to live pluuuus I receive treatment!) and this weird nervosity with thoughts circling about him being out. To release this nervosity I'd like to harm myself or drink alcohol or shit like that. I'm afraid he could forget me and often I'd like to cry. At the same time, I could lose all of my temper and break everything as I usually get quite agressive. But with medication, this has lowered a lot and doesn't happen that often anymore.

82,"This post could be about relationships or mental illness, but I believe the issues are caused by mental health. 

The title is a bit of a give or take sort of thing, but nonetheless I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 months and I’ve known him for over two years. We talked about what we want from a relationship, which is commitment, so we decided to give it a shot. When I was visiting his friends with him I saw a girls name on his phone. To cut to the chase, he lied, a lot. I mean a lot. He met the girl on tinder from his hometown, stopped talking to her for a bit, then when he went back they began hanging out with mutual friends as a group and he remained friends with her. He did ignore my requests to block her which was very wrong. He ended up crashing at her place because his inconsistent friend (I’ve verified this part, so I know he’s not just pulling my leg about it,) couldn’t actually let him crash at his place after they started drinking one night. I knew something was up so we fought about this girl pretty often. I brought it up just about every day. Our relationship being temporarily long distance put a bit of a strain on things so I began to stress out. Eventually he left me and went to be with her. I know hearing this is an obvious “dump him.” 

But, before I started really seeing him, I knew about his past history, not just relationships but his family. He had a very rough childhood, I did too, but him not getting help for it (like I did,) causes issues. He’s been in very serious relationships that have ended in the worst ways, I’ve really never had a serious relationship but have always had serious issues with my father. I’ve especially never looked past someone’s mistakes, not to this extent. I was pretty bad before I started therapy so I can’t just throw him away simply because he has issues considering anytime mine come up he drops everything for me. I realize talking to other women isn’t okay, and he knows I’m not okay with it. He’s owned up to things, he’s agreed to doing all the things I’ve asked to help me build trust for him again, and I do think he’s trying. He admits he has issues and new relationships are always scary to him at first and that’s his reasoning. I know pain and mental illness changes things for people so I’m doing my best to understand. I know talking to girls has nothing to do with mental health but abandonment issues does and that’s what he’s admitted himself, to having. I believe him and I’m trying to move past it but I think it’s natural to feel worried. Is the effort I’m putting in worth it? I believe he’s trying but I’m not a mind reader. ",18Jul2018,1
83,"So long story short - I just spent 5 days in-patient at a very highly regarded mental health facility in the North East for Bipolar disorder, Major Depression &amp; Anxiety. I got off my meds and needed a few days to get back to ""normal"". I was so impressed with the hospital that once I had been stabilized and was working on my discharge plan, I was offered the opportunity to do a partial outpatient program and I said yes without even giving it even a second thought. That program was to start tomorrow. I had transportation set up via my health care provider and a friend to stay with while I attended said program.

The transportation I was to receive was to be provided free of charge via the State Health Program I currently have which worked out beautifully as I do not currently own or have access to a vehicle. The transportation was also set to pick me up from the friend's house I mentioned and take me round trip from his house to the hospital and back for two weeks as I completed the program. Unfortunately my ride scheduled for tomorrow was canceled by the provider because of some system glitch and not only can I not make it there tomorrow, but they won't be able to provide transportation at all as the do not cover the geographical area I am in. So there is the first hiccup. I have already alerted my mental health team and they were thankfully very understanding. Now typically I would just pay for my own transportation however, at the current point in time, I am unemployed. I put all of my money into starting a new business that I was shortly voted out of after opening day because of something I'd rather not get into here. So, I'm broke. About ten dollars to my name broke. 

In addition to all of this -- the friend that said ""No problem, stay here while you get better!"" just changed his mind without giving a reason so now I am officially homeless (I am writing this to you right now from a tent in the woods - no BS). I am unable to stay with my family because they have been deemed toxic and done many many terrible things to me when I was not well like neglect me, emotionally abuse me, threaten me with police / legal involvement, etc. So that's not an option. I am also not comfortable staying with friends typically as I don't like feeling like I'm walking on eggshells which I usually do. It just adds to the stress. One friend said he typically would but right now is just a rough time for him and his family and I respect that &amp; his honesty. He is one of the few that is truly a really great friend.

So yeah, I'm living in a tent in the woods hoping I don't get arrested while also trying to keep myself nourished / hydrated  and of a positive state of mind with absolutely no money or transportation except for a mountain bike and well, my feet.

In average, I sleep for 3 hours. I spend my nights at twitter, political news sites, reddit (nsfw included) or video games. 

The most problemmatic part about my mental health is that I have serious problems with my father, mother and my gf; the people I not just love but also adore and who I can die for. I can not communicate with my father anymore since we fight everytime we try to talk. On the other hand I behave really crappy to my mother and I cannot handle it. With my gf, I have both of the problems. If it goes like this, I am going to lose her for sure which will damage me seriously till end of my life. I am not sure that I can handle a break up like this. She blames me that I behave her badly and I behave like a child. Every passing day I feel like she is getting nearer to abandoning me.

Psychologically, I feel like shit. I am broke as hell, I try to survive and build an empire while paying my family’s debts and with every day passing on, I feel like I am getting closer to losing the fight. I feel alone but I actually I know that I am not alone. I secretly thank to my gf that she wouldn’t abandon me yet.

If anyone of you survived an hell like this; I need advices. I am open to mild medication, a different perspective or any thought at all. I am in need of help.


TLDR; I am disorganised, depressed I procrastrinate and I damage my relations with the people I love. I need some help &amp; advices.

89,"Any thoughts on having video chats with a therapist? I had a roommate who has weekly Skype sessions with her therapist and they seemed to work well. As a college student, it be more convenient for me to talk to someone via compute than have to jump leaps and bounds to attend therapy sessions in my hometown.",18Jul2018,2
90,"Hello everyone! I hope everyone is doing okay today. Don’t forget to drink some water, take your meds, and take a shower. 

Anyway. So I’m transferring to a 4 year college this fall from a community college. I am in the engineering honors program and studying to be a civil engineer. I have an internship at an engineering firm close to school. 

I have to maintain a heavy course load (16 units minimum=20+ class hours) and achieve a 3.4 GPA minimum each semester. I don’t have to work, but I don’t want to miss out on $$ and internship experience, so I’ll be working 10-13 hours a week. 

I am in the disabled students program and will be receiving accommodations. 

I haven’t taken my medications in over 5 months and I’m doing pretty okay. I think I’ll start back on them tonight in order to get used to them in a month when school starts. 

I am seeking advice from fellow overachievers with anxiety. Or from any students or former students with anxiety. 

How do you stay calm at school? Who do you talk to? Where do you go to cry? How do you manage your anxiety? How do you manage not being perfect 24/7? Do you exercise consistently? Does it help? Are you a perfectionist like me? 

Comment with any advice or anecdotes. Message me if you wanna chat. 

Thanks,

M",18Jul2018,3
91,"I feel, in a lot of ways, like a blank slate. Since 2016, I've been questioning very heavily my sexual preference and gender identity. It's been getting even worse as the years went by. Right now, I'm even questioning my hobbies, interests, even down to the pieces of media I used to enjoy. I used to be SUPER into geek culture and history, and now everything I thought I enjoyed always leaves me bored and indifferent. I try to get a feel of what I now gravitate towards, and all I feel are primal urges of masochism, rape, and hurting others. That's all I seem to now like and it scares the shit out of me. I don't know what's going on with me. I'm so scared.",18Jul2018,0
94,"Hello everyone, I'm in a situation where I'm desperate for advice and some would ask, turn to your friends, they know you best, right? Unfortunately most of my friends give horrible advice... so I'll have to turn to reddit ;]

So I'm a junior in High School right now, and I've just been invited to a graduation party from one of my senior friends. Fun right? Nope. Last party I went to, Isat in the bathroom for about 7 long minutes because I was having an actual panic attack from all the people i had to meet and compete in a conversation with. 

New party, new me. I actually want to prepare for this party and make it count. After all this graduate is my best friend and he knows me pretty well, minus the fact that I never once in our 13 years of friendship told him I have BPD, and a whole other slur of mental disorders.

Now that I supplied some context, what are some precautions I can do to have a better time? Like, any foods get you hype or something? *ANY*ADVICE IS WELCOMED. I dont even care if you copy and paste it from a website.

P.S (I already googled ""how to prepare for a party"" and it sucked...)",18Jul2018,0
95,"I have this tendency, when I’m in a good mood, to take over a conversation and talk about myself and stuff that interests me. When the other person replies, it either has to be a positive comment on what I’ve said or something that I can really relate to and have an interest in. Otherwise, I find myself not really caring too much about what people say and getting bored very quickly. My attention span with people is not long unless what they tell me is riveting or humorous or giving me new info that I care about.

I listen carefully and reply accordingly but don’t feel anything at times. My mom told me the other day that one of her friends is dying of cancer and I was trying so hard to fake sympathy but my voice just came out as bland when I said “Oh my gosh, really? That’s so sad.”. Many times, I sound really fake because I honestly don’t care what others say so I reply with disinterest.

I feel like I also manipulate people with my emotions at times too and don’t realize it. Like I feel a certain way only to make other people feel the way that I want them to feel. I could be wrong and I could be over-psychoanalyzing myself though. 

It’s really hard to know because most people don’t know how they really are towards people. At times, I think my behavior is fine and then people will sometimes tell me that I’m selfish or conceited or rude. I don’t actively try to be any of those things. 

Sometimes I look pissed with the world and shut people out and most of the time people don’t understand that that’s how I am and I have nothing against anyone. It’s a little frustrating at times and I have to kiss up to people by giving them a behavior or mood they makes them comfortable (i.e. A fake smile here, a laugh there, etc.) and I hate that. I hate having to fake something I’m not genuinely feeling.

As I’ve aged, my personality has evolved into this thing that I can’t even understand anymore. I use to get myself and now I’m at a loss again. Feels like, at times, that I’m studying a different person than myself. My mood chances so quick that I might as well be a different person.

Okay. End of rant. Thanks for reading. Sorry for the abrupt ending. I didn’t want to write an entire book because I could’ve gone on and on.

I just want someone that can relate or give me advice.",18Jul2018,0

98,"For background I have GAD and had MDD which is now controlled with medication &amp; self-management. I might have ADHD. I've done both CBT &amp; DBT. GAD wasn't managed but I was coping with it.

So - I'm having some mild burnout symptoms, mild derealization (only occasional) and really bad difficulty concentrating. My emotions are very numb so I don't feel anxiety or sadness (no crying, no moping, no heart palpitations or intrusive images or sounds) but I'm behaving as if I was anxious (difficult to explain but I'm avoiding things, feel discomfort in certain situations, difficulty making decisions).

Although these problems have been very mild, I'm finding it very difficult to take care of myself. I am behind on laundry, on cooking, I'm behind at grad school. My finances aren't great either.

Question is - where do I go from here? My GP is away on holiday. Our mental health clinic only sees severe patients so I can't see my psychiatrist. I'm not sure my problems are severe enough for therapy (seeing a psychologist). I have also already done several ""courses"" of therapy, and I'm also not sure that it would help me with decision making and concentration. 

I'm feeling a bit lost &amp; confused.",18Jul2018,1
99,"I work for a school district and I get “vacations” quite often. kids are out, I’m out. Summers are the longest and the hardest. I tend to get into a routine of binging on absolutely every detail of day. Same breakfast, same show, same position in bed for 8 hours while my husband works. I usually spiral almost immediately being that my job is one of the very, very few things that I love doing and makes me feel as if I have a purpose. I usually apply to summer camps or recreational day camps-something to keep me happy and occupied. This summer I didn’t manage to get any work and tried to really change up my routine as to not get stuck and try to enjoy my summer. It worked for the first three weeks and now I can’t seem to see anything but thoughts. I hate feeling so selfish towards my husband and even towards myself. I can’t find motivation, I have watched the same episode of sharp objects on hbo for the past 3 days even though I’ve read the book. I try to get out of the house, I try to socialize with my parents, nothing is helping. I have almost made 3 major, irresponsible purchases in the last hour and the only thing stopping me not remembering the 3 digit code on the back of my card (two love birds, a motorcycle and a condo) 

I have zero motivation but yearn for mental stimulation. I sit outside sometimes and sit in the rising sun hoping it’ll be a great way to start the day! I end up sun sick and with an odd tan. I’m so disassociated when around loved ones and I see myself and I’m snapping my fingers and it’s almost as if I am on mute. 

I want to be outdoors, I want to roller skate, I want to collect leaves, read outdoors. 

Any suggestions on the war with my mind? ",18Jul2018,1
