0,"I soon have my first psych evaluation after being referred by my GP. I have been in a horrible state, and he wants me to get a proper diagnosis so we can form a plan. I'm 99% sure I am BPD, however there may be other factors as well. One of the reasons i have self-dx as BPD is because my mother struggled with it my entire adult life, eventually leading to her suicide five years ago. A lot of my struggles mirror that of my mother's, though I'm sure I wouldn't agree during an ""episode"". To what degree do I share this on my first visit? I'm having a lot of anxiety and don't know what to expect.",15Apr2018,1
2,"i’m not sure what’s wrong. i’ve only noticed a difference in myself in the past year; i used to be strong and i could hold in my emotions and crying and i generally would just bury what i felt because i didn’t want anyone like my family or friends to have to listen to my problems, i felt like a burden, but now i’m constantly crying and i constantly feel depressed as fuck. i’m a senior in high school and my grades are slipping and i don’t even care. i’ve told my mom i want to go to therapy but she doesn’t do anything about it and my dad just laughs in my face and tells me i don’t need it and they both just say “everyone has problems” “everyone feels sad sometimes”

but it’s not just the occasional blue day. it’s everyday every moment of the day. i still feel happiness and there are times i’m having so much fun with my friends but i always feel an underlying sadness that i can’t seem to shake. i feel the urge to cry almost 24/7, i’ll be sitting in class and feel like just bawling my eyes out. i take 4-5 hour naps everyday and i never want to leave my bed.  

my friends are too narcissistic and everytime i try to vent they just turn the conversation around on themselves. i used to be close with my brother and my mom, like SO close, and now they constantly tell me how trashy i’ve become and put down all my decisions and tell me what a bad idea everything i want to do is and my brother constantly insults me and i don’t know what happens. i know my mom favors him and i think they gang up on me at times. 

i don’t know what’s happened to me my dad threatens to take my phone and my car and my freedom if i don’t make my grades good again but i literally do not care i have no motivation to bring them up. 

i’m not a professional so i can’t diagnose myself and i wouldn’t even know where to start. any help or suggestions?

3,"I feel like I’m not really worth anything. I don’t have any friends and my family hates me. My s/o isn’t happy with me. I’m unemployed, overweight, lazy, selfish, bitchy, needy, clingy, mean, and a whole slew of other things. 

How can I get better when I don’t have income to get help? Just go see a therapist isn’t an option due to money. 

I just want to be enough to actually be worth something. The way I see it now, I don’t want any kind of legacy, but I’m too worthless in my own life to do anything. Why exist then? I’m just taking resources that would go to someone who deserves it. Because I honestly don’t. ",15Apr2018,2
7,"I hope it’s okay for me to post this here, I just don’t really like to bring this stuff up with people I know. I struggled a lot with depression and anxiety last year and I’m in a much better place than I was, but something just doesn’t seem right. I feel fine some of the time, but often have mood swings - they seem to get worse and worse. I know it’s probably stress from exams, or the fact I’m an 18 year old girl lol, but both those are out of my control really. I guess I should work a little on stress management. But that doesn’t change the fact that I’ve been very self destructive for a while now (periods of self harm, sexual promiscuity I guess?) and I can’t seem to maintain friendships or relationships with people. I’m overly paranoid about what people think of me sometimes, and overly rebellious other times. I don’t know, it’s difficult to get a grasp on whether I’m okay because the lines are blurred I guess. I know everyone probably feels the same way, and that I’m probably just being dramatic and problematic, but it just feels like there’s some sort of disconnect between me and other people. Every now and then I’ll get involved with someone and it makes me feel amazing, and then I fuck it up and I have to work at bringing myself back up to feeling alright again. And then I wonder why I can’t make anything last, be it new friendships or relationships. People who don’t know me try to put me in a box sometimes - “you can’t accept affection which is why you do this” “you’ve got trust issues which is why you do that” — but I don’t think any of that’s true. I know it’s probably normal to be this way, I don’t know. I’m really struggling to just stay okay. I just want to be accepted by people - I can’t even tell if they like me or not half the time because I’m so stupidly influenced by my emotions, despite the fact I value logic over everything else. I don’t think there’s any way I will ever understand it, even my mother has shook her head at me in the past because she “just doesn’t understand me”. I don’t know, sorry about this lol. I’ll probably delete this in the morning when I realise what a whiny brat I’m being. ",15Apr2018,3

I've been dealing with a lack of emotion for a while. Everything is a sea of gray. I don't have joy or pleasure even in hobbies I have typically enjoyed. 

I have a lot of reasons to be dealing with this. My husband died in December. He is the love of my life and I still haven't managed to realize at my base level that he is gone. I regularly think during my day ""I can't wait to tell my husband about this"" or waking up, rolling over looking for him. 

I am dealing with some health issues that are both traumatizing and require extensive medical follow up. I am looking forward to an EEG, MRI, biopsy, and cardio workup in the near future. I am not allowed to drive or exercise. We have no idea why. 

The state of the world is deeply upsetting to me. I can't avoid it as my job is directly involved with the US government and all of my friends are political. I saw this morning that we are bombing Syria and I just sunk deeper into the fog. 

My therapist wants me to do something that I always did with my husband to ""reclaim"" it and, in the process, feel something even if it is grief/sorrow. 

I don't know about this. I feel like grief is a monster that I experience and try to run from. I have not been crying and I don't know what to do. I don't want to feel like I am losing my husband? I am lost. I want to trust my therapist but. ",15Apr2018,1

She said she was going to apply, and her mom mentioned that they’re considering it, but my other friend says she probably won’t. This has made me very upset and I don’t know what to do. I’m not even exactly sure why it makes me upset. Is it because I’m afraid she’ll get smarter than me at the other school?

One problem. My sense of perception is very off. Anytime I go into a public place, I find it overwhelming. I’ve gotten better though; but I CANNOT deviate my eyes very far.

Today I was at the grocery store and could only look at things directly in front of me, and definitely not people. I’m sure I look odd to others if they are trying to get my attention. I cannot at all make eye contact with strangers.

So lately I've been considering going back to work part time. I talked to therapist and she was hesitant. Said I should try volunteering a few hours one or two days... And NOT go back to work (yet).

Well... it's a really good thing I didn't just start applying places. I helped the next door neighbor with a new fence between us... like... all day. I kept having panic attacks and thought my heart was stopping. My hand was cramping and bleeding but I felt like I couldn't tell him I needed to stop. So I slapped a band-aid on and kept going. The only break we took, I spent watering the garden. I kept thinking ""take care of yourself, Mary,"" but kept not doing anything about it. Finally I was able to muster a little ""my hand's starting to cramp"" ... Then after a few more boards he asked me if it was hurting really badly, I said yeah and then he asked me if I wanted to stop or keep going. It was really hard for me to say ""let's stop"" 😟

19,"I'm 18 years old, turning 19 in September, and I've realized I'm nothing but a stupid baby. I'm terrified to do anything ""adult-like"". I haven't got a job, driver's license, money, car, I don't know where my birth certificate or SSN is, I was diagnosed with ""selective mutism"" years ago by the only therapist I could ever somewhat talk to. I can't talk to anyone I don't know. I just freeze and shut down immediately. 

I've never had a father figure in my life, and my mother has neglected me my entire life. She's never ""made"" me do things I needed to do so I could learn to not be afraid of things. She's neglected my type 1 diabetic needs for years now; I tell her several times for weeks or months that I need insulin, glucose testing supplies, or pump supplies, and she refuses to get them until I've run out completely and haven't had any for a week. I've had 3 or 4 diabetic seizures since mid-December because I sleep too much and don't want to eat. My mom doesn't seem to care at all. She's always on her cellphone, ignoring everything around her, house and pets included.

I have no friends or other family members to help me. All my ""friends"" have just up and left me, ignoring my messages or telling me to fuck off.

The end of July 2016, I met someone on a social media site, whom I later found out is something called my twin flame/twin soul/mirror soul. There are ""phases"" to these connections, and we've been in the separation phase since March 2017. Being the ""chaser"", I knew something about them was different, and I tried over and over to get them to talk to me again with no avail. I finally stopped when their last words to me were about filing a police report if I contacted them again. I began doing meditations in January, and they have helped us both (or so I think) quite a bit. And yet, they are still running. 

I am at a complete loss at what to do anymore. I need to get away from this house I live in. I feel as if I might die because of a seizure one day. I have no emotional support whatsoever. The only place I know to go is to my twin flame. But I've been saying this for months now. Since September 2017 to be exact. I still haven't even tried to leave. I'm terrified. If my twin flame slams the door in my face, my only options at that point are go to jail, kill myself, or become a whore and hope to fuck someone takes me to their home and cares for me.

I'm scared of everything. The thing I'm scared of the most is being alone forever. I know my twin flame made me feel so much better each day. I'd run home after school each day to talk to them, and they could always make me laugh when I hadn't even smiled all day. I feel like I helped them feel better too. I know they have a really shitty time at school and home as well and I really want to be there for them. I love them more than anything or anyone that has or ever will exist. I don't want them to do something they don't need to do just because their mom threw a bitch fit or because of mean comments people give them constantly.

But I'm terrified to do anything. Because I'm just a blind child with nothing but unconditional love to give to the one that means everything to me.

26,"I have not been well, and am struggling to find myself and to understand my priorities.

Think about glittery gold nail polish.  It's appealing, but why?  First off, you should be wearing minimal polish.  Or none.  Second of all, you'd be giving into a consumerist mentality by buying the polish.  Third, you'd be wasting money that you don't have or that should be saved. Fourth, you'd be giving into a vain mentality. Finally, you'd be trying to find confidence and happiness in appearance because you are too much of a failure to find it in your (lack of) success.
This is what flew through my mind when a Buzzfeed quiz told me that I'd be suited for a glittery golden nail polish.
The initial sense of delight turned into guilt over that delight, and a sense that I wasn't deserving of wearing such a loud color.  I don't have a career, I thought.  They'll get the wrong impression of me. And then, I thought, Maybe the fact that I want to wear this color proves that I'm not cut out for a professional career. 

This thought was followed with a pang of anxiety in my gut, along with guilt and shame.

To top it off, I felt lonely.  Lonely that I'd had such a strong reaction to such an innocent quiz.

And yet, I still can't figure out why I want to wear the color, despite the embarrassment I'd feel wearing it.

I've been killing myself with stress-in fact, I've never felt so isolated, stressed, lost, or afraid in my life.  It's beyond reason, and beyond hope.  I've cut my hair to look older and smarter (and now look like a tired, middle aged lady at the age of 21), and I've been suffering through a 9-year-long weight loss struggle to better fit societal standards.  And no, I'm not trying to change my appearance out of vanity.  Or to be admired, or loved. I stopped doing it out of vanity when I realized that I had no reason to be vain, for my lack of success has made it impossible for me to feel deserving of any beauty or praise.  No amount of attention, or glares, or happiness with my own appearance will change the feeling of deep failure that is within me.  In fact, I feel an even bigger sense of failure and sham when I spend any time at all trying to better my appearance.  Even face creams, which I apply nightly to avoid another acne disaster, make me feel guilty-because I truly believe myself to be undeserving of them.

So I lie here, with dull, unpolished nails, a Fitbit around my wrist, with a goop of face cream on my tired and aging face, wearing a grandmotherly robe and sitting alone in my room at 3:05 AM on a Saturday night.  Frustrated.  So, unbelievably frustrated.  And tired. With life, with myself, with my situation, with my family--with  absolutely everything.  And after spending several hours watching Jersey Shore to escape my reality for a bit, I can't help but feel jealousy.  Jealousy at the cast, who spend their days at the gym, tanning, doing daily laundry, then going out to clubs.  I can't help but feel jealousy towards their lack of shame, and admiration at their acceptance of a certain tacky lifestyle.  I sit here in my room, aging prematurely and absolutely, undoubtedly depressed.  With a dull and tiring sense of dread for tomorrow.  It's a dread that I've begun to fear, and one that I cannot seem to escape. 

And so, if you're still wondering: why not just paint your nails the golden color and embrace your desire to run away from it all, if you're so miserable?

I answer with: I cannot come up with any sort of answer to this question, and it is for this reason that I am so miserable.

40,"As a kid, I had some anxiety issues, where I'd panic so much that I'd throw up and be unable to move or breathe. I was a full-blown hypochondriac; constantly convincing myself I was sick was what I was good at.

Now I'm 19, and I haven't listened to my anxiety. Maybe I still am a hypochondriac deep down, since I never went on medication and never got therapy because my mom didn't believe in that stuff, and thought I could overcome it on my own..

However, maybe my hypochondria is coming back full-force. I just can't tell what to trust and what's in my head.

For the past few months, things have been a little...weird. It started with weird sleeping habits, where I couldn't fall asleep or kept waking up in the middle of the night. Then I noticed other things gradually starting. But now, I can't even remember what order they came in. I can't even remember member what *day* it is sometimes, let alone what little things I was convincing myself to feel that day.

People have said I'm more...awkward? I guess? And more withdrawn. I have yet to notice that, but it wouldn't be surprising because I *am* an introvert. Admittedly, I hate being around people.

I've also gotten more feelings of mistrust. *Way more feelings.* As a kid, I was bullied and had fake friends constantly who would go behind my back and make fun of me, so naturally, I do have some trust issues. But for about a month, maybe more, I can't trust any one of my friends. It started with one girl in my group. My conscience said that I can't trust her, and now, I don't think I can. And then it spread to other people - people who I thought were my friends - and I don't feel like I can trust anyone. I feel like they're talking about me behind my back. I swear I think I've heard them talk about me behind my back. My conscience says I have.

I had to cover up my phone camera because I know people were looking in on me. I couldn't shake the feeling they were, and while I don't have direct proof, my conscience says they are.

Other little things have been happening - I keep seeing things out of the corner of my eyes, like things are moving or falling or sometimes I even see someone when there isn't anyone there. I hear things, like my name being called or like a friend talking to me when they're actually not.

I also just feel detached. Emotionally and literally. Literally because I feel like nothing is real and I'm the only real thing in a fake world. I feel like everything is fabricated around me. And emotionally because I just feel unmotivated and disinterested in everything. A few weeks ago my friends donated a couple thousand dollars to me to help me go on a trip I've wanted to go on forever, but not only did I fail to show the emotion I wanted to, but I really didn't feel anything towards them. I still felt like I couldn't trust some of them, despite them just giving me so much money.

I'm not stupid. I know the signs of paranoid schizophrenia. And while I'm not a professional, I don't think they're real symptoms, though...

Here's the problem: What if I'm not actually experiencing these things? What if I'm just convincing myself of it? What if I saw something about schizophrenia and then decided that I was going to have that? It's happened before, in the past. That's why I don't think I truly have it, and I'm not about cry to someone when I don't actually have something wrong with me. That's embarrassing.

Here's why I don't think I have it:

&gt; I'm self aware of my symptoms, and schizophrenics aren't. Sure, I don't think they're real symptoms, but schizophrenics don't even *know* they have symptoms.

&gt; Schizophrenia doesn't just manifest at 18 or 19.

&gt; I'm a former hypochondriac, and formerly had some anxiety issues. Enough said.

&gt; The symptoms are supposed to stay, whereas mine fade in an out. Some days I feel fine, others have weird hours or whatever. It's so gradual it's probably just fake and whenever I can remember ""oh yeah, I have to be schizo"" is when I actually show symptoms. They never stick. Then again, I don't know what comes first - the symptoms or the thought of ""Oh I'm sick"". Because if the thought comes first, it's definitely hypochondria. I just don't know what comes first.

&gt; I have more moments of ""clarity"" than not. Sometimes I feel weird and foreign in myself, in my own body or room or whatever, but usually I don't.

&gt; I still think rationally. Admittedly, my thoughts have been more jumbled as of late, where I sometimes can't focus and often lose my train of thought, but that's probably stress from school. I AM in college, after all...

&gt; My conscience is always an ass. Always. I used to be able to shut it up but now it seems like everything is on the verge of spilling out, and that's because my conscience is an ass. Like the other day my friend was complaining and I just wanted to tell her what my conscience was saying ""god just shut the fuck up for two seconds in your goddamn life"".

There are other things for both symptoms and why I don't think I'm symptomatic actually, but this is a long post already and you don't wanna hear me complain about my problems further.

I just don't know what to trust. Do I trust the logical side of me that says ""you're a hypochondriac, you're fine"" or do I trust the hypochondriac side of me that says ""no, seriously, there's something wrong this time"".

I'm all sorts of confused and messed up.",15Apr2018,1

The friends I have are fine and keep contact online. Most people that know me and get to know me see I am pretty ordinary.
Strangers can be so evil I simply give up.

To top it, because people heard I've been in a hospital, some started a rumor I was on hard drugs . uhm when I never even tried them... so wtf? not only stigma but because junkies abuse prescription pills, you get thrown in their basket because people are so ignorant about anything psyche meds. Fucking lol. Do I really deserve people believing lies about me?

Also another thing is, due to my past psychotic episodes which destroyed most of chances of a normal life, I think I cannot repair my rep at all, or get over the past.

I'm not dependent on anyone (self employed so my own boss) , so I switched interest to just work and money and I feel satisfaction and good.
But I want to quit with society, new people, going outdoors , doing most social things, simply avoid everyone and places as much as I can.
That minimal basic need of social interactions is done online and it is enough.

Another thing, before I had problems , I always had a girlfriend. if we finished it was just a bit until I got a new one. After the problems, although I still had some girlfriends, I noticed I lost all will for dating, since I already know as soon as she hears about my past and diagnosis it will all change quickly lol. People chat shit so I have so many rumors lies about me that I'm scorned in the beginning.

51,"Hi Everyone!

First, sorry if this isn't the most descriptive or most well written post, but putting thoughts/feelings into words is something i'm not the best at. 

  So I wish I could say i knew what was going on with me, but I have such a fear of interaction with strangers/other people in general, I can't bring myself to getting professional help. Talking to another person about my problems and life absolutely terrifies me.
Talking to others, unfortunately, isn't my only issue. At this point, due to the fear of interacting with other people, I have completely stopped looking for work. I'm 23 living at home with my parents. They both want me to be working and have the ability top support myself, but there's no way I can tell them how I've really been feeling. 

All of my troubles seemed to have started when I was young, around 13 or 14, and I started to realize that I was gay, and they weren't just thoughts. 

  After the realization that I was gay, and I couldn't change it, my whole body just shut down. I can't remember the last time i was genuinely happy and was enjoying life. Now every night I stay awake as long as possible, trying to avoid tomorrow. I'll watch movies, play games, anything to distract myself that tomorrow is coming and I should probably sleep. 

  I'll lay awake at night wondering what it would be like if the next time I fell asleep, I never woke up. These thoughts are daily, but I know that I will never act on them, which makes me hate myself even more. 

  When I was 17, I was hospitalized overnight because I couldn't take it anymore and mentioned to a friend that I hoped that night was the night I finally went through with it. I know now that I could never actually end my life, but the constant thoughts telling me to just do it and having not being able to communicate my feelings is slowly eating away at me. 

 Always being the shy quiet kid at school that would almost never talk, I literally have zero friends, and no one to talk to, but 99.9% of the time, if someone were to invite me to something, I would most likely turn it down. 

  I hate myself even more when someone asks if i'm ok, and i tell them everything is fine when I know in my mind that nothing is right and I so desperately want something to make my life a little better at least for now. 

  I don't know how I will ever be able to have a normal job when the fear of talking is too much for me. I've turned down multiple job interviews/opportunities because the thought of me and someone else alone in a room for an interview makes me panic. I would rather sit alone in my room with nobody than have to sit alone with a stranger and talk. I actually sat here with a fully typed post ready to go for 45 minutes before I could work up the courage to anonymously share this with all of you. 

If anyone has and Ideas what might be going on with me, or how to help, please share below. My thoughts at this point are just social anxiety causing depression so I've been reading up on that but i'm not certain of anything.

55,"After a couple of visits and chats with my doctor, I had been prescribed Zoloft for depersonalisation/depression/anxiety. I see it as a viable option, but was slightly taken aback at how easily the doctor prescribed it given how psychoactive it is and its well documented side effects. I was going to try it in combination with some diet tweaks (I already eat healthy enough, just cut down on sugar and coffee) and meditation, while I wait for my psychologist appointment.

I was wondering if anybody could share their experiences on before and after in regards to sleep, libido, and sports.

I don't think my libido is naturally high, I maybe get aroused about once every 1-2 weeks, and even then it's because of something I randomly come across, like some nsfw reddit post. My sleep could be described as average, I sleep 7-8 hrs a day, sometimes wake up at night. Most days switch off like a light, sometimes have trouble falling asleep because I had a nap after work. Sports are very important to me - it's currently my best healthy outlet. If Zoloft is going to make me feel more lethargic and less willing to do sports - it would be crushing for me. I currently run and lift.

I intend to try it because I want to feel more present in the moment, and hopefully start getting enjoyment out of interacting with people and doing things. However, if the drug is going to just make me calmer and more withdrawn/lethargic/okay with being indifferent, I would be hesitant to try it. I was also reading about how people stay on it for years, and I don't think that's something I want to do.",15Apr2018,2

Three rules for handling bipolars in the acute phase of the disease

german damsel:""
For some years I have been active in the bipolar self-help forum of the DGBS as a writing sufferer and member of two other bipolar sufferers, my brother and my father. 

Relatives, who during a phase of their relatives or, often even more dramatically, their life partner, desperately find that all the rules of living together and all their behavioral strategies of daily life can suddenly become invalid, are often looking in the forum for answers that books, brochures, doctors or even social workers could not give them.

How should I handle my affected partner/relatives correctly if they are in an acute phase of illness?


Sooner or later, almost all relatives who do not want to sever their relationship with the affected person are confronted with this topic and it is a great challenge, which is often mastered more badly than quite well for years or even decades.


Especially in a current crisis, relatives often lack clear guidelines on how to behave, while descriptive information about the disease itself is relatively easy to obtain. 
Often there is something like a desire for a manual, an ""operating manual"" for the mentally ill, and not just for information about the nature of the disease. One does not automatically result from the other. 


Usually there is great uncertainty and the fear of doing something wrong when the family member has to deal with an acute phase for the first time. Co-dependent communication structures can develop quite quickly and sometimes persist for decades to come.


The issue therefore also concerns the mental health of all those involved.


Over the years, I have written the following text more or less unchanged, more or less unchanged, to relatives seeking help. It is the quintessence of what I can write after 45 years as a relative and 25 years as an affected person about functioning communication in phases of illness. 
In general, these are very good communication rules, but they offer great advantages for both parties, especially when talking to an acutely mentally ill person, and can thus also substantially improve the relationship between the two...


Although the text deals primarily with communication with maniacs, which is once again a particular challenge, these rules also apply to all other phases of illness, whether depression, schizoaffective phases or even mixed states.


In extreme conditions, ""completely normal"" communication with maniacs is often no longer possible at all. But even in mania, when the zenith is exceeded, the manic recognizes that he isolates himself socially through his behavior, that he can sometimes no longer communicate in an understandable manner and is lonely in his condition, can give a general ""real"" readiness to talk (not monologues), or also longing for the ""completely normal"" conversations.


Sometimes, in a helpless way, a desire for normality even sounds through the manicurist. He does not choose his mania specifically and when it runs, it can also subjectively become a curse, especially if dysphoric conditions occur. It is incredibly frustrating for the manic that nobody can keep up with his pace, that people get afraid of him, whom he actually loves, and above all, not to understand himself any more. 


He often feels very alone and misunderstood. He can never really convey to healthy people what he really feels, yet he often has an irrepressible longing for it, for he has feelings of freedom, grandeur, all-encompassing truth, importance that are triggered directly by his brain chemistry and cannot be compared with anything that ""normal"" people feel.

Even with drugs it is not really possible to get to what a manic can really experience in his nervous system. There are manics who can calm down with cocaine, a highly euphoric stimulant, because the mania is able to create much greater euphoria and excitement in them, and they only feel an effect when paradoxical effects start to appear again in the overdose range. 


It is important to know that it is impossible to understand what a manic or psychotic feels, but with a little empathy you can grasp at least partial aspects, such as being driven or sometimes helpless when it comes to communicating with others. 


A common problem when talking to a manic is that he thinks and speaks very quickly, that he loses the thread and continues with something completely different, that his thoughts turn over and he can constantly change direction in conversation.



He doesn't choose that. 


This is part of the intoxicating effect of mania. There is little point in constantly pointing out or reprimanding him, for a manic, his own thoughts usually seem completely logical and correct in themselves.


I sat at a loss countless times at the end of a conversation in the mania when my conversation partner broke off the conversation because it had nothing to do with the initial topic. It is often not in the power of the manicurist to follow clear red threads. It's part of the disease. A manic is often extremely distracting, self-centered or even nervous, and although the behavior can be extreme, it often happens without him noticing it. 


There was a party when I suddenly found myself completely alone in the room at the end of a conversation/sentence. Allegedly I had been told several times without success that the party was over and everyone had left. Two hours before... You often experience similar things in mania. 

The following 3 basic rules are intended for conversations with manikers, but generally offer many advantages for communication with relatives and partners. 


One: Be friendly.

This is essential. Friendly in the sense of ""like a friend"". What would a friend do? 

    A friend always shows his willingness to help. 
    A friend talks to me with honest interest, at eye level. 
    A friend listens carefully and asks if he doesn't understand something.
    A friend is not dependent on me, he always stands benevolently at my side and honestly tells me his opinion. 
    A good friend tells you the truth, even if it's unpleasant. He would never lie to me just so he wouldn't upset me. 

This rule must also be observed in the second meaning of ""friendly"". Before you become unfriendly yourself, be sure to end the conversation, but with a short explanation and the announcement that you will be available for another conversation if you are less excited. If you lose your temper, become angry or unfriendly, the meaningful conversation is over anyway.

There's nothing wrong with that. This can happen, especially when talking to a person in an acute mania. But then it's time to withdraw from the conversation until your excitement is gone. 
This can also simply be a very short spatial separation, e.g. one goes briefly into another room to calm down (announced).

A psychologically healthy relative has no chance against the intensity that a manic can develop in anger, against his sometimes irrepressible will and his exaggerated self-confidence. It is simply not an honest fight, the manic is often very strong in advantage due to his brain chemistry, the lack of critical ability and the pathologically increased self-confidence during excitement and strife. Therefore, in any case in the event of a dispute immediately interrupt the conversation, the dispute is in no case to be won. The escalation is the end of the conversation. If you can no longer be friendly, the conversation must be interrupted or ended. 

Two. Be honest. 

Therefore, I can only warn against censoring myself too much just to ""not upset"" the manicist. If he's in an aggressive mood, there's nothing that won't upset him.

If he notices that the person he is talking to is lying to him because he is afraid of him and his reaction, this can make the situation considerably worse. In most cases, a manic doesn't want to cause fear in others, at least not if he really wants to have a conversation. But he wants to be taken seriously. (Only exception: He's very happy and joking right now...)

I was often so excited by the fearful, co-dependent way of always paying attention to how I would react and then adjust my own communication, which my mother had internalized with my father over the decades, that I was seriously exhausted and ill for at least one to three days after a family Sunday afternoon visit. Even when I was in drug therapy. In fact, my partner noticed this much more clearly than I did, I was already much too used to this kind of conversation.

Such co-dependent communications are often manipulation attempts that are intended to immobilize the manikin. And that is anything but healthy, neither for the family member nor for the person concerned. First of all, it doesn't work absolutely as desired and secondly - is there anyone who likes manipulation that goes on unconsciously?

This has nothing to do with kindness or honesty, it's a level where it's constantly permeating: ""I'm afraid of you."" And that means, conversely, ""YOU are frightening"" - but without saying it. 

A maniker notices when you just ""talk to him at his mouth"" so as not to provoke him. And that can be unbearable. A good friend would never do such a thing. So it's important to be honest.

A manic has disturbances in perception and in thinking, it is difficult for him to see reality. However, the family member is able to do this and it is imperative that he or she remains in reality. Simply confirming a maniac's world view means aggravating his illness. One could just as well call the rule ""Stay authentic"" or ""Stay recognizable as a person"". 
3. Be consistent. 

If you want to talk to a manic in a healthy way, you have to be consistent.

A manic is only capable of consequence in very very few cases, since thoughts are constantly in motion and constantly open up new possibilities to him, so that he can only rarely consistently maintain a topic.

So consequence is the task of the relative. That means what they say you should be serious.

If conflicts are raised in the discussion, the member must consistently represent his opinion. Even if this means that escalation occurs and then the call must be terminated (see the first rule).

When you make your own limits clear to a manic, you automatically give him something he can rely on, because he himself simply can no longer see and correctly judge the limits of his actions. When the other person then says: ""Stop until here and no further"", this is a clear message that can be understood. Even as a manicurist. However, the consequences of crossing the border must be clearly announced in advance.

Example: The relative says in an emerging quarrel situation in which the manic announces that he wants to riot out of anger: ""If you break something here with me and rage, I will call the police"".
Or for example on the phone: ""If you threaten me with suicide now, I am afraid for you and I am forced to call for help"".

Or: ""If you continue to insult me as you are right now, I will break off the conversation.""

This means that you have to communicate your limits clearly as soon as they are crossed, you have to say what the consequences are, and you have to be consistent when it comes to further border violations. The manic must be able to rely on one being honest and serious with him. This sometimes has serious consequences.

This is the practical application of the so-called demarcation, which is repeatedly given to relatives as advice.

Last but not least, ""staying consistent"" also means that these three basic rules must be observed in any case. If you notice that you can no longer keep to one of these rules, you have o end the conversation. 


Apart from the fact that these are very simple rules that should actually apply to all friendly conversations, they can improve the conversations and the relationship between the relative and the person concerned in general very much - especially in the long run. They prevent co-dependence and create clarity for all parties involved.

Honest, friendly, consistent, that's easy to remember and sounds very simple.

But it's not! It takes a lot of practice and especially as a family member you have to check yourself again and again. It is often very difficult to follow these simple rules.

But there is actually no alternative if you want to get along with a person who is constantly going through phases, whether out of a lack of insight or because therapy and medication can only help him insufficiently or both. Unfortunately, everything else usually ends unhealthily - both for the person affected and for their relatives.""

64,Has anyone on here had to quit working and go on disability for mental health issues? I would love to hear about your experiences...,15Apr2018,3
66,"I dunno if this is the place to put such a thing but basically my doctor can't book me in for a refill for a few days and by then I'll have run out of medication by then. However somewhere around this time this year (May/April 2018) the doc was thinking of taking me off these meds. But I read you're supposed to ween off them and not quit cold turkey. But since I'm rapidly running out of the drugs, I'll have to quit them cold turkey. Is it safe to do so? Please and thanks for help!

PS the drug is PROZAC FLUOXETINE

67,"So I had intended to end my life on Friday night following the last performance of the band I started 1/3 of my life ago. For the last nearly 10 years it has been a huge part of my identity and now it is over. I feel like I've lost my family. Which is when I'd turn to my wife and my best friends...but wait, there's a problem.

My wife is trying to be supportive, her masters is in occupational health and she's studied about mental illness but never experienced it first hand. She does not get that I can't just snap out of it, she has told me that I just need to try harder to be well. She's supposed to be monitoring my meds under order from my GP however she didn't notice the 5 boxes of prescription pain meds that went missing from in front of the mirror on her dressing table.

As for my friends, there are 2 that I can talk to, usually about anything, but they have their own dramas and issues in their lives and I feel like I am being selfish by adding more to their burdens. So when I am feeling at my lowest, and all I want to do is talk to them or see them, I feel like I can't message them because I'll just be getting in the way. Also, one of them is female and my wife is jealous, so that makes it even more difficult to talk to her, but she is really my lifeline so I don't know what to do about that.

Thanks for allowing me to vent, I suppose I don't really have a question or anything, I just have nobody else to bother with my thoughts without feeling like a burden or feeling judged.

Anyway, goodnight Reddit xXx",15Apr2018,6
68,I don't think I can trust anyone. Every minor thing stresses me out so much and I can't bottle my emotions anymore. My family probably only puts up with me because they're my family and I fucking hate to hear people make up positive things about me to compliment me because I know they're all just lies. I hate when people try to comfort me when I panic. I tried to go to a therapist but all they did was fake friendliness and lie to try to make me feel better. I hate being around people. I just want to be alone but i can't be . Nothing makes me happy. Everything feels empty. I don't know how to stop it. I don't know what's going on. I feel like I'm melting. I'm so tired of everything. ,15Apr2018,1
69,"So long story short,
I’ve been working at a private Diagnostic Center for a few months as a psych tech- as I am planning on entering a PhD program soon. I really was excited to work here but the more I do the more troubled I am. I am going to make a quick list of some of the concerns I have and hopefully figure out if it is or isn’t malpractice, and if so, who to talk to.
1) a majority of the ‘therapists’ have a masters in social work- not clinical- and are assessing/diagnosing a majority of the patients. They reference the DSM-V but of what I’ve seen, they generally don’t know how to properly use it. 
2) many of the patients are coping with suicidial intent/drug abuse/ rather minor stuff in the grand scope of mental disorders, yet, almost all of the patients are prescribed and given drugs (told they must take them or certain privileges are taken away). Yet, the prescription is done by a Nurse practitioner (I know they have presc privilege) but rarely meets with the patients and so the nurse pretty much prescribes based on the assessments and directions of the ‘therapists’ I described in 1. 

Hell, there’s other- more nuanced- issues I could discuss. Such as lying, telling them they’re undergoing ‘marijuana withdrawals’, making jokes about certain ones have ‘daddy issues’, and other ludacris nonesense. But the two issues above are some of the worst. The issue is, they have two Clinical Psycholgists and two Psychaitrists there who work with the more severe cases they see (such as schizo and high level OCD) but they generally aren’t present or involved in the diagnosis of a majority of the patients.

I’m just concerned and need my mind eased, or help in making things right.",15Apr2018,2
74,"A friend of mine has issues of self esteem, she seems to believe that she's constantly fucking things up between us, she's very sweet and she's never done me wrong once, how can I help her understand that she hasn't done anything wrong, and that I'm not upset with her? Just telling her those things hasn't seemed to work and I'm blundering around in the dark here, any advice would be greatly appreciated",15Apr2018,1
78,"Hi folks,
So for background, I’ve got relatively mild OCD and anxiety, it’s no as where near as severe as other people’s but it still really effects me. I’m seeing some people and I’ve been on Sertraline for a wee while now, slowly but surly getting there.

I function somewhat well day to day with everyday tasks but I just can’t handle traffic lights if I’m driving. I know it sounds stupid believe me enough people tell me but if I’m driving through a junction and the light goes amber I flip, I need to drive that stretch of road, go through that junction until I do it perfectly. Today for example a 5 minutes drive turned into a 20 minute drive because the traffic lights I go through kept changing to amber when I was going through them so I had to do it perfectly (until they stayed green). It’s exhausting, I know I’m being daft - I tried to stop myself turning around and driving the road again but I just couldn’t stop thinking about that amber light, I couldn’t stop obsessing about whether or not I’d mistaken it for a red and caused a crash, I couldn’t stop thinking about a million different scenarios involving that damn light. It upsets me so much but it’s all I can think about.

I’ve got several different things which I obsess over but this is just the one that’s really getting to me right now. Sorry for the vent guys just had to get it out.

Tell me how you are all feeling? How was your day?",15Apr2018,2
