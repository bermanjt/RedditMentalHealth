0,"I have posted multiple times on this sub about being suicidal. I am scared that I may ""rage quit"" in a sense and kill myself because I make rash decisions and have had a terrible time lately. I have been able to be in better spirits because of the holiday season (sadly, I am very materialistic and greedy). I feel like after the holidays I won't have anything to look forward to and will find the courage to do it, so my question is, should I mention this to my therapist? And if so, how? ",23Dec2018,1
1,"It happened to me at BIDMC/DMH/MMHC sponsored PREP here in Boston.

https://www.cepacma.org/programs/

I was talking to a local Irish townie chick, and I said chick. The 2015 supervisor clinical psychologist at the room who overheard our vis-a-vis conversation said that we ‚Äúfeminist language here‚Äù. Obviously I didn‚Äôt have the rhetoric or emotional energy to challenge that. Like is ‚Äòchick‚Äô really that abrasive? The chick didn‚Äôt seem the mind nor did she raise any complaints. Literally I was interjected mid-conversation. üò§

Then you have yuppie Italian trainee saying ‚Äòshe‚Äôs a Boston girl‚Äô then the other client asked ‚Äúoh what neighborhood ‚Äúshe was like she‚Äôs from Dedham.‚Äù Like that‚Äôs disrespect to actual non-princess Boston chicks. You living a 45-min drive home from Boston doesn‚Äôt constitute you as a Boston chick. üò§

Anyways just my two cents using programs here in Boston. üòî",23Dec2018,1
2,"After a sleepless 11 hours flight, I arrived in Vietnam at 6am. My partner - an experienced traveler- strongly advised me not to go to sleep til 9-10pm. 
So we walked and did touristy thing. It was one of the worst day of my life.
I am already an over sensitive, anxious, over thinking type of person but yesterday was something else. Everything my partner said hurt me to the core, the doors of hell were opened so many times in my head. So much I thought we were doomed forever at least 5 times for stupid shit such as him not laughing at one of my joke, etc. So I put him through the silent treatment, I poured, we fought, we got stuck in heavy heavy heavy discussions.
I felt so apart from him, so inadequate the thoughts were racing through my exhausted brain.. 
I am fully aware all of this has no ground whatsoever. I just react badly to jet lag.
I only managed to sleep for 5:30 hours and  I still feel so tired. I can feel the same shit happening again today. 
How can I deal with being exhausted better ? How to not destroy my relationship just because I am a cranky sleep deprived baby ?
Help !",23Dec2018,1

4,"I‚Äôve had a really horrible, stressful day. My boyfriend flies home today for Christmas for a bit, so I drove him an hour to the airport and then drove back myself. When I got home, I had a text from my roommate to me and my other roommate. He is messy, never cleans up after himself, especially beard hair on the bathroom counter. He texted telling me to put dishes in the dishwasher and take out the trash. I do this once every week (ish), when my other roommate doesn‚Äôt. I texted back after cleaning the kitchen and bathroom telling them that I cleaned but they need to clean up after themselves. The male roommate came into the bathroom while I was cleaning, and yelled at me that it‚Äôs me who never cleans, and him who always does. My other roommate (we also have a bad relationship), texted back something long and bitchy about how I need to get over myself. She‚Äôs petty and makes stuff up, it‚Äôs like living with two babies. I‚Äôm so angry and frustrated. It‚Äôs been about an hour, and I‚Äôve been texting my therapist and I‚Äôm in my room (that doesn‚Äôt have a lock). It‚Äôs been so frustrating and I‚Äôm so mad and sad and just so high emotion, even after trying to calm down. I would appreciate advice on this if you have any, please. ",23Dec2018,1
5,"No, this is not the typical heartbreak story. Love ruined my brain, not my heart. I have recently come to the conclusion that I am addicted to being in love and it's ruining my life. It all started four years ago when I fell in love for the first time. It was inevitably the most wonderful and intense experience I've ever gone through, and it lasted about a year. Only later did I find out that we were really so much more different than I first thought and that I was starting to fall out of love. The first trauma consisted of the persistent stress that I was feeling because I didn't know how to explain to him that I didn't love him anymore without hurting him so I just kept it as a secret for another year and pretended that everything was fine while it was obviously killing me on the inside because I was unhappy with the relationship. But the biggest trauma was falling out of love so suddenly and so unexpectedly when my brain and body were so used to being in love and being basically drugged up with hormones for a year. It sucked. I had actual physical withdrawals because I was constantly craving the high, the intense high of being in love, and it wasn't there anymore. That was the moment when I completely stopped enjoying life, because love WAS my life. When I lost the high, I found myself unable to enjoy anything else because I was actively comparing every single experience to that of being in love, and everything else paled in front of love. Think of it as some kind of substance addiction, such as heroin for instance. Many people who've done heroin once reported that no matter what they did, nothing ever compared to heroin so that's when they realized they were addicted. This was my case with love/infatuation, but worse. You can buy drugs, even if they're difficult to obtain sometimes, but you can't buy love and you can't really hack your brain to fall in love with someone. So I quickly became suicidal because I couldn't have my ""drug"" of choice so I didn't want to live anymore. I started skipping classes, drinking, abusing pills and masturbating compulsively. Nothing ever came close to being high in love. Nothing. I've done various drugs and never became addicted to them. Why? How is it possible not to become addicted to drugs, even when you're feeling this way? Because drugs weren't as good as love, that's the answer. The drugs weren't intense enough to simulate the same experience so I eventually gave up on them too. In fact, I just stopped using drugs and quit cold turkey and never had any withdrawals or negative symptoms, not even cravings. Meanwhile, 4 years later, I'm still addicted to love, searching for possible romantic interests in everyone I meet and basically not being able to enjoy anything including hobbies, activities, past passions and just living and existing. Nowadays I'm either in horrible pain OR completely numb, there's no inbetween. When I'm not numb, I can sometimes develop new obsessions for things instead of people (how I used to). For instance, during these 4 years, I've had short phases of obsession with things such as TV shows, bands, hobbies and just random interests, and whenever the obsession fades, the withdrawals start again and life goes back to hell. Basically, to make it brief: I can only feel happy whenever I'm obsessed with either someone OR something. When I'm not obsessed, I'm numb to everything. I'm so tired of feeling this way and I don't know what to do. I'm really looking for advice from those who know how I feel, because I don't know how long I can go on like this. What should I do? (I've tried countless medications, I'm in therapy and I have support but it still doesn't seem to help) ",23Dec2018,1
6,"2:43 am and I'm drinking my bourbon whiskey while self-harming. I'm realizing that in a twisted and distorted way, I like being hurt or depressed/sad. I can't explain it really. But it's become so familiar that this feeling has become home in a way. Even though I often complain about feeling like shit, in a weird way, I do enjoy this self-torture.

7,"I just have a constant overwhelming fear that I'm not good enough, especially when working alongside those who have worked there for years. Every little mistake I make dwells in me and accumulates till I just feel like I want the shift to be over and go home. It's my first job in retail and I understand it's tough, especially around Xmas time, but I still just can't find a way to relieve the pressure.

I've been told before I tend to be a perfectionist but my point of view is that if you can't do the job, there's someone better that can, and the company I'm at aren't afraid of just replacing weak links. Does anyone else feel this way? Are these thoughts common?",23Dec2018,1
8,"I always feel like when I‚Äôm talking to people I‚Äôm putting on an act or a different mask to please them or get them to like me. I do it subconsciously of course, I‚Äôd never want to be fake to people I care about but I don‚Äôt know how to stop doing this or why or even who I am without the mask.

I have multiple different friend groups and I feel like I‚Äôm a wildly different person in each of them; in one I‚Äôm the vulgar sexual one, in another I‚Äôm shy and reserved, in another I‚Äôm the clueless idiot. Even when I‚Äôm alone I feel like I‚Äôm just mirroring my current strongest friendships‚Äô personalities and Doing what I subconsciously feel will make people like me.

I want to stress that I don‚Äôt do it consciously! I don‚Äôt even know who I am when I take off the mask and it‚Äôs scary because I know that this isn‚Äôt even a recent thing- yes I‚Äôve realised I‚Äôm doing it recently- but when I look back to when I was a child I was still mirroring my friends personalities and people I‚Äôve seen on tv.

9,"Weirdest, most intense experience. Was this even sleep paralysis?

As a little bit of history, I have experienced sleep paralysis in the past, multiple times, but it was never like this before. It was always very fast and very easy to snap out of. I would hear voices or whatever, and I would open my eyes, see some weird creature for a split second, and then snap out of if. This was different. I have had a bit of a change in sleep schedule lately, as I have switched to overnights. But it has been about a month since then, and I'm used to is, as I always stay up late, anyway. I always sleep for like 4 hours, spend time with my girlfriend until she goes to work, then nap for another 2 or so hours to make up for waking up so early. These problems just started this week, so I don't think that is what is causing it.

1st experience happened like 3 days ago. I took a nap in front of my TV in my chair. I got a strange tightness in my chest, and my chest hurt, like my heart was having problems or something. I opened my eyes a couple times, saw the things in front of me, they were blurry and I don't remember much. It basically felt like I was half asleep and just trying to snap out of a daze. After a bit of this, I snapped out of it and was fine. No more pain, and everything was normal.

I always have a weird feeling of fear or something along with it, but it's really hard to explain because it isn't normal fear. Just now was the weirdest one. This is my 2nd experience.

I was laying there, and I was trying to sleep in my bed, and next thing I know I'm feeling the chest pains from before, but also I'm feeling tingly all over my body. I open my eyes, and everything looks fairly normal but it looks scary for some reason. And then, I start seeing the TV and Playstation on (it wasn't before) but it's still super dark. The PlayStation started making really weird distorted sounds that the PlayStation literally can't make, and I could have sworn my girlfriend told she didn't like it and to turn it off, but she wasn't there. I kept drifting in and out of hearing the noise and feeling the tingling and pain, and I kept getting more pain and tingling, as well as these weird head jolt things I will describe at the end of the post. Every time I focused on the noise or even thought about the PlayStation or something, they would get stronger. Then it faded a bit. I thought I opened my eyes, woke up or whatever, and then closed them again, but then I started hearing static instead of the weird PS noise. Then, the TV and PS was all off. I thought I opened my eyes, I could see the controller charging light that I keep on the dresser and everything else. I thought that I was out of it, because the chest pains started to come and go in weird waves. But then I started hearing weird noises again, but different ones. It sounded like radio frequency, you know the weird high pitched scifi sounding noises you hear in movies with robots, or aliens? And it repeated the same few tones over and over. I felt more tingling everywhere. Then I thought I opened my eyes again, and I remember trying to get up to turn the light on, but I couldn't move, and then I started sliding and rotating on the bed, as if something was moving and pulling me. I fell over the side of the bed as if something dragged me by my ankles, and was on the floor sitting up against the bed because of the way I fell. But when I opened my eyes again (another fake ""awakening"") I was laying on my back in bed, which was weird because I was on my side before. And then I felt the same intense tingling and fuzziness all over I felt when I was dragged off the bed. But this time it seems to close in on me, and I started floating upwards with my eyes closed. I was smiling the whole time, but I wasn't trying to, it was like I was being forced to. Like I couldn't control my lip muscles. I kept floating, and the frequency noise kept getting louder and more scary sounding. I felt like I was getting closer and closer to something. Then suddenly, I was lowered back down into bed. I falsely opened my eyes again and I searched for my phone, grabbed it, and opened it to try and use it as light to see the bedroom light switch. When I opened it, it was on the camera, but it was like I was seeing from across the room and saw myself sitting in bed in the dark. It wasn't on selfie mode, it was as if someone was standing over by the dresser, and the camera was seeing from that point of view. I reached up and hit the light switch, and it didn't come on. Instead I was laying back in bed on my back. The noises faded, and the tingling and the pain went away. I finally opened my eyes for real this time, and I was still laying on my side, like I was when I went to bed. I hadn't moved or anything. It was like none of that had happened.

It is also worth noting that when I try and sleep, and sometimes even when I'm awake if I'm tired, I get these weird pulses in my brain. Another person on here described them as head jolts. It is like I'm being shocked in my brain or something for a second and then it goes away. It's weird that I get them while I'm awake too, though.",23Dec2018,1

From the age of 6-7 i've heard voices, not like outside ones, but mentally. the older i've gotten they have become more distinct, to the point where they are almost becoming separate people.

[an old german man, usually accompanied by his grandson / my own voice / a young girl maybe around 7 or 8] 

these are the voices that are the most distinct. I'm not too worried about that though, i don't hear them often. There were brief moments in my life where i used to see bizarre shadows of people, i guess they were more like silhouettes.

I think i was around 10 ish when i'd get weird blackout moments. They'd often start by me feeling mentally (not physically) tired, then i'd start to lose feeling in my body, but i can still control what i do in that moment. It's hard to explain, but from there i guess my brain fizzles out and then i go blank for what could be minutes or hours. When i get out of that trance i don't always remember what has gone on since i was out. It used to be kind of scary.

Why am I inclined not to believe that their problems are real? Same thing goes for my own shit, I can‚Äôt stop telling myself things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not real‚Äù, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have problems‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just looking for attention‚Äù. But I know I‚Äôm not.

Not only are people the main source of my dread, fears, anger and hostility, I also have no desire to be in their presence, save my husband. At concerts or sporting events I can't focus on anything except my overloaded sensors. I'm in a bad mood. I wanna go home. Anytime I go anywhere, the goal is to go home. I can't wait to go home. I feel healthy and energized at home. Everything good is in my home. My hobbies are home, my animals are home... Everything I could ever want is home.

However, if other people feel this way, how do you cope with the crippling anxiety that people bestow upon you? How do you make it through work without incident... How do you go to the store?

26,"Hello, I am 16 and a female. Recently, it's been brought to light that I have a poor sense of self-control and trouble controlling my emotions. Two of which are the problem. My anger and sadness are really just one thing. I can't be sad without being angry too and vice versa. I could be sad about a death and still be angry for seemingly no reason. 

I've also been called neurotic being that I do worry over very little things constantly but they seem big at the time. 

My self-control problem is that when I do get angry I really can't control what I say and just impulsively say or do whatever comes to mind without thought. 

This one time I was with my friend in the library at our school and this one kid who likes to annoy me came up to me and started saying things that angered me and ""I told him to fuck off or I would be the shit out of him"" and so on and he threatened me and I started yelling at him to ""do it little bitch"" which is something I would honestly never do. But at the time I would have, when I get angry I feel bigger than I usually am and I tense up and really don't care about my consequences. Anyways being that I was with my friend he told me to calm down and actually physically pulled me away from the situation being that I wasn't really listening to what he was saying because I was so focused on what the other guy was saying. 

Situations like this have happened many times before when someone has threatened to do something to me and I say ""do it."" or something of a sort. It kind of just angers me that they would A.) say that and B.) Not do what they said. And when I argue with someone over basically nothing I also don't know when to stop so it's over when a third party intervenes or basically the other person gives up. 

It's just when I feel threatened I feel compelled to threaten that person too. a ""monkey see monkey do"" sort of strategy. ",23Dec2018,1
27,"Hi guys, I just wanted to see if anyone had similar experiences. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but they‚Äôre still working on a more correct diagnosis (I go away to college and I have seperate doctors) 

Anyways, I have been hallucinating since I was 14. At first it was a shadow person, but then they got so bad that I became extremely paranoid that these silhouettes transformed into these black birds that would watch me and plan to kill me. The voices were terrible and I often was told to do horrible things to myself and others. During this time (in high school- I am a senior in college now) I was sent to a mental hospital to be evaluated on several occasions because of my ‚Äúdisturbing actions‚Äù and behaviors. Before I graduated high school, I started to fall for this girl named Liebe. She was beautiful and kind in every way possible. I often went over her house and climbed trees, listened to her favorite music and took walks. When I got back from the hospital, she wasn‚Äôt there anymore. I asked people around school and there was never anyone named Liebe who went to our school. I called her number and it wasn‚Äôt in service, I even went to her house and the person answered and told me that they‚Äôve lived there for 10 years and there was no Liebe here. I couldn‚Äôt accept this and I was heartbroken. I missed her so much and cried a lot because I couldn‚Äôt talk to the wonderful girl I used to know. 

Years later I learned to accept that she was a hallucination, and never existed. I do see her from time to time when I forget to take my medicine and she always tells me she lost my number and has been looking for me for so long. I give her my number and I feel hopeful everytime that she‚Äôs real. But I never get that text she said she would send. I never got to see her since then and I still think about her from time to time. 

I still sometimes question my experience. If she wasn‚Äôt real then where did I go and what did I do when I was at ‚Äúher house‚Äù? Did anyone see me talking to myself? I have no recollection of what I actually did when I was with her or where I was ans that scares me. I‚Äôm so confused..

35,"So I know I have posted here a bit recently but a new development happened and I want to ask if I can recover from this. I am getting tired of living like this.

So for the past 2 weeks I have done nothing but lay in bed and thought. And thought and thought. And yet more thinking. All of it philosophical in nature. About numerous topics ranging from utopia, morality, god, the soul, meaning of life, evolution, whether life is suffering, social darwinism, you name it, I have probably obsessed over it. My parents are worried about me but everytime they try to talk to me I push them away because they will never understand my line of thinking and reasoning. I only eat and use the bathroom when neccesary. Otherwise I laid there and I did nothing but thank to the point of feeling dizzy. My mind going from one concept to another.

Recently I read two stories that really freaked me out and sent me reeling into thought. The first one is called The Egg by Andy Weir. http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html

The story is basically about how everyone is actually one soul in different bodies and everything about life is nothing but us hurting ourselves in life. The universe is an Egg and we will all become one singular god. This story scared the crap out of and made me convinced that is what the afterlife is going to be like. So many spirtual people something similar to be true and it scares me and now I feel like it is the truth. I kept thinking and analyzing about that line of thinking and came into fear that I have been enlightened. That I have seen the truth and there is no one else except me.

And then there was a 2nd story called Talking to God that I read https://www.fullmoon.nu/articles/art.php?id=tal This story is similar to the Egg and then talks about how humanity has to go through suffering and conflict and war in order to continue to evolve. And then when we reach peak evolution we will turn into a god. Stories like this scared me and have me thinking terrible thoughts like how war is good and we must suffer in order to advance ourselves. That Social Darwinism is the fastest way to advance ourselves. I tried reading counter arguments to these thoughts but I am convinced they are true.

I feel so depersonlized right now and so dizzy. Anxiety nearly filled me the entire day and now I feel nothing but these thoughts in my head 24/7. I have lost my moral compass and now believe that suffering is a good thing in my head and humanity must suffer more. Im too tired to argue against it. I feel like I have become enlightned or something. Guys is there any truth to my thoughts? Or am I delusional and this is just the depersonlization talking.

I used to think this was just the feeling of forgotten memories of intense sadness, however one time I was playing a game and while playing I got this feeling that I've been describing. I just dismissed it for five minutes until it started to turn full fledged and the welded chain kind of melted off and I just wept for no reason...

\[Other part\]: Sometimes I feel like I want to feel something but then I kinda feel like I want to embrace that emotion like maybe my brain is damaged and I just can't access that part of my brain because the pathways are blocked or something.

43,"Okay, so I have for a long while now struggling with emotions. I like to rationalize them, find out the root causes, better understand so that I can better deal with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My anger has always been something that I kept locked away as I hated the type of person I would become while angry, as that was not me, not who I wanted to be. In more recent months I've been more embracing myself, my insecurities, and trying to better understand my anger. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although it does scare me when I am angry, I am allowing it out more often and it is become less rage slowly and less stabby stabby feeling type anger then before. Actually allowing it out to process has been amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, when I am trying to process something that upsets me in an angry ""I am pissed off"" type way, my head starts to hurt a little, and my body starts to actually ache in a way, sides, limbs, all sorts of things while i just let it silently go off in my head till it calms down. And then within maybe an hour I am calm again. (Before I would just lock it up and feel fine, no more locking the anger up for me). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my main question is, for those of you who are more well versed in emotions and health of that way... 1. Is anger supposed to be so explosive, scary? Friends say it is normal when angry, especially the feeling of wanting to harm another but never acting upon it but, I don't know a part of me still wants to lock it back up again but I know that is not the right action. 2. Is headaches and body aches also part of anger? It only ever happens when I get rightly angry and let it out for a bit to get it out. Mostly just letting thoughts race and rage without doing or saying much, processing it that way instead of completely shutting the emotion down.",23Dec2018,1

47,"I was looking for a change of pace for my life. I moved in from another town to live with a long time friend. He was always a realy good friend, respectful and very tanlented. Since I moved here everything changed fast. He is always trying to control everything, doing things to push my limits (which I usually pretend to ignore), going from screaming to telling jokes in the blink of an eye and talking about how his treatment for depression is not working and he hates everyone.  


He is a semi-pro kart pilot (hobbie) and a musician as a profession, realy talented and treated by the community as a genious, to be honest. When we are driving around town he always throws his car in the direction of motorbikes to try to scare people and throw them off balance. He always screams when he does that and laugh histericaly, says he can't control himself and need to stop. He is already seing a psyquiatrist and takes medicine regularly, but I dont think this is making much of a difference since he says all the time about how he started to hate everyone else when he stop hating himself. About how good it would be to go around killing people. He does a lot of excentric stuff, this is just a small example.

I realy don't know how to help him. And I'm scared he will do something stupid at some point. Not with me, I can defend myself. But, there is no other way I can say this clearly so here it goes...

50,"My husband is struggling and I don‚Äôt know what to do to help him. He had a traumatic childhood due to his father, who was physically and emotionally abusive. He moved away from that situation and eventually joined the Marine Corps. After a deployment in 2009 (before I met him), he began struggling with PTSD and ended up drinking heavily. Since then, he‚Äôs sought help and at one point was put on antidepressants and medicine to help him sleep through the night. When we got our dog, it helped calm him a lot and he was able to stop taking the medication ‚Äî albeit he did this without consulting his doctor (this was a wrong step, and we recently discussed him trying to go back to the doctor, as discussed below).

He doesn‚Äôt drink as much as he did right after the deployment, but he still does drink just about every night ‚Äî never to the point of being drunk, but he thinks the alcohol calms him so he‚Äôll usually have about 8oz whiskey a night. He went to an alcohol assessment through the military and they told him that it does seem that he has a dependency, but they weren‚Äôt concerned with the quantity he was consuming. They essentially told him they didn‚Äôt see a need for him to do their program through completion and sent him on his way. 

Fast forward to the past few months. His new duty station is eating a lot out of him with how much stuff is broken in his command. He doesn‚Äôt work a too tremendous amount of hours but the work he does stresses him out a lot. This month, I had to travel a bit for my work and then we travelled to my family‚Äôs for the holiday ‚Äî I drove with our dog a week earlier, he just flew in yesterday.

When he got here, he told me he was not in a good headspace. He tried to take a few days off work while the dog and I were gone so he could relax, but work ended up calling him in anyways. He couldn‚Äôt sleep the whole time the dog and I were gone and he said that he was so tired that he felt on the verge of getting sick. He drank quite a bit on the plane to try to cope. He was beyond stressed out and said that there were points last week where he felt hopeless. 

He has already decided and we agreed that him getting out of the Marine Corps is the best way forward after this current contract ends. On his own initiative, he‚Äôs been trying to get an appointment with the medical center on base but they are giving him the run around and he hasn‚Äôt been able to set an appointment. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that he said he‚Äôll just have to go in there and basically demand to see a doctor for some of his physical ailments from military service, which is what he had to do one other time before where they wouldn‚Äôt set an appointment for him until he literally went in there and showed them how much he was bleeding. Late last night we also talked about him going back to doctor to help him with emotional health issues as well.

I feel helpless and I don‚Äôt know what to do to help him. If I‚Äôm being honest, it also takes a lot out of me too. I feel like military medicine is failing him horribly and I‚Äôm not sure if there are options for him to see a civilian doctor while he is active duty. He is a good, honorable man and it breaks my heart to see him struggle like this.

For anyone who has been in my husband‚Äôs or my situation, do you have any guidance?

My ten year old brother is very, very hard to deal with. He does have diagnosed ADHD, and were looking into a diagnosis of ODD as well. Every morning, usually around six or seven, he picks up his video game and almost immediately starts screaming at it and growling and yelling at the top of his lungs because it‚Äôs not going his way. But he won‚Äôt put it down. And my parents won‚Äôt take the games away when he gets like that. They just sit there and let him freak out. He also hypersensitive to absolutely everything.

He is currently trying different medications for the ADHD, and has been seeing s therapist for about a year. But to me, it‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs gotten a lot worse, and nowhere near better.

He brushes his teeth maybe five times a week, and when I try to get him to brush his teeth more often, he just says he's too tired to get back up from bed. He has no hobbies or interests besides working as an electrical engineer and playing video games. When anyone gives him advice, suggestions, or life help, he immediately shuts his brain off. He's extremely stubborn and thinks that nobody knows better than him, and I have never witnessed him taking someone else's words of wisdom into account. He's 24, and I have yet to see any interest in dating, meeting girls, or even getting laid, but this may be because he thinks girls are not interested in him because he's now obese and has lots of bacne. Last, whenever you ask him how something was or what he thinks of something, he only responds ""good."" There's no further conversation, opinions, or details. over the past couple of years, it seems his personality just disappeared, and he laughs much less now. When he was in school, his grades were excellent, so there was a lot of the typical failing that you see with depressed students. However, now that he's working, he always describes himself as tired and never wants to do anything after work, saying it's because he walks so much during work hours, which of the lame excuse for anything, because he's a young guy, and for his age, he should be filled with energy and tearing up the world, but he's honestly like an old man.

Is this depression? Apathy? Lack of confidence? Poor conversation skills along with laziness? Please advise. We're so worried. I know my parents are terrified that he'll kill himself one day, but I want to call them down. what's worse is that he won't even go to therapy for us to be able to assess him, because there's no interest, motivation, or care on his end, and he doesn't think there's anything wrong.

So Im going to work more on thinking about the things I'm saying, I don't feel like I always inherently feel angry, just confused and overthinking a lot.

My mood seems to change really quickly, maybe not outwardly, but in my head, I can have a habit of sort of always checking in on myself and how I am. So I feel like I'm not living in the moment, I'm just constantly thinking about other things.

Also, with work, I'm finding it hard to motivate myself, particularly if I don't have much to do, and I find myself clock watching and think I'm lazy. But I can be the exact opposite and put LOADS of time into it, but with that, I feel like it's an achievement and I want people to know the time I've put into it.

Because of my brain, a few hours after posting this, I'll probably wonder why the F I posted it in the first place and I just wanna tell my stupid brain to calm down.

I want to make a conscious effort to not be angry, I try and help strangers whenever I can and I want to continue doing that too and become the person I actually want to me (this last line even seems a bit dramatic to me now). ",23Dec2018,1

65,"Hello reddit, I'm a 16 year old teen from Germany and this is my first time posting on this site, so forgive me for any escapades.

So, one week ago I discovered a thought experiment titled ""Roko's Basilisk"" which deeply shocked me. I could't breathe normally ever since, and my knees have been feeling weak too. My normal thought processes were disrupted and I could barely eat anything out of nervosity the first couple days. But I think I'm slowly getting over it, but I'm still scared by the fact how much it has affected me. Before I discovered it, I was a bit insecure about my outer appearance (slouched back, thin arms) but I had such a huge anxiety attack that right now, nothing really seems to matter. I don't react to things the way I'm supposed to react to them. Like, I'm currently unable to be annoyed/amused by things that I usually find annoying or exciting. But what scares me most that after that event, I can't really recall feelings I had during certain moments anymore. I can perfectly recall those memories, but those feelings I associated with those moments seem to be gone, whether positive or negative. Please someone tell me that they aren't lost, they mean everything to me. I'm feeling alienated and not bound to reality anymore. I already consulted my school therapist, but I have to wait 2 weeks til I can see him again. I just want to normally spend time with my family, especially my grandparents. Who know, maybe these are my last days with them. ",23Dec2018,1

70,"Up until about a year and half ago I was always extremely nervous to talk people. I had a few friends throughout my life but I wouldn't consider any of them ""good"" friends, I've never had a best friend. Still when I meet someone new a lot of the time they'll introduce themselves and I'mbe too nervous to even respond, up until 2 years ago I would actually cry. Even around my parents and siblings I was afraid to be myself or talk to them a lot of the time, even though they didn't do anything bad to me. Now I've come out of my shell a lot and I have a girlfriend, we were set up by a friend of mine and her mom says she interested in me and is waiting for me to open up to her. The only reason I can think of is that I had a reputation as the ""bad"" kid in elementary school because I'd always get in school suspension for annoying my teachers by talking too much (the only elem. teacher I vividly remember is the ISS teacher), I only had one friend throughout most of elementary school and he was very autistic. Over the course of about one week in 4th grade I went from being very talkative and getting suspended 1-3 times a week to getting suspended 1-2 times a month, usually not for talking. I'm 16 now and I've gotten over a lot of my fear of talking to and being around people, the problem is when I try to talk to people I just dont know what to say, I dont ruminate or worry about it later but it frustrates me because I want to be able to interact with people. My pyschaitrist agreed that I am underdeveloped socially and I'm going to be in social training therapy or whatever, but I'm worried it may be too late because I didnt develop those basic skills as a young child. Even around my girlfriend who knows what's going on and I'm comfortable around I still find it hard to start or carry a conversation with her. I'm on antidepressants because I have suicidal thoughts because i cant see a successful future for myself so what's the point. I am confident in other areas, I can do non team sports pretty well, I'm pretty competent in most things, i just hate that I have an inability to socialize. When I overhear conversations I just dont understand how it can be so easy for people to communicate so well. Anyways, is it too late for me to develop socially, if not how long is going to take for me going to therapy to get to a point where I can communicate normally?",23Dec2018,1
71,"I have become aware that I am incredibly emotionally dependant on my partner and realising that this is not fair on them.

72,"I have stated all of my hardships in my previous posts, so there's that. This one is very specific. 

I am very afraid of summer.  I mean, very afraid. I get into a frantic and even more depressed state when I think about it or if I hear anything about it. Many say I had traumatic experiences on my last summer with the constant arguing and fights, my father's homophobic rant in a mall on my mom's birthday, my uncle's death and literally seeing him slowly die on his hospital bed, the heat, and my cancelled lessons. Not to mention my parents stopped taking me to therapy without telling me. Mostly because they wanted to dodge the family counseling offer because they said that they had no problems and that I was the only one that had something wrong with me. They left me in the dark with no support. They thought they were fine and declined family counseling offered by my therapist, who highly recommended it. I was so unhappy. And hurt. Very hurt. More unhappy than I already am being at home any time of the day. 

What makes it worse is that school is out at tat time so I have no one to talk to and to have fun with. That's the only time I get to see my friends. Winter and fall are the only times I'm a bit more happy and comfortable, and I plan on moving to a colder state. If I feel hot, I get flashbacks to last summer and start to almost have an anxiety attack or actually get one. It kills me. If the temperature rises, I have to run in order to try and blind my flashbacks but to no avail. I go crazy. I start snapping at people and become more hostile. 

Note, I am not a hostile or mean person. I'm the opposite: so when I get like that, it's like a completely different me and I get so mortified from it and apologize to anyone I snapped at. It's taking a toll on me. 

I'm currently on winter break and I don't like it. I am ""schoolsick"" And wish to be with my friends/teachers who act more like parental figures and give more support to me than my own biological parents would. My parents are incredibly biased and I never talk about my feelings and emotions to them because they'll just think I'm being dramatic. It makes me uncomfortable to think about doing that. It's not a ""teenager"" thing. I've felt this way even as a small child. I never felt comfortable around them. And growing up with all that tension manifested into my present possible depression, OCD, and anxiety, existential crisis, self-doubt, paranoid thoughts, almost done attempt at suicide (which I'll never do), etc. 

Makes me feel like a freak. I currently got out of a job due to these and I am still looking for another job that can help with it. I live in some godforsaken town with literally nothing in it and it makes me mad. I don't like it. I'm not allowed to work in the city which is 25 minutes away from us. 

I feel constantly dragged down and pressured. I want to leave and escape this hell. I'm currently fighting it and I am in a constant battle with my inner demons as well. I'm trying. I really am.

Sometimes it happens before my period, sometimes after (it has no connection to my problem). Also I have hypothyroidism which isn‚Äôt related to this as well.

After a month of feeling calm and happiness, I start feeling depressed, very anxious, suddenly shy and very weak. At these times I can‚Äôt concentrate, my memory and social skills become worse. All of my senses increase and everything I feel, see, hear become 100 times sharper/brighter. 

I start worrying about stupid things and overthink everything, check everything 100 times. At these times I feel like I‚Äôm a pro at faking emotions. I can‚Äôt sleep, I have insomnia, obsessive thoughts and I overeat. For example if someone criticizes me, I become very upset and think that I really am as bad as someone told me and punish myself for it.

I tend to fuck up every relationship I have because of lack of social skills and this condition. It‚Äôs like I have two completely different personalities: one that is normal and another, which experiences these symptoms and goes insane.

Also if I eat something with gluten, drink coffee, black tea, milk, take iodine and magnesium supplements my symptoms become a lot worse.

75,"First of all, yes, this is a throwaway. Secondly, yes, there will be a TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First off, we need to have this clarified: I am diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia, and I also show strong symptoms of other disorders. If you're having a hard time imagining what that is, just think of an all you can eat buffet but for mental illness.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Three months ago, I used to smoke and drank mostly soda (as in every day only soda). Now, things are not so great. Since I quit both things completely, I figured my body needed some time to adjust since I no longer have all that nicotine, caffeine and sugar in my body, that makes sense, right? The stress is absolutely tearing me apart and I can't sleep. Ironically enough, because I can't sleep it stresses me out even more because I need my routines. It is extremely important that my routines stay the same. When I get stressed, I sleep, but my brain chemistry is physically out of wack, so I have a very hard time sleeping (I used to have a functional routine where I had a 30 hour schedule (20 awake, 10 sleeping) instead of 24 as for normal people), and I end up sleeping for just a few hours. Then I wake up, and I can't go to sleep for a long time, and I get stressed even more. Well, that and tired. I'm just so tired at this point. I think I might be caught in some negative feedback loop where I just get more and more stressed. On top of everything it's Christmas, which is already a stressful time for me, and I'm at the end of my rope.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Originally, I started smoking in order to cope with stress. I didn't realize how much I actually needed that. At this point I'm considering to start smoking again, just to try and get things under control, but I figured I might want to explore other options first, which is why I'm here.

We've been thinking it's possible he sought mental health treatment based on a text conversation he had with this new girl he's been talking to from his job.

It's kind of hard to explain honestly.  I feel very..needy? I don't know. I hate opening up to people about it because then i feel so damn stupid after like, ""look how pathetic you sound!""

79,"I have serious issues that need to be addressed and I'm not sure how to go about. I'll try my best to keep this concise and only include information that I perceive relevant. 

I have always hated the act of speaking. Not only because of anxiety but due to immense pressure on my ear drum whenever I use my vocals. At around age four I tried to convey the issue to my parents but to no avail. The profound indifference became apparent during my first day of kindergarten. My teacher couldn't understand a single word I uttered and I couldn't concentrate on what she was saying because the classroom environment was chaotic and overwhelming. This lead her to believe that I was intellectually disabled and/or developmentally delayed. I got diagnosed with borderline cognitive functioning and severe developmental delays by ""professionals"". 

I remained at that elementary school til 4th grade while on an IEP. The work they expected from me was unchallenging and outright laughable. I would just stare a wall and day dream til dismissal. Every school teacher I've ever had believed I was retarded because I never communicated with others or gave personal output. I regrettably used my indifference as an advantage. Teachers expected less work from me and I graduated high school(homebound) doing basically nothing. So here I am today, 21 years-old, still homebound, untreated, pondering on the idea of going to a shrink with a letter explaining my situation. But how do I setup an appointment? My parents would most likely disown me if they knew I was capable of any high order thinking. Speaking is not an option for me. I can't string a cohert sentence together to save my life. I'm tired of living in my own head. I have profound problems that need addressed. I do nothing but read and pace around my room all day and I'm starting to feel symptoms of infomania. I literally have a insatiable craving for information but I can only retain about half of what I consume daily.

83,"I moved into a new apartment in September and got along really well with one of my roommates, but had an extreme clash with the other. I don't want to go into detail, but to put it in short, she would overreact when I asked for help to clean the apartment or do dishes. I swear to you I am being 100% honest, I asked as nicely possible even though I was stressed with schoolwork and a lot of aspects of my life. This person basically overanalyzed everything I said, accused me of attacking her and being inconsiderate of her mental health when what I was asking had nothing to do with that, and although I tried to be as understanding as possible, ultimately it sent me into panic and a mental breakdown because she said a lot of extremely hurtful things to me that were out of line. Not to mention I have a long history of anxiety &amp; depression and already struggle with self acceptance on a daily basis. The environment I grew up in was not very healthy either - my parents, although they mean well, have very controlling qualities and that contributed a lot to the development of my anxiety. 

So I talked to my therapist about this, and she thought that based off of the information I told her, this person \*seems to\* have some kind of a personality disorder, and only told me this so that I wouldn't take all the things she said about me seriously. I'm not in a place to diagnose my roommate though, so I'll just say she clearly has some serious issues with her mental health and tends to project her negative emotions onto others. (I do know that she dealt with an abusive family and has PTSD, so it makes sense). She used her PTSD as a reason to guilt trip me a lot, which sucked. As much as I want to call her an asshole and leave it at that, I know she wasn't doing all this intentionally and I do hope the best for her and that she works through what she needs to. 

I'm back at home for winter break right now and it's only been a few days, but I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. As I mentioned before my home environment isn't great. My mother is controlling in a different way, but also tends to blow tiny things out of proportion. If I put off a chore or a tiny task (although I literally JUST finished finals) she will blow it out of proportion, guilt trip me, and accuse me of being selfish among other things. This is what I've been dealing with for years, but the conflict with my roommate over the past few months has really sucked all the life out of me. I don't have a single ounce of energy left in me to deal with more of this...I feel so weak and powerless. All the work I've been putting into healing myself and building up my self worth seems to be falling apart. 

I've told my mother about the situation with my roommate but didn't really go into detail, and pretty much just told her that I had to take care of her messes, and would overreact when I asked for help. This morning I put off some chores because I was watching a show with my sister, and my mom offhandedly ""You're just like your roommate, you never clean up the dishes. I don't understand why you were complaining about her"". I know she doesn't know the full story, but that is such a fucked up thing to say. I literally started breaking down in front of her a few seconds after. Trying to forget all the things my roommate said about me is hard enough on its own and this literally tipped everything over. I've broken down like this hundreds of times this semester and I'm never usually like that, my depression is usually more of a numb/cold experience. 

I know that these assumptions my roommate and mom made about me aren't true, but it feels so true in my mind when it's been repeated to me so many times. Sometimes I don't know what's true and what's not anymore. If anyone has had a similar experience dealing with this kind of personality for a long time, please offer your input. ",23Dec2018,1

This might help me understand myself a little bit better, so I'll be thankful for answers. In addition, I can use this throw account to vent, since it's a throw. Gotta do that from time to time.

&amp;#x200B;

So... It's kinda hard to explain but I'll try.  

I usually find myself in one of three states: Depressed, ""high"", or empty.  

When ""high"" I feel like I'm unstoppable. I have rushing thoughts and I have more energy than usual. I legit feel like I'm better than other human beings for simply being myself.  

I may end up doing some ""crazy"" stuff from time to time. Some of the things I've done are breaking into a live show (with guards); rushing into a church to blast heavy metal and legging it; igniting stuff on fire (I like how the flames look and feel, I can stare at it for hours, but I mostly do it because I know it's illegal and it makes me feel the adrenaline. I even posted one of these on this site), stealing small stuff, etc. Not only ""bad"" stuff though, I also tend to give more of myself in conversations or fun activities.  

When I do that, I feel really confident. This feeling fades away after the rush though. In that state, I also tend to find simple things a lot more amusing, and I may end up laughing a whole lot. If something doesn't goes my way when I'm like this, I get angry.  

I don't know how long it lasts, I don't measure, but when I'm like that, there are peak hours and less intense hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about the ""other side of the coin"", depression. It comes back once in every few months, and it makes me feel really down. Like the other state, with peak days (it usually lasts longer than ""high""). Yes, I can end up crying just over my thoughts, cutting, burning myself, and such. I even write sad / suicidal poems (sometimes I highlight words with my blood, no real explanation for why). I hide it all from my environment though, so no one knows about it yet.

&amp;#x200B;

The above states are ""the peaks"", not how I usually am. In most days, I'm pretty empty of feelings. I'm the logical and quiet type when I don't feel any of the above. I graduated with top grades in classes like math, physics and such. Also, I ended up with a perfect score in PE because I train a lot (according to my blood test, ""too much""). I also want to add that my childhood wasn't perfect. In summary, I started to feel self hatred at the age of 10, so to cope with it I ended up training in some hellhole with a mental coach who hit and tortured me physically and mentally for years. I didn't realize it wasn't ""fine"" and I thought it's the only way I can save myself. He later ended up stopping doing these things because of the involvment of the law.  

This made me turn from a good and moral kid, who always wanted to be the sacrifice to make others feel better, to a vengeful fuck who burns his neighbor's electric circuits just because they didn't park correctly.  

I also want to add that I always had trouble understanding things as others see them. My parents always tell me that ""I think differently"", and I do lack common sense according to friends / family.

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize: I'm lost.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, but I needed to vent a bit.  

As far as my research went, there is the posibility that I'm bipolar with sociopathic tendencies, or a schizophrenic (because of the fact that my reality is a bit different from other's). However, I'm not convinced that this is true.

89,"I'm part way through a Masters degree and despite thinking throughout my entire life that academia is the place for me, it's chewing me up. All it seems to be doing is eroding whatever delicate personal foundations I had beforehand. Spending nights crying myself to sleep, doing what I can to avoid sobriety on a MINIMAL budget, hell, I even started cutting again (it seems to be the only thing that actually vents the steam properly). If I do avoid these maladaptive coping mechanisms, living healthily as it were, all that happens is a build up of tenseness, of acute angst that gets in the way of everything else and stops me form being able to focus on anything properly. And I'm not exactly unhealthy either: I cycle to uni every day, swim a couple of times a week, sleep pattern (attempted sleep pattern), 5 a day, balanced diet, visited the GP the other week and I'm waiting on responses from several counselling services. So I feel like it should all be working, but it isn't. 

And this is years old, all that seems to be happening is as the years go by, 27 soon, things get harder and harder. Falling asleep is harder, being a social creature is harder, not taking everything so, fucking, personally is harder. People have to walk on eggshells around me or I get aggy as fuck so I tend to just avoid people, which I know won't help, but otherwise they have to put up with all \[gestures at one'self\] this. 

And so it comes to the Masters degree. I put my heart and soul into these assignments to get okay grades. I try revising but it all bounces off and the barriers continue to erect themselves. All it seems to be doing is teaching me just how average I am. Which, on paper, is nothing bad, but my entire academic life has had a focus on the ""you seem to be more academic than some others, why not go for a PhD"" vibe, and when you have supervisors telling you you won't make the cut, or grades that show just how unexceptional you are, it drags you down.

I mean, it drags ME down, I'm sure other people don't see it as the end of the world as I apparently do. Which is the problem; my thoughts and behaviours, all aimed introspectively at myself, take huge steaming shits on anybody else getting the same grades. If I'm being such a drama-queen about mine, what distinguishes my 60% from anybody else's 60%? Why do I have to be such a cunt (secretly and indirectly, I suppose) to those around me? Why can't I accept averageness like others do? Do I quit the Masters if it's causing so many issues or suck it up and carry on? Where's the line for giving up and when do I cross it? When I look to my Dad and his PhD, I feel shame. When I see old/ex friends receiving their PhDs, shame. The fact my girlfriend has to know me, shame, the fact I even tried a Masters, shame, the fact I'm complaining here instead of just fixing things, SHAME. Do I even have a right to say things? It doesn't seem like it, that's why it's taken nigh-on a decade (or whenever I found out about Reddit) to sign up and post something. I'm tired of all this, I just want all this to stop: to be able to go a day without eroding from underneath would be wonderful. 

Sorry to whine, it's just that it's way past the point where I'm questioning why I'm still trying, or why I'm still here. Still can't find a decent answer to that. ",23Dec2018,1

91,"We rarely fight, or have bad days, if we do we always end it with a heartfelt convo on a rooftop maybe with a joint. Our time spent together is filled with so much joy and laugher, true happiness in my opinion.  It was really just care free living, where both of us, could just get away from our troubled past, stressed out current situations, insecurities; and just be in peace and comfort in each other's company. We have been doing so strongly for 8 months now. Shes a heart of gold and is incredibly caring individual, to all her friends, family, and of course me. But the anchor in the relationship, and I feel luckyier than most, is... we just don't really have allot of time for each other. At the beginning I was maybe seeing her once every two weeks, then slightly more. But she told me she was giving me all of her free time, which to most wasn't alot, but everyone is different, I was still very appreciative. Both of us just wished we had more of it, she always felt a need to compromise on her needs or schedule to see me, but I feel like there is a hierarchy in that, she's a very selfless person. I mean I did so too, like study on the weekend  to see her throughout the week, or work nights to make sure I had enough to share dinner etc. But with her it was  like some inner conflict, like she LOVED spending time with me, and often rearranged her plans to make the visit longer, but did so under her own choosing, usually leaving her anxious about the time spent afterwards....the love was mutually, everything was reciprocated, incredibly strong, and we both sought to work things out, bcuz we honestly saw eachother dating one another for a really long time, we just clicked. Time just goes by super fast when we together, and super slower when were apart, making it incredibly hard for us at times, even emotional exhaustung. It's understandable relationships are hard work, and we're full time college students, she has a lot of extra curriculars, which happen to cover her universities tuition so it's just a lot of pressure, on that, from her family, depression, her constant anxiety. I just wish I could just do more for her, I wish she would have let me, even before this, I feel very helpless. She hasn't really been sleeping the past week, and she really does deserve this time to heal. I'm naturally very anxious too, especially about matters of the heart. I'm scared of the possibly of 3 months our hearts may just drift apart. I just don't understand the concept I guess, a break in a relationship is suppose to be a time to gather your thoughts, an opportunity to escape from the pressure of the relationship for a brief moment to discover how much our significant others actually means to us, how we feel about them, how we feel without them, our we feel about ourselves. Do people just don't take breaks, because they may be busy for the next few months,, is that normal? Do you think she is just letting me down softly, to initiate an actual break up, just to avoid confrontation? idk She said that ""i changed her life for the better"", that ""I'm perfect for her, my love was ""helping her with all the chaos in her life""  that she wants to come back a better girlfriend.""  And I believe her, Im just scared, about her and her well being, and even my own. This is alot on me too. I know it will be alright, but I just can't bare to stomach food rn , I'm incredibly anxious about losing her. I'm truly after her happiness, and I'll sacrifice a lot for this women, I can honestly say she is the love of my life. I just need some advice please help.",23Dec2018,1

93,"Throwaway because, yeah.

I switched my meds a few months ago, and in a lot of ways I feel pretty good. But there's been a lot of things going sideways in my every day life - with friends, family, just life in general, and I'm kinda at my wits end. I have coping mechanisms, but not for all this. I'm the scapegoat, everyone is upset at me for whatever reason (I'm the leader of a very large club, so whenever there are issues it's ""my fault"").

I'm the type of person that you'd never expect to be this messed up. I often think about how surprised people would be, or imagine their reactions, if I killed myself. I wouldn't; I have pets that depend on me, but ugh, it's hard to not let my thoughts go there.

Any coping tips? Suggestions? Is this just a product of the season + life generally being topsy turvy? 

Honestly, I just want to curl up in bed and never leave.",23Dec2018,1

95,"Hey guys, I don't usually use reddit but I've decided to make a post because I really want to get to the bottom of what's going on (and whether or not therapy is needed - I can't decide whether or not I'm open to it)

I have been a stoner for 3/4 years now, smoking weed daily and zoning out in my lawn chair for hours. Over the course of the past two years I've felt my emotional state and the control I have over my thoughts weaken - to the point where I don't even know who I am any more. I haven't had anything going for me in a while and I've used weed as a coping mechanism for my self - loathing and depression, but I'm worried that I may have caused some irreversible damage to my psyche - like I've travelled down the spiraling rabbit hole one too many times. These days when I'm sober and in public I can't stop myself from grinning for a split second, when I go to look at something/someone and focus on them my eyes twitch and roll up only for a moment's notice and when I'm by myself and think of something negative I often scrunch up my face in a (pretty horrifying) contortion. The first time this happened was after smoking weed on a camping trip and after 5 minutes I went into my tent, crawled under my sleeping bag and made fucked up faces for 45 minutes. That was 2 years ago. Now, I will get the most random, fucked up thoughts out of nowhere and a certain word or idea will trigger another thinking chain that compares my regretful past to my paranoid reality I've constructed out of my own doubt. I'm questioning everything - even things I've thought my whole life to be concrete and unshakeable. I'm so scared about what this could possibly be and I really hope I'm not alone in my experiences. I don't want to contribute this state of being to marijuana use solely, because I think other factors are at play (OCD, natural inclination to anxiety, social factors etc) but I'd really like some advice nonetheless. I can't connect with my family or friends because even small talk is becoming weird for me even though my family has always been as close as ever. I want to seize control of my life and be my own man (I turned 20 a week ago), but all these fears and negative thoughts I'm holding on to seem to have me running back to the bong every time. Apologies if this is a muddle of questions and not detailed enough, It's hard for me to articulate my thoughts into words at the moment. I would appreciate any help/advice given greatly and if there's any other helpful subs you think I could post this on that would be great too. Thank you very much",23Dec2018,1

Thoughts that I know I will not commit... while in my right mind. I‚Äôm scared that if I get drunk, I‚Äôm going blackout, and these thoughts are going to play out in real life, not just in my mind.

98,"My sister (21) is in Denmark on her own. Last week she spent the entire week calling my immediate family to warn us of our mother and her bad parenting. She was saying that she was put on this earth to protect my siblings by getting my mum arrested. Accusing my mum of all sorts of bullying. This week she is saying she loves my mum but hates my aunt. She says my aunt has been whispering in my dad's ear her entire life and that's she has caused all the troubles in our family. She says my aunt has spread rumours about my sister being a loose woman and doing all sorts of drugs 
to divert attention from her own children (my cousins) who are apparently much worse than my sister. My sister is now saying she was put on earth by God in order to kill my aunt. She accuses my aunts family of horrendous things like cheating, drugs, cheating and says they all had an agenda against her. When you speak to her she is talking with 100% conviction and even cries if we tell her she is not being normal.  

We grew up in a very toxic household where my dad has always been hyper critical. All of us have mental issues but she seems to have broken especially badly. My other siblings reacted to the toxic environment by becoming home bodies and using the internet/gaming as our escapes but she resorted to drugs, alcohol and guys. 

The issue is she is accusing people of realistic things. She is not talking about God speaking to her directly or aliens abducting her. It is realistic stuff like she believes my aunt hates her and that money was stolen from her by our  young cousins (probably happened) but it is affecting her more than it would a normal person, believing they are plotting against her.  It is just how she is reacting to this stuff that is strange. Not allowing herself to forget, and move on.

I've been researching and feel like it is early stage paranoid schizophrenia and maybe bipolar. Does anyone have any advice for helping her? Would going to prison for a bit be very bad? I've brought the idea of therapy coupled with medication but she was against happy pills.

If we let he carry on like this I feel that maybe her mental state will get worse and she will go to prison. Would prison be that bad? Maybe she could get treatment in there. ",23Dec2018,1

102,"...*my friend* has BPD, severe anxiety,  ADHD, but still feels like things are going unexplained  like frequent nightmares about various traumatic sceneries since childhood, a lot of irrational phobias (emetophobia, fear of being stalked/watched to the point where they can‚Äôt even make eye contact with people, mirrors only at night, and tight/crowded spaces), emotional detachment, severe anxiety, masochistic (right word?) thoughts, tendency to be defensive without realizing it, little to no attachment to things, constant unnecessary guilt and need to explain themself to others which can quickly get annoying but they are unaware when they do it, poor memory and often forgets what they‚Äôre talking about while talking about it, getting unnecessarily stressed out by some things like sounds or textures or being touched (in a normal/friendly way). They have no repetitive trauma they can remember but they have one hazy memory of physical assault as a child that may or may not have been sexual, they can‚Äôt remember. They avoided men a lot as a child, even family members, and are still somewhat distrusting of men. They have been emotionally abused by their mom (it increased tenfold after her brother killed himself due to mental illness) who seems to have borderline as well as she doesn‚Äôt realize the extent of her manipulation once it‚Äôs over and just goes back to normal as if nothing happened, but it was very rarely physical and they otherwise have good relationship with their mom when she isn‚Äôt having an episode.
