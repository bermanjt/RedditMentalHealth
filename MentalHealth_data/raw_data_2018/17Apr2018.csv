0,"I feel as though I'm only attracted to celebrities. Sure, I know people who are good looking, and yeah I've had pretty big crushes on people I know, but any time I've tried to go out with someone, I just can't. I find reasons to avoid seeing them again, I get too nervous and anxious at the thought of being with them, and I cut it off right away. But when I think about celebrities, whether they be actors or athletes or whatever, I think, ""oh yeah, they'd be great to date, that'd be so much fun, I bet he's so nice."" When I tried researching this, all that came up was Celebrity Worship Syndrome, but that largely seems to be referring to stalkers. I'm not a stalker. I've never stalked anyone, celebrity or not, and I honestly don't think I'd be capable of that.

But, within the Wikipedia article for CWS, it states *""Evidence indicates that poor mental health is correlated with celebrity worship. Researchers have examined the relationship between celebrity worship and mental health in United Kingdom adult samples. One study found evidence to suggest that the intense-personal celebrity worship dimension was related to higher levels of depression and anxiety. Similarly, another study in 2004, found that the intense-personal celebrity worship dimension was not only related to higher levels of depression and anxiety, but also higher levels of stress, negative affect, and reports of illness.""*

I read a post on a different site about someone who was attracted exclusively to fictional characters, and someone suggested that it was just a manifestation of social anxiety, a way to explore romantic and sexual urges without actually having to interact with a real person. Which I feel like could explain me; that because of my anxiety (and/or possible asexuality, which idk, I'm still trying to figure out), my brain just focuses all of romantic/sexual energy onto people that I know I'll never actually have to talk to, meaning those feelings are safer to have.

Is anybody else familiar with this? Have you ever talked to anyone about it and tried to work through it? ",17Apr2018,1
1,"So my specific case is that I have an urge to play a certain video game, that is Skyrim, to play a certain role that is seemingly only available in this game. But I know for a fact that playing Skyrim bored me to death. And now I’m looking for other ways to play that role, but I also KNOW that it’s impossible to find it elsewhere. And now I’m left with this void. Trying desperately to fill it.  And right now I feel like this is what I NEED, and that whatever other activity that doesn’t fulfill this will not be enough for me. 

I know this sounds a bit ridiculous but I’d like to get some insight on what to do in cases like this. I don’t think this is an addiction because I haven’t played Skyrim in years. But clearly there’s something behind that feeling that goes deeper than just wanting to play a video game?

And that feeling makes me feel like I have to enjoy things for a specific reason, which makes me anxious. ",17Apr2018,0
2,"Recently my (F21) S/O (M 22) deleted social media. We have a few reasons behind it, including the amount of time we spend on it when we’re just hanging out or about to go to bed. He also brought up the fact that most females he follows post a lot of suggestive photos now that it’s getting warmer where we live, and he doesn’t feel like it’s appropriate for him to just be intaking that every time. (I have never had a problem with this or brought it to his attention, it was purely his own thoughts) 

Another key reason is that being young, it’s easy to feel like the people you’re keeping up with are doing so much better than you. We care a lot about fitness, and it’s easy to look at someone with a better physique and become jealous of that. It’s also easy to compare achievements in careers, milestones in relationships, etc. 

Both of us are deeply in love with the other, and would never TRULY want anything to change about our relationship. We both believe we share something that very few (lucky) people end up finding in their love lives. We also both have stable careers, make decent money, do a lot of cool activities, and have great family relationships. 

We just recognize that it becomes easy to get down on ourselves, or think about how things would be different if we had the “body goals” we set for ourselves, if we had better jobs, if we were able to live in these cool places we see, etc. 

Just wanted to see if anybody else has suffered from the same issue, or what thoughts you might have on the topic. ",17Apr2018,2
4,"I do not even know where to begin other than I've been officially diagnosed as MDD/GAD. Dyscalculia is evident given my life long struggles with learning math concepts and understanding numbers (I have to whip out my calculator just to do basic math because I can't do it in my head and it makes me feel incredibly stupid). I spent my life in remedial math class. I had to get a private tutor just to pass college algebra with a B. I'm embarrassed to admit that I don't know my multiplication tables. I've tried memorizing them for years to no avail. It doesn't stick no matter what.

I have always struggled with impulsive behaviors, I struggle to stay on task, and it's normal for me to zone out in the middle of a conversation because my mind goes elsewhere. 

I've tried reminders, calendars, emailing myself, sticky notes, etc. and nothing really sticks long enough to become an actual habit. I have difficulty budgeting and I'm not typically an impulse spender (IE - I don't make huge purchases on a whim), but I also catch myself feeling exhausted at the end of the day, no planned meals, and I end up going to Taco Bell. I also find that I have difficulty saying ""no,"" in any given situation whether it's a meeting, my daughter wants something, etc. I just know that I'm somehow stupid and cannot function like other normal adults. 

I have two college degrees and I still cannot manage to get my shit together. 

The predicament I'm currently in is I have $15 left in the bank to get me through the remainder of the month. This is due to unexpected expenses, overspending on stuff for kid specifically for track, and not getting it through my damn skull that I have to budget for the tightest month considering that in my current pay schedule, my monthly income can swing wildly with almost a $300 difference. This month's paycheck was a smaller month, which means that I probably should have told the kid that maybe we cannot afford to participate in track, but they are more than welcome to do running on their own and we can enter them in a 5K race when we can afford it. Maybe I should have just have withdrawn $100 at most and told the kid they can use the $100 to purchase needs for track, but once it's gone, it's gone and they have to stay within budget. 

I'm seriously considering cutting up my debit card and make it to where I have to physically go to the bank and withdraw cash and use that as my mode of spending. This would force me to physically see where my money is going and it would drastically reduce opportunities for me overspend. 

It also doesn't help that my MDD and my GAD serve as reminders that I'm failing at adulthood no matter what and that I'm just too stupid to get it, ever. Between everything I wish I had someone who would absolutely control my money for me because I will inevitably fuck it up and end up in this same damn predicament over and over again. I need someone to just simply say ok, you're bills are paid for the month, I've put XX back for saving, and XX back for emergencies, and here is your allowance for the remainder of the month: $100. Make it last because you're not getting a dime more beyond that. What throws everything off are the pending transactions. I know my online statement says XYZ, but it doesn't help that if I see $60 pending transaction that it just doesn't click that that's actually $60 less than what I actually have. I also avoid having holds placed on my account by NOT paying at the pump and paying inside instead. I've overdrawn as a result of a hold that had not yet cleared the bank and I was slapped with fees on top of that. Never again will I pay at the pump. 

I also have a corporate credit card and made it a personal rule that it NEVER LEAVES WORK for any reason. Ever. It stays in a locked drawer in my desk that requires a key to open. I also run any potential purchases by my boss first before I even buy anything because I feel like I will totally fuck up everything. 

This is just the worst and I feel like I shouldn't even be allowed to live independently and that I should probably be in some group home for the cognitively challenged because I really feel that stupid. ",17Apr2018,1
5,"Hey all, I need some advice as I really don’t know where to start. 

I have a history of mental illness in my family on my dads side. I have been dealing with mania and depression for the last 3 years now, while having increased anxiety at all times. I have gone to the hospital for help when I felt like I couldn’t do it anymore and they gave me a referral for therapy. I went for 3 months bi weekly and it helped but I had to stop as my sessions ran out. 

I have been taking paroxetine daily and feel slightly better with it in the anxiety side, but I constantly feel as if I am going to explode or lose control of myself.

6,"Last Friday, I had an awful night at work. I had worked both my jobs the whole week and gone to sports practice, and by that day I was even more exhausted than usual. I feel very uncomfortable working with people and it took me months to get used to my first job, and at this second job I feel nervous and awkward. I messed things up and cried a few times at work and just generally felt hopeless and stupid for being this way. I left work early and walked home. I hated myself so much that I considered slowing down in the road and seeing if I could just get hit. But it’s not like I really want to die. When I got home I had an argument with my dad and then tried to scratch my wrists in my room but I was too tired to bother getting anything sharper.

9,"Hi Reddit,

I've never posted here before but as of late I've really been struggling with my anxiety/depression. I had been dealing with it on my own for a while now, and it's gotten to the point where I decided to seek help. I went to my first therapy visit. I liked the lady, she was really kind and patient with me as I struggle to get myself to speak on things sometimes even when I really want to.

She asked me about religion, I don't really follow any. I don't feel one way or another about it but it's just not something I was raised into and have never really felt any desire to start. After I told her no she told me that it was a Christian practice (I honestly had no idea I was just searching for places online and found this one close to home) and then went on to say she is Christian but this has zero effect on me unless I want it to. 

I really don't mean to come off as an a**hole or judgemental but do any of you think this will this make a difference in anyway? I have zero experience with therapy and I wasn't sure if treatment within a Christian practice is any different. 

I guess I'm also kind of nervous because I had to fill out some forms online, I had put something on there that I know people within religion greatly frown upon. I don't open up to people about it so I decided to bite the bullet and put it on there so I could finally talk about it.

Any replies are appreciated.",17Apr2018,1

11,"TL;DR I'm currently taking Lamictal to treat my anxiety/depression because antidepressants didn't work in the past, I don't think it's working anymore and I'm concerned about the safety of it, considering switching meds, anyone else going through/went through this?

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder ~5 years ago. I tried multiple antidepressants (Zoloft, Lexapro, and Prozac I think) when I was first diagnosed but nothing worked. Then my doctor prescribed me Lamictal (an anti-convulsant) and it was the only thing that kept my thoughts from spiraling out of control, so I stayed on it. In 2016 I tried switching to Effexor, but I became worse and switched back (though I was also going through relationship problems at the time). 
Flash forward and not much has changed- I'm still on Lamictal, still in therapy, still not enjoying life. There are highs and lows but I'm always either depressed or anxious to some degree. I accepted it because I was too scared to switch meds and I don't want to risk getting worse for the possibility of becoming better. I can manage, but I'm not living. Now I'm wondering if I should switch medications (maybe to an antidepressant?).
I'm mainly confused as to why I was prescribed a medication used to treat bipolar for my anxiety/MDD and why it sort of worked... Has anyone else gotten the same prescription? Is it safe??
I realize that there's no magic pill that's going to make me feel better and I have to put in the work too, but if there's a possibility of exchanging my plastic hammer for a metal one then it would make things a lot easier to fix. And I realize most of y'all aren't psychiatrists, a lot of this is just me venting. Thanks for reading this far. :)

To anyone who feels extremely depersonalized, suicidal, or anything else -- know that there is a world out there waiting for you. There is a REAL world, and what is going on inside of your head is strictly your individual experience. It's hard to relate to others, because in this life we all go through our own battles. It's very challenging, sad, and difficult. But you can persevere.

Your strength is the most important thing in your life and in this world. You CAN fight. You can get through this. Know that no matter how ""in your head"" you are, you are a part of this world, and once you get through this battle you will feel bliss and reconnection.

He likes to simply talk about the emotions and identify the root cause of the issue, which you can call depression/anxiety.

To start, I'm either bipolar or major depressive with psychotic symptoms, and have received both diagnoses from pretty much every psychiatrist I've had since I was sixteen. I'm in my late twenties, attend a very reputable university as a mature student, and have worked my ass off to get to where I am. And I guess this realization about my lack of trust began when I realized that alone I can feel proud of my work and all that I've accomplished, but that those sentiments are both undermined and overpowered by equal parts disbelief and imposter syndrome the moment I hear anyone else tell me the same. It was because of this realization that I concluded  that understanding why I feel this way might help me heal, and now I fear I've opened a pandora's box that may well have been better off remaining sealed.

My childhood was its own kind of miserable. I am the youngest of an amalgam of 6: 3 older half siblings separated from me by 15 to 19 years, 1 older full sibling (3 years older), and 1 older step sibling (a year older). My parents divorced just before I turned 6, and when I was eight, my brother's fighting with my mother caused him to move in with our father, leaving me alone with my mother. I was a particularly intelligent child, at least according to my teachers, but my full sibling was/is absolutely brilliant, and in his struggle to cope with his life and his desperate search for a personal identity, his frustration and anger was often targeted towards me, resulting in behaviour that had me convinced from the time I was seven or eight, that he was actually going to kill me. He would beat me, strangle me until my vision would start to blur around the edges, and berate and belittle me to the point where I came to believe that I was worthless and insignficant. Parental involvement proved only to exacerbate the situation, since I would tend to be punished as well, and my brother would always find a way to carry out his revenge. Which is why by the time I was nine, I had adopted the belief that no authority figure would ever actually come to my aid, a belief that would be reinforced time and again in the following years, when teachers began to bully me. 

In eigth grade I had a teacher who had it out for me. I wasn't  particularly disruptive. As a white kid, I was actually minority in my school (I am also jewish, but this was not a problem at this time in my life), and by this time in our lives, race began to define who had friends and who didn't. Being a minority in this microcosm of society meant that any differences I had (I was a bit nerdy, but still athletic), meant that I was an outlier, and had progressively become an outcast after my only real friend had moved and transfered to another school district. In short, I was alone. This teacher just made things worse. She singled me out because she didn't think I was organized, and because she couldn't read my hand writing. She would make an example of me in front of the class as often as possible, going so far as the chastize me in the middle of class for being unable to read from my textbook when my glasses had been completely broken. And when I could take no more abuse and took it to the principal, I was treated like I was lying, and my account of the situation was thrown out in favor of the teachers. In what can only be described as an act of revenge for putting her in the spotlight, she proceeded to have me put into a special ed program, which was announced in front of my whole class, where my counselor/helper would come to tell me that he had ""absolutely no idea why such an bright student"" was being put under his care.

In high school, I was the target of anti-semetism and a campaign aganst me after I stood up to a bully (who wasn't white) after weeks of torment. I was called a kyke in the middle of class (the teacher took no action against them, but I got in trouble for disrupting the class, even after I explained to her what kyke meant). I had shoes thrown at me. There were pictures drawn of me behind bars claiming I was a racist. All I had done was stand up for myself. To be clear, I am not a racist, nor was I then. The faculty took no action. Because I had stood up for myself I was told, in so many words, that either they take it seriously and suspend me and others involved, or they can act like I never said anything. I chose the latter since it was incomprehensible to me that I was equally culpable as the rest of the parties involved. In hind sight, I should have chosen the former and proceeded to sue the school, but my mother was notorious for overreacting, so to save myself the embarassment, I opted to stay silent, even when swastikas started showing up. I found out through the grapevine that there had even been plans of a lynching, which only stopped by virtue of one of my siblings overhearing and stepping in with their friends (comprised of metalheads and drug dealers).

Around this time I had my first relatonship, which would begin a series of betrayals that have rendered me incapable of getting close to anyone. The relationship ended when she cheated on me with her ex. My second girlfriend left me for someone else. My third used me to make someone else jealous. My fourth attempt at a relationship was mired by my lack of trust, ending when I became convinced I was being used (I was wrong). It was few months after that I suffered my first psychotic episode, and finally began receiving much needed treatment. I started dating someone casually after getting some control over my life, but she left me for someone else after telling me that I was too crazy for her. The next relationship was a good one, but her mother's hatred of me (which she was kind enough to verbalize to me) caused their relationship to erode, so I ended it. A week later my now ex informed me that she had slept with a close friend of mine, and gave me evidence for which she apologize profusely (guilty conscience). The friend, even when confronted with evidence, denied it and attempted to gas-light me, using my psychosis as a weapon, so I cut him out of my life. The next relationship I had lasted a few years, we ended up moving in together, and I would later find out she cheated on me multiple times with different people, in our bed while I was at work (she couldn't hold down a job, and I was supporting us both). The following relationship was a long one, we were essentially common-law, and she used other men in her life as a means of making me jealous, all the while accusing me of cheating on her, which was topped off with an accusation of cheating on her the morning after my father's funeral. After we broke up she fooled around with a close friend of mine. A few years later I attempted a relationship with someone else, who dropped me for a friend of my roomate - a person who was ever present in my life, and I was forced to watch their relationship from the next room the whole time.

I am, of course, not necessarily innocent in all of this. It's not easy being in a relationship with someone who suffers from whichever of the two diagnoses I've received. Especially given the fact that my childhood taught me that people don't actually care, and that the questions of ""how are you feeling/doing?"" and ""are you alright?"" are seldom, if not ever, asked in earnest. I confess that I was a bit of a hypochondriac as a child, but as I've gotten older that hypochondria has come to be recognized for what it was: mental illness in a child too young to possess the language to express it. From the time I was eight I suffered from the same illness repeatedly, sometimes for weeks on end: a stomach ache, dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea. My mother (who led a depression support group and has a bachelors degree in psychology) was never able to come face to face with the reality that her child wasn't physically sick. My step mother insulted me for it. My father didn't care and neither did my siblings. When I tried to talk about what was bothering me, should anything come up that would set my mother off, I would sit in embarassment while she tried to seek justice for me, only serving to result in retaliation from siblings and people of authority. As a result, I came to the sobering realization at perhaps eleven or twelve years old, that I was alone and always would be. I began to internalize everything negative. As far as I could tell, no one's claims of caring were genuine. I had my first psychotic episode when I was sixteen. A state of mania followed by extreme depression and a black out, at which point I began experiencing moments of ""lost time"", likely brought on my bouts of insomnia during periods of high stress, moments which I dared not speak of for fear of being institutionalized. Moments which, more recently, have had me regain control to discover that I had been preparing for suicide (I subsequently told my therapist who then assisted me in traveling to, and admiting myself to an emergency psych ward). As a teen, this led me to an temporary obsession with meditative practices to help me comb through my day, and ground myself in the hopes of preventing further incidents. While my family now accepted that I suffered from mental illness, they rejected that I suffered from insomnia, so while they accepted that I needed an antipsychotic and an antidepressant, they refused anything that wasn't an OTC sleep aid, but melatonin and 5-HTP only resulted in nightmares. This made me reach out to drugs and alcohol. I developed an addiction to ketamine when I was eighteen, shortly after being kicked out of my mother's house over a stain on the carpet and some plants that an animal had dug up in the garden. I was well behaved. My family had no suspicion of my drug use (confirmed), nor any idea of any other misadventures I may have had. In recent years I've confessed to my mother about various aspects of my behaviour at the time in an attempt to see if I had really done something to deserve being kicked out, and it has been confirmed that neither her nor her spouse had any idea, which in many ways, hurts more somehow. Instead, I've learned that it was really just the result of a failing marriage boiling over and burning the person closest to the pot.

I've erected walls around me that not even I really know how to bring down. As I said, I'm not easy to live with. I shut down. I go silent and retreat into myself when under stress and grapple with myself internally to hold onto some piece of myself so as to avoid slipping into my psychosis. For me, it feels as though this is the only way to avoid losing myself to my condition completely, and it takes everything I have just to do it. I've found that my thoughts of suicide are dissociative - when I want to kill myself, it's not a want to destroy me, but what I represent to myself, and as long as I can identify a difference between the two concepts I can [hopefully] maintain some form of control. But this takes all the energy I have, resulting in recluse like behaviour, which more recently seemed like agoraphobia. I can only begin to imagine what it must be like to sit on the other side of a loved one behaving like this, all the while feeling helpless and not understanding why they won't just explain themselves. But from the the otherside, my experiences have taught me all to well that if I let someone in, they'll only end up hurting me. My full sibling tormented me, my other siblings only care about themselves expecting me to listen to their problems for hours then glossing over mine. My mother kicked me out, my father ignored me, my friends betrayed me, stole from me and lied to me. My romantic partners used me, threw me away and cheated on me. The thought of opening up chokes me and suffocates more viscerally than my brothers hands did when we were children. In all my relationships I always find that they demand honesty and loyalty, but refuse to give it. I do my best. I'm honest about the day, and I'm always loyal. I try to open up as much as I can, but they never do. They dance around subjects, gloss over details and tell me I'm prying when I ask the very same questions they do of me. It feels as though they think I'm not worthy of their honesty. And as that progresses into internalized doubt, I start to hear those nagging voices in my head that try so hard to tear me down. I've been left because of my illness before... if I let them in, they'll run... if I don't, then I'm the bad guy. They'll insist to me that their depression or anxiety is something I can't understand, when I know it all to well, and then when I suggest to them there might be an element of my condition that is not present in theirs (a voice in my head, blackouts, paranoid thoughts, sudden intense changes in mood), I'm told I'm wrong, not just about them, but about my own experience. It's like they think it's a competition. When something is wrong with them I ask ""what do you feel?"", ""what do you need?"", ""does it help to describe it?"", ""if you want we can just sit here quietly until you feel like talking or doing something else,"" waiting patiently for them to reply. I suggest ""maybe we try x and see if that helps"", ""lets work you through this at your pace, don't worry about the rest of the world"". When something is wrong with me it's ""what the hell's your problem?"", ""man up"", ""aren't you on medication for this?"". They accuse ""why are you doing this to me?"". They tell me ""I have anxiety, so I know exactly what you're going through,"" as if somehow every mental illness is synonymous with anxiety, and that by having it they've been given an honorary Ph.D. I don't say ""you can't understand"", but try to explain what it's like to have a condition that is comprised of depression, anxiety, mania, paranoid thoughts, moments of lost time, and moments of feeling a like a ghost in the machine or an observer with little to no agency. When I do, they go on the defensive, as if it's some kind of a competition to see whose mental scars run deepest. As if their experience qualifies them to dismiss my own. I'd like to chalk it up to bad luck, that I've just had bad luck with friends and significant others... but these days, it seems empirically true that the only people who show interest in me are ultimately going to hurt me, betray me, and leave me wondering why I even tried in the first place.


I have a tendency to be a bit pedantic, and because I was raised in an environment where academic conversations were fairly commonplace, I tend to challenge claims and arguments for what I see as the joy of conversation, but as others see as arrogance and know-it-all-ism. On the brightside, I'm right at home at the University, but this only adds to my isolation outside. People who used to be friends have abandoned me and accused me of being arrogant or pretentious because it is somehow a crime to want to do things that are intellectually stimulating, such as watching an historical movie, documentaries or to visit a museum. I recently was accosted by an alleged friend for saying ""I guess I really just need to find a friend or two with similar academic interests"", for being pompous despite the context of the conversation being that I was looking for someone to attend a symposium with me at the university. On the one hand, I'm fine with losing a friend because we no longer share interests (or perhaps never have), but on the other it only serves to further underscore the overwhelming sense of loneliness that reverberates through my life. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too fixated on the negatives, as I've been told by exes on more than one occasion; I believe this might be an inescapable conclusion since this is essentially what it means to suffer from depression of any kind, just without the assumed notion of control. I've spent years trying to train myself to distance myself from a problem or a troublesome situation so as to approach it with as little bias as possible; to break down my issues into some sort of causal chain of events so as to better understand how external stressors affect me. I see a therapist. I take medication. Recently I started a new medication which has given me back a certain amount of functionality that I'd been robbed of for nearly a year (which had caused the aforementioned agoraphobia like symptoms). It is, perhaps, also why I believe the act of posting this will be cathartic, as opposed to a waste of time. I think more than anything I want to hear someone say ""I understand your pain, and I've experienced my own, and you will find people who care."" These days I have some functionality, but more often than not in plagued by nightmares taking the form of betrayal, isolation and silence. It feels like I'm one epsiode away from falling too deep into the pit to ever climb out, and it worries me. While things are improving for me, I feel so starved from meaningful interaction that I worry I may never find it, that I might fall into old habits. Worse still, I'm worried that if I don't find meaningful interactions, or people who I can actually trust, I may just lose hope altogether.

TL;DR I've suffered from mental illness for pretty much my entire life. I've been abused, cheated on multiple times, stabbed in the back and betrayed more times than I can count by friends, family, people of authortiy and exes. I find I can no longer trust anyone, and am starting to feel like I may never find someone I can trust again.",17Apr2018,1

me: yeah...

36,"Hey Reddit,
So I'm from California(told me to give state I live in) and I have a ""friend"" who has anxiety and depression. We've we're having some disagreements to say the least a week before break.
     Basically the thing was about her self-infliction of pain, and I was just trying to support her as a friend. Then she was saying that I was judging her and she was just assuming that ""because [she] knows when people are judging [her]"". Then she went on to say how  ""people like me"" aren't friends with people like her. 

   After that I just forgave her because she said it was all her ""anxiety"" that was talking not her....

   But then while we were on a bus (we were on our way to a music festival with the school band) she obviously implies that she's mad at me and then goes on to start judging me for my personality (don't know if this is relevant but she also judged my music tastes). For the rest of the day she just gives side  remarks that are just rude and mean....This on the Friday before break.

    While I entered break, I was just done. I felt like all I was trying to do as a friend was just incarcerated. I started to think in my head of how she's a fuckin hypocrite and how she's just being a bitch. She never said sorry....

But am I overreacting? Is this actually because of her anxiety? Is she acting like a bitch because of her depression and such? I don't really know what to think... Is this just all my fault??? I have no idea what I should do, because I don't know if this is because of her medical condition or is it just cause she's a bitch?????? People say she is just a bitch but I don't want to believe it. I just wanna help. But I don't want to get treated like trash, I really don't need that..... 

Now she's asking if we're gonna talk now. Breaks over and I really just don't want to talk to her....


Please send positive or helpful advice.... Thank you for your time.",17Apr2018,1
37,"Akathisia began after being on ziprasidone 40mg for 9 days—ziprasidone was a ""plug"" to my neuroleptic dependence. I also started sertraline 50mg about the same time—it had a strong positive effect on my mood. Sertraline made me realize SSRIs / anti-depressants can be more than placebo.

Akathisia showed itself as I walked around the psych unit restlessly. I couldn't lay down for a minute. It wasn't permanently there, and I also didn't feel bothered by it at all. I was sent home.

At home, I had to visit a new psychiatrist.

- He removed 3mg of 6mg of my bromazepam daily. This was 16 days ago.
- He switched ziprasidone 40mg with aripiprazole 10mg. This was 13 days ago. 
- He switched sertraline 50mg with escitalopram 10mg. This was 5 days ago.

I still have akathisia, and I think it has gotten much worse. Here's the list of symptoms I've been experiencing:

- Worsening walking around and inability to sit. (akathisia)
- Improving burning feelings in the stomach and chest area. (bromazepam withdrawal for 16 days now?)
- Not improving light-headedness, dizziness. (bromazepam withdrawal for 16 days now?)
- Not improving feelings of difficulty to breathe. (bromazepam withdrawal for 16 days now?)
- Unwillingness to do anything. (due to above symptoms)


Current medication:

- 12:00 Escitalopram 10mg
- 12:00 Aripiprazole 10mg
- 12:00 Bromazepam 1.5mg
- 17:00 Bromazepam 1.5mg
- 22:00 Lorazepam 2.5mg


I've used: sertindole (male issues), risperidone (gained weight fast), ziprasidone (akathisia), and aripiprazole (even more akathisia?).


Questions:

- How do people generally experience akathisia, and how does it improve? Can there be paradoxical effects right before akathisia ""leaves""?
- What neuroleptics have you had success with that I haven't mentioned? If any.",17Apr2018,1

48,"I am dating a girl who has problems letting go of her ex. I cannot understand why and I'm hoping that someone could explain? 

Here's the background story:

We met through her sister and we spent so much time together and after meeting me, she had the courage to dump him because he was abusive. Her sister told me that I gave her the motivation to do it because she felt so happy to be in my company. 

She used to suffer from bulimia and healed herself.

We dated several times and I noticed that her ex BF would constantly try to call and text her. One night we were meant to go for a run but she was 1.5 hours late and when she came over told me that she had been on the phone to her ex BF. I comforted her as she was upset, where I hugged her, which led to going to going to bed with each other.

I felt that it was a love triangle and told her that I wasn't happy with the situation because I felt that she still loves him and we had a 1-on-1 chat. I told her that it upsets me that she doesn't want to commit because she still has feelings for her ex. I expressed that I feel like I am a rebound to get over her ex and she said it's not true.

She opened up to me that she has had problems with letting go with all her relationships regardless of how toxic or abusive they were and said it's due to her childhood because her dad - who is an alcoholic and suicidal.

I told her that we should be friends and that I want to help/support her. I told her to get help from someone who can help like a therapist. She was surprised and happy I said that and we hugged each other for 4 hours or more while talking. She asked me on my thoughts on starting a relationship with me and I said I would love that. It was a very beautiful conversation.

53,"I'm 18M, live in the USA, where practice is still very normalized to circumcise males at infancy, because they're males. I had some problems with my parts and have reasonable attributed many of them to the fact that this happened to me, and I've had nothing but anger, sadness, loneliness, and worry towards the issue since. The first major step I took to combat this is that I have started that process of foreskin restoration, and those aforementioned penile problems are lessening well so far.

I have posted a few times in other subreddits and found that both in the USA and South Korea (long story short, I plan to move to South Korea), a decent woman won't outright reject me for having foreskin if other parts of the relationship are already good. Somehow I still can't internally accept the fact that it'll be fine when I do have foreskin again, that this, if anything, would only be better in a relationship for me. That I could, from that issue alone, learn if my partner values me enough based on their grievances of my body or lack of, pr best case, encouragement of. I know that a decent woman worth my time will not try to pressure me to stop restoring, or worse, have it done again. Most people, IRL and online, have again reiterated that this is fine, I still have a chance in the dating world, that foreskin isn't this big burden most decent women would instantly be turned off by. 

It's something internal I'm sure that's causing this, but I've no idea what exactly it could be. Like in a conscience state of mind, when I *actively think about it*, I know it's true that I won't be hindered by restoring. Even some gauging responses from Koreans and Americans, I found have that really I have a ***higher*** chance of being accepted in a relationship, as Korea doesn't have that perception of ""Foreskin = Horrid Hygiene"" as much as it in the US. Or at least my very conservative state of Missouri, where the thought is very prominent.

Again, It's like only half of me is fully convinced that restoring my foreskin will be better for me. Consciously I know it's only going to get better when I restore, but when emotions start kicking in that depression and crying comes back, thoughts that I'll just be prone to another abusive relationship. This time not with my mother, centered around my grades and lack of religiosity, but a woman claiming to love me, then trying to discourage me having my body the way that I personally want it to be.

**TL;DR- Circumcised 18M in the USA, I don't like it one bit since I've encountered problems with it. Rationally I know restoring my foreskin will be better both for my mental health and for a romantic relationship, yet emotionally that thought still lingers that most women will still reject me because of it being there, or simply because I want to have my body differently.**",17Apr2018,3

I thought I’d reach out to this community. I never imagined myself having to come here but I’ve been feeling so lost lately that I figured I had to start somewhere for my journey back to being whole.

Some context: I’m 25 years old, I grew up in a very indian household where talking about mental health has been taboo, and I have been going to therapy regarding self confidence issues for the past few weeks. Last Monday, I had a lapse in judgment when I found out I might potentially get laid off at work. My reaction to this negative situation was to get drunk and numb the emotions. That following Tuesday morning took a major toll on my emotional well-being. I was advised by a friend to see a psychiatrist about this as well so I will be doing that too.

When I went to therapy yesterday, I realized that in so many negative situations I tend to do one of two things: hold onto the emotion and internalize or frantically act out with lack of composure. I don’t know how composure is maintained during those situations and I really want to fix that about me. My therapist recommended putting together a “toolbox” for the next time something negative happens to me. And she wanted me to figure it out on my own...

But I have no clue where to begin. I’ve been struggling yesterday after the session to really come up with these tools I can add because I’ve always felt at the mercy of other people’s judgment. Idk if this is an advice thread or a venting thread but I felt the need to get this out somewhere. Feel free to leave a comment with thoughts if you’d like :)",17Apr2018,1

i've struggled with developing mental health/emotional literacy and healthy coping mechanisms for most of my life; i never had a support system with my family or friends, as i moved frequently and vulnerability was never talked about in my family. i've been lucky and was able to find a group of friends that have become my rock and helped me out in my recent college years, but i wanted to make an effort to help those who feel like they don't feel comfortable reaching out to those around them as i was there for a large part of my life too.

the basic lowdown of my design is that it's a system that focuses on creating a repository of coping mechanisms inputted by people that others could access in times of need based on what someone is feeling at the time. i don't want to overload this post with ALL of the details, but i really want input from people other than those i personally know; everyone's experience is different, so i gladly welcome all voices and thoughts on this!!

PM me (or comment) if you would like to help out in any way.

thanks so much!",17Apr2018,1
79,I believe I have bad anxiety and I told my mom about it she said she would book an appointment with a mental health professional. What should I expect to happen and how open do I have to be? I have a deep closet of very bad thoughts and I don’t want anyone to see them.,17Apr2018,2
80,"Male, 19, live in USA
I've been diagnosed with severe depression, severe anxiety, mild psychosis, and a few minor behavioral/personality disorders. I've left the topic of work alone in therapy because I've always wanted to make my own way and do as much for myself as possible.   
The problem is, my parents kicked me out a month ago and I moved in with my brother, and the change in living situation made it impossible for me to get to work on time, and there was no way I'd be able to take a different shift (it was custodial and all the work was done early in the morning), so I had to quit that job. I haven't been able to find a new job yet, and I've started having panick attacks whenever I get turned down for another job (this can range anywhere from 0 to 3 times a day). And they're not little mini attacks either. I've blacked out a couple of times.     
I'm worried, because I really want to be independent from gov't assistance, but with all my other issues and now I can't find a job and I've started having these attacks. I'm wondering if maybe I should just throw in the towel and go for the assistance. What do you all think?   
And if I should, does anyone know how I would go about doing that? ",17Apr2018,3
81,"I have a doctors appointment tomorrow but my adhd is getting wildly worse over the past month with hours of being 9/10 energy and absolutely can't focused. However, these past two days have been really bad with me either being 12:10 energy or falling asleep while driving, with no in between. Classes have been skipped, grades are plummeting and I'm getting no work done at my internship because I keep getting up every two minutes. I can't Even concentrate on my favourite things such as video games and TV shows, my attention span is gone for those too. I'm struggling right now",17Apr2018,5
83,"Things have gotten very out of hand with my wife and her anxiety. It stems from medical things. Her grandmother has diabetes, she panics that she does. Then a friend died young of cancer, she panics that she has cancer. Her father had a heart attack (survived and doing well), she panics that she's going to have a heart attack. It's hard to tell whether there is something medically wrong with her or if it's a panic attack and anxiety.

She's had diarrhea for about a month now and is convinced it's cancer or an IBD even though in the 4 trips to the ER have shown she's only been a little dehydrated. All within this time, she has seen her primary and a GI, who wanted to do both endoscopy and colonoscopy. She only did the endoscopy so far and bailed on the colonoscopy because she feels that making someone do the prep is abusive (her words). I've tried to get her to eat small, soft foods. Done everything I could find  and what the doctors and nurses suggest but she won't keep up with it after a few hours. Even medicine is like, take one dose&gt;I don't like it&gt;never takes again. I've been tough with her, her mother has been tough with her, even the doctors and nurses have beeb tough with her. One nurse even told her to stop b/c nobody wants to be around the crazy stomach lady (not in meanness but in honest trying to help my wife b/c nurse deals with the same stuff). But my wife just can't...I don't know, get a grip on her nerves and mind? She's been out of work for the month now and I've been working from home trying to help her, being her caregiver 24/7 but it's hard. She's always pushing against anything we try to help her with. She just secured a spot for a colonoscopy this Friday so you can imagine the panic right now. She had a psychiatrist appt scheduled that day and she cancelled it for the colonoscopy. We're in a tough position. 
She truly wants the prep to happen in the hospital under supervision. She's talked to 2 GI's about this who both said they don't do that unless emergency admits them into the hospital. I feel like she's looking for every little thing (on top of every feeling she's overthinking about already) to go to the hospital just so she can be admitted. I've been trying to get her to eat but she says everything hurts. She was last at the ER on Sunday where everything was fine. She eats and has diarrhea, but I mean, she hasn't eaten in days anything but water and pedialyte with some clear Ensure. I need to keep her together until her colonoscopy (during her endoscopy she insisted on not having meds and nearly ripped the camera out, the nurses had to hold her hands down)........any advice to get me through til Friday would be appreciated and how to handle her anxiety after, like is a psychiatrist the best? Why are they so damn busy, seriously next booking in 6 weeks.

Thank you for your time. ",17Apr2018,1
84,"I just want to find some online support here. My last narcship ended violently a year ago when he assaulted me and then held a cocked and loaded weapon with 2 bullets threatening murder/suicide. He got taken away for only 48 hours in a psychiatric ward. I immediately started to learn about NPD and started NO CONTACT. 

I’ve tried running and running. I got a civil restraining order (not as good in my state), and he violates it and nothing still. He used to follow me to therapy, and even went as far as to follow me to Hawaii on a vacation and hack into my Facebook impersonating me. He constantly posts malicious lies about me and I am the center of his vengeful smear campaign, in which he blames me and makes it sound like it’s okay to do so because him going to the psych ward for what he says are lies even though i have EVIDENCE made him loose custody of his kid (to another woman.) He dug his own grave to lose a job we had mutually but I’m still blamed for everything bad he’s experienced since the break up now. 

I thought it was over once I got injured badly, he couldn’t stop publicly galavanting in our mutual industry about “karma.” He stopped for a couple months. Then I worked hard to get healthy and get back to work and am even dating a friend of 3 years now and then of course it has started up again, and he started messaging my new boyfriend and coworkers. 

So I’m no longer in flight mode, I have seen that doesn’t work, and I’m tired of being afraid for myself and child. I will maintain no personal contact, but I’m now in fight mode. I went back to the police for the original incident and am having them pursue getting it to the DA with new evidence I just now gave them. I filed 2 more reports at my local police, one for harassment and one for online impersonation which is a felony in my state. I don’t know if anything will come of any of these though. 

I hired the best lawyer in town to get me a real restraining order which in my state is called a protective order, and I’m going to stand back up to the abuse and bullying. While I am scared, my main hope is to show him that I’m not scared of him anymore and maybe it will STOP! 

I’m getting my concealed carry license in a couple days and I’m going to start attending firearm/self-defense classes from ex combat veterans. Would I do that if I were not afraid? People still don’t seem to get my fear though. They say things like, if he was really going to do something he would have done it already, and he’s all talk, ect. And that makes me feel so alone in my fear :(

Anyone else out there ever been in my shoes aka the hot seat and know and understand exactly why I feel the way I do?",17Apr2018,10
85,"So I am court ordered for a mental evaluation and am possibly looking at outpatient treatment as part of my conditions. My questions is how many weeks does it take to get discharged from outpatient treatment? What are the possible to steps to pass my evaluation to not get placed in outpatient. Can I refuse treatment after my probation is complete or will they force me to stay in treatment? 

Thanks ",17Apr2018,1
86,"I love and care for her very much, but I think she has trouble regulating her emotions. If something goes wrong she’ll take it to the extreme sometimes. She got a 70 something percent on a quiz, and she threatened to kill herself, she was screaming over the phone crying her eyes out and had a belt around her neck while over the phone. Sometimes something bad happens and she’s okay but a lot of the time she can’t handle it. It was her birthday yesterday and she got new shoes, but her new dog that they got a month ago chews on them a bit, and she was crying and slamming against the dogs cage. I can understand her being angry or frustrated at this but not to this level. The dog is only a few months and a puppy. She is in a semi-abusive household, I’m not sure what exactly the details are but I know it’s not a good relationship. I’m worried that if something bad happens one of these days she’s gonna do something she regrets either to herself or to someone or something else. When she gets mad she says mean things to me even if I’m not responsible. I offered to buy her new shoes to replace them but she told me to shut up, and to do a homework assignment for her. Her parents won’t take her to see a therapist or a doctor or anything. I’m 15 and she just turned 16. I don’t know what to do. ",17Apr2018,1
87,"I take over 500 pictures a day, I absolutely hate my face in selfies. My face is so stretched out and I look dead. I also hate pictures of me in bad lighting that other people like. I love how I look when I record myself or take a picture in the mirror and then flip the image(so it's no longer a mirror image) The disparity between my looks between pictures is making my mind melt. I have spent the last 7 years obsessed about my looks but I eventually came across to finding relative acceptance last summer but then I had an incident with a girl and my esteem spiralled out of control.",17Apr2018,3
