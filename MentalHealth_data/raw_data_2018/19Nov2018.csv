0," I've reached the point in my life where I have one of two options. End it all now and get it over with. Or put up with a few more years of torment and sorrow. I've stopped taking any medications at this point, still have two prescriptions that need to be turned in. I don't fucking care anymore, I just want this to be over with. I have not had a good life whatsoever. Abused by my dad, sexually abused by several people, and bullied daily for about 16 years. Following that it has been the darkest depressive state I've ever been in because of all of this that took place. I'm tired of living a lie, I'm tired of reaching out to people only to get A) a lame excuse as to why they cannot spend time or B) they make plans and then change their mind last minute. I don't know how many more cries for help it will take for people to realize that this is serious. I just want to be happy. I'm tired of feeling this way. My entire life has been nothing but sorrow. I don't know what it is like to be 100% happy with myself. Meditation, drugs, drawing. NOTHING is helping. Been in and out of therapy for years. Been hospitalized, I feel like I've tried everything. I'm certain that literal years of my lifespan have been erased as a result of this. I'm morbidly obese, addicted to nicotine, and have no plans of stopping this path of self destruction. I even know hos I'm gong to take myself out if I do. (More than likely one day I'll just take a handful of my sleeping pills and never wake up again.) I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of reaching out to no avail. I'm tired of ruining relationships with friends and family because I'm too chicken shit to deal with what I've experienced. I'm fucking weak. Worthless, and have no future ahead of me as I'm too depressed to give a shit about anything. I'm about two seconds away to self harming tonight. Not suicide. But self harm. I'm tired of this shit. It's never going to go away. I was delusional to believe that it ever would. ",19Nov2018,2

2,For the last few years I've never really felt a range of emotions. Nothing seems to upset me but I still constantly feel down. A close relative of mine recently passed away and while I expected to feel sad for days it didn't really affect me. Of course I miss them but I don't feel upset or anything. I feel like there's something wrong with me and I've been like this for years. I'm scared to tell my friends incase they think I'm insensitive or worse just a bad person. I feel like my parents getting a divorce when I was young may have done this to me as I don't remember being upset by anything since. If anyone could help me with this that would be great.

3,"i have heavy ocd, and i'm used to it - all the obsessions, cleanliness, obsessive thoughts, rocd, everything.    
lately, i've been really paranoid about schizophrenia. i have realized i might have some form of hypochondria - i keep re-checking the schizophrenic symptoms day in and day out and being scared that i am schizophrenic.    
i have a history of heavy depression and anxiety (which has affected my social and sexual life). now, i don't have schizophrenia in family history. i do not have auditory or visual hallucinations (i will sometimes have hypnogagic (pre-sleep) hallucinations and i might see a flashing light for a millisecond while walking, if i turn my head real fast, but i don't hear voices in everyday life or see things that aren't there). i don't feel like i have superpowers, or believe that dreams are real, or that radio/tv is talking to me or that the government is controlling my thoughts. sometimes, when i'm walking, i feel like there could be people in houses with lights on looking at me, which has happened before (and it was not a hallucination, just creepy people).    
i don't feel like someone is following me ever, or that i might get hurt. i will sometimes overthink a lot and just seem a little unresponsive, but just cause i'm thinking normal stuff. with friends and my girlfriend, i am totally fine, i talk normally, and i'm able to think normally. but i'm still paranoid about having schizophrenia hard.    
is it just my ocd playing with me and inflicting the paranoia? i keep having obsessive thoughts about it, despite not experiencing any hallucinations or delusions (except hypnogagic, rarely) or having the symptoms, or having family history of it. i'm 16. i will also sometimes get really jealous and obsessive and not trust my partner, which i always relate to relationship ocd. please help.      
should i be worried? :(",19Nov2018,1

this can be a long text so if you read it all I'm already thanking you for the patience and empathy, I promise to try to make it short! (english is not my 1st language, so sorry for that. Sorry also for the terms I've used, please feel free to correct me if it's the case)

&amp;#x200B;

So... the ex-gf of my current gf was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. But before that we used to be friends (while they were still together as a couple), and she is not a very open person, she's very shy and recluse but liked me as a friend. I was there when she had her first episode and it was an intense one, very intense, and I stood by her side and took care of her until help came (help came 12h later, I was constantly worried she would hurt herself or me due her strength and how scared she was) and after that she was into an institution and I haven't spoke with her since then. I feel like a bitch for this. But here's the reason:

I'm calling myself **J**, she is **S**. and my gf (her ex) I'll call **E.**

By the time she had her first episode she had recently broke up with E. but the relationship was dead some time before that (she was already slowly going deep in her condition for some months, E. told me that, she had no idea about S. problem). During S. episode it was clear that E. was part of the problem as she was mixing E's image with hallucinations in her mind. We all study in the same college, being E. my roommate and S. our neighbor. After she got institutionalized she and E. talked about it and turns out she doesn't remember about what happened and very little about some weeks before that too. Those weeks was when we've met (all that was 5 months ago) so she don't remember much about me. 

during this 5 months with S. hospitalized me and E. got closer and start dating. Next semester S. will return to college and probably find out me and E. are together. I now fear this will hurt her and I don't want to cause any pain to her at all!

I don't know how to deal with it. Should I tell her with a message? Should I tell her in person? Should I just be cool about it? Should I worry?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. I fear she my have a second episode, I fear she try to kill me or E. or herself.  Not just because of her mental condition but because I know she has a problem with medication, she used to lie to E. about being taking medication for any health problem that comes up, she used to hide pills and such and refused medicine for a long time. Being away from her family, having few friends and living alone at college I fear she may stop taking the meds and I really worry about that. I wouldn't think twice if I had to spend other 12h with her waiting for help if it's the case, I'll be there.  I worry about my life and their because she got violent and tried to hammer the head of her old mother off (literally)  the first time and I don't know how worst it can get, there was a lot of violence. How to tell her this without making it seems we conspired behind her back? or that E. was cheating her or something like that?

&amp;#x200B;

Even if she's okay with this E. and me thing, I really would like to know How do I proceed in case of a episode, if ever happen again.

5,"I've been feeling so bizarre recently. It's happened to me in the past and I can't figure out what it is. 

I have these episodes that last a week or so where I feel so detached from everything. Like I'm living in some dream and nothing makes sense. I woke up this morning and checked the clock- it was 1 pm. Funny, I'd set an alarm for 7 am. I missed work. So I felt like shit. I go brush my teeth and check my phone. Now it's 10 am. I check the clock, it still says 1pm. This is a digital alarm clock. What on Earth? Stuff like this happens all the time, reality blurs and I don't feel normal. 

There are most likely logical explanations for all the odd things that happen. I'm more concerned with how I feel. I feel out of place and I can't do anything as a result. I'll often have vivid dreams all the time and feel like I'm on autopilot. I won't remember whether I've done something or not, or I'll remember something that didn't happen. I'm also having issues with sleep, particularly waking up.

I have been under a ton of stress recently. This has happened before. Is it just my brain trying to protect me? Numb me off from the world? 

Am I going crazy? If so, what can I do to get better? 

TL;DR: I have episodes where my sense of reality is foggy",19Nov2018,2
6,"I get really angry about everything. Not just normal stuff, like people being rude or things that normal people get mad about. The other day my friend asked me to hang out and I didn't want to talk to them for the whole day. My parents say it’s hormones and that’s probably true. It’s just strange since I'm a girl, anger isn’t usually linked with estrogen. 

I got in an argument with my mum. Nothing big, I was just in a bad mood and she got mad too. I apologized and she didn't. She’s a parent, after all, that’s what they do. Force you to apologize and make you feel bad for it. But the argument's over. It was stupid, and yet I still feel really angry. I want to punch the wall and jump off of a bridge at the same time. I'm not sure what’s wrong with me. Do I have a mental illness or is this normal? ",19Nov2018,2

8,"Hi
So I don't really get what's up with me.
I'm almost 17 years old and since I hitted puberty I thougth I was slowly getting more depressed because nothing made me happy anymore, but this last year I really spent a lot of time thinking about it and I think it might be more of an anxiety related problem, althou I'm not sure.

Whenever I get out of the house for anything I can get a bit scared but nothing that makes it imposible to do stuff, and for the most part I act freely and even outgoing.
But as soon as I get home I feel a deep shame and I have to lock myself in my room because I'm just thinking of every mistake I made that keeps me in this alert state that only goes away when distracting myself with my phone. After that I feel extremely sad even tho I know I might have been a bit awkward but it shouldn't be such a big deal.
And then I get some days where I'm just plain sad, irritable and don't want to do anything because I know whatever I do will just make me seem like a joke.

So can you have social anxiety with the fear really kicking in after ""the event""?
If not what is wrong with me? I've been to a therapisy but left it because it costed a lot of money and didn't felt like it was doing anything other than making me cry.

9,"I should feel only happy about this. All of the things I've always said about the facility are true. The 10 months I was there was like prison plus being overmedicated like I was a test subject. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still feel anger. I am not over this at all and it's been 10 years since I was released. I mostly forgive my parents for putting me there, but I'm still so angry at the system who convinced them that I needed this treatment. I'm furious that kids were put through all the abuse and staff members tolerated it.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, being in an inpatient program can be needed for a short time (hospitalization). However, all of these facilities are completely different and need to be shut down.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I wonder if my parents have been easier on me because they forced me to stay at the RTF even when I tried to tell them what was happening. They had never experienced medical professionals lying to them and I was very sick at the time.

10,"As the title suggests, I've been feeling pretty shitty for the best part of 4-5 months now but I don't know whether the way I'm feeling/symptoms I'm experiencing are justifiable enough to actually mention to a doctor. 

I've felt like this in the past for short periods of time (can probably identify a handful of periods that have lasted between 2-6 months over the past three years) but never quite this bad. I had put a lot of it down to being purely situational - I graduated this summer and I've been grad job hunting ever since to no success, plus I've moved back home from living independently for 4 years. But ever since summer I haven't been able to shake this really heavy, sad feeling when, realistically, I have no reason to feel such a way. I feel like it's the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning, and the last thing I think about before I fall asleep.

I don't want to self diagnose myself but I've looked into depression and feel like a lot of the symptoms relate to how I've been feeling. My appetite totally disappeared last month however it's began to return recently, and I've been having a lot of dark thoughts. None of these I'm rationally going to carry through, but I've definitely thought about death and dying a lot more the past few months than I ever have before.

But I'm still able to function. I get up, go to work (I've found myself a stop gap hospitality job while I keep looking for something related to my degree) and socialise. In fact I feel like if I'm not doing something I end up wallowing in my own thoughts and feeling worse so I've been going out of my way to distract myself by meeting friends or doing stuff - even if that sometimes exhausts me and I end up totally zoning out from everyone around me or leaving and going home early. The typical stereotype of being depressed is not being able to get out of bed so I feel like, because I can get out of bed and function normally, that maybe I'm not depressed *enough* to actually be diagnosed. I know that's a stupid train of thought to have because what I've described is just a stereotype but when I can still laugh about things with people and appear happy I feel like a total fake.

Anyway, I have a doctor's appointment booked for next week. It's not about my mental health but actually about a bald patch that appeared on my head about 6 months ago. My barber says he thinks it's alopecia areata which can apparently be triggered by stress. I'm really just going to my GP to double check if it really is that, but I feel like it might give me an opportunity to mention how I've been feeling, especially if it might have been triggered emotionally. Should I bring it up? 

Apologies if this is a ramble. I've never really explained this to anyone so I don't quite know how to put it into words, I just wanted to get it out there and see if anyone had any thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I for one just hope I can get my mind off things with this and get back to work.


Backstory: 
I remember maybe 2 hours or so total of the first 18 years of my life most of which I'd decribe as traumatic although all in all I didnt get away too bad; rarely broken bones, probably not malnourished, at least a roof over my head and some education, I've heard far worse before. 


Probably went through 9 doctors and 7 therapists so far and none of them wanted to help me, they all just made things worse and/or traumatised me. Stuffing me full of drugs that made me sleep 20 hours a day and the other 4 hours I was too exhausting to even pay attention to videos. (Third time around) One tried to scare me by decribing in graphic detail burn victims that she knew with all the crispy yummy blisters and pus. Told her ""Thanks for traumatising me, you have issues"" or similiar and walked out. Spend Christmas and probably another half year in a ~~hospital~~ mental institute where they drugged me up as described and got frequently haressed by ~~inmates~~ patients as I was too weak to defend myself. The next time around I got luckier, staying at home 4 or so months sleeping 16 to 18 hours daily (my life is the worst I could imagine so why not sleep it away) spending every minute I can't sleep watching videos about what ever comes under my cursor. Third time around I was a bit stronger so I at close stand up for myself in one way or another but they didnt help me either, at least they didnt drug me up further. Some light drug from the first theraphy I had to endure I quit the day the doctor let me as I could not suffer one more day off it; I felt that numb. To finish off the backstory it might be worth it that I attempted suicide twice but was stupid enough to involve my mother, which rediculed me over it both times and I just forgot about it. For the third time I chose sleep which is the option for strong cowards which I am fine with.


Present day:
Everything started to get better when I droped out of school. I tried wasting time the best I can, playing MMOs and watching 16 hours of streams a day. It was incredibly frustrating, like being a runner with a broken leg, but after two years of this stalling, with the financial support of my mother I took a stance: 


I won't be sad anymore.


From there on things looked up. Everytime I was sad or destructive I'd just stop it right there and be happy instead. I spend another 4 months or so getting myself together and after feeling capable to live again I started playing fighting games and learning a third language. Just anything, anything productive that would pay dividends. Going from 20 minutes studying up to 8 hours now, depending on how I've been feeling (consequently quitting FGs). I have a consistent sleep schedule going to bed at ~6:10 and ~20:10 for a total of 6 to 8 (I really struggle to get my hours worth in the evening). If I've been a good boy I get maybe an hour or so of free time which is plenty. Any more and the misery sets in, costing me momentum for days to come. Potentially I have the next 9 years lined up aswell so it can't be too bad.


People seem to promote suffering and misery seeing that I've been haressed over making interested people aware of that option. I stand by my stance regardless, not being miserable is the best way to not be miserable. It is not an extreme stance to take in the slightest and it helped me so there is a chance it helps others aswell. Once you control the symptoms- Both mind and body are yours to manipulate and shape as you please, to ruin or nurture; your choice ripe for the taking.


I also have periods of severe lethargy and hyper activity. Two weeks are fine, then two or three days I get my 4 to 6 hour workload done in a mere hour and then just don't know what to do!!!! I can easily watch three streams at the same time while playing video games and listen to all three of them at the same time. To calm myself I often gnaw on my fingers and arms which does a fine job of grounding me. Then it's fine again for like two weeks, the next three days tho are a struggle. Can't get out of bed, when I do because of mobile games it takes me 6 hours to start working which then forces me to do crunch time in the second half. At least that teaches me that no matter how terrible I feel I just need to start doing it and things turn out fine. A consistent sleep schedule and a degenerate diet helped mitigate that alot. Attempting to track this only yielded inconsistent results so it is a rough estimate at best, actually caused by outside circumstances, and thus wrong at worst.


Big struggle with fear of missing out on things which haunts me every waking minute (and even when I sleep which explains why I can't sleep in the evening) but I deal with it to some degree. It manifests itself as recording conversations when I am gone and opening lots of browser tabs which ""I'll get to"" (Currently 105 tabs but it has been ~500 before). Also tons and tons of screenshots in games of avatars that I never look at, same with pictures I find online. My primary picture folder is  129GB big (24,7 on hard drive what ever that means) with a total of 11,245 files and 318 folders. It's a compulsion I manage to quench so I am fine enough.


I don't know what fun is. I don't feel joy. I simply opt to stick with whatever I deem important. That mentality has benefits of it's own as I don't rely on fluctuating things like motivation or passion. I just do things.


I am shutting myself off more and more, not going to the doc when sick (aforementioned bad experience with hospitals), not leaving my flat for weeks just ordering food online, not seeing or talking to anyone for months, not my mother no ""friends"" (I like to say no friends no problems so I stick with that). It's for the better other people are too hateful and stressful. I prefer to work. From time to time my body is lonely so I just turn on a stream for an hour or two. Luckily I am a NEET or otherwise thing would've turned out for the worse. Solitude is a highly valued luxury good and I am priviledged enough to have a surplus of it.


Of course I am still suicidal every moment I get my mind off work, now more than ever seeing how much I overwork myself.


I just want the self-inflicted pain to end but I know I can't stop I still have 27 days left after all so I'll give it my best. I am a coward so I'll be fine.


Life isnt easy but easy things arent worth it anyway.


This is the abridged version. As I said it's been a while since I had to sum it up as I just try to cut away the past the best I can like infected tissue.
I hope this post at least engaged a single person. Trusting that this is a positive subreddit, I'd be happy to answer any question and clear up any confusion.


EDIT: I've been documenting my study progress so if anyone is curious feel free to PM me. Also been keeping up a study focused dairy of sorts as I loathe personal dairies.

I *do* meditate twice a day right after waking up aka right before work, and then twice kinda meditation to force myself to sleep by surpressing thoughts.

22,"I really need help and I don’t know where to get it.

I had a lucid dream a week or two ago. I was okay the following day, but it’s been creeping up on me and it terrifies the fuck out of me.

It wasn’t a nightmare per se. it’s just that I knew I was asleep, that everything I was seeing wasn’t real, that I was completely alone and trapped in my own subjective reality. I was asking people in my dream for help, only to realize that I was just talking to myself because it was all a dream, and everyone was a hallucination. 



Edit: My alarm went off in real life and I knew it was going off in real life. The sound permeated my dream. Everyone was getting upset at me and it made me feel guilty even though I knew they weren’t real. I wanted to wake up so badly because my alarm going off meant I had some obligation to wake up and tend to in the real world. 

I kept trying to remember what it was. What I needed to wake up for. But I couldn’t remember anything about what the real world was like. Fuck it seriously messed with me.

I felt clinically insane. I felt like I knew I’d gone crazy and had no channel back to reality. I couldn’t ask for help. I had no access to the internet or any way of figuring out how to return to the real world.


Edit2: I feel like over the past 24 hours I’ve very quickly become depressed. I don’t know what the point of anything is. I have no motivation. Help me

Edit3: i realize that this was triggered more from a post I was reading through yesterday rather than the dream itself. It was a post on the front page about Alzheimer’s and dementia. People were telling stories about family members with dementia and it made life seem so pointless at first. What’s the point of enjoying any moment with my family when we’re all just gonna suffer and die when we’re older?

In addition to making me depressed, the descriptions of what dementia patients go through sounded too much like what my lucid dream felt like. People are experiencing what I experienced during one night *constantly*. And there’s nothing we can do for them.  That’s terrifying ",19Nov2018,1
23,"10+ year pattern in my life. What's going on?

Depression I'm defining as: No interested in or does not engage in hobbies. A general feeling of my soul being sucked out at all times. Over or undersleeping. Sense of being without purpose. Always feeling a little sad for no reason. I have some pretty bad ""resting depression face"". It really looks like genuine Depression.

But it's not ""Depression"" since it's only dependent on whether or not I'm stressed with anxiety. I'm only ""depressed"" when I'm not stressed.

Anxiety for me latches on to the MOST IMPORTANT THING I REALLY NEED TO BE DOING RIGHT NOW and is *insurmountable*. When I try to tackle what's making me anxious my behavior starts looking like severe ADHD. I avoid it by getting really busy with anything else that looks urgent, my task memory goes out the window, and my impulse control vanishes. But when I'm really anxious/stressed, my ""zest for living"" is back... so long as I'm avoiding the source of my anxiety.

**TL;DR** I've spent my adult life scared shitless of anything I really need to get done, but am outright depressed when my life is fine",19Nov2018,1

26,"**\*Note:** This is pretty long, but I hope you guys can help me out. There is a TL;DR at the end, but I do encourage reading/skimming through to get a complete understanding.\* 

My mom has become paranoid over the last 5 years. 

**The Background:**

It all began when a new family moved next door in the apartment building we lived in for 20 years. The family was very outwardly racist towards us and others in the neighborhood. It didn't start off like that, but after parking disputes (because free street parking is scarce in a large, urban city), it turned into nasty looks and arguments. At one point, my mom and the neighbor mom (NM) started arguing and NM pushed my mom, which led to a police call. After that, it all went downhill.

**The First Signs:**

One thing about the building we lived in is that the building was so old and the units were so close together that it was fairly easy to hear the neighbors talking. What they were saying wasn't clear unless we had a door or window open, but they spoke pretty loudly among themselves that would cause my mom to walk quietly towards the source of the sound and press her ear to the wall. She would try to make out what they were saying and tell me what she thought they said. I often told her to let it go and that it didn't matter what they said. Eventually, I began to see my mom crack the door open and hold her phone up to record their conversations. Then it progressed to peeking out the window and video recording them through the window if they were in front of the building. Again, I would get upset with her and tell her to stop worrying about them because what they would say didn't matter since they're just shitty people and almost everyone in the neighborhood hates them. This didn't stop her.

**The Progression:**

The toll of feeling trapped in our small one bedroom apartment was putting my mom on edge. She felt trapped because she couldn't leave the windows or doors open to let fresh air and light in. She loved to play music while cleaning or cooking, but because she didn't want to give the neighbors ammunition to complain to the landlord, she tried to stay quiet. She didn't invite friends over for the same reason. My mom is usually a friendly and bubbly person, so seeing her like this was frustrating. Still, I had hope that she would eventually get over it. That didn't happen and what did happen made my family and I realize that if we didn't do something soon, we would lose my mom. Basically, she began to say the neighbors, their relatives, and their friends that would visit were following her to work, the grocery store, the doctor, etc. She would look at the side view mirrors in the car as I drove her around and claim that we were being followed if there was a car that was going in the same direction for a bit. She would say that those same relatives and friends went into the restaurant she works at but that she would thankfully be in a different section that allowed her to stay hidden. She even started to say the neighbors were performing witchcraft on her (my mom is kind of a typical/very old school, religious and spiritual Latin lady) because they left a bucket of dirty water in the lobby or she thought she saw NM sprinkle something around our front door. 

**The Solution?:**

After 2-3 years of dealing with the neighbors, lack of parking, lack of space, and living in a building that was literally falling apart (the ceiling came down in our living room and fell on my f\*cking piano but whatevs), I told my family it was time to move. I didn't specify the mental health part to my mom, but my dad and brothers knew this was a big factor as to our move. I went house hunting for weeks, but had zero luck. I had mentioned moving to the building's landlady and because she liked us, made sure one of the homes she was working on with her partner was for us. Its a small house in the same city and the climate of the neighborhood is fairly the same (people throwing loud parties on the weekends; neighbors drinking and blasting their music from their cars; ""is it a gunshot or firework"" sounds) but because we like to keep to ourselves and mind our business, we have had no problems at all since living here. Its 3 bedrooms and there is another home on the property (its a house turned into an apartment right behind us that is also the same building where our garage is. Basically they turned the two story house into an upstairs house which \[which is actually super nice and still massive 3 bed,2 bath, amazing view, etc\], cut off the downstairs den and made that into a separate studio). The family living behind us is so amazing, especially the young mother of three who has helped my mom in trusting strangers again. She would go out to breakfast with her or run errands together. She even started calling my mom ""mom"" and they are very close. Her husband is a quiet guy but he is also nice. The other neighbor that lives in the studio is a friend of the landlady and is friendly as well although we don't talk much. However, he likes to grow his own vegetables in his backyard and often offers us corn, squash, pumpkin, etc and in turn we make him some baked goods. So all in all, its been great and yet.....

**The Ongoing:**

My mom has definitely gotten ""better"". She is happier and she is free to do whatever she wants in the comfort of her own home. She has her own front yard and started gardening, she plays her music and uses her karaoke machine with my dad on some date nights (super cute to see), and she doesn't seem so tense as before. HOWEVER, she still tells me things that show her paranoia is still there and in a way its worse. Yes, it doesn't happen as often as before and she isn't shuffling to the front door or windows to peek on the neighbors, but her claims of being followed are a lot worse, especially since there is not a specific person with a personal grudge she can point to. She told me last week that she had a customer at the restaurant who complained about the food (the customer went to talk on the phone outside for 20-30 minutes, leaving her daughter at the table, after the food was served so of course it was going to be cold). My mom said the customer was weird, especially about her phone. This caused my mom to think the customer was sent by someone to spy on her at work. Then earlier today she told me she thinks she is being followed/investigated as a part of my brother's Army service. I know the military does background and security checks on their people and their families, so of course its not far fetched, but I also know that those checks are usually done in response to someone moving up/becoming involved in classified things that require certain levels of clearance/needing to renew your clearance or general check/yearly for certain government jobs. At this time, I know for a fact my brother is not going through any of these and my boyfriend (who is also military/government worker) is not either. Even more, I'm sure my 4'10"", 50 year old mom with developing arthritis is the last person the FBI/military is going to be investigating. The fact that her claims are continuing and in a way more outlandish than before is concerning me. 

**The Ask for Help:**

I thought moving would help my mom get better and in a way it has and I am well aware that because her paranoia/anxiety grew to the extent it did it might take some time. Nonetheless, I am worried that she might revert back to that time or that her claims will get worse although not as common as before. I am unsure if I should have her seek professional help, especially because she is so old school that suggesting seeing a therapist/psychiatrist will infuriate her because 1) she thinks it means she is crazy and 2) she doesn't believe in mental disorders that aren't ""severe"" like autism, schizophrenia, etc. Knowing her reaction is also another reason why I am hesitant to bring it up to her so that in case she decides not to seek professional help, she can do something at home to help herself. My other concern is that if she doesn't see a doctor, we won't know if this is circumstantial/as a result of stressful event(s) or genetic/brain chemistry. 

**The Overall Questions:**

My question, Reddit, then, is how can I approach my mom about my concerns for her mental health? How can I support her if she refuses to seek professional/medical help? What signs/symptoms should I look out for in case it gets much worse or if it starts to seem like its a brain/genetic thing rather than a cause-and-effect issue?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** My mom has developed paranoid thoughts that stemmed from living next to racist/shitty neighbors 5 years ago for 2-3 years. We moved to a new/better home, and although she doesn't express her paranoia as much as before, her claims are much more out there. Specifically, it went from ""neighbors are always talking shit about me"" to ""the neighbors and their people are following me everywhere I go"" to ""the neighbors are doing witchcraft"" and finally to ""I think I'm being followed/investigated by someone or the FBI."" I don't know how to tell her she needs help since ***she doesn't really believe in mental disorders***. I'm worried it might get worse or that it could be a brain chemistry thing. **How do I approach her? How do I help her if she refuses treatment? What signs should I look out for to see if it gets worse or to see if its more than just stress/circumstantial  (aka brain imbalance)?**",19Nov2018,1

I’m therefore a drain on everyone. I have no purpose, and I have no future. I want to kill myself because I want to free myself from being useless, and also because I want to free my fiancé (has everything going for him) from being with someone like me (no future). I could just break up with him, but I don’t want to exist if I can’t be with him. 
I’ve even planned the details of what I want to do and how I would do it. I’m just proving to be too much of a wimp to actually go out and buy the gun (I hate guns, but overdosing has a very small success rate when it comes to suicide). 
I guess I’m writing here because no one else seems to care much. I told my fiancé about it last night, and he acted like he cared, but then proceeded to play games on his phone until we went to bed.

I say that I don’t like this shirt because of how tight it looks, making me think about the things I don’t like about my body. Immediately, the fact that I’m super hungry does not matter, I can’t make myself finish my burger. I left the not even half eaten burger on the plate and tried not to cry.

33,"I have low self-esteem, I’m socially withdrawn, I’m detached and anxious most of the time, I have severe shifts in thoughts and moods, I get very depressed, I have flashbacks of all the shit I have been put through. It's killing me it's making my mind lose everything. I don’t know who I am anymore. I keep thinking. I’m going to die young I don’t know why. 

I literally have no friendships and no romantic relationships. I'm skeptical of EVERYONE and EVERYTHING. Impulsive behavior/ reckless spending, over-eating, starving myself and being numb most the time just to name a few. I always think people dislike me/don't care about helping me or anyone and just care about themselves and money. I have angry outbursts and hate being forced to do things because of my past. And I have suicidal thoughts, I sometimes wish I could wake up and be someone else. 

I have a family history of Mental Health Disorders which makes me more likely to have something.

I was bullied in primary school so badly, I would pull on my hair, hit myself, and cry my eyes out every day after school I couldn’t take it I just wanted to leave and not come back so I used to have lots of time off school which caused me to have a very low attendance and then when leaving primary to go to secondary school. 

I was still being bullied but it got worse I was hit, kicked and emotionally abused by people, I think something seriously bad happened to me because since then I have lost most of my childhood memories and changed me I was a different person after that and my friends turned their backs on me (Basically I think people need to teach their children not to bully because it can mess up people’s lives completely). 

I was and still am impulsive these are just some of the thing I do/used to do:

•	Going on spending sprees
•	Binge eating
•	Screaming at others horrible things (Which I don't mean so I don't know why I say them)
•	Threatening to harm people (Which I also don't mean)
•	Self-harm
•	Destroying property, mine or anything close by. (After makes me feel awful)
•	Shoplifting (when I was younger)
•	Getting into physical conflicts with people (I hate fighting or at least I think I do)

Here are the things that upset me / make me angry:
•	Getting yelled at 
•	Receiving Criticism 
•	Embarrassment
•	Hearing things said about me true or not (I take everything personally)
•	Doing something impulsive which causes me to hurt myself or others
•	Being abandoned
•	Places that bring back negative memories
•	Reminders of traumatic things that have happened to me
•	Rejection (of any kind)
•	Loss of friends
•	Ending of a relationship/friendship
•	Seeing pictures of people on nights out or meeting with people.
•	People not responding to me in a timely manner because I think people are ignoring me.

Once I was talking to someone just saying “Hey, how are you doing today?”
Then they replied back saying ""I don’t want to be rude, but I don’t have any time right now to talk” 

I got really upset because of this so I cried for like an hour and kept looking at the message over and over upsetting myself.
A little while later I replied with ""Are you mad at me?"" and they responded with ""No, of course, I’m not"". 

Then I was sitting in my room thinking “was that sarcasm? I don’t know if it was I think they hate me??”  and having extreme attacks of loneliness and feeling that they don’t like me anymore.

What's wrong with me I'm scared and alone and the NHS is taking so long to help me I don't know what to do :(

35,"You know how you meet your friends or s/o's family and you realize where a lot of their personality traits come from? Their quirks, sayings and a lot of who they are? Well when I was a middle schooler up and through college I was suffering with depression. (I'm doing better now!) This depression caused me to isolate myself a lot from friends and family. I've realized I don't share a lot of views or traits, besides the physical, with my family and close friends. 

My theory is that by isolating myself, reading, thinking, mediating, working out and over all.spending a lot of time by myself, that I learned about myself better than most. I know who I am. I share some quirks with people I hold close but it's less than the average person. I am my own person. And I really really like that. 

Now I'm not saying ""depression is great!"" Or hoping anyone wants depression after seeing this but it's a small silver lining on an otherwise big grey cloud for other people who have depression like me.

36,"For years I have been struggling with being incredibly inconsistent at doing certain tasks such as talking or typing, my inconsistency problems are more apparent when it comes to playing games. I'm a huge gamer, it sounds cringy but it's true that I've been playing PC games since I was like 8 maybe younger I cant really remember. As people switch from game to game they develop skills that cross over especially for FPS games. Knowing that I've been playing games for such a long time you would think that these skills might have gotten very good and they have, the problem is, I can't seem to ever be consistent while playing. I feel like I'm having a mental break down every time I play in public matches, It's impossible to find the right mindset (which I think is my problem) that will help me overcome my inconsistency. I've come up with so many false fixes to my problem such as holding my mouse in a certain way, putting more effort into aiming, and even focusing on how my hand feels. Although I think I have found the perfect way to think while gaming it's impossible to switch into a mindset of confidence in my ability when for years I have been doubting my ability to do anything, also how am I supposed to apply that mindset to other tasks?

I remember coming across this very interesting and helpful Reddit post that talked about the conscious and subconscious part of the human brain and I think it made what my problem is much clearer. It talked about how the subconscious brain is much better at preforming complicated tasks than the conscious and how the wrong type of thinking can cause you to use your conscious brain to perform tasks. He compared the conscious brain to the RAM component of a computer it is designed for short term data storage and to quickly review, process and discard new information.

It’s like she’s also in some form of denial, and if she hears me say I need help, then all of our shared hopes and dreams will crumble. But mine are already crumbling and I need someone to support me.

41,"For the last few months I haven't been feeling like myself.  I'm a 19 y/o male and around the beginning of June, I began to act way different than I used to.  I used to spend time with my grandparents at least 4 times per week, and for the last few months I'll go sometimes 2 weeks without seeing them and barely talking to them, which isn't normal for me.  Over the last few weeks I've noticed it's gotten worse.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have no desire to do much of any of the activities that I used to almost grind, in a sense.  I used to play lots of video games, to which the last \~3 weeks I've barely played at all. I used to go to the gym every other day, and now I only go maybe once per week and only for maybe an hour when I used to stay for at least 2-3.  I've began to fall behind on my studies like turn in my homework late or just copy answers for it off of google, without any regard to actually learning the stuff I need to learn.  I will make plans to do stuff with friends and be tempted to cancel last minute, which I don't end up doing but I'll sit around and just watch the clock until everythings over and it's time to go home.  All I feel like doing is laying in bed and watching YouTube on my phone or going on Twitter.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I don't feel sad or bummed about much.  Whenever I talk to friends, I act normal like nothings wrong and I don't put on any act to hide how I feel or anything.  It's just how I normally act.  The only thing that I can think of that's really had me bummed out lately is a situation with a girl (whole different story), but I really don't think that's the reason since I've been acting different long before I even met her.  

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that it could be stress with all the things going on in my life, but I've never had an issue with dealing with stress before.  I'm just confused as to what the hell is going on with me.  I've had a few friends make comments on it, specifically why I don't feel like doing things that I used to, and I haven't really spoken in depth to anyone about what's going on in my head.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm obviously not looking for any type of diagnosis, but I just want some answers as to what COULD be going on.

43,"It started about a week ago. I was watching something online, and this racist, negative thought about black people came into my head. I mean, I've never lived around a lot of black people or in a place where this kind of racism is predominant.  I've had a handful of good friends that are black throughout my life. Since then, when I see a black person on TV, I'm like... noticing it, and kind of being negative about it. Honestly, I feel pretty disgusted typing this out. A couple days later, I even found myself having a negative thought about gay people. My roommates are gay, I'm a little queer myself .... wtf is happening to me. 

I'm definitely disturbed by it, but I'm wondering if it has to do with me following the news and politics too much. For example, I've been curious how it could be possible for people to be so hateful and racist in this country. Now all of a sudden, these dark thoughts have kind of infected me. 

Also, I just turned thirty recently, and have been feeling pretty bad about myself. I was okay with myself before, but turning this age made me feel like I'm kind of pathetic and a failure, and I'm not impressed with what I've done in life all of a sudden. Is this some kind of weird, hateful projection?

Does anyone have any insight into this? ",19Nov2018,1

46,"Ok, so I am a student so I am very low income and am basically on medicare that my state offers. I tried seeking help for my chronic depression and anxiety at my school’s mental health clinic and the therapist basically told me they don’t have the resources and shamed me for being on low-income insurance. She was rude and condescending, so I got discouraged and stopped looking for awhile. 

Then I found a good sounding clinic in my neighborhood and reached out to them. They told me they take my insurance and to contact their scheduler. I have contacted them at least a dozen times and had my PCP send over a referral, but have gotten no contact from them.

49,"Just warning if anyone actually reads this: I am writing all over the place but it's late at night, so I can't really fix it. I am sure to miss some details in the story, sorry if I do.

I have been wanting to vent about this to someone for a long time but have never had anyone to talk to. I have never posted anything on the internet about this issues for fear of being recognized and criticized. 

A little about me. I have grown up in a religious family in the Midwest. I was homeschooled until high school because of my parent's negative beliefs in the school system. I have enjoyed and played sports my entire life, it has been a really good getaway from all my issues. I am currently 21 and a senior in college.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been quiet for as long as I can remember. My family used to call me shy and said it was because I was ""Smart."" When I was younger, I was also very sensitive I would often get called something by someone jokingly and take it seriously and get really upset. My mother was very sheltering during these times. If something went wrong, she would be protective about calling coaches or my friends parents and confronting them about my problems. Another thing I remember from my childhood is that my parents were concerned with how I wanted everything to be ""perfect"". Most of my life I've done things by the book. My parents took me to counseling after one event when I threw a fit because someone cheated in a board game, also they were concerned because I would get really upset if my homework and test scores were not 100%, and also claimed that I wanted to make everything a competition (this is true, I love competition.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have had very limited friendships throughout my life. I have never had to do any work to get my friends either, they all either approached me or it just came together. Most of my ""friends"" were made only from spending a lot of time in sports.  All these people are more acquaintances more than friends because I never hang out with them outside of activities. I am also really good at ending friendships, I just can't keep them. They all end because I'm either too boring, stop contacting, sometimes I'm just an asshole and stopped talking to them forever over a small fight, or some other reason that they don't wanna be around me. I have only had one real friend in my life that I would consider my best friend. We would hang out and do everything together for 6 years. Things ended when I got mad at him and told him I didn't want to talk to him ever again. Months later, we moved and I lost contact with him. To this day that is probably the biggest regret I've ever had because I haven't had a best friend since then. I have wanted to have a girlfriend for a long time but have never talked to any girls. I am worried that if I am not fixed soon then I will be alone for the rest of my life. Many people think that I am asexual or gay based on the fact that I never talk to any girls, that isn't the truth. There are many reasons why I haven't talked with any but mostly that I am very awkward and don't want them to deal with it.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that I have always prided myself in is how hard I work. I always want to put in the extra effort to be the best (I am very competitive). I will often spend many more hours studying than anyone else just to be the best. When I was in the 5th grade began reading and watching motivational speakers, videos, audiobooks, articles. I wanted to know what it takes to be the very best at what I do. I think that this all strives from this huge fear of failure, wasting my life, going through life and not doing anything. I am extremely scared of going through life and it being for nothing. I also don't want to be ridiculed and have a bad reputation. I have always been known for working hard and doing the right thing. I am scared of letting down my old teachers or coaches who have used me an example of what to do.  I have many urges to do things that most people do and are normal but don't just for this very reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto what I believe to be the biggest issue that I have, my anxiety. I have what I would consider severe anxiety. I believe that I have General Anxiety Disorder because I have had it my whole life. I also think that I have Social Phobia and Avoidance personality disorder because I have almost all of the symptoms. I missed at least 20-30 classes a year in school just because I was so anxious about going or having to deal with a certain situation. These have caused me many times not to speak up or join a conversation even when I have something to say. One thing that I have noticed personally is that my parents got separated and divorced 2 years ago and my anxiety got 1000x worse when that happened. My family was the only people that I felt comfortable around and could be myself. Now the relationships have been completely ruined and I don't feel like there is anyone I can be myself around. I have the biggest issue talking in large groups of multiple people. I can talk fine 1 on 1 with someone, though it may not be the most fluid conversation because of how awkward I am. It's kinda weird because if I write a speech and prepare it, then I can do fine talking in front of a large group of people. If I am put on the spot though, I will freeze up and not know what to say. In large groups of 5-6 people or more in a conversation setting, I don't usually talk and just stay quiet and listen. Also in professional settings, I can force myself to talk to people. I feel extremely uncomfortable when I do, but in both my customer service jobs I could recite a script of what to say to customers with no problems. Also dealing with this is being in person or not. I can't understand why but in person I am terrible at coming up with responses and thinking of what to say. In text messages or email or online, I can respond very quickly and have thoughtful conversations easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Another symptom that I have always had issues with is my eyes. they are always puffy like where they cover half my eyes and I have huge dark circles. My eyes look sunk in and heavy as you would expect of someone who hadn't slept in a week. I also feel like they are heavy its like there's a weight on the top of my eyes and on the bags underneath my eyes also. I have an issue with eye contact, not like I can't do it, but it feels unnatural. I look at myself in the mirror and when I stare at my eyes they just have a glossy look to them. I have learned that eye contact is important when talking and I can do that but I feel like I'm being judged and I never know how much eye contact is too little or too much. I had someone suggest to me that I have Asperger but if I did I would have a higher functioning case of it because I don't have all the symptoms. With my eyes while it may not be natural for me I feel like if I am focusing on it it is not a huge problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to get my brain and everything else fixed really really badly. I would give anything just to be normal. In the future I want to have a wife and kids and have a successful job. I read a book this past summer on success and it said a quote that I think about every day. It was something along the lines of everyone has a disability and it will be the biggest obstacle in achieving your goals. I realize how much of a disability my brain is to me. There are 2 reasons why I have never gotten professional help for this. first, my parents don't believe in mental illnesses I have complained to them about the issues I've written about several times and every time they just tell me that its all in my head and made up. They took me to see a therapist once but it wasn't to fix my issues it was because I wasn't behaving the way they wanted. the second reason why I haven't gotten help is because of funding. I am a broke college student who can't even afford to pay for groceries. My school doesn't offer any counseling (I've looked). Even if they did, I don't think I could bring myself to go because I don't want someone to see me getting help. It has been very hard to ask for any help  for me. When I ask for help it usually means that I am on my last resort and I have done everything in my power to resolve the issue. I have spent countless hours researching this and I just want to be fixed. If there were some operation to fix my issues in trade of losing my right hand, I would do it in a heartbeat.

If anyone has had any similar problems, what has worked for you? Is there anything I can do to get better or at least lessen the effects? Is there no hope for me? If you have any questions for me feel free to ask them and I will try to answer them.

51,"I started DBT a few weeks ago. At first I really liked the psychologist there. I felt like she really cared about me, was good at her job, and I finally felt optimistic about getting better.

But now I'm sitting here thinking all she wants is money. She just wanted me to join the skills group to get more money because thats probably what her boss wanted her to do. She doesn't really care if I get better. She is just fake and acts like she cares. Of course she would tell me I should join the group also, It's an extra $100 a week they get there! All she fucking cares about is money. Nobody cares, there's no hope for myself because all therapists want is money and they all have ulterior motives and they really dont give a shit if I get better or not.

61,"Hello everyone. Long story short - longtime sufferer of anxiety and panic. Severe health anxiety. Around 10 years. Several years ago I started on Lexapro and it worked well for me, but under the supervision of my doctor I tapered off slowly at the end of last year/beginning of this year.

I've also had a drinking problem over the past several years. I was never a daily drinker. Always just someone who liked to drink to excess. This kind of behavior has been dramatically reduced over the years, to the point now where I very rarely slip up, feel bad about it, re-commit to sobriety.

15 days ago I slipped up and drank beer all day at my apartment. In a 10 hour span or so I drank 15 beers. I woke up with a hangover in the middle of the night and felt awful about it. I suffered some mental anguish over the fact that despite committing myself to sobriety, I slip-up occasionally and drink.

Something happened to me that day and I haven't been the same since. I basically had a nervous breakdown of some kind. I was initially concerned I had brain damage from drinking all that beer that day but I've had incessant reassurance both on reddit and speaking to doctors that I don't.

15 days later, my head still feels empty. I can't feel happiness or any positive emotion. It's like there's a giant hole there. I'm also having constant anxiety. My stomach hurts from all the anxiety, and I'm not eating well. I can't think clearly or speak articulately. I can't concentrate on reading. I feel like I'm absolutely broken.

I think I can put aside the brain damage anxiety. But clearly my panic disorder has completely shattered me and I'm not sure how to move forward. I obviously want to heal but it's been 15 days and every night I pray that I wake up and feel normal again like I did a mere couple weeks ago and I don't. I'm told the brain heals everyday but I need relief now.

Please reassure me I can heal and feel normal again.

I know everybody is saying no, but would the alcohol I drank on the 3rd have caused some physical change in my brain that put me in this state permanently?

Or did my anguish over my failed sobriety trigger a major depressive episode?

If I schedule an appointment with a doctor, what are some treatment options for me? Would you guys recommend that or is it possible to heal without medication?",19Nov2018,1

I haven’t been in a particularly bad mood in the past couples weeks if anything just tired or lazy. I also have stayed up all night just because I’m not tired or due to trying to sleep but being unable to at least 5 times in the past 3 weeks. In general I’m still in a decent mood though just sometimes out of it when I haven’t slept well. I feel pretty normal besides these odd behaviors and haven’t had any serious mental health issues since I came out of depression about 2 years ago. Nothing really bad is going on in my life right now so maybe it’s just normal to feel good most of the time. I just started my freshman year out of state in college and have made lots of great friends, I came out as bisexual to most of the people that I care about and it went well, I’ve been going on dates with this great girl, and my grades are actually decent. I haven’t been more aggressive or risky, but I have found that since coming here I’ve been so much more outgoing than I’ve ever been in my life. I also feel quite a bit of anxiety from time to time, but it’s all related to the amount of school work I have. I’m just scared because I may feel a little bit too good.

I am 23 years old, soon 24. I am a very large, mostly unattractive male living in the US. I have never been fully diagnosed for any mental health conditions (outside of ADHD) because I have never seen a doctor about it. I don't feel comfortable going to my family doctor because the family doctor I see is very critical of my weight problem that I have; I have struggled with my weight since elementary school and they bring it up every single time I go, repeating the lines ""you need to eat better and exercise more"" and offer nothing outside of that. I have been on several diets and tried several times to make routine exercise plans and everything has failed. They don't believe me, and it makes me feel like shit. I rarely go to the doctors now simply because I want to avoid them.

&amp;#x200B;

For most of my life, my relationship with my parents has been pretty bad. My father is an up-and-coming alcoholic and is best described as a heartless asshole most days, and my mom is manipulative and enjoys starting drama with me over the smallest things. I currently live with them because I cannot afford to move out yet due to student loans and my currently low salary. My current job is working in a technical support call center, and it has been destroying my mental health lately. I have trouble controlling my anger, and this job has been exacerbating my anger to a new level. We are very understaffed (we had 5-6 people quit/get fired in the past 5 months in my department), the pay is not all that great compared to the work we are required to do, and clients/other vendors are very nasty to us usually. I've had blowups several times at work recently; my manager had to pull me aside about it two weeks ago because it was such a problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friends know that something has been wrong with me recently but I don't feel that they are concerned at all about it. I've brought up my mental health with them several times but they only really give the ""That sucks"" replies and one of my friends even told me that my feelings were invalid because I was never clinically diagnosed with anything yet. Yet they are all openly communicating their mental health with each other and are very understanding with each other.

We were in an LDR and we broke up because she had grievances with the relationship but refused to communicate with me properly about it after I asked many times for her to communicate with me more and be more open with me about her feelings. She agreed we could ""still be friends"" after we broke up and that she just needed a little space for now. We didn't talk for a month and eventually I could tell that she did not want to be friends, so I removed her off my social media. 2 weeks ago I found out that she had already moved on and met someone new. I had a severe panic attack that night and had extremely strong suicidal thoughts for the first time since high school; it was possibly one of the worst mental breakdowns I had ever experienced in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all of the above taken into account, I feel incredibly broken and hopeless. I don't think my life will get better from here and I've mostly given up seeking help because I don't feel like it is worth seeking at this point and I don't feel like it will help at this point. The suicidal thoughts have subsided for the time being but I constantly have thoughts of wishing I was dead and that something would come along and kill me already. I don't feel any motivation or actual happiness outside of short few-second bursts here and there. I feel like I'm just riding some shitty wave and waiting for it to crash and drown me already. I don't really know what to do; I don't feel any motivation to make myself better because I personally don't care for it and I have no friends and family that genuinely want me to get better. What should I do, at this point?

I'll visualize who she slept with, how I found out, what I did, where I spent the night after, talking to a divorce lawyer, the whole thing. All the while getting angrier and angrier. Then when I get to work I'm pissed off and can't concentrate on work all day. 

This also happens the other way. I'll imagine starting an incredibly successful business, or everyone I know dieing. Which makes me happy or depressed all day. If it happens at night I can't sleep.

72,"I’m a seventeen year old male, in the past year it’s became clear to me that I suffer from some form of mental illness but because of my parents I can’t get any sort of help from a therapist or doctor. I have a history of panicking attacks, self harming, depersonalization, auditory and visual hallucinations and extremely suicidal thoughts but what happened to me last night was very different from anything before. Yesterday a few things happened to put me on edge but by night time I felt okay, then I got a call and was told something which made me anxious, I hung up and talked myself into it being okay but then my body like gave in to a panic attack. As I started to calm down again I felt very weak and lightheaded, and here’s where it gets confusing... I started having very violent intrusive thoughts in my head about ripping my arm muscles off. (I’m sorry to this part but I’m trying to say it all) suddenly my mind felt like it was out of my body which has happened before. But suddenly if I didn’t clench and lock all of my muscles my hands would start moving up to my face and my body was trying to pull out my eyes or do other violent things. Although I’ve had self harming issues in the past this wasn’t that because i has zero control over this it wasn’t like  my brain was telling my body to do this. I was extremely scared if I got exhausted and couldn’t clench my muscles or if I fell asleep my body would destroy itself. I felt like I was in a puppet that some one else controlled. I was in a fetal position crying and panicking during this. After maybe 25 minutes I felt control over my body but than another panic attack happened followed by another wave of no body control, the same thing happened but this one was scarier and if I closed my eyes I was seeing spiders and hearing their legs and also seeing them in my peripheral vision when I opened my eyes (there wasn’t actually any) once again I regained control of my body then had a strange calm the rest of the night. I had not been drinking or any form of drugs or medication nor have I been for quite awhile. I woke up very concerned and scared and even though I hate sharing this I hope some one has a insight on what that could have been?",19Nov2018,1

79," (I will try to keep it short as possible) I don't know if I have depression or something else. Let's dive in into my worldish.  
Mum and dad were divorce since I was born. Dad had my sister and I on weekdays, mum had us on weekends and holidays. 2012 (I was 12 years old), mum made us stop seeing dad because of things he has done... One things I remember a few nights before mum decided to keep us in her care 24/7 was when dad said ""you will never do anything right"" and all that... (that really screwed up with my 12 year old mind and still has). 2013ish dad took us to court (fighting over custody) and my sister (14) and me (13) had to talk to a child-lawyer-person-thingy. I think about it now, and she asked the same questions over and over except each time different ways which I wasn't aware of till now. 

  
""Would you like to see your dad"", ""do you miss him"", ""would you mind seeing him over skype"", ""would you mind seeing him if a friend was with you""  
I honestly wasn't the smartest kid then, but yeah...

&amp;#x200B;

There was a time where mum asked ""why did you the child-lawyer-person-thingy said that you have to see dad and not your sister?"" and I responded ""maybe because I said it was fine to see him over skype"" and that's when she pretty much swore at me the first time and it kinda hit me. She won the fight and took custody, but it honestly got worse from there. I also remember opening my PC at that time and found a message saying (from my dad to mum) ""(my name) is slow and needs attention"". I know that doesn't sound like he is hurting me or anything, but I don't know.. combining that plus the things he said to me, saying ""I can't do anything right"" didn't really made me feel very great. Anyways, mum kept swearing and pretty much went along with social norm talk saying 'sh\*t, c\*nt, fu\*k, b\*tch' and all. There wasn't a time where I remember her not swearing. I remember cutting my first time and my mum and step dad saw it as it was on my arms. Instead of asking me what's wrong, they say ""do you want to be locked up in a mental institution"", ""you can go to jail"" ""you won't come back out"" and all that. That screwed me up thinking about it now, cause nothing has changed. Mum always liked to make me feel guilty like that.  
At the end of 2014, we moved up and into a smaller town (we used to live in a big city). Fast forward, I got cheated on twice-ish (The second girl we were basically dating, but she still had things going on with her ex) but anyways, the first girl really screwed with my heart. As soon as I moved to the down (grade 9), I remember seeing her and thinking ""she is cute... maybe I should date her?"" (I know super cringy and yeah, I shouldn't have said that without actually knowing her). But it took 24ish weeks (or 2nd term in school) for me to actually talk to her and become her best friend. We basically dated around the forth term of school and she was my first love. Everyone knew we liked each other and yeah... When she cheated on me, I was so heart broken but after time, I somehow manage to become a brick wall and ignore her out of my life. Grade 10 was basically the highlight of my school years as I've made a group with 20+ friends and we were all pretty much a like and try to go out all the time. Our group consists of (sorry if this sounds rude or sterotypical) gym junkies, people who watch anime all day or game all day, people who dance, people who had depression or anger issues, people who socialised and people who didn't. One thing that we all pretty much had in common is that we all had split/divorced parents. We were all different in our own unique ways, yet I honestly see them all as family. I'd help every single one of them and listened when they had a problem and I cared for each one. Jumping a bit further, at the end of grade 10 I was like 'screw it, invite my first girlfriend that I love to your birthday' (birthday is December and I was moving back to a large city again)  
(Sorry if that was irrelevant, but maybe that has something to do of whats wrong with me)   


Okay this new school was super different. No one was as welcoming as the other school. I assumed cause two years till graduation and everyone is comfortable where they are which makes sense. But six weeks straight I just wondered around the school trying to not be noticed I was alone. I felt depressed (not saying I have depression) and actually felt suicidal again and what triggered it more is being asked ""have you made any friends"" every single damn day by my mum. The air here was completely different. Everyone partied, drank alcohol and smoked and not many people did all that where I used to live in the smaller town so I didn't fit in that well. Fast forward I have a girlfriend, it was super super awkward (like two 12 year olds saying they like each other on text but can't face each other irl) and at the athletic carnival the first thing she said was ""oh come, let's go see the hot exchange students"". Yeah, that screwed me up really bad but yeah... Anyways when we fought I would always blame myself even when it was her fault. That went on around 5 months and I guess I kinda bottled the feelings and exploded at her which hurt me. Anyways...  


Start of this year I had heaps of shit. Okay two massive flaws I noticed was that:  
1. I always felt bad. Legit, if there was extra food from work left over they'd ask me to have it and I always said ""oh i feel bad, what about the other people"" and all

2. NEVER stand up for myself. I never do, even with the simplest things. Fast food order is wrong, I feel ""too bad"" to ask them that they got it wrong and I want the meal I ordered.

3. Very very very low confidence in my ability.

4. Very bad memory.

This flaws affected me very heavily, mainly working. If I screwed up, it will be in the back of my mind and EVERYONE in work will notice (as I try my hardest to be a bubbly, happy person at work each day). I'm quiet a fast worker in the restaurant, but when I make a mistake, I feel like everyone is judging me and I feel as if one mistake is fifty, or even one hundred mistakes. My manager had a talk with me and said I am in the top 6 of people she thought were good workers (the other 5 was there before me so I can't really surpass them). She said that I am a good worker and told me to improve, I need to have more confidence in what I say. For example, I sometimes say customers ""sorry I might have to ask that to a superior, hold on one sec please"" even though I know the answer. (I like to make sure, so I don't make mistakes.  


Graduation night. Okay I screwed here I admit. All the graduates were given flowers to give to ""people who have supported you and blah blah blah"". I didn't think of anyone, but I chose my maths teacher cause she saved me from actually not graduating. There was a point in the night were all walking the graduates were walking and there were crowds of people on the left and right of us (as if we are walking on red carpet or something) and I followed the crowd. Mum was closest to the door and saw me and gave me a hug and kissed me and I was like ""not now mum, I'll be back"" and walked off. Okay, I was legit following the crowd because that was what everyone was doing and I felt bad for holding up the people behind I thought there was something on the end of space. I walked and I saw friends parents were there and we talked. Then saw girlfriend mum and we talked-ish (it was honestly super awkward). Had to go cause parents pulled me out. Mum legit took 50 photos and then I said I have to go and pack up the instruments (I performed a song with the band). Went back in car and my sister texted me saying ""mums crying"". Got to house, mum locked her door and I went to room. Step dad comes in saying ""you got to apoligise to mum. She's going to cop the sh\*t to all of us if you don't apoligise. She'll crack the sh\*t at all of us"". I don't get a choice cause my step dad will keep bothering me and my mum really does blame her anger/sadness at everyone, so if one person screws up in the family, we ALL get the blame. I couldn't apoligise cause she wouldn't open after knocking a billion times. I then called my girlfriend (which we do daily every night) and checked up on her. She cried on the phone and she told me it was because she had literally no friends and she was waiting to take photos with a friend but she was occupied with her closer friends. I thought about it and I was hurt. Very hurt and I felt so sorry for my girlfriend because I emphasised easily. I started the school with no friends and she graduated with none. It hurt a lot because I saw heaps of images of people graduating and heaps of photos with friends and I guess I really just felt hurt and sorry for my gf...  


I apoligised to my mum the next day and at first and went horribly. Two hours later I did it again and got a massive lecture. Mostly because ""I gave the flower to the wrong person"" and ""I pushed mum away for my girlfriend"". Mum started crying at first and randomly changed her mood to the trying-to-make-you-feel-bad mood. (says sarcastically) ""Oh your teacher wasn't there when you were born"", ""if your girlfriend and I were drowning, you would save her"" and all that. This mixed with how my brain thought was a very bad mixture. I took this to heart. She also said she's disappointed, I'm intentionally trying to hurt her, she's there for me when I'm low (which isn't the case as I'm writing this reddit post) and I have no emotions. After all the lectures I cried because she made me feel like pure sh\*t. And then she says ""crying is dumb"", ""you're not the one who got hurt"", ""i'm suffering from depression from yesterday"" (&lt;--- I do not believe that line and i find it very false). Anyways, she also said ""don't cry here, you can't do anything"". And that is when I remember my dad's line ""you can't do anything right""...  
Anyways my mum wants me to go to uni asap, but I want a gap year. No not because my girlfriend is having  one, but because I always wanted one ever since grade 7. But now, I have a reasonable reason on why I should. I want to further my skills in what I love doing (music) and then I want to go to uni. I personally think judging from my music class, is that I have tough competition even though it was a class of less then 10 people. I want a gap year to increase my skills guitar, piano, vocally, composing and musical theory. Throughout the last two months, mum nagged me about it and I kept ignoring the question on what I wanted or where I wanted to go. There were 3 times basically where my mum said no.  


\#1   
Mum - what do you wanna do after highschool  
Me - \*doesn't respond\*  
Sister (with joking tone of voice) - he wants a gap year  
Mum - don't put words and thoughts in his head  
Mum then gives sister a lecture and tells me not to listen to her  
 

\#2 (I was shouting my mum lunch)  
Mum - what do you want to do in uni  
Me (joking tone) - I want a gap year  
Mum (angrily) - No you're not taking a gap year  


\#3 literally 3 hours ago (mum was in a good mood, so I tried to tell her)  
Mum - baby, your sister and I are here to support you always. It's your life honey. Just think about it, you can earn $50 (private guitar tutoring) and do uni. So tell me, do you want to be in music or music business or what?  
Me (sad, scared, ashamed) - mum  
Mum - what's wrong?  
Me - I don't think I'm ready for uni...  
Mum (completely changes mood while not even bothering listening to why) - What?? In this family we do not accept laziness! \*turns off tv, tells kids to go to bed and walks off\*  


After that I walked in my room and cried and started cutting as this (in a very long time) is something I deeply want and need.  


Few things I really haven't mentioned

* I go to the gym 4x a week for 2.5 - 3 hours (so I am indeed physically healthy)
* I also go an extra 2x a week for 1 hour with friends
* I have a strong passion for music
* Even though I love music, my 7+ years of guitar playing has not really improved much (which is why I need the gap year)
* There are times in this year where I cried my heart out while walking to shops or coming back from school cause I didn't exact like my life and I felt betrayed by everyone
* I'm not proud of myself
* Most people thinks since I have such caring family, a girlfriend, go to gym, have a passion for music, have a good job (that I actually like), I'm doing well in life. I really am not.
* I don't think I've ever felt true happiness

I'm sorry if this is super long, but I don't know... am I depressed or am I just acting or what? I really don't understand and sorry, I can't go see my doctor till i'm 18 (or else I have to tell my parents which I won't).

Majority of states in U.S. have allowed the use of medical cannabis with some legalizing marijuana use for people aged 21 years and above. With the recent momentous legalization of marijuana in Canada, more other states are considering the decision to legalize bhang for recreational use.

Having noted that, the most pertinent question is: Will the increased legalization of marijuana escalate its abuse among teens? And is it dangerous for teenagers?

Then I got sick. I was institutionalized multiple times. I barely finished college. I had to move home right after. I lived at home for two year,s going between different jobs- never able to hold onto one. I eventually got in trouble with the police and almost had something put on my record, but ‘luckily’ i found some good medications and got better. So the symptoms went away. 

But as I look at my life as what it is now and what it was before I got sick I just wonder if I would’ve been better off just killing myself before it got this serious. The medication caused me to gain 60 pounds. I haven’t dated anyone in 6 years. I am so far behind in my career because I had to spend 3 years of my mid 20’s just barely trying to function. Sure, I got better- great. But compared to the life I had before the way I live now is just no comparison. And what, am I supposed to live the rest of my life like this? I’m pretty sure that if someone had told me before I got sick that I would technically get ‘better’ but my life would end up this way I would’ve just fucking killed myself back then and gotten it over with.

84,"I'm constantly tired. I have zero motivation. It's been like this for months now. I don't go out and do stuff like other 19 year olds do. They have activities and talk to each other.

I watch YouTube videos constantly because it feels better than doing nothing. The only thing I like is food and sleeping. I just feel so pathetic and like something is missing.

88,"Hi. A distant cousin of mine who is my age [19] has been giving off many red flags and I want to know if he is potentially dangerous.

Background: He has psychosis (experiences hallucinations that are mostly audio, but occasionally visual) but has medications for it. This is in tandem with anxiety and other medication he takes. He also had a past with heavy drinking and hard drug usage, in a home that encourages this behavior. He seems very antisocial as well. 

We became pretty good friends for about 2 years, as we lived near each other. We talked as I tried to just be a person he could vent to since he was very alone, and I got to hear many many disturbing thoughts. For a while he talked about a strong desire to chemically castrate himself since no one will have sex with him.

Fast forward to senior year. He was easily the smartest student in the high school, on track for Valedictorian. He suddenly stops striving for it and does no homework for his classes that were not math or math-related. This had never happened before. He also would send sexually suggestive things very occasionally, and one was to me. ""Maybe as a thanks for lending you the pencil, you could give me a bj,"" (2 hours later), ""Omg that wasn't for you I'm sorry, I sent that really late, we are related and that is weird.....unless you're into that? ;)"" 

After this, his spiral got so much worse. Over 20 girls reported his harassment to police (he would send messages much worse than this to nearly all the girls in our year and one year below, including nudes). 

It was a frustrating process, but police couldn't do anything until a minor was involved, and eventually one was (after a girl would respond with ""stop"" he did stop, except for one girl; there is no explanation why police couldn't reprimand him for harassing her despite her pleading with him to stop. She was mentally troubled for weeks and didn't feel safe at school).

Somehow, he was still able to enroll at university, but was kicked out for similar reasons, and was STILL able to go to a different university. All the while, periodically calling or texting or commenting nasty things with some of the same girls, plus new ones. 

I'm afraid he will take out sexual frustration in a violent manner somehow, or even hurt himself in the face of all the rejection. I have no contact with him, but I can find ways to contact people if need be. People are fully aware of this situation but I cannot help but feel that more can be done, since I really do think he might be dangerous to himself or others. ",19Nov2018,1
90,"Hello r/mentalhealth. I wasn't sure where to go with this question but this seems like a reasonable place. I'll try to keep this as concise as possible. 

I am a 30 year old male with a decent job, girlfriend (3 years), friends, apartment. I've been previously diagnosed with depression. Mom is diagnosed as well. Immediate family is quite dysfunctional. I was medicated briefly but haven't been in 5 years or so.   
I guess when I was in high school I realized I didn't have interests like most folks. Couldn't decide what to go to college for. Didn't have many hobbies. Of course everyone always says oh that's perfectly normal at your age. You shouldn't stress about it. You'll figure it out soon enough. Fast forward to today and I feel the same way. I'll try anything. I rarely say no to activities, traveling etc. but I'll never proactively seek out things to do. I have very little passion in my life. I feel like I never did. At age 30 it's become more apparent that I'm walking in place while my peers and close friends are thriving.   
I was recently talking about this with the Mrs and I'm wondering if my problem is more deep-seeded than I ever gave it credit for. I'm sure this isn't uncommon, but curious if any others have been in a similar situation and what they did to get out of the rut. TIA. ",19Nov2018,1
91,"Apologies for the novel and formatting, mobile user here. This is in FL. 
I have a friend who is a woman in her late 50’s. Her daughter (24yo) is “developmentally delayed” diagnosed since childhood. I have met her a few times, she acts/looks more like a 14yo. She had a job at Publix and has had “episodes” in the past, but was mostly functional and living at home. 
Recently she took a turn for the worst. She has become obsessive over men she is meeting on the internet, meeting up with them, disappearing for days on end, and a few months ago moved out of her mother’s house. She has been hospitalized a few times this year and each time they hold her for a few days and the turn her loose again. If her mother comes to pick her up and bring her home, she leaves and the cycle starts over again and she eventually gets a call. As of right now she is in the hospital and is at the end of a baker-act hold (her “bf” left her at the bar and she had a freak-out/episode and her mother was called to come settle the bar tab and take her to the hospital). At this point I am asking if anyone in FL knows of any resources available that would be appropriate treatment for this young lady. Obviously if left to her own devices she gets caught up with manipulative weirdos and could eventually end up in a dangerous situation. Her mother has tried everything possible to help her, often times leading to rebellion/violence. She is being treated as an adult by the system but is clearly not able to function as such. 
The facilities I know of are expensive and I don’t think she has insurance. For anyone who made it this far thank you for reading and for any help or advice you may have. ",19Nov2018,1
92,"I have a brother who doesn’t talk to the family. I’m the little sister by a generation gap. I don’t remember any struggles but he went out to college when I was a toddler. My memories have been happy until recently- where I’ve really done my best to connect with him.

Basically, I am extremely worried about him. He used to be someone who had it together. Or looked like he had it together. Job that paid the bills, dog, home, &amp; wife... ok something weird happened with first wife (but I didn’t totally follow that one &amp; divorce happens.). I know he has blown through all his money- every single penny of it. Sounds like possible homeless. He moved to Colorado, then California, now supposedly he is in Ohio... (well let’s pray Ohio-otherwise, he is right in the Chico area) 

Over the past couple of years since his dog died he has gotten even more extreme with views. Conspiracy theories &amp; everything- just very erratic! 

I have an email address that I can pester him. But if he doesn’t respond then I guess that’s it. If he does respond it is a 1 or 2 word response.

How do I let him know, I care?? Besides pestering him with emails asking how he is doing?? 

Sorry for how long this is... I’m just so overwhelmed!! This has been going on for a very long time!! ",19Nov2018,1

Have to ever heard of a person with OCD have CPS called on them because their house was uninhabitable and filled with random objects to the ceiling, endangering their children and themselves? Have you ever heard of a person with OCD claim that ‘nothing is wrong then them’, thus lacking insight that they have a mental illness? Have you ever seen a person with OCD be feel pleasure when performing compulsions?

* People with severe cases of HD have the CPS called on them.
* People with HD lack insight that something is wrong with them.
* People with HD actually feel pleasure when they perform the compulsive act to gather objects.

I’ve seen countless acts of those with HD be unaccountable for their actions. They obviously have a mental illness but we must always be accountable for our actions. It doesn’t mean we can just negate responsibility if we have a mental illness. I tripped on various objects at one HD sufferer’s house and they told me to “walk slower”. Walking slower doesn’t solve anything if I have to account for random piles everywhere that are tripping hazards.

Another HD sufferer actively complains about having little money, doesn’t seek treatment, then acquires more objects, spending thousands per month on storage fees.

How can you say we’re similar? People with OCD are *safety-seeking* individuals. They worry about situations where potential harm could come to their family members, like the unlikely yet possible stove fire scenario. A person with HD doesn’t actively seek safety for themselves or their family members, evidently the opposite. They don’t worry about a stove fire.",19Nov2018,1

Please excuse my typing, I don’t know how to type what I’ve got to say... Approx 3 months ago I was diagnosed with boarder line personality disorder.

Previous to being diagnosed I was having psychotic episodes, self harm, lashing out at my husband and I’d have the most overwhelming urge to want to die. This started about a year-18 months prior to diagnosis. 
I’ve been put on medication and continue to see the acute mental health team a few days a week.

Some of these include how to manage my emotions and not letting intrusive thoughts control me. (Have had minor depression, but through working out and sleep I’ve controlled it.)
However, since it’s getting darker sooner I can feel my mind and body struggle to adapt and I’m conflicted.
My mind is feeling sluggish, unmotivated, sad, angry, stubborn, no drive, etc. 
However I have so much to do!! 
I have no real reason to feel this way. I’m observing myself being tugged between these emotions which have no basis and watching myself just lay in bed whilst I have so many projects to work on.

I usually manage to do it on monday, the last possibile day, but monday is almost over and I was sick for a great headache, probably caused by both sinusite and the fact I couldn't take  my daily medication for about four days (forgot to order my sertraline). If I had one more day I could probably do my homework, and I feel shame because I couldn't even meet my standard of once per week (the excercise was just a little harder to expand my comfort zone).
I'm worried, I don't want to be considered flaky, and I only have next morning to postpone my appointment, I don't know if this is too late. I know my therapist probably wouldn't care, she's a sweetheart, but I can't shake this feeling.

I’m really tired of it, I’m really angry...really really angry and I’m biting my tongue holding it back but now it’s starting to come out. I’m punching things, I’m snapping at people who irritate me, I’m moody or sad all the time, I hate everyone! 
My mother is an alcoholic and won’t admit it to her self, so everything Wrong in her life is always somehow my fault. She goes trough my things every day, I don’t say a word, I act like I don’t notice. She went into my room, went trough my things and stole a bottle of bailies I got as a Christmas present from my friend. (I don’t keep alcohol in the kitchen because it will be gone by the next day) She drank the whole bottle along with 2 bottles of whine we had in the fridge and put it back like nothing had happened. She came in to my room in the morning and shouted at me for putting the heating on, and now somehow I’m the one apologising to her after she went trough my things...
It’s always like this, she will do something wrong and somehow it will be my fault, or I will have done somthing to annoy her so what she did is forgotten. 
I feel like I can’t breathe, it’s like I’m walking on egg shells everyday, I can’t say certain things I can’t do certain things. It sounds so stupid but I feel like I’m drowning...I’m like a shell Of who I used to be and now I’m just full of thoughts of who I could have been. I shouldn’t be feeling like this, I’m only 20 years old, I’m so sure that this isn’t how it’s supposed to be...is it? 

A few months ago she came back so drunk she couldn’t respond to any of my questions when she came trough the door, just simple questions like “hey, are you okay?” 
She went to the bathroom was on the toilet and passed out and fell off the toilet...I opened the door just to check on her because I was scared she hit her head or something, she woke up and mumbled to me that she was okay. I got her some water and then she started throwing up blood...(or what I thought was blood) I was really starting to panic and then at this point a strange guy walked into the house...I honestly in that moment froze with fear, there was just a lot happening in that moment I didn’t know what to do. I shouted out “mom who’s just come into the house?” After he heard that he ran out the door and I heard him lingering outside so I quickly locked the door and shouted “whoever’s out there can piss off back home” (I think he thought it was just going to be my mother at home so he could...well...I really don’t want to think of what he was going to do but I’m sure you can guess) I was so shaken up that I rang my sister and I rang an ambulance. About 6 hours later I’m waking up on my sisters sofa and I get a text from my mom saying that it’s my fault that she’s there in the hospital. Both me and my sister have had to live like this our whole lives but I think that this is the one that broke me. 
Not long after that I wrote a suicide note, I keep it in my diary. It’s full of the words I wish I could say or wish I would have said.  I’m afraid that when the day comes I won’t get to say goodbye, I know that when that day comes I won’t be in the right headspace to say goodbye to everyone that I love.

104,"Okay, to start things off, I'm a 17 year old male. I moved out of my hometown to get into a better school and have been living with my aunt for a about a year and a half. My mom still works in  my hometown and lives with my younger brother. My dad works in another city, which is about 350 km or 220 miles away from where I'm at. You could say that I'm a bit homesick and miss my family and dog. I wouldn't call it depression but I sometimes have prolonged feelings of extreme sadness, lasting several days and having no motivation to do anything productive. They got better after about a year but have started to happen again as of late.

Over the last week or so, I've been randomly heading very brief voices in my head. Not full blown sentences, just one or two words. They come out of nowhere when I least expect it and they come in voices of people that I know, but something doesn't feel... like the *real* them, I guess. They're not really intrusive in nature, they actually sometimes make no sense at all. I would hear the most random things like ""big clock"" or ""picnic party"" and things like that.

But tonight, things are getting a little weirder. I'm currently writing this at 1:30 AM in bed. At around 10:00 I was looking at my phone when I suddenly heard someone call my name. It wasn't my mom's voice but I don't know, the way it sounded or maybe the way my name was spoken, it was very reminiscent of how my mom calls me. I have a pretty long name and pronounces it in a way which no one does. I heard that voice again but now I could make out what it was saying. The voice was very brief and then I heard a full blown giggle. I got extremely creeped out and switched on all the lights of my room. The lights are still on and I think I'm going to spend the night like this. The voices are still there but not as creepy, just random words. They come in intervals, not continuously.

Today I accidentally screwed over a coworker because I forgot to put some materials back in her lab. She had to cancel a whole class and put her way behind after she went out of her way to let me borrow her stuff. I know I'm responsible, even though granted she didn't have to wait until 5 minutes before her class to ask me, but it's my fault. 

When this stuff happens I go full panic mode. I feel like I can never return to work. I debate quitting or moving or sometimes I just want to die. I can't face my mistakes because I feel so badly. I hyperventilate and freak out and am totally non functional for the entire day.  I get a pain in my chest and feel dizzy. I have blacked out and gone to the hospital before for this but I can't stop it no matter what I try. 

This crap happens anytime I feel like I make a mistake. Friends co-workers family. I burn a lot of bridges that way.

123,"My brother has always had a tendency to have seemingly two sided conversations with himself. For as long as he could talk, really. When we’d ask him about it “who are you talking to?” he’s say “no one.” we’d say “yourself?” and he’d say “no.” and we always thought it was just a kid being a kid. It never stopped, and now he’s 17 and still does this. 

Well this week he admitted to my husband (one of his best friends) that he’s actually been hearing voices. 4 voices with different personalities. They recently told him to hang himself with a belt and he tried it, but didn’t like it and gave up. He won’t say anything more than that. My mom doesn’t know about this. 

Now obviously as his sister who loves him, and considers him one of my best friends, I want to get him help. He wants help too. 

The problem is our parents. 

When I lived with my family I was severely depressed to the point of suicide. I actually ended up hospitalized for it. My dad doesn’t believe in mental illness because he never faced it. He thinks it’s just sadness and you need to “get over it”. My mom gets suuuuper weird about it and victimizes herself. She tells everyone she can about my “rebellious phase” and often focuses on how hard it was on her. 

I’m worried if my brother sees a therapist while living with them they’ll find out (he’s still a minor - we live in Louisiana) and his living conditions will just rapidly decline and overall state of well being will deteriorate. Everyone will find out and he’ll be told it’s not real. It’s a very religious household and they don’t really believe in medicine as much as prayer. 

My husband and I always have our doors open for my siblings, but I also can’t afford to help him get the help he needs, and without my parents insurance neither can he. He has a minimum wage job and is still in high school (homeschooled). 

ALL THIS TO SAY - what do I do? I want to let him make the decision, but I know my input means a lot to him. If the voices are telling him to hurt himself it’s really bad to not get help. But it’s also REALLY bad to have my parents find out.

129,"I don't know if this is ok to post here but I can't reach out for help anywhere right now. If anyone reads this it would be nice to have some advice or something as I feel quite stuck or lost. I don't really know how to describe what I'm feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 18 and live in the UK. When I was about 13 I started seeing CAMHS due to self harming issues and depression. I went for about 4 years with a diagnosis of Depression and Anxiety. I tried different medications and settled on Sertraline. I left the CAMHS team feeling confident that I would be able to support myself mentally from that point on. Things were good and I had a couple of dips here and there but overall, things were ok. I ended up having a great summer (2018) and actually started doing things with my life for the first time in about 5 years. I got a job and applied to university and all that. I left school which was great. Things were going really well.

Cut to the start of university about 2 months ago. Things started declining but I really pushed it to the back of my head telling myself it was normal to have down days. I was working huge amounts of hours in my first few weeks of uni (40+ hours sometimes) and struggled to say no to the work because of fear that I might lose my job. Eventually I managed to ask them to lower it and they did. I thought that would stop the feeling but it didn't. This feeling of losing myself started about this time. I started having periods in whichI felt like I would leave my body and be in complete auto pilot. Like I was standing there and words would be coming out of my mouth and performing actions but it wasn't me. It felt like I was in some sort of dream or just watching myself. It's really hard to explain. My hands and fingers go cold, numb and tingly and I just feel myself going into this state. It's not terrible but it's a strange when I realise that it's happening and I don't know how long I've been doing it for in that moment. Then this depression started. I'll go about my day interacting with people very normally. I don't feel sad or anything, I'd say I feel pretty normal. After I leave suddenly this pang hits my chest and I feel like a weight is on me. Like its harder to breathe and theres a lump in my throat. I think about killing myself graphically. Like going into the bathroom and hanging myself from the shower. Or stabbing myself right in my stomach and twisting the knife slowly round. I don't get any urges to self harm, just these very intense thoughts. They make me cry and feel very intense sadness. I feel like I'm on the verge of a huge breakdown and I don't know what to do. I keep pushing it back and back telling myself I'll get over it but I know I won't I know I'm in denial but I can't face it. Even now typing this I can't stop thinking that I'm fine and being over dramatic. 

Right now, my heads outcome to all this is: drop out of uni, leave job and killself. Which is obviously ridiculous because I know I don't want to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

This is so hard to describe and I'm honestly just here as a cry for help because I don't know what to do right now and I feel like I've hit a point tonight where I'm really suffocating.  


Things I feel I should add:

\&gt;I stopped taking my medication about a year ago.

\&gt;My past with depression and anxiety is much bigger than that, I have huge family issues.

\&gt;I am afraid to reach out to my mum about this. She's not been very good with mental health stuff before and once in a session said ""If she's so hell bent on killing herself why not let her do it?"". She will just get agitated about it and tell me that losing weight will make me feel better which is not what I need right now.

\&gt;I don't have any serious close friends that I can talk to about this. (Another thing that is making me want to drop out of uni right now)

\&gt;The last few times I've gone to the GP about stuff I've had awful doctors who are just patronising and condescending and do nothing to help just make me feel worse.

Overall I feel embarrassed and lost. I don't know what to do. If anyone who wants to can reach out and help or give advice it would be much appreciated. I just don't know what to do right now.

130,"I’m a 16 yr old female and I hear my name in my head over and over again from a strange women’s voice that has a really nasty tone to it and sometimes a man who’s much calmer. They say things such as “behind u” “they’re here” “you’re pathetic” “turn around” on the daily. I also see really tall figures , faces, spiders, and random objects. Not only this but I can feel someone breathing behind me and stroking/touching my arm or back and things crawl on me. This all makes me panic a lot as sometimes I can’t tell what’s real and it affects my everyday life like going out to meet friends for an example, I have to get dropped there or else I feel as if the person behind me is trying to follow or hurt me and I end up breaking down.

134,"Earlier this year, I experienced a traumatic experience in which I was sexually assaulted. Since then, I've been losing a lot of weight very quickly and its starting to make me nervous. It occurred earlier in September, and since then I have lost around 11 pounds. This is concerning because I'm already pretty small (was 122 pounds before, now 111). 

My diet hasn't changed much and I'm eating the same amount and the same thing. I'm not sure if its linked to the trauma or my body is just changing.

135,"I am in my first semester of college and am having trouble balancing my school work with other responsibilities. In high school, I was an extremely high achieving student, having received a 4.5 gpa and a 36 on the ACT. College has been much different for me; I have been struggling a lot and failing a lot of my work. I believe is due to a combination of lack of free time to work on studying and learning and an increase in difficulty of the work I have to do. What worries me the most though is the toll this is taking on me mentally. I am not used to struggling with school work, and I am definitely not used to failing. A large part of my self identity and self esteem was my ability to succeed and school, and now that I am not doing that, I often times feel sad and angry at myself. I feel like I am failing myself and throwing away my potential. Recently, I have been experiencing bursts of anger and extreme stress usually triggered by not understanding what is happening in school. I become irrationally overwhelmed with stress, fear, and anger and feel the need to take it out by screaming and punching stuff. During these bursts, my thoughts race and I really cannot focus on anything except for the negative emotions I'm experiencing. Besides these outbursts though, I generally feel okay and content. I don't know if this behavior is being caused by a mental condition or just being overstressed and came here to ask for advice.",19Nov2018,1

137,"First time i've ever posted anything personal on something like this so apologies if it doesn't make sense or if i'm just rambling on haha.

Over the last 3 years i've been dealing with anxiety and depression and I haven't been able to find a specific trigger to any of it. Last year in September I was at college studying electronic music production, my plan was to do that for a year and then go onto university to get a degree in the same subject. Music has always been a passion of mine and although my producing and mixing skills are very basic, it's still a dream of mine to pursue a career in electronic music. College was going well up until March where things just went downhill, I started 1-2-1 counselling through my college and it was going okay, long story short I overdosed on my antidepressants (sertraline) in June, 2 months after I was on Sertraline 100mg and Propranolol 40mg however I decided to stop without any recommendation from my GP or counsellor, was just curious as I was just not improving at all yano?

Been 1 month since I stopped taking my medication, first 3 weeks it felt like I was ready to take the next step in my life, felt ready to work and to start improving mentally and physically. On the 16/11/18 I hit this brick wall, something that I didn’t experience for a month or so which made me dwell on whether this high of being off of my medication was finally coming to an end. I tried to just ‘ride it out’ but nothing changed to be honest, kinda made it worse ironically. I wanted to start the gym again as i’m in the worst shape i’ve ever been which is taking its toll on my confidence. The night before I was slightly sceptical about whether I was going to actually go or not but I felt determined so I just thought nothing of it. This morning I just couldn’t bring myself round to going, which just started this huge decline throughout the day where I felt like I was sinking. I didn’t get out of bed until 1pm as I was too busy feeling sorry for myself. I’m just at this point where I Don’t know what to do, people say “The world is yours” and “You can do whatever you want to do”, that might be true but I literally have no clue, I want to work to earn money but at the same time I want to travel, I want to progress with my music but where do I even start? it’s been over 5 months since I overdosed and i’m still unemployed, still sat on my arse every single day just wondering what to do yano? I’m in this spiral where I feel like I can’t help myself (which is my own fault and I do take responsibility) so I ask for help and advice from friends &amp; family but I feel like i’m expecting so much from them that it just leaves everyone feeling helpless and frustrated. I want to improve my body but I struggle going to the gym, I want to work towards something in the long term, I want to prove to myself that I’m a good person and that i’m capable of following goals and my dreams.

138,"My psychologist referred me to a psychotherapist practice thingy. My first meeting is in three months. Then they/we/me decide whether I need it or not or if I should go someplace else etc. In the mean time I still have appointments with my psychologist. So far they've helped a little bit, but I don't think it's enough. It's surface level stuff: make a schedule, stick to it, do the things you enjoy, stop being harsh on yourself etc. I know I should do all these things but I'm here cuz I can't. And even if I do, I'm still miserable at the end of the day.  i don't even know what's wrong with me yet do I have anxiety? depression? am I just lazy and self pitying? 

My boyfriend is doing his best to help me. Giving me all his tips on how he is dealing with his depression, forcing me to stay positive. He's really trying, but I can't quite get myself to do what he's telling me to do. I just keep responding with depressing shit.

I am trying but something inside me is telling me to give up and allow myself to destroy my body and mind. How am I supposed to hold out until February?",19Nov2018,1
139,"Psych wards are a complete joke, in America they are basically coed prisons. I think they inflict more trauma than they heal. I VOLUNTARILY went to one once after I experienced cannabis induced psychosis. I have no criminal history or history of needing psych treatment besides this experience. They still wouldn't let me out for a month. I was around psychotic gang members (recognized their tattoos) who would snicker at me and threaten me, a psychotic girl in a cult who snuck into my room and defaced my walls and books with crayons then stole my clothes because I refused to read her cult bible with her. The guy in the room next to me was vomitting constantly and rubbing his shit on the walls, but they wouldn't move me to get away from the smell. A few of the scary gang affiliated guys kept following me around anytime I left my room to get exercise in the halls (I had to pace back forth which probably made me look crazy but I needed to walk) and nobody did anything even though this was all caught on camera and there were times they could have easily attacked me. They would murmur stuff about Santeria and sacrificial killings. Another guy there for something similar to what I was experiencing was my biggest defender from the scariest people, but I had to talk to him a lot and accept his flirtatious comments with a smile for his protection. The rooms were dirty, only mopped once a week with a chemical solution that DEFINITELY can't be healthy to breathe in. The food bland and not very nutritious... sometimes an apple and cream of wheat, or an iceberg lettuce salad with a peanut butter sandwich, kraft mac in cheese with some corn. I thankfully was given some soy milk's each day with vitamins in them. They forced me to be a vegetarian even though I am not a vegetarian. Nobody else was forced to be a vegetarian, I'm not sure why they decided this for me but they wouldn't let me change it. I went from 110 down to 95 lbs because they wouldn't let me have as many snacks between meals as they gave bigger people. Eating around the others was digusting, they would smack their lips, throw food, make huge messes all around themselves. Taking my veg tray to my room and refusing to eat with the others tacked on more time to my sentence. One of the tech's was on a power trip and kept making fun of me whenever nobody else was around. The music/art therapists were complete jokes, even I could have provided a much better service if I was contracted by the hospital, seriously. They had student EMT's and student's from the police academy do walk through's and look at us as if we were zoo animals. I have no idea why but this was so embarrassing, these could have been the people I went to HS with (thankfully they weren't). I talked to a psychiatrist for maybe 10 minutes a week. I was forced to take medicine I didn't want to take to be released. I never received a diagnosis, all I got for closure was a nurse who said I probably had a schizoid personality type. This experience cost my insurance 68k and i lost my apartment because I had no way of paying my rent from inside the ward. There was nobody to talk to about this. A medical social worker would come in once a week and I think she was the one who could have helped me get my bills paid, but she was swamped with more pressing issues wasn't able to make time for me. It was a nightmare. I obviously won't be touching cannabis ever again. One of the creepiest things I experienced there was a girl with a shaved head who would spin in circles, speaking in what sounded like pentecostals speaking in tongues. When she would use English she would stare right at me and start chanting ""I'm a 10. I'm a 10. I'm a 10."" I don't know what she meant by it but it was really awkward for me. She made me so anxious. One day three sweet girls studying nursing at USD came to... intern? They looked so horrified. I could tell they felt extra bad for me because I was so out of place among the others. The place was hell. I honestly can't believe places like that can exist and can charge insurance for medical care. I am pretty sure I was more sane than ALL of the tech's, and some of the nurses too. I console myself by telling myself this is just another experience I can draw from if I ever decide to write a novel.",19Nov2018,1

Power Sentences  
GRAB attention with one sentence! They Help you GET a promotion, ATTRACT a girlfriend and ASSIST you in effective delegation. BE eloquent to boost self-esteem and confidence. BE persuasive, NOT MANIPULATIVE, to help you get what you want (without stepping over others). INCREASE the impact of each Phrase you use with Power Sentences!  


A simple recipe is: Action Verb + Numbers = Power Sentences.  
START with Energy in Motion/An Action Verb! = (Lift, Be, Join, Resist, Avoid, Run, Breathe, Focus, Listen, Use etc...To Name A Couple)   
And then Quantify -&gt; ADD Numbers!  
USING impressive numbers makes your sentences more Memorable. (Lift 290lbs/Be 100% present/Join the Million Members/RESIST the pull of gravity by ROCKETING at 25,000 miles per hour to ACHIEVE escape velocity/Avoid the 4% of Psychopaths in Society/Run a 4 minute Mile/Breathe to the count of 10/Focus during the entire 45 minute session/Listen to my 2400 Watt subwoofers/Use 50% of your energy/Tithe 10% of your income/Budget to save $1,000 each 30 days)  
Use the synonyms of ""very,"" to be Extremely, Elephantine-ly, Colossally more Romantic than you would be by just using the word ""very.""  
Also sprinkle Vivid and Colorful Adjectives into your sentences. Create Mental Images, the more unusual or emotionally charged, the better for recall and recognition!  


Your power sentences must be based in reality so ensure your claims are credible and factual (Avoid Propaganda, Hyperbole and Fake News)!   
Avoid starting sentences with the word ""Don't"" when trying to inspire action. All the audience hears is what comes after the ""Don't."" = Reverse Psychology!  
Discourage actions by using the Verbs, ""Resist"" or ""Avoid.""  
Ask questions by starting the sentence using the Verbs ""I Wonder"" or ""I'm Curious.""   
A Convincing Power Sentence, in order to persuade, must have evidence behind why you deserve whatever it is you're pursuing. After your plea use the word ""because"" and give your pitch. ""I Deserve.... Because... Please..."" makes a world of difference in collaborations and getting a desired action from others by giving your audience a reason to do so.   
ASK for what you want and BE Polite. Please. Thank You. You're Welcome. Go a long way.   
Everyone wants to be a part of a group. Strength in numbers. We human's are a social animal to an extreme level. We have a super complex frontal lobe configuration and cerebral cortex that helps use control nature through science and communicate with our peers in a very nuanced way. Tell people, to build your Network Base and Community, to: (Join here...) /(You're Invited...) /(Become a Member...)! Make Friends and Build Bridges!  
When you want to play Devil's Advocate, start off with, ""That's interesting...Why do you..."" And continue to poke holes (and strengthen) their theory.  
Eliminate unnecessary words.   
A Magic Phrase that works Wonders = ""It means a lot to me to work with you.""
