0,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can.

I'm currently 20 years old. When I was 15 I started to get into these moods that I have come to describe as waves of emotions. I know that sounds super edgy and whatever but since I don't have a better name it's what I use. 

I'll give you a common scenario. My day starts off fine. I wake up feeling good and happy and positive about the day ahead. Towards the evening, I'll be sitting at home just minding my business. Out of nowhere, I'll get really annoyed and if anyone is around me I'll get really annoyed at them to the point that I can't be in the same room or even talk to them because their presence annoys me. This lasts for about an hour, which afterwards I get sad. I feel hollow-almost numb, and like an imaginary grey cloud is floating above my head. This sad/hollow feeling will last for the rest of the night, sometimes it's so strong I find myself crying or breaking down over no apparent thing. When I wake up the next morning, I feel exhausted but otherwise fine.

This usually happens to me a couple times a month. I do get seasonal depression in the winter but this feeling is consistent year round and there doesn't seem to be anything that causes its onset.

I wonder if anyone else has ever experienced things like this? If you have I would really appreciate some help!",09Nov2018,1
1,Tomorrow is my first psychology appointment. I have horrible anxiety and typically when I try to talk to my parents they don’t understand me or how I’m feeling. I KNOW that a therapist is there to hear you but I’m so used to feeling misunderstood that I am terrified of going. ,09Nov2018,1
2,"Preface: I do not have any form of medical insurance, and am fully aware that asking online is not a substitute for professional help. I will be enrolling at the beginning of the year however, and will seek care immediately after.

I've been dealing with a serious lack of motivation, both personally and in my professional life (I'm in a management role at a restaurant) and cannot for the life of me keep myself productive and on track.

At home, I'm either laying down scrolling through my phone endlessly or playing a game/watching Netflix. I am aware that routine things should be done at home such as cleaning, laundry, bathing etc but it's a task in and of itself to craw off the bed/couch and be active enough to take on these tasks

At work, I accepted a promotion thinking it would reignite some kind of spark I used to have, but lately it's been the same 9-12 hour struggle to get through the day. I just wander aimlessly through the store and getting the bare minimum done. All I really want to do in either situation is smoke or sit down.

I hate feeling like a waste, and want to change so bad but its almost like I'm unable to. I have days where I'm more engaged and productive but they're getting scarce. I also don't want to label myself as depressed since I don't have negative thoughts outside of ""eh I'll get to it another time"" so there's no real sadness outside of the disdain i have for my own lack of motivation. No suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self harm. 

Tldr; I feel like a waste 99% of the time, want to change but it feels like a lost cause",09Nov2018,1

6,"I own a small business. Business is slow, work is piling up (working on summer marketing etc) and I'm so horrified of my to do list because it's so long.

I haven't checked my email in 3 days because I haven't been in a position to ""tackle"" them and I'm so scared to open them and see what I've been late on or missed or have to catch up on and see my shame and failure of anxiety staring me in the face.

The first year of business I was fine. A workaholic actually. Then this past spring just dove off the deep end, not caring about the business much, loving home life, yard work every day, happy as could be, business suffering and work piling up in return.

I still have not caught up from this. My close friend has gotten me adderall a few times so I could accomplish some large chunks but otherwise when I think about the work I need to do I panic and avoid it, telling myself ""this this what I'm gonna do tomorrow! Yeah! I'm so pumped!"" then that time comes, panic, avoid, repeat.

My SO is out for work a lot and I get very lonely and reclusive when he's gone too long.  I know i shouldn't base any of my life on his availability but my depression is rough af right now.

How do I work on fixing this? Therapy is out of the question, I can't afford it. I'm on effexor currently, switched from Lexapro 2 months ago or so.

This roommate doesnt usually have problems with reading peoples emotions or any social issues but with me she says she just cant ever tell. She said she cant tell if im okay or pissed off or upset ever unless I blantantly tell her Im upset or anxious about something. And I kinda feel like almost everyone else is this way towards me and it makes alot of sense to me. I've always been labeled thorughout school as someone who just doesnt give a fuck about anything by everyone from other students to the principals but thats the complete opposite of who I am. I care alot about school but I've never been able to do well in school until now, after learning I have add. Its just really confusing because the more I think about I'm very conflicted about it. I have alot of trouble telling my emotions to people, espically therapists, I dont know why but it makes me severally uncomfortable to the point where I've had panic attacks in past relationships because my partners would always end up fustrated when I refused to tell them certain thing about my emotions. At the same time I dont really feel in control of my emotions, there always changing and sometimes I feel like I just dont feel anything at all. Lately I had kinda noticed it because I've been pretty stressed lately and for the last year or so I havent found any of the things I used to find enjoyable still fun or anything. Im a CS major and I used to love pc gaming and found just general computer stuff very fun and now I dont feel any type of enjoyment out of it. I only really still do computer stuff that comes from my classes. 

Its just weird, throughout highschool I somehow developed a really monotone voice that kinda changes sometimes but usually its very monotone. I blankly stare at things alot and have a generally blank expression I've been told from my roommate. I just feel generally uncomfortable almost all the time except when I'm at home, work or alone.

9,"Background: I have major depression, recurrent, moderate and anxiety not otherwise specified. I recently completed a round of ECT in August, take medication, and go to therapy.

I feel like I'm pretty good at using my coping skills for anxiety. But when it comes to depression, all is lost. My mood has boosted with ECT and recent med changes, but I'm still depressed. My main symptoms are a lack of interest in doing anything, a lack of motivation, loss of pleasure and boredom. I'm not a crier. I used to be, but I think I've cried so much in my life there's just no tears left.

When something upsetting happens (like the all out war we are having with my stepsons' mom right now) I get really low and can't cope. I do what I absolutely HAVE to do, like take the kids to school and pick them up, feed them, make sure they are taken care of and safe, but other than that if I have the opportunity to lie in bed while they're in school, that's where I am.

Do you have any depression coping skills you can recommend? I will be talking to my therapist about this on Wednesday, just curious if you guys have any suggestions before then. Thanks.",09Nov2018,1
10,"What mostly reasons stuttering is when you have so many words you want to say, that all your words get caught up in your throat. 

Music, especially spontaneous singing is always relaxing structured and goes with a rhythm and a flow which is pleasurable and has beneficial effect on the mind and relieves stress. Stress on the other hand aggravates stuttering. From the point of view of Neurology and Neuroscience. 
The stressful situations either natural in day to day life or designed for certain tests unmask the hidden subliminal brain electrical abnormalities such as seizure disorder.

This is easy. the centers of the brain you use for different functions singing isn't located in the same center of the brain as speech. or something like that. anyway when you sing you use other centers of the brain and that normally doesn't have the defect that causes stuttering. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsKf4WCGvUc",09Nov2018,1

So lately I've started realizing that I have huge urge to be used. I started new relationship and my new GF has her people to do 'special tasks' for her and I feel so uncomfortable with that.

16,"Hello! Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I think I should get this out of the way first. In reality I think I am like, a bit shy and well mannered, and I don't like violence or hurting other people. So I wouldn't ever let my desire to burn hurt anyone, or their property. I don't represent any sociopathic traits, and I am rather stable emotionally. 

Long story short I like to burn things. I like to feel the fire and I take whatever opportunity I have to burn stuff. Since I was little I took some papers or a pile of woods and just spent my afternoons watching it burn. This has always been kept a secret to my family and here's the reason why. I am a student for commercial pilot and you may have heard that the psychological exams, both for becoming a student pilot and getting a job, are tough ones, which is completely understandable and I'm glad it's that way.

Basically they try to keep the number of pilots with mental issues in their records to a minimum.

I had a bad bad episode of my life last year after a tough break up and dropping out from university among other things. And as bad as I wanted to let it all out and hug my parents and speak with them, I feared that they (as the lovely parents they are) would try to help me by getting professional help. Which meant, that getting into my records and... well you see the problem.

Now I am much more stable, I moved out and I am pretty happy with my life. I thought that once I was done with being sad I wouldn't feel like burning things, like oh, it's just a coping mechanism. But recently it has been hitting me again. \_I think of something I think of it burning, even people which scares me. Once again I would never risk putting someone else in danger, but I still get some thoughts. As much as I love how it feels, I don't think it is right and I am very scared of it developing into something else. I'm reaching out for you lads reading this in case you have any suggestion that can help me. 

Thanks once again! Have a great night.

18,"A bit of backstory first. I had a major traumatic event happen and because I had no insurance I wound up at the ER. I was desperate to talk to someone sooner than the available outpatient appt of 8 weeks out(which is super far out). The nurse said that if I said I was suicidal I could get help right away. I thought I would get to see a counselor, talk about whats bothering me and go home. In hindsight I should have said nothing but I was an 18 yr old girl living alone in a city where I knew no one so I was a total idiot. So I said yea I am suicidal. Next thing I know I was admitted involuntary which i did not expect to happen or even understand what that really meant. They gave me a bunch of meds and I just took them without asking because I was tired and figured they would only hold me one night. I later found out they put me on the highest possible dose of gabapentin and seroquel and it was some antidepressant- remeron i think? Anyways I was drugged the fuck out but I was hoping to explain to the doctor that I wasn’t really suicidal, and I just thought I would get quicker help if I said it. The psychiatrist met with me the next day and said I was bipolar; which confused me because they never asked me anything, not even any from a sheet or anything.  Let me be clear, I have never had a manic state or anything of the sort so I denied I had it but he said that denial was one of the biggest symptoms of bipolar. Whatevs, I didn’t argue because once again dumb 18 year old. The next few nights is where it got unbearable. The night nurse tech would come into my room (I guessed around 1ish), I didn’t have a roomate. He would proceed to grab my breasts and touch me inappropriately and he told me if I said anything then It would just make me look more crazy and I would be in there longer. So I said nothing. This year is the first time I have been able to talk about this. I never followed up with any mental health professional at all because I am terrified of them. I know I do not have bipolar disorder and would like an accurate diagnosis. I believe I have CPTSD, as I fit most of the criteria. My stepdad would lock me in closets until 5 minutes before my mom got home and other things of that nature so it would make sense. Now I have trauma issues with psych wards and all other things mental health wise. Its gotten better but honestly the nightmares are unbearable. I have them every night and I just need them to stop. I want to try going to a psychologist but I am completely unopen to taking any medication. Will they just throw me aside because A) I have serious trust issues with mental health professionals and B) because I dont want to be medicated. Any advice on how to regain trust? Any advice on anything else?Sorry for the long read. ",09Nov2018,1

20,"First time posting here.

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background on myself; I'm 20 years old, and currently attending university. I haven't exactly been diagnosed with any mental health problems in the past, and have not spoken to many professionals about my issues, perhaps out of a fear of being labeled.

From the age of about 11 I suffered from moderate depression-like symptoms, and it wasn't until about a year ago that I sought any sort of help. A friend gave me the number of a psychiatrist he knew, who I kept in contact with for about half a year. During that time he tested me to see whether or not I have depression, and I scored about 2 points below an official diagnosis. He then worked with me on different tactics at combating my shifts in mood without taking medication (which ended up not working too well, as how I felt during a certain time was completely unpredictable). 

He recommended that I make a record of my shifts in mood and try to see if there were any patterns. What I found was pretty interesting.

About 50% of the time I would report feeling what I would define to be ""depressed"".

10% of the time I felt like I was in somewhat of a manic state where I felt stupidly bold and confident.

The other 40% was a complete lack of feeling, where I was completely neutral to any stimuli which I was presented with. (Not feeling happy over things that should have made me so, not having any reaction to extremely sad things, etc.)

While the amount of time I felt depressed startled me, the times when I felt nothing fascinated me the most. For instance, my father recently had a major stroke and was put into a seriously life threatening situation. He's battled with several forms of health issues due to alcoholism, and due to (mostly) unrelated reasons my family has been falling apart in the past several years. This on top of the other stresses of life should be enough to provoke some emotional response in a normal human being, but upon hearing about these things I feel little to no empathy. 

As a matter of fact, during high school I felt constantly depressed about these and other personal issues which stressed me to the point of crying nearly every day. I feel like as I've grown older (especially in the last year) I've moved away from depression and closer to simply not feeling anything. It hurts to smile and I can't find humor in anything, but I can't even feel sad or stressed or nervous about anything either. It almost feels like I've lost the thing which makes me human.

Any ideas about what this is and how I can improve it? I know there exists a point where I can feel normal emotions and control them, but I just don't know how to achieve that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how useful this will be, but just in case here is some other misc. background information that might help:

\- I eat a fairly typical eastern diet (rice and vegetable heavy), and try to avoid sugar to an extent.

\- I am very conscious of personal grooming

\- I masturbate about once per day (however have made futile efforts to stop after hearing this could be affecting my hormone balances)

\- I have somewhat of an addictive personality and spend a lot of time on electronics and social media

\- I do not smoke or drink.

\- I am somewhat of an introvert and don't enjoy interactions with others very much

\- I believe myself to be a nice person, and dislike the thought of causing displeasure to another

\- I sleep an average of \~7-7.5 hours per night.

\- I am currently not on any form of medication.

21,"If you are ever feeling down about your place in the world it is vital that you stop comparing yourself to other people (easier said than done I know).

I share my thoughts on this here (4 min read) - https://medium.com/@zacpphillips/https-medium-com-zacpphillips-why-you-are-your-own-worst-critic-9f895f2bc67a

TLDR:

You see all of your flaws, inner thoughts and are privy to every insecurity, yet you only see what other people choose to share with you.

This factor is highlighted with social media. Everything you see online is curated, edited, tweaked and filtered to project something. Every image, post and link has been chosen for a reason (yes even this one).

Thus if you are looking at the successes of others, their amazing lives, hot bodies, or amazing life events, and its causing you duress - turn it off.

22,"Well, now, I have a lotttt of issues but this particular one is just disruptive for everyday life, since I’m studying and working at the same time.

Now, since young, whenever I’m really really stressed I’ll always get a brain fog. Not too bad, I can develop some coping skills on my own. I also have ADHD (diagnosed only like 4 years ago) and Concerta helps my brain get on track. Mostly. 

Since 2 years ago though, the slight brain fog strengthened and no medication can clear it. Stillll somewhat manageable, I can still plough through my textbooks and work life (with huge huge effort). But I had to take breaks every 15min or so and stare blankly at anything because the brain fog makes it really tiring to think.

However, a few months ago, family, school and work problems clashed together in ONE night and ever since that night of extreme distress, my brain fog sessions evolved to being a lot more worse and appears almost everytime I’m stressed, even slightly. 

Right now, if I pass my very low stress management threshold, I start feeling disconnected. My body feels heavy, like 2nd skin. Or a suit. I dunno. If I’m not concentrating, I’ll automatically shut off (i’e, freeze on the spot), my vision blurs (seeing with clarity felt like a huge effort) and my mind is transported to an inner world, a flat expanse of a green field with a blue blue sky. I stay in there for like 15min until I come to my senses. And realized that I looked stupid and hoping nobody saw me frozen like that.

He was the most emotionally attatched to me, I always used to share my feelings with him, and there were also some secrets that he shared only with me. When ever I used to feel sad or anything, he was always there and he supported me. He was the most down to earth and loving person. He could never see anyone in pain, and everyone around him has always admired him. I didnt know that he is going to pass away until it were his approximate last two weeks, that was because my mom always likes to hide things from me from the beginning.
From my childhood, my mom has always been abusing me either mentally or physically. When my dad passed away, we recently migrated to Canada. Here I have no one to talk to, neither I have any friends. Since my dad passed away, I havent laughed properly or had a single day without pain. And now my mom doesnt have any proper conversations with me, all she talks about is either helping her work at home, or she yells at me at the smallest things which make me feel shocked and completely broken, she has been doing it since my childhood, but then I had my dad protecting me and he made me feel happy. My mom doesnt even have a single picture of him on the wall. 
The yelling happens every single day when she usually grabs me from my neck and just says stuf even today I tried to argue back and then she yelled like shes crazy,t then she throws the mug she had in her hand on the ground as hard as she can and just runs to her room and bangs her door. She also usually hits me after a few days. She always had anger issues, and I am the one suffering because of them.

I've signed up for counselling but it'll be months before they find a new psychiatrist after the last one died of cancer two weeks ago.  Really I have no future, I can't focus and my physical health has been deteriorating from the stress and depression I feel on a daily basis.  I can no longer take joy, even if I try and force myself, in little things anymore.  I don't like being around my wife or son, it's not their fault and I feel guilty for pushing them away and I try to be affectionate when I can but I feel so distant and mentally and emotionally dead.  I thought about ending it for some time now, but partially I've lost so much motivation I can't even be motivated to kill myself.  How f'in disgusting.

31,"I am from Florida and in treatment for depression and substance abuse. This is also a throwaway account.

So long time lurker on my main account, I just had one of the most intense sessions today. I look back and realized I was only a couple statements away from being Baker Acted. I was dealing my aunt possibly being suicidal via text msg and it pushed my mind going way to fast that I started having an anxiety attack as I was sitting in the waiting room. I'm also a student that's been sober for a little over a week and my depression is starting to come out and show it's ugly face. As the session got started I admitted to being increadibly sad and not feeling motivated  to do anything about my depression. After he started asking more questions, out of frustration, stated I wanted to burn myself (my method of self harm) in order to feel relief from all the mental anguish I was under at that moment. 

Now my therapist has grounds to have me send to a behavioral health facility in order to get a full pysch evaluation, and he knows my feelings about being involuntarily examined. He used a breathing technique to see if I can deescalate myself at the moment and here I am posting this to Reddit.

I really wanted to share this story because there are therapists out there that really want you to walk out of their office as a person and not escorted by the cops. ",09Nov2018,1

35,"I personally went through a rough break up, relapsed on alcohol, attempted suicide, kept drinking till I started blacking out and didn't realize I had, I'm lucky to be a live and free right now.. I'm in AA and talking with a psychologist and am getting better each day.

But the day I started to feel really good again, about a month ago. My sister's husband tried to kill her in front of her kids, he's been in therapy, she is forgiving him and letting him back into her life.
Today she read a riot? (Not totally sure what that is) to my dad when he went to give her some money, about all the physical/verbal abuse he inflicted on her, my mother, my brother and I.

In the last few months ive lost just about everything that matters to me, the love of my life, the respect of my friends, the confidence my family saw in me. luckily I still have my job. Work one of the few things that keeps my mind of my fuck ups.

I don't know what to do, as Soon as things look up, a shit storm breaks out. My head is being pulled In a dozen directions most of the time lately but now just learning how upset my sister is and won't talk to me about stuff anymore. It's odd, I'm not even thinking about my problems now. I need to man up get over myself and be tough for my dad, he was a piece of shit in the past but he's the best version of himself today and doesn't need to be reminded of awful mistakes thirty years ago. Looking at him today tells me people can change, it's the only example I have right now to think I'll be the best version of myself one day. My life went from the greatest it's ever been to worst, attempting suicide seems to have affected so much more than I ever thought it would. I just needed to vent this as I don't have anyone I can be this vulnerable with right now.

Just attempting suicide changed everything, not just me. The ramifications it's brought are now more eye opening than ever as I type this I feel my Inner strength coming back. Thank you.",09Nov2018,1

43,"I'm a university student and have been experiencing a large amount of stress for the past few weeks. Stressors have ranged anywhere from a friend of mine threatening to committing suicide, to the possibility that my grandmother is dying, to my entire family being in some way involved in a criminal investigation against my father. This is exacerbated by my diagnosed ADHD and my longstanding (undiagnosed) depression and anxiety, as well as my and my family's complete lack of money as I try to loan my way through college. I would have hoped that at a major university that's been in the news for consistently failing to meet student's mental health needs, teachers might see the positives in responding to students who approach them with understanding, and might try to work with them. I would also hope that after failing multiple classes last semester, and having the teachers of those classes tell me that I needed to approach them if I was having life difficulties, that they might be willing to work with me on making up missed assignments, or taking it a little bit easier on me. My requests are never out of proportion: last time I asked for something it was when I submitted a paper at 2am when it was due at midnight; not a huge difference, and something that has been totally acceptable in most classes I've taken. My grade had 50% taken off of it due to the late-night two hours, and the TA told me she couldn't/wasn't willing to do anything about it. The time before that was when I spent the night before another paper was due trying to check in on a friend in my hometown and make sure he wasn't going to kill himself; the paper was due at noon and i approached the teacher asking for an extension til the end of the day, and i laid out an entire plan for her of how i could make this up, and offered to show her evidence of my friend's suicide threats. She refused to extend the paper, told me that part of the refusal was due to the fact that i'd been showing up for class 10 min late lately, and then ended up taking 30% off of my grade. It was only after I broke down crying in class from the sheer stress of being told to basically fuck off because I was trying to keep someone from killing themselves, and then getting official documentation from the school's medical center, that she said she would take my circumstances into consideration. 

Even side from asking for accommodations, I approached a teacher just to let her know what was going on. I have about a C in that class, and I thought I might be able to talk to her for suggestions on how to keep up in the class and what I could do to not fail. Her response was that, and I quote, ""you don't have a wife and kids yet so you don't really know what stress is. Everyone has problems but they somehow manage them, and you have to manage yours too. If you work on yourself and making yourself more focused on your school work, then you'll do better."" 

I don't think I ask for too much. Maybe I do, but if I were in their place and a student came to me with the list of problems that I have, I would be incredibly willing to work with them. And I've had teachers who enthusiastically wanted to help me succeed in their classes despite the massive amount of anxiety and ADHD that I experience. But those have been the exceptions to the rule. I'm just at this point at a loss for what to do. If I approach my teachers I'm blown off, if I don't I'm scolded for not approaching them sooner. It's like I'm stuck in this insane catch 22 of mental health issues and real life problems that nobody seems to be able to comprehend that a college student like me might have. As long as I'm not failing their classes, who cares what's going on in my life. And if I am failing in their classes, then it's automatically completely my fault. A friend of mine with similar issues said that looking back at the years hes spent in school so far, even in semesters where he got all A's and excelled, he never felt like it had been a good quarter and always was extremely thankful it was over with. Too many of my friends here drink alcohol excessively and smoke weed to be able to deal with the stress of this fucking system, too many abuse adderall and other adhd meds, and even if I disagree with that i can't even blame them. I'm watching someone I know really well go from an extremely happy person who loved life, to someone who suffers from so much anxiety from her schoolwork that she's taken up the habit of picking at her skin, creating noticable scars and scabs on her face. Someone who says that for the past couple of months they've been feeling completely numb inside. All of these kids just somehow slide by the eyes of admins and teachers and it's insane that this happens, and nothing's being done. The past 2 decades have seen 29 suicides here, a recent report from UC berkeley found that there, 3500 students seriously considering ending their lives every year and very few of them are able to take advantage of the resources that the university apparently so openly provides to them. It takes 3 weeks at my college to get a couseling appointment and all of the psychologists in the area have week and month long waitlists for new patients, it took a friend of mine 3 months to find one who would accept him as a new patient. It's just completely insane how we've designed a system that's literally killing people, and harming the ones it doesn't, in the name of educating them. School shouldn't be easy, but it shouldn't be this hard.",09Nov2018,1

I have realized something that separates me and I think is playing into my depression and my lack of motivation. I think of emotion as a scale and on the better side is euphoria and happiness love and youre other classic positive emotions and on the other you have bad awful then a little further depressed the emotion, depressed the disease pretty close to each other but slightly separate and then at the very bottom of the scale is numb. I think that's the worst thing that you can feel in my own experience. I have lived a little over 4 years now in somewhere between clinical depression and numb.

50,"My GF was assaulted as a young high school student.  She says the family over-reacted (not punishing/shaming her, but had trouble dealing with it anyway) and forced her to see doctors/therapists, leaving her with unpleasant feelings associated.  
She says she found peace for years with her ex-husband, but he drank, and began to get violent in that last year of their marriage, so she left him.

I'm her first relationship post-divorce.  Dating for a year and a half now, things were awesome, and she opened up to me about her past, and I had been gently encouraging her to seek treatment.

However, she began to get more labile, reacting STRONGLY to small slights, both real and perceived.  I am often aloof, and while I'm working on it, I forgot her first birthday.  Additionally, she's extremely suspicious of my friendships with other girls, to the point where I'm wholesale breaking off contact with most girls (to be fair, I don't mind.  She had mentioned that I kept female friends for validation more than anything, which seemed correct, so I felt it was fine).

She attempted suicide a few months ago, and I got her to finally see a psychiatrist.  Since then it's been up and down.  Right now, she's not talking to me because I had some girls like a FB post, to which I told her that ""It's not like I'm going out to coffee with them."" which, of course she knew I had hung out with some in college.  This escalated into her asking the last time I spoke to some of them.  I honestly thought it had been longer than it actually had, so my answer of ""years"" turned out to be like 6 months (I feel idiotic for not just checking first.

52,"My life is just in such a weirdly normal position right now. I mean, I'm a freshman in high school, I get A's and B's, in all the honors classes, have friends (I'll get to that part later), and everybody's so fucking nice to me I don't even know what's wrong with me anymore.

I guess I should start off with my main concern at the moment which is my home life; I live in an apartment with just my mom and cats. My house is a mess, my mom is having mental issues, and I just can't take any of it anymore. My house is such a mess because my mom refuses to clean up after herself. This summer I took a month-long trip to California, my room being completely clean when I left but now it's such a fucking mess. She just decided to move all of her stuff into my room without any of my consent. Now I don't even have the will to clean it up because of how mad I am at her. She complains to me about all of her problems even though I don't give a damn about any of them because I've heard this same speech over and over again. Sometimes I think she's the worst human being alive and then the next day I thinl of how much she ""sacrifices"" for me and it's so confusing.

Now I'm also having violent Impulses that are getting harder and harder for me to control. Just the other night I got somewhat annoyed because my tablet was being glitchy that I just spontaneously smashed it five times against my headboard. I waited a second in pure shock and then threw it again at the opposite wall and right after I threw a glass. I told my mom and she said it was okay but I'm still really worried and sad because that was the only way that I could talk to my friends which helped me get through all of my useless time alone. The night right after she asked if she could borrow something from me and I was reluctant because I wanted to use it and the she started stressing out so I kind of tossed it towards her. She then started crying because I was visibly getting annoyed at her. I had a plate right next to me and I almost threw it right at her but I told her to ""just fucking leave."" I took a moment and then went to go put the plate away but then I randomly threw it out onto the ground and the shards are still there because neither of us has wants to clean it up. It's like I can't even control my actions at this point anymore. They just happen and there's no filter between what I want to do and what I actually do.

And now to my friend group. I started school late because of bureaucratic nonsense. I somehow managed o make friends although I'm pretty sure they all think I'm the weird one at this point. I'm not socially awkward but sometimes I make jokes that might make people think I'm inappropriate or something. So now I think that all my friends hate me and that's just great.

Oh yeah, and there's also this guy that I like so much I can't even take it. He's in our friend group and he's so cute I can't even take it anymore. I told him I liked him and he said he's too sexually confused right now to be dating anyone (I'm gay, he's bi). But then he starts flirting with this other girl in our friend group and I'm like wtf and all they do on our group chat anymore if flirt with each other in front of everyone else. Nobody else seems to care but inside it's killing me and he said he was sorry for flirting with her so much in front of me but then he just goes out and does it AGAIN and he still is and I can't even help but look at all of the cute pictures he sends her on the group chat. I know he's a good person but I just get so frustrated and depressed at how lonely I am without him I just can't take it anymore.

So now I want to stab my mom in the throat repeatedly, am having compulsions to cut my own finger off, think all of my friends hate me, and have a major crush on a guy who I know will never love me back. So here I am, sitting on the couch at fucking midnight when I need to get up in six hours but I can't go to sleep because I need to get this all off my chest with glass shards on the floor next to me. And I can't even get into therapy because the healthcare system is fucking messed up and I thin I might just cut my finger off right now. So I'm just talking to you Reddit for help. To all of those of you who listened to me ramble on about my perfect life, thank you. I probably won't be able to respond to comments until this afternoon.",09Nov2018,1

Recently I’ve been having bad anxiety and heard about the shooting in California and told her I don’t want to go because I am nervous but would like to visit them. 

I explained to her the reason why I didn’t want to go. I told her I would go but I’m still nervous about shootings and violence since the concert is in a bad part of town. I told her I’m sorry but my anxiety had been bad lately. I then told her I WOULD go but that I was nervous and I’m sorry for my anxiety getting to me lately. I just am afraid of big events. Plus I went to the concert venue recently and I saw ten cars with windows smashed. 
I told her I would rather hang with her and the family but then told her I would agree to go to the concert. She has ignored my five messages and five calls to try and discuss this situation. 

Her messages to me: 

What do you mean? Are you not going to the concert? Vanessa is planning on you going with her!

You told us you would and I bought you a ticket 

We want to see you too but you said you wanted to go and you knew I got you the ticket. You wanted me to!

Joseph is planning on it too


Now she is ignoring all my messages in response to these. What do I do? 

Also, now that I expressed my anxiety and agreed to go. If she does decide to text me back and invite me she is going to make fun of me the whole time and bring it up randomly years later. She and my family on that side will find things I’ve expressed irrational anxiety about and make fun of me for thinking a certain way. 

**TLDR: told my stepmom I would rather see her and my dad instead of go to a concert. I told her it’s because I am so nervous about shootings and violence especially since the concert is not in a good part of town and last time I went to a concert there cars were broken into. I’m also nervous because of the recent shootings. She told me everyone wanted me to go and that I said months ago I wanted to go. I told her I would go but that I am nervous.

63,"At first when I went to my psychologist I said I hate the DSM and all it does is stereotype people. But now after learning about the difference between mood disorders and personality disorders, and 6 months of therapy, I desperately want a diagnosis other than fucking depression and adhd. I have a family history of BPD which makes me more likely to have it. 


I literally have very little friendships, and no romantic relationships. I'm skeptical of EVERYONE. Impulsive sexual behavior/spending, substance abuse, and being very numb most the time. I tend to give off a don't fuck with me vibe, always think people dislike me/ don't have my best interest in mind (including psychologists/psychiatrists), and tent to give off a look/glare to people. But I rarely get ""angry"". And I don't self harm, although I have had suicidal thoughts I don't think I would ever act on though.

I'm tired of going to therapy every time and feeling like I'm crazy, having my psychologist tell me ""well there's so many disorders that you could match symptoms of a diagnosis doesn't matter I just want to help you"". Bullshit. I feel like I'm more and more crazy every time I go in. My psychologist literally fucking told me I have emotional dysregulation when I requested to go to another therapist, he literally insisted I go to another clinic for DBT specifically. When I asked if I have BPD he says he hasn't diagnosed me with that. Fucking seriously? How the fuck do i get an actual diagnosis that isn't bullshit? ",09Nov2018,1

65,"Hi. There's this thing that's been going on for awhile, and I tell myself again and again ""it's nothing,"" but I think I might have a problem with dissociation. I'm a 25 year old female. Diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type when I was in college and have chronic depression that's been since I was 18 at least. Currently, feeling like 6-8 (6 on a good day, 8 on a bad day). I graduated from a good university two years with a good STEM degree, but I've had trouble since then deciding what I want for myself and finding a job. It's a major source of stress, but I am safe and living at home with my parents so I'm aware that I am fortunate. Things are not the worst, but I have isolated myself to a great extent and am struggling.

Sometimes I feel like what's going on around me isn't really. I think back on my memories and I don't really have any emotions towards them. They feel like things that just happened, but at the same time it doesn't feel real. I feel like I'm on auto-pilot in my life, and I can't change the course of it - I just have to do things and then things just have to happen. I can't imagine a future for myself, but I think that stems from the general lack of direction mentioned above. I look around the world and the shootings happening almost every week, and my brain feels like it can't process this is reality. I feel disconnected from everything I do. For the past week, I have been just baffled in my own head that Michelle Obama is a real person and I'm aware that of course, she's real, but for some reason it just doesn't feel real. I also feel like I can't describe it, which I know it's particularly helpful.

Anyway, this is something that I haven't mentioned to my doctor. I've always felt like it's not a big deal or this is probably something everyone feels in some way. But I'm starting to get concerned, maybe it's something more. So if anyone is knowledgeable about dissociation - I would appreciate any of our thoughts. Thanks for reading this long post.

66,"I feel like I'm barely staying afloat right now. Feels like there's no future ahead of me. I've taken an extended period of time to travel, try new things and generally find something to be passionate about however it's been hard to stay dedicated to something. Even school, as much as I try, I'm eventually starting to fall off track. For the last couple years, I'd have these cycles of suicidal bouts where all I can think of is death. Taking too many pills or simply hoping that the train will run me over, hoping that I'll be the next drunk driver's victim. Other days are okay but recently, it's more frequently. I know I won't do it but it's always on my mind.

When I'm home, I'm also surrounded by my mother's mental illness. She refuses to get help, I've taken her to a psychiatrist but she refuses to take medication and thinks I'm trying to poison her. Despite countless reassurances, I'd come home from school to see her dump her medication. Other people intervening will only make her more frustrated. It's been really tough to interact with her recently because her emotions are always spiraling. Some days, she'll be throwing out my important documents and personal belongings. Next, she'll be paranoid that I'm getting kidnapped even though I'm at school. 

It's hard to focus at home but when I'm outside (occupying my time studying elsewhere or simply hanging out with friends), my parents and sister will call me a negligent daughter and say that I should spend more time with her. It's been very difficult because my father is cheating most of the time while my sister is living elsewhere with her boyfriend. I feel like I have no support and it's no one's fault.

I've gotten a whole lot better and more stable, and i don't think being close friends with him would wreck that anymore, but it wouldn't do either of us any good.

my ex boyfriends been diagnosed with both histrionic and borderline personality disorder, as well as adhd. not to condemn anyone with those issues - I suspect highly that my best friend has bpd and is simply not a destructive person. I know not everyone with these issues is, but my ex genuinely tries to be destructive. we were drug addicts together, and I know that didn't help and I have no one to blame for that but myself, but while I tried to maintain control he continually tried to break it. 

it was every damn day, him picking verbal fights with me, verbal and physical fights with friends and random people, getting pissed or bored and driving 100 mph in a 30 giggling as I begged him to stop. being ""bored"" even when sober (especially when sober) and, as a like 130 lb 6'1 man, literally barking like a dog at much larger ""thuggish"" looking men trying to provoke a fight. intentionally (I'd discover later) owing money to dealers so he could ask me to bail him out to prove how much I loved him. in the rare times he'd break down and be real with me, he'd admit that a large portion of his bs was to have proof of how muh I'd put up with and how much I'll help him out of trouble because he needs constant proof that I love him. another large portion of his behavior, he's told me during those rare times, is because he feels so bored and empty and numb that he just wants to feel somethig, anything, even somethig negative. just something.

I still maintain contact with him, haven't seen him in person in about a year. he's still an addict and I've gotten clean. I check up on him and sometimes I feel like he's getting better because the attempts to manipulate me back into his cycle of bs have dramatically decreased. sometimes I feel awful for no longer trying to take care of him, though, especially when I learn he's gotten himself into trouble.

I know this is probably the right thing to do for both of us. my being in his life more brought the worst out of him because he'd get into more bs to get me to ""prove my devotion"", and it brought the worst out in me due to stress and the fact that I repeatedly just could not turn him down when he ""needed"" my help. but the guilt, agh. those of you whove been theough somethig similar, how do you guys deal with it?",09Nov2018,1

Usual feel of things touching my body. Vibration. Itching. Sometimes like bugs walking on me. Nothing scary really, mostly just used to it. 

For so long i believed that i was special. That i had something in my brain that was powerful, that my mind could uncover so many secrets. I believed i had powers, i believed that energy and spirits were helping me, guiding me, with me. And i believe in them still, deeply. But for over a year i was hurt, and so i stopped believing. I stopped talking to them. I studied mental illnesses and convinced myself that i was probably crazy. 

But lately, i feel my believes coming back. I don’t t know how to explain it correctly. I remember all the amazing things I’ve witnessed, all the repetitive acts the spirits would do for me. Everything, i could manipulate. 

I guess for that year i stopped myself its been a 50-50 contradictory believes on my self and the world. Before i knew who i was, i had a mission, i was going to help save the world.

she agreed that he was on entirely the wrong meds for him (effexor) and switched it to prozac. he's been prescribed 1 mg 3x a day xanax for years and she immediately wanted him off that and tried to suggest multiple alternatives and keeps pushing it despite his explanation that that's nearly the only thing that helps and he's tried all the other alternatives she's suggested. I know she has to suggest alternatives to an addictive substance, but it's as if she's manipulating him into trying to get off it - saying that she thinks it's what's causing his anxiety  (huh?), claiming it's probably interacting negatively with his antidepressant despite all kinds of evidence that that's just not how it works, suggesting buspar as an ""alternative benzodiazapine to xanax"" thinking he knows nothing about meds and doesn't know buspar isn't a benzo..?   

some weird feelings of ""new"" anxiety and ocd like tendencies followed him being introduced to prozac. he told her about it and she upped the prozac, repeatedly mentioning that the xanax is probably to blame for everything. she knows he smokes weed during times of extreme stress and that that's the only other thing that helps, and she always tries to get him to stop that. he told her this last time that it's something he'd be prescribed in and not her state  (he had a medical marijuana prescription in a state in which its legal before he moved) and told her it's something that helps and it's his decision. she told him ""well some decisions can hurt you, if you don't stop smoking weed I guess I'm gonna have to stop giving you xanax I guess, my decisions can either help or hurt you too"". 

she told him she wanted to do genetic testing to determine whether or not ""xanax doesn't work on him"". he asked how genetic testing works and he replied ""hah, science, don't worry about it.""

she just seems like an arrogant bitch on a power trip to me. there are limited available psychiatrists that work with his insurance and this is the one attached to the therapist he likes. is there something he can do in terms of switching psychiatrists whilst keeping his therapist? will his seeing the therapist and getting her opinion on his issues calm his psychiatrist down if they share information? we're both genuinely concerned because she seems to just pull prescription suggestions out of a hat, suggesting anything from buspar to prozac to risperidone to straterra to muscle relaxers to solve the same issues of bipolar disorder and anxiety. just rattling them off one after another.

Im sorry if this is jumbled, i just got off an overnight shift and im panicking a little.

My mother was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia after an episode last year. She has major dillusions and she believed i was not me. Said another 'me' came to her and said i was kidnapped. She said someone shot her in the back, and fought with me but eventually allowed me to take her to the hospital, only after i told her if shes been shot she needs to go. This was all after a period where she couldnt sleep. 

Now, she refuses to believe she has it and says the doctors just want to lock her up as a conspiracy. And she gets super defensive when ive ever tried to get her help.

But all this week shes called me nonstop at work and during times where i need to sleep for overnights. She showed up at my bfs parents house looking for me when i didnt answer one call. 

Today, she called me constantly at work and i told her i have to wait til after my shift then id call her. I get home, call her, and immediately its "" havent slept in 24 hrs. Ive been looking at pictures of you as a child for the whole time. You are you right? You dont look anything like my daughter. How do i know you werent kidnapped and replaced. Like during yout trip to mexico or when you were abroad for years!! I keep having panic attacks. "" (not exactly as sporadic as this but the gist of the convo)

All i could think to do was tell her facts, look mom my tooth is still crooked, my eyes are the same, i just dye my hair, its okay. Im me. Then i told her to get some sleep. She seemed to calm down and she was talking normally but she still said ""ill have to look for your tooth in pictures then"".

My name is Ryan, and I am a Counselling Psychology graduate student at City University of Seattle (Calgary Alberta campus). For my thesis, I am really interested in levels of belongingness and stigma attitudes on mental health subreddits, as well as offline. I would LOVE to have your input regarding your experience on mental health related subreddits! The survey will only take about 15-30 minutes, and the results will hopefully help inform future research and clinicians about the world of Reddit. Each participant that completes the study will be entered into a draw to win a $50 gift card (2 available) to Apple or Google Play (whichever the winner prefers). Two winners will be chosen from the reddit usernames provided in the survey. Thanks for your time everyone, I greatly appreciate it!

I will be sure to provide an update after the study is complete, so everyone knows how their participation impacted mental health research.

Here is the Survey Monkey link to the study: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SNYN33Z](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SNYN33Z)

99,"Hi everyone, first time posting here. I was wondering if you guys would be able to help me with an issue I'm dealing with. Forgive me if I'm not explaining the situation as thoroughly as needed and I wasn't sure where else to post this. 

I currently have a family member abroad, aged 13, who's going through a tough time in school. I visited her recently and she opened up to me about the state of her mental health and its the first time someone has opened up to me this way. It was clear that she hasn't spoken to anyone else about this issue so I tried my best to help her by giving her words of advice, encouragement, and telling her that she can always feel free to speak to me whenever through WhatsApp after I got on the plane back home. 

When I was with her she stated that her mental health was not good and that she feels that she can't make friends because no one has the same interests as her, people have broken her trust and talk behind her back, she doesn't like the way she looks even thought people tell her she looks beautiful she doesn't feel like that inside. 

Recently she mentioned to me that she cries a lot, shakes, has trouble breathing sometimes, she sometimes gets suicidal thoughts.

I try to message and speak to her at least once a week so that she doesn't feel alone. I want to know what else I can do help her out because I really want to give her some sort of help, she's a good kid and she shouldn't have to be going through something like this especially at her age.

Thank you",09Nov2018,1

I've used it a bit recently and enjoyed it (first time I laughed in a while). I used to use it heavily (to the point where I guess it could've been classified as substance abuse) in my teens but that was over a decade ago now.

105,"Hi y’all 

So it was hard for me to accept my diagnosis. I know I’m being stubborn, but it was very hard. I know the first step is acceptance of my traumas that they are the past. I’m going to therapy getting psychiatric help and taking anti-anxiety medication. I know it just one day at a time. Any good words of advice would just make my day. ",09Nov2018,1
106,"I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and i'm wondering what type of bipolar I have because that has not been determined. I don't really understand the differences, so I will just explain my symptoms.

I wouldnt say I have mania where I am elated and reckless. If I do have mania, (when I notice the most anyway), my psychotic symptoms come in play the most. When i'm manic, I hallucinate more and get very paranoid, thus have trouble sleeping and am very restless. When I'm depressed, my psychotic symptoms are more rare.

I would say my emotions never come in moderation or different shades. I either feel an emotion to its utter completion or I dont feel that emotion. I never just feel a little down one day. If something triggered me to feel sad, i'm sad for days to the point of hideous crying, thoughts of self harm, and having to keep myself from going into a bad depressive episode just from a few things that normally would merely make someone sad for the day. My emotions are never felt in moderation: they are consuming and I feel them extremely. This also goes for happiness. Say, if I have a crush on someone, i'm IN LOVE WITH THEM. Obviously not really. It's just infatuation, but my feelings for them are so powerful I could have talked to them once a month ago and here I am writing 5 Shakespearean sonnets about one person. And it's a good feeling. But it's never just ""yeah they're cute.""

My episodes last very long times, and i'm still depressed in my manic episodes. As I said, I do not get elated. I just get paranoid and have psychotic symptoms. My depressive episodes last for 3 months and my manic episodes last for about that time back to back. Again, I still feel sad during mania. 

Sometimes I have little flashes of emotion that are all consuming for a couple hours or a few days. I could be in a depressive episode, but suddenly I do get this elated mania where i'm really confident, might be more flirtatious, a little more loose with money. Or I could be in a paranoid mania and have 3 days where i'm just depressed and not hallucinating/being paranoid as much, but then it hops back into mania. I would say these are separate episodes, but they're so short they dont feel like an entire episode.


Idk, what do you think?

107,"My husband (23M) has told me that he has hallucinations (voices, seeing black shadows of people that aren’t there) and since I have known him he has exhibited childlike behavior (claims it’s just his “personality”) but can act normal 50% of the time. I didn’t think much of it at first, but I’ve realized these are symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. I’m not sure how to nicely ask him to get help or ask him if he agrees that he shares a lot of the symptoms associated with the disorder. I truly want to help him, and his childish behavior is starting to affect our marriage as I feel like I married a 12 year old boy. Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

TLDR; husband has hallucinations, acts like a 12 year old and says it’s his “personality” (he is 23 years old) and it’s affecting our marriage. I believe he’s showing signs of schizoaffective disorder but not sure how to say so.",09Nov2018,1
108,"Okay, so kind of a long post but please bare with me.

I was diagnosed with ADD in 3rd grade and started taking stimulants then, so around the age of 11. I believe I was on Ritalin. I've been on some sort of stimulate since that age for the past 7 years. I've taken Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta (briefly), and Dexedrine (which is what I'm on now). I've taken some sort of stimulate literally everyday since the age of 11. Because I do homework on the weekends as well, I just figured it would be a good idea to take it those times to. I'd also take it during holiday breaks so that I wouldn't lose the habit of remembering to take it everyday. That's just how it's always been. I thought I had to take it everyday to like keep up a steady flow of the medicine. After I began taking stimulants, I became an extremely anxious child. Though my parents thought that was partially caused by the medication, they mostly thought it was a result of me entering puberty and middle school. But I've just ended up becoming a rather anxious and paranoid. Like, it's one of my main personality traits. And sort of dictates my life. 

So now I'm just starting college. It's two months and I am horribly, horribly depressed. Literally, I have such terrible, terrible mood swings and bouts of paranoia. Said paranoia has caused me so much trouble, even damaging several of my relationships. I constantly feel it. I'm constantly worrying. It's so exhausting. 

So I decided to go to a psychiatrist to get some help. She prescribed me Lamictal, thinking that I might be bipolar (two years ago, I tried to take Zoloft but ended up going manic as a result of it. Evidentially, a reaction like that is indicative of bipolar tendencies). 

So I see her a second time and I begin describing my anxiety, but she points out that my anxiety is atypical to most anxiety. My anxiety involves no physical symptoms. My heart doesn't beat fast, my hands don't get clammy. Nothing like that. I just get super, super, super paranoid. Horribly so. Like, I can't do anything else but worry and fret. Sometimes, during really bad episodes, I'll get weird ticks - like I'll become super aware of my breathing and blinking and both will become funny as a result. 

We got onto the topic of my Dexedrine and she found it really weird that I've been taking stimulants literally everyday of my life since I was 11. She then said that this might be the cause for my depression and paranoia. She was saying that it can build up in your system so much that it can cause a chemical imbalance, or something like that. She was saying that I should stop taking it everyday, and only when necessary - like when I have a test or when I have to do a lot of homework. 

My question is if this is true? I know she's an expert and that I'm asking strangers, but has anybody experienced depression or mood changes as a result of long-term use of stimulants? And am I abusing stimulants without even realizing it? Because I was reading somewhere else that abuse of stimulants can cause spurts of euphoria. Whenever I take my Dexedrine (particularly on an empty stomach), I'll feel super positive and confident and ""up"". But only really, really briefly. And I thought that that was normal? That everyone feels that after taking some of it. Is this not true? 

The reason why I'm asking is also because this psychiatrist, even though she's obviously an expert, does seem to have a bias against stimulants. She just seems to generally not like them. I asked her if she ever prescribed them and if she had something against them (because I know they're a controversial issue), and she said that she had no issue with them. But she did seem to have a negative view of them, and I'm wondering if such a view might by tainting her answer to me. ",09Nov2018,1
109,"I don't want to go into detail, but I've been really bad for the couple months. Now I finally decided to get help, but there's hangups. I go to college hours away from home in a rural/suburban hybrid area. There are very few therapists accepting new patients, and the ones that are don't take my health insurance (no possible way I can afford it without insurance). I went to my schools free counseling services and they don't have open slots that fit my work/school schedule this or next semester. 

I'm just really frustrated with it. I think my window of willingness to talk is closing and I just don't have options. Fuck.",09Nov2018,1
110,"I've lost motivation now. The counselor I've been seeing for a few months now told me I shouldn't expect to ever be cured to the point of being ""normal"". I've had symptoms of depression and anxiety (as well as weird, completely unfounded fear of abandonment) as long as I remember, at least since I was seven. My counselor told me that even with intensive therapy that burden will always remain, and that I should be looking at my future being one where I am functional instead of being completely happy and living a normal live. I'm 27 now and feel like I've been condemned for the rest of my life.

I will most likely never be able to work full time, and that means I will live in poverty for the rest of my life. Working 20 hours a week will be enough to keep me alive, but I'll have to cut out every expense I can. No gaming consoles, no vacations, no TV, no fancy meals, no hobbies that require financial input. I'll have to budget everything very strictly to keep myself afloat. And that's if I can even find a part-time job! I have autistic traits and  having to deal with people causes me huge amounts of stress. And where are all the part time jobs? Service sector. I simply cannot handle that much human contact.

I feel like my life is over. I have a Master's degree in science, but will never get to use that because it's not like there are part-time jobs in that. I would need to be able to work at least 40h weeks if not more, and it seems that's not realistic for me. I'm certainly not a person who would start their own business, that would be a nightmare. So there's a big chance I'll never even have a job and will have to survive on unemployment benefits. 

And before someone suggests therapy: I'm working towards that but it will take several months before I can even meet with a doctor. And  I need to see one before I can get financial aid from the government so I can pay for any therapy. And I was just told that even therapy will most likely not be enough to do more than keep me somewhat functional! It's like I've been given a death sentence, and I have a very hard time finding motivation to do anything at all.

Also, I'M NOT IN THE US, so keep that in mind.",09Nov2018,1
111,"For the past two or so months I [22F] have felt increasingly numb/disconnected towards most things. But I don’t feel depressed, or like I can’t have fun/a good time. It’s more like my body still feels things, but I’ve become just my thoughts. Like I’m not really making my body’s decisions but I’m not NOT making them either. If it sounds confusing, it’s because it is.

I’ve experienced many episodes of depersonalization in the past, but this isn’t really like that. It’s like I know I’m myself, I just don’t really feel like myself is anything. I have hobbies, friends, family, passions, etc and I put my all into those things, but I have this constant certain knowledge that tomorrow I could just drop any or all of them and begin being a new person. I don’t want to do that, because I enjoy all of them, but I know I could if I ever needed to.

I guess the whole world just feels very low stakes these days. Like I’m aware that nothing is very significant and most problems are easily fixable and it’s just emotions that make them complicated, so I just stopped being attached to my emotions. They still exist, but they barely affect me or my thinking.

I do drugs all the time these days. I don’t know why. I’ve spent hours and hours, high and sober, trying to find the root of what’s pushing me to this kind of escapism. But I’m coming up blank. I am always very aware of my emotions and have a super easy time tracing them back to where they’re stemming from. But as far as I can tell my drug use isn’t stemming from any sort of negative emotion. It’s more just because it’s the most enteraining way to pass my time, and being sober is dull because of the chronic disconnect.

Lately I can’t stop wondering if any of the negative experiences of my past were really bad. I had severe depression all through my adolescence that ended in a suicide attempt. But now I keep thinking that I just chose to reaffirm my negative thoughts, and to find/focus on hurtful moments, and to treat myself poorly. I was bullied for two years as a kid, but now I wonder if I just played up all these “problems” I had as a result because I wanted attention. I feel like I tricked everyone who knows about my past problems and the impact I’ve described them having on me, because I realize now that none of them are significant and I could shed all of my behaviors associated with them whenever. I just don’t because it would confuse people who know me. Again, thinking about all of this doesn’t upset or disturb me as far as I can tell. It just increases the sense that I don’t have any solid personality or identity.

Anyone else been through something like this?",09Nov2018,1

114,"You've come a long way. You survived 18 years and you can survive another 18.

You've been stuck in your brain for the past few years where you can't get out even if you wanted to. It's funny when people say that they care for you. Kinda ironic that no one knows anything that's happening in your life. They make you feel like you're so needy  when all you ask for is someone to check up on you like how you check up on them. 
You give in and fall for their words, some periods where you reach  the bottom  where you can't get out of bed, just completely give up on all the things and people you loved, carving symbols in your flesh, and asking god to take you into his arms since you didn't have the guts to do it yourself. 
Switch to this awesome crazy mood where you explored your sexuality, shaved your head, skipped most school days to go out and eat, stayed up all night because cause why the fuck not, and all these stupid moments where you felt  like you where on top of the world and no one can ever stop you. 

Going to a psychologist won't help because after a few psychologists visits and a few different diagnosis, all you can do is just continue life and do it yourself. Just remember that you've been through this before and you can get over it again. Be Strong. 🌟

All those hours wasted doing workbook after workbook just because she didn't understand that all I needed was some peace and quiet, all those nights spent crying myself to sleep, hoping the day wouldn't come, it's her fault. She was the one who blocked me from skipping a grade because apparently I wasn't socializing with my classmates and totally normal in terms of performance in school. Well guess what? I was friends with literally everyone in that class. Every. Single. Person. I spent my afternoons begging my mum to teach me things because I didn't learn shit at school.

118,"Depression started in my early twenties. Tried several approaches and landed on 150 mg of Wellbutrin daily. 

Past two weeks was feeling awful. No real sleep because I would wake up in the middle of the night and feel scared or feel like I was being watched. Same deal when I was in an empty room working late, felt like someone was sneaking up on me. I moved my work area so I could monitor both doors, I felt like I was being ignored and sabotaged at work even though I knew none of that was real, it felt real.

Wednesday was just really bad. Had a simple meeting with a coworker and I couldn’t stop crying and blabbering about other unrelated things. I took off work early and went to see my doctor. 

She told me to be mindful of my feelings. (Which I found to be ineffective and condescending it was mindfulness that was allowing me to know that there were no monsters in my bedroom every night).

She also put me on 150 mg Wellbutrin, added amatryptalene or however it is spelled, to take at night in addition to ambien, and a prn anti anxiety pill that starts with a v and is definitely not Xanax, I feel a lot better after only two days, but this is a lot of medicine.

What if this just keeps getting worse? My mom had severe depression and ended up unable to work and once she was home all the time on disability it’s  like she just gave up. She barely bathed, she wore the same clothes all the time to rags even though we had plenty of money. My dad and I would buy her new clothes and she’d refuse to wear them. She sat at the table and did crafts, napped, and gained over 100 pounds. In the years she was dead.

It may sound like an excuse, but it wasn't out of depression or anything like that (not ruling it out though), I just felt bored cause I had no friends or family to do things with and so being the introvert I am, I found comfort in solitude and making friends online, but possibly to a fault because it might be the culprit of all this. Another cause could be that I was anxious for about 3 months, but it did subside by the 3rd month and the memory problems came in a month or two after that.

Early 2019 I will go to the psychologist to know if I have something or not.

Actually I am 25 years old, when I was a kid I was hyperactive and after 11 years old I changed to be very calm. 
I have never shown my true personnality at my parents or friends, only with my girlfriend.
Im since 3 years with her and she thinks that I have a problem.

She told me : you are very different about others you seem crazy but not like ""bad""
She call me little crazy now lol

She call me like that cause in our appartment I'm very very different that when I'm outdoor , like 2 differents personnalities.

Outdoor I'm very stressed about others people.
This is my biggest problem : social anxiety

My other problem : I'm so angry and explosive.
Example : If my head hit a door Im gonna kick the door and I will really angry 30s - 1mn and I will be super calm after that like if nothing happened.

I kick always when I'am angry , I try to do not but it's very difficult.
And always objects never people. I don't want problems ... 

My gf told me she is afraided sometimes cause I'm like a monster. But I told her , kicking or breaking somethings is like a good meditation for me and it's true. Great relaxation

Now about my concentration : I found my school report (11 years old to 16 years old)  and on each semester I have "" inattention"" ""He's dreaming "" ""not concentrated"" ""Need more participation in class""

Yes, I know I can't concentrate on something lot of times.  I'm thinking all the time and the world in my head is really more simple lol
Just when I'm playing video games Im very focus. 
Or when I find a very nice subject to explore.

I have lot of ""passions"".  Not really passions but subject that I like because I change really often.
And passion about something come soudainely !
I explore it while 1 week intensely and I let it.

Today it's drawing tomorrow it will be cooking next day will be dinosaurs and after that psychology etc ...

People are surprising that I know lot of thing, they thing I do lot of studies lol but I stoped with high school diploma. 
I can't go to school is very annoying , and I prefer study by myself.

When I worked in factory it was so boring that I put my body on ""robot"" I made tasks but I was absolutely not in this world, it's like if I dreamed awake. Really interesting and I love it.

I'm also supersensitive, I can crying just cause I listened a music and imagined things  in my head.
Also I like thinking about bad or sad things and even cry when I'm gonna sleep. Not every days but 1 by week I think. For example : imagined that my girlfriend die and the police call me about that. What will I do ?  
This is sad but it relaxing me ...

One more thing : I'm not a very addict person, I don't drink no drugs, coffee 1 or 2 by week ( coffee seems to help me but I dont know if it's because I read something on it). 
I'm addict at two things sex and chocolate...

Can I just have a nice word or two? I just need to know that someone is out there and hears me. I can't even cry. I can't laugh. I just feel...nothing inside. This sucks. Thanks all.",09Nov2018,1

128,"TL;DR just venting, everywhere i seem to vent seems to attack me so I figured mental health would be somewhat safe

I know I am only 19 but I feel like I’m failing at life. I dropped out of University because I lost interest in the topic, now I kind of regret it because I gained the interest back. I live in a small town where nobody likes me because I was a shit disturber throughout the two years I spent in high school here. I have no gfs which sucks because my boyfriend has all these friends and I’m always tagging along and I feel ridiculous. I wish I could have female friends but I literally can’t seem to cooperate with them I guess. I’ve never found a gal I could click with. My parents kicked me out a week ago and we are on speaking terms now but still not going back because my stepdad can’t stand me because of his PTSD (literally told me once that his PTSD got better when I left so whatever thats nice) soooo instead I’m going to be staying with my boyfriend at my boyfriend’s parents until JANUARY 1st instead of December 1st BECAUSE NONE OF THE APARTMENTS IN THIS SMALL ASS SHITTY TOWN WILL BE AVAILABLE !!!! HAHA CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!!!!!!!!  ORIGINALLY I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN A CITY RIGHT NOW, IN MUSIC SCHOOL BUT AM NOT BECAUSE A WEEK BEFORE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO, WE FOUND OUT WE COULDNT BRING OUR CAT ??????!!!!!!!!!!!!! (And yes dramatic but she’s our baby ok) but yeah I honestly wanna die what’s up what’s new ",09Nov2018,1
129,"I’m a 17yr old girl, and I’ve been struggling with food issues, anxiety and stuff for a few years. My recent counsellor told me it’s not an eating disorder, so I really don’t understand what is going on in my head and would like any advice.

As brief summary - I started dieting about two years ago, this quickly swung into not eating at all. Then I discovered throwing up, and I realised that I could binge eat what I wanted and still stay skinny. Lately I haven’t been able to throw up as much as my family are aware of my eating problems, but I’m still eating the same amount and the weight I’m putting on terrifies me. 

Also, although I never have problems getting to sleep, i have struggled with terrifying dreams that feel real, and getting panic attacks in the middle of the night. I used to be a high achiever, but now I feel like I’m never good enough. I’m sociable, but a lot of simple situations make me anxious very quickly. However more often, I get anxious and I don’t know why I feel like that, as there is no obvious cause for my anxiety. I also struggle with concentration, and most of the time I feel disassociated from conversations like I’m ‘not quite there’. 

I have had several counsellors in the past, and plan to try a new counsellor, but waiting lists are long, so in the mean time advice would be appreciated.

A few weeks ago I made an attempt on my life and ended up in hospital for several days. I don’t understand why I feel so low, as nothing traumatic has ever happened to me, and I have good family and friends, and there is no history of people having similar problems in my family. It has felt really out of place and I don’t quite understand what is going on. I just want to understand why I feel so unhappy so I can fix it. Thanks any advice appreciated ",09Nov2018,1
130,"There's a lot of people who struggle hard just to have the most basic comforts in life. Food, shelter, peace are all simple things that everybody should have but many people fight hard to get. That definitely plays a huge role is people who have depression, anxiety, stress, guilt and those types of things could snowball into more serious issues. IMO quality of life is what drives a lot of people to the state of mind where they could end up as some under achieving individual who has settled for a mediocre life instead of pursuing higher goals or a homicidal/suicidal person or anything in between.

131,I don't know how to approach my parents about my mental health and possibly getting therapy. I haven't been evaluated for or diagnosed with any mental illnesses but from reading things and some self diagnosis I think there's a good chance I have depression and anxiety. I want to get checked and possibly diagnosed and try therapy but I don't know how to tell this to my parents. I'm a teenager and I know they would understand because they've told me about their past struggles with mental illnesses but every time I try to say something I freeze up and start panicking because I don't know what to say. Do any of you have some advice as to how I could approach my parents about this? Thanks in advance,09Nov2018,1
132,So last night I kept getting this weird feeling it was like a headache but not as severe and only on one part of my head. I went to sleep and woke up at about 3 in the morning feeling horrible. My stomach was hurting really bad and I figured it was because I skipped dinner. So I ate a snack and went to bed but couldn't sleep because I felt nauseous as hell. When I did manage to go to sleep I woke up late in the morning still feeling nauseous but this time I felt sorta disconnected. Throughout the whole day now I've been feeling a lot of anxiety and a feeling that's almost like I'm stoned. I feel really just sorta spaced out and not really with it. Like for example in the shower today I couldn't tell if I washed my body once or 3 times. I keep thinking the only explanation I can think if for this feeling is that somebody drugged me. But i know that ridiculous because throughout the whole previous day I prepared all of my food I ate. ,09Nov2018,1
133,"I’m a 23 year old female and 2 years ago I started therapy to help with my depression and anxiety. I was eventually put on WellButrin for the day and Mirtazapine for the night. I took them both for close to a year and they helped a lot. About 9 months ago I started to feel better and made the mistake of just stopping them when I ran out after the last refill. I felt fine up until about 2 months ago-my anxiety was coming back but my depression didn’t seem as prominent as it did. Recently I’ve had a few “episodes” some have been minor but the one I had today was really bad. I was at work and we get really busy. My heart started racing, I felt light headed, my hand started shaking and as weird as it sounds I felt like I was having a heart attack. I ended up puking a little bit and I ended up leaving work and going home to rest. Has anyone ever felt anything similar to this, or know much about panic attacks? I’ve never felt anything quite like this and I’m thinking about starting therapy again.",09Nov2018,1

135,"Do basically lately i have been twitch and my mom would get angry when i would twitch, she kept suggesting to take me to a funny farm and even wanted to take me to church because she believed it was demons. Im an agnostic Buddhist so i guess that why. Also she didnt like the fact that i told her im bi. But today are started to yell our random curse words but i couldn’t control so im trying to hold it in butbits giving me a massive migraine. She also suggested making me live my abusive mood swinging father to help me but all he would do is beat me and take me to church as well sense he doesn’t believe in therapy or mental illness. Which im pretty sure he has a problem. I don’t know what wrong  and why this happening. I think also showing signs of autism, like hiting my self when im angry, feeling the need to scream when im stress, getting angry when stuff isn’t correct, repetitive movements like snapping and clapping, and etc. i don’t know what wrong. This happen a little bit before but i dont know the problem.",09Nov2018,1
