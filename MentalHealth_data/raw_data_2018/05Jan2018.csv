It is a cry for help, I'm too scared to face this alone and was hoping someone would inform my parents, doctor, or idk someone who could help me.

1,"I'm not sure if this is /r/ADHD or /r/Maladitivedreaming or something else.

The specific example was that I was reading an article on things that a specific thrift store wouldn't accept.  The item was live animals.  I suddenly created this fantasy around being a thrift-store worker and having to deal with people trying to donate various live animals.

One of them involved rabbits and saying that I would eat them for dinner.  (The closest I've come to butchering an animal has been dismembering roast-ready poultry.)

I also haven't studied maladaptive dreaming enough to really figure out what the problem is.  Constant daydreaming is part of my process in trying to write stories.

I have lapsed into fantasy while people were trying to talk to me, but the problem was noted in gradeschool and never addressed.

2,"I love my wife, more than anything. She’s sweet and incredibly noble, been friends for almost two decades, five as a couple, two married. 

However lately she’s been having fits of mania, specially characterized by gaming addiction. This has been affecting her life: barely sleeping, bad mood if not playing, no motivation in her work. Every time I’ve tried to talk with her about it she gets extremely defensive yet she recognizes it’s a problem. She changes a couple of days just to come back with vengeance.

All her life she’s been taking meds to help her cope with anxiety and depression. She used to have schizoid episodes as teenager and young adult, later she was diagnosed with BD. Her first years she took a lot of meds but for the last 7 she’s been only on alprazolam for anxiety and Prozac for depression. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to help her. Please, any advise will be welcomed. ",05Jan2018,1
3,"Hello, I wanted to know if anyone can help me identify what I’m going through


Lately, I’ll get raptured into some really strong daydreams or thoughts.  

I don’t hear anything while I’m in these trances, and my parents (it’s usually around my parents) have to snap me out of it.

Some of it is benign, like escaping into the wizard of world, or getting tattoos I’ve always wanted. Sometimes I’m riding a horse, or exploring an entirely new world. 

Often, it’s dark. I’ll imagine running away, and not coming back. I think of places to stay, how I’d survive. I’ll begin to sweat and grow nervous. My heart will beat faster and sometimes, I’ve been known to jump up from my seat.  I’ll get into a nervous wreck. I’ve packed my bag before, but I never actually get around to doing it. 
Sometimes I imagine my suicide. I look to find places I might hang, I imagine tying the knot. Sometimes I find the pills and hold them in my hand. Sometimes I see cars and wonder what it would feel like to be run over. I sometimes think about bleach, or electrocution. Then I imagine the gruesome death and opt not. Just as in my running away daydreams, I get flighty and restless. I often write suicide notes. 

Also, I get extremely overwhelmed by loud noises, or noises that do not keep tempo with my mind’s tempo. I don’t know if that makes sense, but certain “off tempo” noises  (like children crying pattern is off beat to the truck’s wheel cycle, and none of that goes with the conversation that’s being held right next to me) irritate me. They really shouldn’t, there’s no reason a child should cry to the cycle of a truck’s car wheels. I just keep track of the world that way and when the world does things like that, I go all “I AM A PREY ANIMAL I MUST FLEE FROM THIS WEIRD LAND”  and that’s really not helpful for anyone. 

Should I be worried about the suicide thoughts? ",05Jan2018,3

5,"Is there any psycological reasoning in comparing one's own situation with something that could be much worse? I can't wrap my head around it. Is it as simple as trying to get a patient to get in the mindset that they should be happy/lucky that they are not worse off?

I've been seeing my therapist for 3 years now for mostly depression,anxiety (panic attacks), and OCD. However the past 1.5 years has been half focused on pain management. This is due to a sudden degeneration of my spine and and accident that lacerated my right (hand) fingers, where I never fully regained function from and have issues doing certain tasks with my right hand.

These two issues are now causing constant pain that have limited or stopped my abilities to do what I once enjoyed. I was told by a neurologist that I should be ""thankful"" that I can even feel pain, because a lot of people in this world have a condition where they can't. REALLY... you're going to make me feel better by comparing me to people with CIPA? There are like a handful of newly documented cases of that a year.

I really like my therapist, but because we were on the topic of pain again and how this makes my depression worse, because of all the things I can't or have limited ability to do like, play the piano, guitar, play golf, hockey or ski. I don't know if she has run out of things to say, but all she said was, ""at least you still have your right hand"" or ""people still ski or [insert activity here] even though they have a missing arm or leg(s).

I don't know if this is suppose to help in some way, but to me it seems like a pretty shitty thing to say to a patient. If something happens to someone where it is life altering, then that is the worse thing that they have to go through at the time or even life. So I don't understand the constand need for professionals to say that ""I could have it worse"". Everyone could have it worse in some way shape or form!",05Jan2018,18
6,"Hi guys first time contributor here.
I will try to get a tldr somewhere down there for the people that are not really willing to read all this - which I can understand - but I'm really looking for advice or stories or discussions with people that went - or are going through - something similar. English isn't my native language, so excuse me for any errors in writing. 

First off like the title states I have a strong feeling my mother is someone that suffers from borderline, and I need help, advice or just a talk with people that can somehow relate to my post. Some backstory:

I am a 23 year old male, living together with my girlfriend and two cats since two years. I started a video production company three years ago with two business associates and travel Europe for my work. I kinda like to think that I am starting to get my shit together since I started making my hobby a money generating machine, although I slowly am figuring out I'm a broken guy deep down, mainly because of the title. 

I grew up in a family with my mother and half brother. Besides my grandparents I have no further family that I have a connection with. My mother always had a rocky life as long as I can remember. Lots of boyfriends came and went, so did her friends. I truly think she did the best she could bringing us up as a single parent, but when my brother and I became of an age where we could kinda think and decide for ourselves, our relationship with our mother has deteriorated quickly. My brother and I are now both at the point that we both do not want to have any sort of contact with our mother because of her toxic behaviour around us. She manipulates, lies and tells the whole world that they are crazy, except her. Girlfriends are and were never any good, and she would manipulate us to end it when she thought that that was what should happen. 
The final fight we had what made me stop my contact with her was because of a business dispute. She argued with my about the fact that I didn't give her any chances with getting her clients for her new startup business. Mind you that my mother has tried to start a business more times than I can count and she always failed. And of course it was never her fault. She actually threatened me with repercussions that "" I would not like"" if I did not contact her a day after her last text.

This made me decide enough is enough. I gave her a final option. Either she would go into a new therapy program where she gets a thorough examination if she suffers from borderline or not, or I will cut off all ties with her for ever. She has been in therapy with someone for like six months, and she keeps telling me now that her therapist made a report that states she does not suffer from borderline disorder. I do not believe that whatsoever. I want to be there from the start, to see and hear the therapist /psychologist do it's job. I feel empty inside. My mother still has some power over me that she can make me doubt my feelings, actions, everything. That's another reason why I don't want her anywhere near me, till I get that final call from a professional that can tell me ""hey, take everything she does and says with a pinch of salt, she is mentally ill."" it's all I need. But she won't accept my only demand to take action. Hell, she even turns it around and tells me I'm the one that needs professional help because of my mental health. 

Let me give you some pointers why I think she suffers from borderline disorder.

- her relationships come and go. Love, friends. All of them. She does not have any close friends. None. She had more boyfriends in my lifetime than I had pimples as a teenager. 
- she never sees her wrongdoings or flaws, only if she can find any pride in it she will admit to it. (ex. ""Im always straight to the point and honest!"")
- she always tried to stop me from growing up. She actively tried to stop me from going to college out of town, and always tried to keep us close. Even recently she said we could always live in her house. She says this regularly.
- she tried to commit suicide multiple times in my lifetime. I honestly believe most of the attempts were cries for attention.
- she never sincerely thanks people close to her for all the things they do for her. She will cuss them out when they do something wrong.
- she manipulates people around her to stand on her side in a fight. She also seems to get a kick out of creating drama.
- she always seems to have an alternative creation of the truth as opposed to other people.
- my grandmothers second husband hung himself because of the manipulation my mother did towards my grandma to leave him because ""he was no good."" This man build a home for my mother and me and my brother when she divorced from my brother's father, gave her a car and cared for me and my bro. 

I can go on for a lot longer, but my fingers would hurt from typing. They already do actually.
Now that I'm getting older I'm starting to see how damaged I actually am and that I may need serious help to get my inner inner self back together. I truly believe that my mother did the best she could, but at the same time now that I'm really diving into the possibility of borderline I discover so many things that was plain wrong in my youth.

The only family I have that I love with whole my heart and trust with my life are my grandparents, but they won't be around for much longer. The only parent I have is my mother -my father left before I was born. - and she seems to be the most unstable, unhealthy factor in my life right now. I want and need an diagnosis from a professional to find peace in our relationship, and she will not accept that demand. I feel like I have no choice but to cut her out of my life forever. What should I do? I am looking into getting a psychologist myself for this and other stuff that shaped me as I am now besides the issue at hand. I really hope some of you can offer me insight, tips or share stories with. This is affecting me daily and it sucks. Thanks guys.

Tldr: think mother has borderline, want her to go see a professional for this, she declines, I won't have any relationship with her till she accepts my demand for this. ",05Jan2018,1
7,"I’m just going to get right to it. I’m doing this thing recently where every time I’m like I don’t like this thought I will then follow that up with telling myself “yes you do” and then it feels like I do. Or Ill be feeling anxious about something and then tell myself “this doesn’t bug you, your not worried”  or “you like the thought of that” it feels like all my worries are gone. It’s super odd and very concerning. Has anyone else heard of or experienced anything like this? It just feels like I’m starting to not care about anything at all.I just started today taking Zoloft so I’m hoping this will eliminate this new challenge in my life.  ",05Jan2018,3
8,"I'll try to keep it to the point.

Just talked to the girl I love and she said she thinks about suicide ""like twice a day"". But that she ""obviously won't do it"". She has a kid (5y.o.) who is the world to her so I'm not like exactly panicking, though I can't know how much wishful thinking is coloring this perception either. Regardless, it's obviously an issue, she also has issues with depression and anxiety. The details and reasons don't matter too much I guess, not here at least.

My real question, or two, is:

- Do you have any advice on asking her to get help?

I tried to touch upon it during our conversation, but obviously she's defensive about it, Saying things like ""oh, but I'm obviously not going to do it"" (as in suicide, not counseling), or that she has always been this way, apparently since 5 she felt like she didn't belong in this world and so that's just the ""kind of person she is"", I didn't try to impose too much.

- How to pick a councilor?

I just opened google maps and now have 15 tabs of local mental health centers, what are my considerations supposed to be?

- Any other advice?

12,"So my mother has schizophrenia, and sever bi polar tendencies. 
And schizophrenia tends to be hereditary. When I was ten she pulled me out of school and locked me in our house. Double deadbolts on the doors, burglar bars on the windows, you get the jist. The reason for this was because of the 'cameras' and how everyone was against us. Think the trueman show. She would scream for hours on end to the people watching and make threats about killing me and her self if they dont show them selves. But that is besides the point, after I left , for years after I had periods of time where I would kinda checkout. I cant really remember what happened during those times, and as far as people tell me I would just fly off the handle, and blame people for things that didn't make sense, I would do really dumb stuff and fight people I love. I would just do things that I cant explain why I did them and would normally never do. I have been going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist regularly for years, and I have been given every diagnosis in the book. Things like bi-polar/ aggressive, bi-polar/manic, clinical depression and things like that.

13,"Plagued with feelings of worthlessness, loneliness, and apathy, even as I'm surrounded by reminders that directly contradict them. One thing that always picks me up is productivity, and the more literal the better (i.e. if I actually have a literal *product* by the end). I need a hobby, and I need one bad.

The main problem is I don't know what. Blacksmithing, woodworking, making jewelry, knitting, whittling, origami, and probably many others have all held a fascination for me at some time or another. (As a rule, the visual arts are a no.)

The secondary problem is I don't know how. It seems like many of these things take considerable skill developed over years of practice, muscle memory, specialised tools- a high barrier to entry.

What I am looking for in a response:

a. primarily, your experience with any possibility you think I'd like (even if it's only because you do) especially as it relates to your mental health,

14,"Hi all. I never really posted on a subreddit for this before out of fear someone from school would see making bullying and stuff worse. Because I still partially have that fear, this post will mainly be a discussion in regards to medications/ a vent about it. Apologies in advance for length as there is definitely other stuff I want to say but arent comfortable to yet. Kinda been building up for years... To start off, aside from abuse since age 5 (now 18), I have axiety, depression, ocd, adhd, sevant asperers, bipolar, and went through a stage of psychosis like symptoms. I've never really been able to make friends, but got used to that. In the past, I was isolated but able to consistently get things done. Ive always been extremely good with computers and electronics, getting my first job in IT at 15. One issue I consistently have is feeling restricted by medications/slowed down by them (if that makes sense). I started taking medications after being diagnosed with bipolar and adhd at about 8 years of age. Since then, Ive felt like a lab rat always having them switched, with nothing ever working properly. I've been to at least 28 different shrinks over the years. Interestingly enough, the only thing that has helped me the most is medical weed. Going back to the restricted mind, it has prevented me from doing tests, focusing on work, etc. its not that I cant focus (as concerta does help with that at least) but i cant think and blank. When I smoke, I have no issues and can fly throught it. I was going to get a green card however my previous psychologist (the longest standing one I was actually starting to like) unfortunately though he died from a heart attack end of november. My current one has no idea about the process for it, and mainly just perscribes my pills and refills. nothing more. I want to look into it more but am also affraid of being judged or people thinking im just some teen who wants an excuse to get high when in reality its that I just want to be able to get shit done and function. So thank you if you have read this far first off. Second was wondering people opinions of medical weed and if it is a good idea or not, or if they know any medications that may help instead (although doctors dont usually provide what i think may work they like to guess). Will definitely provide current list if thats the case. Thanks everyone! Honesty glad there is a place like this. ",05Jan2018,1

Drinking this early how dare you, piece of trash.

20,"Hi. I'm 19 and in university.

It's as the title says. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for a few years now (haven't actually been diagnosed), and it only gets worse as time passes. It leaves me unable to do a lot of things that many people don't think much of, but most importantly it is really hindering my ability to study. I don't love studying, honestly, but right now it's the only thing I have going for me. I skip a lot of classes, I don't hand in my assignments, I don't do any homework and I don't study for any quizzes or exams. I realize it sounds as if I'm lazy, and who knows, maybe I am. But the truth is that I don't want things to be this way. I want to be able to work hard, and enjoy life. I have dreams and aspirations and ideals I want to work towards. I love life.

However, while I do want to live and be happy, I can't help but have suicidal idealizations. I do not want to commit suicide, and I don't think I will, but it's the first thing that comes to mind whenever something even slightly bad happens. I used to be suicidal but I've worked hard to improve myself (more about this below) and I've come to realize that it's possible to live a good life even if you've been depressed. The thoughts I have are vivid and grotesque, so I won't describe them here. I know these thoughts are because of the depression, but I strangely feel as if I'd be getting what I deserve if I were to commit suicide in such a way. I used to hate myself, but to be honest, it's too much of a bother. I don't hate myself, I don't hate anyone. I just want to get better and live.

I feel as if I've had a less than decent childhood, in some aspects. My mother was overprotective and emotionally abusive, while my father was mostly absent. Because of this, I am overly dependent on others and am unable to do a lot of things by myself. I do not blame either of my parents, and I don't feel any resentment towards them. If I was in their place, I don't think I could do anything differently even if I wanted to. I'm afraid that I myself am an abusive person at times, but I am working hard to change that.

I have done a lot to battle depression and anxiety by myself. I have read a lot of books to help me understand how depression works, how the brain works, how to make and break habits etc. I've also watched videos and browsed different subreddits. But not only have I digested all this information, I've also made changes to my daily routine. Although not anymore, I used to get up at 4:30 AM, I used to exercise, eat healthy, I meditated daily, I listened to podcasts, I had side-projects I wanted to work on, I planned my days and weeks, and lived productively.

But even after all that, I got nowhere. I didn't give up on changing my life when I fell out of the routine, it just sort of happened by itself. I feel this is a recurring pattern in my life, that I can't hold onto a new habit or routine for more than a few weeks, no matter what I do or how much I want it.

I have thought a lot about why I am the way I am, and it comes down to two main things. One is, of course, not being able to study. I can't study so my grades suffer, my stress increases, and I get extremely depressed. And because of that, I can't study. I can't study and I'm depressed, so I might as well not go to class. Or do any homework. I haven't studied or gone to class or done any homework, so there's no point in studying now. And that's how the cycle goes on. This has happened for every semester so far.

The second reason, and this is more difficult for me to admit openly, is that I'm addicted to porn. It's an extreme addiction, I tell you. People may have different opinions about this, but regardless of what is true and what isn't, it's an addiction, and I want to get rid of it. I've visited NoFap and pornfree and other subreddits, but I just can't manage to quit. This is the main reason why I'm depressed, I think.

I want to heal from this by myself, and I know it can be done. I don't want my friends or my family to find out, although I believe they already suspect me. I can't see a professional, and besides, there's so much I've learned over time about depression that I feel I'd be wasting their time. My parents don't want me to go, and I can't go by myself. I can't afford medication, either.

There's so much I want to say, but then I'd be writing on forever and won't post this until it's perfect.

I want to help myself, what should I do?",05Jan2018,7
24,"So lately I’ve had a lot of trouble falling asleep. I’ll lay in bed tossing and turning for 2 hours before I even begin to fall asleep. And usually two hours turns into four and so on because every time as I’m about to fall asleep I feel bugs crawling on my arms. Well, last night as I jolted awake from the bug crawling sensation I realized that I had been whimpering as if I were crying for help right as I was about to actually fall asleep. This brought a sense of familiarity, as I realized that it wasn’t the first time I’ve whimpered in my sleep. Like I suddenly remembered that it’s been something that’s been happening constantly before this one time but I was too tired when I noticed it to have remembered it in the morning. 
I know I don’t have bed bugs or anything of that sort because I had the same issue when I slept over at a friends house a few nights ago. 
Does anyone have any idea as to what could be causing this? 
I’m not like traumatized or anything so this makes no sense to me . 
I should also add that I have anxiety, but lately it’s just been terrible. Specifically at night. It’s to the point where I see figures out of the corner of my eye and I get so scared I actually flinch until I realize that nothings there. Ive also been horrified with the idea of being alone lately. I always need to be around my sisters or mom when I’m in the house. But during the day it’s like my life is completely normal, besides being terribly sleep deprived.

27,"Hi,

so basically what I was going through (mentally) last year was just insane. First half Derealization/Depersonalization, second half Depression/OCD but feels like psychotic, because everything seems so surreal. I was diagnosed with OCD and adjustment disorder btw. OCD and not psychosis because I know those feelings and thoughts are somewhat strange.

So basically I recovered from Depersonalization last year...but as the symptoms slowly vanished, I still battled irrational thoughts from day to day when suddenly my mind switched to: ur life is over. I was overwhelmed, suddenly paranoid of time/the date, feeling like I shouldnt be here anymore as the time went on and feeling like trapped in this concept of time.

This feeling...it feels like I shouldnt be alive anymore since August, like I shouldnt have lived past August and should be dead until August. It just feels like it is wrong to be alive, everything feels so odd, when I go to the hairdresser for example, my mind goes like this: You are dead inside, you died, you dont need to do this, you are trapped in hell, you shouldve killed yourself as I told you! When I look in the mirror: ""Why are u still alive?"" It just cant make sense why I am still alive, and I am super overwhelmed, feeling insane, because I know something IS TERRIBLY WRONG IN MY ORGANISM.

You may ask yourself why ""August""? I dont know, I somehow wanted to be recovered and fine from mental health issues until August, I didnt know what would happen if I didnt recover until then, but my mind has adapted to my expectations and as the time went on without me recovering, my mind realized that and switched to this surreal psychotic limbo mode, so basically I guess false expectations triggered this mess in my mind.

I remembered when these thoughts sneaked in in the last week of July, I felt like after this week I would pass like a strange ""threshold"", like my old self had to die (idk it felt so strange, I just got very depressed, nervous and obsessed with the future and thought if I couldnt cope I may commit suicide, but I wasnt suicidal)

It felt like life after July was just black, I didnt want the future to come and felt like I was involuntarily pushed to experience this future pain, but then there was the 1st of August where I had these painful thoughts that I cant live anymore and got anxious. And this whole ""anticipation"" made me BELIEVE that this is destiny and I cant recover from it!

Furthermore I told my psychiatrist that I feared that I'll lose myself in time, which I know sounds strange but I definitely felt like there would be no future for me and honestly I keep questioning how I survived the last months, making me feel like I shouldnt be alive because the feelings were so surreal. I cant stop thinking that this shit is something supernatural and keep questioning if people had already commited suicide if they would have been in my shoes, what freaks me even more out.

But I have no clue how to get out of that hole at all. I am depressed and scared to death. I dont know, this is just a nightmare and I am 19.

Everytime I think about me as a person, I get a feeling of doom: who is ""I', why am I still alive? Etc. It is terrifying. The most terrible feeling is that I truly desire death and that it is the only option and THAT I WILL REGRET IT IN THE FUTURE NOT HAVING DONE IT.

I imagine myself in the future, at a fun event for example, having these feelings and it is freaking me out, feeling like I should do it right now. It is causing me a lot of pain. SURE THING IS THAT I TRULY DO NOT DESIRE THESE FEELINGS BUT CANT LET THEM GO EITHER :(

31,"Hey mentalhealth-ers,

So I am writing this because I feel completely overwhelmed. I have motivational problems with cause me to procrastinate making life changes that I feel would probably be important for my long term mental health. Anyway, this post isnt about my issues, but more about how to handle the beginning of getting help.

Two days ago I reached out to a therapist who I feel fits my needs well. I had talked to my wife about this, but more in the I dont know what to do stage, and at that point I was just trying to figure out how to fix myself. I dont think I can without help. So this morning, I finally got the courage to tell her I was going to see a therapist. It was on the tip of my tongue for a couple days now. She of course, was worried that I needed to go because of our relationship. Sure its not perfect, but I love my wife, and dont see that as a problem in my life, although I am sure I will find some things I can work on to make our relationship even stronger.

Anyway, I find myself feeling much worse than I did before I made the decision to see a therapist. I am nervous, anxious and scared at what this means for me. I think now that someone else in my life knows that I am going to see somebody, it makes me feel like its real and I do actually need help. I guess I am having a hard time dealing with the fact that I feel like I need help.

Anyway, onto the part where I would love to hear from all of you. Did you feel intensely unsettled after you first reached out for help, but prior to your first meeting? Did it feel similar to any of you when you told your SO? and did they have feelings that it was related to them even if its not? Did you feel better after your first session?

I would love to open a dialogue with anyone who has gone through this who wants to have a short back and forth just to talk through some things about the process of starting therapy.

TLDR: about to have first ever visit with a therapist. It was hard telling my wife. Now I feel overwhelmed at the idea of seeing someone for help. Can anyone share how they felt before and after therapy and how their SO reacted (if reason for therapy was not relationship issues).",05Jan2018,1
32,"I've posted before. I'm sorry if I'm a broken record. I just need to keep reaching out.

I have a history of abusive relationships and resulting PTSD, which I say because it's true and is a compounding factor to my current situation. Up until last month, I would say my PTSD/trauma response was in a better place than it had ever been. I was in a stable, safe living environment and it's truly amazing the work one can do when one has achieved safety. Living with my husband and our dog and going back to school to advance in my field; I finally felt like I was getting somewhere in life.

And then my husband got sick. I took him to the ER and they transferred him to the ICU. Three weeks later, I held him in my arms as he died. Today I finalized his memorial plans.

I've been reaching out to get help and support since he was transferred to the ICU. (That sense of safety and security? Sort of gone when husband was in ICU in a coma.) He went into the ICU on November 17. The hospital would only give me suicide hotlines to help. (Whether or not I am, the psyche ER wanted to give me meds - a LOT of meds - ""until you can get a private therapist"" and I have real specific opinions on ""medicating until you find help on your own"" and on medicating grief. A huge chunk of my PTSD was going along with this line of thinking after being raped and after an abusive relationship and not being able to process trauma correctly.)

I need help processing and support during the grieving process. This looks, according to google, like it's done through therapists. Great. I'm not a huge fan of medicalizing grief but if it's what I got it's what I got. I am separated from my family and culture of birth and thus cannot partake in culturally appropriate grieving rituals so I will go with mainstream American ones.

But I can't find anyone. 

The grieving groups in my area are all for straight people - even most of the online ones for spousal loss are for straight couples. Being a man who lost my husband drops my in a great empty painful sea and even though some other people have shitty life rafts, I can't get on one of them.

The therapy situation is... not good. I've filed for intake with two groups, who've said that they hope to fit me in sometime in the early spring. Pretty much everyone else with LGBT competency isn't taking on new clients or, as the ONE person who got back to me saying she could take me as a client, charge almost $200 a session. I'm a social worker and dealing with all of the monetary problems of having lost my husband, who was the breadwinner in our household. I can't afford almost $800 in therapy.

I looked into online therapy and I'm leery of it. Better Help seems entirely texted based, which I do not think will help me when I need a sense of direct rapport and support. There are some who do skype sessions, but I'm worried about privacy - I am currently staying with friends who do not want me to be alone but I just have a bedroom and the sound proofing isn't perfect. 

I'm in the US. I'm aware that our mental health safety net is... bad. But I really feel like I'm sinking fast and doing everything I can to keep my head above water. But I don't know how to find support if everything is supposed to be medicalized (or for straight people) and I'm just a lower middle class queer who can't get into either group?

tl;dr: I am queer and grieving and I can't find support groups or therapy.",05Jan2018,1
34,"I have a normal life and a loving family and friends. I have hobbies and the like and I can talk to people well. But everyday I have this suffocating feeling, a dreadful sensation that leaves me exhausted. I have persistent negative thoughts such as ""I'm not good enough."", ""I have to try harder. This is shit."", ""Everyone would be better off without me."", ""Everyone is just pretending to get along with me."" and no matter how hard I try, they are always there. I feel really stupid for feeling that way but I cannot get rid of it no matter how many people tell me that's not true. I also cut myself in my left arm and hide it from people. I pinch my left hand till they leave marks or till my skin peels off. Sometimes, it also bleeds. I also hit myself hard in the head whenever I'm irritated by myself or someone else because I believe that I'm always at fault. I discussed a part of this with my mom before, and even though she was understanding, it didn't really help me. She told me to suck it up and stop being so sensitive or being a drama queen. Even though I knew that was going to be her response, I can't help but feel even more worse. It also discouraged me from telling her more of it because I feel ridiculed of how I feel everyday, like it's something I can get over with. I know it's stupid to feel this way when I know that someone loves me and that people tell me that I am an achiever, but for me, it doesn't seem that way. I feel like an utmost failure, a mistake. I shouldn't have been even born. I've been having suicidal thoughts, too many to count for the past few years. I also wrote a suicide note for an instance when I actually commit it. I have several plans on how to kill myself but yeah... I confessed this to my boyfriend but I don't want to bother him too much because I know that he has problems of his own too. He tries to stop me from harming myself though. But when I don't cut myself, I feel like I don't punish myself enough and it's driving me crazy. I don't think I need any professional help but what do you think I should do?",05Jan2018,2
36,My sister is having a hard time. We're not sure with what. She's been increasingly less open with everyone including her boyfriend (who she has described as her best friend whom she can tell everything to). There are things that she says she wants to do or rather things that she needs to do. She is not doing them. If we try to talk to her about it she gets angry. We don't expect her to tell us anything she doesn't want to. However it's not good to hold things up inside. We try to advise her to speak with a counselor at least yet that makes her angry as well.

40,"Hello lovely people!

This is my first post, so if sorry if the formatting is a bit off, or if there's a better place for this post- I'm just after a bit of advice!

While my own mental health isn't as peachy as I'd like it to be, I'm more concerned with what's going on with my boyfriend's noggin, and how I can help if possible. 

**Soooo, some background:**
We are both British university students in our second year (19F and 20M), having met and started dating a little over a year ago. 

Bf feels like he's under immense pressure to take over the family business, and be successful as his dad is. However, while he acknowledges it's a great opportunity, it's something that he never asked for and as the only son, his future is pretty much set in stone. For a few years, he tried to push against this idea: studying art, and refusing to work for his dad. But as he's gotten older, he's realised it's pretty unlikely he'll do anything else- he feels he needs to come up with a awesome get-rich-quick business plan in the next year(s) before we graduate so he has an excuse to do something other than work for his dad.

I knew that this was causing him stress, but I've only just realised how much. For example, high blood pressure runs in his family and after a few weeks of unexplained heart ache and occasional dizziness (and a lot of nagging from me), he went and got it checked out. It turns out that he also has high blood pressure, and is more at risk of heart attacks etc. However, being so young this isn't caused by lifestyle factors (although he does drink and smoke) but rather stress.

When he talked about it with his mum, they agreed it was probably for the best that he look into counselling to see if that would help. He applied for counselling offered by our uni, and despite having ridiculously long waiting times, he's received a positive reaction (I don't know what they offered him, he didn't really want to go into it too much).

However, when I ask about it he said he's decided not to go, that he's a ""big boy"" and can deal with it himself. This is incredibly frustrating, as I feel like the advice I give isn't the best and I'd much rather he also had a professional to talk to. When asked why, he said he felt he didn't deserve help because he's grown up with a complete family unit, never had much economic trouble and that he should be grateful for the opportunity.

It's also really worrying: bf mentioned that he's always thought that he'd kill himself if by 25 he wasn't a success (I guess defining success in monetary terms as his dad does). He feels like a waste of space, with his dad saying that higher education is a waste of time and that he should have immediately entered the family business, and not being supportive at all. 

I'm writing this post because of something he said last night. Basically that for as long as he could remember, he's gone to bed every night wanting to kill himself but that he couldn't do it because of his mum already losing a son (childhood illness), and that he knows he won't be as good as his dad at family business so ""what's the point?""

He's gotten very good at putting up a mask of confidence and capability, and I think I'm the only person he really discusses his insecurities with. Even so, he doesn't share everything because when he did this with an ex, things got ""weird"" and they broke up for a short amount of time.

I really want to help, but I feel like whenever I raise the issue of counselling he says it didn't work in the past and to drop the subject. I feel like if I keep talking about it, it'll drive him further away from taking it up, but the fact he applied in the first place is encouraging, I guess. 

What do? :(

**TLDR:** bf is depressed because of family pressure (which is unlikely to change), but won't consider counselling. How can I help?",05Jan2018,1
43,"Hi so, last night we had a bit of a situation that puts me at a strange crossroads, but I'll get to that.    
So I've known and been friends with my girlfriend for about a year and a half, we're both 18, met in high school, and are now going to the same college. We started getting really close about 3 months ago and almost 2 months ago started dating. We've been really happy together and I'm fully committed to staying with her through anything.    
We're in the same friend group and she's talked to us in the past about how she sometimes sees spirits and they come to her. It was much worse when she was a kid but she's since learned to block them out.    
I've never believed in that kind of thing really, but I don't think she's lying at all, so I didn't know what to think.    
Things have been going well for a long time for her but yesterday she told me she's too tired to hang out that day, that she couldn't sleep because of a new spirit that started coming to her. She also told me to be careful driving and pay attention to the world around me. I accepted that, told her it's no problem, and that I'm here for her whenever.    
Later that night she calls me (never happens, only other time was to tell me to look at the moon.) She's crying and not being very coherent at all. I was asking her what's wrong, if she's safe. I can make out that she ""just has something going on"" and when I asked if I can come over (she lives maybe 8 minutes drive away with her parents) she said she'd rather I didn't because she doesn't feel safe with me driving.    
I got on my computer and posted a thread on 4chan about this situation (it's the most casual forum I could think of) and a few people suggested she has schizophrenia. I had never thought about this before but I guess it would explain it.    
I drove to her house anyway because I felt safe and that she needed me to be with her. I got there okay and as soon as I open the door I see her in full breakdown mode. She's crying and comes over to me and just hugs me for a bit. Her parents are on the couch. She goes and hugs her dad, and then goes to her aunt and uncles house next door (it's the other house on the property.)    
While she's gone I talk to her parents and find out they fully believe everything that she tells them (again I don't know what to think) and that the spirits are real and she has a ""gift"" she doesn't know how to control.    
Her uncle comes in with her and sits her down and starts talking to her about all this stuff, that's when I found out he's a hypnotherapist. Her father asked me to go to her room and get her incense, so I did, along with some sage and candles I found. He lights it up and starts saging the whole house.    
After I don't how long of all this stuff happening, she's calmer and able to go to bed. I go with her and tell her I'm sleeping on the outside side of the bed. This is because apparently the spirit pushed her out of bed the night before (and also brought her outside but I'm unsure if that was physically or some astral projection deal.)    
So now it's today and I'm back home and she's at work and I'm a little concerned/confused.    
    
TL;DR GF sees spirits, has a breakdown, whole family believes in spirits as well, I never have, don't know what to think or do.    
    
So here's where I'm at I guess: Is it possible she has schizophrenia? Either way I don't think I can bring that up to her or her family because they'd think I'm insensitive or shut off or something.    
I read a bit about it and I guess I should mention her room is usually super messy and she has a *terrible* memory. She also doesn't sleep very often, even though she needs it more than other people.

45,"I don't have delusion or any issues with movement but I do find my mind often time checks out while someone is talking and I used to think it might be some form of ADD but Adderall didn't help me. And now as I thought about it more today I realized a lot of the arguments I've gotten into with my wife are over some fictional prediction I've concocted of the worst case scenarios of what she might be doing. 

I've known her to drink or have dinner with friends behind my back, but I somehow escalate it in my mind instead of being realistic. She knows I get upset over being left out, but at the same time tend to hate social gatherings. Another thing that drives me nuts is when I immediately reply to a text of hers and she fails to respond. A reasonable person would realize she's probably busy but I start think it's some intentional attack on me. Like I'm somehow the center of the universe.

Then with my colleagues at work I often times think what they're talking about relates to me from pieces of conversations I overhear. I blamed it on past bullying but it's disturbing how often I feel like I'm the center of the universe and that the universe is trying to attack me.

Just wondering if this at all relates to Paranoid Schizophrenia. I've never thought it might be that before but I figured I'd ask. There are no family members with outright delusions in my family, but there is a lot of paranoia, fear, and mistrust of the outside world.

This might just be some undiagnosed aspergers or ocd issue, but I couldn't help but question this possibility. I also just discovered I have the T;T genotype of this:

47,"I’ve had a lot of problems that I’ve been experiencing and will give a long history to try to give the full picture. I have sought help but nothing seems to be helping. 

Current situation: I am a senior in college studying secondary education. I should be starting student teaching in about a week but I have put myself in a situation where that may not be possible. I failed one class last semester and several other classes gave me extensions to work through the holidays to complete work and be able to student teach. I have continually procrastinated to the point that I may not be able to finish in time. This would mean I would have to take an extra year to complete school because of how the classes/student teaching are scheduled and it is likely I would not be able to do this because of be out of eligibility for scholarships. Despite all of this, I am still apathetic.

Symptoms: As previously stated, I have an overwhelming sense of apathy that is likely the largest problem at the moment. I have an inability to control impulses, I will sit down to do work and after a few minutes go back to messing around on my phone or anything to distract me. Along with this, I have a seeming addiction to sexual release. I will have sex or masturbate at least twice a day and up to six times a day. I have issues with sleep, I often find myself unable to fall asleep until late (2 am or later). Even when I sleep a normal amount, I never feel rested. The temptation to lay down and rest or sleep is ever present. I have missed many responsibilities because of inability to get myself out of bed in the morning, or even as late as noon. I experience frequent headaches as well. 

Progression: I will try to trace a history of how this has progressed in the last several years to give a fuller picture. Up until college I experienced very few if any problems. I was a successful student and had many extra curriculars, maintaining a very busy schedule. Many days I would go to school all day and then work in a restaurant until 10 or 11 at night. I never had issues maintaining this schedule or being successful in whatever I was going. The only time I experienced anything even remotely similar to what I am currently going through in high school was a strange few day overreaction to an event. My best friend experienced a somewhat major (but not life changing) injury while I was present. After he went to the hospital and I was heading home, I began experiencing suicidal ideations, and the call of the void very strongly. I was extremely tempted to drive my car into a tree. I experienced these ideas and a severely altered mood for several days before returning to normal. I experienced a massive amount of change going into college that began my turmoil. My dog of 10+ years died shortly before I graduated high school. The day after graduation, my family moved away and I experienced a large amount of loneliness and anger the few months before college started. Upon starting college, a close friend died rather suddenly. I lost it upon hearing the news and was useless for a few days. Following this, I recovered somewhat and bottled up all the emotions I was experiencing. I proceeded to make it most of the way through my first semester before I had a breakdown. I broke down while working on a paper late at night, and went across the hall to a friends to talk. She helped calm me down that night and I finished the paper, but that night is the beginning of when I began to describe myself as depressed. This was my own term and I just decided that was what I was. As I finished that semester, I experienced personal problems but they did not affect me academically. The problems were severe enough that some friends notified the university and I was called in for a meeting with a counselor. I met with them a few times before the end of the semester and told them what happened and that I was depressed but they didn’t really do much. I finished that first semester with a 4.0 surprisingly but still had the personal issues. The next semester I still experienced the same problems but never returned to see the counselor. I ended up with all As and one B. That summer I once again did nothing and stayed at home with no friends, experiencing a lot of loneliness and anger. At the beginning of the next semester, I began a relationship that lasted a little over a year. That relationship helped me with many of my personal problems and I felt much better during the year. Both semester that year I continued to get mostly As with one or two Bs. The following summer was better because I had my gf to keep me company and I also worked. My gf and I broke up in October of my junior year. This sent me spiraling again and I experienced many personal problems and it started to affect me slightly academically. I did not drink before but I began drinking after that relationship. I told myself I only drank socially, which I did, but it was often to excess. At the end of the semester I had a lot of work left to do and not enough time to do it. I decided to not work at all on one classes’ assignment (a 20 page paper) and instead focus on all the others. I ended up getting all As except for that one class, which I failed. The following semester I began to date girl after girl, often with no break in between. My academics were suffering but not terribly yet. I ended the semester with mostly Bs. I also had a 3 month relationship that was very unhealthy and was primarily based on our sexual relationship. I ended that relationship that summer. That summer I worked a job and took a summer class online. I fell behind in the summer class to the point that the professor called me out on it. I managed to cram some work in at the end and pull off a C but it was a fairly undeserving C based on the amount of work I did. Fall of my senior year I started going back to the school counselor at the beginning of the semester because I knew my problems were getting out of hand. Despite knowing I needed help, I was reluctant to share all of my problems with the counselor for whatever reason. This led to ineffective treatment for a while. My academics began slipping and I told my counselor I wanted to try medicine. She put me on Prozac and I reacted very poorly to it. I became more depressed and missed over a week of classes before I came off the medicine. I was swapped to Effexor which has done little for me, I continue to take it and feel essentially the same as I did before I took anything. After that week of missed classes, I met with most of my professors and let them know kind of what was going on and they mostly worked with me, giving me extensions and such. Even with these extensions I found myself unable or unwilling to keep up with my work. At the end of the semester, I got one A (undeservingly in an easy A class), one F and 3 extensions. I have done almost no work through winter break to catch up and am now in crunch time where I must work, like I described at the beginning. 

I am at a loss of how to motivate myself to do any work or to care at all. I find the call of the void very compelling, part of me wants to drop out and just become a good for nothing drug addict, but I’m trying not to let that side win.

I’m sorry for the long winded post and if there is any clarification needed, please ask questions. I just need help. No one in my life knows the whole story. Very few even know parts. Most think I am still a successful student and getting along fine in life. I’m stuck and reaching out.",05Jan2018,1

How much do they cost per visit? My insurance requires me to pay out of pocket until the $2,700 deductible is met. I'd like some idea beforehand. 

I understand that it varies, but how often do people go on average? Once a week? Every other week?

I tried to ask my parents for advice/help or talking to them, because it's bothering me a lot, but they only kind of brush it off. 
Second thing is - like I said, I overthink things a lot..

55,"My dad refuses to admit that there is something wrong with him and declines getting him help. Sadly we can not force him to get help. I am looking for any help/advice/tips in regards to getting my dad help. This has been a long time coming and I am the only one who realizes he needs help and actually want him to get better rather than buying his bull and feeding his lies/addiction. There is so much more to explain, and so much more that I am leaving out, and I am sorry if I am all over the place.

TLDR My dad has had opioid addiction problems for 20 years and is miserable to be around. No one is interested in getting him actual help for his erratic/unnecessary behavior and are more concerned about the drama that he stirs up to create a smoke screen from the fact that he has problems. He has torn our family apart with lies and if something isn't done soon it is only going to get worse. 



My dad is literally Game of Thrones and starts drama, lies, and creates sides and wedges between the family. He is no fun to be around and literally just is a shell of himself. He used to be my idol and was so fun/funny. Now he just creates scenes in public and yells at millennials. He causes a scene and tries to get people(millenials) fired constantly. It's sad and sick. I've been the only person that didn't take sides since the drama he caused started, and tried my best to get him help. That fell on deaf ears. He drinks upwards of 3 5 hour energies a day.

He did all the top cancer drugs and everything(a dying dude had terrible cancer used to sell my dad his pills), also taking like 3 Xanax a day at 140 pounds or less(he looks like a skeleton now), all while drinking beer(which he stopped thank God, but the damage was done). That is when the dementia and him repeating himself got worse, that is also where I got the worst mental abuse as a 24 year old. Sometimes he will go in his room after he yells at us for two hours, and will literally yell for 10 hours. I am not exaggerating - he will do it a whole day. He never blames himself for anything.


I have been trying to get him help for the longest time, no one else will. He yells every day, belittles me and everyone who doesn't agree with even the tiniest point on his ""fox news"" agenda. He turns it into a full blown fight. He brings up the past constantly(usually ""poor me"" things that he created himself - literally the same stories since I've been born 31+ years). 

I am old enough to know and more than sick of this to just distance myself from the family(extended as well), since they don't want to support me and would rather say things / spread drama to bring me down / not step up and tell my dad he needs help. Me moving away is well under way. But I am wondering if there is literally anything that I can do to with someone that doesn't think anything is wrong with him?

---so more of the story---

A few years ago. He started calling the cops on me whenever he'd go extra insane. I would be asking him to stop yelling(usually at my mom) and eventually he'd belittle me and then push me and hit me. I'd overpower and restrain him, or push him away(I am much stronger now, he used to be a bad ass). That is when he would call the cops. He would literally lie and say he didn't touch me first and leave out every other detail.. Well anyways, that plan backfired on him. The cops came and so did the ambulance. We wanted to get him in the ambulance for a mental health evaluation, but he was so sure that he was fine and was so stubborn that he chose going with the cops and went to jail and not the ambulance. He called his other family and that is when the shit hit the fan.

He told his brothers and sisters(and parents who are still living) that we were always close with. Lied to them and they turned against us. I did my best to talk to my aunt and did salvage a lot since she never really realized how much of a liar and how fucked up he really was. I just told her the truth and it came pouring out the more she hung out with him. Still she won't back me up to get me help, but my recent bouts with researching and trying acid, I need an intervention.

My parents were apart for a good two years. We told my mom and dad to not get back together, but they eventually they reconciled. My little brother has still not talked to our dad and his relationship with the other family is almost nonexistent since this point. They used to hang out every weekend.



Now to recently, I have moved back home for a few months to save up money for my future. In that time my dad wakes up at 4:30am, yells on his phone at whoever will listen, causes drama, tells everyone I am a loser with no job(which I quit being what he was 10 years ago because it made him miserable and I didn't want to do it because I felt it was doing the same to me). He doesn't close the door while he yells on the phone and is loud so I hear him say things like that constantly. I then turn more fans on to drown out that noise and get a little more sleep. Then my mom gets up at 6. He proceeds to go up there and belittle her and yell loud as he can about the same things he's been yelling about for years. Finally we talked our mom in to moving out, which is great for her, except for the fact that my dad is now making my brother's life miserable. He is bringing my aunt back into the mix, and she does not get along with my mom any more, so now another shit show is well in tune. My older brother said that he will do all of the mediating and everything, and me and my other brothers are very competent. My aunt wants to be involved and maybe she thinks she's helping, but in my estimation it's going to make things worse. He is now planning on getting the same lawyer that took over 10k from him last time. He says he trusts my brother, but then says that he needs to protect himself. My mom only left because he is unbearable to be around. I also noticed he hasn't taken her out on a date ever, since I can remember.

My dad's biggest complaint is that my mom steals all his money. The problem is. My dad has spent so much money and bought so many new cars it's incredible(probably 7 including before he was like this). And every time he buys a new car he says he deserves it and more so that he's never had a new one. So in the last two years he's bought two new cars, 35k and 50+k. He gets $3000 every month from his disability pension and he spends it all, then lies and says my mom is robbing him and taking all his money. My mom does have investment accounts and literally doesn't buy anything, but stuff for the house. He is completely against getting a brain scan, his doctor has no idea what to do with him and just prescribes him pain meds(he does have back problems, but does not work out, stretch, or do anything to help it).

My question is are there any channels that I can take where I can actually get him help? How can we deal someone like this? How do we get him a brain scan? How do we get him a psychiatrist/therapist even-though he says he doesn't need one? I am getting myself out of the situation in a few months when I set myself up with some extra cash to buy a house and some other business stuff. The doctor he has doesn't know what to do, I am thinking that he should let him go and make my dad find another doctor.. He will have trouble, I am sure of it, he can't stay normal for long.

57,"im 32 years old and lately i have been thinking more and more about how much of a bad listener i am. with my wife im very ""in and out"" of the convo and miss a lot of stuff she says with others outside of my relationship im completely not listening. i also have a tendency to lash out at people i feel are threatening me or speaking badly about me. thinking before i speak isn't a strong point either. i dont have a lot of friends and i don't work. i have a lot of self hate as well. just kind of wondering what this stems from and if anyone else can relate. being very short would be happy to go into any specifics if anyone is curious",05Jan2018,2
58,"Sometimes I get this mental ""high"" that will come and go at the slightest sound, word, sight. I was walking in the park one day and it was 21 degrees outside - not a day for thinking it's beautiful outside. I look up at the trees and I get this overwhelming feeling of ecstatic happiness. I feel unstoppable and I realize I don't need those fake friends who say they care but their actions show otherwise. I feel like I am a creative genius, and I don't need anyone else in order for the world to realize I'm brilliant and beautiful and perfect - I already know I'm better than everyone else. I tell myself that I must DEMAND the best treatment from everyone, and they're not treating how I should be treated. I looked it up and I'm not sure if this feeling is euphoria (?).


The other piece of this is that at other times, I also feel an inexplicable rush of anger, hatred, jealously, and it feels like I'm restraining myself from lashing out and being extremely violent. Sometimes I'll look at myself in the mirror and I'll get this rush. Other times my little sister will do something silly, and I get the feeling, then I react in an extreme way. But I don't feel bad about feeling violent - it doesn't even feel like violence, it feels like something more romantic, like justice or retribution. Like whoever I'm feeling these feelings of digust for, they truly deserve it. It's either this gutwrenching hatred for other people or for myself. 


But, last night, I got this incredible feeling of self-hatred and loathing. Not unusual, but more extreme than the norm. Usually, I just feel sad and depressed, but everything started making sense - I am totally alone. God may still be there somewhere, but he doesn't know what I'm feeling. My friends have abandoned me after I asked for fair treatment. My family is broken. I can't even organize your thoughts or decide how I feel about anything. My mind is a mess and even during the good periods, it feels like it's going to explode. I began harming myself, something I hadn't done since about freshman year, but this time I drew blood. I knew I shouldn't have done it, but I had nothing else to do.


I'm writing on here now because I have nowhere to turn. I don't think it's hormones, because usually I know the difference. Between the highs and lows, my brain feels crowded and about to burst, and sometimes I can barely think straight because I can't decide between anything. I alternate between two extremes and I don't know where my mind is. I think this condition is interfering with my friendships, I think it caused me to break up with my first boyfriend. I don't know what's wrong with me or how to fix it. I just want to feel like a normal teenager, with normal interests and problems. Is it all in my head? I have no clue. I just want it all to stop.
