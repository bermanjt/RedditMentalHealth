0,"I’ve had some eating problems for the past 2-3 years.

My mother used to tell me that I ate too much, and she would put me on whatever restrictive, fad diets that she would go on. That led to a lot of binging and secretive eating. I became obese at 200 pounds.

Then I started restricting, and got down to 158 pounds. I was suffering horribly from depression, and went inpatient. They diagnosed me with MDD and Body dysmorphia. I wanted to be healthier, so I ate normally and got back to 195 pounds. I hated myself, so I began restricting again and exercising.

I’m 172 pounds now, still clinically obese, but I’ve been having so many problems with eating. I can’t bring myself to eat now, I feel like I’m going to gain weight if I eat the smallest amount. I ate 190 calories today and I still feel guilty.

I don’t know what to do. I’m obese so I feel like I don’t truly have an eating problem. No one would take a fat person seriously about an eating disorder. ",20Mar2018,1,

4,"I know this may be a silly little thing, and I know it’s only social media but I just wanted to see if some people feel the same.

I have depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and an inferiority complex so I may react to things differently than others.

Somebody that I knew at school unfollowed me on Instagram today, right enough I wasn’t really close to them, but I’d spoken to them quite a lot and they signed my yearbook, then out of the blue they unfollowed me. We seemed to like each other and be well acquainted. 

When I saw that they had, it just felt so so painful, like I’d had my heart ripped out of my body, I started wondering what I’d done wrong, what was wrong with me, started thinking they didn’t like me anymore for whatever reason. I felt like I’d been shunned and told to fuck off. 

I know people might think this is silly but I genuinely want to know if others feel the same if it’s happened to them. Like I said, it’s only social media at the end of the day.

5,"For as long as I can remember, my mother has exhibited strange behavior. She is very high functioning, intelligent, and well educated. But at the same time she's suffering. She was officially diagnosed with delusional disorder by a court appointed psychiatrist during a custody battle in 2000, yet the courts sided with my mom and left my sister and me in her care.

There are multiple subtypes of delusional disorder, and she has exhibited all of them at some point in her life. But her disorder is mostly the erotomanic subtype. She convinces herself that wealthy men in her area, such as doctors and local business owners, are in love with her. When we were kids, she would ask repeatedly if so-and-so ever talked about her, and she would not stop until we played along. She would then use that as justification to begin stalking the men she believed were in love with her. Her longest recurring stalking victim was the doctor who performed my grandmother's hysterectomy in 1985, and in the 90's her antics (including love letters and showing up at his office unannounced) culminated in him threatening legal action. She moved on to other victims in the meantime, but she recently became obsessed with him again.

And as for other examples of her behavior: she has claimed to be a princess; she always insisted my dad cheated on her when they were together; she would claim little clicks on the telephone were proof of a government wiretap; and she has even claimed to be dying of cancer to win an argument.

She is dying of cancer, for real this time, but it took me a long time to accept her diagnosis because I initially thought it was a desperate plea to get me back in her life.

I moved to another state to get away from her controlling behavior, which has helped my own mental health and emotional development. But I will admit, it can be hard knowing my mother is suffering alone in another state. We still talk on the phone periodically, which mostly consists of her ranting about all sorts of things while I nod along. She hates the rest of her family, so she lives alone in a filthy apartment full of all of our childhood stuffed animals and photographs. I know the chance of her dying alone is really high, but I am at peace knowing all of her pain (physical and emotional) will end soon. This has been going on for over 30 years, and she has refused help every step of the way. I just hope the end is peaceful for her.",20Mar2018,11,

7,"Not sure how to start, but I'm a 25/m Fil-Am living in Hawaii. I've never seen a doctor to have been diagnosed, but I've had constant bouts of suicidal/depressing thoughts since high school. Most days I would generally be okay and feeling happy, but then I would have moments where I would hyperventilate or cry without reason, then I would be overcome with a feeling of numbness. I really wouldn't know what to do and didn't have anyone to confide these feelings in. Even now, when I try to talk to my friends about feeling sad or having negative thoughts, they usually respond with memes. That or they don't seem to care much at all. And a few years ago, I brought it up once with a family member that I was close with and they gave me the ""You have this, this, and this. Why are you feeling suicidal/depressed?"" response, so I've never confided in any family member since.

It's progressively gotten worse over the past year. While preparing to apply to grad school (Dec 2016), my grandmother became ill and had to receive surgery. This resulted in her now only having one lung. After recovering at the hospital and going through PT, she moved in with my auntie (Mar 2017), then I followed and became her primary caregiver, as well as taking up her duties at home (I originally live with my grandma and grandpa). At first, I did everything out of love, but now it just feels like I'm doing it out of expectation as the oldest grandchild. Going back forth between two houses and taking care of both my grandma and grandpa has been an emotionally and mentally draining experience for me. It doesn't help that on some days I get really bad and just want to isolate myself from the world, but I can't take any off days to recoup and become good again. It's gotten to the point where I catch myself thinking ""I hate it here"" and then that urge to disappear for good.

Some ways I use to cope with my depression and suicidal thoughts are reading/writing, church, and PC gaming. In those moments, I'm really happy, but when I'm not keeping my hands or mind busy I fall into this rut and feel numb all over again. Like I said, it's just gotten worse over the past year and I'm really not sure what to do or who to turn to. Any advice or words are greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",20Mar2018,1,

9,"So I’ve struggled with Anxiety and depression all my life, these illness’s cripple me day to day and really effect my schooling. I’ve missed 40 days in 2 months and the number just keeps adding up. 

Some of the struggles I face at school are panic attacks, overwhelming stress, and fear. I try to leave my classes 5 mins early so I don’t have to face anyone in the hallways, and when I can’t I never look up at anyone. I also have zero friends and that makes it all a lot harder. I struggle with trying to hold back tears in every class, and constantly have to sit in a separate quiet room during class to regroup and calm myself down. On top of that I struggle to find meaning in my schooling, I know I won’t be taking post-secondary and I know I want to have a calm, go with the flow life. I feel very lost. 

I feel like the society puts too much pressure and stress on people and that’s something I know I don’t want to be apart of and something I will not be able to be apart of. My meaning in life has nothing to do with success or my job or education, there’s so much more than that for us.

13,"My mom passed away in Nov of 2017. It was an incredibly hard yet somehow amazing four day experience watching and (maybe) helping her pass. She’s no longer in pain, she’s at peace. While you all might not share my belief in the afterlife, I strongly believe I’ll see her again and it brings me comfort. 

I experienced a lot of pain and emotion. But this post isn’t about me. 

It’s been 3 1/2 months since she passed and my dad is a wreck. While I’m starting to believe he wasn’t very emotionally healthy before she died, my dad has been a wreck as I said. He’s alone in the large house where my mom passed. He doesn’t have any close friends, emotionally or geographically. He has no hobbies. His only activity over the past seven years has been caring for my mom as she got better, worse, better, worse, worse, worse, etc. 

He’s seen a therapist and been going to a gym for a bit but he’s very inconsistent. He calls and majorly breaks down several times a month to me and my sisters. 

I so desperately want to help him but I’m struggling. I have a very time consuming / high stress job and two sons under three. I barely have time to talk with my wife in the evenings. It’s a lot. 

I don’t mean to sound like a shit-son. I hope I don’t. But I also feel like my attempts to listen and counsel to my dad are useless. I’m almost considering an intervention style approach - direct and to the point. He needs help and I think he needs the professional medical type. And meds. 

My mom was a wonderful person with a huge heart. She kept my dad going for a long time and now has left even bigger shoes to fill. 

This feels like a ramble and I hope I don’t come off anything but loving and concerned. 

I welcome all thoughts and ideas. Thanks and peace to all. ",20Mar2018,3,

https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7rfccf/thinking_death_is_my_only_option/

https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7wqlpb/suicide_thoughts_getting_stronger/

Because this is more of a mental crisis, I thought I'd post here instead this time.

Over the years I have become almost totally isolated from people. Only have seen a few friends, who don't really know my issues &amp; I'm usually nervous as all hell in front of them. Seen someone yesterday for the first time in ages, worked with him many times but trying to drink a coffee while we caught up for a chat was pretty much impossible. I'm not sure if he noticed.

If I see any of my extended family, who know really nothing of my life, I'm the same nervous wreck. I've only really become somewhat alright around immediate family but the ones who know the most, what I have told them I feel has ruined the relationship I have with them. And I'm always taking my teddy bear with me to help me stay calm.

My main problem is I can't be social, part of society, being who I am. Like work or volunteering, going out to events, even if just with extended family or simply going for a walk, especially when there's heaps of people around. I can't do it. I have so much hatred for my sexual problems &amp; I'm so scared that if people find out those things about me, there'll be a mass exodus or worse, someone will harm me, even though I haven't, won't &amp; never want to hurt anyone.

Coupled with the fact I'm transgender &amp; a little/middle (ABDL) &amp; I've even to started accept myself in that regard but there's nothing I can do to change. The only way I believe I'll be able to take estrogen is going DIY. I can't find anyone who'll see me professionally &amp; I can't afford to pay hundreds to 1000's of dollars per month just to see someone privately, who'll most likely gate keep me because of how messed up I am. And I know I can never be the young girl who I feel I am (not to mention the delusional standpoint). No one will help me there &amp; understandably.

Plus how bad I feel being on disability as well as in community housing when I see so many others not being helped, some with really horrible mental &amp; physical problems. I don't feel worthy of having this opportunity.

But I know I can't keep existing like this. Something has to change. It's why I've accepted many things about myself &amp; I'm doing what I can to become how I want to be. But there'll always be my sexual problems which I can never escape from. And every time I think about how I'm going to deal with them, suicide seems the only answer. I'm not a risk of hurting anyone, like I've said in previous posts, I been through abuse &amp; honestly, I'd rather kill myself than place that burden &amp; harm onto someone else.

18,"Long story short, a while ago I was in a really bad place mentally (my depression was a lot worse than usual and my anxiety was through the roof for no apparent reason), and I was a kind of shitty friend to the only people I was really close with.

I want to be able to explain that I was in a really bad place, and therefore wasn't the best person I can be, but not come off as trying to ""get away with it"" if that makes sense? I'm just really afraid that I won't sound sincere or I'll come off as guilt-trippy.

Another trigger is social interaction, I am trying to fight this by talking to more people like on here and have started a tinder to try and talk to more strangers, again it's difficult especially when people unmatch but it's working on my appearance and interaction triggers so I am trying to keep it up.

26,"Hi guys, I'm looking for a bit of encouragement and advice. I'm 20 years old and have recently moved out of home to a new city (Brisbane, AU) over 1000 km away. I've struggled with anxiety since I was about 11 years old and haven't really taken the initiative to get help until now. I spoke to my mum back when I'd just turned 16 about how I was feeling and at the time I was on birth control and she blamed it on that so I went to a doctor and they changed my medication and referred me to a psychologist who was absolutely horrible at her job. I had 6 free sessions with her and by the end I knew more about her than she did about me and told my mum that it was likely I had anxiety but couldn't be sure as she ""didn't really understand teenagers"". 

&amp;nbsp;

My mum, who worked in allied health at the time, told me she'd speak to a colleague that was a psychologist, but it never ended up happening and I wasn't really comfortable speaking to someone my mum knew anyway. I went to a different doctor (father's doctor) with my mum again about my birth control and he brought up the fact that I'd gone to a psychologist and gave me a pamphlet for an anti depressant and asked if I'd be interested in trying it. My mum immediately said no and dismissed me trying any anti depressants as she said it would majorly mess with my brain. She also didn't want me to be on medication or diagnosed with anxiety because it would show up on my mental health record.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been okay for the past year as I took a break from uni, but have now started again and can see I'm already coming back to how I used to be (not able to concentrate on anything for more than 20 minutes, procrastination, easily irritable, panic attacks). I worked up the courage to make an appointment by myself for a new GP next week to discuss things but I'm extremely nervous and worried that I'm making a big deal out of nothing and that maybe I'm just being lazy and that I know a lot of other people have it far worse off than I do so I shouldn't be wasting time like this. 

&amp;nbsp;

I know I'm just being stupid and that I should go anyway to discuss how I feel with a doctor but I can't help but feel that way. If anyone has any tips on seeing a doctor about this for the first time it would be very much appreciated as I'd like to have somewhat of a guide or else I'll probably just start crying from confrontation haha.

28,"So I'll try to keep myself short, feel free to ask me questions if you'd like to know something more.

In the past I did analytical psychotherapy because it was recommended to me by our school's counsellor (they don't have the capacity to offer more than 5 sessions per student). I sought treatment for social anxiety, but also depression and dissociation. If anything this therapy has made me feel like the issues I just mentioned are actually just symptoms of a bigger problem, e.g. if my social anxiety becomes a bit more manageable my depression will become worse. I quit therapy due to multiple circumstances, so I don't know what my therapist would have said to that. (But often she would find very simple explanations, like I'm depressed because I work too much.)

Now after a long time of reading around (I don't want to promote self-diagnosis, this might end up being wrong) I realize I'd certainly meet the diagnostic criteria for both AvPD and OCPD. Thinking back to my past therapy a lot of it was focused on the common symptoms of OCPD so I guess my therapist might have silently diagnosed me with OCPD or it being the predominant PD idk.

No matter what it is, it causes me to not have a social life. I will always be aware that I have zero social skills when dealing with people and belive I do/did everything wrong that is/was possible, if there is a reaction to wait for I will go desperate because obviously it will turn out that I did something ridiculous rude. The ""obssesive"" part is also manifesting in a different way in my love life where I essentially end up fidning someone I like and then end up obsessing for months-years. (Of course nothing comes from that, but I can't really quit it the pain of abandonment becomes so strong I become suicidal whenever I try.) If my past life was made shit by other people, these days it's mostly these issues, and I really don't want to have to spend my whole life like that. Also the anxiety is interfering with my professional life in a drastic way which also sucks, when your only successful way to cope is have a 60-70h work week. (I'm still a student btw.)

Does anyone have any recommendation what kind of treatment to seek out? I'm not sure if I will be able to get back to therapy sessions this year, so self-help strategies would also help a lot too. Are (these specific) personality disorders even treatable? ",20Mar2018,1,

This issue is BB later talked to my wife and shared the fact he finds my inability to function in those situations as bothersome. His view is that despite his physical disability, the fact that he can go out and do things means that I should have no excuse.

37,"Bad things have been happening to me... throughout most of my life. That sentence is an understatement. I feel that I'm finally at a breaking point. I am only 36 years old. 

Timeline of Bad Things:

- When I was born - I almost died. I was in the hospital for weeks before I was able to be taken home. There were antibodies from my mother's blood attacking my blood cells. That's pretty much what happened. It shuts down most of the baby's organs.

- Once I arrived home and began my... life... I spent the first decade or so of my developmental years in a house filled with screaming, physical fights, threats of violence, chronic fear of being attacked/hurt. It was a nightmare. It was mostly my dad. He came from an abused childhood and all of that trickled down into my childhood. The house was also filled with cigarette smoke 24/7, so I've developed into a person with chronic ear/nose/throat problems, a poor immune system, and scarring throughout my ears and mastoid process (that showed up on an MRI in my 20's). 

- season the ongoing years with being bullied at school, not fitting in, being a weird, awkward kid...

- At the age of 15, one of my two older brothers died of brain cancer. 

- At the age of 21, my parents moved out of state. I stayed behind and finished college. I pretty much struggled without parental support, but that was my choice in that instance. But I never really ""made it"" into a successful career. I spent most of my 20's just trying to keep bills paid - I didn't have time or energy to quit work and chase whatever dream career I might have had. 

- At the age of 23 I got married to my boyfriend which was a very stupid decision. At the age of 26, I later divorced him after discovering that he was cheating on me. I did remarry someone else at the age of 30.

- At the age of 32, my mother died of colon cancer. 

- At the age of 33, my (second) husband lost his job and admitted he had spent all of our savings in secret. We were broke for some time. We lost our home. We did get couples therapy, build back up our savings, and now have a new home. A lot of scars were leftover from that. Lots of trauma and fear too. 

- Two years ago, my current husband was almost killed in a car accident. He was not at fault. An elderly man crashed head-on into him. My husband was luckily spared. It was traumatic. We lost a new car, too. 

- Two years ago, not long after the car crash, some men opened fire outside of my house, shooting at the front porch. It was some drug/gang related stuff - they were aiming at the neighbors apparently. Wasn't a bad neighborhood either - it can happen anywhere, but it sent my anxiety through the roof and I became terrified of that neighborhood. I had to go on anxiety meds and tranquilizers. We eventually moved. 

- Last august, at my current age (36), my father (in spite of all our differences) died of congestive heart failure. He died unexpectedly. He refused to take his medication (which kept him alive), said he was ""cursed"" because he lost my mother, and died by his own volition. In essence, my father killed himself. 

- As of this January, my doctor discovered a large tumor growing out of the back of my uterus. There was some question as to whether or not it was cancer. Luckily it turned out to be benign, but I lost my uterus - I am still in recovery, which has proven to be extremely painful (and draining on the bank account since I cannot work). 

By this point in my life, I am very depressed and still battling anxiety. I am not even that old. I do not feel like I genetically inherited any mental illness. I believe the state of my life has introduced these issues for me. 

I have gone to therapists throughout my life. They've been terrible. I have had so many bad experiences with them, it's like just another example of my bad luck. I've had therapists cancel on me, cut sessions early after 20 minutes, and insist that I don't even need therapy. 

I feel like I'm slowly becoming dead inside to everything. ",20Mar2018,0,

I'm almost 23 now. It seems the fatigue started after emotional trauma when I was 16. At first, I thought I just needed to rest, but rest didn't help at all.

I suppressed my fatigue for a while, and I thought I was happy. But then, one day, some sort of black cloud appeared over me. It was like a darkness forming in my mind. I experienced brain fog, I had trouble thinking. I remember that I was at school, and I just couldn't stand the sitting; there was some sort of deep discomfort inside of me, and it was making me restless.

After I started getting physical symptoms, I was medicated to an extent. The physical symptoms left.

I had a couple of bad fall ins and outs with the meds they were giving me. That made everything a thousand times worse.

Now, I'm on 6mg of bromazepam, 2.5mg of lorazepam; both are tranquilizers to stop the physical symptoms from withdrawal from happening. Then, I have ziprasidone 40mg, which leaves me restless, and I'm deeply afraid of a medication change, now that I know what they can do to you physically and mentally. Sertraline 50mg, which actually helps me get things done. And, for some reason, fluanxol 1mg.

I can't stand still, but I can lay down still. My thoughts are restless during meditation. I never have any mental energy to get my work and studies done.

I think something happened to me. I think it could have been the emotional trauma, or it could have been that I meditated too much, and I freaked out, but the fatigue was there before the incident with meditation.

People have been suggesting me that I try magic mushrooms or LSD. But I don't think they understand my mental disorder, all they know, as do the doctors, the symptom of depression.

Depression and anxiety are symptoms. They're not illnesses. They merely mean you're showing that symptom. And it makes my hope dwindle for a treatment, as we're stuck in this symptom-treating paradigm.

I have thoughts that my consciousness is somehow broken, but I can't tell you why. Sometimes, I think about suicide, and it makes me relax, and I'm only running away from my mind not the world.

I think my mind is the only thing that I've cared for for a long time. I don't build relationships, I don't worry about work, I just look for the next best thing that could fix me, and that might just turn out to be an illegal drug at some point or some dangerous therapy. I've stopped caring about danger, as I've lost all hope.",20Mar2018,2,
41,"Hi all 

Recently I’ve been really struggling with my mental health in ways I can’t explain. I’m seeing a therapist but we’ve only had one meeting so I have no clear advice or answers to what’s wrong yet. Last night in bed I felt like I had no control over my body and was constantly twitching and convulsing. Woke up sore and with the same twitching, had to miss school. Mom is confused, trying to be understanding, and somewhat angry. My two questions are: have any of you felt like you lost control of your bodies? How do I explain a mental health issue I’m not understanding to my mom?

I cant take this anymore, its so fucking hard. Everything is falling apart. Nothing is going right. Im fat, I have bad grades,
Im bullied, I have mental disorders, I have no friends, im single and the list just goes on and on.

48,"Growing up I’ve always looked up to my older brother who is good at everything he does. I’ve followed the same path as him, but last year I joined culinary school instead of some prestigious high school. I am great at cooking but because of anxiety and setting sky high expectations to myself I couldn’t handle the stress of working in a fine dining kitchen. I am seeing the school psychiatrist. We tried to figure out what it is and turns out I have a habit of having to be the best at everything I do. This makes me stress about everything because I have to meet my own unrealistic expectations. I don’t want to disappoint others, if its my parents, teachers, gf or friends.



It is cowardly, but I feel like I have to be perfect with everything I do. If there is something I am not good at I just stay away from it to not expose my weakness, and if there Is something I have/want to do I enjoy getting better and performing as good as I can.  I strive to be nice to everyone, and make others life as good as possible, but I realise that I have to fix this for my own sake because it makes everyday situations hard to deal with because I think of everything as a task or a challenge. 



 I have gotten a gf who I truly love and trust, and we talk about everything that stresses us etc. Because of this performance anxiety I just can’t get hard at the most annoying times. My gf is understanding about it but this to me was a sign that I have to do something.

Things have just gotten worse, she spent years accusing me as a teenager to be on “drugs” or making sure I didn’t go certain places to phone calls at 3am from mothers intuition and I just thought mum was being a little over protective. 

After years on her own, she is agitated daily, cursing at random people, changing pin codes weekly, accusing radio/tv/celebrity people of conspiring against her etc

I asked if she would go to the hospital, she replied “sure there is nothing wrong with me and when I’m let out you need to help me catch them”

She was diagnosed and kept for 3 weeks, she hated me for this thinking they got to the doctors and that’s the real reason why she has been kept inside. After 2 weeks on medication she got better, still angry but much more lucid in her conversations. 

After her release she stopped taking the medications because she was gaining a little weight and never went to the psychologist. 

2 years on, its much worse but not sure what I can do. I live internationally but when I come back I just get abused. 

I just want to help her, but the hospital says they can only take her if she admits there is somthing wrong with her, which she avidly defends. 

She has ostracised herself from her friends accusing them of conspiracy, she lost her job for same reasons

58,"Hi. I don't if I'm a brat, or just thinking too much about this, but I think that something might be ""off"" with me. 
When I was a child, around 8 years old, this thought that 'people were watching me' appeared. It was nothing, it was just a thought. Than, later, maybe when I was 11, it came back but with a strange feeling. And a camera in my eyes. Well, not exactly a camera, but a device that would let certain people see what I see. I was embarassed to even live. But I managed to shake it off of my mind. I am 16 now, and I still have it-that thought and feeling like everybody is watching me and know my actions, but it kind of developed recently. Now everybody knows my actions, literally everyone, but only I don't know that they know cause I'm not able to see that device that shows it to them. It is kind of hard to explain.
I have mood swings and feel like there are 2 sides fighting inside of me. Like the other day, my mind was so messed up I felt like screaming in the middle of the street. I had a thought, and then another one shitting all over it, then the first one but improved, and then the another one...and this all is happening in seconds..I felt like one of them won (for a couple of hours). But usually it's not as distressing as thia, just two sides constantly fighting and leaving me confused.
When I'm in a social situation I sometimes think that people can read my mind if they're touching me. Or just can read my mind.
These ""feelings"" last maybe half a minute, and I can shake them off of my mind. They appear a couple of dozen times a day so it is sometimes frustrating. And I know they're irrational.
Oh and I daydream waaaay too much. I don't know how many worlds I've got going on there. There's this weird thing that I started doing when I was, well, a child. I just listen to music and walk (fastly) in circles in my room for hours and just think about situations that will never happen.

There are more weird things from my childhood, but this post is way too long even without them.

63,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here goes anyhow.
Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Sorry for the wall of text in advance, but I need to get this off my chest.

I've been bullied most of my life (currently 17 years old). It started right when I first began going to school and was everything from verbal abuse to people punching me and trying to choke me. I hate to admit it but I think at some point all of this shit got to me, and when I started at a new school in 7th grade (where physical bullying wasn't as big of an issue) I didn't really know how to interact socially. My efforts at the time to have any friends quickly fell apart, and once again I found myself being ""that kid that nobody talks to"". Up to 7th grade I had felt like crap every time I went to school so I kind of convinced myself that I didn't need any friends and isolated myself completely. 

Three years after that, in 9th grade, I worked my ass off to get good enough grades so I could keep going to the same school when I had to start highschool (since the teachers were pretty awesome). Basically at this point I hadn't really made any friends and had spent the three past years doing nothing but studying. I did at one point hang out with a guy who was the same age as me but went in a different class (we'll call him John). In a nutshell, John seemed nice on the surface but was an asshole underneath, who knew how to manipulate people, and my ""friendship"" with him after a while turned out to be the last kind of friendship you would want (but that's a different story all together). So I was pretty happy at the end of 9th grade, I though to myself that I would finally meet new people in highschool, socialize and have fun (oh boy was I wrong). 

Turns out that many of the people in my class decided to continue highschool at the same school, and since they knew that I had been a loner for three years and had both made fun of me and spread all kinds of rumors, (I know this for a fact) it basically gave them the opportunity to tell everyone what a ""weird"" kid I was. I know that they in some shape or form did this, because from 7th grade through 9th grade a trend had formed where people would call me by my last name, which I fucking hated and still do because it feels so patronizing and diminishing. This carried on in highschool thanks to them, despite me making it obvious on more than once occasion that I do not appreciate it at all. 

So there I was again, I had been alone for three years, and it was like that again. I'd again become the guy who sits alone in classes, sits alone at lunch and who nobody knows anything about but who everyone chooses to ignore. 

Fast forward to today, I'm 17, and nothing has changed. I'm going to graduate from highschool in about three months, yet I feel more depressed than ever.
You see, on top of all of the bullying and me being ignored, the final blow really has been the lack of self esteem that all of this shit has caused. I've got problems with acne, which makes things a lot fucking worse. To give you a picture of what I look like physically, I'm 6' tall and weigh roughly 65 kilos. That's basically on the verge of being underweight for my height. I guess it wouldn't be so bad today if somebody had just once told me that they cared, if I had at some point had a close friend with whom I could talk. Because all of this crap has been piling up for years and years and years, it's finally gotten to me. I can't even stand to look at myself in the mirror, because I just keep telling myself that I'm not even good enough to be worthy of a friend. On the rare occasion that anyone talks to me at school they do it in a way, and a tone, that makes it seem like I'm completely freaking insane. I don't know if they would even care if I told them how much it hurts. 

The worst part about all of this is probably the fact that all of my final exams are coming up, and that I can feel myself falling apart. I've worked to hard through highschool to get good grades and have a future, and right now when I should be the happiest I've ever been I can't help to think to myself that nothing will change. I'm afraid that at university, even if it's all new people, they'll still see me as an acne-ridden monstrosity, no matter how hard I try. I'm pretty sure I don't appear to look as physically bad as I keep telling myself I do, but it's hard to stay positive when my self image has been corrupted by years of being alone, and thinking to myself that nobody would ever give a damn about me. 

The only thing I can think about is how badly I want a social life, I want friends, a girlfriend, but I feel like all of these things are far out of my reach, and I feel like nothing I do will change this. At this point I'm not sure how much of me will be left mentally if I can't make a change soon.


tl;dr: Got bullied verbally and physically when I was young, this most likely messed with my social skills and resulted in me never making any friends and always being on my own. Now it's finally gotten to me.

Sometimes it feels like love is supposed to feel. Sometimes I feel so indifferent and numb towards him that I think it's just my mental illness telling me to find someone to cling to.

I don't even know what is me and what is my disorder anymore. Is it any trace of me left anymore? If I kill this disorder does it mean I'll be killing myself too?

All of a sudden the ""normal"" stuff in life doesn't give me satisfaction and I have the urge to do something extreme to stand out and make a point. (i.e. suddenly moving abroad to work when I might not be ready for that just yet). 

I am chopping and changing ideas every week and I wouldn't say they are totally unrealistic, but they are considerably harder to achieve with much higher risks involved. I throw myself into the deep end! Then I am in this cycle that I get overly stressed and upset that I am not able to do it. I then spend days getting all depressed wondering what my purpose is in life and why I can't manage certain things. I have this big to-do list/bucket list of things I want to do one day - some I have already started, but will finish when my emotions calm down and I stop getting overly worked up about it. My emotions take such control they have both physical and mental effect on me. I am creating my own stress hoping I will get good out of the situation.

I am really worried that I am not able to become the person I want to be and actually working towards that seems to be dragging me down like my goals are too high and far-fetched. In wanting to be happy within myself and make my family proud, I feel I am actually going backwards by putting all this pressure onto myself.

68,"Ive had a long time childhood friend. Let's call him Sam. Sam, myself, and my twin grew up together from 7th/6th grade onwards. Sam is one year younger then me but was always a very outgoing and fun guy.

After highschool, me and my twin moved a few hours away for college. It didn't work out. The year after we moved back into town,  Sam graduated highschool and then went to the same college we had just left. It also, didn't work out. By the time Sam had moved back home from college. Me and twin (I'll refer to us as us/we from here forward until it's obvious we seperate a bit), had already gotten jobs together and had an apartment. Sam lived at home for maybe half a year and ended up moving in with someone to have a roommate townhouse dealio.

Here is where it gets confusing.

We still kept contact with Sam over the next 2 years but he was doing his own thing and we were doing ours. Life was continuing and that is where that chapter ends. 
Sam did not end there. Turns out he had been having issues. It was odd things at first. Side comments, unable to hold any job for more than a few weeks, distance from his parents. We werent sure what to make of it. Tried to help (offer support, let him come out with us, crash on a couch, etc...). We tried what we could to be there for him.

But we had no clue. No family members or even himself could/would tell us what was going on. We heard he had seen a shrink for a bit. They had ""diagnosed"" him as schizophrenic. They had ""diagnosed"" him as bipolar. They had ""diagnosed"" him with depression, insomnia, and anything under the sun. We could not get a clear answer of what it was going on.

My twin through the years, tried to help. More than I could have. Took him in on 2 seperate occasions. Sam lived with him for about 2 months each time. Twin tried to help him get a job, get on his feet, just sort of be self sufficient. It didn't work out. Nothing worked out there. Sam was in his own world, and simply unable to do things that every adult has to do to survive. So Sam went back to living with his parents.

That was the trend, he'd be there but always complained how they didn't understand him. And he hated that he had to live there. But he never did anything for himself to make his situation better. It's always beetn a confusing situation for us. Like, we want to help, but how if the person you're trying to help is unable to help themselves. Ive let him come over, through the years, and we'd hang, have a good, (sad/depressing), kind of time. Id offer a couch to crash but you couldnt do more than that with Sam. Hed take it upon himself to stay for a week. I cant have that in my life anymore. Im married with a 4 year old. Life aint as easy as having a confused longtime friend stay at your place for a week.

So this all continued for now almost 10 years.(time frames above kind of elapse at the end of that 10yrs.)

And here we are. My twin just texted me saying Sam has messaged him saying these days he lives on the streets. His parents probably could have done better in helping when all this stuff first started. But they didnt. And i can't not help Sam. So i need help to help him.

Sorry this is so long winded but I dont think just bullet pointing makes a lot of sense here for us. What can we do. How do we find resources to get him the help he needs. Any treatment programs, hospice care, buddy system? I dunno. I just can't be ok sitting in my happy life knowing that there is nothing I can do. What I have, i don't think I can help.
