1,"My dad has paid for a lot of stuff over my life. He is currently paying for my therapy sessions, as they are expensive. But while paying for things, he holds it against me, talks down to me, threatens me, curses at me, name calls. When I try to tell him how I feel, he gives me even more. He is bi-polar (took himself off medication twice) and I am clinically depressed (on medication).

Today, after 28 years, I just popped. I said ""I dont fucking want him paying for shit if it comes with strings every time. I dont want to be bullied. I'll figure out my finances and take control."" And we were at a restaurant and I just didnt wanna be there. I requested an Uber, and when it pulled up, I slammed my hand on the table and said ""Go back on your fucking meds. Sometimes I really wish you were dead."" 

Now I have mixed feelings. On the one hand I am glad I told my dad EXACTLY what I was thinking/feeling...despite how dark it was. But the fact I cannot afford certain things without his help, it scares me. 

Thanks for all input.",14Jun2018,3,
2,"Hey reddit

So my psychitrist put me on my first mood stabilizer and after one dose I am experiencing really bad side effects; feeling of vertigo, dizziness, loss of balance, nausea, mental fog, and extreme fatigue. I have two toddlers and a full time job so I am not functioning right now. I called my psychiatrsit and left a msg and haven't heard back. I took the pill Monday night, it's Wednesday evening and I'm still feeling extreme effects. I'm barely functioning. What can i do to speed up getting this stuff out of my system? Please tell me there is something because I feel like I'm on a really bad trip and never coming out of it. Thanks",14Jun2018,3,

why the hell am I here and why do i want to die all the time?? i just want an answer and ive been googling for a while even though i know it will never give me what i need. i know this wont help me either but i just need something.

some context

I have a therapist and i talk to her every other week, which i enjoy. i went to a psychiatrist (sorry spelling isnt important to me right now) and i got absolutely nothing. i was recommended to go by my therapist because she suspected psychosis and depression. i. got. nothing.

The professional acted annoyed that i was even there because i didnt have it as worse as other people due to me having good grades and participating in school. He seemed to ignore my mentioning of thoughts about suicide and constant dreams about watching myself die. it seems like no matter where i go or who i go to or what about whats going on i tell them, i dont get any sort of help. this may be just me being an entitled 1st worlder who makes a mountain out of a mole hill but its driving me nuts. i just want these thoughts to go away and i dont want it to be a process, my process has taken long enough.  why am i here and why do i hate it so much? someone please help.",14Jun2018,1,

              A glisp into a colorless world

A depressed soul has no reason to be ashamed just because our world is often grey, we try to bring color to those around us who stay.
While others get up and start their day, we get up and just wish we could hide away and dream of a day that we don't feel this way.
To some that day may never come but we still try all the same. 
While our smiles may often be forced they are hardly faked, for just one smile might keep our demons at bay.
We can be the life of the party, always laughing and often getting carried away, we do this so others might not feel the same way.
We know what it's like to hurt, its a feeling we feel from the time we get up till the time we go to sleep; and sometimes even in our dreams we get little escape. 
Some might say we are fake, but it's not that way. We want to make others happy we want to make others laugh and even love. We do this in the hope that they may never feel the same
So never say we are weak cause we often want to give up. Never say get over it, for if we could we would. 
Our love is often deep and unconditional others just have to help to bring color to our dark colorless world. 
So laugh with us and love with us, but most of all let us help you to never feel the darkness we carry each and everyday. ",14Jun2018,8,

6,"I've known this girl for almost a month now. I'll call her Ktea. We met online. On a random discord server.  
We've been very open towards each other. We have a lot of very odd similar interests. At first we thought we just liked the same genres, but then it turns out almost EVERY single specific song I liked, she did also. There were a large amount of similarities between us.   


We opened up to each other a lot quicker than I have with a lot of people. That's saying a lot as I can be very anti\-social.  
We actually started confessing to each other that we felt very strongly for one another, which is also strange due to the short period of time of us knowing each other.  


We have voice called almost every single day since we met. We've spoke all night and all day, gotten drunk together, got high etc. She says I am her dream guy. As if I were perfect. I feel absolutely the same to her.

The only issue is, recently a lot of shit has been happening. My dog, who I had for over half of my life was put to sleep, my insomnia has been fucking me up, and a lot of family issues have been occurring. It's starting to get hard to speak to her. She knows about all this shit. I just keep pushing myself away. I can't help it. 

It hurts to know that I can't be there to hug her or anything due to the distance. She keeps saying she could come and visit, but the depressed anti\-social me tells her not to waste money on me. I don't know why I keep doing this. I need advice. Please, anyone. I really do want to see her in person, and actually get to enjoy her presence rather than be limited to speaking through a fucking microphone, but the depressed me just keeps making things harder.

7,"Just looking to see if anyone can relate. TL:DR I self medicate for anxiety/obsessive thoughts, looking for tips to avoid this behavior. (I'm trying to start seeing a therapist again also but 1sthand experience is helpful). 
I've had issues with using alcohol in an attempt to suppress my anxiety/unpleasant thoughts/be able to fall asleep and I just had a relapse into that habit. Of course it had to do with a woman... I can get obsessive (maybe a separate issue??) and this time I really fucked up, showing up unannounced at her apartment even though I should have known i was being ghosted. She is a heavy drinker and being around that briefly was all it took to set me off (use it as an excuse). Now I'm drunk on a work night because I caved this weekend and bought whiskey for the first time in a while. If i have it I drink it. Also took cough medicine with it (not tonight) which I haven't done on purpose until now. This was coupled with a moderate breakdown - I yelled and screamed to myself then sent a series of irrational messages which I have done before... Losing focus so idk where this is going anymore",14Jun2018,1,
8,"This has actually been going on for a few years now, but I'm finally getting out of my fear corner and actually asking about it. 

For the sake of giving some background on my mental state, I am autistic and was diagnosed with depression at age 12. I had a psychotic break when I was 18. I currently deal with auditory hallucinations and times of dissociation, usually made worse by stress. There's also anxiety and the occasional panic attack thrown into the mix. Said simply: My brain's a bit of a minefield.

Now, that shit above is pretty much handled. I have exercises I do to stay grounded and have hobbies to keep me going on days I don't want to.

This newish issue started a few years ago. Sometimes, for no reason I can understand, it's like I'm suddenly different personality wise. It's not another person, it's like an altered version of myself.

The best way I can describe how it feels is like this. Imagine that my personality is like a soft rock song on loop. Now, at random intervals, without missing a beat, the song changes from soft rock to death metal. Same melody, same lyrics, same tempo, but the genre is way different.

That's how it is for me and this other me. This other is quick to anger, quick to get offended, and just unpleasant. It's like whatever craps I could give were taken away, and instead of sleeping it off, I keep going with the intent to make everyone around me KNOW how little I care and how confident I suddenly am. 

If I ask myself ""Did I do something wrong?"" I usually answer back ""Yeah, and I need to keep working on it.""

But if the other me is out there, still me but awful, I answer the question with ""I'm fine. It's everyone else who's wrong.""

That's not who I really am, and I know it. That's why I'm concerned and asking about it. Is there a name for this? Usually I'd just say I'm overthinking, but the issue is that my mother is the exact same way, just worse. [think smooth jazz being covered by a grindcore band.]

Sorry if my analogies aren't clear, but this is the best way I can convey it. So, any ideas? I'd gladly go back to therapy for this, but I'm uninsured right now and can't afford anything for the time being.",14Jun2018,2,
9,"TLDR: I am rarely content anywhere I am. I constantly have a nagging feeling like I've forgotten something important, or have an obligation I need to get to, or like I've left the water running at home. 

About 2 years ago, 2016, I went through a breakup. Normal stuff, it happens, but this particular one was different somehow. It was the most oppressive feeling of emptiness I had ever felt.

Now, let me go ahead and say, I am not hung up on this girl. I rarely think about her, and I don't actively miss her. I've moved on.

But ever since then, my life has been painted in a different light. I felt out of sync, as if I'd somehow become the protagonist in someone else's slightly shittier, less meaningful life. I still kind of feel that way, like I got derailed and haven't been able to get back on track. I went into a depression for a while. I'm not actively depressed I don't think, but I'm not the opposite either. I'm not happy.

I don't find enjoyment in the things I used to, I have far less motivation in all areas of life than I used to, and the bit of enjoyment I get out of things is fleeting. When I go home and turn out the light for bed, I'm really uncomfortable being alone with my thoughts. I kind of dread bedtime every night. I stay up late to postpone it often. I've even recently developed anxiety and have anxiety attacks semi-frequently. 

But one thing that really interferes with everyday life is the nagging feeling that I've forgotten something, have to get back to something, or have to do something, and I just don't know what it is. It makes me feel like I can't stay at a friends house very long before needing to leave, or engage in conversations for very long before have to break away. I don't think it's boredom, I typically enjoy others' company. It's like feeling like you've left the oven on or the water running and have to get back and tend to that. I don't know. But it takes the enjoyment out of things, because I never feel like I can fully live in the moment.

Anyone else have this, or know what it is, or have any advice or solutions? I'm grasping for straws here. ",14Jun2018,3,

11,"This was a complete nightmare for me.

It happened about 3 years ago. And I can now finally face it and accept it.

It took me about 2.5 years to truly recover from this.

I know many people who go through this and the pain it causes.

I wanted to share my experience and story so people can feel ok that it's not something to be embarassed about or have a need to keep to yourself. 

It's ok to talk it out.

And I can tell you, can you and will be ok.

It's a bit long, and I've written a blog post about it here:

I'm a bit freaked out sharing this on Reddit of all place...but here goes. ",14Jun2018,1,
12,"I'm not sure how to type this out, please forgive me for any mistakes or confusion! It's my first time ever posting here, I'm open to suggestions, advice.. ect. 
I'm 21 years old, I live at home with 8 adults (siblings, their partners, mother and her husband), I work a part-time job (about 20-30hrs a week) in an arts and crafts store. I have been diagnosed officially from a young age (8-14ish) with manic depression, anxiety with severe paranoid delusions, bipolar, OCD.. I also have Aspergers. I'm not entirely sure of my other diagnoses, official names, or anything.. I apologize, I get that I have these issues, but I try not to remember the names for my own sake. I apologize, again. 
I have had past auditory/visual hallucinations, suicide attempts, self harm, hospital stays, ect.. I've also been to many therapists/psychologists with no such luck of finding one I feel comfortable opening up to. I apologize again, as I'm not sure how to introduce myself and word all of this. I just want to give background. I would say that, normally, when things are being handled well, I'm a pretty caring, passionate, loving person. I really love my family and friends and partner, I would do anything for all of them. I would say I maybe care TOO much and end up sacrificing myself and well-being for others often, and bend over backwards to make people happy, which.. I guess is a bad part of me, haha, or can be. My family is pretty dependant on me and I often feel like I'm the responsible one or the only one really willing to step up for anything. I am also a very anxious, paranoid person. I care very much if I'm doing a good job and being a good person and making the people I love around me happy, I often work myself up out of fear of rejection and being yelled at or making anyone unhappy. Anyway, 

To the point, though - for the past month, I have been in a very jarring state, one that is pretty hard to explain. It started out that I was extremely depressed, feeling numb, just overall wanting to die, careless.. able to sleep for half a day. About a week later, I started feeling more energetic, I was really happy, I thought I got out of my funk! But I noticed the depression is still there, but I have much more energy, too much, to the point of where my thoughts are racing and my body wants to just keep moving and flailing. I noticed that I feel no compassion or sympathy or care for anyone. I don't want to be touched or talked to or I get angry. I feel incredibly angry and aggressive, I have thoughts of wanting to just have a reason to beat people up, hurt myself, scream. I'll preface again by saying, default, I am very caring and love everyone and sympathize very much with the struggles and hardships of others. These thoughts are very scary, it almost feels as if I'm being controlled by something else, a different personality, its a complete 180 of how I usually feel and act. I know that I have anger issues and when I get angry, I get really angry. Never to the point of harming myself or others, though. I feel impulsive and I just want to have a reason to wail and scream and be violent. It's hard to explain, I hope this helps. I've noticed it feels like my body, heart, and mind is just a car, and there's 2 different version's of myself trying to have control, and the car is swerving and squealing like crazy. It feels like the control is leaving ""me"". I've been trying to cope by daydreaming and just listening to music... fantasizing about a perfect, stress-free life. I feel fine when I do that, but I still feel off and it doesn't last. I've been off and on medications, none have really helped a whole lot, I'd be open to trying again.. but I'm weary. I try to meditate and just breathe, exercise... it relieves me for a short while, but it all comes flooding back to me and its overwhelming, scary. I'm unsure of what to do, and I'm scared that the impulsive side will end up making me do something irrational. I already often feel like, in normal social situations (at work especially) that part of how I'm feeling will come through. I go on autopilot at work but I feel like its like my body is a cage and its just trying to claw out and go wild. I'm not sure I feel.. suicidal, but I really would like to disappear for awhile... I have had impulsive thoughts of hurting myself on tools at work and walking in front of cars and buses, I have the urges to scratch my arms and cut myself, I haven't done anything so far, luckily. I'm just worried of losing the will and control and doing any of that. 
My biggest passion is creating art and I have dreams of working in the animation field, but even that, I haven't had the drive or passion to make anything and it tears me apart. Creating art has always been one of those things I do to escape, so not even being able to do that is frustrating and hurts. I've tried making art, even vent art, and I end up just getting upset and pulling my hair and banging my hands against my legs and whining. My art is what defines me and what my whole life's drive is about and it feels like its been ripped away from me. 
I'm just at a loss, I don't know what to do. Talking doesn't help, and I end up feeling more frustrated and angry from opening up and being vulnerable. I don't enjoy being vulnerable or talking/showing my emotions often, but I also know that I'm a very... emotion-full person? If that makes sense. Being honest with how I feel is important to me and letting my loved ones know is also important, but I feel ashamed of it. I also don't want to make it sound like I'm self-depricating either - thats an issue I'm facing as well. My ""normal"" side is saying I should  feel bad for worrying people around me and having these thoughts of violence, meanwhile the side that is giving me all these feelings is unapolagetic and careless about anyone. I'm so sorry if this is an odd explanation. This in itself is pretty hard to write, as I have conflicting feelings and feel like I'm fighting myself for what I want to say.. but this is pretty accurate, and raw, I guess. 

Oof, this is pretty heavy. I'm open to thoughts, advice, ect ect... if anyone has questions or needs to know more or anything, just ask. I'll do my best to answer. Thank you so much for reading my ramblings, if you did.",14Jun2018,4,

I don't know what's wrong with me but maybe I'll find out more one day.

This past year I have gotten a lot worse, I'm now having panic attack sometimes twice a week, and denying myself food (not in an ED way such as because of physical appearance), lie in bed all day, and maladaptive daydream by pacing around my room for hours - which I've done since I was young but it has gotten progressively worse. I punish and sort of self sabotage myself constantly, and have horrible lucid nightmares nearly every night. 

But recently I feel like i'm not even myself anymore. I get vengeful and lash out over small things, and isolate myself to the point where it causes me inconvenience and don't leave the house for sometimes up to weeks (only leaving for summer classes). 

  I keep having intrusive thoughts that my parents are trying to poison me or purposefully starve me out. I know realistically this sounds insane but I sort of convince myself of it in the moment. I think I do do have disordered issues with eating but not in a traditional eating disorder sense

I feel disconnected from my body and like I'm observing the world from far away inside my own head. I'm aware of DPDR already which I know is a common symptom of anxiety. But it has escalated to the point where this is always having this looming feeling of guilt and dread hanging over me. ",14Jun2018,1,
23,"When I talk to friends, it's usually just casual small talk, like sharing memes or some dumb shit or trolling them. And when I do share deeper concerns with them, it feels transactional, like listen to me when life sucks and I'll listen to you when things get rough, not because I actually (care?) I just need to invest in a support system. Idk caring just feels reflexive and tiring.

And for family well my family is Asian so we tend to be more stoic and not too expressive. When I complained to my dad about wanting to transfer from the rigorous public university I attend and being reluctant to go back, he got extremely angry and said that ""well, in life, we often have to do stuff that we don't want to do, and this is one of them."" And while it'd be logistically easier not to transfer, I disagree with that because tons of people transfer colleges. 

In general, if I get angry/frustrated/upset at something, he just says ""the world doesn't fucking own you shit, and you just gotta grow up and deal with it."" Maybe that's true, and maybe that is something that I should learn as a young adult (5 days away from being 19; I'm female by the way), but sometimes I just don't want to interact with someone so jaded/somewhat harsh--like sometimes I want understanding/empathy. 

So yeah because of that, there's no one I really feel...idk...openly/extremely affectionate towards in my life--like idk that feeling you get when you see someone and you're just like ""wow, I'm really glad she or he is in my life; my existence would be so much worse without her or him because s/he is so caring and nice and genuine and amazing."" 

I just feel apathetic towards everyone and anything, and literally the only rush of dopamine I get is from success, which to me, as a premed college student, means getting a good grade on an exam, good grade in a tough class, getting a job/internship, idk whatever typically means success at 19 years old careers and college wise.

I went to a therapist twice and she never diagnosed me with anything. I feel like the sessions weren't helpful because they were never focused enough, although it's my fault for continually bringing up random unrrelated concerns successively instead of really zeroing in on a specific thing that really bothered me. 

Idk I just feel bad/apathetic all the time, and that other people's emotions are contagious or make me feel worse. People have suggested I have NPD or something or that I'm depressed. Don't know.

29,"I'm a 25 year old female living in the U.K. 

I'm unemployed, and I suffer with BPD, as well as anxiety/depression and other mental health issues.

I've been unemployed for almost 2 years, although in that time I've volunteered, gone back to college and re-trained in other courses. 

I've always been a little flaky with sticking  to plans and arrangements, but as of lately (last six months) it's becoming a real issue for me. I just can't seem to stick to the plans I make for myself. Whatever it may be - a Doctors appointment, an arrangement to see family or a friend, nine times out of ten I'll re-schedule it for a few days later or for the following week. 

I always get a sense of dread when I'm busy, and I think as I've been out of a structured daily routine for so long it's very alien for me to be busy.

I work a few volunteer jobs, and I'm constantly cancelling my arrangements to volunteer. As I'm not paid for the work, and it's voluntary, it's rare I'll 'get into trouble' for cancelling (as you would in paid work) so I think that contributes to making it more appealing/easy to cancel.

However, my inability to stick to plans has a very detrimental affect on my life! 
My bosses at volunteering often have been let down, or disappointed by my failure to turn up. Family and friends have told me they've felt pushed away  and (as my bosses from volunteering are my references when I apply for jobs) I think I'm really setting a picture that I'm unreliable and not dependable. 

I feel like my family, friends and colleagues expect me to cancel half the time. I really don't know how to break this habit. 

I've talked to my counsellor about it and he thinks it's to do with a sense of not feeling good enough and wanting to hide away. After cancelling, I usually spend the day regretting having cancelled/feeling guilty and like a failure - so it rarely ever does me any good! 

I suppose that also, on the other hand; being in paid work is always motivation to show up. 

Any advice on this matter would be hugely appreciated! How do you stay motivated? Do you guys stick to plans or cancel a lot? Thanks in advance. ❤️

30,"I have been diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, though my illnesses have been mostly under control since starting antidepressants many years ago. I am now 26 but I’ve taken Celexa, and then Lexapro since the age of 15.

But I am always tired. I sleep from whenever I fall asleep (typically 12am-3am because I work second shift) sometimes until 1pm the next day. 

For the few hours I am up, I am exhausted. I yawn a lot. I just want to crawl back in bed. 

I have a hard time enjoying myself because I’m just so sleepy. 

I can’t tell if it is the medication, or my messed up sleep schedule, or both. Or if it is something else entirely. 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

31, My memories don't feel real and some of the ones that do feel out of sync. Something that could've happened a few hours ago might feel like it happened a few months ago. Along with constant déjà vu of things that I know could've only happened once. ,14Jun2018,1,
32,"I (30F) find that I have recently developed a strong aversion to sex. Just thinking or reading about it makes me feel anxious. I'm single, so it's not affecting any current relationships, but it's making dating very, very difficult as anytime a new person wants to do anything (even kissing for some people) I end up getting freaked out.

I don't have any history of sexual trauma, and while I grew up in a fairly sexually conservative environment I've dealt with my hangups from that and up until very recently, I've been very sex-positive and have really enjoyed sex and sexual activities, so I know I'm not asexual either.

I've even pretty much stopped masturbating because it makes me extremely depressed for several days afterwards.

I'm worried that it might be related to insecurity &amp; some rejection issues I have. I have a history of previous partners cheating on me or dumping me because they found me unattractive, including my most recent serious boyfriend. I've also had frequent issues with my libido being higher than that of my partners, and partners who preferred porn to sex. I have no issues with porn in general - I watch &amp; read porn both solo and with partners - but find it hurtful when a partner consistently chooses porn rather than sex.

A friend that I hooked up with shortly after my breakup (six months ago) made some disparaging comments about my weight that have kind of stuck with me. I feel like I don't feel comfortable getting naked around people and the thought of having sex is disgusting. 

A completely different friend has said that they're sexually attracted to me but that they don't want to have sex with me because of our history together where I developed an unrequited crush on them a while back and they've said they don't want to lead me on. Logically I know that they're probably not lying to me, but emotionally I can't help feeling like they told me they were attracted to me out of pity/to make me feel better.

I know that I probably need therapy to deal with my issues but that isn't really an option for me right now. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and if you found anything that helped.",14Jun2018,2,

Ive struggled for years with both conditions and have been taking sertraline everyday for the past six weeks. 

Ive noticed a big change. Before i got wound up and frustrated very easily id get heart palpitations, lose concentration, cry over small things and always have a sense of dread about everything. And on the opposite side the depression had me feeling extremely low and lethargic, suicidal thoughts low self esteem and the constant foggyness that comes with it.

Now i dont really worry much or get wound up. The heart palpitations aren't there. I dont feel such low a moods and everything seems to be levelling out mentally not so much low and manic episodes. My appetite has even reduced. Where before i was always hungry. 

But... Im sleeping a lot like 16 hours a day a lot. Is there anything i can do or have to pep me up a bit apart from coffee/tea? i usually have a cup when i wake.

i’ve faced a problem a few months ago and i don’t know what to do about it and how should i react to not make things worse. i have a friend who is my classmate in the university and lately she really doesn't look like she’s ok. the problem is that she always denies that she feels bad and says she’s fine, which is a total lie, she also doesn’t seem to trust people and i’m the only one she told something about how she feels. sometimes she skips a couple of days or doesn’t speak at all, goes offline and so on and nobody knows how’s she and what’s going on. she keeps saying it’s okay and it’s  just “episodes”, but i’m really worried :( 
today she told me that she constantly thinks that everyone in my class including her friend hate her and always think about how lame she is so she is scared to talk to people. this is completely wrong because i know these people talked about how worried they are. 
i need an advice or something from people who has or had anxiety/depression (i guess that’s what she has?) and know how should i treat her and try to make her feel better because she doesn’t believe a single word i say about how beautiful and loved she is

42,"(I'm sorry I'm from France so our school system is probably different than yours and my grammar isn't the best, I hope it's understandable)

We both live with our parents. He's been lying like a lot of kids about his grades when he was in high school. 

Now he's in university, he spent 3 years in year 1 making us believe every year he passed when in fact his grades were too low to pass. 
When I found out about that (it was during 2017) I made him tell the truth to our parents. 
They were really mad about the lying thing because he's been lying for us for 3 years. 
Eventually things got better.

Now he's in year 2, and he told us today he passed to go to year 3.
My mum having a little trust issue about his grades asked him the paper proving he passed. He showed her the one of last year, thinking she'd fall for that. Because his grades are once again to low to pass, so he has to do another 2nd year. 
My mom got super mad about his lying because he's a 23 year old guy fucking up his life, he's not interested in anything and my parents and I are worried about his future because we live in a society in which you have to work to gain money and stay alive, but it's something he doesn't seem bothered about. 

He saw 2 therapists when he was younger (before the lying stuff) because my parents were worried about his future already. They didn't really help so they don't seem to really want him to see a 3rd one. But the way he's been lying is really crazy, and I really think he should seek for help because it doesn't seem normal to me. 

He isn't manipulative or anything, he's honestly the sweetest guy I've met and it sucks that he's like that, because he makes the whole family feels bad, and himself is really upset and doesn't understand why he does that. 

Please tell me your opinion about that, it happened like an hour ago, I don't know what to do and if seeing a specialist would help him with his issues.

43,"I started counselling on Monday, 4th of June and I have to say, for all those who are worried about speaking to someone, it's gone a million times better than I could've ever expected (not in the sense that I'm cured, but I was so so afraid of doing it.)  I've gone to counselling to help with anger, depression and anxiety. 

However, I seem to only be finding that my anger is being suppressed, while I am still struggling heavily with depression and anxiety. Mathematically, I am 1/3 (I've had two sessions out of six) of the way through the counselling, so it makes sense that only 1/3 of my problems are seeming to fizzle down. BUT I've always had the belief that my anger would be the easiest thing to sort out and that the ""sorting out"" of the depression and anxiety would take longer.

And it's not my counselor's fault, there's only 50 minutes each session, and I'm only allocated 6, but I'm really, really worried it won't be enough, but they won't extend how many sessions I have until I finish this ""course"" and then return to their (rather long) waiting list for more sessions. I also strongly believe, if not then I **know**, that it won't help my anxiety because my anxiety presents itself  in a more physical sense, rather than a psychological sense.

Just wondering if I should go to the doctor and ask for an anti\-depressant? They said I ""had to do the six sessions in full"" before they considered medication, but I'm against the clock here for recovery, so I need to start medication soon, if not now.",14Jun2018,1,
44,"My anxiety is currently out of control for multiple reasons and I’m desperate to get it under control. I started taking a new adhd medication this past week, my first time on a stimulant. I’m in the middle of writing a masters thesis and I’m pretty behind (due in no small part to my mental health). And, I just got a dog back who I raised for a service dog program, but he got washed because of a health issue. My eye doctor suggested that I might try using him to mitigate balance and orientation issues caused by low vision since he was used to working with me and had been already trained, but now my place of employment wants all kinds of documentation and to interview me.  Raise and train a young puppy for a year at work = no problem, bring a train service dog to work = Spanish Inquisition. 

Also, the first night I had my dog back home one of my boyfriend’s dogs attacked me and my dog. This is the second time this dog has attacked us. My BF has about 72 theories as to why and all of them blame me and my service dog, instead of his dog who starts fights all the time. So we had to pack up and leave his house where we had been staying and go back to my apartment at 1am and I spent the rest of the night sick from the adrenaline from being attacked again. 

All of this has culminated in me not sleeping or eating for about four days. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m sitting at work trying not to throw up, I’m so freaking tired, and my thoughts are racing so badly that I can’t focus to do anything.

My parents are not supportive at all, they make me feel very unwelcome in the house and regularly ask me to leave. I'm trying to study for resits to get into vet school but I flopped my first exams because I need extra time but don't have it. This is because I recently found out I'm autistic, my parents are also completely dismissive of my diagnosis. I spent a month bed ridden and in pain after an operation I had on my nose went wrong, this is while my ex was playing mind games with me after I broke up with her. And I only broke up with her because I was so depressed and it was unfair on her (she did get into vet school and goes to Edinburgh). We had a great relationship before I was depressed. I still miss her as well and it's been six months. 

This isn't even all of it. I've spent almost a year completely utterly depressed and unable to function, I have these thoughts which are so negative that I can't control. I just walk around cringing actively trying not to let them take hold of me. I am so worried ill kill myself on results day. I don't even know what or where ill be studying because Im sure I've messed up my exams. I'm probably on my gap year because I didn't have extra time last year.

46,"howdy - I'm 19 yrs old (turning 20 in september) and I wanted to post this to see if anyone has experienced this, or if this is normal and im overthinking it or what.

some context:
* im a 3rd shift (9pm to 6am) custodian at one of the largest zoos in the United States.
* ive already been professionally dx'd with depression, anxiety, and chronic migraines. i am 98% certain I have ADHD also. i do not take any meds. i dont sleep very well either.
* i already have mild memory problems. i frequently lose important objects (keys, wallet, etc.) even though i have special places in my apartment i leave them at when i get home.

now for the actual incident:

i was cleaning one of the largest bathrooms at the whole park at around 12 am. i had finished wiping down the sinks and counters and i decided to move onto the toilets. i remember pulling out the johnny mop and going through and cleaning all the men's toilets. i don't remember putting down the johnny mop, but i remember a point where it wasn't in my hands anymore.

i decided that i wanted to start on the women's side, and i assumed i had placed the mop in the caddy inside the closet. i went in to grab it, only to find that the johnny mop wasn't there. i went back to the men's to go check if i left it in a stall on one of the toilets or something. not only was it not there, but none of the toilets were clean.

i spent 10-15 minutes looking for the johnny mop - i checked the men and women's stalls, the counters, under the sinks, in the closet, the piping, the truck, trashcans, etc. i never found it and none of my coworkers have since then. i honestly don't know where it is or where it could've gone. i also don't know what i was doing for the 15 minutes when i thought i was cleaning the toilets. none of them were clean so obviously i must've been doing something else.

i dont think it was sleep-related because 1. i wasnt tired before or after the blackout, and 2. i have fallen asleep in the middle of working before and this wasn't the same feeling.

i know adhd has memory issues but ive never heard of blackouts like this. im not asking for a diagnosis, but i want to narrow down what this could be a symptom of or if im just overthinking something that happens to everyone. ive tried researching myself but its difficult to find information beyond ""this could be early onset alzheimer's.""",14Jun2018,1,

48,"**\*\*\*Warning, may trigger some of you\*\*\***

**Hey guys, I know this is a bit of a long post, but if you suffer from mental illness (especially depression/anxiety/PTSD/insomnia) then it might be worth a read:**

When I was very sick (mentally), I knew the day would come when I would feel ""normal"" again. Even though it seemed impossible at the time, I never lost hope. And **I always promised myself that if I was able to dig myself out of that hell hole, I would share my story to hopefully inspire and help others in similar positions.** So here we go.

It all began when, out of boredom, I decided to travel abroad in the search of ""adventure"". I traveled to my home country (from Canada) and ended up falling in love. I ended up moving to said country, after this person ""proposed"" (he casually asked if I wanted to get married). My family, who lived in Canada in the U.S were horrified, but there was nothing anybody could do to stop me. 

This ""charming bad boy"" who I fell blindly in love with ended up being an emotionally and psychologically abusive (and even physically and sexually abusive), lazy, momma's boy (we lived mostly with his mom who did *everything* for him) with a major drinking and drug problem. Many, many things happened in the 4 years I was with him, including physical and sexual abuse, constant emotional abuse/control/jealousy, etc...  I mean, I could write a book about it. I know now that I stayed with him because of my psychological relationship map that was formed from having an emotionally, physically, (and I suspect even sexually) abusive father. **All this resulted in me developing severe cases of clinical depression, anxiety, PTSD and even suicidal tendencies**. On top of that, I had many other instances of sexual abuse (rape) and physical assault happen to me that made my symptoms even worse.

**My PTSD was so bad that I couldn't even talk to people, I couldn't leave the house, I couldn't talk on the phone, or do anything social without having a major panic attack and freezing**. It was literally impossible for me to do anything social without medication (as in, not even once). But after a near death experience (caused by neglect in that relationship), and being dumped by him, I finally ""woke up"" and returned to North America with a new outlook on life. Unfortunately I still had major PTSD and had to take medication to be able to even leave the house, but I had greater expectations for my life this time and would not settle for less.

I unfortunately continued on the habits I picked up while abroad to cope with my issues. These habits included binge drinking on weekends (partying), smoking, and eating almost nothing but junk food to cope with my pain and anxiety. I had to take medication every single time I left the house, I was unable to hold down a job due to my mental issues, I had no social life whatsoever. Every! Single! Morning! upon waking up, I would have a few seconds of bliss before my PTSD symtoms would kick in: racing heart beat that felt like a major heart attack, sweaty palms, shortness of breath, etc. Any loud noise (cars honking, for example) or even someone suddenly talking to me would startle me and sometimes even make me jump. I was constantly on edge and people constantly asked me if I was okay. **It was a complete living hell** \- which I endured for MANY years, NON\-stop. 

**The funny thing about mental illness is that after a while of suffering with it, it somehow becomes a part of your identity and you learn to grow comfortable with it. For me, it was very hard to let go of the idea of feeling constantly anxious, and it was hard for me to embrace the idea of having a life without anxiety, PTSD or depression.** 

I tried so many things throughout the years to get better; yoga, meditation, exercise (running/lifting weights/pilates), natural herbs and supplements, phenibut, l\-theanine,  marihuana, CBD oil, therapy, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), aromatherapy, acupressure, breathing exercises, self\-hypnosis, MANY, many different types of medication (anti\-depressants/benzos/anticonvulsant), etc, etc, ETC ... **But nothing seemed to work**, and in fact, some made *it m*uch worse. 

I remember one day many years ago, I stumbled upon a[ youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nylajeG6uFY&amp;list=PLD8-7zY_7MknXoph5hHREp5efU9RfcnWr) talking about **EMDR** (e*ye movement desensitization and reprocessing*), made a note on it and then forgot about it (I wish I had taken it more seriously! It would have saved me so many more years of hardship and added trauma). Eventually, I stumbled upon it again a few years later and remembered that I had read about many people claiming it helped them with their PTSD. Unfortunately I did not have the financial means to hire a professional, but I was so desperate that I decided to attempt it on myself... **and I believe that decision saved my life**.

I began researching as much as I could regarding EMDR therapy and started experimenting on my own (which I do not necessarily recommend \- more on that later). I remember the first session that I did was about my trauma regarding leaving the house to walk my dog (without medication). Something that I would have never even attempted  in the past. After my EMDR session (it was at night), I went to sleep and kind of forgot about it. The next day I woke up and when I thought about walking my dog, I felt surprisingly comfortable and decided to just go for it (not giving it too much thought). **And wow... how can I even describe what I felt.** I was able to walk my dog all by myself, with absolutely* zer*o medication and* zer*o anxiety for the first time. It was amazing and surreal. That was the beginning of many more sessions that followed suit in my self\-healing journey.

That being said, I have to add that I have always had an interest in psychology (ironically I have always wanted to become a psychologist \- and might still one day), and that even though I had suffered from all these mental issues in the past, I do know how to navigate my mind very well. So, after doing a lot of research on EMDR, I felt confident I could handle it on my own. I say this because **I do not recommend anyone attempting EMDR on their own** (without professional help) if they have no idea how consciousness, subconsciousness, memory, and traumas even work or how the brain works in general, and especially how EMDR work in connection to these. 

After I started healing myself ""spiritually"" and psychologically, it prompted me to start taking care of my physical body, as well. **I firmly believe that when your mind is not healthy, you neglect your body because there is a disconnect. But once you start feeling healthy on the inside, you re\-connect with your body and start taking care of it.**  To continue on with my story \- even though my ""spiritual mind"" was healing, I still suffered from insomnia, depression, foggy brain, constipation, and lethargy. I began researching how to heal my body and stumbled upon people talking about ""gut health"". Basically, I found out that your gut (digestive organs) is connected to your mind and it greatly affects your mood, your energy levels, and your overall health in major ways..**.**(you can* *[google ""gut mind connection.""](https://www.google.ca/search?q=gut+mind+connection&amp;oq=gut+mind&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j69i65j0l3.4112j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)*)* I decided to not only go on a detox to help heal my gut, but try a **raw vegan diet** (I had read and seen the [success storie](https://youtu.be/lgovSvMZMw0?t=2m52s)s online). And guys, that was the last piece of the puzzle; it **completely changed my life**. I began to have more energy than I ever had before, my mind is now crystal clear, I no longer suffer from constipation, my insomnia is gone, my depression is gone, my skin is clearer and is not oily anymore, my hair is shinier and growing fast, my nails are stronger, and the benefits keep on coming with time.

My life now\-a\-days consists of them, [my rescue dog](https://scontent.fcxh2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/11083762_728676327231337_5764124148280510288_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;oh=ed241bde8004f604d7eaa3c219bc54a9&amp;oe=5BA6CEAD) (I rescued her from the streets while abroad and she was my light during my darkest moments), going on hikes and other outings/walks/adventures, working out, working from home, and much more. But while my self\-healing/ self\-improvement journey is still not done, I am the happiest I have ever been and I'm excited about the future.

To conclude, if you suffer from any sort of mental illness, just know that it is possible to turn your life around 100&amp;#37;. The main thing I have learned about my journey to health, is this: ***You do not know how sick you are until you are healthy.*** Going from a sick body (and mind) that was constantly low on energy, had nightmares, insomnia, foggy mind (poor memory, slow processing, etc), really bad eating habits, constipation, major panic attacks, anxiety, depression, paranoia, major anger issues, etc... to one that is full of energy, healthy, a mind that is clear, happy and at peace... The difference guys... is a whole other world. I know the leap may seem steep, if not impossible when you are feeling like complete garbage. But let me tell you; it's not impossib**le. Your mind is the most powerful tool you **have; and you CAN have the life you dream of. Just keep searching until you find what works for you, and never, ever give up. Hopefully the things that have helped me can help you, as well.

If you managed to read up until now, thank you. I wish you the very best in your healing journey and if you have any questions at all (I am an open book), please feel free to ask. Or if you would just like someone to talk to, feel free to message me. Also, I have thought about making some online materials to help others (EMDR videos or a website), let me know if this is something that could help you (all resources would be free\- I just want to help others heal themselves).

**TL; DR: After a troubled childhood and abusive relationship, I developed major, debilitating PTSD, anxiety and depression that I was able to self\-cure through EMDR therapy and going on a Raw Vegan diet. My life has drastically improved for the better and I want to inspire others with my story.**

51,"My boyfriend and i have been dating for almost 2 years now, and for the past year his mental health has been on the decline. he has told me was depressed when we first met but throughout the first year of our relationship, he was happy. for the last year however, things have been getting worse for him.

Recently he got suspended from his job (he missed 2 days and showed up late 2 days) and it’s unknown wether they’ll keep him around. his friends are also beginning to go their separate ways and these two things have seem to have made his depression worse. 

he constantly talks down on himself, he has very low self esteem, he doesn’t know what he wants to do with his life, he doesn’t initiate any dates in the relationship, he doesn’t call me on the phone (we just text), he can be very quiet and hard to talk to sometimes, he’s emotionally detached pretty much. 

i have tried to be there for him and support him through all of this because i have also struggled with mental health issues (GAD, hypochondria, emetophobia) and i know what it’s like to feel alone and not want to get help. however i went to a therapist and got treatment for a year and i’m much better now, and he himself saw how effective therapy was, in my case. 

i’ve asked him to get help, to tell his family, and he just refuses. he feels like they’ll judge him and find him weak. i’ve considered telling his mother what’s going on but i know it’s not the appropriate way to go about this and he would be really upset with me.

it’s at the point where i don’t know what to do. i’m pretty much his only support system, his friends don’t know about this. his family doesn’t either. i love him dearly and i don’t want to leave him in this time of need, but this is affecting me and our relationship and i feel like i’m putting in all of the work. i’m only 18 and i’m going to be starting college soon, and it’s just a lot to handle. i also feel selfish for feeling this way, as he has a much bigger problem to deal with than me feeling unhappy and unsafisfied in the relationship.

i told him if he doesn’t seek help then i don’t know how much longer i can do this. i probably shouldn’t have said it but i was feeling really overwhelmed.  

tl;dr my boyfriend is depressed and won’t seek help. it’s affecting me and our relationship negatively. i love him, but it’s becoming a lot and i don’t know what to do.

53,"I suffer from anxiety, depression and other issues which leads to suppressed anger issues, sleep problems and other things. The long story short is, it cost me my job when I shouted at my boss a month ago. This has put me into a small spiral of despair...

Now I've just been on holiday with my girlfriend. The first two days were perfect, however on the third day we ended up arguing and I've said some extremely hurtful, nasty things to her and it's basically ruined everything. She is a wonderful, kind, gentle soul and probably far more than I ever deserve. She's a single parent with a young child (a situation I've never been in before, I've never been with anyone with such responsibilities). I love them both.

The issue is my commitment issues. I think deep down I have problems that affect my day to day life and decision making/motivation. I've had childhood trauma and a lifetime of struggling with my own mind. I've had problems with alcoholism and smoking cannabis and generally falling into a pit of despair.

However when we got together she was amazing, she changed my outlook and helped to pick me up. However she has her own issues involving grieving in regards to losing a parent recently, and I've not been very supportive. Lately for some reason I've turned toxic and the anger problems have been coming out again.

I've never harmed her (or anyone else for that matter), but my mood swings and bitterness and ugly behaviour has been emerging again and I think I'm just about to lose her as a result of some of the horrible stuff I've been saying and my selfish ways.

This morning it has all become clear - we've discussed breaking up and I fully support her decision. She deserves better than me. I cannot blame her, I take full responsibility for my actions and I'm not making any excuses, I know I've messed up.

But the thought of losing her is just horrific. I don't think she'll want to stay friends due to the sheer pressure of her grief, my mental illness and such.

I don't know what to do. I've bought myself some zinc tablets, fruit, vegetables and such in a bid to change my diet. I've resisted buying alcohol or cannabis and I'm trying to change the way I think. I've booked into the doctors for next week. But it's too little too late. 

In the past I've tried certain anti-depressants and have tried cognitive behavioural therapy, but I felt the CBT course wasn't too good for me and the tablets numbed me and I didn't feel like I had any motivation and I was mixing them with weed and beer and it made me worse. I weaned myself off the tablets, but I'm not sure if I want to go back on them.

I'd rather speak to someone and see if they can properly diagnose me, figure out what my actual condition is.... Maybe something undiagnosed like ADHD or bipolar disorder. 

I need advice. I'm not expecting to save my relationship, but I don't want to fall back into a pit of depression again. But I'm also equally scared of getting back with her before I've had any treatment or made any progress in 'fixing' myself...

54,"He has been posted things that come across as odd. They don't make any sense. It's like he sees cause and effect in a way that doesn't make sense, and has somehow made a mental connection between things that (at least to me and others as outsiders) don't have anything in common. For example, his posts often draw direct connections between the War on Terrorism and his personal life - to be clear, he is not a soldier, doesn't post about having any family involved in the war, and is not religious but is from the US. An example is that he seems to imply very heavily that the same people who are in control of the War in Iraq are hiring people to stalk him and ""shame him"" for being a heterosexual male or something, and are the reason he has a hard time finding employment. He also implies that they forced him to flee a felony charge of cocaine possession, which I can't really find any records on but the state he claims to have fled might have stricter privacy rules than some others. 

He used to be an academic - as recently as 2015 he was presenting papers at conferences - but his posts imply that he was maybe let go or kicked out due to his behavior.

I am not a psychologist or psychiatrist and I don't have any sort of background in that field, so I have no idea whether his posts are just some sort of in joke or just how he talks or if he's actually mentally ill. It appears to me, as a layman, that he has some sort of psychosis or delusion or paranoia, especially because of the strange leaps in logic that he presents as very linear. He hasn't threatened violence to himself or anything but his posts are very angry, and they do sometimes indicate self-destructive behavior and anger at people that have reported him in the past.

55,"About a year ago, I gained what I though was full control over the anxiety and depression I’ve been dealing with for years.  My cheeks became rosie, and my confidents was at an all time high. So much so, that I decided that I am going to fulfill a dream of mine — to backpack around Australia. After work one day, I made a b-line home and applied for a working holiday visa, and was accepted a week later. I was so excited, however, this was also when I could start to feel the progression I’ve made with start to regress.



Needless to say, this big trip I’m planning for has taken its tole on me. I’m stressed 24/7 about it, and it’s getting to the point where I don’t know if I should be going. I’d consider myself a seasoned traveller. I’ve travelled sooo many times. I went to Eastern Europe last summer, planned everything myself, and made it home. Had a few hiccups along the way, but I was able to cope. But this trip is different. It’ll be the biggest trip I’ve ever taken. And I’ve become stressed about all the things I still need to do for it. 



I can’t tell if this is “normal stress” or having dealt with anxiety in the past has something to do with it. Because I’m feeling exactly as I would have been a few years ago. My face is starting to look — haggard, and I have these lovely dark circles around my eyes, and I’m exhausted all the time.

58,"hello!

i'm 19, and i've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder (with psychotic features) for about 7 years now. throughout this time i only had one break of my severe symptoms, and that was after my first ECT treatment when i was 15. it lasted 6-8 months i'm guessing. and then i spiraled back down. so if you do the math, i've been in an intensive depressive episode for approximately 4 years now. 

i've read persistant depressive disorder (aka dysthymia) is diagnosed after a continuous 2 year or longer depressive episode. i read that PDD can come in 2 subtypes: a mild but chronic form, and a more severe but chronic form. but a lot of sites also solely describe it as mild but long lasting. my group therapist always described it as more severe. so i'm confused. i was also under the impression MDD was characterized by having breaks between episodes. 

my depression is: chronic, very severe, very much impairs every aspect it can, and with a single break within 7 years due to ECT treatment. 

what would this be? MDD? PDD? neither? both?

i'm going to look more into it too.

there are times that i think about my future. i just cant see my life after im close to 30, or even further. im scared that ill get even more depressed, and ill hang myself. yeah, i know, everything can happen, my life can get better, but im a pussy. i mean, really, i always tell my mom to do something for me. im turning 18 in december, and im afraid of my responsibilities. things in my life already got bad, i tried to kill myself more than 10 times and i ended up being in a mental hospital in 2016. i feel better right now, but when i think i won't be able to bear with future responsibilities i'll just give up.

60," Ok, so a little background about myself since this is my first post on this subreddit. I'm a 19 year old male who's currently just finished my first year at University and I'm on a 3 month break until I return in September. Since I was 16/17, I've been suffering what I can only describe as social anxiety (never seen myself as shy or reclusive). I get flustered in social situations, out of breath in public areas (conscious of my breathing), fear of criticism and low self\-esteem, difficulty in approach people or doing menial tasks such as talking to people on the phone, hate eating or typing with people behind me and so forth. Up until now, I've repressed these feelings, ignoring them because I felt that they weren't as serious as other people's symptoms or that I would ""forget"" these feelings a couple of days later when I felt better.

That was my situation until a couple of weeks ago in mid May where I finally told enough is enough. A myriad of visiting [r/mensLib](https://www.reddit.com/r/mensLib), reading [this article on the BBC about men not having sexual encounters or friendships until their late 30s](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43956366) and other instances of men's issues in the media has given me confidence to actually seek help. I realised that this cannot go on during my 2nd, 3rd, 4th years at uni. I'm sick that this has held me back from contributing in my German classes and the fact that I'm scared to participate in my debate society (I paid for a £10 membership but only attended once) I'm sick to death that I can't just approach anyone without thinking about every goddamn encounter about 100000 times in my head. Anyway I digress. I started writing I finally worked up some courage to consider visiting my GP and this summer definitely is a good opportunity I was planning on visiting my GP surgery at my university however two factors held me back:

a) When I had considered visiting my GP at university, I only had two weeks until I went back home therefore I probably wouldn't be able to be put on medication since my uni GP would need to see me about a week after taking them to track my progress.

b) I had spring exams to prepare for and pretty much every day was spent in the library therefore I had no time to fit in an appointment.

So, as aforementioned, I'm back at my home address and I can't visit my GP without my parents taking me. This feels really silly but I'm really afraid of approaching my parents about this issues. I'm very rarely open about my personal issues to anyone including my parents and I'm not sure whether they would understand how I'm feeling right now. While I'm pretty sure they understand that I'm rather introverted and that I don't have any close friends but again, whether they would understand how hard it is for me to approach people or how it feels to have this feeling in public is another issue. My parents aren't exactly open to talk therapies as I was put through unnecessary speech therapy when I was in primary school and they generally don't like people (especially people in the local area) meddling in their affairs. The sooner I work up the courage to discuss this with my parents the better. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated.",14Jun2018,3,

63,"I'm trying to understand what exactly is wrong with me. For as long as I can remember I was extremely sad. To the point of course where I drove people away because I was negative all the time, still am but I don't think I am as much as I used to be. I'm trying to improve but it's harder everyday. For the last 3-4 years I'm thinking of killing myself and I can't get these thoughts away and I think about it a lot during the day at random times but it quickly fades away then comes back again. I don't really find anything interesting and the reason I haven't done it so far is probably because I'm still trying to find something that will keep me interested and focused.

Aside from that, what I'm really struggling with lately is shaky hands. It started when I was about 15 years old when I noticed my hands started shaking a little for some reason. About 2 years ago I realized it was because I was anxious all the time and it keeps getting worse. This would only happen to me in some occasions but not always but now it's almost every time I'm out my hands are shaking no matter what. I don't know if we're talking about an anxiety disorder here because I haven't gone to a doctor to get diagnosed and don't like it when people self diagnose so I'm just asking if it could be something like that. Everyday, from the moment I walk outside I feel like I'm drowning, my shoulders stretch and it's like I'm in ""defense mode"" for no reason. It gets even worse when I'm with people around, even friends, or when I'm meeting someone new or when I do something I haven't done before in front of a bunch of people, it's basically all the time and get worse when I have to do something around people. About a week ago I went out with some friends and it got so bad I could barely hold the glass of beer, couldn't even drink it because I was so shaky. Eventually I calmed down after a while and managed to drink but I was still shaking.

68,"Hey so I kind of need to vent, because I have no idea who I could talk to and I'm not sure what's happening to me. I've noticed that over the span of the last year I've become more and more unhappy. It's like it's impossible to satisfy me. I always fee like I know what I'm missing, but I'm never right. Like for example: A while ago I would always feel very lonely and I thought I needed to spend some time with people, preferrably my friends. But then when I would meet my friends I would hang out with them for hours and as soon as I left and as soon as I was alone again I wouldn't feel any better. 

Then I thought I was unhappy because I needed to make new friends and I did and after about two weeks I was really unhappy, because they weren't as excited about spending time with me as I was. Which is fair, because I was honestly way too eger about it. 

Then I thought that I really needed a job or something to do with my life because I was feeling really worthless and dissapointing and I got an internship and I'm more unhappy than ever before.

What I've noticed through all of this is that no matter what was bothering me I barely ever talk to my friends or family about it. I would always go on these long rants to the before mentioned new friends. I often talk to poeple that have known me for a few months at the most and tell them everything about all of my emotions and it's not like I waited for them to ask about it. For some reason I'm also weighing these peoples opinions about me way more than the opinions of people I used to care about. 

I often think that I could technically talk to my close friends or family, but I always decide against it and I don't understand why. I think maybe I don't want them to tell me to get help even though I'm already planning on that.

72,"This actually happened last year but I haven't felt comfortable enough talk about this until now. Even so, I don't feel 100&amp;#37;, which is why I created a new account. 

I am a student at Rutgers University in the New Brunswick campus. In my junior year at Rutgers, I had changed my major and needed to take a lot of Intro Science courses to graduate. Anyone who goes to the school knows that while not too challenging, the departments make the intro classes are weed-out classes. At the time, I was taking General Biology 2, Physics 2, and Chemistry 2 (my fault) all in the same semester. I was also in a relationship which was pretty toxic and making life more difficult. 

As the semester goes on, I begin to fall behind in chemistry due to the increased amount of fighting with my SO which made me somewhat less motivated to attend class. Fast forward a few weeks and we get into a bad argument which leads to to leave her place late at night. She attempts to call me but I was upset and ignored all of her calls and texts (my fault again). She then proceeds to call the police and tell them about my occasional thoughts of suicide. The cops find me and I am interviewed by a Fire Marshall trained for these situations. I understand that I need help and I should have gone earlier. An ambulance shows up and I am taken to the Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care. There I'm interviewed by a resident doctor who says that I don't need inpatient treatment and I will be released tomorrow morning. As it turns out, I also have a chemistry exam the next day as well which makes me feel more anxious than secure. 

I study in my room for about 10 minutes until a nurse comes into my room and takes it from me. I sleep a decent amount until I hear people screaming in the morning. When I wake up, I am taken next door to meet with a nurse practitioner. She tells me that she would recommend me for medication, but it is not required. I refuse and ask if the meeting could be sped up as the exam is only an 2 hours away. I was refused on that request and also refuses my request for a doctor's note even though I was not allowed access to my study materials the night before. After the meeting, I am told to wait in the lobby for my social worker. I am waiting in this lobby for 50 minutes until I figured I have to leave now to make it in time for my exam. 

On my way to the bus stop, I get a call from the nurse I just met with. She told me to come back but I told her that if I do, I need a doctor's note, and then my phone dies; bad luck, I swear. I go back to my room and get my phone charger so I can return the call. When my phone turns on, I get a missed call notification from Rutgers Police, at this point, I'm screwed. I call RUPD and ask for the officer that I received a call from to which they responded with, ""She's not in right now, call back later."" I give them my location and tell to please pass along the message. A few minutes later, 4 squad cars pull up to my apartment and I am sitting outside in handcuffs. Another ambulance shows up and takes me right back to where I was the night before.

I get back to UBHC and the nurses tell me that I'm now screwed. I try explaining my situation and tell them I went to meet with the nurse practitioner like they requested. I was told that since I didn't meet with my social worker, there is no evidence that I had went in the first place. Another resident doctor interviews me and now my situation has changed. He had a different opinion; I should be taken upstairs for inpatient treatment and prescribed with SSRIs. I wait another few hours and I accept my fate, there's no way I'm getting out of this. I ask the doctor about my missed exams and classes and told me not to worry, the Dean has power over the departments. Everything I miss could be made up or forgiven.

A few hours go by and I am taken upstairs to the inpatient unit. I meet with another doctor who told me that SSRIs would not be acceptable for a situation like this and she would prescribe me different medications. Since this was ""voluntary"", I could refuse medication. I refuse, and was threatened everyday by the doctor that if I refuse her treatment, she could easily mark me as involuntary; which would go on my record and stay with me permanently. I eventually cave in and begin taking anti-depressants. 

A week goes by, and treatment was kind of unnecessary in my opinion but some of the other ""patients"" in there were social/other students. I am released and go back to campus and begin to email my professors. I meet with the Dean of students who informs me what the doctor's told me was not true. The power to make the decision on whether I could make up work was up to the department. I was also told to take the rest of the week off and next week too if needed. Almost all were understanding of my situation and gave me options on how I could make up work. But the biology department on the other hand was not. I had an exam 2 days from my release date. I missed over a week of classes with no access to study materials and was told I still had to take the exam. 

I took the exam, I failed. I emailed the Dean to explain the situation and see if he could exert his influence in anyway. No response. I felt myself being very lethargic and was given no instruction on how to end medication. I'm an idiot and stopped taking them right away.

I’m always very suspicious that someone is out to get me or may use something I’ve told them against me in the future. This ranges from my girlfriend, friends, colleagues, acquaintances to complete strangers. 

I’ve worried before in the past that someone is going to come to my house and beat me up for something I did years ago, despite seeing them around from time to time, people recording my conversations with them on their phones to spread about something private I may have been discussing, cars following me home, people planting tracking devices on my car, people trying to sabotage my career, offering me food that could be laced with something. There’s many more that don’t spring to mind right now. Writing them all down makes them seem so ridiculous but when I have my bouts of paranoia I convince myself that that’s the about truth.

I have no idea which way to turn to try and alleviate this. I feel I can’t confide in anyone as I’m risking humiliation at some point in the future. It’s something I’ve kind of learnt to deal with and doesn’t particularly get in the way of me living my life fully. But when I go through bouts of paranoia it can be absolute torture. 

I have also struggled very badly with hypochondria in the past. And I am still susceptible to having bouts of that, but not as frequent as it use to be.

75,From everything I have been reading about suicides lately (Bourdain...) it seems people impulsively just do it sometimes. This is terrifying! Do people who are mostly healthy and balanced become overcome by suicidal thoughts to the point they just can’t help themselves? Is this something I should be afraid could happen to me or someone I know (serious question)? I’ve read that like half of people are not even mentally ill. Is it really like you just can’t stop? ,14Jun2018,1,

77,Every time I google this I end up with poor results. I just want to be able to say I have x behavior vs telling a long story where as I’m sure there’s a word for what I’m doing ,14Jun2018,1,
