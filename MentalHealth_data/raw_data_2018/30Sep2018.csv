0,"Hey guys, so I used to go to a therapist but he was rather new and I didn't feel much improvement so I decided to quit visiting him but I am recently finding out that he has given me strange diagnosis by taking what I said and misunderstanding and exaggerating it. I found it very odd because there were very little *symptoms* to my diagnostic. Is there a way to avoid or deal with this? It wasn't a particularly bad one but I'm kinda disappointed that he'd diagnose me just like that because maybe my therapy was trying to fix non existent issues ",30Sep2018,2
1,"Hello Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I just woke up from a nightmare and need to calm my mind so here I am. I've been dealing with the more or less exact same dream for years now: I'd be up to doing whatever (sometimes I'm alone, sometimes I'm not) while it's dark outside and out of nowhere a hideous creature (it always looks different) would pop up and scream into my face, resulting in me waking up in terror, covered in sweat and my heart racing. I'd be terrified and have to calm myself down by turning on the lights and surfing the net for some time or reading a book. Whenever this happens once, I know for sure that it'll probably happen the next day. I somehow manifested it into my brain already and I'd ""sense"" something scary or bad whenever I find myself in the same, dark setting, immediately waking up before the creature can appear but I'd still be horrified afterwards and have to take a breather for half an hour. This can get extremely annoying and frustrating since it's messing alot with my sleeping pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I know exactly where these dreams are coming from and I always feel like the dreams are extremely silly after I calmed down and slept it through. When I was about 4 or 5 years old my older brother showed my a picture of a room asking me whether I can spot something wrong. All of a sudden a face of someone who was possessed or something appeared overlayed with a high-pitched scream. Of course, as young as I was, I almost crapped my pants and started crying. Now this has been 16 years ago and I'm still not over it. I'm still extremely cautious about any shady Youtube videos with a low view count because, well, it could be a screamer. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's honestly such a stupid thing to be scared of but it haunts me in my dreams and doesn't let me sleep. Could this be PTSD? Should I seek out professional help? I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety some time ago and I've been a lot better already but the dreams still won't disappear.  If anyone has a similar experience, how do or did you deal with it?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting a little sleepy so I'll try to sleep again. Thank you for everyone who read this mess, it's probably all over the place haha

But now that I’ve gotten to where I wanted to be I don’t find joy and excitement in working to get to the next place. I feel stuck. It’s really effecting my mental health because I know that I can do it, I just can’t seem to find the motivation anymore... has anyone gone through anything like this?",30Sep2018,1

It has been making me depressed, and I want to go see a therapist to try to fix it but I am worried it'll be really weird and out of the ordinary and a therapist wouldn't be able to help me. Also is a therapist going to talk about what happened in my meeting outside of it? Because this is something that's really private and I'm hoping everything I mention about it stays in that room. Are my fears valid?",30Sep2018,6
7,"I’ve had a lot going on lately. I up and quit a job, started back at an old one, I started a new relationship, I became an RA at my school, and this is my senior year. I’m graduating a year early. I have no idea what I want to do, especially with my major. I’m going to be 20 with my bachelors degree. All of these things sound great but they’re tearing me up. Being an RA has left me so alone. I just ended a close friendship today and I don’t have many others. 

Anyway, with everything going on, I get this overwhelming feeling of anxiety and fear. I feel lost and alone wherever I am, even with my friends, significant other, and family. It comes in waves and hits me like a bus. I get so hot and overwhelmed. I’m not quite sure what to do or how to cope with it. I was hoping for some advice if there were things I could do to help or even tell me what it is. I feel like I’m almost at the verge of a breakdown everyday. ",30Sep2018,2

9,"Not sure what the best way to start this off is, or even really what’s wrong with me or if this the right place to ask for help. But I know something is really off with my brain. I can feel emotions and empathy, but am completely blank on the outside. Horrible situations bring no obvious change in behavior, good ones either. I don’t react to much of anything.

I have an extremely difficult time getting to know people or making small talk. There’s an extremely heavy weight associated with any kind of communication that has no real meaning. Customer service brings instant panic attacks, I simply just can’t handle them anymore.

I have an estranged connection with my parents, because we have no morality or interests in common. We don’t have the same drives. I can’t talk to them because I’m so odd. Dad used to be pretty explosive on anger, and Mom has very particular ticks and plays the manipulative pity game. They love me, but in kind of a weird toxic way. I’m their son, and by extension, that’s where all of their emotional connection is. They don’t like anything I do, or any of my talents, or how left leaning I am (small community). I always felt smothered and forced into a specific personality because they didn’t like mine. So I ended up being this blank slate.

I once left the state for a year to go figure out who I was inside. I have identity issues that make me question what I actually believe or what my personality traits are. I discovered traits of addiction, but also so much more about myself. I felt genuine passionate connections with peers and a very obvious disconnect from the last generation. I was better at piano, I talked, and I didn’t talk to my parents because there was nothing beneath their surface I could love. 

They sent state police after me and became overwhelmingly emotional with my absence, often leaving vague passive aggressive comments to my friend and traveling companion. A separate time I very plainly asked for my space (I was 3000 miles away) and my dad called me a politician and threatened to kill my dog.

I feel... not okay. But the community is small here, I don’t make a lot of money, and I truly wish I could be properly examined by a psychiatrist. I have weird emotional voids from weird irrational behavior. I can’t concentrate on anything and am closing up socially at a rate I find alarming ",30Sep2018,2

11,"Its been quite a roller coaster for me this past year and a half. Aside from all the things that has caused me to feel all these emotions at once, i applied to prehealth at a college to make my way into nursing. Its been a big change since ive always been professionally cooking the last 3 years. Im finally doing something ive always wanted to do. I always had a plan to someday become a nurse and I’m finally sticking to it. 
If youre taking the prehealth program(8months), the only way to become a registered nurse is to either: 
Option 1: graduate pre health at college a and apply for a practical nursing program(2 years) and finish that with 75% or higher then, apply for the bridging program(4months) and then apply to the rn program(4 years) - with this option, you can only apply to colleges within the gta, no universities because they dont allow prehealth students into their program( idk why ) .
Option2: graduate prehealth(8months) apply to two universities that are high rated and that accept post grad pre health students to apply for the rn program (4 years) both universities are 2 hours away. 
I plan to go with option two because I believe its a better choice for many reasons.

I told my mother today what i plan on doing since we have to apply for university and colleges before feb 2019. She told me”no” and got angry at me, shook her head and sighed. And i told her, why is she not being supportive on what i plan to do? She yelled saying that im accusing her. I told her all the information she needs to know on the next steps. And she tells me no without reason and then ignores me instead of taking to me about it so i can walk her through it again. 
How am I truly supposed to feel about this? I never had the best grAdes in highschool or culinary school because I didnt bother trying. And now that im doing so much hard work my grades are in the high 80’s. I truly believe she has no hope for me. No hope meaning she thinks ill fail and waste money even though she wont be paying for my school or housing. 
She told me during culinary (when i wanted to go to the best school in canada) “dont go outside the city, its only for university “ now that i plan on doing that she is saying no to it. 
So really, how am i supposed to feel? what should i do? 
I feel lost, and broken because I dont have my mothers support on something im wanting to do. 
I dont ask much from her. I live on my own, im responsible. It doesnt seem fair that i feel like she doesn’t believe I can do this.

12,"I tend to go through motions of one minute I am fine and the next I am having breakdowns. 

Mega breakdowns where my anxiety and depression kick in and I can't control my emotions or think straight.

Due to the unpredictability of it all, it can interfere with my day to day life. It is mainly when I have something planned and I get myself worked up about it. Even things I want to do.

I know I am not very good at dealing with my stress well and it has a knock on effect, for example if I am running late for something, I'll get overly stressed (which is normal), but then my emotions will run high, to the point where I will break down crying, can't do anything right and the anxiety and depression goes through the roof. I will have very dramatic reactions to things that would not really be a big deal if I dealt with them right. But once in that mood, I am unable to make decisions (at least the right ones anyway). 

Today was one of those days. I had work to go to. I woke up not wanting to go in. It instantly brought my depression along. I think I would have been okay if I had the day to myself as I wasn't feeling too great and just wanted to relax on my own and have a bath! It took all my energy and efforts to bring myself to get ready. For a moment, I was proud of myself for doing so, but time was ticking, I hadn't eaten all day and basically had nothing the day before. I didn't get a good rest either. I am fed up of abandoning all my basic needs in order to function. (I was assigned as an outpatient at the hospital because my lack of food had gotten that bad). I am trying to rush to do it all, prioritising just to eat something as I would have hours to go. I also take my brother to work with me, so I have the responsibility of getting him there too. Mum and dad were getting on at me to get myself together, which wasn't helping. I could feel the tension.

&amp;#x200B;

I work front of house, so I always try to be presentable. I honestly was fine but when my depression kicks in I just feel not good enough and I look in the mirror and see all my flaws - even after I have attempted to do myself up. It gives me self-esteem issues and knowing I am going into a sociable environment, where I have to act confident, I don't like to leave the house until I feel good about myself. If anyone has had this, you'll know how hard it is to get yourself out of the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I buck up the courage to go and time I'll get there, I'll be fine - it is a good half an hour drive away. Except I knew we were going to be a bit late after all this drama and I didn't have a real reason to give. I was just feeling shitty, overly stressed, depressed and anxious. I know it wasn't mild either because I even drove all the way there. Stopped the car down the road, got out of it and pondered what to do. I literally was having a mental breakdown in the street. I don't really want people knowing what I'm like, but in that moment, I did. Because in my eyes that is a valid reason of why I am being how I am. In my head I was so depressed, I had picked up my passport before I left encase I got really bad and wanted to get away. That's when I know I am really down. When I don't care for prepping or packing or telling anyone. I just want to get out of there. Even though logically running away is only going to cause more problems, not solve them. I half wanted to crash my car. Suicidal thoughts were creeping in. I was just in  a horrible head space, definitely not fit for work. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother was next to me in the car the whole time and we spend ages trying to decide what is best to do.Shall we just lie and make an excuse up. ""Man up"" and go in, just suck up the comments on lateness and in 5 minutes it will be over (looking back, this was probably the best bet, but I was so fragile, I knew I would break down at anything personal) or tell the truth because I am fed up of pretending everything is okay and it is not. Finally I opted for the last one because I thought employers have a duty of care. I was driving so my brother called up and tried to explain the issue. Exaggerated it a bit because I don't feel my reason sounds ""good enough"". Even though clearly it is quite a big thing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The response was not what I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, I'm not after a load of sympathy, just understanding. I got neither but the wrath of the boss's tongue. He was swearing down the phone at us. I don't want to be like this. Do you really think we wanted to make that phone call. It took a lot of my strength to let's just come out with the fact I am not coping right now. And his heartless words almost pushed me to the edge. He just confirmed to me how cold hearted the world is. I do try. I don't mean to fuck people over. I don't mean to be so useless. 

I called out of desperation. I didn't know what to do. 

Anyway the way it has been left I am on verge of loosing my job. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if he messaged not to come back or sack me in person on my next day that I'm due in. Which after today I have decided to leave anyway. Maybe that was the push I needed. But I am fed up of burning my bridges. All I wanted was to leave on good terms, yet here I am. 

I know there is no point in dwelling on it, it is not going to change anything now. But I can't help it. I was upset anyway. And now I am really upset after that phone call. 

I don't know what to do, nor what to think. How do I fix this? I am so angry at him for making me feel like not even a person. Just someone to put money in his pocket and who cares what else happens. I never had him down like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surely there is something against swearing and demeaning employees.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for such a long post, I was just trying to put everything into perspective a bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

Has something similar happened to you before?

What would you do?

14,"I had the greatest weekend. Our son was away for 2 nights and we had the whole weekend to ourselves.
Friday we went bowling, we met friends for drinks, we ordered pizza and drank beer when we got home. Today we went to the Newbridge Museum to see the Kurt Cobain exhibition. I'm a huge Nirvana fan. We got lunch, we went shopping. He bought me a watch and 2 pairs of boots as an early birthday present. When we got home we had a couple of gins and watched a movie.
Then bam... Out of nowhere, anxiety attack. We are trying for a baby, so I'm weaning myself off my medication. I got jealous over nothing and lost control. First anxiety attack in almost a year.
We fought and I spent 40 minutes blaming him. For not handling my anxiety attack. For not being there for me. I told him (my husband) he couldn't possibly be my soul mate because if he was he would understand me and know how to help me.
I thought that he was letting me down by not being there for me and arguing with me during a time when I really needed him.
Fucking hell.
Then it hit me.
I'm expecting him to understand and empathise with a feeling, an emotion, he has absolutely no comprehension of. He's supposed to know how to act, what to say, what not to say. And if he doesn't, he's not there for me???
Shit. He's still here. He's still trying to help, and love through it all. He's a diamond. He's stuck with me, knowing this will happen a million times over.
Anxiety sufferers are strong.
But the ones who support us through it are equally strong, but nobody bigs them up and encourages them through it. It's expected.
Hell no.
We couldn't do it without you. Thank you for sticking with us. Helping us. Taking our shit!!!
You're choosing to fight against an evil you will never understand for someone you love.
Thank you xxx
TL;DR we can expect too much from those who support us through anxiety and its just as hard on them. The big difference is they don't have to live with it, but they choose to because they love us. ",30Sep2018,4
15,"- I don’t feel particularly shy, but I just usually don’t speak in group situations. People often call me quiet and tell me I should speak more, but I don’t feel like I have anything of value to say, and imagine the group just kinda being like ‘um, yeah’ in response to anything I say and my comment even killing the whole flow of the conversation. So I just sit and listen silently. It’s not like I feel anxious... but I think that could be because I’m not even trying to talk, I’ve just kind of accepted that I just listen. Although it makes me feel worthless to the group, because I’m adding nothing, which I feel bad about. Which leads on to point 2:

- I struggle to believe that my friends actually value me. I think they think relatively positively/at least neutral towards me, but I just don’t believe that my presence adds any value at all, even though they invite me to things and randomly say quite nice things about me (and internally I’m wondering ‘is this sarcasm...?’). I actually even struggle to call them ‘my friends’, and often refer to them as ‘my boyfriend’s friends’, which most of them were originally. 

- this friend group is quite close, and I wish so bad that I had friends that I was close to like that, yet I’m not very good at accepting their attempts to include me. I often turn down invitations to go out (to be fair it’s to do uni work, but I could be trying harder to get through the work so I can see them) and even tho they do speak highly of me I struggle to believe they value me. 

- I am very close to one person tho, which is my boyfriend. I have tended to do that over the last few years particularly: get very close to one person and struggle to connect to anyone else. I can kind of see that there are people who would like to be my friend and are even actively trying to be my friend, but I always feel like there is this barrier separating me from truly feeling comfortable with them, that only my boyfriend is currently within. 


So that’s just turned into a long ramble/vent.
Maybe it’s just introversion. Idk. 
Can people relate? 
Is this what everyone feels? 
Advice? 
Similar experiences?

16,"I'm sick of this. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder back in September last year and had put me on Divalproex Sodium (Sodium Valproate), Risperidone and recently Wellbutrin. These medications have destroyed me, I no longer feel any joy in any of my ""passions""(if you can even call them that now). I have no energy, I'm exhausted. I can't think straight nor can I even remember anything anymore. My memory has gotten so bad that I'll forget what I'm talking about mid conversation. I've gained so much weight too as I used to be really healthy and went to the gym everyday for at least 2 hours. Now I don't even have the willpower to go anymore and have put on 30 pounds in the past year. My jeans had literally ripped because of this. Nothing makes any sense to me anymore, I've went to school for one semester and even though I'm paying attention I won't be able to understand even the basic concepts, I won't even be able to concentrate as my mind goes off elsewhere. Despite feeling exhausted, I feel restless at the same time. I can't sit still and I always have to move my legs or the tension because unbearable. Even writing this is difficult. I keep losing my train of thought and I can't even think coherently about what I want to tell you guys.


I had an appointment with my psychiatrist today and finally told him all this, what does he do? He decides to take me off risperidone. Thank god. But then after he told me that, he then went and prescribed me olanzapine. He didn't tell me any of the side effects or anything about it, just said ""I'll give you this new medication, try it out and tell me in 4 weeks."" that's all. So I get home and decide to search all the side effects before filling the prescription(I have no money to get it anyways) and lo and behold its even worse than risperidone! The weight gain and drowsiness is even worse on that from what I saw. This pissed me off. Yeah it might make my memory and concentration issue better, but to be honest I have never had an episode of even hypomania in the past year and a half. I don't think I even have bipolar to begin with.

to be honest I think it may just be depression and maybe adhd/add but i don't know I'd have to see a different psychiatrist for that. I've always been sad and feeling worthless ever since a traumatic event that happened 5 years ago. I'm over it now but there are some scars still. I've only been able to hold one job, but that was because I got myself into debt, and luckily had gotten out of debt, but after my mental breakdown in 2017 I was never really able to hold a job for more than 3 months. and even then I'd be a terrible worker as I'd call in sick constantly because of the pain I felt daily. I went through 5 jobs in the span of 3 months. 


So I'm gonna go to the doctor this monday to get a referral for a different psychiatrist, and I'm gonna try to go to group counseling, as I've had no therapy during my treatment. Luckily this is all covered under the provincial health plan here in manitoba canada. But I don't wanna wait any longer. I'm tired of being a zombie.

I just needed to vent but if anyone has any advice they'd like to give feel free.

And of course it cant be perfectly defined everything is different for everyone but...I dont want to be like this and not have it be for a reason. 

Ive always had bouts of not being able to sleep, lately its been really crazy. Either I cant fall asleep or I cant stay asleep, I have all these intrusive thoughts or my mind just cant stop racing and I know when those nights are going to happen its almost like I feel a buzzing in the core of my brain. I am tired, this isnt because Im not getting exercise, my work is labor intensive I work my butt off 6 days a week..I sweat, my body hurts, i need rest for the next day. I worry Im not going to get enough sleep. 

Lately I keep conciously swallowing, i keep producing too much spit and i cant stop thinking about it, my throat goes dry. I cant rest when im trying to. 

Social situations are getting better, groups are easier to navigate but being around a small group of 2-4 in a small room. I really wanna shut down. Eye contact unnerves me. 

I have a lot of problems with insecurity Im pretty sure Im on the BPD spectrum. Im really ashamed of my past behaviors (threatning to throw myself from cars, on train tracks, raging, hiting myself, just generally feeling overwhelmed and of course trying to manipulate people around me thru these actions.) Ive come a long way from doing these things I can check myself and regulate now and its been amazing for all of my relationships but something shitty lingers in the back of my head and im scared ill revert back or show that side again.

I'm screaming at them the whole time to do what they're supposed to do instead. It doesn't work. The whole time, they think of justifications as to what they're doing in the moment that is in reality lazy, while simultaneously I'm self-aware that it's actually just me being lazy and so I am also berating myself for it.

The reality of it is I feel like I can't relax. Nothing is ever enough. All problems are bigger than they actually are. And at the end of the day I want to sleep more than I want to solve one more problem. If I'm allowed to ""decompress"" for long enough, I actually bounce back and work harder than anyone else. People notice. Then I begin to slow down, and disappoint again. Eventually I tend to just burn out on things, jobs, relationships, totally and completely.

I can be not-lazy at work if I'm only working about 30 hours per week (with 3-day weekends), which isn't economically viable.

Anything more than that, and I'm not only lazy at work, but my ability to care for my personal self, home, or attend my social life completely disintegrates, and I disappoint everyone.

24,"Due to a couple of things that happend tonight i need to tell someone how i feel.
First of all, english is not my main language so im sorry for any grammar mistakes.

The thing is that have a fiance and few friends but i cant talk to anyone how i feel. Everyone i know is asleep at this hour but i really need to get this out so thats why i turn to reddit this time.

Im in my mid 20's and i've been struggling with my mental health for many years now. Panic attacks, anxiety and depression has been a part of my life for so long now that im starting to get used to it.
But these last months has been so hard to cope with. Im having these catastrophic thoughts that my life is basically going straight to hell.
I live in medium size town with my fiance that i love more than anything else and our cat that i also love so much. I have a nice job with good pay and i really like our life in this town but im so scared that i might lose all this.
I guess it starts with my fiance, theres something in her behavior sometimes that feels like she doesnt give a shit about me. It doesnt happen that often but when it does it leaves a scar in my soul and it hurts so much. Im so afraid that she might wake up one day and everything she felt for me would be gone, erased and a memory. 
As i write right now im thinking about this and i cant stop crying because i would not only lose her but my whole life as it is right now. This is not my hometown so couldnt stay here, i would quit my job, move to my parents, never meet my cat again and i would be so alone.

These last weeks have been the hardest of my life. I dont enjoy anything, my friends ignore my calls and texts and i tried talking to my fiance but she doesnt understand when i explain.  It has gone so far that im having these suicidal thoughts and im starting to lose grip of my life.

Im sorry for this long text but i hope someone can recognize my thoughts and feelings because everyday is a pain to get through.

25,"I'm in a weird place.

This is a anniversary of the when I left my husband give or take a couple days. Chilling on the couch catching up on some Bojack. Been an interesting year for my state of mind. At first it was painful, normal breakup emotions. Then it was exhilarating, followed by a steady decline to the perpetual blah that I'm in now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My STBX was bad for me, in spite of the lack of respect for boundaries, physical abuse, and toxicity if some one had told me a year ago that leaving him would be the best decision I've ever made I wouldn't have believed it. Leaving him was hard, that last goodbye at the airport seeing the pain in his eyes crying all the way there. Tack on the major set back of crawling back to my parents for the second time in my life with nothing to offer the world. No skills, no money, 3 years without work experience, I hit rock bottom again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I get home, I cry a lot and then less and less, I talk to my family, I got a neat job, and I got over it. In fact instead of sad I got angry, living away from the bullshit, remembering what life without abuse is like gave me clarity. I cut off contact, moved out of my parents house, rebound dated a guy (it didn't work out (long story short I met my first heroin addict)), left rebound guy. I felt like I was kicking ass though, I was finally doing my own thing, I was free, I was sorry not sorry. It was like a kick of adrenaline. I was studying, working, living on my own, motivated, and optimistic. No surprise it didn't last, it never does. 

&amp;#x200B;

It happens every time I try to do something excited for like when I went to college or joined the military, then the blah hits I get all suicidal, unproductive, and unpredictable. Now its happening again, this time it feels different, less dramatic. I've become an old hat at this, no crying, no cutting, no playing out my own suicide. I guess this is what numb feels like. It really hit me a couple of weeks ago when I received a gift and I felt nothing. My apartment got broken into, and my family came together and helped me out they sent me money, my uncle bought me a laptop to replace the one that got stolen, and they offered me a job and great deal on rent in a place that I want to move to. A moment that should have made me super happy and I didn't feel anything aside from a bit of anxiety because I had to quickly act excited. I took the deal and I'm definitely looking forward to moving so I can get away from my parents on a cognitive level but emotionally there's nothing there. I'd do anything some for anticipatory giddiness right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is because I already know whats going to happen, it's either going to suck immediately or it's going to suck later when the blah comes back. I'm so tired, I feel like I'm just going day by day, no direction, no reason to live, no passion. I don't want anything, I don't want friends, I don't want help, well I do want one thing I want to move because I'm chasing the proverbial dragon. I need the high again, so I have to motivation to get a better job and hopefully someday I can make enough money to finally be alone where I can wait out my time, indulge in escapism, until I finally die because I'm too chickenshit to get it over with. I just hope it works. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having just typed that out, is just... that can't possibly be what I want to do with my life. I don't even know. I don't want to think about it, I've been stuck on ""what do I want to do?"" for so fucking long I'm sick of thinking about it. My brain is an asshole, not enough motivation to live or die, just stuck existing. ",30Sep2018,2
26,"Some nights I'll be so anxious and terrified because my mind has convinced me that every bump and shuffle is a demon or something from a scary video game that's now trying to kill me, I'll close my eyes for a few seconds before they're prayed open by my own fear. It's only been happening after I moved to another continent from my parents for school, but never as frequently as it has been after I spent the summer at home, infact it's currently 5am and I've holed up in the bathroom with my laptop. It happened occasionally last year, my first year away from home, but very rarely. I don't even know why it's happening but I just want to get it solved so my brain will let me sleep.  
After I did a bunch of thinking i thought about how as a child my mother would accompany me in bed so I wouldn't be afraid at night, that of course didn't continue into my teen years but I'd always feel safe being in the same apartment, which I guess means that my mind is doing this because I'm homesick, but then...now what? What do I even do now to let my brain let me sleep?

27,"I was seeing this girl for a couple of months but I moved across the country recently. After I moved, she called me and broke down crying, saying she's feeling suicidal and worthless. Though when we were together she seemed mostly fine, maybe even happy sometimes, but apparently she has been depressed for as long as she remembers.

Anyways I tried to comfort her and told her to call me anytime she feels this way. She's had them about 3 times now and I've been trying to not just comfort her, but to help her get better so maybe one day she could be happy. The origin of her problems seem to be from her low self-esteem/worthlessness.

I know that I should but I don’t know what to expect at all and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t feel like I can trust anyone anymore, I feel hopeless and tired. I constantly feel sick to my stomach because I feel anxious in every situation ever. the moment I wake up I hate existing. Going to school is extremely hard. Often if I do go to school, I end up being sent back home bc I feel like throwing up or I have a panic attack and they have to send me home.

It didn't reach a painful level of force, but it was annoying as it lasted for about an hour. This has continued on and off since then, but today it jumped in severity. I started beating my head and face with my fists. I have a black eye and several large welts and bruises. I don't know what to do, how to stop this, or if it's even part of my anxiety.

31,"Okay so maybe “hate” is a strong word in some cases for a few family members, but I’ve definitely been alienated from my family and I’m definitely not welcomed most of the time. My own twin sister feels no love for me and I know this is partially my fault but at the same time I am well aware of the fact I have made my amends with her and she is the one who has not moved on. 

For background purposes, I am a 19 y/o female with a twin sister and an older brother who is 26. My parents divorced around 14/15 years ago. Their divorce was pretty messy and they are not in good terms still. I’ve suffered from a lot of mental health issues stemming from verbal and emotional abuse from my father; neglect and emotional abuse from my mother; sexual abuse from an unknown man in early childhood; I was molested by my female neighbor in elementary school; I developed anorexia, intense depression and anxiety and began self harming at age 14 and was hospitalized at age 15; I was assaulted by a friend I met at the hospital at age 15; left public school and went to a therapeutic high school; my mom couldn’t care for me with my emotional needs so I then went to a group home for my junior and senior years of high school; went to college in the summer right after graduation where I was assaulted again at age 18; entered eating disorder rehab for three months from ages 18-19 and have been coping ever since. I am back in a new school and am currently attending part time and commuting. 

This is where my trouble comes in. Home life is incredibly difficult. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and that takes a huge toll on me but my mother and I do not get along at all. We are always at odds. My sister is typically away at school but when she is not she sides with my mom and they gang up on me. My brother lives states away from us but he is visiting this weekend (as is my sister) so they are all ganging up on me. They make me feel small and selfish and rude and mean. They treat me like I’m incompetent and like I’m an inconvenience and like I’m the biggest loser to ever come across them. My brother is the nicest as he can be nice and does try to be and tries to look out for me but when it comes down to it he’s always going to side with my mom. 

Meanwhile my dad severely triggers my PTSD as for some reason he is a very sexual person (not towards me) but is always making sexual comments towards women and it’s so off putting. He also triggered me awfully the other day and just. I don’t know. And he also always makes everything about him like if I’m on my phone he takes it as if I’m mad at him when I’m literally just texting someone or am on Facebook. Like how am I mad at him? Or if I sigh or readjust how I’m sitting in the car he takes that as me being mad at him. He takes everything very personally and I can’t do anything right with him. And he demands I text him back right when he texts me and I just don’t do that. I have other stuff to do. But then he gets really angry and offended. But then he will play victim and be all sad. It’s just so infuriating. 

The only family members I truly feel love me unconditionally are my grandparents but they are not doing well and I barely see them. They live a little ways away and it’s hard to see them due to costs of travel and hotel. Their heath is not good either as my grandfather is 96 and my grandmother is 83 and just suffered a stroke. She was in the ER yesterday but left today. I was supposed to go visit with them last weekend but due to a mix up with her memory where she cancelled the visit (and then forgot she cancelled it) I was not able to go see them and now I feel awful that I did not go even though it was neither of our faults. 


My life is just unraveling and I don’t remember there being a moment where it’s been okay and I’m scared it will never be. I’m hopelessly lost. I’ve just got no control in any aspect of my life and I just want to curl up and wish all the pain away. ",30Sep2018,2

I'm a teenager who has skin that is sometime drier than optimal levels. I live in a cold climate, so the skin by my hands often get irritated. I involuntarily scratch at it sometimes, and this eventually leads to scabs on my hands. 

I am very self conscious about how these look, so I have tried everything to cover these in public, from stretching long sleeved shirts to wearing gloves to wrist watches. 

Now here's the problem. I am not always able to cover them up because our mandatory gym strip is a half sleeve t-shirt, so I pick my scabs off. They grow back eventually, I pick them, and the cycle continues. This has been happening for almost three years and it feels like it will never end. Even when the doctor says not to put a band aid on it so the wound can breathe, I still do and it just gets worse and worse. 

I don't know what to do.",30Sep2018,7
35,"Hello y'all ! 

I'm a bit lost at this point, I'm french and I've been diagnosed with checking OCD and rOCD which is a form of OCD that latches onto relationships with a lot of intrusive thoughts that can be really triggering. I've been struggling with rOCD since I began dating people and being involved in serious relationships but I only put a name on it 3  months ago when things were going real bad.  


I know for the sake of my therapy I shouldn't reassure myself by going onto forums and by asking advice, but It's rather an outlook I want from you guys.

So, I feel since I began struggling with OCD that i'm dissociated or depersonalized, it's really difficult for me to feel things, to feel love even (recurring things amongst rOCD sufferers) but also to think things are real;   
This year I've graduated, applied to one of the best MSc in my area, met my current boyfriend, passed a driving licence and so on... but it's like I didn't do any of those things, that I'm not aware of my accomplishments. That those things aren't real/true and that i'm living on autopilot. 

I talked to my therapist about that and she recommended some mindfulness exercises, which I am doing, but I want more insights about this issue, I'm stuggling so much about this, I feel like a robot.

I want an outlook on this, I don't know if it's really dissociation or depersonalization, and I don't know how to cope with it, my next appointment with my therapist is in a long time, and I don't know what to do right now besides mindfulness exercises.

I gnaw on my fingers until they bleed. I have long curly hair so you can't see that I have scabs and probably scars all over my head, I started both of these compulsions around age 12. I also have Compulsive Eating Disorder, it has gotten pretty bad probably the last 6 years, I used to have Bulimia as well but I was able to over come that when I saw I was starting to harm my teeth. 

The hard part is, maybe you can understand but I feel like I'm failing by wanting to talk to someone, I've prayed about this for years and it has not gone away, my husband doesn't know that I actually eat the roots of my hair when they come out. He does know about everything else and also listens when I need to talk and prays for me about it. I just feel like there's so much I need to work out.

40,"Cliffnotes version-My best  friend Fernando* has had really horrible luck with friendships- they've all been toxic and destructive, leaving Fernando scarred and insecure. On top of that, he has been increasingly depressed. 
He's always been introverted so maybe it isn't that big a deal- but as for ASD.. he's sensitive to light and sound, gets anxious in loud places, has an erratic sleep schedule, is picky when it comes to food, says he thinks in shapes and other dimensional colours..(which I understand can be traits of ASD). He doesn't seem to like change, either.

I'm his only in-person friend. My own mental health is garbage, so I personally cannot do much without feeling overwhelmed. But I don't know how to help him.

41,"I am writing here to seek for your advice regarding how to treat or act around someone who is depressed. Just a little background, I am a socially awkward person who really doesn’t have any friends and don’t really enjoy socialising with people that I am comfortable talking to. I know posting this will show how shallow I am as a person thus I need your help in understanding it.

That someone is my co-worker. When he first started working, he was really nice and did not talk much, just how I like it. Though I am not too comfortable talking to him, I used to don’t mind making small conversations with him. However, I think he started to get too comfortable with me (e.g. hug me, lay on my hand). I hate physical touch with someone who I’m not comfortable with. However, I went along with it because I know that he has a depression and is on the road to recovery. He also start to get very comfortable with my other co-workers. He also texted me outside work regarding how happy he is that everyone has been so nice with him. However, I started to get sick of it because I really don’t like the physical touch and texts outside work so I started to avoid his initial for physical touch and he realises it. Though he stop initiating (which I appreciate) it obviously become a let down to him.

Then we had a farewell gathering for a co-worker who is going to leave town for good thus we are going to have drink in town after work. He was invited as well. However since he has different job title than us, he finishes work a little bit later than us. We planned to meet at 10.30 and normally he finishes work at 11. We created an event page saying that he’s going however all of a sudden he changed it into ‘maybe’. Then he posted on the page saying that he might not be going because he says he will finish at 11. In the back of my mind, I thought to myself that he always could come after his shift since we are planning to drink and for sure won’t leave at 11. When the D-day has come, some of my co-workers pass our workplace on the way to bar and sees him crying on the floor from outside. So they went inside to console him. He cried because he is sad that he couldn’t make it. So my co-workers decided to stay back to help him finish up his work so that he could come with us.

This is the part that I will never understand about him and I need some insight from you. Why does he think that he won’t be able to join us when he clearly can after work? Why does he have to make my co-workers stay back to help him making the rest of them extremely late as well?

For almost a year now, I was stricken with debilitating, life altering panic attacks. They literally make me feel like I'm dying. I'm easily irritable, I'm jumpy, I'm scared, I'm on edge. I've become hypersensitive to literally everything -- feelings, touch, sound, taste, and pain. 

These panic attacks grew to be so terrible and debilitating that I've developed severe hypochondria. They started out as feeling like a heart attack. Sweats, chest pain, arm pain, shortness of breath. After that was settled from several hospital visits and cardiologists explaining my heart is fine, I started becoming convinced I had other dangerous illnesses and my anxiety will mimic the symptoms of whatever my brain is telling me I have almost to a T. 

I've been to psychiatrists and I'm in therapy, I'm on medication, I've quit drinking caffeine entirely, I started exercising regularly and changed my diet, and nothing has helped. 

This has made me feel even more suicidal than I have in the past. Its getting to the point where I actually want these panic attacks to kill me, because then I won't have to f***ing live like this.

52,"Howdy Redditos,

For the past 18 months or so I have been training my body using a free weight program four to five times a week for about an hour each workout. Through consistency with this training I have experienced an exceptional change in strength and physique. As someone who has wrestled with mental fitness for decades, this has me wondering: what is the mental equivalent to using a workout program? I'm not talking about therapy, which I have years of experience with and no longer feel the need to pursue. What I'm looking for is a program or series of programs designed for mental fitness in the same way there are many tried-and-true programs of physical fitness. 

I realize that playing a musical instrument and/or disciplines in the realms of math and science help with mental fitness. Unfortunately I am adept at neither. I have some experience with meditation, which I am making a concerted effort to return to consistently. The ""brain games"" I have experienced so far (Lumosity, et al) feel more like jumping in on basketball games in the park rather than a system to use to establish strength, stamina, and mobility of the mind. Indeed some people feel playing pickup games of basketball are enough to keep them in shape, but I know myself better.

I doubt anybody will even read this, but here goes.

Ever since I was a little girl in primary school, I never really had friends. I'm not sure why, I just never fit in. I don't think it majorly affected me much until I was around 10. I began having panic attacks in class and during my martial arts classes which I used to attend, and had stopped because of it. I had been doing it for 3 years and had 3 belts, but I thought that I wasn't good enough and that everyone else was watching me and judging me. I broke down in my classes because I felt like nobody cared about me. I remember one day I walked into my classroom with a new haircut I had just got the day before, a bob, which I had wanted for a while. I instantly broke down because I felt ugly, and that everyone was judging me. I began spending more of my time crying in the toilets at break times. 

Behind all of this, my parents had divorced when I was 5. We were never a rich family, always low-middle class. My dad had always been my friend instead of my parent, and would treat me more, he would also have more in-depth conversations with me. My brother was born around this time. After a long court-case between my parents was finished, my brother and I hadn't seen my dad for 3 years. We began living with our dad half the week. The reason why I'm mentioning this is because of how much my dad had changed. In short, he always seemed the perfect father to everyone, and he was such an honorable man for raising 2 kids on the benefit. Us kids always bought pristine lunches to school and were generally tidy looking, nobody suspecting a thing. At home, he would always talk about how much he hated my mother, how much the court failed him, how much the government were a bunch of assholes for not raising benefits. He used to get so angry, it got so bad, and I was brainwashed to hate my mother. He used change so easily, it was hard because you'd never know when he'd change. His life also became increasingly overcome by his interest in aliens and god. He always used to talk about how brainless people were, and how they're so infatuated with their daily lives, and not focusing on the heavens like we were made to.  I heard it every single day, for around 6 years. He eventually began threatening to kill himself because of our poor living conditions, and that he was sick of being alone. He was very anti-social. 

In 2015 I was 11/12. My situation at school had worsened, I still had no friends and I would spend all my interval and lunch breaks in the bathrooms, locked in a toilet stall cutting myself. I used to cut myself between classes and let the blood soak my shirt, I remember the satisfaction I had from it. I also was starving myself and struggled with body-image issues. 2016 was a little better, when I had made a couple new friends. We didn't have a deep friendship, we just used to send memes to each other, and were just there to make each other laugh. I was happy. In 2017 they had left me because I was impulsively drinking alcohol (spirits) which I had stolen from my mother. My school counsellor referred me to a childrens mental health program at the hospital. I received short term treatment with CBT and was put on Fluoxetine 25mg. I swallowed all those pills hoping that they would kill me. 

In 2017 I had also met my first boyfriend in February. I will talk about him later. In April, I had finally had enough of my dads behavior, always screaming about something. It shredded away at my confidence and self-esteem for all those years and I had finally hit my breaking point. I left and stayed with my mum full-time. He would send me all these abusive texts, along the lines of ""why don't you love me,"" and lots of derogatory things such as ""you are a selfish little brat,"" but the things he said that ruined me the most was him blaming me for everything. He threatened to kill himself, and one night he stopped all the texts with a final ""goodbye."" I thought he was actually going to kill himself. I tried to kill myself by bleeding to death, and I have quite a few big scars from it. I kept them a secret until they were healed. It saddens me that I've done this to myself because it was only a month before my 14th birthday. I also tried to kill myself on the night of birthday by overdosing on paracetamol. I also kept that a secret and had horrible liver pains for weeks. I thought I was going to die and I was so eager for it. 

I'm going to skip out a bit as this is so long and I am way off track to what I originally wanted to say, but I will talk about my boyfriend. We dated from Feb 2017 to Jan 2018, I broke up with him on new years. He is 2 years older than me. As a boyfriend would, he loved me a lot, but he was so needy. He expected me to sneak out nearly every night to his house and it caused so many problems with my sleep. If I didn't go he would send me pictures of him crying and cutting himself. He would threaten to kill himself. On the nights I did go, the first 6 months of it were horrible. I would be so, extremely sleep deprived and he would expect sex. I lost my virginity to him when I was 13. I didn't really know what to say so I let him do it. From then on he would get so aroused all the time and would force himself on me while I pretended to sleep. If I said no, he would lay beside me and cry for hours. I felt so trapped. I eventually became strong enough to bring it up. He was so apologetic and never done it again. He now suffers from anxiety and depression since our relationship became more rocky and we had breaks. Yes, I was stupid enough to go back. I felt alone. 

Anyway, that's the background to what I'm going to continue with. I've skipped a bit. This year has been bad but not as bad as last year. I've had over 150 truancies from school this year, been suspended twice(currently am), been addicted to alcohol, smoked too much weed from June-Aug, etc.

I'm 15 years and 5 months today. I've been through some shit. I know I'm not the worst out there and I'm not feeling all sad and sorry for myself either, but I am a little disappointed about it. I just wish I could've had a normal childhood. This is the first time I've cried in such a long time. Nevermind that lasted for about 2 minutes. I can't even cry anymore.  I've become so fucking numb and things don't get to me, because I've adapted to it. I feel like I've been so depressed that it's just fallen through and cancelled itself out. I think it's because I didn't want anybody to worry about me so I acted fine, pretended to laugh and made jokes about things, and that it actually helped me overcome my real feelings. These days I am a different person, I can't say I'm happier but that's how I externally express myself. I feel like I have this underlying sadness that I can't reach and it frustrates me because I want to be sad for once. I feel lost without being sad.

I can't say how I feel because I have a completely mindset too often. I don't consider myself depressed anymore. I don't fit the criteria. I do suffer from a little bit of anxiety here and there. I get into these uncontrollable phases where I will sit in one place without moving and stare at one spot for up to an hour. I don't think, I don't feel, I'm just completely disassociated, like I'm a body without a brain or soul. I stop when something scares me, like a sound or movement. I then feel like I'm having a heart attack because of it, and it makes me angry. I experience sudden rage sometimes, not like I used to, but the last time I got so angry I punched a tin wall until my knuckles bled. I struggle to fall asleep every night now, I've tried everything except medications. I have been on Quetiapene for sleep issues but I tried to kill myself with all of those too, it's going to be hard for me to be prescribed anything now. I'm also apathetic, and I don't want to be, I can't help but not care about anything or anyone. The only person I care about is my mum. She's the only person I love. I'm crying again. I haven't felt any real feelings in so fucking long, and here I am finally crying to myself writing a fucking essay on reddit at 3am.

If you've even got this far. I don't know what I'm whining about, I feel like I missed out a bunch of vital information and filled this is with a bunch of unnecessary shit. I'm posting this because I just want to know what is wrong with me, diagnosis wise. I'm not depressed, I know that much. I just want to have an idea on what to research so I know what I can try do to make myself feel better, I guess. I don't want to feel like a lost soul anymore. I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, and my dad was diagnosed with bipolar too, but my counsellors and family don't think I have it. I will regret this in the morning when I wake up a different mood, but like I said, if anyone has read this, I would appreciate anything.

Thank you.

59,"F18 .I will discuss situations that occur in my life and I would like advice please :)

I refuse photos as much as possible but when it is unavoidable I ask the person to please not show me the photo because I am terrified of seeing myself. When I do see photos of myself I often cry and think about how much I hate being myself. Recently I had prom and I haven't stopped crying because my friends have been sending photos and posting photos that include me in it and upon seeing myself I just breakdown into tears, but I can't ask them to delete the photo because that is selfish. Also my mother posted a photo of me without my permission and she told me it got 45 comments, immediently I feel so sick to my stomach. I never asked for judgement.

Continuing with that point, my social media has 0 photos, no profile picture, no uploads, nothing. I just can't do it.

I don't look into any mirrors, except a small makeup compact mirror to do my makeup, but once I am ready I do not check how I look overall in the mirror as I feel anxious and repulsed to do so. I will literally move my body so that I am not in the view of the mirror, even if that means me sitting awkwardly. Basically I never know how I look, and people around me are always correcting me saying ""You have something in your hair"", ""Your lip gloss is smudged"", things like that; because I can't bring myself the courage to see how I look.

When people compliment me I have no doubt that they are lying and honestly ""compliments"" make me feel worse about myself.

I have realised that at all times of the day I am subconsciously obsessing over the fact that I am ugly and how others perceive me in social situations because of my appearance.

I have talked about surgery to my mother (nosejob), and she doesn't disagree when I mention wanting to change my nose and how big it is.

Every night after I take off my makeup I squeeze any bump on my face, whether it be a pimple or whatever. I have done this EVERYNIGHT for as long as I remember.

Every photo of myself is so different, completely different people. I don’t know what I actually look like. People tell me I’m attractive but then I think of the bad photos of me, and I realise that people are lying to me. If someone asked me to describe what I look like I would not be able to give an answer. When in public, I completely forget what I look like and an ugly image plays over in my mind.

I feel ashamed to be myself and every part of my being.

This is ruining my life because I am so down and I dislike myself in entirety and that makes me sad. My friends are sick of me because I always say no to being in photos with them or running past mirrors in my view. They assume i am discluding myself or being a drama queen when really I just don't know whats wrong with me; I could never explain this to them.

Reading this all back I have now had a revelation that I have a real problem. I dont know what to do or if I even have BDD. Please help me out I feel so lost and tired. .",30Sep2018,4

I have struggled with a mix of OCD and depression for 9 years now. However, my depression was very very bad as a teenager so my OCD was never touched on. Fortunately I have not felt depressed in a few years! But, just over a year ago I broke up with someone because they were emotionally abusive (or maybe I'm just sensitive because of my mental health history). My OCD was triggered like never before. (Previously, my OCD was nothing too crazy, I would just feel comfort in tapping things or checking things multiple times and although it was stressful it wasn't overbearing.) I was suddenly obsessed that everything was dirty and would wash my hands until they were so raw, they got infected and I needed antibiotics. It has calmed down a lot since June but I still have way more triggers than before. I also get really dizzy in stressful situations. I'm not depressed but I'm just miserable with my OCD. I don't have a problem sleeping but my nighttime routine with OCD is so long and unpredictable that I just can't face myself to do it so I stay awake until I can't anymore. 
My problem is that I have just gone back to university and although my OCD is better than last year I'm worried it'll get really bad again and I'll do badly in my studies. 
I have never ever spoken to anyone about this and even putting this up on Reddit is tricky because I think that people will see me as crazy. I finally feel ready to talk to someone but I don't know who. I have a local doctors or my university have a councillor but I don't know who would be most appropriate. As a teen I had one councillor session and got sent to the doctors. Also since I am not as bad as last year will I be taken seriously??

To start, I live in the United States. For the first time last night, I called the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. It was a positive experience. The woman I talked to helped me a lot. I wasn’t suicidal, but I was at the point where I was completely overwhelmed (I have depression and anxiety; currently on Lamictal and Cymbalta), and just needed someone to reach out to. I know I have things to be grateful for, but the weight of all of the negative felt like it was becoming too much. We stayed on the phone from an hour. I went from hysterics to being able to take the correct dose of my Xanax and go to bed.

I have interviewed pressure groups and patients on order to understand their experiences. However I thought that I might get more honest opinions with the anonymity of the internet. As well as the fact most of the people I ended up interviewing were teenagers so I wanted a larger range of opinions. I recognise that I am asking a really personal question. I have grown up with chronic pain since I was a kid and so this work comes from a personal place. And understand if you don't  want to be a part of it I completely understand.

They can be both positive and negative.

Examples are 

""My age doesn't take away from my pain""

""I don't need your medical advise or your pity""

""I'm tired of feeling tired""

""I don't look ill and you don't look stupid""

""I refuse to feel guilty for something I can't control""

72,"At my doctor's surgery, you have to call up to make an appointment and they ask for a briefing of what seems to be the problem (I guess so they can book you in in order of priority). They no longer do online bookings (and even so the system never worked when they did have that facility). 

Once I am in seeing my doctor, in the past, I have found that they will book my in again if they think it is necessary to go back soon for an update and to see how I am doing, so that means I don't have to explain myself to the receptionist again. 

However I am wondering what to say when I make that initial call. Despite it being a professional workplace, I still feel there is a stigma to it and I don't feel comfortable telling the receptionist in fear of my problem is ""not enough"" to deserve an appointment.

The other new thing that they are doing now is arranging a phone call with the doctor to see if anything can be sorted out there, rather than coming down to the surgery for a face-to-face. 

I don't mind that as such as you are only going to be saying the same thing and they put you on the phone with a legitimate doctor, but with the practice only being down the road, I sometimes feel it is easier to pour your heart out when you can actually see the person and communicate fully. Just a preference thing. I think they are only leaving those appointments to the ones who really need it.

&amp;#x200B;

My situation is that I have decided I really need to go back after I got so bad, I had a breakdown, lost my job, which isn't the first time this has happened, and the effect really messed up my mental well being. I didn't realise how bad my anxiety and depression had gotten. I keep going through phases where things are just fine, normal, good and the next I am unable to control my irrational emotions and thought process, so much so that it has clearly been interfering in my day to day life and I just don't know what to do anymore. I am in therapy, but I don't feel it is working for me unfortunately. I am fed up of getting like this. The next step is to have a chat to my GP about it. I was going for regular appointments as they monitored how I was doing, but I stopped going because I thought I was doing fine and I didn't seem to need to see anyone anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when you call up, what do you say? I know this happens to a lot of people, but I just feel embarrassed and like second class if I call for something mental rather than physical. I get so nervous about calling, to the point where I just put off making an appointment altogether. It's like having to prove yourself to a receptionist you don't even know.

74,"First post here. Not even sure if it relevant, but just looking for some support.
Been depressed for a lot of years. Felt a little better in the beginning of 2018 but things are just falling apart again. Also being a former schizophrenic with a ton of delusions is not easy and seems like everything is coming back. Been managing to stay in touch with reality but it just keeps getting harder. And then, the person I'm in love with tells that she now loves someone else and would never meet me. We have text conversations like nothing ever happened which is quite hard for me to deal with. She meant the world to me and I haven't been able to move on no matter how hard I try.

So I've come up with an idea that I would suicide in exactly a year from now and before that I give life one last chance to see if it can get any better. 
Whole idea is that I would some how ignore all the mental and emotional trauma that surrounds me knowing it would all end in a year and that would help me  focus on important things in life.

I'm a bit lost at this point, I'm french and I've been diagnosed with checking OCD and rOCD which is a form of OCD that latches onto relationships with a lot of intrusive thoughts that can be really triggering. I've been struggling with rOCD since I began dating people and being involved in serious relationships but I only put a name on it 3  months ago when things were going real bad.

I know for the sake of my therapy I shouldn't reassure myself by going onto forums and by asking advice, but It's rather an outlook I want from you guys.

So, since I began struggling with OCD I feel that i'm dissociated or depersonalized, it's really difficult for me to feel things, to feel love even (recurring things amongst rOCD sufferers) but also to think things are real;This year I've graduated, applied to one of the best MSc in my area, met my current boyfriend, passed a driving licence and so on... but it's like I didn't do any of those things, that I'm not aware of my accomplishments. That those things aren't real/true and that i'm living on autopilot.

I talked to my therapist about that and she recommended some mindfulness exercises, which I am doing, but I want more insights about this issue, I'm stuggling so much about this, I feel like a robot.

I don't know what causes that autopilot feeling, along with the depersonalization thing...  

I want an outlook on this, I don't know if it's really dissociation or depersonalization, and I don't know how to cope with it, my next appointment with my therapist is in a long time, and I don't know what to do right now besides mindfulness exercises.

I used quetiapine to fall asleep at 02:00 AM yesterday, but I'm very aware it's a neuroleptic, and that long-term or jagged use might have consequences.

I'm currently taking 15mg aripiprazole, also a neuroleptic, for my illness.

My doctor hasn't said much about using quetiapine as a sleeping aid. We only discussed it in terms of withdrawing from lorazepam.

The problems I see are multiple:

- I don't know the strength of the 25mg quetiapine dosage. It has always helped me fall asleep easily, but I remember a time I was given 250mg to fall asleep due to the hospital not having a lorazepam dosage. I guess I'm semi-aware this is a small dosage.

- I don't know how it will affect me. Should I take the meds consistently after I've started my ""sleep fixing therapy"" or can I take them only in emergencies, like not being able to fall asleep past 2 AM?

I’m not stupid, I know eating disorders can get increasingly worse, and even if i feel in control of it now, it could become worse with that mentality. I guess I’m just asking for some advice. Again, i don’t skip meals or binge/pudge all the time, i just occasionally will make myself throw up if i eat too much. If anyone has any tips for getting help or how to prevent bulemia from getting worse, please let me know❤️",30Sep2018,1

For the past half a year I have been having intrusive thoughts of one event that was very unpleasant to me. Basically i was in a situation where everyone was laughing at me + i said some cringy shit and it haunts me to this day. I know very well it is irrational to care about this but it just won't go away from my head. Its come to this point that whenever i get that thought i feel anxiety-like pain in my chest. Sometimes its more severe and it literally makes me anxious as fuck with faster heartbeat. I visited and told my doctor who also treats my tics that i have a ""thinking tic"" and she immediately prescribed me sertraline.

87,"Poor mental health sucks. And some days are worse than others. I thought I'd list a few tips that I use when I'm having a bad mental health day and maybe it'll help others. I know everyone is different, but these are some basic things that help get me up and going:

1. The hardest part is getting out of bed. I know. You'll want to lay there all day.To get out of bed, focus on the basic tasks: swing one leg over the side, then the other leg. Sit up. Put your feet on the ground. It's a little easier when you force yourself to go through every step in your head.

2. If you need more motivation to get out of bed, use your bladder. Eventually, you'll have to pee. When that happens grab your towel and jump in the shower too. If you don't do anything else in the shower, at a minimum wash your face. You'll feel more refreshed. 

3. Once you make it out of the shower, you did it! The hardest part is over. Brush your teeth. Fresh breath will make you feel more ready for the day. 

4. Get dressed. Put on clean clothes that make you feel good. No ""bum"" clothes. For me ""bum"" clothes are athletic clothing because I'm more often very lazy while wearing running shorts than if I were to put on a nice pair of jeans and a favorite shirt. No sweatpants. I've realized the saying ""dress how you want to feel"" is quite accurate. 

4. Drink a glass of water. It'll get your body working. Cold water helps refresh me more than hot water or room temperature water.

5. If you can, eat something. If you can't and find yourself back in bed, that's ok. You're doing great. In bed try to avoid your phone (I know, this is really hard). Social media will make you feel worse. Try watching a feel-good movie/show (for me this is a 90s Disney movie or The Office) or reading something (a magazine, book, comics- personally I recommend Calvin and Hobbes). You'll be more engaged and focus less on what's going on inside your head than when you're fumbling around the internet.

6. Go for a walk outside. Yes, walking to your mailbox or the end of the driveway counts. Chances are if you get that far you can go a little further, like around the block. Focus on your breathing, how fresh the air feels coming through your nostrils and then exhaling.

7. Do one thing that you know will make you feel a little better. Examples: do a face mask, clean your room, draw a picture, write, stretch, call a family member or friend, water your plants. Focus on the little joys of being awake in this moment.

I am not aiming to discourage anyone from sharing this sentiment. Please do, and be there for your friends. However, speaking as someone who has self-harmed and contemplated suicide for years, I will never take you up your offer, and I need you to know that maybe there was nothing you could have done. 

First, please try to understand this perspective - suicide is not a decision to be made. It is a final act that life inescapably drives some toward. 

I'm fortunate to have loved ones close by, and I am confident that at least half would fulfill their offer with sincerity. However, these are the same people who I most desperately want to hide my truth from. I have spent decades carefully structuring my life to appear normal and functional, and absent of ""warning signs."" I studied psychology and couselling and know how to behave and what answers to give. From the outset I am just another young parent - my kids go to school and extracurriculars, I work, and we do family activities on the weekend. During all of this, my depression is whispering and biding it's time in the dark corners, patient, because it always knows we will be alone eventually. I dabbled in cutting at first, but soon sought out other forms of physical harm that didn't leave such telltale marks. I now have a mental catalogue of ways to cause myself pain or damage that largely won't be noticed, let alone cause suspicion. You will not find a semicolon tattooed on me, nor a medical history of mental health, because I don't cry for help. When my time comes, no one will see it coming, and if everything goes well, no one will even realize it has happened. 

I fully understand how suicide would hurt the people I care about; this encourages me to plan my actions with utmost care. It may not make sense, but for the same reason I will not come to friends with my troubles. Their lives are not much different from my own, and I am acutely aware of their burdens. My illness is just another problem to shoulder, and the thought of dumping that weight on someone I care about is unbearable.

Not every day is this bad; if it were, I would not be writing this. I have sought, and am receiving help, but coping is not a cure and I suspect the struggle will always remain. I am playing to win a long game here (or lose, depending on your perspective), and no one else even knows they're on the board. And that's exactly how I need it to be.

90,"I am married with a wife and two daughters, H and A. We are a Christian family, and, apart from some marital issues between me and the wife, are in a good situation. A few years ago, we moved for the first time in our girls' lifetimes to be closer to my job, and while A is thriving, H has just completely lost it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started when we found out she was cutting in early January of 2017. We scheduled an appointment with a counselor to deal with this issue, but at her very first appointment she revealed that she was actively suicidal and got referred to a nearby psychiatric hospital, where she spent 5 days inpatient and then stepped down to a PHP. We were determined to get through this issue so we could get on with our lives. She was a freshman in high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was when the first instance of manipulation happened. We got called in to the hospital shortly before she was to be discharged, where she informed us that she 'needed to go back to inpatient' so she could 'work through what she'd learned.' The wife and I were both against it, as we could both see right through it, but the staff were on her side and she got readmitted to inpatient for another 5 days. When she was finally discharged, she went on Homebound (basically doing public school from home) as she was close to 2 months behind. It was a struggle to get her to do her work, and the only reason she was able to pass was that her teachers cut her work load down to about a quarter of what the rest of her class was doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to December 2017. H had been doing okay, average grades in school, had a bit of an attitude and was rather lazy around the house but we chalked it up to teenage angst. Anyway, one night, my wife got mad at H after a hard day because H had been wearing her shoes without permission. H completely lost it and started verbally attacking her little sister. Once that finally died down, H had stomped off and the wife was trying to console A, when H just appeared and started cussing out her mother. Screaming, profanity, flipping her off, the whole 9 yards. At this point my wife has had enough and leaves to go for a drive, which she often does when she needs to calm down. H locks herself in her room again, and I'm left to deal with poor A, who was finally calming down when H was back and running out of the kitchen with a big steak knife saying that she was going to kill herself. In my attempts to physically restrain her, she managed to slice the artery in her wrist, so poor A had to call 911 while I was trying to deal with that. Police and EMS arrive and take her away in an ambulance, but A and I have to stay behind to file a report. When I finally make it to the hospital, staff informs me that H has consented to be admitted inpatient again, but the nearest psych ward with a bed is over 3 hours away. Okay, fine, she needs help. She gets transferred there overnight while I go home and make arrangements with my work, hotels, etc. Spend a week down there with her, and she's discharged and back home with some med changes. The whole affair has strained our family relationships and everything is rocky at home.

&amp;#x200B;

This time, she doesn't make it three months out of the hospital. February 2018 she leaves a suicide note in her class basically saying 'fuck you all, I'm going to kill myself' and leaves the school building unnoticed. She is found 4 hours later by a member of a search party with no damage except for a few topical cuts she managed to inflict with her broken glasses lens. The person who found her calls 911 and alerts them of her location as they're chasing her through the stream. Police eventually catch up with them, and when H realizes she can't outrun them goes under water and refuses to come up until she is pulled out by officers. She was handcuffed and taken to the hospital, where the wife, A and I meet her. Surprise surprise, another hospital admission. This time she is 8 days inpatient, during which time she tried to convince the staff to send her to residential because we were being 'just horrible' to her. However, by the time she steps down to PHP she has changed her tune and says she is 'ready to get better.' She had a good couple of months and managed to pull her grades up enough to pass her sophomore year, made some friends, and set some life and career goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the present, H is 16 and is already flunking her junior year even though she's hardly a month in. She's constantly picking on A to the point where it's negatively affecting A's mental health. She is lazy, refuses to do any chores around the house, and gives me and my wife a severe attitude. She's converted to atheism and refuses to do anything religious. She has once again completely isolated herself socially, but still complains constantly about not having friends. She listens to obscene music, wears more revealing clothing, is fluent in curse words, and is experimenting with her prescription medications. She has gotten into a cycle of binge eating and restricting calories, but has been leaning heavily towards the binge eating side an has ballooned up to 220 pounds at 5'5"". She associates with unsavory people, one of whom she is dating. Last week she went on a school field trip, and when one of her classmates had an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital, all she would say was that the student was an 'attention seeking bitch' and that she 'ruined her trip.' She has managed to spend over $200 of my money behind my back in under a week despite knowing that we're currently struggling financially. She is once again refusing to do her schoolwork. She writes in her journal about how she's 'done looking for attention' and is going to 'kill herself for real this time,' calls herself a disgusting cunt, and, perhaps most alarmingly, talks about how sometimes she wants to kill someone just to see what it's like. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not hard to see that she's miserable. But her attitude and her actions are tearing our family apart. My wife's already poor mental health has hit rock bottom, and she's told H that if she gets admitted to the hospital again, she's not coming back. A is also feeling the strain, as she's always stressing about H and feels the need to always be there to babysit H as she is the only one who H still has some semblance of a relationship with. I've never felt so worthless, so hopeless, and I'm done. I can't deal with H anymore. I want to wash my hands of her and focus on mending what's left of our broken family. And just thinking that makes me feel like a horrible man and father, but it's the truth.

It was so rough they had to check if he was even alive. Worse still I couldn't go with him to the hospital because I was ordered to stay behind to deal with reporters and lawyers. I spent 4 hours after that thinking my best friend was dead or in a coma because reporters and medics and every other jerk under the sun kept telling me he isn't coming back. Thankfully he is alive and he's sorta back but for some reason I still am freaked out and I can't understand any of it. I can't sleep or eat nor can I really control my emotions. One minute I'm okayish the next I want to get revenge then the next I'm crying uncontrollably and overwhelmingly I'm just raging.

(If this isnt formatted correctly I'm sorry, new to Reddit)

I, 24 F, and my fiance, 26 M, have been talking about starting a family. I want to adopt, so we are adopting one child. He wants a biological child, so hes been asking me to consider a surrogate.

The reason we are doing the surrogate is because I had a tubal litigation and ablation in May, so theres no way I can bear children. I had it done because I was too afraid of passing my disorders to my children. My mother is schizophrenic so it was just too much for me. I did this under the assumption that I, would be unfit to be a parent, or that I would pass along the biomarkers for my mental illness.

Back to the surrogate thing, we heard recently that there is only a 10% chance that the biomarkers can be passed on. I still feel uneasy ab out it but I told him I would think about it. He really wants it to happen but I just don't know. Its very expensive and theres still a 10% chance. To me, anything above 0% is enough.

So while I'm thinking this over, what is everyones thoughts on this? Is 10% not enough to worry about?

Long story short this drama is causing me a great deal of anxiety. So much so that laying in bed thinking about work the next morning makes me feel ill. 

I’m on abilify because I had a psychotic break a few years back and am diagnosed as being “somewhere on the bipolar schizoaffective spectrum” (because I have been asymptomatic since leaving the psych ward doctors were unsure of a definite diagnosis) 

I have a prescription for clonazepam for anxiety to take as needed, which usually means once or twice a month. I know this is a highly addictive medication and don’t want to abuse it.

99,"Hi guys, hopefully this is the right place to post this. If not feel free to direct me elsewhere!

I have dealt with panic disorder for about ten years. At first my doctor prescribed Xanax for panic attacks and nothing else. After several years his nurse practitioner talked to me and realized I had never been offered meds to ease the anxiety before it got to the point of panic.

She talked to me about the options and we decided on Zoloft. It did great for my anxiety but lately I'd been experiencing some depression. At my most recent check in I brought this up with her, and we made the decision to switch from Zoloft to Prozac.

I'm still in the transition phase, but so far it has gone MUCH more smoothly than when I started Zoloft. I don't feel antsy, I have no trouble sleeping. I felt drowsy the first day and have had a bit of a headache since, but that's starting to fade.

What scares me is that I feel happy. And motivated to do housework, and more interested in music and art. I know it sounds dumb because that's kind of the point of the whole thing. I'm just scared that like, what if this is TOO much of a change and I'm becoming manic? Or am I just so used to feeling depressed that the change feels so strong to me? Is this just a ""new med"" glow? I remember feeling a sense of relief when I started Zoloft and I'm afraid it's just that happening again. But at the same time, I don't remember feeling so happy and calm after starting Zoloft, just glad that I wasn't having panic attacks daily anymore.

I've lost skills I loved such as playing musical instruments, speaking 2 foreign languages, running 13+mi a day.
