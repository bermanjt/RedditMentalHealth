1,"So I recently got diagnosed with bipolar. 

The thing is, I’m aware. I’m aware of everything I do. Granted I don’t always have full control over what I’m doing but I’m coherent during it. 

I have more lows than highs, my lows are low. They last for months. I think the worst was 2 years where I just abused myself through drink, drugs, and in the end manually. I rarely have highs. I do go through manic stages where my mind works on over time, the words move faster than my lips, I feel invincible, confident, and generally overall happiness. 

Recently I’ve been having more psychotic episodes, in the sense of hearing things/voices. It’s not new, but right now it’s probably at the worst it’s ever been. 

The reason why I’m posting Is because I’m not conformable with someone telling me I’m bipolar. Granted my mood varies, but it’s not regular thing. 85% of the time I have my head in my hands trying to control my thoughts. 

I honestly feel like I’m loosing it. 
Hopefully some of that makes sense to at least one person. ",19Aug2018,1,
2,"Hello! I'm not a local here so if this post is irrelevant to the subreddit I'll happily remove it. 

I have a disorder called Depersonalization/Derealization (DPDR), and with that comes the lovely charcuterie of anxiety and depression, which both gnaw at my core constantly. 

My emotions are often incredibly intense. No emotion is good or bad anymore, it doesn't matter because they are all so crippling in their own unique ways. An overwhelming tidal wave of feeling. At times it feels like I could physically implode from the pressure inside my head. 

For the past 2 years I've had suicidal thoughts every day. Not all days are bad days, some are fantastic in fact, but not one day has passed where, at some point, I haven't thought ""I would be better off dead."" 

Today marks a total 12 (ish) hours free of suicidal thoughts. Talking about suicide isn't even bringing up thoughts. There is a high chance I return to having regular suicidal thoughts, but I believe just this one day is enough to push me through until it subsides.

I felt like this was too broad for /r/DPDR, so I brought it over here! Remember to celebrate your forward progress, mental illness is a battle more difficult than many ever have to face.

3,"I’m looking at a local family medicine practice for mental health evaluation. I’m quite sure I’m depressed and I have OCD. 

I know I need to save money. I’m a broke college student who is working on my savings account, applying for jobs.

 I considering apply for student-oriented healthcare which gets me cheap doctor visits or pays for everything entirely. My siblings gave me a hard time: “Oh, you’re going to be on welfare your entire life and you’re going to be a lazy bum and...”

The ironic part, all my siblings received scholarships and grants when they were in college, as did I. But that’s the thing, what do they want me to do, amass $5,000 in student loans or pay $500 per doctor visit, or take advantage of cheap/free healthcare?

So I probably shouldn’t worry about my siblings and just get the emotional/psychological help I need, right?￼

4,"**this is my first post on reddit so if you think this belongs elsewhere, i’ll happily remove it.

we were on a trip to istanbul with my family and had an accident, only my brother (10) and i(3) survived.

we were raised by our mentally ill grandmother with the help of our uncle and aunt. we were always aware of her mental problems and didn’t let it shape us (i hope).

this is the backstory

the thing is, since i don’t have any single memory with them, it was relatively easy for me to cope with it while my brother was the one always grieved, and i only cried when i saw him cry.
i met with people who recently lost their parents but i never understood how they feel, because i never knew what “having parents” was like. in recent years this became annoying and i don’t know why..
i started to get jealous of my friends’ families because i saw how they supported them with their decisions, hobbies etc. while i quit basketball in high-school because i had nobody to pick me up. My brother played piano from age 4 until their death, but i quit piano and guitar lessons because i had nobody to show me i had to exercise to do things properly. of course, this affected my academic life. i almost dropped out of high school because i never opened a book to study though my uncle and brother encouraged me to study at the last year. thanks to them, i was accepted to computer science faculty in a remarkable university which i still struggle in my 7th year.

im 24 years old i can’t focus on anything, have major depression, social anxiety(though i have many friends), trust issues and many which i do/do not know.

in recent years i started to ask myself;

-how would life be without them dying?
-what do people think about me? do they pity me? 
-do people treat me different because of this? or are they scared?
-am i doing the right thing?*

*this is the most annoying question that i can’t get out of my head. because everybody around me had fundamental education from their parent(s) but i didn’t and this bugs me every single day. i know i don’t have to worry about what other people think about me but WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT ME IS HOW I SURVIVED UNTIL NOW. it’s a nightmare.

because of this, i can’t enjoy life, feel guilty when i’m having fun etc. i have physical anxiety although i am a 6’5 guy with a fit body because i feel like the first person that should’ve appreciated me for what i am had to be my mother.

i can’t fully trust anyone but i’m afraid that they’ll leave me if i do them wrong even a little.

i have seen psychologists for a long time, i had antidepressant treatments several times but i lost hope in them and i quit. antidepressants only helped me to get over my suicidal thoughts when i was 16 and i think i don’t have any left.

the most annoying thing is nobody understands how i feel, and nobody will.

14,"Hello, 

I don't really know how to explain how I'm feeling, or why I feel this way. 

For the past couple of weeks I've been off from work. I injured my knee, I believe with tendonitis as it seems to be getting better now, but I'm still limping when I walk and don't want to (aggravate?) the injury any further. 

However this situation has just gotten worse. I didn't call up work to say I wasn't coming in beforehand, and on the day I didn't go back in I felt like it was too late to say anything or I'd get bollocked for it essentially. I was called up by my manager but I left it, I get a really horrible feeling when I talk to people on the phone. I haven't even gone to a doctor to see if there's anything worse to my knee injury because I can't bring myself to make phone calls.

I never feel truly comfortable when at a new job. Everywhere I work I struggle to make any real friends, I don't end up having a grudge with anyone I just never feel like I fit in anywhere. I'm not great at making friends. But generally I try to be polite and don't really go out of my way to bother anyone.

Every manager I've had seems to have something against me. They never really express it but I can tell by the way they speak to me. I don't intentionally do things wrong but I need people to simplify things for me because I'm too dense to properly understand what people want from me sometimes.

I've also recently been talking to a girl I met on tinder, spoke to her quite a lot over the past two weeks and she seems really nice. I met her yesterday and while she said she enjoyed it I was really shy and awkward and at times was lost for words. I like her a lot, on social media I have no problem talking to her but in person my mind just goes blank sometimes and I don't know why. 

I've had an awkward past as well. I was a loud and aggressive child when I was young, when I was 8 I was forced into a sexual situation with an older boy that I never really understood until I was older, and I never really thought it affected me but maybe it has and I just don't understand it.

My dad died when I was 18, my grandad a couple years later, I ended up leaving university because I felt like the friends I had didn't like me and missed home, and my student loan was giving me problems as well so I packed that in. I've tried working my way up the ladder but any boss I have treats me like both an idiot and like I'm doing things wrong on purpose. 

Recently I've been staying up late, sleeping for upwards of 12 hours, I don't eat much anymore, I find it hard to get out of bed when I do wake up. 

When I was a child my mother thinks I had autism, or some kind of (illness?) Like ADHD. Even now she suggests going to a doctor to ask about it, because I was never tested for it as a kid. Sometimes I can't express emotion and I struggle socially except with close friends, so maybe it makes sense? 

I want to go back to work, but it's been two weeks, and I feel like if I go back things will just get worse, I can't just say I've been feeling down and nursing an injury as an excuse for not turning up and not even calling in. 

I feel anxious out in public and rarely leave the house these days as well. I'm 23 years old and I feel like I'm still a child. 

When things get uncomfortable for me I just stay quiet and end up staring into space or try to distract myself. 

I've never seriously thought about killing myself, I don't have a feeling that I have to end my life, but I feel so numb to some situations and sometimes I just want to be someone else, exist somewhere else or just not be me. 

I don't know, I just feel lost, always. Like I don't belong anywhere and don't fit in anywhere. That people are judging me.

17,"So this just happened in the last 30 minutes. My mom, brother and I are sitting on the couch watching TV. 

I felt totally fine, the only thing is that I’ve been somewhat tired the last couple of hours because I’ve been up much longer today than the last few days. Also, I had some cooked fish an hour+ ago, so could that possibly affect me?

All of a sudden, I start telling them something along the lines of “I don’t feel good, guys...” and I’m not sure what else I said. But my family starts freaking out saying we need to go to the hospital, and they bring me a bowl in case i need to throw up, etc. but then a couple of minutes later I am back to normal. I have no memory of when I was telling them I felt sick!

18,"Now I’m going to be real about this even if this turns out to be right I wouldn’t really care anyway because I am the way I am and I don’t plan on changing however I’ve recently been questioning this and I’d like a little bit of advice/to hear people’s opinions:

I really started thinking about  this a day or so ago when my friend lost her mother to cancer. She told me about it but weirdly I didn’t feel anything at all. Or at least I didn’t feel truly sad or bad on her behalf, on the contrary when I told a family member I was holding back a smile because the news was different and therefor somewhat exciting. I realise this probably makes me seem like an absolutely dreadful person (hence why I’m asking about this as anonymously as possible over Reddit) but I can’t really help it. 

Just previous to this I lied to an immediate family member about something quite important to avoid trouble. When I was confronted about this (said lie came out) I was more miffed about my image and covering for myself than the fact that I had upset someone who cares about me. 

On both of these occasions I have been able to quite accurately pretend to care, used crocodile tears and said the right things but everything I was saying and doing was completely fabricated. 

I have listened to those apparently heartbreaking last word emergency service calls from people who knew they were about to die. I’ve listened to that audio recording of the little girl the moors murders recorded and killed and I don’t feel anything at all while listening to them apart from maybe fascination (not in a morbid I would go out and commit a murder way because I wouldn’t). 

I also have difficulty taking the blame for my actions (I’ve been told this by a few different people). I’ve always had some sort of excuse or have been able to talk my way out of situations but I’ve always considered this a perfectly normal thing to do? 

Here’s the thing though, I haven’t really had any past trauma, I haven’t broken the law and I’m still only 17. I think I’m probably a little better than I was when I was a bit younger (I used to torture insects as a child and when I grew a little older I had a fascination with medieval torture mechanisms).


Again I’m not worried about myself, I think I’m probably fine and just maybe haven’t matured properly yet. I just want to hear people’s opinions because I’m very conflicted right now. I don’t think I would go to see a professional because I don’t want to put myself into a position where I may or may not end up with a label that could socially ruin me so this is about the closest I’m going to get to asking for help.

19,"First up- Diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety and I have ADHD symptoms but my psychiatrist thinks its caused by the depression (plus its not that bad). 



Recently I've noticed that my brain is all over the place (which was going to be the original title but it could be interpreted wrongly lol).  



NSFW part- A couple days ago I noticed that I'm all over the place during sexual situations... Like one minute I will want something then the next minute it will be completely different. Obviously not going into detail.... All I'm going to say is that this happens multiple times during sexual situations and is not that fun to deal with. This also happens in non-sexual situations. 


Non NSFW part- I always have to be doing something while listening... If I don't I will start to daydream. Like playing with a pen or paper while listening to a speech (mostly during sermons at church). If I don't play with a pen or something I will daydream and completely block out everything else (which I love doing during church lol).

20,"Hello there!

This week I had hard moments that made me fall back into bad, very bad anxiety, like one I hadn't felt in a long time. I am also currently struck by loneliness, intrusive thoughts, trauma, anorexic tendencies... so yeah, currently, globally, I'm not good. 

But it's okay. I watched some movies that made me feel so good, fulfilled, that got me out of my mentally ill head. But it's okay, because I talked with a friend who blows my mind with all the things she knows in every conversation. But it's okay, cause my cat sat next to me by herself and started to purr for no reason and it was cute. But it's okay, because even during the hardest parts, there are some good things. 

My philosophy is to just let myself be carried by the waves and take what I'm given. It helps with my anxiety and depression. It helps me appreciating the little good things life offers me.

I rarely have true good moments. They last for an hour, a day. But when they're here - it's so good. It truly makes me feel like I'm alive and the closest to happy I'll ever be. I'll take it. It's enough for me to look forward to something during bad times. 

I don't always remember this - when I feel badly depressed, I'm very negative. But afterwards I always look back and think... hey, this isn't so bad now. I went through this bad moment. I can do it again. It will always have an end.

I think we all need to find little things that makes us happy for even as little as a second. It's worth living for. Sometimes you just gotta let yourself be carried by the waves. 

Everyone on here is incredibly strong. We're all going through tough stuff, and the most important thing to remember is, we're here. 

I hope you all have a nice day, a nice week, and find that something that lights up your life.",19Aug2018,4,
21,"For the past month and a half or so, I’ve been on-and-off worrying about a few different things, which either comes in the form of worrying about the (imagined) present or the (imagined) future. I put “imagined” in parentheses because I am aware that all of my worries are just projections in my head, but it still feels real—it’s like my brain believes these imagined worries are *actually happening*, unable to tell the difference between reality and artifice.

Sometimes the worries compound, or they exist as really vague feelings, making it hard to assess them or deal with them. Even if I can rationally tell myself, “I’m going to get through this, worries are temporary,”’I still can’t convince myself out of the terrible feeling in my stomach.

ALTHOUGH, the reason I'm making this post is because my doctor's office is very fast paced and unless there's a very specific follow-up appointment you get 10 minutes with the doctor before she has to try and move on to her next patient.

So I'm asking here in hopes of giving her as much information as quick as I can to make her life as easy as possible.

So as of recently I've started to notice a trend in my sad episodes and that they're all forshadowed by nauseous feeling which is in turn caused by an event, and all these events are similar in nature. These events ALWAYS have to do with someone else doing something I would never personally do. I don't think it's just anxiety because I've notice throughout my life, even as I child, I always preferred to be in control of others, subconcious I think to make them act how I want them to act. Not in a malicious sense but I would usually try to host get togethers, be the leader in childhood games, and recently I've been getting into DMing D&amp;D.

What I find is when someone else does something I wouldn't normally do I feel like my brain puts myself in their shoes and I get a nauseous feeling thinking about how they're doing something I'd never do. As an example my boyfriend smokes weed but since I've grown up in a household where my dad would smoke excessive amounts of weed the thought of myself doing it makes me feel nauseous almost, but what's odd is I get the same emotion when my boyfriend smokes it. I have a few more examples but the pattern is always:


1) Someone does something I wouldn't ever want to do

2) I get nauseous

3) I get emotional

4) I begin critizing myself 

5) Repeat steps 3 and 4


So does anyone know what mental illness this may be? I thought it might be OCD of some form but I don't know.

This is a tricky one. I’ve been on an antipsychotic for all but one of the 13 years my diagnosis has been a personality disorder.

Paranoid PD is one of those  where psychosis, can occur, like  borderline PD, but is not defined in the  diagnostic manuals as a  psychotic disorder.

I think it’s a very grey area. Technically I don’t have a psychotic  disorder according to my diagnosis but I’ve been variously described as  having 'psychotic symptoms ’ , and some delusional thoughts that are  controlled by medication.

35,"A little background - I'm a 25YO male living with his parents.  I have struggled with mental illness for half of my life.  I was diagnosed with depression and obsessive compulsive disorder at age 12, but, aside from a couple months back in 2005, I have never been on medication or attended therapy.

My mental health has been on a steady downward spiral since my mid to late teens.  I quit public school when I was 15 due to issues with bullying and have been more or less a recluse since then.  I haven't had a friend since I was 15 and have only left my home once in the last 5 years, which only happened because I was having chest pains and needed a trip to the ER.

I stopped talking around 3 years ago.  I'm not entirely sure why I stopped.  I felt like I had to for my own safety but I don't understand why I feel that way.  I see my parents almost every day since I live with them, but only ever communicate with them via notes.  

I have these thoughts that have been holding me hostage for around 7 years.  I last saw my sister on the 4th of July, 2011 and can no longer interact with her because I think she's trying to force me to kill myself.  She visits my parents nearly every day for hours on end and I lock myself in my room because I'm terrified of what will happen if she sees or hears me.  It's bad enough where I keep an empty vodka bottle by my bed to urinate in because I can't walk 10 feet out of my room to get to the bathroom even if she's on the opposite end of the house.  I lock myself in my room and beat myself with my fist and scratch my arms and legs bloody.  

A couple years ago I went to take a drink from my water bottle when I was overcome with a feeling that my father was trying to poison me.  Logically I knew that he wasn't, but I couldn't shake the feeling and I had to throw away the bottle.  This was a big deal for me since I can't leave my house to get another one and had to leave a note asking my mom to pick one up from the grocery store.

I've been having some self-harm thoughts that I think are related to my OCD.  There's a scissor that my mom keeps in the bathroom and I sometimes look at it and have thoughts of cutting off my genitals.  The thought horrifies me but I can picture the entire act in my mind.  

I have these thoughts racing through my head that aren't really thoughts... if that makes sense.  I can't really describe it more accurately.  It's like my inner dialogue.  If I think ""I want a sandwich,"" I can hear myself repeating it back to me in my head.  These other thoughts, though, feel like they are not my own.  The voice repeating them back to me isn't mine.  It doesn't have the same accent as I do and doesn't use the terminology that I would think in.  I think that this too is related to my OCD but worry sometimes that it could be something more serious.

I feel like I have to get my issues sorted out soon as my parents are both dealing with serious medical problems right now and I don't know what would happen if they were to die or become unable to care for me.  

I don't know how to broach the subject with my parents.  As I said, I no longer speak, and this seems like something awfully heavy to just lay out in a note.  They know nothing of my more serious problems as I have been afraid that they would force treatment if they found out.  

Should I lay out some of my problems in the note?  Should I just leave a basic ""I'd like an appointment with a psychiatrist?""  How can I psyche myself up and make sure that I don't back out of it?  I KNOW that I need it at this point.  I needed it years ago before it got this bad.  How do I make it happen?

Thanks.",19Aug2018,1,
36,"Someone I met in the prison I mean ""hospital"" I was placed in: A young, exhausted, &amp; overworked new mom arrived. She had argued with her husband earlier that day, and in the midst of the argument she had scratched her arm with her car keys. The scratch was VERY superficial, not even bleeding. Clearly not a suicide attempt or anything close. So she goes to a counseling center owned by this same hospital and says she's overwhelmed, stressed, marriage issues, and wants information on counseling. Because of the scratch on her arm, they immediately committed her and booked her as an inmate. Now she couldn't even nurse her newborn. Do y'all agree that she brought this on herself as well??

So many criminals are Men. The majority, apparently. 

And testicles, i hate them. 
So many people make fun of them, always hitting them In some movies and so.. Why do people find it funny? I hate it. 
Ive never had bad experience with them, I almost wish that i could rip them off tho. 

I hate this gender. I cant accept myself.

For most of us there will times in our lives that are difficult or hurtful in some way. 
We may, for instance, have lost a loved one, be diagnosed with a serious illness, be painfully lonely and lost. 
Our reactions to these events will to some extent be dependent on our individual strengths and resources. 
Many people will become somewhat depressed / anxious due to the radical change in their circumstances. It is not unusual to have this adjustment reaction. 
However, for many it can be severe and prolonged causing intense emotional pain and giving rise to physical and psychological symptoms. 
We can become trapped in our own mental prison, in a constant cycle of negative and self depreciative thoughts which self perpetuate. 
This mindset can colour all that we perceive around us. 
We can feel helpless, weak and vulnerable to any intrusion from the outside world which is why many hide themselves away, both physically and emotionally. 
The future may seem bleak and intimidating , the present moment may be filled with fear and dread.
At our lowest ebb, it seems life becomes a living, dark nightmare from which escape is impossible. 
We lose perspective and forget what life can hold for us 

Did you forget the radiant sunrise at the dawn of the day? 
Did you forget the gleeful looks of your loved ones when you entered the room?
Did you forget the powerful roar of ocean waves as they are thrown ashore? 
Did you forget Nature's seasonal masterpieces?
The crystal like frost of Winter, 
The gentle awakening and resurrection of the flora and fauna in Springtime. 
The warm Summer sun giving rise to the fruition of Gaia herself as she manifests at her zenith.
The subtle encroachment of Autumn as the leaves colours become almost iridescent and the cool, damp chill of the morning air.

No matter how wounded we are we can still experience the wonders of our world. 
We can still get excited about an impending celebration. 
We can still stare in awe at the Moon in the pitch black night sky. 
We can still cherish the love of other humans and animals.
We can still discover new and life changing experiences providing we are open to them.
By their very nature wounds heal. 
It may take time depending on the severity but it will. 
The deeper wounds may leave scars.
Scarred skin is more resilient and tougher than skin that has not been wounded.

So if you are sitting there in your darkest night of your soul, unable to see the way forward. 
Rest assured that if you have patience and give yourself the opportunity, this time will pass.
You will learn from this experience as your life begins to improve. 
For if ever it happens again, you will know that you can again triumph and win your life back.",19Aug2018,66,

I'm a 22 year old female, just finished college and started full time work in June so I'm in this job just around 2 months. I have always been a very positive person up until the last few weeks.

1 background: im 12 im a male i live in isreal with a loveing family and alot of money, i got bullied often at school, i made someone bleed and then made the school think it was someone else, i planned on how to kill my teacher but never did it, (she was a total bitch) i was very shy but im starting to be less and less shy. i hate everyone around me exept my 1 friend and sister. and i never feel bad when something happens to people ""close"" to me ive never been in love. and after our school gave us a break i never left the house i hate talking to EVERYONE, every party every meal you name it its been bad and unfun. the reason im so good at english is because im at my desktop all day, i have an amazing pc my parants give me shit for being at home all the time and i dont plan on changing. ive also never been in love, one girl at my school was in love with me i think but i hated her. my sense of humor is very dry and sacastic and i dont feel anybody really gets me exept myself

2 empathy:
Dont feel it. had alot of times were i think people  deserve to die and i want to be the one to kill them. making someone bleed is fun to me, and calling somebody a cunt or just offending them is np for me i enjoy being a dick and i had a few times were i was a total dick.  
When i killed animals for fun i never felt anything i saw other people care, though i dont understand why anybody would care for people or animals. and lieing is almost a hobby for me and a fun one at that

3 narcissist :
I think im just better then other people smarter mostly. but when somebody says im smart i dont really care i just get board, when somebody says nice thing (the girl from earlyler always said she loves me and that im handsome) i aviod those people i just laugh at people who are ignorant. but i dont know how to say nice things to other people, i just dont see why say nice things. but i also hate myself because of the person that i am, i can never get anything done, the fact that youre reading this makes me fucking hyped,  but i dont know how to be better, and nobody has ever helped me with my self hatred but ive often feel like im god somehow

2. I think I'm smart, but cannot seem to achieve much. I am good at sketches, but cannot seem to commit to finishing many drawings.

*please always consult with your health care provider/primary care physician/licensed psychologist/psychiatrist/etc before you make any medical choices regarding your mental health symptoms. I am not licensed to treat any of these things...

I pride myself on being as natural and holistic  as possible when it comes to my body and health, so finding remedies that exclude pharmaceuticals is rather exciting for me, and I want to share what is working for me so far. You can research any of these things yourself as well! 

So here are all the herbs/supplements that I have been taking and have  been helping me manage/decrease my depression/depressive symtoms:

*Ashwaganda: adaptogen- helps stress relief &amp; regulate hormones/cortisol levels 
*Valerian: helps sleep 
(These two I believe helped me sleep for the first time in weeks!) 
*Multivitamin (mainly for the folate and chromium... although b12 and vitamin D are known to help as well) 
*Diindolylmethane (DIM): helps with estrogen 
metabolism and balancing hormones 
*St John’s Wort: has shown benefits in treating depression (do your own research!!!!!) 
*DHA/EPA (aka fish oil): shown to help those with depressive symptoms 
*I also take an herbal supplement I got from my acupuncturist. I’m not sure the name of it (it’s in Chinese &amp; I can’t read it!), but it’s a blend of Angelica Root, Peony, Gardenia, Indian Bread, Tree Peony, Thorowax Root, Atractylodes Rhizome, Mint and Ginger. 

Along with these, I cut out caffeine by about 95%, exercise regularly, try to consume only healthy foods (again, about 95%... little to no processed or artificial food), drink caffeine free tea daily and try to spend as much time outdoors as my schedule allows.

62,Recently I started logging my mood everyday. Here's an article I wrote about why I am finding it useful. [https://www.moodcheckin.com/blog/why-mood-tracking-is-important](https://www.moodcheckin.com/blog/why-mood-tracking-is-important),19Aug2018,6,
63,"For a while, I have been struggling with this problem where I won't eat, or just forget to eat. Especially when my depression and anxiety flares up I don't have any interest in eating, I didn't really know how to describe it, and actually last night I was with my two best friends and I was trying to describe it to them but it was hard to. I didn't know the term for it. Today, I was scrolling thru Reddit and in a post discussion someone mentioned ARFID. It sounded really similar to what I was experiencing, and I researched it more. I think that I do have it, and it perfectly describes what I couldn't put a name to before.

For a year now, I have an alarm reminders set on my phone to remind me to eat. Because otherwise I just won't. Its not that I think i'm overweight, I know I am way thinner than most. And I know that continuing not to eat is just going to make it worse. But I have to force myself to eat. Today I just had some apple sauce so that I could at least digest something. But the thought of eating cereal or actual food makes me want to puke. Some days it will be close to evening and realize I haven't eaten anything. Like I just completely forget to. The other week I was in a tattoo shop to get a piercing and right before I ended up passing out because I didn't eat anything at all that day. But it especially gets really bad when combined with depression and anxiety. I have been in a funk lately due to some things, and the thought of eating food makes me nauseous or just not endearing to me at all. The other day I went out to dinner with my mom and I only ate like 4 bites of my pasta, I felt bad but I just really don't have any appetite. Two years ago, my room mate would have to force me to eat or remind me to because I wouldn't. 

I never knew this was a disease, or a thing until now. Im glad I can finally pinpoint what it is, because I didn't know how to describe it to anyone. 

Does anyone have any advice on how they handle it? This has now hit me like a wall.",19Aug2018,1,
64,"   So i’ve been experiencing what i think is OCD, but I have the constant need to confess something. Mostly towards my girlfriend because we’ve been together for quite awhile. As time went on this urge came out of me making me feel like if i didn’t do it i’m the worst boyfriend in the world. I’m tired of feeling this very feeling because I feel like it’s effecting our relationship. She feels fine about it, but i’m anxious as hell. Anyway to treat whatever I have? Or identify whatever I have?",19Aug2018,3,
65,"I feel like I have a mashed potato for a brain. Over the weekend I didn't do shit but lay down and think about what's wrong with me. I have no emotions and just walking through life broken. I wouldn't be posting here if this didn't bother me becuase it does. It has taken a huge toll on my life. I have no social life, I stutter when trying to talk, draw a lot of blanks when speaking and cannot remember anything for the life of me. I try and stay positive but cant for more than a couple hours or so than go back to a shitty attitude. I feel like I have a fog in my brain that prevents me from thinking and acting clearly. Anyone have experience with a foggt brain? Or experience with not feeling ""there""?",19Aug2018,61,
66,"Does anyone else have this problem? Mornings and early afternoon are the worst part of the day for me. Especially with all of this heat. Today fortunately its overcast and kind of rainy and nice. But of course, my depression and anxiety is still almost as bad. I stay up until usually 3 or 4 am because I like night time the best, thats when my mind is most at ease. I struggle with BPD, depression, anxiety, eating problems - anything you name it. In the mornings i'm usually so moody, and usually is my time for ""lashing"" out at people. I send the meanest texts in the mornings, feel the worst, super insecure, depressed about someone not giving me attention - what have you. The first moment I open my eyes from sleep, is the worst. Kind of like knowing I have to conquer yet another day in this world aka hell. Night time is the best, because I feel like everyone is asleep, Im completely alone, and I have no responsibilities. Ill listen to music and watch things or browse the internet. Its the best time. I feel like I hear a lot of people talk about how night time is the worst for them and how thats when they usually get in their head, but for me its early day. Anyone else have this problem? 

Im moving to Philly wednesday this week, and I haven't done anything, I wanted to go to goodwill to find some things for my apartment, but I have been a blob and too depressed to leave the house or get ready to go somewhere. I don't really feel like packing or taking care of anything right now. Its so bad. Does anyone have any advice? Help",19Aug2018,2,

However I spoke to one of her older friends who said that she was probably lying about a lot of things. So, I did some googling. She claims she has panic attacks every day for one hour each day. That would make them last twice the average time and happen 7 times as often. Can someone who’s familiar with this subject DM me so that we can discuss a few of these statements? If you don’t have the time, just leave a quick comment telling if this is possible/likely.

73,"18/m, since I was around 11 I have been struggling with mental health. I've had some issues come and go over the years... social anxiety, mild depression, mild OCD, more severe anxiety, more severe depression, and often I'd find my mood randomly going down from 100 to 0 in minutes. I would say 95% of the time I'm fine then 5% of the time I'm incredibly depressed, considering suicide, etc.

Thought for a while the mood swings were completely random, but after a couple appointments with my GP she said she thinks I simply suffer from low self-esteem. I thought it couldn't be that, but after thinking about it, it makes \*so much sense\*. Every time I've 'randomly' got depressed it's been linked to something hurting my ego slightly.

So now I've identified it (I think), but I don't know what to do about it. It really cripples me sometimes. Earlier today a couple friends I was hanging out with joked that I walk strangely (I hunch my back a lot and look down at the ground when walking usually) and I went to the toilet and started pinching myself hard, something I often do when I get overwhelmed, but I genuinely can't walk anymore without feeling like everyone's judging me for the way I walk. I'm so sick of feeling this depressed over tiny things which anybody else would just be able to laugh off.

Things like somebody opening a message I've sent and not replying to it often triggers a depressive episode for me too.

My dad has called me pathetic on a few occasions when I start randomly crying, so I feel bad for just getting upset, and it all just spirals downwards.

I'm really tired of having such violent mood swings over tiny things. I think I'll start private therapy, but it's so expensive, and I'm not even sure if it will work. If I try therapy and it doesn't work I feel like I may just give up completely. My doctor said she doesn't think meds are worth trying because of my age and the side effects, and the fact that most of the time I'm okay.

I keep thinking about suicide -- it's more of a fantasy than anything, but I keep thinking how I won't have to . Nobody will be able to judge me any more. Everything weird or cringey I've ever done won't matter. But the weird thing is I know I'll wake up in the morning feeling a bit better, and by the end of tomorrow I'll probably be fine.

Any advice on this would be incredibly appreciated, or anybody just wanting to chat.

Thanks a lot :)",19Aug2018,1,

it happened the other day, it was intense and hit me like a wave. i remember looking around me, everything in my kitchen looking normal.....but not. i knew i was in my house, that i was stood in my kitchen, but it looked....different? unreal? artificial and like it didn't belong to me, like i was unfamiliar with it? as if it was somewhere i hadn't been before?

my body itself then started to feel strange. not only did my surroundings become somewhat unfamiliar, so did my ""shell"". i remember then waving my hands infront of my face, moving my fingers with intent as to reassure must that i was in control. i jiggled my limbs to try and remind myself. ""these are my legs? yes, those are my legs. what about my arms? do they belong to me? they do, i can move them, see?"". it lasted a while, 15 minutes or so before fading away.

77,"Venting/confessing because I feel that I have no one to talk to anymore. I’ve been self harming since 7th grade (currently going into 12th) but went almost a full year without it. This year has been considerably harder for me than the other years for reasons, too long of stories to go through right now. I have the urge to self harm very frequently now when I didn’t before.  In the beginning of this last school year I stopped cutting for reasons of getting better and because I felt like I didn’t need to, but now I feel like I need to even more but haven’t been able to because my sister is getting married soon and I’m in her wedding. It feels like my depression is the absolute worst it has ever been. I’ve never been diagnosed but it’s pretty apparent to me that I have some form of depression. Usually I’m not depressed for full length days, usually just parts of it.  I’ll have ups and downs but my “downs” are extreme enough to the point where I’m extremely suicidal and it feels like my heart sinks all the way down in my chest and I could cry for hours on end until I somehow snap out of it but for my “ups” I’m completely normal and fine. I think I may be bipolar but I’m not sure. I hope to get therapy after my sisters wedding is over, but don’t want to before then because everyone in my family is so busy right now. This is sort of a mess to read but it’s just what was on my mind, I don’t really even know why I’m doing this, just in a bad place right now.  ",19Aug2018,1,

82,"So, I (f24) recently got a new house! Yay! It was mostly to get more space because two people on 18m2 doesn't really work. The other person is my partner(m26), who has been dealing with a pretty heavy depression for the last 2.5 years, 1.5 of those with anti-depressants (currently on them). He has improved over time, but any form of stress is still a big trigger for him. Now even though moving is a good thing, it brings a large amount of stress with it. 
Because of this he is largely unable to help, and feels really bad about it. It also causes me to do less moving stuff and more helping/soothing him stuff. 
I would love to have him out of the house for a couple of days, so I can focus on getting this move over with. The problem is that I don't know how to talk to him about this. He already feels guilty af for not helping, and I'm really afraid of making it worse by telling him he's in the way. Also, I am his main safe haven, and I would be taking that away if I send him to his parents for a couple of days...

It's been like this all my life. I've been to psychotherapy for 3 years, and am taking anti-depression pills.

I've always been elevated above my peers. Got top grades in my class. Strangers immediately love my company. Being around me is described as deeply inspiring. My work is what I love doing. I meditate. I have no financial problems. I have a fantastic girlfriend who loves and supports me. I have parents who think the world of me.

When my second therapist didn't support my claim that I had a PTSD, I felt the same. I mean who would want to have a mental illness, right? It's better to not have BPT or PTSD, right?

The truth is I don't feel adequate and that there is some fault with my brain wiring. That said, yesterday my friends performance triggered me that I having been able to stop crying. When I finally come back to my senses, it felt like a bad hangover.

I do have abandonment issues. And things like the death of the loved ones or rejection is triggering. I don't intend to be triggers. It's a very automatic response.

90,"So to be brief I have anxiety issues that have been around since life, and I recently developed depression, I’m pretty sure.

Anyway, my living situation hasn’t been well living with hoarders and I a few instances come to mind:

* I woke up livid one day because I am basically compelled to live in a bad situation because I can’t afford to move.

* I am verbally/emotionally abused by my parents with threats on the basis of being kicked out/violence against me.

I think I dissociated at some point?

I remember being confused awhile back. I can’t remember how long ago maybe 2-4 weeks ago? I was just so perplexed at how I failed to save my money and couldn’t afford to move out, and has to live in a crappy situation because my parents are hoarders and negate responsibility basically.

Anyway, I tried reaching for support on /r/hoarding. I ironically was burned after a few posts… I express that my parents make very poor decisions and therefore because of his decisions they made I called them ‘dumb’. The moderator got pretty offended (I could only assume he was a massive hoarder). My response was:

“So if I’m depressed and I punch someone one day, do we just say ‘eh, he’s depressed... oh well’ and ignore it?”

That was the vibe I was getting from the w
hoarding sub.

I’m perfectly aware that my life is my responsibility, though I find it distressing that I reach out to support and:

1. One line of support, someone who I thought I could rely on for life: “That’s not my problem”. Ironically, everyone has issues, not every issue is solvable by one person but, they failed to realize that.

2. The second line of support claimed they didn’t know what to do, I offered suggestions on helping me. I clearly didn’t expect this person to just solve my problem while I sit on my ass or something. When I mentioned this on a support to that sub I mentioned, they claimed I was somehow pushing my issues onto someone else. Obviously what everyone says isn’t true. Basic logic says if I have a problem but I can’t so myself, I ask someone. Very simple.

Anywho, a few weeks ago my OCD obsessions about my fear of ‘going insane’ possibly led me to dissociate. Obviously my lack of support didn’t help as well. Now with my ‘support’ I have now, things clearly aren’t going well.

One day I was contemplating how things got so bad, and how I failed to save any money. Well, I think I became hypochondriacal about the fear of insanity. Why? I know and I’ve heard of some very strange people. One person I know makes jokes about death and killing, and the other person I know claims he can absorb energy from the stars and other far-fetched shit. The person who makes jokes about morbid stuff, he never respected my boundary when I said ‘stop’.

Anyway one day I started worrying if somehow I could be dreaming or something. Something just didn’t feel right, why the hell is everyone acting so strange? Obviously I don’t think I’m psychotic or anything like that, I’m well aware that this is real life, but it’s like things seem so intense, it’s hard to believe people make such poor decisions, myself included. 

My siblings simply offered the vague advice:

“Save money and move out!”

They never mentioned: how much, what percentage, what qualifies as an emergency fund, how much to invest, how to keep expenses low, how to avoid being homeless, how to care for your own well-being, or any of that. I feel like with their advice, they might as well have said:

“Making money lets you do stuff”, about as vague as that.

**tl;dr: Too much stress made my anxiety spike, made me develop depression, made me dissociate, and I’m getting no real advice from anyone beyond the obvious.**

Decide to walk away and take a break, or to fix a cup of tea, or something.  Those are adult options, not kid options.  Kids are lucky if they're allowed to get up and go to the bathroom and not just told to hold it.

I guess I'm wondering...what realistic advice could someone have given teenage me on coping?  I didn't have a supportive adult in my life that I could talk to and that could be trusted to not take things back to my parents - who would have made all the right supportive noises and then made things worse.

I mentioned self-harm mostly, but I think even in general, pretty much every tip on health emotional coping I've seen is for either adults or for kids who have adults who want to help them learn emotional coping skills.",19Aug2018,36,
