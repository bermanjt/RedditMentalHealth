I always get paranoid that I have schizophrenia every time I read or watch a video about it, so I was kind of on edge at the time of watching it. I looked up at a picture of my parents and me when I was five years old, and my mother’s face caught my eye. It looked like she was staring straight into my soul through the picture, so I freaked out and instinctively left the room. I’m going to remove the picture from my room because it scared me so much. This happened a few minutes ago as of the making of this post, and I’m still getting chills just thinking about her face in the picture. I’m a 16 year old male, and my parents are still alive.

I had an opportunity to start going to a psychiatrist which started with a few visits to a counselor. Then I had to start working out of town and I never got another chance to see the psychiatrist. 
The two sessions I had with the counselor were not great. As soon as I was in that environment, I crumpled into a pile of nerves and pretty much just cried and couldn't even look her in the face.

6,"Hi! I’m not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I’ve received great articles and info from previous posts on this sub before. TLDR at the bottom.

I’m a 32/f living in the Midwest in the US, diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD. I am currently taking medications prescribed to be for all of these issues/illnesses.  I’m also 33 days sober from alcohol, alone Mon-Fri as my husband (married 1 year) travels for work. I do work full-time, but the nights are lonely and I’m a bit of recluse due to my recent sobriety and smaller friend circle.

Now that you have a little background info on me, on February 21st of this year, my older brother suddenly passed away from an accidental drug overdose. Our relationship was close off and on (off during his heavy drug usage years), and we had been spending a lot of time together just days prior to his death and even texting hours before the overdose  (he was clean, from what I saw and knew). The toxicology report is still pending, and I have a feeling this will give me a little closure in some way. I was his next of kin, so I was the last one to see him at the hospital, he was deceased before he even made it there. 

My question is, aside from continuing my medication plan, avoiding alcohol, and therapy (I go once a week alone, and about twice a month with my husband), what else can I do to help relieve the many moods and emotions I am going through? I am an avid reader, and open to suggestions for books, websites, groups, articles, and/or anything you may feel appropriate. And secondly, how can I be a better support system for my mother who lost her only son and first born? She lives 1,000 miles away and is also somewhat reclusive. 

Thanks for reading, anything helps.

TLDR; I suffer from depression, am being treated for it and in therapy, and recently lost my brother due to an overdose. What resources are useful and available to help ease the pain or give some understanding or closure, as well as be there for my long distance mother?",03Apr2018,1,
7,"Trigger warning for those who've experienced panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, or have self-harmed.


Long day... one thing after another. After months of an ex-friend making my life miserable after becoming my roommate, today takes the cake. Already anxious from dumping milk all over my poor and and breaking a shot glass a few minutes later, waking up my bf's brother by doing the dishes and having him yell at us later... well, after all that, I planned on going to bed but the roommate, let's call her Briana, comes downstairs and bitches at us over us doing the dishes that I didn't know were already clean, about us not doing this that and the other thing even though this last week I've been trying to step back up despite not having the motivation for anything. I just found out this morning too that she had been telling lies to my bf's  (and her bf, my bf's brother) mom and my own about all these petty things I had never done or she took the wrong way. Eg; I bought my favorite fragrant flowers to brighten up the place... forgetting she was highly allergic since its been mentioned ONCE. She's saying I'm mean to her kids who I never even see when they're here and I just don't know where any of it is coming from. Well between finding out what she's been saying and dealing with my emotions from the day on top of her bitching, I snapped. And got yelled at by my bf' s other brother, let's call him Chris. He didn't think what I said was called for and I'm not sure if it was because I'm starting to feel like a huge piece of shut that deserved him screaming at me. He used to like me but apparently after today no one respects my bf and no one cares about me. We can't leave because my bf has money tied to the house. After getting yelled at by Chris and Briana I was going up to bed when I heard Briana's bf and my bf/Chris's brother, let's call him DJ, get home. Whatever I was already heading upstairs. Not two seconds later I'm in the bathroom getting ready for bed and my bf knocks and asks me to come back downstairs. I already know what's coming. More screaming, screaming I can't handle after everything else today. I start hyperventilating, and before I know if I'm falling against the wall my limbs tingly and limp. My bf got into the bathroom and comforted me and ultimately went down and faced DJ's wrath for me. While he was gone I scratched myself til I bled and pulled my hair out because I just couldn't feel it and I needed to stay lucid and I didn't know how else to besides causing myself pain. Now after the fight with his brother, the bf doesn't want to be here either, but has told me we have to clean everything and do everything and not speak unless spoken too, and we can't have any freetime until we can get the house on the market. I'm So scared that's never going to happen and I'm more scared that I'm going to end up killing myself before i ever see the end of this chapter of my life. I don't know what to do but no one knows I have a Reddit and I needed to tell someone that I am in great pain, I don't know what to do. How to I convince him that we shouldn't stay here? That his family hates us both now and we're never going to be free to leave unless we just go. 
I'm too exhausted to know if any of that made sense and this is my first time on reddit. Sorry if you wasted time reading this.

Because of this, one of my greatest fears is being institutionalized/my mom finding out how bad things are.

I’m worried that my therapist will have to report them to my mom as a threat to myself/institutionalize me.

Can anyone say if my fears are realistic or not? I’m sorry if this is a weird question.

Lately I’ve been having some very strange panic attacks. Symptoms include: 

-hallucinations of people/lights/buildings 

-feeling like my mind is being read by “them”

-“knowing” that I’m in a simulation 

-being unable to be around technology, because it’s “their” way of reading my mind

-whenever I touch something, I have a freak out because it somehow connects me to “them”

16,"So to shorten some of this story /rant... 

history of suicidal thoughts - attempts - 3, depression since age 7... ptsd since last summer.. yadda yadda im a hot mess 

after feeling like no one gave a shit after moving for like the 2nd or 3rd time i decided to go through ALL my fb friends and delete those i couldnt remember or felt didnt care about me or i didnt trust. - i deleted like 1000 fb friends. 

another side story - had a guy ask me for a pet portrait - i finished it .. but never answered texts or emails or msgs about paying for it and when to mail it.. so i had to tag him in a fb status.. 

other notes - i do more than pop art (will come up later )
for an idea - art on fb and instagram is under Eskine Art 

other notes ; went thru 3 rounds of bad roommates who all chose to move out and skip out on bills and rents because -- get ready for it - they did not want to clean or pick up after themselves - when the last 2 were not on the lease. Last ones (was a now ex friend and his gf, who trashed the place, stole some of my furniture and dishware and abandoned their cat.. also broke my moms air mattress they refused to refund the exact price or replace) - last ones i was just fed up with having to lose my deposit and also having to owe the complex $850 PLUS $200 i spent on cleaning it - so i posted the pics of the unit as they left it and put it on fb. - also 1st roomies didn't last a month because they skipped out cause one of them realized she felt bad i caught her and the other going to a party at my cousins and totally not letting me know and i just called her out... and she gave me the cold shoulder and like a child decided she didn't want to live their anymore.. the other quoted britney spears on all my boards and then skipped out too - after i took care of her 2 dogs who were covered in fleas for 3 days straight


*BREATHES* 

sooooo  then got shit cause i started 2 gofundme's for 2 separate times when roommates skipped out because i would of been homeless ----- as of now i have been homeless 3 times.. IT SUCKS and believe i FIGHT MY ASS OFF AT WORK to prevent it from happening again - i have my own dog walking gig that pays great now. Being in college full time and working i couldnt pull an extra 600 out my ass at the last minute 

i also had a gofundme for hw meds for a dog i found until i found her owners or a new home - long story short .. my rescue helped out and i ended up keeping her and doing a slow hill treatment after i got her back to health and got rid of parasites and got her shots. (no other rescues could take her at the time) 

but yeah heard some ppl said i was a scammer - 

had a sarahah years later after that - which was recently after a bad summer - had a dog bite me in the face at the dog park, then got mugged at my front door - June 22 2017 - which was the exact anniversary of the day i rescued the dog prev mentioned. 

i mostly got negative shit 
see here - https://imgur.com/a/xgnWl





*notes* btw i have no idea who these ppl are , i was also stalked and harassed by a judgmental facebook profile on fb. I have been doing art since i was 9 and worked a summer or 2 as an art instructor to ages 6 and up. 

but yeah anyway... 

Here is my rant etc what i need advice on and what is bothering me : 

Nothing like stumbling upon your screenshots of all the hate mail you got from your sarahah account. Sweet.... instant depression, self loathing and insecurity. It still bothers me SO MUCH to not know who said all this crap. I could have had an adult conversation but of course no one had the balls or knew me well enough to know I could sit and listen and try to understand their point of view - even when its hateful. 

But i guess i was asking for it. But main thing that bothers me is not knowing if those ppl were those i legit placed worth in or just some acquaintances that knew nothing about me or bought whatever crap ex-roommates who bounced out on me said when a majority of them chose to move out before paying rent and bills because they didn't want to pick up after themselves like an adult.

This will piss me off til the end of time, even though I know I believe in karma. But the paranoia this has caused me is why i am so untrusting of old friends and have become introverted. 

even when you are fair and honest, not everyone will be the same to you. I am no longer naive in seeing the good in people. I feel i have to be a lone wolf still. I have lost faith in God and in people, but gained a lot of faith in myself. I know the friends that do step up and do come off genuine are those I can invest in and trust. 

trying to convince someone that you are nothing they think you are is a waste of time. but with my anxiety disorder and the ptsd from my mugging and the stressful past few years... like shit. Sometimes you can't win with people. Sometimes you have to wipe crap clean and say -

 IDGAF, ima still be kind and real, honest and loving. if you wanna be two -faced , go ahead ... but I'll continue to be myself regardless of others. I just need to find myself again, keep working on my life and proving others and myself wrong. Maybe I will open up to old friends again. But yeah. I just know who is on my shit-list for life and i know to stay away from them and anyone who associates themselves with them. I have a ex roommate that has haunted my dreams lately, mostly because i heard she killed one of her dogs and I think it was the one i let her adopt from me. (she got a diff dog later after she moved out and abandoned her cat and trashed my apartment, had no idea what happened to the one i let her adopt from me)

 If so, that dog's death is on my hands.. and i will kick her scrawny ass if i ever see her again. And every pic of him i have leaves me sick to my stomach. I failed to protect an innocent life for the first time in my life. And I won't forgive myself or this girl. Not to mention she was cheating and lying on her bf - who was my friend while she was living with me. 

I guess ppl love gossip. Some ppl who can't fathom someone being open about their life online finds it offensive or appalling to be so ""real"" . And god forbid someone have a bad day or some crazy shit happens and they talk about it online. 

I have changed ALOT every year through ALLLLLL the bs i have been through. 

the major change that helped me was getting rid of all the toxic ppl I KNEW in my life. but when you don't know who the toxic ppl are... it messes with your mind. 

I don't understand how fake ppl who have just no personalities live with themselves with just gossiping and bad talking people all day. Just all day negative or boastful. I HATE those ppl. Yet those kind of people were in my life cause i wanted to see the good in people. I saw good friends as close friends. I boosted up ppl more than i should of. 

I don't associate or talk to most of my family for certain reasons so I have always said friends were my family. This is still true, but as previously stated - i thought more of my friendships and friends than i should of. 

So yeah i don't know where to go from here other than re-learning how to love myself and figuring out where i could or should start over a social life after i graduate college. I think im successful with my current job, i have plans to keep going with my art and get serious about my Digital Art Degree and illustrations.. but i may not need the degree idk.. 

im just.. frustrated.. mad and lost. 

i try my best of be positive and make sure i dont act like a victim when i am having a bad day but overall... i just would vent out loud to fb because thats how i communicated more and more as years went by . 

ugh i jsut dont know what to do about myself and how to have a social life again or if i should even try until i just move. I just want to be happy, successful and have my own revenge by proving others wrong. ",03Apr2018,2,

Another problem is that she struggles severely with her own mental health problems and has nearly killed herself twice and has been taken advantage of about 6 months after. I know I'm not the only person she can talk to, but I gave her a home when she was 16 and she's like a sister also. 

She is able to meet this lad and that lad with no hassle yet she doesn't notice the person who's been there through it all, meanwhile I can't connect with people because I don't like the thought of anyone else knowing how I feel. I'm incredibly lonely and I'm really struggling.

 I have been able to figure out other things about myself from trying to understand what's happening to me then looking it up(self diagnosed Alice in Wonderland syndrome) and even though it never really bothered me it helped putting a name to it and being able to understand it. but bad memory is really hard especially at my age where it is mostly assumed that teens and people in their 20's with bad memory are just overselling it (like they forgot where they put their keys so now they think they have Alzheimer). but for me it is truly bad.

My memory has affected my life. after a period of time (I don't know why or how long) I will forget things. for example one thing that bothers me is when family member ask me if I remember a certain time me did a certain thing (even if supposedly we only did it a couple of months ago) and I would have absolutely no Idea what they are talking about so either I end up just nodding my head and moving on, or I will listen to a story about something that I did (this really troubles me because I have no memory of it and it feels like I am listening to a story about another person's life). but because of this I sit in the corner and talk to no one for 8 hours then go home, It also makes things like English class really hard for me because I have to make up fake stories for papers, (this doesn't affect me as much since I'm not social) but it makes it hard for me to have conversations with people since I never have any stories to tell. 

I am assuming that this is beyond just a normal 20yo with normal memory, I can live with this just fine, just being the inquisitive type I would like to know a little about what is going on in my head.

27,"Long-ish backstory, sorry.

My entire life I have just accepted the fact that my older brother will always be mean, will always argue, will always isolate himself. Since he was a teenager he has gone through several therapists and medication treatments. Sometimes he is told he could be on the autism spectrum, sometimes he is told he could be dealing with bipolar disorder, etc. I do know that he suffers from severe anxiety and depression. He is able to hold a job and be functional around strangers but incapable of being civil to the people who are close to him.

I’m not trying to diagnose him, just giving some background into what I have dealt with my whole life with him. As I have gotten older, the way he has treated me, my siblings, and my parents has dramatically worsened. He feels he is the black sheep of the family and that he never got the support he needed. He resents any family member who is more successful than he is, since he is the oldest sibling. 

It’s hard to understand him, because I really don’t know what is going on in his head. 

He is abusive to his girlfriend. He doesn’t let you talk to him unless you walk on eggshells and don’t dare talk about anything he might not like, or else he will explode. He is manipulative. He will be horrifically rude to me, but tell me I have made him suicidal if I respond rudely as well. He will use my insecurities against me to try to cut me down. He has said things that I did not believe a family member could say to me. It’s very difficult to just say, “these are things he said when he was having an episode. They don’t mean anything.” Because he can control himself when he wants to, like when he is at work or in public. 

And after all that, he is still my brother and I still want him to get the help he needs. There are obviously more details and complex issues (as is the way it goes with mental health) but I wonder if anyone has a similar experience with a loved one, or advice as to how to personally forgive him and how to understand him a little better.

I've always seen myself as fat, unattractive, and shy, and from my experiences I have no reason to believe otherwise. People tend to be surprised when I tell them my weight (216) and how I feel about it, and they say I've changed a ton since losing 50 lbs, even though I can't see a difference. I always think people are just trying to be nice, I never feel like they are genuine. I don't have any reason to think so, but I do.

 My roommates always try to lift me up, saying that I'm a hot guy and trying to set me up with girls (my own dating attempts have not gone well, which hasn't helped matters). I don't feel like they are being genuine either. They are all attractive and outgoing womanizing guys, I don't think they'd be encouraging me if they thought I was any kind of real competition.

In context of what she is saying, I was on prozac for the majority of my childhood, the I had to transfer to Resperdol, where it backfired, so I was taken off of Resperdol. I tell my mom I can't focus anymore, but she refuses to put me back on prozac, because it gave me nightmares. Is there any tips on how to focus better and what to do with my mom? She says she is not putting me back on any medication, so I'm lost. I understand medication is only a minor part of fixing what I have, but I was way better on the medication I took the majority of my childhood. Today, she got really angry over a wet towel, yelling at me. Someone please give me advice on what do with my mother.  Should I move out and live with my dad, since they are divorced, or should I stay? How would I move out without her noticing? If I stay, I fear my depression will worsen. Even since I lived with her full time, my depression has gotten worse. Please comment and give advice on the situation please.",03Apr2018,2,

44,"I am 17 years old and about to graduate high school.My life is pretty stable as of right now and I feel happy. However there is this problem that haunts me and I face it every time that I am with my boyfriend(who I love more than anything). I guess I should start by saying my bio dad cut off contact with me and my older sister one day completely out of the blue for no reason when I was about 12, he said that if I reached out to him again he would file harassment charges against me and my sister. Towards the end of our relationship he would criticize me constantly and my self esteem really took a beating.I also grew up watching my mom be verbally abused by men over and over again.I saw way too much when I was a child, I saw violence and lots of sexual things that no child my age should've seen. My mom is happily married now to the best guy ever, I am thankful he is my stepdad but I still feel this void that I can never tell him I love you or call him dad just because he came into my life when I was older. That was just background on why I think I'm having issues. So back to my boyfriend, we have been on and off since I was a freshman  because he used to be a dick,for lack of a better word. After not speaking for some time and failed relationships in between, he grew up, got his shit together, and treats me wonderfully.I have never felt more trust and love in someone. Where the problem lies is me. I am a very nice and positive person, BUT I have this really bad tendency to be toxic to  boyfriends. I started to realize it with my last relationship that something was wrong and it wasn't just him. As my current boyfriend points out I nitpick ALOT ,I show affection by being kinda mean,and I tend to just shutdown emotionally whenever we fight or he gets mad at me.I almost don't know how to let myself be happy in a relationship and I have to stir the pot.I  don't even realize that I'm doing half of these things because I think deep down.... I resent men. But I don't consciously think or feel that way, I love my boyfriend so much and he is honestly the person I see myself having a beautiful future with but as of now I can tell I'm wearing him out and making him resent me. He is supportive and wants to help me but a person can only put up with so much. Should I mention that this has happened with all of the other guys I have dated too?? I seriously need help with this trauma and I plan to go to therapy. Your constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",03Apr2018,4,

57,"I currently live with my boyfriend and his dad. I'm 19, unemployed, currently trying to get a job so I can get a car and move out of here with my boyfriend and hopefully get our own apartment.

My boyfriend's dad, I'm going to refer to him as Satan, is lazy, disgusting, abusive emotionally and psychically. He's beaten my boyfriend's mom and has broken her nose (they are no longer together.) He doesn't clean up after himself, he doesn't say please or thank you, he pisses everywhere, he screams at my boyfriend, he throws away all of the food in the house if you argue with him, he threatens to kick out my boyfriend when I argue with him, he threatens to charge my boyfriend unrealistic amounts of 'rent' when I argue with him.

After living with them for around a year and a half now, I recently developed bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder and chronic panic attacks. I was mentally fine until I lived with them. 

Now here's my problem, this fucker is bonkers. He sings loudly when I'm around, as if he's trying to aggravate me. He will sneak up behind me and creep on me when ever I'm out of my room. I try to avoid him as much as possible. He talks about women in horrific ways, calling them fat wh*res and c*nts, and those are just random women he sees in public. He talks about killing animals and how he has done it before. He recently stopped drinking (he owns a bar next door) but he was an alcoholic for around 45 years. Until recently he would come in the house at 2 a.m and scream his head off, cook an entire meal that he wouldn't eat, leave the oven on, and go to bed.

So, today, I decided to clean up the bathroom because no one else will. Halfway through the cleaning process he barges in and watches me clean as he sings. So I get mad and go to my room.
Around 30 minutes later when he's doing something else I go back to the bathroom to clean and I told him we should get a welcome mat and a shoe rack to tidy up. He proceeded to freak out.
he said “i dont want that shit in my house im gonna start charging (my boyfriend) $300 a month, he’s gonna be broke.”

He refuses to clean his own house and the reason is: he doesn't care, he's never here, it's the way of life. He says the house is my boyfriend and I's responsibility.

In reality, he's always here, he won't let me buy things for the house, he won't let me buy cleaning supplies, he leaves everything he touches a disgusting mess.

My boyfriend refuses to stand up for me... and we are in this situation where him, his friend and I could split an apartment three ways, but he refuses because his current living situation with his father aka Satan, would be cheaper. So, I'm supposed to give up my sanity just so my boyfriend doesn't have to spend money...and I get it, I want to get a job and maybe then it'll be easier for us to get a place with his friend. The thing is, he doesn't stand up for me. He yells at me for making his dad upset. And I can't take it much longer. I have no one else to live with.",03Apr2018,1,

I don't really know where to start. It all began when i was 3 yo, my dad left my mom and never came back, so i mostly grew up without him. As i entered adolescence (i was 14 yo), my mom was a bit disturbed, everything wasn't going well in her life, and she rejected most of her frustration towards me. She drank a lot, often yelled at me, sometimes beat the shit out of me. I never really fought back, since i knew it wasn't all her fault. I saw a psychologist without her knowing, and it was a really bad experience. I told him i was frustrated, and sometimes it was hard not to fight back my mom when she was beating me. He told me that wasn't acceptable, and i shouldn't be ever doing that. I felt like he wasn't even interessed in what i had to say, so i stopped going there and never saw a psychologist again. So i kept going, and my mom was becoming even more cruel, telling me i was a little shit, didn't deserved to live and stuff like that. One night i felt full of rage and i destroyed absolutly everything in my bedroom. Obviously, she became mad for it and almost punched me to death that night, not even kidding. After this night i tried to be nicer to her, and to hide my own feelings, because i was scared of her reactions. I often felt full of frustration, anger, and i began to cut myself, it was the only thing that calmed me down. I was bullied at school aswell because i never took any showers (i was leaving house before she was awake, and came back before she came back from work, to stay in my bedroom), never washed my clothes, barely eat (she wouldn't give me food so i mostly had to steal in stores to ear). One day, i couldn't bear this situation anymore. She struck me once again, and this time i just pushed her aside and ran out of the house. This was the last time i saw my mother, she killed herself some time after that. I lived in the streets for a little week, sleeping under a bridge, stealing in stores like i used to do to eat. I got caught on the 6th day i think, told my story to the police, then sent me to a psychiatric hospital, where i stayed 11 days. I took medecine when i was there, and i was feeling very nice, i couldn't overthink, i was feeling so light headed. I told the doctors i didn't want to go back to my mother's house, so they did researches or whatever and found my father. He came, and took me with him. He was married, had a daughter and a wife. It felt really strange, i kinda felt like the ugly duckling and my new relation with this father i never knew was awkward. His wife didn't like me, and they sent me to a residential school. I graduated, then they sent me to a big city, far away from them, payed for my studies, a flat and stuff. But i still felt really bad, i couldn't focus on hard studies ( i tried law and psychology ), i was really feeling down and lacked motivation. So i dropped my studies and worked a bit, mostly in restaurants. But it's been 2 years since i didn't work now. I can't find the motivation, i feel like i only lived horrible things in my life and i struggle to go on. I have troubles getting out of bed, lots of insomnia, i'm feeling physically weak, i have troubles in social relations... I should probably see another psychologist, but i'm scared because of my previous experience. I just want to be happy but i have no clue what to do, i don't know if i have some kind of mental illness, i think i would feel better if i could put words on my situation.

If you ever found the courage to read all of this, thank you for your time and sorry again for all the grammar mistakes i've made, i'm not very good at english :(

65,"After being consumed by my own thoughts with no real answers...I've turned to you guys.

I've slowly become a very different person than I was in the past, and I'm really struggling with it.  It's also affecting my marriage as my wife feels like I'm different than the guy she married (and she's right)

I've always been more introverted than not.  Not to an extreme degree, but given the option I'm more likely to want to stay home and play some video games than go to a bar.  That being said, I used to enjoy going out for drinks, happy hour, maybe a weekend trip, vacation etc.  Slowly over time though, I find myself way less interested in anything that's terribly social.

I'd say starting about 5 years ago until now (with the last 2 being the most significant), I've progressively become more uptight and less ""fun"".  I would choose staying home and watching a movie, or playing on my computer over dinner, drinks, any activity etc. I would take being at home, ordering food, hanging with my dog and playing some online game or binge watching TV over anything else.  I've also become really sensitive to changes in plans.  If we are supposed to do one thing and someone wants to change it or do something else, I get all worked up.  A great example would be if we are going out to dinner with my wife and friends.  If the plan was ""Have one drink and then dinner"" and it turns into ""Have one drink, dinner and then another bar or place after"" I'll immediately be annoyed.  One, because I don't like the idea of being out longer than we agreed and I want to get home and just relax.  And two because I would feel like it's infuriating that we can never stick to a plan.  We also have to extend whatever we are doing.  The feeling I get when things don't go ""my way"" is more than just minor annoyance, it's a true frustration/anger and I get a tight feeling in my chest.  I feel very out of control and anxious.

Some other odd things that I've noticed have changed in me:

I don't like loud, busy places. (I would hate hate hate a concert)
I prefer peace and quiet, even at home.  If my wife plays music or the TV loud it annoys me.
If my wife is tired, I love that because it means a lazy, low key night.
If my wife takes sleeping pills, I like that because it means she'll be relaxed and chill.
I have tons of anxiety about my dog.  I'm always worried about him, if he's happy, or stressed, or home alone too long or feeling neglected etc.  If we go to my in-laws lake house I'm always super concerned and stressed about him and whether or not he's feeling okay or if the sun is too hot, does he have enough water (especially on the boat).  I feel like it's a bit much but can't help it.

My big dilema is:  Is this the new me?  Am I being true to myself?  Or is there something like anxiety/depression that's got it's hold on me that is influencing my behavior?  I feel like the care free version of myself is gone and I'm so damn uptight.  I act like I'm 70, not in my mid 30s.  My wife is becoming increasingly affected by this too, as I'm pretty much a ""deadbeat"" when it comes to our life and just want to be home all the time.

66,"Hey,

I'm a 23yo who probably can't live with 'everything's ok'. Work's fine, my relationship is fine, everything seems to be working out for me, I can't really complain on anything but for over 2 weeks I feel like there's something wrong and it hit me last night that I always lived with lots of problems, feeling unaccepted (gay) and like I didn't belong. Right now I have a supportive boyfriend that I started pushing away asking for space and some time alone, 2 jobs where I don't really have problems and friends that support me. 

I don't normally fight the sadness, in the past I just accepted it and I'd spend 2-3 weeks, sometimes even a month dealing with it my own way - by being alone with my thoughts and I'd just pass and I would go back to my normal life. Right now I can't really do that as my British boyfriend wants to spend every minute with me and thinks that if I'm quiet there's something wrong (I told him it's just a difference in our cultures and generations). 

Do you guys know any good movies/youtube channels/books that'd help me get over it? I feel like most of the books focus very depressed people, who are having midlife crisis, not many of them acknowledge the fact that 20-year olds have sometimes similar problems. I have few days off coming up and I could use a good read/watch to help me deal with this difficult time. 

Thanks in advance!",03Apr2018,1,
67,"Ok so i have been doing all this ""extra work"" on myself recently and this is time to try and cut out the background noise of self loathing about doubt and get some clear thoughts down.
So here goes.  

Last week i had a moment of clarity ( or so i thought) 

i have tried many times to make big changes in my life and suffered for it, but that does not mean I didn't learn from it. I noticed cycles and patterns in my behaviour. Whenever I had a moment of clarity and knew what the ""missing piece"" was, I would jump head first into making that piece fit into my world.
 I then burnt out within a week and could spend the next few months in a heavy depression and have to rebuild again, usually this meant I lost jobs, pushed those closest to me away rejecting help I desperately needed.

This was not a pleasant experience coming to this realization while the cycle was going off on full scale nuclear meltdown mode. You know the ""burn the evidence"" type of stuff. All because i decided i want to go into education at 29 years old. 


So after last week everything is still pretty raw and dark. The burnout and resulting deep depression has been severe in comparison to previous episodes. 
however
Spotting cycles, triggers and patterns has been far easier than before. But the dark impending cloud is not diminishing.
 in the past i noticed three main consequences of my poor mental health and lack of mental hygiene which i hope not to repeat. 

""usually this meant I lost jobs, pushed those closest to me away rejecting help I desperately needed."" 

1. lost jobs
2. pushed people away 
3. rejected help

So... How have i tried to make sure i am correcting behaviour and learning from myself?

1. Started wearing a personal ""totem"" ring which can serve as a constant reminder,"" my life is a journey, make sure not to loose yourself along the way""
2. i have been open with those close to me, no matter how much i want to chew the bitter pill and hold on to it all. I have to let it out!. Even if it is small chunks to start with, i am committed to using my network when i am low and share in the smiles when i am not. 
3.  I have called the primary care mental health team to start my commitment to dealing with my depression.

Great! 
You would think so huh?.
Now comes the issue. None of the three main actions have any bearing on my ""work life"".

Work is probably THE biggest  ""cog dis""  issue in my life at the moment and has been for a long time.  I have had way to many jobs in 6 years, its been tough.
I have worked in fast food , construction, IT, call centres, kitchens, bars, coffee shops ,plant hire. 
Now either i am an idiot who is just bad at this whole work thing and should give up and be miserable. OR  am i simply human and still looking for a job that may ""fill that hole"".

Unnaturally i am going to go with the latter. 

So what do i do?.

1. Keep working though it, risk more burnout and episodes of depression and hopefully have the mental energy to give college or uni a go in 8 months time.
2. stop working, cut out the cog dis issue of working for an employer who i do not respect due to his lack of concern for his workers. And focus solely on myself. 
3. Find a new job and apply further change in a high tension time just for a extra wage.

These and more are among the many scenarios being played out behind the scenes in unrelenting loops, and halting my decision making process. 

Easy decisions to some are not easy for me when i have 3 kids and the love of my life to be a good ""working dad"" for. 

So that is where i have managed to get to so far in dissecting myself during an episode of depression. Its been tough but... 
I feel the need now, not to forget the basics of self care.
 Plus... Isn't procrastination fun.
Why do something about it when you can write about doing it instead!.

"" Don't complain about something, you are not willing to change ""

Now that sounds a like a great idea, accept when i am too busy hating myself for not being able to get a handle on my depression.

So i am trying to remind myself :

not only to deal with the lows better but to aim for the highs.

Be kind to myself when i need it, and be brave when it matters.

And most importantly: stop procrastinating and do something about it. 

Signing out!.

71,"Hi,

Just wondering if anyone has tried an inpatient mental health program, whether voluntary or involuntary? 

I've struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life, but over the past year or so it has gotten a lot worse. I've tried psychiatrists and therapists with little relief. I was on Zoloft (300mg) and Wellbutrin (200mg) most recently and while I was feeling great for about a year, it's like the meds just stopped working and back down into a slump I went. I stopped the Wellbutrin when that happened and got hollered at by my psychiatrist. She then wanted to put me on Lithium but after reading things online about it turning you into a zombie, I stopped seeing her.

The therapist I most recently saw was extremely nice and seemed knowledgeable, however, while opening up about my feelings helped, when I left her office it was back to the real world and everything we had discussed went right out the window.

So I've now been thinking about trying a 5-10 day inpatient program with group therapy, medical evals, etc and was hoping for some first hand experience. I feel like this is my last choice. 

I haven't tried killing myself, but I do think about it alot. Just sick of the same shit everyday. Seems like there's no point continuing, blah, blah. For what, so I can work another 30 or so years until my health deteriorates so bad that I sit in front of a tv all day watching Jeopardy, eating Jello, and shitting myself?! Plus, I have no kids of my own so it's not like I need to be around to watch them grow up.

Anyway, thanks for any feedback!",03Apr2018,1,

74,"Hey all, i hope this is the right place to post. Was considering /r/health but that seems more of professional posts.


I made a post about 6 years ago about Rumination syndrome, and today i got a message about it. My post 6 years ago was vague and not really all that helpful because at the time i was still throwing up twice a day.


I spent 12 years of my life vomiting a couple times a week, up to twice a day. I was told it was prob acid reflux or IBS. I saw dozens of different doctors and was on all sorts of different medications. But it never helped, and i never felt like it quite fit the bill. I spent 12 years in and out of doctors offices and no one could tell me what was wrong. It was very stressful for my entire family and took a large negative effect on my health- Anxiety, teeth issues, sometimes throw up blood, damage to the throat.


Even today when i discuss Rumination syndrome with my doctors, i have only met one doctor who knew what it was- and he was the one that diagnosed me.


Rumination syndrome for me went like this- I would feel perfectly fine. Start eating, and after a few bites i just KNEW i was going to throw up. There was no nausea before hand, no stomach pains or any other symptoms. It would be like 3 bites into a cheese burger, my stomach would ""turn over"" (feel upset), my mouth would salivate excessively and then i would run to the bathroom and vomit. The vomiting wasnt painful or acidic, it was just me clearing out my stomach. After i threw up everything, I would feel perfectly fine. In fact, i would go sit down and finish my meal and feel 100% ok afterwords. No amount of antacids helped.

I suffered from age 12-24, and i was always anxious and worried about the vomiting. But after 12 years it was kind of second nature. I had given up on doctors finding the answer. (hell i event went to the mayo clinic in MN to try and fix it). And then one day i threw up like normal, but this time i threw up blood as well. Which i have had happen several times in the past- always just a tear in the stomach lining/throat. I went to a small time gastro clinic, (had to have the cut cauterized or stapled before), and instead of doing that the doctor heard my symptoms and just goes ""rumination syndrome"". I didnt even go looking for an answer to the illness. And BAM out of nowhere i had an answer. To this day that was one of the best days of my life. I sat in my car laughing and crying at the same time. 

Finding the correct diagnoses helped me tremendously. After i knew exactly what it was, i knew how to fix it. Rumination syndrome is caused by mental health issues- often found in babies or people suffering from things like severe autism. But I am neither. I have always had mental health issues- PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, OCD. And Rumination syndrome was just one more.

After i found out what it was i did research into how to stop it. Read things like ""when you feel sick chant reinforcing phrases to yourself in your mind"". And ""do deep breathing"". I spent a solid 2 years practicing deep breathing, which helped quite a bit. I would take a few bites, wait untill i started to feel the nausea, and then id stop. Sit up straight and take deep breaths. In threw the nose out threw the mouth. And sip on water. This helped quite a bit, but i would still throw up a couple times a week. When i was doing my deep breathing id change my thoughts to ""im not going to throw up"" or ""im not sick"". But that never did much. I was skeptical because ""how can simply changing what you say to yourself help"", but I was talking to my psych about it once, and he said ""dont use words like vomit, sick, or throw up"" Anything that is a negative stimulus. Was told to change my mindset to ""I am healthy"". I did as i was told. I continued practicing deep breathing, but added a chant of ""i am healthy"" when i started to feel sick. It took a while, but after a couple months. I noticed a SERIOUS drop in vomiting. I was put on an anti-anxiety medication as well because a lot of my vomiting was caused by anxiety/stress. 

And i am 29 now. Every year since i was like 26 i have had less and less vomiting, in fact the last time i threw up was like 5 months ago.

I hope this post is ok, i just wanted to make one in case i can help someone who has rumination syndrome and doesnt know it. Its easy to think its acid reflux, but they feel totally different. And  as i have said, i have seen 50+ doctors and run a ton of different tests and i was never given an accurate diagnoses. It seems most doctors dont even know about the illness. Im hoping if someone googles their illness/symptoms they can see this and learn about the illness or ways to combat it. Because i know the day i learned the exact cause of my vomiting was one of the happiest days of my life.",03Apr2018,4,
75,"I'm a 27 year old man.  I have no interest in anything.  What few hobbies I've maintained over the years generally go untouched nowadays.  The skills I once took pride in no longer seem important to me.  I can't read anything for more than five seconds without my mind wandering.  My audibles credits are piling up.  I can't watch TV or play videogames anymore because it all sucks.  Every single thing on Netflix just seems like children playing with toys on a stage.  Every new game is a pointless hampster wheel that gets boring before I finish my first beer.  I have no social life whatsoever and basically don't know anybody outside of my immediate family, and I avoid speaking to them as much as possible.  I'm thinking of not showing up for work anymore and seeing how long it takes for police to drag me out of my studio apartment due to not paying rent or responding to the landlord's calls.  I just want to lay down and become completely unresponsive and uncooperative indefinitely and passively observe what humanity does about it.  I can't think of anything better to do.  I'm not just saying that, I might actually do it.  I swear to fucking God this is a strong possibility for my near future.

I know this sounds like depression, but I don't feel depressed.  I feel fine.  I don't ruminate over thoughts of low self-esteem or anything like that, I don't cry myself to sleep at night, and I've never considered suicide in my life.  I just don't feel anything or see the point of living my life anymore.  I feel like a new life might help, but I can't imagine what that would be like or how to achieve that, and I don't think I have the energy to even put effort into anything anyway.  I want an earthquake to suddenly destroy everything right now and put me in a dramatic survival situation.",03Apr2018,3,

79,"We have a family member who has us very concerned. We aren't sure if he's receiving proper mental health help and he has been scaring a few of us.

So the gist is, he likes to visit us out of the blue, often. He'll show up whether it's a good day or not. Now here's where things get concerning

For the most part he'll sit in a corner quietly, and randomly bring up a seemingly obscure topic directly to his ""person of the day"".

By person of the day, I mean he'll follow this person to every single room, and will talk to this person endlessly. He'll speak and bring up topics like, ""Do you like medicine?"" ""do you like this movie?"" ""do you have allergies?"" at random, even if the conversation was about, say, vegetables.

There was a point where he was obsessed with horror movies, and subsequently serial killers. He would follow my sister around talking about serial killers and scare her.

He once had a job, and during his shift his boss had trouble finding him, he was found walking up and down a cemetery by himself.

He claims to see a doctor, and therapist, and be in rehab. He takes medicine of some sort but what we don't know.

He claims to have been heavy into drugs before, and always had some new disorder he's bringing up he has.

Any ideas on what exactly is going on with him?",03Apr2018,2,

82,"Crossposted in r/anxiety but got no answers. 

Over the last few years I've been in a really bad mental state, this past year has gotten exponentially worse. A lot of big changes happened in my life that caused me to become more isolated and alone than ever before.

Since around the same time things got bad, I started smoking weed every day to cope. Then around 2-3 weeks ago, I got a big bottle of RC benzos for cheap and have been taking them every day so often that I barely notice. I'll just take another dose like taking a tic tac or something....

Now I have extreme anxiety whenever I'm not high in some sort of way. I really really want to be dead because of how ashamed I am about my lack of friends/social life, along with the constant negativity I can't stop feeling. I have no idea what to do or where to go, I can't just quit taking my drugs because I've been using them so often that I'm reliant on them. And my doses with benzos are so unregulated that I have no clue how much I take each day, I've heard you can get seizures if you quit cold turkey after being on them for a while. Plus my mental state sober is just so unbearable. What do I do? I'm seeing a psychiatrist for the first time in a while tomorrow but I'm afraid it won't be enough.

I have been trying to exercise more, get my work done, etc but it isn't enough to raise my mood. The anxiety about only having like 2 friends is unbearable too, probably one of the things I'm focusing on the most though.",03Apr2018,2,

85,"Hello! I am an 18 year old female currently in College. I am looking for help from a mental help professional. I have a lot of abandonment issues, as well as very bad anxiety and depression. I would love to be able to talk about my concerns with someone and work things out that have been making me depressed. 

I don’t really understand how insurance works, like at all. I do know that I have health insurance (via my mothers work), but from what I can tell, it isn’t the best. What my mother tells me, she has to pay for a lot of her appointments and procedures upfront (she is currently recovering from a nasty ankle break she got while visiting NYC). 

I would really like to see someone about my mental health, but I don’t know how to go about it. I am super concerned about being a financial burden on my mother, as she already has a lot of medical bills, and a job that does not pay enough. I also don’t know how to tell her without her feeling guilty. All that being said. I don’t know how I can seek help without her. 

So Reddit, I need advice on how to seek mental health without paying a ginormous amount of money. I am really scared that without some guidance and help, I will never get to live life to the extent that I really want to. 

Thank y’all ahead of time!!! I really appreciate it!!!  ",03Apr2018,2,
