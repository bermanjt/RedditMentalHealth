0,"Hey I'm 18 living in the UK. I had a lot of issues last summer after getting hospitalised from use of drugs. I was never addicted but just had a really bad experience with psychedelics which has put me off for life. Also ended up losing my girlfriend at the time because of it all. 

After recovering I started working  a fast food job four or so days a week in about Novermber 2017 with so set schedule every week so I could earn some money. Its now March and I feel in a bit of a rutt. I'm quite different to a lot of the people I work with and my social anxiety makes it difficult to interact with my colleagues at work. Once im there I can deal with it and get through it but the time upcoming to any shift i just find to hard. I become obsessed with what time it is and cant focus or enjoy anything because im always checking the clock to see how much free time I have left. 

This has left me feeling very tired and unfocused in general finding it difficult to put any work into making progress in the career i want to purse which is fashion. 

I dont know if im just being lazy, stupid or I need help figuring out how I can overcome this and move forward. Any advice is much aprreciated, thanks a lot.",04Mar2018,6,
1,"I've recently been told by some close people around me that I should possibly go to the doctors. I'm not entirely sure what's wrong with me but I have been putting it off for a while. I convince myself into thinking I'm completely fine. Sometimes I feel like I'm on top of the world, I'm the absolute best ever, life feels like it's going in the right direction EVERYTHING is f**king fantastic, I get excited over absolutely everything I CANNOT shut up, I will talk about anything and everything I feel so great, I act like a lunatic! Then other times it's the complete opposite I want to die, life isn't worth living, I have a pit in my stomach, I don't know what to do with myself, I'm a crying mess and all my dreams and ambitions mean nothing anymore, I hate myself so much, life is meaningless all my relationships are doomed and I just want to die. I was diagnosed with Anxiety and depression when I was 15 or so? Could this be some form of ADHD as well as? God I'm so lost. Sorry I just wanted to vent. ",04Mar2018,1,
2,"Hello everyone,

I was hoping to get some insight from other folks who have used Strattera or atomoxetine for ADHD treatment. I was on 40mg for a month and moved on to 80mg for three months before I had to stop. I have had suicidal thoughts before.... but this was nothing like I have ever experienced. My thoughts felt tangible... doable. For about a week I told myself it was just a bout of depression due to my relationship ending but two and a half weeks into it I found myself becoming more and more accepting of my suicidal thoughts and even began planning. It was a version of me that I knew should not exist.

I quit without consulting my psychiatrist. I know that was stupid. I know I should have called him. (Called and left a message right before I came on here to let him know). But in about a week I noticed a massive change in my mental status. A month off of it and though my ADHD symptoms are raging full fledged again, but I am clear headed and much much happier/more accepting of my position in life. 

Has anyone else had experience with this? Would you mind telling me the steps you took after? I want to avoid stimulants. I am stupid when it comes to addictive drugs and I don’t want to have a problem with stimulants. Are there other options besides strattera? 

Thank you!",04Mar2018,1,
3,"I have been having cognitive problems for years that have gradually been getting worse. There are times now that I cannot even complete a sentence because I will get so confused in what I’m saying. Often times I can’t complete a full thought without trailing off or forgetting what I’m talking about. I’m only 21.
I also am frequently dizzy and when I’m at work I can be looking at my computer screen doing something and then suddenly I’m clicking from tab to tab and it’s like my mind has forgotten that I’m even supposed to be working to begin with.
I also have increasingly weird pms symptoms where I just want to grovel and I’m really needy for attention the week before my period.

I talked to my GP about this and he said he didn’t think it was psychiatric and ran tests for diabetes, thyroid, etc. Everything looked fine.
I talked to my therapist about this and she says more therapy should help but doesn’t think I need any medication.

The problem is the longer I sit on this the worse it is. I feel so disconnected from life because everything is turning into a blur. I need a fix or I’m going to lose my job and my relationships! ",04Mar2018,1,
4,"Hey everyone, I’m here to ask the thoughts of others. So my boyfriend and I have a 2 year old daughter.  My boyfriend has a brother who has battled a long time with depression, drug addiction and other various mental health issues.  Recently he has been diagnosed with schizophrenia (paranoid schizophrenia I believe, he laughs a lot audibly to things he’s hearing etc) He’s seems great with our daughter (his niece) but something feels uneasy about this.   I am not sure why. He’s never harmed her, but I do know his past behaviors. My daughter loves him and hand loves her. But I work part time at a home for people with mental health issues such as his. So I’m around this behavior regularly. I know everyone isn’t the same, and everyone’s diagnoses are unique to their situation. But I always think the worst when he is hanging around her. Am I being overbearing or is it normal for me to feel this way? ",04Mar2018,5,
5,"So I've noticed this for the past 2 weeks. It started with the whispering. Within the first week, about 3 times I thought random people I've never met sitting behind me had whispered my name. It's always in the person that was actaully behind me's voice and doesn't happen when I'm alone; only when others are speaking.

Then I started to see things. First, it was just shadows that I thought were people. Then, one time I was walking into the bathroom and thought somebody was standing at the sink. Thought it was just my sister brushing or something. It took me 10 seconds to realize nothing was there at all. I literally had the *feeling* you get when somebody is next to you.

This one happened today. I was at work, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw my coworker with a skull mask on. Scared the shit out of me but it went away when I looked at her.

Also, I have some weird, delusional thoughts, but they're insignificant and I can immediately dismiss them and laugh about how dumb they were. 

I'm still able to have conversations and make people laugh, which is a good sign. Social anxiety and performance anxiety are still there but I've dealt with that all my life. For the past 6 months, I've also been having mood swings.

Like I said, I have trouble getting to sleep at night because my brain can't stop thinking, so I'm tired all of the time and is probably leading to my confusion.

I've been feeling depressed and stressed out for a while but this is starting to point towards something more serious. I'm hoping it's just anxiety.

13,"I was hospitalized over 2 years ago after trying to off myself. Spent about a week there and it turned out to be one of the most pleasant experiences of my life. I met so many people around my age that were experiencing some of the same things I was feeling, which helped give me a different perspective at a time when I had felt so alone. Everyday felt genuinely different, even though I was confined to the same living space and had a set schedule, I felt like I was getting something out of the time I had there, like I was having the biggest break of my entire life so far. I was expecting everything to go up from there but it just led to one of the worst years of my life with the next one being only a bit better. Honestly, I think about that place so often. Even if the memories of what I did there starts to fade, I remember what I felt and I really miss it. It just feels like it was the last time I really had a chance to feel comfortable. Granted, my current headspace is a lot better than back then. I still feel like I'm missing something that I had only ever had during my time in the hospital. Does anyone else who's been hospitalized feel the same way? ",04Mar2018,1,
14,"(TL;DR - realizing that having a feeling of ""why bother, the world is crashing and burning"" might actually be anxiety?)

So short background - I'm working on overcoming a problem in my life and the process had required some hard mental work. As I'm going through this process I'm starting to realize that I might be struggling with some stuff I've just kind of been ignoring or repressing. 

Here's the more pointed story/question: I've avoided relationships and school and stuff because in the back of my mind it seems like anything that takes any length of time (like finishing school) is pointless because there's just no way the world will make it that far. Something catastrophic has to happen. All that work, all that money, all the effort that would go into a healthy relationship... There's no reason. It's all just going go end. 
Anyway, recently I've started to realize that those thoughts might actually be a manifestation of anxiety that's more severe than I've admitted to myself previously. I do ocassionally have panic attacks but usually now in my adult life they're controllable. Part of what made me realize/think about this was a question that was asked at a psychological evaluation I had to do recently. They ask if you feel a sense of dread or impending doom or something and I if course answered no because 1 I know that's what I'm supposed to say and 2 I guess I'm just now starting tonrealize that maybe having that feeling about the future isn't normal? 
So I challenged myself to start to work past that feeling and invest in my future and a better life by getting back into school and working on my long term goals more activity and thats going great. I'm just wondering I guess if this really is anxiety, maybe I should be seeking treatment for it? I don't want it to sneak back in and derail me when I'm not expecting it... Its kind of a deep dark hole to claw out of and I don't want to do it again. Lol ",04Mar2018,1,

16,"Last year, I got hit with adult acne. It got progressively worse and I ended spending a lot of money and time trying to fix it. With products, going to all kinds of doctors, medication, etc..

It’s gotten slightly better, a lot of scarring left but overall less pimples in general.

However, I’ve somewhat become obsessed with my face and whenever a new spot appears, I feel like it’ll all comeback. My skin is definitely not what it used to be when it was clear and not as bad when it was at its worst but I can’t help but feel like it’s still a problem.

I avoid sunlight as much as I can, I constantly try to avoid mirrors if I know I’m having an off day yet I constantly am looking at mirrors to see what new spots or marks are on my face. 

I’ve changed my diet to a less sugar and carb one (it makes my acne worse) and it’s making me lose weight and I’m already underweight. Another thing is that I get upset if I lose weight because I don’t want to be a stick. It’s a constant battle what I eat. The foods that will help me gain weight is bad for my face and food that is good for my face makes me too skinny.

I don’t want to live like this. I used to have decent skin two years ago and I was at an acceptable weight. Now I feel like a hollow mess that constantly worries about what I eat and how I live my life. I want to be normal again.

What should I do???

18,"We are going to discuss the details of the break tomorrow. Although I want what's best for her, I'm skeptical. She said we're still in a relationship, but we should start communicating less and have less facetime calls (we are currently long distance). She told me she thinks this break will help her because she knows I also need her support. The fact that she can't give it to me because of her condition makes her sad and even more depressed - which is why a break would help.

She lives alone and she doesn't have any friends living close to her (we both aren't from the US and neither of us had much luck in finding friends here). I fear that she's trying to push me away. I probably shouldn't make assumptions before we have finalized the details, but I can't stop thinking about it.

Is she doing this because she genuinely thinks it is going to improve her mental state, or is she just pushing me away so she can isolate herself even more?",04Mar2018,1,

20,"I have this issue where I don't do anything beneficial for myself out of apathy. Sure, a common occurence and I've had multiple people around me with the same 'depressive' conditions. But many of them have grown up and picked up theirselves and are actually progressive through life. As I have not done anything about it, this makes me despise them so bad (kind of subconsciously). Realizing that made me feel like such an awful person.

Of the top of my head, an example, would be relationships. When someone close to me gets into a relationship, I only look forward to the day they break up and feel the pain of it. I myself am realistically able to get a girlfriend if I put in the effort, but the fact that I don't while someone else does fucks my mentality up to think that they are wrong (therefore should suffer) and I am right by not doing anything. And it's not only relationships (starting to go the gym or studying i.e.).

Is this also a common condition? Can I do something to stop it? I am not a bad person to anybody and I never sabotage things. But secretly I want thinge to get sabotaged by themselves. Fuck me.",04Mar2018,3,

31,"It's hard to explain, but I'm really scared of it. The not knowing if I see people I love again, not knowing if I go into another body, not knowing if it's just darkness...

I suffer from bad depressive disorder, panic disorder, GAD and have previously attempted as well as self harmed in various ways.

I wonder if a lot of my fear comes from losing my Grandad at a young age - he and my Grandmother pretty much raised me. My mother (their daughter) was an alcoholic til I was 16, I remember them clearing 2 garbage bags of bottles and cans from under her bed at the end of every week. It was normal for me. They'd clean up and feed me and take me to school and by the time my father got home from work, my mother was pretty much getting ready for bed, so it was a big facade. Grandad passed away when I was 9...suddenly developed pancreatic cancer after pains going undiagnosed for a while. He went into hospital on the Monday and was gone on the Friday. My parents split after this, a bf my mother eventually had, fractured her skull by smashing her head off the wall because she'd chosen to meet with a potential new employer for an interview rather than go drinking with him. He thought he'd killed her because she was unconscious. He wrapped her up in plastic to dump her body then fled when he realised she was still alive. He knocked my aunt's door to say ""I just murdered your sister."" I only learned about the plastic part a couple weeks ago. I was with my grandmother when all this went on, and I just remember being told that my mother was in a coma. I accidentally found the evidence photos of her beaten to a pulp, saw left over blood on the wall...somehow all the evidence ""got lost"" in court, as has happened in many of his past  domestic incidents involving women. I served this guy at work the other day. He had no idea who I was, called me hun, all smiles...how I didn't flip I don't know. I'm 25 now, hadn't seen him since I was 10 or so. 

After this my mother moved in with my grandmother, the drinking got increasingly worse and we would have physical fights til I ran away when I was 12. My Dad took me on and I've lived with him since, in a homeless hostel and 2 houses. 

There's a bunch more stuff that's gone 9n but I'm thinking this sudden loss of my Grandad and then nearly losing my mother is what makes me so frightened.

It's funny because I love horror and gore and true crime.  

For the most part, I'm okay.  I've been in a relationship 8 years (first relationship for us both. He is very supportive of my MH problems), I work full time, am medicated, do animal rescue work and rehabilitation w shelters in my spare time, but my mental health is still a lot to deal with. 

I remember seeing Faces of Death and having a panic attack over thinking of what happens after death, mostly because I'm scared of losing people. That's when I really started obsessing. I over think and obsess a lot. I've always had ""why am I here, what's the point"" intrusive thoughts since I was a child. I remember wanting toys when I was a kid and a voice in my head said ""what's the point in having Anything? One day you'll be dead."" This was not long after Grandad passed. 

Anyone else have bad panic attacks over it? I wish I could go back to before I first overthought it all, so it didn't freak me out so much...maybe with what's happened I was just bound to develop this crazy fear? It's hard to explain. 


Hopefully some of you will kinda see what I am trying to say. Well, I hope not actually, because it's horrible to think like this

She will do things like dishes, clean, crafts and go on the computer for at least 24 hours straight. She could go longer but i cut her off around that time. The problem is she will ""sleep"" and then wake up and continue. The thing is i don't think she's getting a deep sleep because when she does finally hit a deep sleep she is out for 2 days. So usually when she get's up after 8 hours it's because she was having a very light sleep and is excited to get up and continue her projects. 

Now when she stays up around the 20 hour mark she starts to act a little wired up and speedy. Makes me nervous. She 100% does not take any drugs besides COPD medicine and Effexor. 

A couple of times after staying up for a couple days she has had a bad panic attack and had to be tajen to the hospital. She claims it's a COPD flare up but this has only ever happened after she has stayed up. Also every time the doctors find no signs of a flare up and send her home a few hours later. 

I just want her to be able to go into a deep normal sleep after being up for 24 hours and stop obsessing over these projects and maybe just have one night a week where she stays up.

36,"TL;DR: brain fucked, pls help

So my mental health history is extremely complicated but I’ll try to shorten it as much as possible. Lifelong adhd, turned into severe depression as teenager etc. Around 20 years old  in college I had a psilocybin experience that made me realize it was possible to not feel depressed and feel connected with my body. After this I became determined to do everything possible to mitigate any external depression causing factors. I cleaned up my diet, limited alcohol, kept up regular exercise, limited drugs/alcohol, started meditating, reading spiritual texts, switching to non-stimulant ADHD meds, etc. Within a few months, I began to feel true joy and happiness that I had never known before. For about a year, everyday was a joy to live and virtually all depression and anxiety had vanished. I was doing 10x better in school and became passionate about learning for the first time. Things were not perfect of course, I was also dealing with chronic nerve pain in my face that ironically served to further somewhat slow my ADHD brain down and allow me to focus more. I was also dealing with occasional binge eating episodes (this had started years back) but I had finally opened about it to some people close to me and was practicing lots of self-love/compassion. In general though I felt a hope for the future I could have never imagined prior. 

After about a year, I started to struggle more with school. My memory of exact events is fuzzy due to events I will soon get into. I remember eventually asking my psychiatrist if I had could add stimulants back on top of the non-stimulant I was taking because my performance was beginning to struggle, which I did. Very large amounts. I remember beginning to feel increasingly more stressed and having more binge eating episodes, to the point where I was even sneaking leftover pastries home from my coffee shop job (the exact opposite of what I should be eating). 

Anyway, by the end of the school year, I was exhausted and burned out. I had a met a really cool group of guys though over the past few months and I soon moved into a new house with all of these new people for the summer. This is where my first major mistake happens. I decided I wanted to try going off all meds to see how I would feel. (As a side note, one of the meds I was on was an atypical antidepressant for my chronic pain. While I initially was on a very low dose, over time it was increased to be on actual antidepressant amounts even though I still believed it to be at a low/non-therapeutic dose. So I imagine now that this drug had also played a good a role in how I felt so good the past year, but at the time I had thought it was purely for my chronic pain. And I had just had a septoplasty which doctors thought was causing the pain, so I thought I did not need chronic pain meds anymore.) Anyway, I was not taking summer school that year so I figured this would be the best time to try not being on adhd meds. My second big mistake was also telling myself to relax more about my eating, so I could “fit in” more with the new guys I was living with. I began to drink a lot of beer and eat other crap and began to feel very bad but I ignored it I guess. It’s extremely hard to remember. 

Now this is where things get complicated. 
About 2 months later, I went on a trip with some friends. I had just started taking adhd meds again recently because it was clear I was doing poorly, but of course of all things I forgot to bring, I forgot my meds. I thought about flying back home but I instead tried to take it as a sign for one more chance to see how I do without meds. As another note, I was actually not good friends with most of the people on this trip. They were mostly friends of my main friend who was staying somewhere else in the city while we were all in a hostel like situation. But we got along and it wasn’t a big deal. A few days in to the trip, one of the people brought out a bag of mushrooms. I was still feeling pretty terrible from the past couple months, but I was immediately reminded of the life-transforming experience I had the last (and only) time I took them. I told myself I would try it in an attempt to reconnect with myself spiritually. In hindsight, there were so many red flags not to do this, but I was not on my meds and not in a right state of mind. The first time I did them, my friends at the time had all been very careful to measure the amounts so no one took too much. This time, it was basically going around in a circle until the bag was empty. To make a long story short, I had the most traumatic experience of my life. For 4-5 hours I was basically passed out on a bed having horrific and vivid visions that I truly believed were real. It culminated in me believing I was 90 years old being abused in a prison cell in Guantanamo bay (I was in San Diego so there were helicopters flying) and had gone insane from the trip and been incarcerated ever since, doomed to go in and out of conscious in a fate worse than death. When it finally wore off, I was truly amazed that I was alive. The relief was overwhelming, and the first thing I did was walk outside and hug one of the guys and literally say “I thought I was dead”. This relief lasted for about 10 minutes before the reality of what I had experienced began to sink in. 

Life after this soon became worse than hell. Soon after I got back I knew I was fucked up and I began going to therapy, but I could not get myself to verbally talk about what had happened. Meds that I had previously been on now weren’t helping and I felt that I had truly fucked up my brain chemistry. I began binge eating like an absolute monster. Within a month I had my first complete nervous breakdown, and I would have many more after the school year started. I began to take meds for panic attacks but I felt like I was in chronic state of fight or flight and absolutely nothing I tried to do could calm me down. I was studying neuroscience at the time and my thoughts became obsessed with how different parts of my brain that I had previously been so proud of were shrinking and atrophying from the extreme stress. Before now, I had truly believed I had suffered more than I could bear already from a lifetime of depression. The way I felt now was essentially hitting rock bottom, having the floor break, and then realizing there truly is no bottom. It can always, always, always get worse. This was the first but certainly not the last time I felt true despair. I spent most of the school year in denial to cope because I did not know what to do. Pretending I was the me from a year prior, doing and saying all the things that version of me would do. The chronic stress during this time was mind-shattering. There were a few binge episodes that were so bad that I came close to swallowing every pill I had. 

By the end of the school year, I was a hollow broken shell. I somehow managed to graduate (although I did fail my first class ever unsurprisingly) but I was begging and crying for death inside. My parents were trying to help as much as they could but they just couldn’t understand the depths of what I had experienced as much as they tried. I had planned to live at home after graduating but I was offered a job at a mental health clinic in my college town that really wanted me so I defeatedly took it. I couldn’t bear living with people at this point so I got my own apartment, which naturally was great for the binge eating. Over the next year or so thousands of dollars were shelled out out of desperation for experimental modalities like neurofeedback, TMS, etc. The binging continued to get worse, until I began expressing self-harm thoughts of cutting myself open and I was forced to quit my job and move home to my parents. 

It has been about a year and a half since then. I live in my own place close to my parents. I have healed a great amount since then and don’t require panic meds anymore, but I am still not close to my former self. My gut was absolutely destroyed from all the binging and I am working on healing that too. Especially with all the gut-brain research out now, it’s been incredibly difficult to heal my mind with my gut so fucked up and vice versa. I’ve been relying largely on alcohol to cope because little else has been able to do much, but I recently decided to quit. 

My main question now is: what should I do for my brain? Money is thankfully not an issue (or else I would be homeless and likely dead). I ask this because I honestly can’t tell if I’m depressed or not. It mainly just feels like there’s a rubber band around my prefrontal cortex that’s stagnating blood flow or something. And I am unable to be truly present or focus no matter how much I try. My body perception is also skewed with it feeling like my head is small and body is big despite being a skinny/average young male. ADHD meds do little for me now sadly. I’m wondering if things like ketamine or other experimental treatments would be worth looking into or if it’s just the cognitive issues that causing the depression. In which case I would look into more neurofeedback or nootropics or something. I have tried trauma work too which hasn’t helped at all, even though it’s been long enough where I can talk about it without much issue. I just want to feel like a capable human being again. I want to go back to school or work in a research lab somewhere, but it’s immensely difficult to learn when it feels like there is a rubber band wrapped around my brain all the time dulling my perception and feelings. Sorry this is so long, I just feel like context is always important. Any advice no matter how small would be greatly appreciated",04Mar2018,1,

Counsellor - not a protected title, usually only qualification is at diploma level. Best suited for those going through a rough time but who don’t suffer with mental illness.

Therapist - usually bachelor level university education, often in occupational therapy or psychology. Great choice for group therapy or behavioural therapy for those with or without a mental illness.

Psychologist - protected title, has studied psychology for at least six years at university level including postgrad study. Chose a psychologist over a counsellor for therapy if you are struggling with a mental illness.

Psychiatrist - a medical doctor who undertook extra study to become a psychiatrist. Choose over a GP for getting prescribed medication, they are highly specialised.",04Mar2018,8,
38,"Over the last year I've changed highschools twice(I'm 16), and been thrown into completely new environments. The first time, I recognized people. I had no idea from where, but I knew I had seen them before. The weeks passed, and after a while I realized I had not met them anywhere. It was just a figment of my imagination. 

The second time, which was a week ago tomorrow, the feeling of recognition was way weaker, but still existed. Especially now, I feel like I've seen some of my new friends before a week after I saw them for the first time. 

This happens out of school too, with singular people.

And it happens with music. I could've listened to a track 3-4 times, and suddenly I feel like I've heard the song earlier.

It's a little like a deja-vu, but not really. I can't put my finger on what separates the two, but they feel like different sensations. However, it should be noted that I get deja-vus fairly seldom, but they are extremely vivid when ttey come. 

It is super weird, and it creeps me out. I just want to know if it's something known, like if it's a connection in the brain(e.g. sneezing/bright lights) or if it's just me. It doesn't really bother me that much, as long as it doesn't evolve into anything worse. 

Thanks so much.

39,"I seriously need help because I feel like I won't make it out alive if I keep thinking the way I'm thinking. I've always suffered from anxiety/ panic attacks but recently I was at work and this intrusive terrible thought came over me ""what if life isn't real"" ""what if everything i'm experiencing is fake"" to me this is terrifying because I have a wonderful husband and 11 month old that I love so much. This thought has brought me to severe depression to the point where I'm having thoughts of taking my own life. I dont think I would ever act on that. But seriously. I feel so disconnected from the world, my family, my friends because my mind has literally led me to believe this is all fake. I can't do this. I have an appointment with the  pshyciatrist the 7th and I don't even feel like I can wait that long. I just want to check myself into a mental institution but I can't leave my son. I can't enjoy anything anymore. I feel like i'll never ever recover. Has anyone ever went through something similar? ",04Mar2018,15,

Basically, I'm on:

- Morning: 3mg bromazepam + 50mg sertraline.
- Midday: 3mg bromazepam + 1mg fluanxol.
- Evening: 40mg ziprasidone + 2.5mg lorazepam.

45,"So I believe that everyone has a right to die, including those who have committed suicide in the past, such as Chester Bennington, Chris Cornell, Kurt Cobain, Robin Williams, etc. As much as I love those guys, I believe it was their choice to make and not anyone else’s. I agree with Jack Kevorkian’s famous quote, “Dying is not a crime.”

I also believe that if someone is murdered, even if they’re close to me, even tho it’s sad, at the same time, I know it‘s natural to happen. As much as some people want to deny it, humans are animals. All animals are violent by nature.

I mean, Natural Selection is a basic part of animal nature. I feel like overpopulation on this planet prevents Natural Selection from doing its job, and if people were allowed to kill themselves and others, Natural Selection would be able to do its job and overpopulation wouldn’t be an issue.

Every night I've been thinking and stressing about school, my subjects and my grades as I'm trying to get into a new school next year (even though I'm 90% sure I get in). This has also made me staying up longer and not sleeping as well.
I really love art and music, but when I play with my band, I always feel like I'm not playing well, and disappointing. I also feel like I'm disappointing my teacher.
As for the art, every single time I step into the classroom or think of art class I get really nervous and feel like the teacher won't like my ideas, or be disappointed in my work, and now I don't feel like she likes me at all

I'm a 30 year old male with a decent size group of acquaintances and friends. When I do spend time with friends, they seem to have a good time with me. My feelings of loneliness stem from the fact that 99% of the time I am reaching out to others to make plans to hang out. It gets to a point where it feels like people don't want to spend time with me even though everything seems all good when I am with people. I know I'm likeable which makes it even more frustrating that people don't reach out to me to spend time together. It doesn't add up and I don't know what I'm doing wrong in my friendships. I'm aware that in the past I've had a pattern of only reaching out to people with the intent of hanging out. I'm working on this and have been reaching out to friends for casual conversation and to check in and see how they're doing. I'd appreciate any advice to help me feel better and point me towards feeling like my friendships are more reciprocal. 

Thanks 💜 ",04Mar2018,1,
